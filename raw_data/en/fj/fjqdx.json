In this task the Commission cannot act alone: we need to work together with the Member States, the European Parliament, t he scientific community and civil society and reach all the way through to the lo cal level, because t hat is where the repercussions of good - or bad - health policy are ultimately felt. Health policy can only be developed in a meaningful and relevant way if people whose quality of life the policy aims to improve are involved in shaping it. In a world where technology has exponentia lly increased the amount of information available, Europeans are more informed than ever before. Increas ingly well-educated and well-informed citizens expe ct to become more directly engaged with issues that concern their or their families' health and healthcare. To reflect this, civil society in the health sphere is increasingly organising itself at European level and its influence is growing. An informed and active civil society can play a key role in ensuring that citizens' concerns are heard in health policy-making. In addition, civil society organisations contribute to promoting health, info rming and supporting patients and raising awareness about health-related issues. I am therefore very pleased to see that stak eholders in the field of health are keenly participating in EU health policy and making their voice heard - the success of the Open Forum 2005 is a proof of that. We aim to continue strengthening citizen participation in our health policy making - I hope to be abl e to count on your support on this in the future.

They provide an overview of the key EU policy framework on specific issues and offer an opportunity for conference delegates to participate actively in debate. Parallel Session structure The Open Forum brings together a large number of participants and the parallelsessions are designed to meet the needs and interests of the range of people thatwill attend the event. Participants are invited to choose which parallel session they want to attend based on the brief overview in the following pages. All three parallel sessions will use thesame methodology and similar formats. The parallel sessions are divided into two distinct sections, a morning session from 11.30 - 13.00 and an afternoon session from 14.30 - 16.00. The focus of the morning session will primarily be a factual overview of the key EU legislative or policy initiatives on the workshop theme. This will allow participants to get up to date with the latest developments at EU level. The afternoon session will be interactive and allow more in-depth debate and discussion of the topics. The debate will be facilitated and will focus on 2-3 questions that will be highlighted by short statements from a panel by speakers withdiffering viewpoints. Participants at the Open Forum will be able to attend the morning session of a parallel session where they want to learn more about an issue and select theafternoon session according to the topics on which they would like to contribute tothe debate. All participants will have an opportunity to ' vote ' during the parallel sessions on the key statements that are put forward for in each parallel session. Each participant willreceive coloured stickers that will be used for an informal voting process that willtake place at the end of each morning session. The audience will be asked to voteon a scale of 1-5 (strongly agree to strongly disagree) on their agreement with thestatements. The results of the informal votes will be used as a basis for the debatein the afternoon session. Report to plenary The essence of the parallel sessions' discussions will be reported back to the plenarysession and will also be published in the report of the Open Forum. The parallelsessions' rapporteurs will share the results of the informal voting processes on thekey statements and any subsequent changes in position following the debate. Open Health Forum Health challenges and future strategy 5Parallel Session 1: Development of the EU Health Strategy Objective Public health first appeared as an explicit policy area in the EU Treaty in 1992. In the past decade there have been significant milestones in the development of healthpolicy at EU level. The creation of a Commissioner and DG for health and consumerpolicy (DG SANCO) in 1999 was followed by the adoption of the Public HealthProgramme in 2002. A public consultation in 2004 on a proposed EU health strategyelicited two hundred responses, which provided a basis for a proposal for a newHealth and Consumer protection programme for 2007-2013. The aim of thisworkshop will be to gather a range of views on what should be the key buildingblocks of a broad EU Health Strategy which is expected to be published in 2006. Morning Session Speakers from the European Commission, Parliament and Member States will beasked to set out their views on what is the appropriate role for the EU in health policy . Although most European countries face similar health challenges such as demographic change, rising levels of chronic disease and healthcare costs andsignificant health inequalities, there is no consensus on what added value the EU canbring in helping to tackle these issues. The growing threat of an influenza pandemicis an obvious and practical example of how the EU and national authorities need towork together to protect human health. Afternoon Session The debate will explore how much consensus can be created to build a shared vision of the European role in health . The European Commission has already a number of initiatives in place or planned on key health determinants such astobacco, alcohol consumption, mental health, food and nutrition and combatingHIV/AIDS. The discussion will look at how these could fit into an EU Health Strategy.Panellists will provide opinions about whether the EU should focus on areas ofgreatest need, e.g. pan European threats and causes of ill health or on issues wherethere is the greatest potential impact, e.g. where economies of scale are critical. Steering Group The steering group for this Workshop consists of: the European Public HealthAlliance (EPHA), Eurohealthnet, Mental Health Europe (MHE) with additional inputfrom Europa Donna and the European Committee for Homeopathy (ECH). Theinterests and expertise of those Associations will be reflected in the speakers andwill inform the debate that follows.Open Health Forum Health challenges and future strategy 6Parallel Session 2: Health Products: Pharmaceuticals and medical technology Objective The European Union plays a pivotal role in the regulatory framework for pharmaceuticals and medical technology. Public health and patient safety are two key aspects of the way that these products are regulated and used. In additioncompetitiveness and innovation are also important elements. However, there have been some recent examples of failure in the system; some products havecaused harm and some have failed to deliver benefits. Balancing cost withavailability of innovative products remains an important issue. The aim of thissession is to answer the provocative question of whether citizens can trust thesystem which regulates pharmaceuticals and medical technology products and whatthe EU could do to further enhance confidence in these sectors. The themethroughout the workshop will be how to balance the harm/benefit equation forpharmaceuticals and medical technology while retaining a competitive industry. Morning Session The first session will set out a broad overview of the EU regulatory frameworkincluding the key changes brought in by the Review of the EU pharmaceuticallegislation (completed in 2004), and the planned 'New Approach' to regulatingmedical devices and technology. Reference will be made also to the \"New IndustrialStrategy for the Pharmaceutical sector\" and other relevant policy and legislativeinitiatives. Institutional speakers will focus on patients, in particular the ways inwhich the regulatory framework ensures that both pharmaceuticals and medicaltechnology products reach the patients in a safe and effective manner . Afternoon Session The facilitated debate in the second session will look at the issue of new products and review how innovation and added value are measured and how efficacy andsafety are assessed. The question of tracking the safety of existing products and medicines will also be discussed through the pharmacogivilance and post- marketing surveillance systems. Finally the workshop will examine the importanceof information as a key factor underpinning public trust . The debate will focus on how the EU can develop an information strategy that will ensure good quality,timely, objective, reliable and non-promotional information for health providers,health professionals and patients. Steering group The steering group for this Workshop consists of: Pharmaceutical Group of theEuropean Union (PGEU), Health Action International (HAI), European Federation ofPharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), European Medical TechnologyIndustry Association (EUCOMED), European Association of PharmaceuticalWholesalers (GIRP). The interests and expertise of those Associations will bereflected in the speakers and will inform the debate that follows.Open Health Forum Health challenges and future strategy 7Parallel Session 3: Health Services Objective It is well known that the inclusion of health and social services in the draft Directive on Services in the Internal Market (COM(2004)0002) has caused considerable anxiety amongst the health community, with most health sector stakeholders calling for clarification of the inclusion of health services and somecalling an exclusion of health from the draft Directive entirely. The aim of thissession is to elucidate some of the issues underlying the anxiety about healthservices within the internal market and to explore selected aspects in greater detailin order to stimulate a debate between the participants. Morning Session The first session will consist of three presentations by experts from health practice,academia, and politics which seek to set out the key issues of health services withinthe European Union's internal market. The first speaker will present an overview of social and healthcare services in the context of the draft legislation on services in the internal market. Building on this background the following speakerswill look in greater detail at the way in which the issues of care quality, patient safety and access to health services can be addressed in the European Union. The first session will close with the presentation by the facilitator of two statementswhich raise the question the extent to which Europe can ensure a safe health caresystem in the EU and the extent to which a greater choice of healthcare providerscan improve healthcare across Europe. Afternoon Session Building on the votes of the audience in the first session, the second session willbegin with short contributions from experts which will kick off the debate. Thepurpose of the debate is to tease out some of the thorny issues involved in openingan internal market to health services whilst ensuring that such services meet thehighest standards of safety and quality and ensuring that all European citizens haveequal access to such services. Following the debate the audience will be asked torevisit their previous votes. Steering group The steering group for this Workshop consists of: EHMA (European HealthManagement Association), AGE (the European Older People's Platform), EFN(European Federation of Nurses Associations), CPME (Standing Committee ofEuropean Doctors), EPSU (European Public Services Union), EHTEL (EuropeanHealth Telematics Association) and ESIP (European Social Insurance Platform). Theinterests and expertise of those Associations will be reflected in the speakers andwill inform the debate that follows.

The contracts were signed on 2 August 2005 and the session took place on Tuesday 8 November 2005 at the Charlemagne building within the framework of the Open Health Forum meeting. As the contractor, EPHA had full responsibility for the successful delivery of all th ree sessions, although sub-contracting agreements were made with the Pharmaceutical Group of the EU (PGEU) for session 2 and with the European Health Management Associations (EHMA) for session 3. A website was established as a communication and coordination tool and an invitation issued to all members of the EU Health Policy Forum to express interest in joining steering committees for the sessions. The preparation for each session included the creation of a steering committee, development of the agenda and interactive mechanisms, invitations and briefing for speakers, drafting of background documents. During the Open Health Forum the contractor ensured that there was full logistical support for each session including liaison with the SCIC translation and conference service on room layout and equipment, logistical support for the chair, speakers and rapporteur. Additional staff were made available to hand out the voting slips and tally the results. For each session a rapporteur was also provided who made a report back to the Plenary session and drafted the written report for submission to the Commission. The sessions had a number of objectives: to provide an opportunity for a structure debate on key themes to allow participants to express their opinions to facilitate exchange between stakeholders. Although a formal evaluation of the Open Health Forum and the parallel sessions has not yet been carried out, it is clear that the sessions largely met these key objectives. The sessions were the result of close and constructive collaboration between the members of the steering committees which were established following an open and transparent call for expressions of interest. The steering committees ensured that a balance of viewpoints was represented but also lead to compromises on the approach to the session themes and on the number of speakers. During the sessions it became clear that fewer speakers or panel members might have allowed more space and time for debate. Nevertheless, the sessions featured lively discussions, votes on key questions and input by a range of participants. European Public Health Alliance Final Report 4 european public health alliance a.i.s.b.l. 39-41 rue d'Arlon B-1000 Brussels Belgium. 2 233 3880 Email epha@epha.org Website http://www.epha.org Report on Parallel Session 1: Development of the EU Health strategy Chairs : Ms Janice Cave, Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), Mr Clive Needle (Eurohealthnet) Rapporteur : Ms Lara Garrido-Herrero, European Public Health Alliance (EPHA) Overview of the debate The session started with viewpoints from two Member States, Lithuania and Finland (EU Presidency in late 2006). Both countries stressed the importance of subsidiarity but clearly identified potential for cooperation on European issues with an international dimension such as quality standards, safety, sharing information and capacities. Added value was available in the political and social dimension of health as well as through increasing knowledge. But the EU mandate in healthcare services and patient mobility must be clarified. Two differing opinions were offered by Members of the European Parliament (MEP). Mr Miroslav Mikolasik (Slovakia) hi ghlighted demographic change and a potential influenza pandemic as good reasons for EU cooperation but limited funds should be used in ways that can achieve the greatest impact. Ms Dorette Corbey (the Netherlands) stated that there is an inherent contradiction to be overcome. Health is legally and po litically a national issue and the recent 'no' votes to Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands show that citizens do not want Brussels interfering in their lives too much. But, people expect a lot from Europe and health matters a great deal to individuals. The EU should therefore motivate Mem ber States to cooperate rather than compel them. Health needs to be taken seriously by the European Commission. The Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Policy (DG SANCO) has to get out of its own policy arena, show real leadership and greater focus. All EU policies should contribute towards health or be changed or withdrawn. This means coherence - no more subsidising of unhealthy foods, tobacco growing or failure to limit pollution. Funds from the future seventh scientific Framework Research Programme (FP7) could be used to tackle differences in health outcomes across Europe and to reveal more about diseases. A speaker from DG SANCO explained how the results of the 2004 public consultation on health strategy had been integrated into the proposal for a new Health and Consumer Programme for 2007- 2013. A number of strong messages had been received, largely from NGOs: mainstream health, promote good health and prevent ill-health, allocate greater financial resources and involve stakeholders more closely, tackle inequalities and take on a stronger international role. The framework for the new programme reflects these inputs. A representative of the European Investment Bank (EIB) outlined the types of major financing it provides to the new Member States and the Balkan countries. Because of the lack of Community law in public health, during the accession process very little attention was paid to health by the European Commission or by the national governments whose goal was to meet the legal requirements for EU membership. He noted that healthcare is not the same as health status and health infrastructure is more than just healthcare. The goal is to invest in health in ways that will maximise positive impact on health outcomes. The EIB is increasing funds in the new Member States to tackle the unintended consequences of accession, particularly on socio-economic inequalities and ill-health. Results of the vote The session used several different mechanisms to enhance participation. All delegates received a voting slip with three statements where they were asked to record on a 1-5 scale their agreement or disagreement, on the reverse side they were invited to complete the sentence \"What I want to see from the EU in health policy is .... .\" . A total of 108 voting slips were returned, seventy of which suggestions for EU policy priorities. Each participant was also issued with green and red cards to be used for impromptu votes to assess the level of agreement among the audience. European Public Health Alliance Final Report 5 european public health alliance a.i.s.b.l. 39-41 rue d'Arlon B-1000 Brussels Belgium. 2 233 3880 Email epha@epha.org Website http://www.epha.org The results of the vote showed a high level of consensus among the session participants: The EU should focus on the basic challenges facing European societies : over 90% strongly agreed or agreed The EU should focus on ways it could have the most impact on individual health : 70% agreed or strongly agreed and 18% expressed no opinion Information should be the key focus of the EU health strategy : over 80% strongly agreed or agreed. The comments made by participants were summarised under 5 key headings that were picked up in the afternoon debate: Governance and powers of the EU: standards, quality, transparency, mainstreaming across all EU policies, consultation, funding, international role of the EU. Evidence-based approaches , information and data collection, exchange of good practice, the role of science, health professionals. Determinants and settings: health promotion initiatives in workplaces and schools, gender issues, tackling the 'causes of causes' of ill health, ine qualities, a physical and socio-economic environment that contributes towards good health. Rights : citizen and patient's rights especially in terms of access, quality, treatment and information. The role of Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM) in individual health and choices. Recommendations for EU action The panellists and audience engaged in a lively debate with informal votes being taken to indicate the general agreement with the points being made. Strongly support was shown for the following: EU action can act as a catalyst for action at national level -e.g; comparable data can reveal gaps and information about what works can be adapted. Independent evaluators of earlier health programmes called the Public Health Programme a 'critical mass of initiatives' but criticised the fact that the results are largely with the scientific community and are not grounded in wider civil societ y. Continuity is needed in terms of approach and funding, e.g; many projects set up networks or databases - but who maintains them after the project finishes? Public health is about long term change - with a timeframe for results of 15-20 years. It means investing in community engagement and individual empowerment and support. Health information campaigns are not the solution. Citizens have high expectations from Europe and on health. Policies with a real impact on people's lives must get priority. There are concerns about the unequal match between the health community's efforts to increase the uptake of in formation about healthy lifestyles and the financial power of commercial industries to advertise and market their products. The workshop voted to mandate the Commission to regulate to curb advertising - particularly aimed at children - as a matter of urgency. Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM) is a fast growing health sector across Europe. This raises issues of equity, access, safety and efficacy. The workshop voted that the European Commission should address CAM issues in its policy work. Finally, there was an unanimous vote in favour of an Open Health Forum in 2006. European Public Health Alliance Final Report 6 european public health alliance a.i.s.b.l. 39-41 rue d'Arlon B-1000 Brussels Belgium. 2 233 3880 Email epha@epha.org Website http://www.epha.org Report on Parallel Session 2: Health products, pharmaceuticals and medical technology Chair : Mr Vittorio Silano, Ministry of Health, Italy Rapporteur : Mr Dirk Broeckx, Pharmaceutical Group of the European Union (PGEU) Overview of the debate The first speaker from the European Commission's Directorate-General for Enterprise (DG Enterprise) highlighted the key changes resulting from the 2004 review of EU pharmaceuticals legislation. These include a widened scope and improved flexibility of the centralised procedure, greater coordination in the mutual recognition procedure and strengthening of pharmacovigilance. A second presentation from DG Enterprise outlined the fast-evolving medical dev ices sector comprising a wide range of products from the simple to the technologically very comple x. The Medical Devices Directive presented no real problems, but there are inconsistencies in its implementation at Member State level. The review of the Directive is an opportunity to update definitions, clarify requirements and increase transparency; the issues relating to the reprocessing of \"single use\" devices will be addressed separately. A representative of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) explained that their Roadmap to 2010 was aimed at improving patient safety, not least by a more proactive approach to post- marketing surveillance. The \"real-life\" post-marketing situation is a complex challenge. New medicines are exposed to a large number of patients, often taking several medicines. The Eudravigilance Database is a valuable resource and an important instrument for collecting information for effective monitoring. The EMEA is working on a strategy to make sure that the right information is communicated effectively by using a coordinated media strategy. The first issue for panel discussion was the value of new products and what constituted real innovation. The benefit of medical technology innovation, in the field of hip replacement and defibrillators, for example, was obvious. The importanc e of improving the EU environment for science based-industries was underlined. Innovation was defined as abroad conc ept; a suggestion that innovation could only be defined as something that produced the same results at lower cost, was also made. Cost is an important factor but true innovation could be a medicine that is more efficacious, has fewer side effects or is in a dose format that considerably improves adherence. On the other hand modest innovation at high cost was not considered acceptable. Health Technology Assessment (HTA) was referred to as an important instrument to address this challenge. Cooperation between national authorities was therefore an important resource. The point was made that there is an urgent need for an explicit recognition by policy-makers that good health stimulates economic activity. This long-term benefit should be taken into account when setting annual healthcare budgets. The second issue was whether enough is being done on post-marketing surveillance. There was a consensus that more must be done to motivate health professionals to report Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) and to highlight this as a professional res ponsibility. One possible solution could be \"no fault\" reporting. Experience showed that direct reporting by patients' should not be underestimated as a helpful instrument to receive early \"signals\". The importance of providing health professionals with relevant and independent information on post marketing surveillance data, was also raised. Information for patients was the third topic. Patient s have to be recognised as partners in decisions on treatment if improved therapeutic outcomes are to be achieved. Accessible, accurate, objective and understandable information is vital in this regard, especially for elderly patients. Public and patient dependence on websites that are often unreliable or inaccurate was identified as an issue to be tackled. The EMEA, patient support groups and health professionals have important roles to play in European Public Health Alliance Final Report 7 european public health alliance a.i.s.b.l. 39-41 rue d'Arlon B-1000 Brussels Belgium. 2 233 3880 Email epha@epha.org Website http://www.epha.org advising patients about reliable sources of information including reliable websites. Manufacturers were also referred to because they know more about their products than any other party. Focusing on therapeutic areas rather than on individual products and pre-moderation of the information by independent experts, including communication exper ts and authorities was suggested as an option to achieve this. Results of the vote Voting took place before the afternoon session, a total of 40 votes were cast. 45% were \"undecided\" on whether the EU Regulatory Framework rewards real innovation, while 30% disagreed 80% agreed or strongly agreed that the EU should encourage Member States to share HTA methodologies and results, while 15% had no opinion. 62% of the voting participants agreed or strongly agreed that the new EU regulatory framework will ensure more effective pharmacovigilance, only 10% disagreed. 85% agreed or strongly agreed that \"More effort should be made to improve reporting in both primary and secondary care \" and 10% had no opinion. 80% agreed or strongly agreed that \"The EU should ensure that information to patients on prescription-only medicines and medical technology is not of a promotional nature \", 12 % had no opinion. 75% agreed or strongly agreed that \" The provision of objective, accurate and understandable information to patients on health, therapies and medicines should be seen as a key priority for national and European Institutions in implementing their health policy \", while 10% disagreed. Recommendations for EU action Although there was not enough time for an in-depth debate on the wide range of issues raised in the session, there appeared to be a consensus on the following points: - Dialogue between stakeholders and regulators is important to address outstanding issues in pharmaceuticals and medical technology - Coordination at EU level to share methodologies and results of health technology assessments would provide important benefits - Under-reporting of Adverse Drug Reactions by health professionals should be vigorously addressed in a constructive and motivational manner. - Regulatory bodies for medicines and medical devices should make every effort to ensure that health professionals are in a position to provide reassur ance and advice to patients when information that may cause public concern is released. - A collaborative approach among all parties, including manufacturers, should be adopted to meet the challenge of better information to patients on medicines and medical devices. - Experts including communication experts and authorities should make sure that information on medicines is understandable, objective, accurate and up to date. - The EMEA should inform and advise on reliable inform ation sources, including appropriate websites for obtaining accurate, objective information.

She argued access to health care is nowadays considered as a fundamental right in Europe and that health care systems in t he Member States have developed for the well-being of people based upon principles of solidarity, inclusion, quality, and access for all. She noted also that health is a booming market, representing around 10% of employment in Europe. She argued that because of these two key factors health services are special and need carefully crafted and balanced EU level legislation - a balance which is not present in the current draft Directive on Services in the Internal Market. Ms Annette Kennedy, president of the European Federation of Nurses (EFN) continued to explore the special nature of health services by explaining that quality in health is a complex issue which involves doing the right things to the right people in the right way at the right time using the right people in the right place every time and doing the right things even better the next time. Ms Rita Baeten, European Social Observatory, then chall enged the delegates to think about the positive and negative aspects of European integration of health markets. Returning to the arguments introduced by Ms van Lancker she argued that the time is right for carefully planned integration which is sensitive to the huge structural differences that are derived from the culture and history of health systems Following the opening speakers, a further four short interventions were made on selected topics before the floor was opened to debate. Dr Grewin of the Standing Committee of European Doctors (CPME) argued that Europe has a key role to play in ensuring a safe environment for health services, Mr David Price (Edinburgh University) argued that health is a unique type of good and healthcare a unique type of service, while Ms Nicoline Tamsma (RIVM) urged t he audience to consider the wider issues of equal access to health services for all in society and argued for the judicious use of the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) to address social inequalities in health. MEP, Ms Zuzanna Roithova (Czech Republic), presented a more market oriented view of health in internal market looking in particular at the role of patient choice. A lively debate ensued from which the following points have been distilled. Many respondents felt that sustainable heath sy stems in the EU required co-operation between Member States involving all levels of government, civil society and professionals. Furthermore the exchange of good practice was seen as vital, with much support for a strong position on health in the Open Method of Coordination. It was also argued that while the subsidiarity principle was important in health it should not blind people to what can be achieved by co-operation at an EU-level. A number of people indicated the need for rigorous and ex tensive academic research into issues such as efficiency, effectiveness and. Other aspects to be reviewed are the impact of demographic changes on health services and systems and exploring the strong interlinkages between healthcare and public health . European Public Health Alliance Final Report 9 european public health alliance a.i.s.b.l. 39-41 rue d'Arlon B-1000 Brussels Belgium. 2 233 3880 Email epha@epha.org Website http://www.epha.org Results of the vote Participants were asked to record on a 1-5 scale their agreement or disagreement with two statements shown below. The results were as follows: The Member States alone can ensure an accessible and sustainable health system in each Member State. More than half (55%) of the respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed with this statement, 37 % agreed or strongly agreed and seven percent expressed not opinion either way. The EU has a responsibility to ensure safe and high quality healthcare systems throughout Europe. A large majority (72%) agreed or strongly agreed with this statement, 11 % neither agreed or disagreed and 16 % did not agree. The result of the vote would suggest that a consensus that the EU has a positive role in supporting Member State efforts to ensure accessibility and sustainability of their healthcare systems. This conclusion is supported by the second poll, which registered the strong message that the EU has responsibility to ensure safety and quality in healthcare systems throughout the Union. In addition to voting on the key statements, participants were also invited to complete the following sentences with their opinions or suggestions: 'Sustainable health systems in the EU require ... ' 'Safe and high quality healthcare systems throughout the EU require ... ' Recommendations for EU action The written comments and the oral debate that followed revealed the following key points: Involvement of patients and civil society with all stages of policy and strategy development, implementation and monitoring is key requirement of sound health policy at EU level. The focus on access and equity in healthcare must not become the 'cinderellas' of the EU health strategy Strong and fully implemented safeguards of patient safety are needed at EU level whilst respecting for the capacity of national rules guaranteeing quality and safety An internet portal to be established for the free exchange of data, evidence and practice to foster continuous learning and innovation. Finally, the rapporteur noted that the debate had raised much anxiety about the inclusion of health services in the current draft directive on Services and called on the Commission to address the potential of targeted healthcare services legislation, because subsidiarity is not a sufficient guarantee of meeting the promise of universal access to high quality healthcare.

They provide an overview of the key EU policy framework on specific issues and offer an opportunity for conference delegates to participate actively in debate. Session structure The Open Health Forum brings together a large num ber of participants and the sessions are designed to meet the needs and interests of the range of people that will attend the event. Participants are invited to choose which session they want to attend based on the brief overview in the following pages. All three sessions will use the same methodology and similar formats. The sessions are divided into two distinct sections, a morning section from 11.30 - 13.00 and an afternoon section from 14.30 - 16.00. Participants at the Open Health Forum are able to attend the morning section of a session where they want to learn more about an issue and select the afternoon section according to the topics on which they would like to contribute to the debate. The focus of the morning section will primarily be a factual overview of the key EU legislative or policy initiatives on the theme of the session. This will allow participants to get up to date with the latest developments at EU level. The afternoon section will be interactive and allow more in-depth debate and discussion of the topics. The debate will be facilitated and will focus on 2-3 questions that will be highlighted by short statements from a panel by speakers with differing viewpoints. All participants will have an opportunity to ' vote ' dur ing the sessions on the key statements that are put forward for in each sessions. The audience will be asked to vote on a scale of 1-5 (strongly agree to strongly disagree) on their agreement with the statements. The results of the informal votes which will be used as a basis for the debate in the afternoon section. Report to plenary The essence of the session discussions will be reported back to the Plenary and will also be published in the report of the Open Health Forum. The session rapporteurs will share the results of the informal voting processes on the key statements and any subsequent changes in position following the debate. European Public Health Alliance Final Report 11 european public health alliance a.i.s.b.l. 39-41 rue d'Arlon B-1000 Brussels Belgium. 2 233 3880 Email epha@epha.org Website http://www.epha.org Session 1: Health Strategy Objective Public health first appeared as an explicit policy area in the EU Treaty in 1992. In the past decade there have been significant milestones in the development of health policy at EU level. The creation of a Commissioner and DG for health and consumer policy (DG SANCO) in 1999 was followed by the adoption of the Public Health Programme in 2002. A public consultation in 2004 on a proposed EU health strategy elicited several hundred responses, many of which were integrated into a proposal for a new Health and Consumer protection programme for 2007-2013. The aim of this workshop will be to gather a range of views on what should be the key building blocks of an EU Health Strategy which is expected to be published in 2006. Section 1 Speakers from the European Commission, Parliament and Member States will be asked to set out their views on what is the appropriate role for the EU in health policy . Although most European countries face similar health challenges such as demographic change, rising levels of chronic disease and healthcare costs, significant health inequalities, there is no consensus on what added value the EU has to play in helping to tackle these issues. The growing threat of an influenza pandemic is an obvious and practical example of how the EU and national authorities need to work together to protect human health. Section 2 The debate will explore how much consensus can be created to build a shared vision of the European role in health . The European Commission has already a number of initiatives in place or planned on key heath determinants such as tobacco, alcohol consumption, mental health, food and nutrition, combatting HIV/AIDS. The discussion will look at how these could fit into an EU Health Strategy. Panelists will provide opinions about whether the EU should focus on areas of greatest need, eg pan European threats and causes of ill health or on issues where there is the greatest potential impact, e.g; where economies of scale are critical. Steering Group The steering group for this Session consists of: the European Public Health Alliance (EPHA), Eurohealthnet, Mental Health Europe (MHE) with additional input from Europa Donna and the European Committee for Homeopathy (ECH). The interests and expertise of those Associations will be reflected in the speakers and will inform the debate that follows. European Public Health Alliance Final Report 12 european public health alliance a.i.s.b.l. 39-41 rue d'Arlon B-1000 Brussels Belgium. 2 233 3880 Email epha@epha.org Website http://www.epha.org Session 2: Pharmaceuticals and medical technology Objective The European Union plays a pivotal role in the regulatory framework for pharmaceuticals and medical technology. Public health and patient safety are two key aspects of the way that these products are regulated and used. In addition competitiveness and i nnovation are also important elements. However, there have been some recent examples of failure in the system; some products have caused harm and some have failed to deliver benefits. Balancing cost wi th availability of innovative products remains an important issue. The aim of this session is to answ er the provocative question of whether citizens can trust the system that regulates pharmaceutical s and medical technology products and what the EU could do to further enhance confidence in these sectors. The theme throughout the session will be how to balance the harm/benefit equation for pharmaceuticals and medical technology while retaining a competitive industry. Session 1 The first session will set out a broad overview of the EU regulatory framework including the key changes brought in by the Review of the EU pharmaceutical legislation (completed in 2004), and the planned ' New Approach' to regulating medical devices and technology. Reference will be made also to the \"New Industrial Strategy for the Pharmaceutical sector\" and other relevant policy and legislative initiatives. Institutional speakers will focus on patients, in particular the ways in which the regulatory framework ensures that both pharmaceuticals and m edical technology products reach the patients in a safe and effective manner. Session 2 The facilitated debate in the second session will look at the issue of new products and review how innovation and added value are measured and how effi cacy and safety are assessed. The question of tracking the safety of existing products and medicines will also be discussed through the pharmacogivilance and post-marketing surveillance systems. Finally the session will examine the importance of information as a key factor underpinning public trust. The debate will focus on how the EU can develop an information strategy that will ensure good quality, timely, objective, reliable and non-promotional information for health providers, health professionals and patients. Steering group The steering group for this session consists of: Pharmaceutical Group of the European Union (PGEU), Health Action International (HAI), European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), European Medical Technology Industry Asso ciation (EUCOMED), European Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers (GIRP). The interests and expertise of those Associations will be reflected in the speakers and will inform the debate that follows.

The aim of this session is to elucidate some of the issues underlying the anxiety about health services wi thin the internal market and to explore selected aspects in greater detail in order to stimulate a debate between the participants. Section 1 The first section will consist of three presentati ons by experts from health practice, academia, and politics which seek to set out the key issues of health services within the European Union's internal market. The first speaker will present an overview of social - and healthcare services in the context of the draft legislation on services in the internal market. Building on this background the following speakers will look in greater detail at the way in which the issues of care quality, patient safety and access to health services can be addressed in the European Union. The first section will close with the presentation by the facilitator of two statements which will question the extent to which Europe can ensure a safe health care system in the EU and the extent to which a greater choice of healthcare providers can improve healthcare across Europe. Section 2 Building on the votes of the audience in the first session, the second section will begin with short contributions from experts which will kick off the debate. The purpose of the debate is to tease out some of the thorny issues involved in opening an internal market to health services while at the same time ensuring that such services meet the highest standards of safety and quality and ensuring that all European citizens have equal access to such services. Following the debate the audience will be asked to revisit their previous votes. Steering group The steering group for this session consists of: EHMA (European Health Management Association), AGE (the European Older People's Platform), EFN (European Federation of Nurses Associations), CPME (Standing Committee of European Doctors), EPSU (European Public Services Union), EHTEL (European Health Telematics Association) and ESIP (European Social Insurance Platform). The interests and expertise of those Associations will be reflected in the speakers and will inform the debate that follows. european public health alliance a.i.s.b.l. 39-41 rue d'Arlon B-1000 Brussels Belgium. 2 233 3880 Email epha@epha.org Website http://www.epha.org Additional Comments from Parallel Session 3, \"Health Services\", Open Health Forum 2005, \"Health Challenges and Future Strategy\", 7-8 November 2005 Findings of the Session At the workshop, participants were asked to vote on two statements, and then to write their opinions on two others. Here we report on the findings. Results of the votes The result of the first vote would suggest that a clear majority of participants (55.5%) accorded a positive role to the EU in ensuring that each Member State had an accessible sustainable health system. This conclusion is supported by the second poll, which shows that the overwhelming majority (72%) saw the EU as having a responsibility to ensure safe and high quality healthcare systems throughout Europe. 1 The participants were then asked to complete the following two sentences by adding their own opinions. 'Sustainable health systems in the EU require ... ' 'Safe and high quality healthcare systems throughout the EU require ... ' Their comments are summarised below. Sustainable health systems in the EU require ... Many respondents felt that sustainable heath sy stems in the EU required co-operation between Member States, with one person asserting that 'a momentum of co-ordination at EU-level' was needed. Many people emphasised the need for co-operation to take place at many levels, with one suggesting that support from employers and politicians was key, and another asserting the need for the 'mobilisation of all levels of government (both national and regional) and of civil society'. The involvement of professional bodies such as the Standing Committee of Medical Doctors was also seen as important, and one person suggested 'establishing health priorities together with patients and politicians' and emphasised the impor tance of the 'participation of citizen's organisations in policy-making'. The exchange of good practice was seen as vital, and several people emphasised the need for the Open Method of Co-ordination. Nevertheless, many respondents recognised the subsidiarity principle that governs the EU's handling of healthcare (one argued that 'Cooperation is not identical to harmonisation'). The po int made by many was not that th e subsidiarity principle should be done away with (Member States should retain the right to decide how to organise their own health services), but that this principle should not blind people to what can be achieved by co-operation at an EU-level. This ties in with the session's votes in which 55.5% of the respondents disagreed that the Member States alone could ensure an accessible and sustainable health system in each Member State, and 72% agreed that the EU had a responsibility to ensure safe and high quality healthcare systems throughout Europe. Another theme prevalent in many responses was the need for high quality research into such issues as efficiency, effectiveness and inequalities. One response emphasised the need for evidence on the effects of demographic changes on health services and health systems, which actually ties in with several EU-level projects that are already underway (e.g. the Ageing, Health 1 It was hoped to conduct a second poll at the end of the session to see if opinions had altered, but unfortunately too few people responded to this second poll to make the results meaningful. european public health alliance a.i.s.b.l. 39-41 rue d'Arlon B-1000 Brussels Belgium. 233 3880 Email epha@epha.org Website and Determinants of Health Expenditure Project, 2004-06 ). This response suggested that there should be a focus on evidence-based health promotion and disease prevention. Again, co-operation has a large role to play within research, and one respondent emphasised the need to learn from one another. It stated that we should apply any 'learning to our own setting as the default response rather than rejection or procrastination due to the \"not invented here\" syndrome'. One response argued that sustainable health systems in Europe require 'giving this area a priority rather than considering it secondary to the economy. Sustainable healthcare is key to economic growth - healthy citizens produce more and consume more'. This response also argued that sustainable health systems in Europe require 'B alancing economic considerations and tools with the fundamental right to healthcare'. The former theme also prevailed in many other responses, and one person asserted that it needed to be better recognised that the 'health system has an important economic impact on public health'. Another prevalent theme was the need for good gov ernance of health insurance systems, and one response requested a 'Definition of a basic package of healthcare services that should be given freely to the population'. One response stated that sustainable health systems in the EU require 'open access for all' and 'respect for patient rights'. It is surprising that these points were not made by more people, although it is possible that many overlooked 'the obvious' (though highly important) when making their own points. In any case, this should not undermine their validity. Equally valid is the point made by one person t hat 'If the EU is concerned about 'insidious' diseases (i.e. lifestyle issues), then it must prio ritise maternity services and midwifery services. A person's health starts (is influenced, shaped by) preconception, and a person's health is affected for life by breastfeeding'. Another stated that 'A national debate in each Member State is needed over what price the population is prepared to pay to have access to high quality, safe and efficient healthcare'. This is an interesting point since finance is a major (though not the sole) determinant of the quality of healthcare that a Member State can provide, and many of the suggestions made above would require money to carry out. However, one should be aware that a supposedly national debate could still see certain vested interests dominate the discussions. Safe and high quality healthcare systems throughout the EU require ... Many respondents emphasised the need to ensure the quality of the medical professionals who provide care. One respondent asserted, 'Given t he stronger mobility of healthcare professionals, excellence in the provision of se rvices is now more germane than ever before. To ensure patient safety and European citizens' protection extensiv e training of health professionals and high standards for the provision of services are a must'. Another asserted the importance of the continuous training of healthcare professionals. Sufficient core personnel and reasonable working hours for healthcare professionals were also emphasised. One person argued for 'Better long-term planning that sees workforce capacity as an asset rather than a disposable product. Retention of expertise needs to be a priority for action'. Another argued for a clear and transparent system of accreditation of healthcare providers. The need for the EU to establish minimum safety standards was seen as equally important. One response suggested that binding European guidelines on 'standards of care, diagnosis and treatment' were necessary. Another argued for 'C ommon European platforms to issue, update and monitor ethics, patient and human rights, and standards'. Another still suggested 'Setting high minimum standards such as defining a maximum time for waiting lists, a maximum ratio of patients to doctor, and a reasonable accessible price for healthcare (according to GNP per capita)'. One european public health alliance a.i.s.b.l. 39-41 rue d'Arlon B-1000 Brussels Belgium. 2 233 Website http://www.epha.org respondent argued for 'A centralised European quality system with a centralised agency and inspectorate'. They saw this as a method in its own right of stimulating national quality systems. However, the EU establishing rules was only seen as half of the story and many people argued that the important point was the sharing of best practices across Member States, which involved the commitment, both political and financial, of Member States, particularly for gathering the data. Many responses argued for an internet portal to be established 'for the free exchange of data, evidence and practice to foster continuous learni ng and innovation'. Important features such as exchange of information on healthcare professionals that have been banned from working and communicable diseases. Another common point was the need for the 'involvement of patients and civil society with all stages of policy and strategy development, implem entation and monitoring'. Similarly, one person argued that there needed to be a 'Removal of barriers and jargon for organisations to better participate in discussion at EU-level'. Another suggested that the information given to patients needed to be tailor-made towards their individual needs. One respondent argued that frontline workers as well as academics need to be involved in decision-making. Another suggested that there needed to be 'Respect for national rules guaranteeing quality and safety rather than their removal on the basis of EU market rules'. This person also saw the financial commitment of all governments as paramount. Of course, many of these suggestions may take considerable time, money and effort to implement (even though work is underway on many of them al ready). This in no way undermines their validity, but here is one comment which, whether one agrees with it or not, suggests a practical way forward: 'As a first step the EU should work as a think-tank and give advice to Member States and regional governments on how healthcare systems can be made sustainable'. One person wrote that 'Safe and high quality healthcare systems throughout the EU require the European Commission to stop seeing healthcare se rvices as \"just another service\"'. This is presumably a reference to the proposed Directive on Services in the Internal Market and the new Directive on the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications , both of which include health services in with other economic services an d appear to show little regard for their unique requirements concerning quality and safety. Section 4: Evaluation 1Open Health Forum 2005 -Health Challenges and Future Strategy 7/8 November 2005, Brussels 1 Evaluation Introduction The second Open Health Forum for health stakeholders was organised by the European Commission together with health NGOs on 7 and 8 November 2005 in Brussels. The conference at tracted some 370 participants from regional, national and European organisations as well as from th e European Institutions. They represented the main partners for health in Europe, in cluding policy makers, industries, patients, health professionals or academia. The conference is highly appreciated by hea lth stakeholders who demand to hold the Open Health Forum on a regular basis. Th e format of organisation will be reviewed taking into account lessons learnt from the previous two events. An online evaluation form was sent to partic ipants of the conference. The results are presented below. They give indications of what was done well and what areas for improvement there are for the next Open Health Forum. We would like to thank all those who took tim e to complete the form and shared their views on how to improve the Open Forum in the future. Summary The evaluation is based on the online evalua tion forms returned by 93 participants out of approximately 370 participants (25.1 %) as well as informal comments by participants during th e conference. In general, the second Open Health Forum was considered as a success. It was rated bett er than the first Open Health Forum and improvements were noted by participants. Th e majority of respondents answered all questions concerning the quality of the event with \"good\" or \"very good\". The detailed ratings for the qu estions are given below. O RGANISATIONAL ASPECTS The practical arrangements for the Open Health Forum 2005 such as invitation, practical info rmation, registration and we lcome were rated by 89.2 % of those returning the evaluati on form as \"good\" or \"very good\". The documentation available at the confer ence was rated by 77.4 % as \"good\" or \"very and by 2.2% as \"poor\". 77.2 % found the online registration and website \"good\" or \"very good\". The social aspects , such as opportunities for networking and catering were rated as \"good\" or \"very good\" by 71.7 % of those answer ing the question. The overall theme and the issues covered in the Open Health Forum 2005 were rated as \"good\" or \"very good\" by 69.9 %; 23.7 % found them \"average\" and 6.4 % \"poor\". 1 Please note that this evaluation summarises the participants' answers to the online questionnaire on the Open Health Forum 2005. The summary reflects the opinions and suggestions by participants. They should not be understood as those of the Commission. 2PLENARY 58 % of the respondents rated the plenary session as \"good\" or \"very good\". 34.4 % 2.2% \"very poor\". 71.3 % thought that the EU has a major impact on people's health , 28.7 % did not agree. Reasons for a positiv e answer were the \"impact of EU legislation and EU coordination and information\". Reasons for a negative answer were \"Principle of subsidiarity and insufficient EU health strategy and communication\". While 89.8 % of the respondents stated that the EU should have a greater role in the future , 10.2 % disagreed. Reasons for a yes vote were the added value the EU could provide as well as consid erations of solidarity and the EU's social system. The principle of subsidiarity was stated as the main reason among those who replied with \"no\". Asked what action the EU should undertake if it could only conduct one action the following areas were mentioned: o Prevention - health promotion o Empowerment - information o Ensure mainstreaming of health in other policies o Diseases, Research, Funding o Health care - health care systems - health services o Provide added value for Member States - best practices o Health professionals o Demographic change o Complementary and alternative medicines PARALLEL SESSIONS Parallel session 1 \"Development of the EU Health Strategy\" turned out to be the most popular parallel session. Amongst those participating in the evaluation, 44.1 % attended the mo rning and afternoon session of parallel session 1 . Of those who participated 76.3 % found session 1 \"good\" or \"very good\". 14 % of those who replied participated in the morning and afternoon session of parallel session 2 \"Health products: Phar maceuticals good\". In parallel session 3 \"Health Services\" 25.8 % of respondents participated in the morning and afternoon session. 82.7 % found the session \"good\" or \"very good\". The overall value of the Open Forum was estimated to be \"good\" by 56.5 % and \"very good\" by 23.9 % of those re turning the evaluation form and \"average\" by 17.4 %. On the other hand only 2.2 % though it was \"poor\". SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT Participants were also as ked to give suggestions for improvement. One aspect in particular, raised in severa l evaluations, is to provide \" fewer speeches, more discussion including in sma ller groups and time for questions \". The programme was considered as too packed and parallel sessions as too big . A possible solution proposed was to have four parallel sessions. 3 It was positively noted that NGOs had been involved in the preparations . It was proposed to ensure a better involv ement of health care workers. Also it was suggested to review the invitation and registration process and to be more open regarding who can participate. Not always the same participants and speakers should be invited who represent only a specific sectoral interest or sometimes only themselves. POTENTIAL SUBJECTS FOR THE NEXT OPEN HEALTH FORUM FUTURE EVENTS The majority of respondents spoke in favour of holding the Open Health Forum on a regular basis. Evaluators suggested a large variety of topics, ranging from patient rights to health professionals, diseases, preven tion, ageing, health systems, health products, health inequalities , and health in other polic ies. A detailed list of suggestions is given below. 4Detailed answers 1.

Referring to the plenary's discussion theme do you think the EU has a major impact on people's health? Yes 71.3 % 62 No 28.7 % 25 Total 100 % 87 Why yes? Impact of EU legislation / regulation / actions - Due to legislation and agreements on tobacco, agriculture, environment, transport, safety at work, marketi ng, free movement of patients and other important policies which affect health. Members States are obliged to transpose European into national legislation - EU programmes: Public Health Pr ogramme, research, cohesion funds - Definition and setting of safety and hea lth standards for e.g. health products, pharmaceuticals, toys, food, tobacco products and many other consumer products. This influence on citizens' health is definitely a positive contribution - EU mandate in the Treaty to protect health of people living in Europe EU coordination / information - Cross-cutting issues that affect health of all Eu ropeans: tobacco, alcohol, nutrition, obesity, cross-border healthcare, patients' mobility - Promotion of healthy life-styles, e.g. Help campaign, obesity platform - Free movement of patients, leveraging the level of EU health services - Raising awareness at political level, however, the economic interests of industry dominate, citizens are not involved - Exchange of good practices, platform for discussions, EU can guideline Member States, help to develop better st rategies to enhance overall health and well-being - Coordination of preventive measures, support of quality-improving initiatives - EU can redirect the consequences of globalisation in order to maintain and develop living conditions favourable to health Why no? Subsidiarity / Member State - EU competence - Subsidiarity, national health systems are the main players, Member States are too individualistic - very different level and po ssibilities of healthcare - no EU competence, EU can intervene onl y indirectly, but growing ways in which EU can and will have impact in the future 6Insufficient EU health strategy / communication - EU does not know the citizens' daily conc erns, it is too far away from the citizen - Citizens do not know what the EU is doing (positive exception: Help campaign) - EU should have impact but it currentl y lacks the resources to implement - EU lacks a clear strategy and long- term objectives to implement the programmes and address the various issues ; e.g. what objectives do we want to achieve in nutrition, by when and how, what actions shall we take, what legislative proposals woul d take this forward? - EU and IMF oblige recent Member States to spend less on social welfare. EU should do more to control privatisat ion of healthcare systems in these countries - EU's focus has been more on free trade 8. Should the EU have a grea ter role in the future? Yes 89.8 % 79 No 10.2 % 9 Total 100 % 88 Why yes? Added value - Significant added value in area of pa ndemics and emergency situations - European dimension needed to eliminate inefficiencies and to provide a better cost-benefit ratio in the case of hea lthcare, promote good practices, EU as unifying force - EU has capacity to mobilise expertise and resources which Member States do not have, especially small ones and which allow to act efficiently with regard to principal health determinants; health determinants are very similar in the Member States, therefore a common, c oncerted approach is advantageous, Member States cannot address some health challenges on their own - Mobility: mobility of health professi onals threatens public health, some hospitals close on certain days because they do not have enough staff - enhance cooperation between Member States in the area of services - ensure safety of products - more needs to be done on indoor air, improving the quality of healthcare received by people with allergic a nd respiratory diseases, enable their representation and make funding availa ble for research on these matters EU's social system / Solidarity - Health is an important part of the EU's human capital - Equality and solidarity: EU should regul ate more on equality purposes while taking into account nationa l specificities, promote more solidarity, Greater chance of achieving equality of access to best quality health services, EU can foster transparency and efficiency in the healthcare system, ensure access of everybody, some Member States do not fu lly recognise some basic rights - ensure consistency/equality/solidarity and high standards of health policies 7- EU should do more about ethic and pr ices in the area of pharmaceutical industry - improve environment and achieving improvements in income Why no? Subsidiarity - not in the direct future, the EU shoul d set minimal standards and frameworks, local and national policy can vary within this framework, the historical and cultural differences of Member States need to be respected, over the years sustainable welfare can be developed a nd EU policy can be more generalised - no, this is national and individual responsibility - to have more influence shoul d not be a goal in itself, if a greate r role is needed to achieve certain health goals, then the EU should have a greater role - depends on what areas, no greater role w ith regard to healthcare investment planning 9. If the EU could undertake only one action on health what should it be and why? Prevention - health promotion - focus on prevention, it has the potent ial to have the greatest impact - invest more in prevention, prev ention is better than cure - unify health prevention programmes - invest in preparedness against epidemics, control and cooperation in case of pandemics - develop health promotion policy based on the Ottawa chart - promote health promotion programmes and actions - Anti-smoking: make smoking illegal in a ll public places in all Member States, harmonise duties - Alcohol strategy: prevent children from harm made by alcohol; age limits, stronger restrictions on comm ercials, harmonise duties - fight drugs - AIDS: common awareness raising cam paign on HIV/AIDS in all 25 MS including equal access to treatment - Improve screening in early age, joint actions Empowerment - information - social dialogue: promote participati on in policy making both nationally and internationally, ensure more participation of citizen s and health professional and less food and pharmaceutical industry - create an EU wide online tool with information for patients and citizens, description of disease symptoms, availability and quality of care (where to go in the EU for optimal treatment), ri sk/benefit of treatments, prevention, innovations, real cost of treatment, reimbursement levels, types of health insurance available; website should be build and updated with help of all 8stakeholders in healthcare, it should o ffer a forum for discussion and exchange of experience, available in all EU languages - make people aware of their rights, hi ghlight disparities between level of service and prices across the member states - Labelling/Product information: protect citizens from suggestive and unclear product information - closer contacts with health profe ssionals and teache rs who are better connected with people than public ins titutions and NGOs which are active in only special fields Ensure mainstreaming of health in other policies Diseases - rare diseases, activities cannot be perfo rmed satisfactorily at national level - mental health, neglected in several member states Research: - find treatment of major diseases - facilitate the creation of networks of excellence - more funding Health care - health care systems - health services - ensure equal access - patient mobility - availability of medical servic es in other member states - ethics and prices in the ar ea of pharmaceutical industry - exempt health services from services directive - harmonise high standards in health care provision - ensure minimum quality levels for healthcare providers/services in order to promote free movement of health services Provide added value for member states - best practice - action where Member States cannot act al one, area that is visible to citizens - share problems and solutions - ensure well-functioning European health systems by ensuring necessary adaptations of national systems - work together with Member States; indus try and professional bodies to realise citizen centred services Pharmacovigilence Health professionals: - ensure free movement of professionals - workforce planning of health care professionals - tackle the practice of medicine - Data protection and regulations for health professionals in e-health Demographic change - invest in better demographic development - fight abuse of elderly people 9Funding - ensure sufficient funding - spend 1 Euro per person per year on health by 2013 Promote and establish CAM as complement of equal value 10.

Patient rights - Patient rights - Patient safety - Patient mobility - The informed patient - Information about EU activitie s in the field of health - Citizens' and health professionals' participation - Family and children's health - Security, rights and obligations of ho me carers (family members caring for ill or handicapped people) Health professionals - professional mobility - invest in health care workers - application of competition laws to health professionals Diseases - dread diseases - development of disorders - orphan diseases - chronic diseases Prevention - alcohol - tobacco - stop aids - fight cancer - stop drugs - using evidence for policy decisions and why we do not stick to it Ageing - health and ageing population - elderly (long term) care - care of elderly with multiple diseases Health systems - Health information systems management - Impact of new technologies in health care evolutions with regard to patient mobility - E-health - Open method of coordination 11- Reforms of the member states - avoid duplication at national and EU level - Comparison between the different health care systems: f unding mechanisms, governance of healthca re institutions Health products - Market of medicines - Common techniques for hea lth technology assessment - Transformation to a demand-led market - Medicines advertising - how to make the best choice Health inequalities - Addressing and reducing health inequalities Health determinants Health in other policies / Coherence of EU policies - health promotion and in tersectoral approach - effect of non-health EU policy on th e health protection of EU citizens - health impact assessment - particularly as regards other elements of EU policy - Role of agricultural policy - Environment and health - Status of national legislation on tobacco Other - Solidarity in health - CAM - Opening of regulation of differe nt kinds of medical practices - Promoting the EU health capital 13. How would you like to improve the organ isation, social and other aspects? Organisational aspects - No alcohol during lunch - More vegetarian and hea lthy food, too limited catering - No need for a conference bag - Stands in the ground floor di d not receive as much at tention as on other floor - Better registration, more transparent that first on invitation basis only - Better interconnection with other health conferences Content - no reference to CAM - plenary session and general topics mos tly covered from economical point of view which is too narrow - more attention needed on social securi ty aspect when discussing health and health care systems - NGOs should continue to be involved in the preparations as the concept of letting NGO's and other stakeholders r un sessions proved to be very good - Better involvement in the preparations of health care workers (10 % of Europe's working population work in h ealth care sector (7 % in hospitals) 12- Less speeches, more question time and interaction, more audience participation, more structural discussi ons; more discussion in smaller groups Format - too many (broad) subjects covered, p acked programme, no new conclusions or insights - too many and sometimes too long pres entations in plenary and parallel sessions, panel could be smaller and have a more courageous debate - suggestion to only have one speech and then more time for discussions, questions and comments - more time for smaller parallel sessions, increase number of parallel sessions - make the event more outcome-driven: What do we want to achieve by attending such a meeting? Do we want to draft a charter of health that all actors would follow? Do we want to poi nt out areas where we can mainstream health and how do we do that? Do we want to strengthen the European Commission's role? What are the objectives and what is the outcome? Secondly, the topics discussed were too general. Attending organisations are usually aware of those issues and ma y want to have a more challenging debate, a less politically-correct plen ary session. The Open Health Forum could be place where taboos are left outside the room and where the Commissioner can speak frankly to the health community; or where some more technical aspects could be addressed by the health community. - EC representatives should participat e during the whole event and not leave after their presentations, this would prove that the opinions of participants are considered important - Inclusion of DG Employment and Social Affairs for Open Method of Coordination - Better formalisation of the participants' input; how do they in reality influence policy making - Internet forum for discussion Participation - Too much influence from NGOs, public health specialists from MS and health deliverers should have had a better presen ce as well as \"ord inary\" citizens in order to avoid over represen tation of specific lobbies - Health professionals should be heard, too, give more room to practitioner specialists, member states do not nece ssarily always speak for professional specialists - It seems that always the same people are invited who only represent their specific sectoral interests and sometimes only themselves - Most participants consid ered the conference an excellent opportunity to network, while some found the oppor tunities to network limited - not an exercise in active consultation - impression that passive participants to legitimise decisions already taken 14. What further comments, suggestions, etc. do you have? - hold the Open Health Forum on a biannual basis - more communication before and after the events in connection with member state organisations, media and public services 13- make the Open Health Forum truly ope n as regards part icipation. Health Policy Forum members would like to send open invitations to all of their member organisations. The selection of participants should be on a \"first come, first serve\" basis, with a reservati on of quotas for diffe rent target groups - More presence of mid-level or regi onal officials and professionals who actually \"run policies\" - involve more citizens including from lower social levels, citizen/patient empowerment (cf. G10) - cut down the amount of topics covered or extend the conference to two full days minimum - Health care should get a better pl ace in the politic al mainstream - Pharmaceutical industry should not be i nvited as their commercial interests should not influence health strategy.

OPENING OF THE CONFERENCE Section 5: Remarks by Mr Robert Madelin B RINGING HEALTH POLICY CLOSER TO CITIZENS : CHALLENGES AND FUTURE STRATEGY Remarks by Robert Madelin Director General for Health and Consumer Protection European Commission Open Health Forum Brussels, 8 November 2005 1 Introduction I would like to repeat the welcome that I ga ve yesterday evening, especially for those who were not able to be with us for what proved to be an interesting networking event. I am sure we all agree that Health policy has to respond to the needs and concerns of individual citizens of the European Union. That's why we are here today. The challenge, as viewed by a Brussels-bas ed policy-maker, is how do we feed the concerns of individual European citizens into such a big thing as European Union health policy? How can the Commission an d your organisations work together to develop policies that will m eet citizens' expectations? So today the objective is to identify the ch allenges facing citizens in their quest for health and what future polic y we need. First, I would like to share some thoughts with you on EU health challenges and the n eed for more governance in health policy. I will then say a few words on citizens' pa rticipation, on health systems and health products which are, together w ith health strategy, the themes of the parallel sessions we want to run in the course of today. 1. EU Health Challenges Let me pick up a few of the health challenges as we see them. First, and this is even clearer in a Union of 25 than it was before May last year, there is a huge health gap in population health and in access to healthcare services across the Union. Citizens from some of the new Member Stat es are expected to live 12 years fewer than a citizen from a Nordic Member Stat e. The mortality rate for ischaemic heart diseases shows an eight fold variation across the Union. Many regions lack high- quality centres of reference with up-to-da te equipment and trained staff for some prominent health challenges in their regions. This health gap goes hand in hand with an economic gap. Bad health impacts on productivity, on labour participation and on growth. This is why we in DG SANCO - and I think it is fair to say, the Barroso College - encourage Member States to 2position health as a long term investment. We try to do that by providing the data, the studies, and to help to channel more clearly the Structural Funds to health projects in eligible countries and regions. The second major challenge is the increase in lifestyle related diseases . It is a real increase. It is not just that the infecti ous diseases' burden has gone away and we suddenly notice lifestyle . Lifestyle related diseases ar e growing rapidly as a threat. Overweight and obesity affects 14 million EU children and their number is rising by almost half a million a year. Unsurprisingly, therefore, type 2 diabetes is also increasing. Addressing lifestyle problems - not just nut rition or the lack of exercise, but also smoking or alcohol abuse - will require acti on from a wide range of stakeholders. We launched an anti-tobacco campaign to help young people to resist or to quit smoking. We have also created this year a Europ ean platform on nutrition and physical activity to encourage concrete ac tion by all our partners to promote healthy eating. A third challenge is the health budget problem. Pressure on health budgets has increased steadily over the past few years, partly because the new technologies and high-quality healthcare that all national hea lth systems need to provide cost more, but also because the message that \"health equals wealth\" has not got across to the Treasuries of Europe; has not got across to the macro-economists; has not got across to the Heads of State or Government. Addressing these challenges re quires us to contribute both on the demand and on the supply side to find more co st-efficient use of technology; to improve quality without always throwing more money at quality issu es; to promote health more actively in order to reduce healthcare demand; and to co -operate between health systems so that we can share the load, for example by centr es of reference co -operation. In these areas, I think that in the last couple of years, in th e light of the reflection process launched under David Byrne's leadership, we are beginning to see a willingness of Member States to work together not to ha ve a European policy, but to create common approaches to dealing with these common problems. The fourth challenge I would identify is ageing. I received an e-mail from Washington overnight asking: \"Who is in charge of ageing in the European 3Commission?\" Well, quite a lot of people s hould be taking an interest. Again, because Treasury views seem to dominate, ageing is primarily seen as a pension issue or a workforce issue and therefore it is my colleagues in DG Employment and their partners around Europe who are perhaps th e most best known discussants of the ageing issue. But ageing is a major challenge for health and feeds back again through the health aspect into th e future prospects for the European economy and for European society. We expect, as you know, that ov er the next quarter of a century, the number of people aged 65 and over will increase by 37% and th e number of people over 80 will more than double. We therefore need to have a much more active policy to address the health maintenance needs of this burge oning section of soci ety, so that people don't just live longer, but have healthy life years. And that is another reason why it is not just life expectancy but \"H ealthy Life Years\" that we have adopted with the European Council as a key performance indicator for the Lisbon process. Those are the four major challenges we see for the future. I think what we need to know is whethe r you agree; whether your major challenges and core business can be found under those four pillars or whether there is something that we would miss if we try to build the European movement for health, the European strategy for health, around those four key drivers. 2. The case for better governance and the new strategy Let me talk a little about governance. I ha ve already talked a bout governance by complaining that macro-economists and tr easury officials failed to grasp the importance of health policy. Of course, th at is not because those individuals are necessarily opposed to health; it is because somehow the way we run our society fails to give then the data and the incentives to realise the truth that probably all in this room realise. According to a recent survey (which we run through the so-called Eurobarometer system of EU public opinion po lls), half of our citizens think that the European Union could usefully play a greater role in health matters in the coming years. But, at the same time, citizens are worried that they do not get to participate in policy-making. 4More than half of them believe that if a deci sion is taken at EU level, their voice does not count. You have the paradox that on th e one hand people like Europe when it works, but on the other hand, they do not think it does work and so they vote against it in referenda. Knowing that health is a primary concer n for citizens, we feel that the public consultations we have carried out around our health strategy show two key things: firstly, they would expect Europe to inte grate a strong role on health alongside the strong role on economics, but secondly, they want to be sure that they have a guaranteed say in decisions that affect their health. Right now the Commission is encouraging a wide public debate on the future of the EU. I think that the debate is particul arly important when it comes to health. I hope therefore that when you go home after this conference, one of the things that you will take the time to say is firstly that you've been to Brussels to talk about health (because most people do not know that this sort of discussion takes place); and secondly that what we have been discussing today is an important part of the debate about re-launching Europe. Too often, I think we as citizens leave the fu ture of Europe to Foreign Ministers and Prime Ministers and similarly important people, and then we wonder why our concerns as citizens are not reflected in a ny vision for the future of Europe. The one thing leads to the other. I would very much urge you to take away from this conference the fact that Europe can do th ings which will be good for health, but only if we in the health community go home and work for that to happen. And that brings me to the point about part icipative policy which I made last night. You cannot make health in Brussels for half a billion citizens. You cannot make health in one town for 25 Member St ates and goodness knows how many regions. We therefore need to think very carefully about how to bring all the citizens of Europe closer to a European debate about health, while at the same time recognising that whatever we can do within the Union is onl y a complement to national and regional health policies. 5And within those national and regional health policies, each Member State has its own different ways of setting priorities, feedi ng citizens' concerns into policy-making, and organising health services. So what do we intend to do? We intend to try to work more closely with citizens' elected representatives, not just in the European Parliament but with national Parliaments. We intend to use the so-called \"Plan D\", Vice-President Wallstr\u00f6m's dialogue plan to re spond to the failed referenda, and to use it as one of the platforms for a much broader, more grass roots debate on health as one theme. But in addition to working with central governments and national legislators, we need to find new ways of i nvolving the regions and civil society. Organisations such as the ones you represen t therefore have a key role in voicing and advocating the concerns of citizens. We n eed your advice not just on what should the content of the strategy be - are our four p illars the right ones? - but also on how can we set about structuring the discussion, structuring the proc ess in such a way that the individuals who are represen ted by your organisations wi ll notice that people in Brussels are trying to listen to them. It is one thing for us to feel that we are trying to listen, but real democracy only happens wh en people around Europe notice that we are trying to listen to them. A nd that is really difficult. We are not starting from scratch. Here we ha ve the Health Policy Forum, we have the recommendations of that Forum on issues su ch as health and enlargement; and that Forum plays an important role not just working with DG SANCO but helping to integrate health in other policies such as research. We also want to use the part icipation of NGOs in policy-ma king and that's part of the Health and Consumer programme we proposed this spring. We need more money for that, so we continue to ar gue for the financial perspec tives being discussed in the remainder of this year to double or more than double the modest funds available for health within the overall European budget. I must say I am not optimistic. But I would also say that budget making is like any other aspect of democracy. So I hope that your organisations are writing to your national counterpart government representati ves and to your MEPs to say that you think, as an organisation, that let us say \"a euro per citizen by 2013 for health\" would 6be a good idea. If we fail to get that, and you have not written, you will only have yourselves to blame. Certainly we in DG SANCO continue to fight hard for it in season and out of season. I say to everybody I can contact here in Brussels that a euro per citizen for health is not too much to plan for by the end of the 7 year period for which the budget is now being set. So if you think that this is a reasonabl e request, please write to those who can take the decision. The question is how do we us e that money, or less money if that's what we get, in order to support your advocacy work? I said la st night and I said th is morning that we want your organisations to be active not onl y in regions and the Member States but right across Europe. How can we support you effectively? Is it a question of better information on health status and policies? If that is the case, then I would encourage you to look at the presentation st and outside the room about our new health portal, which is designe d to provide user-friendly information on health in 20 languages. Can we do anything else to foster the cap acity of non-governmental organisations or to foster not just your capac ity internally but your ability to network with each other? These are the questions that I think are crucial in terms of governance. 3. Health systems Let me now come finally to health systems and health products. On health systems, the parallel session is going to look at th e scope for fostering co-operation and exchange of best practice between health systems without harmonising national and regional approaches whether on policy or on clinical practice. I believe, as a newcomer to this field eighteen months ago, that the new appetite for this sort of \"soft co-ordination\" is re latively high amongst national Ministries. What is lacking is the ability of those who indulge in such co-ordination in national Ministries, who are often in international departments, to reach out to those who are actually running policy at national and regional level and to reach out beyond administrative structures to those in your or ganisations who also have an interest. I think there is a discussion which is beginni ng, but at the moment the participation in that discussion is too narrow. 7Thinking about this from a citizens' perspectiv e, I would say that in the health systems field there are questions that your organisations could be asking in the health systems co-operation debate, to see whether it has something in it for you. Maybe three questions: Firstly, if you have a healthcare need which is not met in the hospital down the road, do you know where you would go? Secondly, if you were to need healthcare ab road, would you find the same level of quality and safety? What would it take to gi ve you a feeling of co mfort equivalent to that you feel in the hospital next door (which I hope is a good hosp ital), if you went to a hospital 500 or a 1000 kilometres away across one or more national borders? And finally, how do you feel about issues of redress? Are they important? Do you feel, when you go to a hospital or into the health system, \"I am confident because I have redress and so if I go to a foreign count ry I might not have redress?\" Or is that not such an important issue? All these challenges - under the headings of patient rights, quality and safety, patient safety - are issues which are currently on the agenda among the Member States in the High le vel group that I chair . We are beginning to discuss them, there is an appetite to discuss them, and we ar e looking to get more input from your organisations to drive that pa rt of our policy-making forward. 4. Health products Then on health products, and this is my last point, it is clear that products, whether it is medicines or medical t echnology, are crucial; that they are a major field of innovation; and that Europe is a leading innovator, amongs t others, in this field. The question is for citizens and patients: Do you get the inform ation that you need? Are you happy with the channels whereby Eu ropean health culture provides you that information? The parallel session we will be organising on health products will therefore be discussing a set of important relevant issu es there: the need for medicines to be available; safety concerns related to ne w pharmaceuticals; and the cost-effectiveness issue - how to get better European level health technology assessment. 8I think the link to those issues is also the one about patient information: Have we got the balance between professionalisation of information flows and general background education right in Europe or not? That is a very old and long running debate in Europe, but it is not one that has gone away. All those issues will be on the table in th at parallel session and then we will come back to the plenary here. Conclusion Let me conclude. The fact that there are so many questions demonstrates the need for this sort of Forum not just to be a day of intensive disc ussion, but to be the sort of focal point where at regular intervals this community comes together and takes away a series of questions to struct ure the work we are doing t ogether over the years ahead. We think that this is a particularly crucial moment. It is crucial for several reasons. First, the budget is being set for the next seven years. If the UK Presidency is successful, it will be set by Christmas and there will be no further questions about how much money is available until 2013. That is important. Second, because we are talking about budget we are also talking about strategy and we are doing it at a time when the failure of referenda in certain countries in Europe creates an opportunity - an opportunity to re-position health within the panoply of public policy issues. That opportunity is reinforced by the European Council's decision this year to make Healthy Life Years a performa nce indicator in the Lisbon process. So far this is a little noticed i nnovation, it may not even have been noticed by all the Heads of State and G overnment, as they took the d ecision in the Spring. It is up to us to make it real. For those reasons, I think this is the right time to have this meeting. Indeed I hope this is the right meeting. You will tell us at the end if it has met your objectives. I am certainly very pleased to have such good par ticipation and I hope to be able to listen to some of the panel discussion. Thank you very much.

La Commission actuelle and future strategy: does Europe matter?\" Section 7: Presentation by Ms Imogen Sharp Section 8: Presentation by Prof. Martin McKee 1Health and the economy Presentation by Martin McKee Thank you for inviting me to speak at this forum. Like the other panellists, I was given a list of questions on the general theme \"Does Europe matter?\". One of them asked whether the EU should take action in the health sector to improve health or was health determined by other factors, such as macroeconomic trends. As is often the case, it is actually m ore useful to reframe the question. As I hope to show, this is not an \"either/or\" question. Both are true, but together they are only part of the story. I want to begin by reviewing some work that we have recently completed that looks at the relationship between health and the economy. This was a project under taken by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, t he European Regional Office of WHO, and the Centre for European Policy Studies here in Brussels, with funding from DG Sanco. Our starting point was a very important report published in 2001 by the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health. That report was looking at the situation in developing countries. It showed that, at least in poor countries, good health was an esse ntial determinant of economic growth and conversely that bad heal th was a significant brake on economic and social development. This work has been highly influential, providing the intelle ctual underpinning for contemporary policies on international development assistance. Unfortunately we cannot simply assume that the si tuation in developing countries can be applied to high income coun tries. Countries such as those in the EU differ in two important respects. 2First, while in developing c ountries the predominant disease burden is attributable to communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal conditions and nutritional deficiencies, in developed countries the greatest burden is at tributable to non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, injuries and mental health problems. T he Commission on Macroeconomics and Health was able to identify certai n basic interventions to address the diseases that predominate in developing countries, such as bed nets to prevent malaria. Ho wever the threats to health in Europe, however, are substantially more complex. In particular, they require multifaceted intersec toral policies to prevent them from arising and integrated multi-disciplinary management strategies to treat them. Second, production techniques in high-income countries have particular features. Agriculture an d primary extraction are less important within the economy. Technological progress has meant that manual labour has become a less important factor in generating output than in developing countries. The importance of manual labour in the overall econom y is likely to influence the ways in which ill health impacts upon labour market outcomes. In our report we were able to bring together in one place a wealth of evidence that is normally sca ttered among many different places to look at the contribution of heal th to the economy in high-income countries. This encompasses cost -of-illness studies; the impact of health at the individual and household level; the macroeconomic impact of health, the economic value of better health and the impact of the health system on the economy. 3We began from a simple theoretical framework in which health could contribute to economic outcomes in high-income countries through four main channels: hi gher productivity, higher labour supply, improved skills as a result of greater education and training, and increased savings available for investment in physical and intellectual capital. So what did we find? We were able to show that a signifi cant amount of evidence exists to support the economic importance of health in the labour market in rich countries. We found that health matters for a number of economic outcomes: wages, earnings, the amount of hours worked, labour force participation, early retirement and the labour supply of those giving care to ill household members. In addition we reviewed the comparatively scar ce evidence from high income countries on the effect of health on education and on savings. There was compelling evidence that poor health negatively affects wages and earnings. The magnitude of the impact obviously differs across studies and direct comparabilit y of results among countries is limited. However the over all effect was clear. We were also able to demonstrat e the existence of an extensive empirical literature, mainly from the USA but more recently also from Europe, showing that health increases the probability of participating in the labour force. In the same way we could show a significant and robust role for ill heal th in anticipating the decision to retire from the labour force. A gain, the relationship has been more extensively researched in the USA than in Europe. However, these findings raise important questions that we don't have time to go into now about the impact of differences in institutional 4frameworks, such as pe nsion rules, availability of disability benefits and occupational insurance arrangements. Ill health matters not only for the performance in t he labour market of the individual directly concerned but also for that of their family members who, in turn, will often ha ve to adjust their labour market behaviour. We showed that, in general, men appeared to reduce their own labour supply by substantial amounts if their wives became ill but women were more likely to work if their husbands became ill. Obviously this can pa rtly be explained by the unequal distribution of gender roles within the family and the different situation of men and women in the labour market. We also looked at the impact of health at the macroeconomic level. We were able to show that historical studies that had explored the role of health in part icular countries over the past one or two centuries have confirmed th at much of today's economic wealth is directly attributable to past achievements in health. We already know that health \u2014 typically measured as life expectancy or adult mortality \u2014 is a very robust and sizeable predictor of subsequent economic growth in virtually all studies that have explored this issue in poor count ries. However, researchers have focused less on the specific role of health in economic growth in high-income countries, and in the few cases in which this was done, health was not always found to be positively related to economic growth. We suspected that this was due in part to the use of health indicators that imperfectly capture the existing health differences between high-income countries. We were able to confirm this by showing how, if cardiovascular mortality is used as a measure of ill health, health is a significant predictor of 5subsequent economic growth in hi gh-income countries, but not in low- and middle-income countries. It is widely accepted that GDP is an imperfect measure of social welfare. It is simply the sum of monetary transactions in the economy and as a result it fails to incorporate non-market goods, such as the value of health. T he true purpose of economic activity is the maximisation of social welfare, and not necessarily the production of goods by themselves . Since health is an important component of properly defined social welfare, measuring the economic cost of ill health only in terms of foregone GDP leaves out a potentially major part of its 'full income' impact, which we can define as its impact on social we lfare. We undertook an innovative analysis that placed a monetary va lue on the years of life gained in EU countries in the past decade, both in total and those additional years that can be attributed to the contribution of health care. This showed that Europe has achieved major gains in full income, and moreover that when we compared investment in health care with the economic gains associated with the increases in years lived, in many countries there was at leas t a two-fold return on investment. Finally, while there is a direct effect of health on the economy, there is also an impact of the health system on the economy irrespective of the ways in which the health system affects health. The health sector 'matters' in economic terms simply because of its size. As one of the largest service industries, it represents one of the most important sectors in developed economies. Currently its output accounts for about 7 % of GDP in the EU-15, larger than the 5 % accounted for by the financi al services sector or the retail trade sector. And around 9 % of all workers in the EU-25 are 6employed in the health and social work sector. Through its sheer accounting effect, trends in product ivity and efficiency in the health sector will have a large impact on these performance measures in economies as a whole. Moreover , the performance of the health sector will affect the competitiv eness of the overall economy via its effect on labour costs, labour market flexibility and the allocation of resources at the macroeconomic level. In our study we were able to revie w an extensive body of evidence on the link from health to the economy. We have shown that investment in the health of the people of Europe will be an important means to enhance the ec onomy of Europe. However, we did not look at the other side of the equation, because it is already so well understood. This is the link from the economy to health. There is an enormous body of res earch showing that economic growth is good for health, at least as long as the economic gains are distributed in an equitable manner, as has largely been the case in Europe. Obviously the sit uation is very different in the USA, as we have seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. So what does this mean for European policy? We have been able to show, on both theoretical and empirical; grounds, that the European welfare state can be good for economic growth. The challenge is to create policies th at will support the development of a virtuous circle in which investments in the health of Europe's citizens lead to improved economic performance which in turn lead to better health and so on. Inve stment in policies that promote health must therefore be at the heart of the Lisbon Agenda. In the time available, I can't go into the detail of what must be done. Obviously we need policies at all levels, and in many sectors. We 7need action by local and regional governments, by national governments, and by the European Union. Where action takes place depends on what needs to be done. For example, decisions about traffic calming measures are best taken by local government but action to ban tobacco adverti sing, because of its cross border nature, is best taken by the European Union. However, to return to the original question \"Does Europe ma tter?\", no-one, I think, would argue with the contention that European policies matter for economic growth and as a consequence, the European institutions have a legitimate role in intervening to support this aim. What I have tried to show is that, in pursuit of economic growth they have a powerful justification for int ervening to promote health. I also believe that, even if this was not the case, we could still legitimately ask our representativ es to take actions that would promote the health of the citizens of Europe anyway, but that is something that I am sure ot hers will want to address.

Section 10: Presentation by Mr Derek Rutherford 1 Open Forum Brussels 7 -8 November 2005 Derek Rutherford Asking the question \"Does Eu rope matter?' will elicit differing responses, for the EU means different things to different people. Those, like myself, whose childhood and youth were fashioned and influenc ed by the immediate post war period of the mid forties and fifties, could clearly appreciate and accept the vision of the foundi ng fathers \"to keep the peace of Europe\". Over the past 50 years we have moved on . We have a different generation of Euro peans whose life experiences are different from that of the founding fathers. Ask \"Why Europe?\" in the new Member States, generations brought up in a totally different political environment, often respond, \"t o maintain our security and protection\". 2 The economic success of Europea n membership is often the common answer among people from member states that have experienced gr owth in their GDP' s and standard of living. However, in older member states, opinions reflected in referenda or public opinion polls revea l that the average person in the street is dis connected with Europe, viewing it as irrelevant or meddlesome. For many, Europe ha s become the playing field of political and commercial elites. How then do we get our fe llow citizens \"to embrace\" Europe, to give to them a sense of ownership or partnership? For a new genera tion we need to challenge them with the global worl d - its social and political realities. A world where, the largest economies in the future, are forecast to be China, India and, of course, the United States. To meet such a challenge we need a healthy Europe and a healthy workforce. In remarks to a Nuffield Trus t and EPC meeting last year, Robert Madelin felt that \"the overriding priority for the Commission had to be to put the individual back in touch 3 with Europe\" and went on to sa y \"a field that affected all, such as health policy, might ju st be the way to achieve such a connection\". When posing such a view, I wond er if the Director General had in mind Benjamin Disrae li's observation: (one of the eminent British Prime Ministers of the 19 th century). \"The first consideration of a Minister should be the health of the people\". He strongly objected to thos e who felt improvements in the social and work conditions of the people would undermine economic prosperity. Disraeli would have applauded Madelin's view: \"Health has to be seen as an economic factor in the Union: healthy life years are a factor in competitiveness\". From its outset, fifteen ye ars ago, Eurocare's Charter emphasised that: \"the EU can no longer rema in solely an economic union, it must beco me a social community where 4 the collective health intere st takes precedence over individual economic interests.\" A major challenge for the publ ic health community will be to succeed in ensuring th at the drive towards less regulation, reducing red tape for business and competitiveness does not come at the expense of public health concerns. The factor that changed the attitude of the British Trade Union Movement from being anti to pro EC was the European Social Mode l. A Model, which they felt was losing ground with the then economic decisions of the United Kingdom Government. Public trust in NGO's is far, far higher than that in politicians and commercial concern s. This factor makes us well placed to persua de public opinion to the relevance of Europe. Provided (and there is an important caveat) that European institutions ensure a level playing field for our voice in the shaping of polic y. The example set by DG SANCO is good, but it would be helpful if other Commission Directorates followed suit. 5 The European Alcohol Polic y Network developed by EUROCARE is a good example of the importance of the EU in social and health policy. All member states, candidate and associate countr ies are represented covering NGO's, Public Health Authorities and academia. It would do well for EU institu tions to comply with Treaty obligations. The treaties maintain th at the Union should: \"Contribute to the attainment of a high level of health protection\" and that \"Health protection requirements shall form a constituent part of the Community's other policies\" Thus the Treaty recognises th e impact that EU Council and Commission policies can have on health. But how far is the principle executed? Have sufficient resources been allocated in order to assess such decisions and their health implications? It is worth noting that in the debate on excise duty in the nineties, the European Commiss ion accepted the principle that taxes on alcohol had a pu blic health dimension. 6 In the 1993 White Paper on \"G rowth, Competitiveness and Employment\" it stated: 'An increase of excise du ty on tobacco and alcohol provides a source of additional budget revenu e and a means of preventing widespread social problems, and can help social security budgets to make savings by reducing the need to treat cancer and alcoholism'. Having been asked to select on e area in health that the EU should prioritise, it would have to be one of the five key health issues that the DG consi ders needs tackling. It would be a lifestyle related social and health problem that also impacts on health inequalities. The one I have selected causes in the EU: 4 out of every 10 homicides - 2,000 per year Over 1 in 6 suicides - 10,000 per year 1 in 3 road traffic deaths 17,000 per year 10,000 of which are estimated to happen to 'innocent' victims - 200,000 Unprotected sex incidents among 15- 16 year olds 7 1 in 7 Child abuse/neglect cases After tobacco and high blood pressure it is the third highest risk factoring mortality and morbidity - Alcohol costs an estimat ed \u20ac125 billion annually, almost half due to lost productivity. It contributes to health inequalities both between and within countries. Alcohol plays a considerable role in the lowered life expectancy in the EU 10 compared with the EU15. If it were any other subst ance, other than alcohol, there would certainly be demands for governmental action. However, with alcohol we are dealing with not just an irresistible pleasure but massive vested interest. In 1979 a British Government Minister speaking to the AGM of the National Counc il on Alcoholism (of which at that time I was the Director) said that alcohol was a lifestyle problem and that dealing with lifestyle problems demanded 'not incision at the surgeon's table but decision at the cabinet table.' 8 The drinks industry responded very quickly to this perceived threat. Critical of what they considered to be the late and inadequate re sponse of the tobacco industry to similar threats, they were determined to set the research agenda. The voice of the public health lobby had to be countered, but, if possible, also wooed. There is no escaping the fact that there is a conflict of interest between the industry and public health. It should come as no surprise that we face an alcohol epidemic throughout Europe. An epidemic to which public health authorities have been alerted through the WHO European Alcohol Action Plan; Two WHO Ministerial Health Conferences - the last one advising that \"Public Health Polic ies concerning alcohol need to be formulated by Public Health Interests, without interference from Commercial Interests\" 9 Why does the industry have such a hold on governments when polls of civil society give them such a poor rating? Why do we have inaction on policy relating to advertising when, where polling has been carried out, the public w ant positive action to curtail volume and content. At least the European Parliament saw the need for action over alcopops. The Council of Ministers has issued recommendations on alcohol consumption by young people and called for an EU strategy. It is in the process of being formulated by DG Sanco. Why address children and young people? Because it is the children who pay the pr ice of the last round! Much is said about passive smoking, little recognition is given to the third party victims of alcohol. Up to nine million children of the EU will return from school today to a home with a parental drinking problem. 29% of young males between the ages of 18 to 29 will die 10 from an alcohol related c ause - the major cause of death for young people in the EU. The EU is concerned about human rights. The rights of the child should have high importance. One of the five ethical principles of the WHO in relation to alcohol is: All children and adolescents have the right to grow up in an environment prot ected from the negative consequences of alcohol c onsumption and, to the extent possible, from the promotion of alcoholic beverages. While awaiting the DG SANCO alcohol strategy, we can embrace and publicise the newly adopted WHO Alcohol Policy Framework. But above all else let us remember: If we take care of the children of Europe, Europe will take care of itself. Section 11: Presentation by Mr Aidan O'Shea 1EUROPEAN COMMISSION OPEN FORUM 2005-HEALTH CHALLENGES AND FUTURE STRATEGY. Brussels, 7-8 November 2005. PRESENTATION BY AIDAN O'SHEA, COMMUNITY PHARMACIST, BLACKPOOL, CORK, IRELAND. Email: aosp@eircom.net FOUR QUESTIONS ARE POSED TODAY. 1. DOES EUROPE MATTER? 2. WHAT HAS THE EU DONE FOR PEOPLE'S HEALTH? 3. SHOULD THE EU DO SO METHING IN HEALTH? 4. WHAT ONE AREA SHOULD THE EU PRIORITISE? The intent of today's meeting is to make progress in a complex process. That process is to make practical links between the common health objectives of The European Union a nd its 25 constituent member states on the one hand and the well-being and h ealth of the individual citizen on the other. DOES EUROPE MATTER? How do our citizens perceive the EU; as a distant monolith in Brussels or as a benign second guarantor of their welfare and civil rights? Low turnout in the most recent Europ ean Parliament elections and the subsequent rejection of the propos ed European Union Constitution by citizens of France and Th e Netherlands suggest at least a sense of individual detachment, and at most a re sistance to greater integration of policy and governance at EU level. In recent years the EU has embraced 10 new member states in central and southern Europe, while simultaneous ly facing faltering economic growth and intense global competition. These ra dical changes in the scale of the EU and fears about globalisation a nd unemployment have made many of Europe's politicians and c itizens more defensive. Let us be aware of these realitie s without being oppressed by them. Should we, as a broadly representative group, whose role is to design and deliver better health to our citizen s across the EU, be deterred by the current gloom about the European project? 2 Therefore we must work together to ease health ine qualities between EU member states, not neglecting the significant inequalities prevailing for some groups of citizens within states . I have in mind particularly the needs of older citizens, of those with chronic physical and mental illnesses and the needs of recent immigrants. These groups have the greatest health needs and often ha ve the least economic and political leverage of power. Policymakers must listen closely to the NGOs which speak for these groups. Health professi onals too must act as advocates for the most needy and vulnerable. In my everyday pharmacy work, much time is spent helping such patients not just with their medication, but with problems of access and deliver y of essential services. WHAT HAS THE EU DONE FOR PEOPLE'S HEALTH? In order to appreciate what EU direc tives have done for the health of the individual, we must take a compre hensive view, taking account of broad parameters such as these: The quality of the air that we breathe, The purity of the water in our rivers and seas, The safety of our food supply, our homes and our workplaces and The prevailing peace among the member states. At the specific level of licensi ng and monitoring pharmaceutical products, the EU operates throu gh an independent agency EMEA which ensures the safety and efficacy of medicines licensed throughout the Union. This system also ensures prompt access to new and effective treatments. This is just a summary of how the EU contributes to our individual well- being. Broad environmental factors lik e these have a fundamental effect on maintaining health and preventing disease. Let us not take them for granted, nor fail to extend their remit wh en appropriate. Their effect is at least as important as the benefits of an accessible modern health service. Today's debate also dr aws attention to consumers. In my opinion, consumers and citizens are synonymous when we talk about health. It is I think not, because the cornerstone of our EU mutuality is that the sum of our wisdom and experience is great er than its individual parts, that Europe at its core has a heart whic h values the weak as well as the strong. We citizens are not mere c ogs in a giant economic wheel. 3evident that verified information and health education empowers the individual Towards healthier lifestyle choices, Towards a better understanding of acute and chronic disease and Towards coping with the challenges of ageing. In cases of illness, that need, that hunger for information and support, extends from the patient to the family. Many times a day in the pharmacy, we respond to health queries based on unfounded scare stories or wildly exaggerated claims about new and unorthodox treatments. Health information today is much more democratic, particularly since the explosive growth of the Internet. Yet how do we evaluate the content a nd the truth of this information avalanche? It often falls to health professionals to act as honest brokers, so to speak, interpreting and gu iding patients towards realistic expectations and involvement in their treatment and recovery. SHOULD THE EU DO SOMETHING IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH? Having set the present scene, so to speak, where does the EU interact in the future in the field of health? Do ctors, nurses, phar macists and others working in primary care are aware that personal lif estyle impacts directly on many causes of serious disease in western society. I am speaking of such fundamentals as Inappropriate diet, Lack of physical exercise, Tobacco smoking and Alcohol abuse. The risks of developing obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease and smoking re lated cancers can be reduced by behavioural choices under individual control. So can this forum make a positive intervention in the areas I have mentioned? 4WHAT ONE AREA SHOULD THE EU PRIORITISE? To revert to my opening point, we are seeking practical EU initiatives which will assist in maintaining the h ealth of the individual. I can think of none more evident or salient than a ra nge of measures to prevent tobacco smoking, to assist smoking cessation and to protect the public from the proven damage caused by environm ental tobacco smoke (ETS). Such a plan would engage and contribu te to all of the headline objectives of this forum namely To protect citizens against health threats To promote healthier lifestyle policies To contribute to reducing the in cidence of major diseases and To contribute to developing more effective health systems. There is a growing momentum of c onsensus that now is the time to advance boldly in the matter of tobacco controls. This consensus is shared at the level of the citizen, at the le vel of national government and at the EU level. It is my experience that smokers want more help to quit and also want to enjoy a smoke free envir onment. Nicotine is their addiction, not smoke. Nicotine replacement produc ts have contributed greatly to helping the smoker to quit. A strict ban on smoking in enclosed work places was successfully introduced in Ireland in March 2004. Offices, shops, bars, restaurants, cinemas, theatres, public buildings and public transport are now all smoke-free. This has been a remarkab le feat of social engineering, transforming the culture of our leisur e and work environments. The level of compliance with th e ban exceeds 93%, and initial arguments about statism and interference in personal freedom have faded away. There is strong anecdotal evidence that sm okers have cut down or quit their tobacco consumption, and the overall prevalence of smoking in Ireland is now at a historic low of 23.6% (A ugust 2005). The success of this model has had a domino effect in other memb er states, and new regulations on ETS are in force or pending in Sco tland, Northern Ireland, England, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Informed consumer opinion and regulatory enforcement form a vital pa rt of this legislative and social change. 5 Just think; if it were asbestos or l ead in motor fuel, would we hesitate to ban it from our ambient air? Companion strategies such as education and quitting programmes are best pursued at member state level. We can decide to make today a day of des tiny in the health of the European citizen. The EU has the legal capacity to ban ETS using Hea lth and Safety Legislation. But is there sufficien t political will and determination to agree such a measure at EU level? The weight of evidence against smoking tobacco is overwhe lming. Today's meeting can be the catalyst to shed our timidity, to set aside our subsidiarity and to give our EU citizens a virtually smoke-free environment, permanently.

Problems with health are a recurring subject in the parliaments proceedings. Attention focuses on problems from obesity and cardiovascular diseases, to the increasing risk of pandemics caused by bacterias which are transmitted across borders and frontiers. Due to global reporting, we directly witness the threat of the avian flu bacteria affecting people all over the world. Almost every day the public is confronted with frightening pict ures of the results of such an outbreak because of intense m edia coverage. And yes, the possibility of people fa lling ill after being expo sed to these bacteria has also crossed o ur European borders. Earlier this morning you have di scussed the proposed EU health strategy. So, I will not summarize it - and limit myself to present my political views. I will conclude wi th the advice not to agree with the three statements. Not that I disa gree with every word of these statements. But it is my view that they simply do not add much to deliver a convincing health strateg y - and they hardly contribute to European Health. But let me start with two general political observations First: health is in the first plac e an issue for national governments. This is a reality that follows fr om the EU treaties - but even more so it is a political reality. A fter the No votes of France and The Netherlands there is a widespread feeling that Europe interferes too much in national practices. Hence the screening process of Commissioner Verheugen to delete unnec essary rules, directives and policies. There is a lot of resistance against the European Commission to dig into the details of national health systems or to interfere with national policies. We are not living in a Europe without policies. Second - and partly contradicting t he first point. Citizens do have high expectations of Europe. The EU should be involved in issues that really do matter to everyone. One of these matters is health. It follows that EU should involve it self in health questions - but it needs to focus on joining forces, on genuine cross border issues. And it should present an added value. And - as I will conclude: it is with this attitude that we indeed ca n arrive at a situation of health without borders. With these points in mind, I cannot help but think that the Health Strategy as formulated by the Commission is somewhat too abstract and too little fo cussed. It has some - or even many - good points but a clear focus is lacking. I outline five areas that deserve in my view priority. These areas are: research, best practices, healt h check in all policies, cross border challenges and in dustrial policies. But I have a demand that underlies a ll five items. That is: show leadership. Do not focus on EU- action programmes with too many aims, strategies with almost no money. There is hardly a citizen or patient that will benefit from these general activities. Show leadership, address member states, ci tizens, patients, hospitals, health care institutes, technology and industry. A ddress them with a program that makes health a tr ue priority. Show leadership and make health an issue across all DGs. Commissioner come out of DG sanco and spread the health message beyond DG Sanco. So, what are the 5 points that are important in my view? 1. The first is Research . Here the message is: join forces for Health research. There are many diseases still poorly understood, many diseases that lack adequat e treatment. Focus on Alzheimer rather then vague demographic chan ges that are mentioned in the statements. Focus on lung diseases, rheumatism, certain cancer types and so on. Take the 7th framework program as an opportunity to outline a research agenda. Use the money from FP7. And most important motivate - not force - member states to cooperate and get involved. Look across the Atlantic to the US and find out if a European Health inst itute with research programmes is a useful step. Look beyond FP7 and collect money from member states to engage the EU and the member states in a program to find answers to priority diseases. 2. Prioritize best pr actices over mobility : The EU, the parliament and not to forget the C ourt all have focussed on patient mobility. Of course I am entitled to have medical treatment when I need it during my stay in a f oreign country. And I need this treatment to be reimbursed by my insurance company. But this is quite a financial-technical matter. Just make it possible where there are still gaps today. However, there is no need to make this the cornerstone of EU health polic ies. I have read in a Commission document on patient mobility that pat ients suffering from cancer of the blatter in Austria have 80% chan ce to survive. In Poland only 40%. Instead of sending polish pat ients to Austria and making a case for mobility of patients, I strongly suggest that our politics should aim to provide all Polish patients with Austrian treatment methods. So each patient should ha ve the right to have the best therapy in his of her own count ry. Healthy treatments and best practices should cross borders, no t patients, who after all will prefer to have treatment in thei r hometown or at least home country. Therefore, I suggest to establish for each disease area a centre of reference which maintains a network of doctors and patients. For diabetes, lung disease, c ardio-vascular, different cancers, mental health and so on. Best knowlegde, best practices should be accesible to all doctors but also to patients. Use money from the FP7 to create and support these networks. 3. Introduce a health check . EU policies and rules should promote healthy living, healthy food, and healthy work. I suggest a health check in the screening proce ss. Take obesity for example: Globally there are more than 1 billion overweight adults and at least 300 million of them are obes e; the problem was a western problem - but is now flooding to China and other Asiatic countries. Obesity rates have raised three-fol d or more since 1980. Obesity and overweight pose a major risk for chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular di sease, hypertension and stroke, and certain forms of cancer. Ma lnutrition is a major cause of death. So, the least the EU should do is to stop subsidizing the production of unhealthy food. Subsidies shoul d be on healthy food like fruits and veget ables rather than on sug ar and butter. That would be commitment to health. Or: take labelling on food and recognize that consumers do not understand complex information on labels. Introduce a food quality star system that allows consumers to make a healthy choice and motivates industry to produce more healthy food. Or: take the case of smoking: s how commitment to health and stop subsidies on tobacco. Or: take air quality, think ab out the more than 350.000 early deaths each year and encourage instead of prevent member states to impose particle filters on diesel cars. In short: make a health che ck on all EU policies. Change or withdraw unhealthy policies! 4. Combat cross border communicable diseases . I can be short on this, because the intention is there. But I emphasize that the lessons from SARS and BSE should be learned. Act firmly. Be prepared. Make the Centre of Dis ease Control work efficiently. Make sure that member states are prepared, and t hat cooperation will not be hindered as a result of bad communication or logistical problems. 5. Activate industrial policy Europe has engaged itself in a Lisb on strategy. Take the Lisbon strategy seriously. If Europe want s to regain a leading economic position in the world it should invest. Invest in health. Global health, healthy products, health y production methods, e-health, healthy food and last but not least medicines that have a therapeutic added value. There will be an increasing demand for healthy products - so it will pay of f to invest in health. Use the Competition and Innovation Program to subsidize investments in more healthy products and net works. Remember that a good public health is an important asset, also in economic terms. Ladies and gentlemen, I arrive to my conclusion. There is a lot to gain from investing in health. There is a lot to do. Citizens, patients, doctors, and health care workers do expect a lot from the EU. So let us work together and deliver. Deliver a health program beyond the one of the Commission. We should not limit our ambition to the proposal of t he Commission. Let's move forward and focus on points that really deliver a added value to European's health Section 17: Presentation by Ms Paula Duarte Gaspar Section 18: Presentation by Mr Stephen Wright PARALLEL SESSION 2: \"Health products: Pharmaceuticals and medical technology\" Section 19: Presentation by Ms Claire Scharf-Kroener Section 20: Presentation by Mr John Brennan Section 21: Presentation by Dr Isabelle Moulon PARALLEL SESSION 3: \"Health services\" Section 22: Presentation by Ms Annette Kennedy Section 23: Presentation by Ms Rita Baeten Section 24: Presentation by Ms Nicoline Tamsma Are EU mechanisms for collabo ration good for equity of access? A contribution to the debate on health services at the Open EU Health Forum Brussels, 8 November 2005 Nicoline Tamsma, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment The Netherlands 1. Introduction The organisers of this session have as ked me to present some thorny issues involved in ensuring equal access to health services for all European citizens. They have also asked me to focus on the potential contribution of European cooperation through the 'open method of coordination' (or 'OMC 'in short). In doing so, I will draw on so me of the work Philip Berman and I have done on the OMC on poverty and social inclusion. 2. What can we say about equity of access to services? We do know inequity is a persistent feature across health systems in the EU. Services are not always equally available to people in equal need, nor can we say there is equity as regards service delivery or service utilisation. We also know that service need as su ch is not equally distributed among our population. Lower socio-economic status is associated with more chronic conditions, more disability and more unhealthy life years. I would like to keep this population group in mind in my reflection on access to services. Improving access is a broad challenge. Di stance, delay, waiting and costs are all dimensions that a ffect access. Some barriers to access may be more relevant to disadvantaged groups than others. For ex ample, car ownershi p and travel costs are factors that disproportionately affe ct people from lower socio-economic groups if people are to tackle a concre te access barrier such as geographical distance. 'Softer' factors such as health beliefs, and the ability to ex press one's needs and expectations should also be mentioned here, as should language barriers and cultural differences. At the same time, our modern health systems radiate towards the needs of assertive, well-infor med, internet-literat e health consumers. Thus, addressing these factors be comes more urgent than ever. Health systems finance may cause financial barriers of different height and shape to people in different income situations. Health care may be funded from a variety of sources, such as taxation, social and private insurance, or out-of-pocket payments. We know that out-of-pocket pa yments are relatively unfair to people with less income. Studies focusing on service utilisation show that richer, be tter educated people find their way to medical specialists and dentists more easily and more frequent compared to poorer, less educated people . On the other hand, people with less income tend to use more GP services an d more emergency services. The latter is especially worrying: late presentation of their health needs may have a negative impact on their prognosis. 3. So, how can EU mechanisms for collaboration help to improve access? When looking at the 'open method of coordination' there are two of these processes that specifically address access to health services. I would like to look at both of them. But first I would like to say something about the process itself . Subsidiarity is the starting point for every OMC. OMCs are designed to help member states tackle issues of common concern and learn from each other. This leads to sequential dialog ues between member states and the Commission. Based on this dialogue, the Co mmission identifies joint objectives and indicators relevant to these objectives, facilitates cross-national learning, and measures progress. The member states keep a rela tively strong focus on their domestic situation: on challenges at national level, on delivering joint objectives though their own national action plans (or 'NAPs'), and on what they want to learn from others. The democratic element seems to be lackin g in this process, but ... member states are expected to involve stakeholder orga nizations in developing their NAPs. I would like to stress that national and Euro pean stakeholders wanting to influence the OMC need to do some careful planning so they can feed into the right bit of the process at the right time. Whether or not an OMC will be good for health access depends on how well its key actors perform in this process. The Commission part is basically played by DG Employment and Social Affairs, not by DG SANCO. They are operating under the banner of social protection and build on experience with similar proce sses on themes like employment, social security and pensions, and poverty and soci al exclusion. While that may not be a bad preparation for addressing equity of a ccess to health services, health policy is a relatively new topic for them. As for the member states, one may ask whether they will openly share their problems or showcase their policies; and how keen they are to learn from others. Whether the ministry in charge of health has some experience with OMCs already due to earlier involvement in EU collaboration on employment or social security. Or whether they intend to collaborate with stakeholders, and which ones they choose to invite to the table. 4. So, what lessons can we learn from the OMC on poverty and social exclusion? Improving access to health and social serv ices is a priority for tackling poverty and social exclusion across th e EU. As such, it is part of the wider objective to improve access to public services. Based on our review of 5 NAPs, my impression is that member states do not pick up this challenge in any elaborate way. Ye s, citizens' legal entitlements to equal access to health care are commonly referre d to. The same is true for waiting list issues. But the broad range of barriers I discussed earlier -i ncluding service costs!- were addressed insuff iciently, or not at all. There is, however, much scope for improvement. This OMC is meant to improve the living and working conditions of people in disadvantaged situations. That makes it a very appropriate instrument to improve equity of access. Member states could be much more creative to address health access measures in their NAPs. NAPs could, for instance, include specific information on equity of access. They could include an analysis of health needs of disadvantaged groups and concrete measures to meet these needs. And they could include measures that counteract negative consequences of health systems finance for people living in poverty or people who are disproportionately affected by ill health . Allowing for a small range of specialist services for drug users or homeless people is not enough. Instead, efforts should incl ude a wide range of activities that are also aimed at improving mainstream acce ss and responsiveness. To achieve this, the health community may have to seek cl oser partnerships with social affairs ministries. 5. And what about the OMC on health and long-term care? This process is progressing slowly, very carefully, but steadily. It is still a long way to NAPs, but broad objectives have b een agreed. Together with experts from member states, the Commission is workin g on the identification of the most appropriate indicators. This element of the process is pivotal as the indicators selected are likely to influence or even steer future prioritisation. The good news is that ensuring access is one of the three ma in objectives of the OMC, along with ensuring quality and financial sustainability. The Commission has stated that access can only be labelled as 'adequate' if ability to pay is no obstacle to receiving care. This is, of co urse, good news as well. What also makes me hopeful is the list of issues the Commission would like to see mapped within and across member states. That list includ es unmet need, availability of services, population coverage, the burden of pr ivate spending, and waiting times per region. In spite of this, I also have some concerns . The first one has to do with ensuring a good balance between the three main objectives . Access should not become the ne w Cinderella of health policy, following after its sisters 'finance' and 'quality'. This challenge will be tough to meet as the EU has powerful competencies in the area of finance, and the origins of the whole process lie within pre ssures to contain public spending. Secondly, the focus is predominantl y on acute health services and- to a lesser extent- on residential care . Access to home care, to innovative forms of integrated services, to physical aids an d to 'intelligent' devices (to name but a few) should be addressed more prominentl y, as should issues with respect to mental health. Furthermore, we need to put more effort into developing the right access indicators , however difficult this may be. And we need member states to gather data on these indicators once they have been agreed. Last but not least, health ministries and stakeholder organisati ons need to get to grips with this process that comes at them from a non-health angle, and anticipate how it may help to improve access at national level. 6. In conclusion , both OMC processes provide a great opportunity to safeguard the social values and common principles underpinning healthcare systems in Europe. Equity of access is central to those values. The OMCs can also help member states to find a way out of the subsidiarity- dilemma that has been a feature in the EU health systems debate since Decker and Kohll. Both OMCs coul d generate good practices or even benchmarks that may feed into developments around health in the internal market. The impact of the OMC on access at nation al level will be much up to the member states themselves. Each country does face specific challenges with respect to the common objectives. The OMC does enable co untries to learn from each other and find solutions that match their national situation. To what extent they will indeed do so may depend on the efforts of thei r governments as well as their stakeholder organisations.
