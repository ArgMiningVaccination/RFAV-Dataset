There is nothing we can do about the virus but definitely something we can do about the host (ourselves). We can make our health stronger by boosting our immune system and enabling our bodies to better fight viruses and infections. Supplements can certainly help though they can be hard to find and expensive these days. Here are 5 simple habits you can start practicing today to get you strong and healthy. 1. SLEEP Sleep quantity and quality is important. Adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep, although sleep needs differ from one individual to another, the average number of hours is usually quite stable for any one person. Lack of sleep reduces our energy level and leads to a decrease in our body's T-cells and T-lymphocytes. These have the function of attacking foreign antigens (viruses and bacteria). Emotionally, our lack of sleep clouds our mood and reduces our ability to deal with life's difficulties, especially at this particular time of uncertainty. 2. EAT Enjoy whole foods and nutrient dense foods. A wide variety of colourful vegetables and fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds will ensure you all of the vitamins and minerals your body needs to function and perform at its best. Vegetables and fruits are high in important vitamins and minerals that support a healthy immune system such as vitamin A and C. Choose dark leafy greens (spinach, kale, collard greens...), bell peppers, vegetables in the cabbage family (cauliflower, broccoli, bok choy...), orange vegetables and fruit. Drinking plenty of liquids such as, water, warm water and herbal teas such as lemon water, ginger and turmeric tea is also important. Bone broth is an excellent gut protector, it is full of collagen and helps in gut repair. Find recipe [here](https://draxe.com/recipes/chicken-bone-broth-recipe/). Eat antimicrobial and antiviral foods such as garlic, onions, ginger and herbs and spices (oregano, thyme, turmeric, rosemary...). Protein: Proper protein intake is [essential ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17403271)to build and repair body tissue and fight viral and bacterial infection. Heads up to vegans and vegetarians here as your protein consumption may not be adequate during these trying times. Make sure you get 0.8-1 gram per kg of your body weight per day (i.e. if you weigh 60kg you would need about 60 grams of protein). For healthy protein options think legumes, nuts, seeds, lean meats (preferably organic), eggs, fish, organic tofu and tempeh. High protein foods are also generally high in zinc another very important mineral when it comes to immune healt Avoid Sugar and processed foods - People with diabetes are more at risk of dying from COVID-19. Sugar and high glycaemic foods suppress the immune system and feed the virus. This is a great opportunity to create new habits : ditch the sodas, fruit juices, cookies etc. and focus on foods that have a low glycaemic index (i.e. most whole foods). 3. GUT HEALTH Eat foods rich in pre and probiotics as approximately 80% of your immune cells live in your gut. Our vitamins and minerals are also absorbed in our small intestine and therefore in order to absorb them properly our microbiome needs to be healthy. Optimal immune function therefore means having a sufficient amount of good bacteria which we need to feed with the right foods. This means eating foods rich in: - Probiotics such as: miso, and - Prebiotics (fibre): vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes. If you are finishing a round of antibiotics or if you feel you are coming down with a cold you should be taking a high quality probiotic. Choose the kind that requires refrigeration and that contains a minimum of 30 billion colonies. 4. RELAX and Cultivate Hope Hope and fear cannot occupy the same space, invite one to stay.Maya Angelou Stress depletes our immune system and makes us more likely to succumb to viral infections. We also know that although certain factors make us more likely to become stressed, it is usually perception bound and we know that we can change our perceptions. A great tool to help us do this is mindfulness meditation. This is a perfect time to learn and to practice meditation, yoga and/or deep breathing. [Studies ](https://mindfulness.worldsecuresystems.com/publications/pdfs/Peer-reviewed-articles/Mucosal_immunity_modulated_by_integrative_meditation_in_a_dose-dependent_fashion_Posner2010.pdf)have shown that even a short course of meditation can significantly increase our immunity by decreasing the body's cortisol level and increasing important antibodies called IgAs. These IgAs line our respiratory tract and gut and are our first line of defence against pathogens. Don't forget the all important 'vitamin L' (aka Love)! Even if we are physically isolated we can still stay close to our loved ones through the many telecommunication tools at our disposal. Love helps lower stress and therefore cortisol and floods our brain with healthy and happy hormones and neurotransmitters such as oxytocin and dopamine. 5. EXERCISE Regularly Low and moderate physical activity (both aerobic and anaerobic) help boost your immune system. Avoid heavy training or over-training especially if you are already feeling tired or depleted as this will weaken your immune system. Work out outside if you can! This way you'll also benefit from absorption of very important vitamin D. Immune cells are favourably affected by vitamin D and nothing beats its natural form- from direct sunlight. If the outdoor experience isn't possible consider an online yoga video (or whatever type of exercise you enjoy doing) straight from your living room. In this case take vitamin D supplements! In addition to the above suggestions, if you do feel that you would benefit from a little boost, taking an adaptogen plant can be a good idea. Reishi, ashwaganda, ginseng are a few examples, all of which are sold in supplement form and help the body adapt to stress, anxiety and reinforce the immune system. Conclusion It's important to feel reassured, most of us are already doing many of the right things to support a healthy immune system. Although the research on the Corona virus is ongoing, we do know that proper sleep, exercise, gut health and diet are all significant contributing factors to a healthy immune system.
