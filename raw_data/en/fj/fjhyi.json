'Retracing steps of the past through the lives of two pioneering sons of India, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Sir Kailash Chandra Bose, their contribution to India, the genesis of contemporary Homeopathy & Philanthropy in India and thoughts on how to survive isolation & Covid' -in conversation with Dr Pratip Banerjee and Mr Debottam T Bose Thursday, 10th September 2020, organised by Museum Society of Mumbai Historically, Homeopathy has an excellent track record in the treatments of Epidemics / Pandemics. Homeopathic medicines are safe to use and we can expect very little, if any, side-effects as can be experienced by using other systems of medicine. Dr Pratip Banerji, the fourth generation homeopath in the family, did his post graduation from London College of Classical Homoeopathy. After post graduation, Pratip was invited to appear before the Board of the British Registrar of Complementary Physicians, which he did. Thereafter he received a letter from the Board asking him to give the address of the place where Pratip would like to set up his practice in the UK, so that the Board could refer patients to him. But Pratip returned to India to set up his own practice in Calcutta to follow the footsteps of his father and serve his countrymen. He further completed his Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) from the JRN Rajasthan Vidyapeeth (Deemed University), Udaipur, India. Dr. Pratip Banerji brought scientific approach and international standards to allow verifiability of their research data. The process of data accrual and documentation according to the highest international standards was introduced by him. This has made their research acceptable to the international scientific community. His vision into the future of homeopathy has greatly encouraged the PBHRF in its research collaborations with premier international scientific establishments thus gaining a foothold for homeopathy in the international mainstream medical platform. Keeping in view the family tradition to give medical aid to the under privileged and never to loose contact with one's grass root, Pratip runs a charitable clinic where patients are treated for free. The charitable clinic is an institution by itself, especially in a developing country like India where 90% of the population is below the poverty line. It has come to our notice that some people are making money by selling information the The Banerji ProtocolsTM, and selling the book from other websites. We make it clear that this is the only official website of PBHRF and we do not know of any other book on or related to The Banerji ProtocolsTM or validate it. The book titled 'THE BANERJI PROTOCOLS- A New Method of Treatment with Homeopathic Medicines' was written by Late Dr. Prasanta Banerji and Dr. Pratip Banerji, and its sole publisher is Dr. Pratip Banerji. This is a medical book and the writers of this book were/are doctors with lots of experience in the field. Unknown individual(s) who are selling extra information on The Banerji ProtocolsTM are not doctors, and the doing this for the sole purpose of making money. We do not take any responsibility whatsoever, of the effects of such consultations on users. "}
