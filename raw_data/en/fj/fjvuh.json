I have another reason to feel special about presiding over our AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting in Dallas. This was the city where I attended my very first Academy meeting, in 1979. It was also the very first meeting of the American Academy of Otolaryngology (not yet amended with Head and Neck Surgery) after separating from the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngolo-gy. I was totally blown away and inspired by that meeting. One of the highlights for me was a movie (in the days before video) demonstrating the use of a laser to remove a cancer from the scalp. The film was produced by Paul Ward, MD, a giant in our field who has recently passed away. The movie was quite bloody, and it turned out that the tumor had spread intracranially. (There were no CT scans in those days.) Dr. Ward concluded that the laser was not such a good tool for this lesion! I had great ad- miration for his courage and honesty in presenting this\u2014an observation that was repeatedly confirmed during the years I knew this man. Every year, I look forward to the Annual Meet- ing with great anticipation. One of my mentors, Gail Neely, MD, once explained to me that such a gathering is like a baked potato. Allow me to ex- plain this analogy. A potato is very nutritious. There is ample evidence that one could be quite healthy on a diet that consisted of nothing but potatoes and water. (Similarly, you could probably eventually gather all the information presented at the AAO- HNSF Meeting by using journals, textbooks, and online resources.) But the real enjoyment of a baked potato is the other stuff: the sour cream, the cheese, the chives, the bacon. And at the AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting & OTO EXPO SM, we not only hear live presentations and discussions, we can also talk about the issues with friends and colleagues. And to top it all off, we can see all the latest products that we need for our practices and are able to meet personally with the vendors. So I hope to see you all in Dallas. In addition to barbecue, you should also try chicken fried steak, which I consider to be the \"national\" food of Texas. I can vouch for the chicken fried steak at our head-quarters hotel as being possibly the best that I have ever tasted! I don't know about you, but I am really looking forward to some good Texas barbecue when we get to Dallas for our Annual Meeting in September. When I was a surgery intern in Baltimore, one of the nurses brought some \"barbecue\" to a potluck. It was not barbecue. It was ground meat in barbecue sauce (aka a sloppy Joe). Also, you do not \"barbecue\" a steak when you cook it over a grill. \"Barbecuing\" is a highly devel- oped process for cooking meat, especially brisket and ribs. I know this very well because I have deep Texas roots. I was born in Galveston, when my father was a medical student at the University of Texas Medical Center and my mother was a pioneering occupation- al therapist. I grew up in a small town near the Gulf Coast where my father was the family doctor for nearly everyone I knew. We had quarter horses and I was a barrel racer in summer rodeos. I had barbecue so many times, in so many versions, that it was al- most like barbecue sauce flowed through my veins. At the AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting & OTO EXPOSM, we not only hear live presentations and discussions, we can also talk about the issues with friends and colleagues. Gayle E.

Equally important and challenging will be the selec- tion of the clinical topics that make the most sense and will apply most broadly to otolaryngology. Clinical domains, such as sinusitis, hoarseness, otitis media, tonsillitis, and cerumen impaction, will be will common procedures, such as laryngoscopy, nasal endoscopy, tonsillectomy, and myringotomy tube placement. After the registry is functioning, additional clinical conditions or procedures can be added in a phased approach so that, ultimately, the registry will represent the full spectrum of our specialty. One of the great concerns that our Members have revolves around the ability, as well as the difficulty, of reporting quality measures. The recent passage of H.R. 2, repealing the SGR and codifying future quality param-eters, consolidated the reporting requirements to center on quality, resource use, meaningful use, and clinical practice improvement. While on the surface this appears to complicate reporting responsibilities for practitioners, the clear commitment to quality as a major feature in future payment models sets the course for physicians to meaningfully participate going forward. The knowledge that this will be required allows us to proceed and develop the tools necessary for our Members to be effective partic-ipants in this type of system. This new law also reinforces the roles and utility of QCDRs. QCDR designation is important because it allows those Members participating in the registry to meet Medicare quality reporting require- ments by virtue of their participation. Our timing could not be better in terms of starting this initiative. Many with existing registries today will have to make significant adjustments to their platforms to max- imize the registry's utility in meeting these new quality reporting requirements. A specialty-based QCDR can be used to report on all four areas of focus within the new Medicare payment model. The production of new perfor - mance measures and practical quality outcomes measures can be expedited and approved using the registry format. This will allow specialties, such as otolaryngology, with a broad spectrum of clinical expertise, the ability to accel- erate the production of meaningful reporting and patient improvement instruments representing the needs of our Members and their patients. Look for future articles in the Bulletin and ongoing updates through ENTConnect and the Academy website. In addition, we are planning a registry Miniseminar immediately following the Opening Ceremony at the Annual Meeting. As the Registry Task Force, chaired by Lisa E. Ishii, MD, MHS, completes its work to define what will be otolaryngology's initial Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR), it is appropriate to go over some basics related to clinical registries. Registries can be used for a variety of purposes and can be classified based on the type of data collected, as well as the time frame for collection. The most common are product/device registries, health services registries, and disease process registries. Data collection can be either a single-point collection or longitudinal study format. Providers participate in registries to report quality mea-sures and participate in value-based payment systems; improve quality of care through enhanced population management; participate in recognition and certification programs (MOC); inform treatment decisions; and create data for scientific clinical research. Probably the task force's most important decision is how otolaryngology would best utilize a QCDR. The range of options includes public reporting; informing guideline development and supporting performance measure development; demonstrating clinical effective- ness; supporting quality improvement; demonstrating payer value; informing alternative payment models; and maintenance of certification and licensure. Once those priorities are determined, the task force will proceed with validation of its decision both internally within the specialty and externally to determine the interest of other stakeholders for the use of clinical data related to otolaryngology. This validation will be done through a combination of surveys and/or interviews with the key stakeholder groups. This will help inform whether the registry will be procedure-based, condition-based, or population-based. The method of data collection will be critical. Ideally, most data can be extracted from existing electronic medical records systems. However, web-based systems can also be quite effective. We also have been conducting interviews with other registry providers to gather information on best practices in registry development, identify key vendors, and gather feedback on lessons learned given the complexity of registry development. Once these determinations are made, the process of selecting the best vendor begins. The AAO-HNS has retained Avalere as a consultant to assist in this pro-cess. There are a number of active QCDRs operating, and their experience and diversity will be beneficial An idea that is developed and put into action is more important than an idea that exists only as an idea.

The AAO-HNS/F continues to work to support its Members in the most effective and efficient way possible while remaining in compliance with all debt covenants, including the requirement for a balanced budget. The FY16 budget preparation began in advance of the Boards of Directors strategic planning meeting with staff leaders reviewing their budgets to ensure that all continuing stra-tegic items were able to be funded for FY16. The budget planning process involved each of the business units of AAO-HNS/F submitting their budgets to the financial team that worked with them to assure that revenue and expenses are in line with the mission and priorities of AAO-HNS/F. The financial team is composed of Lynn Frischkorn, director of Budgeting and Special Projects, and Carrie Hanlon, CPA, senior director of Financial Operations. The financial team presented the proposed budget to the FISC for review and approval in March. The FISC was pleased to see that the strategic goal of identifying $600,000 of cost savings in the FY16 budget was able to be achieved. This allowed for new strategic items developed during the strategic planning meeting to be funded and incorporated into the proposed budget. The Executive Committees (ECs) of the Boards of Directors (BODs) were presented with the FISC proposed FY16 budget and recommended endorsement for approval by the BODs. During their April meeting the BODs reviewed and conditionally approved the FY16 budget that is presented here for our membership. In early spring, the FISC also reviewed financial results for the first six months of the FY15 budget year showing that a favorable variance, as compared to budget, is projected for the year. Highlights of the FY16 budget The FY16 balanced budget is being presented at $20.86 million and prioritizes the direction of the BODs. As an outcome of the strategic planning meeting the BODs approved up to $3 million of reserves to be used for the implementation of a new data registry and incorporated $2 million into the FY16 pro- AAO-HNS/F Combined Budgets Approved Budget FY15Proposed BudgetFY16 Revenue Membership Dues $6,700,500 $6,855,000 Meetings Program Sales 1,650,000 1,618,100 Corporate & Individual and Interest 220,500 320,000 Miscellaneous 221,700 140,500 Funds Released from Restrictions 831,600 597,700 Funds Designated for Data Registry 0 2,000,000 Revenue $18,600,000 $20,861,800 Expenses 295,100 Occupancy (DC office space) 111,000 28,400 Grants 672,000 664,300 Consultants & Professional Fees 2,637,900 2,674,200 Data Registry Support 0 2,000,000 T otal Direct Expenses $7,040,400 forefront ENTNET.ORG/BULLETIN AAO-HNS BULLETIN JUNE 2015 9Safeguard your practice against data breaches The healthcare industry suffers more data breaches than any other business segment\u2014a total of 51 percent of all breaches.

As the nation's largest physician-owned medical malpractice insurer\u2014insuring over 1,000 otolaryngologists nationwide\u2014The Doctors Company has unparalleled insight into the broad range of claims in otolaryngology. And backed by the financial strength of $4.3 billion in assets and a membership of 75,000 physicians, The Doctors Company offers AAO-HNS Members a unique com-bination of coverage features, aggressive claims defense, and unrivaled protection. Qualified AAO-HNS Members receive a program discount of 5 percent and a claims-free credit of up to 25 percent, as well as participation in the company's multiyear dividend program. posed budget for this purpose. This addition accounts for the majority of the difference between the FY15 and FY16 total budget. Proposed FY16 revenue, before consider - ation of reserves to be used for the data regis-try, is composed of approximately one-third membership dues, one-third Annual Meeting revenue, and one-third other revenue. Areas where revenue is budgeted to increase include membership dues, as a result of the dues in-crease in calendar year 2015; product and pro- gram sales, as a result of pricing changes; and interest income, as a result of the investment of cash held for repayment of the building debt. Annual Meeting revenue from the Dallas meeting is budgeted to be consistent with the Orlando meeting even with the change to pro- vide Instruction Courses at no additional cost. An increase in EXPO booth sales is expected to make up the shortfall in registration revenue in the first year of the Annual Meeting format change. Miscellaneous income remains largely comprised of sublease income for the lease of unused office space. Revenue from restricted funds varies from year-to-year depending on donor restrictions and timing. The expenses for the AAO-HNS/F are separated below into two areas. Direct Operating Expenses include costs directly related to carrying out the priorities of the strategic plan and on-going mission-re-lated programs. Budgeted costs have been included to allow for the implementation of the new data registry; development of appropriate use criteria based on clinical indicators and guidelines; and development of a consensus on a comprehensive otolaryn-gology curriculum, including resources for content development. Allocated Costs relate to staffing and benefits as well as the operating costs that are incurred for the good of the whole organiza- tion, such as occupancy and building-related expenses, and organizational-wide HR, financial, and IT costs. Increases in these costs are due to inflation, salary adjustments, and the addition of staff to support the newly approved initiatives. The complete budget is available to any Academy Member who requests it in writing. Email requests to Carrie Hanlon, CPA, senior director, Financial Operations to bulletin@entnet.org.

On April 16, President Obama signed into law H.R. 2, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA). In one swoop, H.R. 2\u2014per - haps the most critical piece of health-related legislation since the Affordable Care Act\u2014delivered to the physician community not one, but several legislative victories. Most notably, of course, are the pro- visions to permanently repeal the flawed Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula used to determine payments to physicians under the Medicare program. Repealing the SGR has long been a top legislative priority for the AAO-HNS and others in the physician com-munity. In fact, it took more than 14 years and laboring through 17 short-term payment \"patches\" to arrive at the policy agreements that coalesced in H.R. 2. So, what does the bill do? In regard to Medi- care physician payments, H.R. 2 stipulates: Immediate repeal of the SGR formula. A \"period of stability\" with a .5 percent in- crease in physician payments for five years. A 5 percent added incentive payment for physicians in new Alternative Payment Models (APMs). Increased funding for technical assistance to practices of 15 or fewer professionals. Creation of a technical advisory committee to review and recommend physician-devel-oped APMs via an open comment process. Other \"victories\" included in H.R. 2 are: Consolidation of three existing incentive programs (Physician Quality Reporting System, Value-Based Modifier, and Mean- ingful Use Electronic Health Records). Combining these programs via a new Mer - it-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) program will help to set performance thresholds and offer flexibility for special- ties in achieving the necessary reporting requirements for bonus payments. Rescission of the new CMS policy to tran-sition all 10- and 90-day global payment codes to 0-day codes by 2018. Also noteworthy about H.R. 2 is the manner in which it was passed. In total, 484 lawmakers in both chambers voted in favor of the bill. Given that legislative gridlock and partisan bickering have become the norm on Capitol Hill, the bipartisanship achieved on H.R. 2 was surprising and refreshing. For so long, the SGR issue has operated as a \"vacuum\" on Capitol Hill, often inhibit-ing work on other critical initiatives. In fact, it was frustration relating to the cyclical \"doc fix\" that led Congressional leaders, namely Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to\u2014finally\u2014begin private negotiations to permanently address the SGR issue. In reality, the burst of activity to resolve the SGR issue this spring has been two years in the making (see timeline). Throughout the 113 th Congress, leaders from the committees with jurisdiction over health issues in both the House and Senate worked in earnest (with the physician community) to craft the Medi-care physician payment replacement policies TIMELINE OF SGR REPEAL ACTIVITIES FEBRUARY 2013JULY 2013DECEMBER 2013113TH CONGRESS FEBRUARY 2013 House Energy & Commerce (E&C) Committee holds hearing on SGR issue.

In addition to hearings, briefings, hill meet- ings, stakeholder sessions, and mark-ups, a key component to the evolution of the SGR replacement policies were myriad comment letters submitted by organizations across the healthcare spectrum. For example, in 2013, at the height of the policy development phase, the AAO-HNS alone submitted seven SGR-related comment letters. With the SGR replacement policies in place by early 2014, efforts to advance the bill were thwarted by the question of how to pay for the measure. What changed? The answer is that Congressional leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers agreed to view the SGR formula as the budget gimmick it was. The track record for SGR patches was proof that Congress never intended to allow sweeping cuts to take place. So, why not finally fix the problem\u2014even if it meant not funding the whole package. In the end, after substantial negotiations by party leaders, only the add-on provisions included in H.R. 2 (e.g., extension of the CHIP pro- gram) were paid for. Next steps Is the SGR replacement policy perfect? No. It is, however, a starting point. Now the AAO- HNS will work toward improving upon the foundation set forth in H.R. 2.

Krouse, MD, PhD, MBA, Professor and Chairman, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, T emple University School of Medicine and Editor in Chief, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery No doubt about it. We are living in an era of uncertainty in healthcare. In medicine in the United States, we have been accus- tomed for decades to a system that has reward- ed volume and intensity of services delivered. While the system has stimulated advances that have enhanced care of patients with acute medical illnesses, access to that care remains spotty and overall health, especially among the most vulnerable, generally lags behind most of the developed world. The cost of healthcare in the United States continues to skyrocket, with expenditures approaching $3 trillion in 2013, or almost 18 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), significantly outpacing our nearest comparators. Obviously, this system is unsustainable in its present design.In this era of uncertainty, transitions in healthcare are underway: TRANSITION FROM TO Fee-for-serviceBundled payments by networks and illnesses Incentivized for volumeIncentivized for value Fragmented, individualized careAligned, continuity of care Acute hospital focusChronic outpatient disease management Nonstandardized paper recordsIT-based standardized records Given these transitions, we as otolaryngologists currently live in the \"straddle\" of this era of uncer - tainty. We continue to benefit from fee-for-service medicine, yet payer contracts are moving toward a greater emphasis on value, cost-reduction, and improved quality in processes and outcomes. Bundled payment arrangements and ACOs are on the horizon. Physicians continue to practice in an individualistic manner, although the influence of guidelines-based medicine is increasingly felt as a mechanism to decrease variation in care. Unfortunately, it is in this straddle that we see adverse impact on physician revenue. Payments have declined as payers transition away from fee-for-service, yet incentives for quality are not in place to sufficiently offset this decline. Investment in IT infrastructure has been required, yet physicians have seen little return for this cost. It is unclear exactly how future payment systems will unfold, the timing of implementation, and how to advantageously position ourselves as otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons. In the future world of healthcare, the interface of health economics and physician practice is at the point of V ALUE. In economic systems, the value of goods or services is understood as an in- teraction of the quality of those goods or services The Board of Governors fall meeting: Plan to be there Peter J. Abramson, MD, Immediate Past Chair, AAO-HNS Board of Governors We are all ex- cited about the fall Academy BOG meeting. The official start of the AAO-HNSF 2015 Annual Meeting & OTO EXPOSM is on Sunday, September 27. How- ever, the Board of Governors (BOG) meetings are held the day prior. On Saturday, September 26, the BOG will conduct its fall committee meetings. Over the last several years, the BOG leadership has placed a strong emphasis on ed- ucational and informative, yet action-oriented, meetings. This is the \"roll up your sleeves and get to work time.\" As we all are aware, much of the work of committees happens offline before the meetings. These committee meetings are not only the presentation of the work done over the previous six months, but a time to formulate and formalize action plans that will shape the grassroots advocacy efforts for the year to come. Chair Ken Yanagisawa, MD, and Vice- Chair Hayes H. Wanamaker, MD, continue to work on strengthening the Socioeconomic and Grassroots Committee's regional representa- tion structure. Regional reports at the meeting create an exciting forum for sharing of issues and trends nationwide. The ever-evolving and strong working relationship with the Academy's Health Policy unit has strengthened the com- mittee's ability to work on the pressing issues affecting otolaryngologists right now. Chair Stacey L. Ishman, MD, MPH, and Vice-Chair Steven T. Kmucha, MD, JD, have reinvigorated the newly reminted and redi-rected Societies and Engagement Committee (formerly Rules and Regulations Committee). They recently have completed the arduous, but necessary task of updating the BOG Bylaws. By switching gears from its focus on rules and regulations to society engagement, this commit-tee will focus on building strong local, state, and regional societies and strengthening the interaction with the Board of Governors. Under the strong leadership of Chair, Susan R. Cordes, MD, and Vice-Chair, J. Scott Magnuson, MD, the Legislative Af- fairs Committee has divided its members into two active task forces\u2014the ENT PAC and Legislative Grassroots. Through great- er integration with the legislative advocacy team and the state tracker program, this committee has engaged its Members in a more active role in the committee process. BOG meetings are an integral part of our focus for a hands-on, action-oriented approach in our mission of grassroots ad-vocacy. It is important to make time to be at the Saturday BOG committee meetings. By attending, you will stay current on pressing legislative, policy, socioeconomic issues, and become integrated into the process of advo- cating for our specialty and livelihood. at the forefront ENTNET.ORG/BULLETIN AAO-HNS BULLETIN JUNE 2015 13and the cost at which they are provided. In other words: V ALUE = QUALITY \u00f7 COST. Specific to healthcare, value can be created by increasing the quality of the care, decreasing the cost of the care, or some combination of both. Im- plicit in the discussion, however, is that consumers must be able to evaluate the quality of services provided, making public reporting of outcome data a necessary component of any value-based healthcare system. Physicians and health systems will need to create value propositions that reflect the needs of patients and their communities. So what trends do we foresee? Healthcare will move toward increasing integration and expanded use of multidisciplinary teams. There will be greater transparency in price and quality, as well as mutual accountability with physicians and health systems. Rewards will be based on system outcomes rather than high volumes. At the physician level, incen-tives will be negotiated with health systems, and may be based on some combination of productivity and achievement of quality and service goals. Otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons need to be proactive in this era of uncertainty in healthcare. The AAO-HNSF is participating in the process of identifying low-value services through its \"Choosing Wisely\" campaign. It is interesting that just one of these 10 principles is specifically related to otolaryngology procedures. Future initiatives must be outcomes-based and define appropriate use of procedural interventions. Otolaryngologists must develop patient-centered quality indicators that define how and when care should be provided. Data and analytics will be critical, and the AAO-HNS is developing performance indicators and a comprehensive data registry that will assist in addressing these important issues of quality and val-ue. Furthermore, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery will continue to expand its content in health policy and economics to support otolaryngologists as key partners in the care of their patients. So, out of the chaos of this era of uncertainty comes the opportunity for leadership and pro-active change. We must define evidence-based performance and quality metrics that allow us to thrive in the changing environment of health reform. We must engage patients and families in their care decisions, with the goals of increased satisfaction, improved outcomes, and reduced costs. With a sharp focus on quality, we, as otolaryngologists, can navigate healthcare uncertainty and take the lead in defining value in otolaryngology care.

Consider your social media choices careful- ly when looking for a new job. Employers are now looking at social media accounts to get more information about potential employees. Is the content appropriate and does it reflect you in a positive way? 2References have become more, not less, valuable. Your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 may get you the in- terview, but it's the report your references provide that will win you the job in a close race with another qualified candidate. 3The format, content, and presentation of references lists have changed. In the past, the standard approach was to offer a simple list of references and their contact in- formation. In 2015, savvy job seekers are mod- ernizing their reference lists to make a powerful statement of their professional qualifications. 4Employers will use your peers and subordinates as refer - ences. Don't assume that employers will only check with Human Resources or your former supervisor for reference purposes. Employers are increasingly scrutinizing less traditional references such as peers and coworkers. 5Keep those workplace bullies off your reference list\u2014they can destroy your chances for new employment. Despite negative press about bad bosses (or coworkers), bullies still abound in the workplace and can adversely affect your current or future employment.

Through all of this hard work and study, we sometimes neglect to realize the huge impact we have on the lives of others, not only patients, but also their families and those around them. We overlook how this in turn impacts our lives not as surgeons, but as people. As part of the surgical team of the FACES foundation I travelled to Lambayeque, Peru, with the objective of treating patients with cleft lip and palate de-formities, but little did I know that we would be doing so much more than that. We were changing lives! My name is Javier Gonz\u00e1lez-Castro, I am currently training in facial plastic and microvascular surgery at Oregon Health and Sciences University (OHSU). As a fellow I was given the opportunity to be a part of the FACES foundation surgical team, an opportunity for which I am eternally grateful. As part of the group, I traveled to Lam- bayeque, Peru, where we evaluated 90 patients and operated on 47 between January 25 and 30, 2015. This effort could not have been completed if not for the help of the local Lions Club, the people from Belen Hospital, and the whole FACES team. I would also like to thank the AAO-HNSF Humanitarian Efforts Committee for helping me with many of the costs associated with the trip. During this trip we treated children of all ages, performing cleft lip repairs, palatoplas-ties, cleft rhinoplasties, and alveolar bone grafts. Although the babies always leave their footprint in our mind, the patient who stood out the most in my mind was a 12-year-old who had lived her entire life with a wide cleft lip/palate and no access to adequate help. When we saw her before surgery, we saw what everyone else saw: a girl with a terrible deformity who in the eyes of the people of her village was truly a monster. To her family and others who knew her, they saw a devel-opmentally delayed 12-year-old who could not even speak and shied away from making eye contact. When I first met this child, I saw a shy, scared child who was socially delayed due to the deformity that she had to live with all her life. She went into surgery that day not knowing what lay ahead; she had no idea of what she would see the next time she looked in the mirror. The surgery was a success! The whole team was very happy with the results, but the most beautiful part was when this child looked at herself in the mirror for the first time. Her face filled with joy, she started to hug all those in sight whether she knew them or not. It was as if an incredible weight was lifted off her shoulders; the scarlet letter had been removed. Instantly you could see how she changed from a scared young girl, to a beautiful young girl with so much life ahead of her. Before the surgery her eyes looked like those of a scared old lady; after the surgery you see the eyes of a cute little girl, full of light and love. It is astonishing to think that those eyes belong to the same person. I feel truly blessed to have been a part of that and hope to continue to be a part of it. It is amazing that by simply giving this child a new smile, we let the life and light shine through her new eyes. Cleft lip/palate surgery changed the outlook for this 12-year-old Peruvian patient.at the forefront ENTNET.ORG/BULLETIN AAO-HNS BULLETIN JUNE 2015 15AAPC selected to provide coding and practice management resources to AAO-HNS Members As a result of healthcare delivery system reform, otolaryngolo- gist-head and neck surgeons are faced with a rapid transition in the way they will be paid for professional services.

Moore, MD, Emory University, Atlanta, GA In 2014, it was estimated that there would be 55,070 new cancer cases of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. Additionally, it was esti- mated that 12,000 of those diagnosed with this cancer would die, thus representing 2.0 percent of all cancer deaths. The five-year survival rate of these cancers is approximately 50 percent. When compared to white populations, black males are almost twice as likely to die from oral cancers. Although early detection has been proved to increase the survival rate; prevention strategies focused on high-risk behavior are critical to eliminate new cases. The high-risk behaviors most frequently associated with head and neck cancer (HNSC- Ca) are heavy alcohol use, but most importantly tobacco use (cigarette smoking, pipe smoking, or smokeless tobacco use). Also, HNSCCa are most frequently diagnosed in men and persons ages 55-64 years. Due to the increased mortality rate of black males, preventable high-risk behaviors, and a need to intervene in earlier age groups, the purpose of this research is to characterize smok-ing cessation intervention strategies available to adolescent black males to impact the prevalence rate of HNSCCa among this target audience. The following questions guided the research protocol: 1. How has health education/health pro- motion been used to engage black men around smoking cessation? 2. What are the barriers and facilitators to the use of programmatic initiatives geared toward smoking cessation among black men? A structured keyword search of title and ab- stracts was conducted across a variety of databas- es representing different academic disciplines. Selected articles met the following inclusion criteria: (1) represented original research; (2) appeared in a peer-reviewed journal/publication; (3) addressed at least one of the two research questions. The methodology of Young and Solomon for Cross-Sectional Studies was used to critically appraise each article. The initial search yielded 189 articles, which were condensed to 21 articles. The chosen publications were entered into a database and stratified by which research question it addressed. Approximately 90 percent of the selected articles focused on a mixed-gen-der population; 70 percent of the interventions utilized Internet-based or application-based health commu-nication strategies; and none of the interventions reported a study population com-posed exclusively of adolescent black males. The primary intervention strategies focused on support, with particular emphasis on peer-to- peer communications; motivational interview-ing; expert counseling; email counseling; and social network sites. Moreover, the trans-the- oretical model of behavior change was a commonly applied behavior change theory. The identified barriers from this analysis were gender; cultural norms; childhood physical abuse; and childhood sexual abuse. Converse- ly, the facilitators to smoking cessation among the target audience were motivation; health-risk communication; personal responsibility or choice; parental involvement; and government interventions against the tobacco industry. In summary, these findings illustrate smok- ing cessation programs geared toward adoles-cent populations and emphasize the frequent use of evidence-based health communication strategies in conjunction with traditional health behavior interventions. Furthermore, this study highlights the lack of smoking ces- sation interventions geared toward adolescent black males, while identifying gaps in research regarding black males' smoking behavior and smoking cessation. The Diversity Committee is committed to serving populations that may have less access to care and is devoted to edu-cating our patients and communities.

These relationships have allowed opportunities for dialogue with the highest level executives at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and several private payer organizations, includ- ing United Healthcare (UHC). As a result of ongoing efforts to cultivate these affiliations, the Academy leadership has been able to proactively address many potentially prob-lematic policies for otolaryngology members and their patients, working together with these payers to develop appropriate coverage policies. Some specific examples of how the Academy has led joint efforts with payers are noted below. United Healthcare There have been many collaborative efforts between the Academy's leadership and UHC over the years. Recently, national Medical Directors at UHC have approached the Acad-emy for input and dialogue regarding several important policies im- pacting members and their pa- tients, including UHC's balloon sinus ostial dilation medical policy, rhinoplasty policy, and their Premium Designation Program. Continued balloon sinus ostial dilation coverage In 2014, UHC reached out to the Academy requesting input for its draft balloon sinus ostial dilation medical policy. The Academy's Rhinology Paranasal Sinus Committee and 3P quickly reviewed the draft policy, providing UHC comments by their deadline and request- ing a conference call to discuss the importance of continued coverage for balloon sinus ostial dilation. UHC agreed that it would be helpful for their highest level policy leaders to discuss the proposed policy with Academy leaders, including 3P members as well as experts in rhinology. After a constructive and detailed discussion about the benefits of balloon sinus ostial dilation as an alternative to endoscopic sinus surgery, UHC decided to maintain cover - age in their policy, effective April 1, 2015. Rhinoplasty coverage policy The Academy's expert input was also requested by UHC in April 2015 to review and provide comment on their proposed rhinoplasty medical policy. This is a version of a previous policy, which has undergone numerous favorable revisions based on Academy's 3P and Rhinology and Paranasal Sinus Committee advocacy and input. UHC's willingness to seek our feedback on this policy is further evidence of the reciprocal relationship that has been developed over the years between UHC and the Academy. Premium Designation Program In addition, UHC reached out to the Academy in 2013 to discuss their Premium Designation Program, a type of quality tiering program that assesses otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons on their quality and cost efficiency as compared to peers in their area. Based on many concerns raised by the Academy and its Members, UHC delayed implementation of the program for otolaryngologists for over a year. In the fall 2014, prior to implementation of the program that included otolaryngolo- gy-head and neck surgeons, UHC once again contacted the Academy to continue dialogue regarding significant ongoing concerns about the program. While UHC decided to move forward with assessment and public display of otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons designations, the national Medical Director leading the program, Mureen Allen, MD, requested additional input from Academy Members. Further, during a follow-up confer - ence call held with Academy Health Policy and Quality and Performance Measurement staff, Dr. Allen noted interest in receiving ongoing feedback from Academy mem-bers about the program moving forward. In addition, UHC has indicated willingness to provide Academy leaders with step-by-step clarity about their methodology, and interest in working together to develop helpful resources like talking points about how to review, understand, and appeal (if necessary) the reports. ENTNET.ORG/BULLETIN AAO-HNS BULLETIN JUNE 2015 21 Medicaid allergy policy changed In addition to the work with UHC, the Acad- emy's 3P Workgroup, Academy Executive Leadership, and Health Policy staff collab- orated with Superior HealthPlan, the largest Medicaid carrier in Texas serving approx- imately 1 million beneficiaries, to review their credentialing policy regarding allergy testing and immunotherapy services in its network. While the Academy does not usually participate in Medicaid advocacy, 3P leaders determined that the potential impact of the proposed policy required Academy attention. After Academy leaders and colleagues from the American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy (AAOA) met with the highest level Superior HealthPlan executives to inform them about the extensive training that physicians in the specialty receive, Superior HealthPlan agreed to auto-credential all board certified and board eligible otolaryngologist-head and neck sur - geons to perform allergy testing and immuno-therapy services in its network. This accom-plishment is due to the hard work of Academy leaders, along with that of our colleagues with the AAOA, the American Board of Otolaryn- gology (ABOto), and Superior HealthPlan. Ongoing issues with diagnostic imaging reimbursement policies While the Academy has realized many suc- cesses with some public and private payers as mentioned above, there are other coverage issues that continue to provide challenges for our members as they work to provide quality care to their patients. One of these issues relates to restrictive and inappropriate coverage policies for Cone Beam Computed Tomography (\"CBCT\" or otherwise known as \"miniCT\"). The Academy is aware of problematic payer policies that are arbitrary in nature, with some payers even going so far as to state that miniCT is investigational and experimental when the technology has been FDA-approved for many years. Some payers are not allowing otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons to administer and/or interpret diagnostic imaging studies or to receive appro- priate reimbursement for billing the profes- sional and/or technical component of imaging services. In response, the Academy has sent several comment letters to payers advocating for changes to these policies, focusing on the numerous benefits of point-of-care imaging for patients and noting that otolaryngologists possess the training, expertise, and knowledge to provide these services. However, the private payers have remained unresponsive to our comments and maintain these restrictive and inappropriate policies. 3P leaders and Health Policy staff continue to work with Imaging Committee leaders and the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission CT-division, to advocate with several private payers to provide appropriate reimbursement for miniCT services. While these advocacy efforts continue, Members are encouraged to utilize the Academy's Template Appeal Letter and Advocacy Statement on Diagnostic Imaging when corresponding with payers, see: www.entnet.org/ content/ coding-corner. In the future, the Academy's clinical data registry and appropriate use criteria will be extremely valuable to Members and benefit their patients in similar instances. In the meantime, the Academy leadership is working diligently to implement a broad strategy, to create positive change with at least one of the payers and their restrictive policy, so that positive momentum with other payers might be achieved as well. Stay tuned for further updates on these import- ant advocacy efforts. T ools for you: Member resources As Members know, the healthcare market is ever-changing with increas-ing demands placed on physicians in addition to providing quality care. 3P and the Health Policy staff work together to ensure that otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons are well-positioned to meet the challenges of today, as well as those on the horizon, by providing updated practice management re-sources. These Members-only resources, such as template appeal letters, CPT for ENT s, and Clinical Indicators, are valuable tools for thriv - ing otolaryngology practices and their patients. We encourage all Members to stay informed about the latest health policy changes and updates via the Bulletin, ENTConnect, the HP Update, and weekly news. We also encour - age all members with socioeconomic-related questions to utilize the Practice Management Member Inquiry T ool. As a result of ongoing efforts to cultivate these affiliations, the Academy leadership has been able to proactively address many potentially problematic policies for otolaryngology members and their patients, working together with these payers to develop appropriate coverage policies.22 JUNE 2015 AAO-HNS BULLETIN ENTNET.ORG/BULLETIN The Academy strongly supported the repeal of the SGR formula and the movement toward devel- opment of new payment models in the landmark legislation that became law in April 2015. We believe this effort will add to the momentum in the shift from the traditional fee-for-ser - vice (FFS) system to value-based care. As part of the Academy's efforts over the past few years to prepare for this transition, the Ad Hoc Payment Model workgroup was created. Led by co-chairs Robert Lorenz, MD, MBA, and Jane T. Dillon, MD, MBA, and managed by Health Policy staff, this group is comprised of physician leaders from research, quality improvement, 3P, and the Board of Governors. The main goals of this workgroup include reviewing potential opportunities to improve quality of care and decrease cost for otolaryngology-related ser - vices and dissemination of information about alternative payment models. To that end, the Ad Hoc Payment Model Workgroup created a new Member awareness campaign to identify and leverage Member alternative payment model (APM) knowledge. Member awareness campaign To assess Member knowledge and participa- tion, the Ad Hoc Payment Model Workgroup partnered with the Board of Governors (BOG) to conduct a survey regarding Mem-bers' experiences in states already involved in a new payment model. The survey revealed an eagerness to learn more about alternative payment models, as well as several Members with leadership roles in these new schemas. These leaders were asked to tell their per - sonal stories to help the membership become more familiar with how APMs are affect- ing the specialty. In addition, these leaders helped to provide Academy members with an introduction to the risks and benefits of the various payment model structures. These personal experience reports were dis- tributed to the membership at-large via periodic ENTConnect posts detailing otolaryngology APM involvement. (See \"Endocrine Surgery Bundled Payment Model\" at far right.) Looking toward the future of the healthcare system, the Academy will be well-poised to work with private and public payers with the establishment of an Academy-owned registry.

Locandro, MD, excerpt from ENTConnect Report Our practice is an eight-physician, single-specialty independent practice with six offices in a major metropolitan area. Several years ago, one of our surgeons developed a busy endocrine (thyroid/parathyroid) surgical practice. Patients came from greater and greater distances\u2014even from other countries\u2014and some were willing to pay cash for surgery. Pricing from local hospitals and mul-tispecialty centers required negotiation on a per-case basis that was inconsistent and often did not include anesthesia, pathology, and other fees. Similar to all practices, some patients defer surgery due to cost, especially if they have high-deductible insurance coverage, catastrophic coverage only, or no insurance. In 2011, our practice opened a single-specialty ambulatory surgery center. Want to find out how Dr. Locandro's cash pricing system works?

Following the announcement of an aggressive goal to have 30 percent of Medicare payments in alterna- tive payment models by the end of 2016 and 50 percent by the end of 2018, HHS launched the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network (Network). The Network, overseen by a third party contractor so that CMS is a participant in this effort, but not the main driv-er, will primarily work to enhance value by analyzing data for current APMs, then use that data to create common core issue approaches and implementation guides. The Academy was extremely pleased to participate in the first working session of the Network and looks forward to learning more about best practices and how best to analyze data and report on new payment models.As part of recent Academy efforts related to informing Members about alternative payment models, the HHS announcement, and the Network, Academy physician payment and quality leaders met with CMS/ Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to continue dialogue with them about the Academy's ongoing efforts to im- prove quality and reduce costs, and increas- ing otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons opportunities to participate in alternative payment models. Academy leaders have developed a good relationship with Patrick Conway, MD, MSc, Deputy Administrator for Innovation and Quality and CMS Chief Medical Officer, that has led to ongoing open dialogue with him and his CMS team members regarding important quality-related issues impacting our physician members and the patients they treat. The open door policy with Dr. Conway and his team members has allowed for several policies to move forward that benefit otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons and their patients, including CMS' The Academy was extremely pleased to participate in the first working session of the Network and looks forward to learning more about best practices and how best to analyze data and report on new payment models.

As key information, policy changes, and other issues related to alternative payment models that impact the specialty emerge; we will continue to keep Members informed via the Bulletin, HP Update, and the weekly news. NUTS AND BOLTS Meeting of the minds for ongoing dialogue On May 21, 2015, AAO\u2014HNS/F leaders met with top CMS/CMMI officials who spearheaded the recent launch of the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network. Academy participants in this critical meeting included Robert Lorenz, MD, MBA, coordinator for Practice Affairs and co-chair of the Ad Hoc Payment Model work - group; Jane T. Dillon, MD, MBA, coordinator for Socioeconomic Affairs and co-chair of the Ad Hoc Payment Model Workgroup; Lisa E. Ishii, MD, MHS, coordinator for Research and Quality Improvement and Chair for the Registry T ask Force, James C. Denneny III, MD, EVP and CEO; Jean Brereton, MBA, senior director, Research, Quality and Health Policy; Jenna Kappel, MPH, MA, director of Health Policy. During the meeting, Academy leaders discussed possible opportunities to partner with CMS in APM development by describing ways that we could improve value, decrease costs, and increase quality. CMS/CMMI was very receptive to several of the ideas and the Academy's leadership will move forward with collaborative efforts. Stay tuned to the website, HP Update, and upcoming Bulletin articles for updates: bit.ly for payment reform page. 26 JUNE 2015 AAO-HNS BULLETIN ENTNET.ORG/BULLETINUncertainty related to implemen- tation was one of the main rea- sons many providers postponed preparing for ICD-10. Now that political uncertainty has been all but eliminated, electronic health record (EHR) vendors, clearinghouses, and health plans are all moving forward with preparation for the ICD-10 transition. Otolar - yngologists in group or small practices must follow this lead and focus on preparation efforts to ensure that practice revenues will not be interrupted come October 1. ICD-10 is a few months away, what can I do to prepare? Communicate with your payers/vendors One of the most effective things you can do at this point is communicate with all payers and vendors to ensure they are prepared and ask them what you need to do to further prepare. Below is a sample list of questions to ask your payers/vendors to receive ICD-10 information that could be crucial to your practice's work-flow after October 1. (This list is just a sample and is in no way all-encompassing nor should it be interpreted as legal advice):1. Does our license with you include ICD-10 regulatory updates on a moving-forward basis after the ICD-10 go-live date of October 1? 2. Who are the ICD-10 contact people and what is their contact information? 3. What modifications to my EHR must be made to accommodate ICD-10? 4. Will there be any additional fees charged as a result of the ICD-10 upgrade? Don't get denied! Prepare now ICD-10 is a few months away. Here's what you can do to prepare 5. When will system upgrades for ICD-10 go into effect? 6. Will there be any additional training pro-vided as a result of the ICD-10 upgrade? 7. Is there a charge associated with any additional training that is required? 8. Besides system upgrades, what additional documentation and forms changes (matrices, clickable templates, etc.) will you provide? 9. When can we see updated policy/edit/ prior authorization changes for ICD-10? 10. Will system upgrades for ICD-10 require additional hardware to support the soft-ware modifications? 11. How will your products and services accommodate both ICD-9 and ICD-10 as we work with claims for services pro- vided both before and after the transition deadline for code sets? 12. What does testing mean to your organi- zation and when will we be able to test ICD-10 claims/transactions? 13. What are your post-implementation con- tingency plans to ensure accurate provid- er reimbursement? (e.g., Will you grant \"advance payments\" in the form of paper checks for risk mitigation purposes?) Improve documentation practices While you cannot submit actual ICD-10 codes and receive payment until the deadline has arrived, you can submit detailed documentation for your claims as a form of practice in antic-ipation of the deadline. Several EMR vendors allow ICD-10 coding now, so patient problem lists are being populated with both ICD-9 and corresponding ICD-10 codes. This can help get a practice acquainted with doing the ICD-10 coding, and when the switch is flipped in October, several ICD-10 codes will already be associated with established patients.

Carroll, MD, Michael J. Pitman, MD, and Norman D. Hogikyan, MD For over two decades, otolaryngologists have treated spasmodic dysphonia (SD) patients using Botulinum toxin type A (Btx A) in a multiuse fashion from FDA-approved, 100-unit vials among multiple patients. Re- cently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended against this common practice. This action jeopardizes the delivery of appropriate, life-affirming medical care to thousands of patients. This recommendation differs from the typical practice pattern of clinicians who administer the drug in a multiuse fashion. practices (the Emory V oice Center, the University of Pittsburgh V oice Center, and the University of Texas Health Science Center's V oice Center San Antonio) that all use Btx A vials in a sterile, multiuse fashion for SD: \"Directly after reconstitution, predetermined amounts of BtxA are drawn up for subject use, using a new needle to puncture the vial with separate syringes for each subject. The needle is discarded after the Btx A is drawn up. The remaining reconstituted Btx A that is not used during the clinic time is refrigerated at 4\u00baC for use the following week.\" The study also highlights that otolaryngologists are not alone in this practice by citing a recent survey of the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery. This survey assessed 1,000 physician-members regarding their dermatologic practice patterns, and experiences with single- versus multipatient-use of Btx A stating there were \"no instances of local infections ever documented by this group despite using the vials on multiple patients.\" The authors used three methods to evaluate the safety of using Btx A vials in a multiuse fashion. All subjects were given Btx A from a vial that had been used in a multiuse fashion per routine clinical practice. First, 179 patients with a collective history of 3,423 Btx A injections from the three study sites were given a paper questionnaire Another con- troversy involving the use of BtxA surrounds the manufacturer's purported decrease in effica- cy beginning four hours after resuspension of the drug. Evidence and clinical experience suggest Btx A remains effective weeks or months after the vial is initially opened, as long as it is refrigerated for future use. (Liu A, et al. A. J Am Acad Dermatol 2012;67: 373-378) A recent multi-institutional study was undertaken to explore and potentially resolve these controversies, utilizing both retrospective and prospective observational data of patients receiving Botox (Allergan Corp., Irvine CA) for spasmodic dysphonia (SD). (Barrow EM, et al. Laryngoscope. 2014 Dec 4. doi: 10.1002/lary.25068. [Epub ahead of print]) Led by senior author Michael M. Johns III MD, the authors collected data from three high-volume academic laryngology 32 JUNE 2015 AAO-HNS BULLETIN ENTNET.ORG/BULLETINat the time of their current injection asking them if they had ever experienced potential signs of infection following any past Btx A injection (pain, redness and/or swelling at the injection site, and/or fever). A final question asked if they had ever experienced an injection that did not provide effect. Of all injections given, 5.81 percent were reported to have resulted in at least one of the aforementioned findings. Most of the patient responses were swelling or redness at the injection site. Only one patient out of 179 reported a fever in the post-injection period. Failed injections were reported in 3.36 per - cent of all injections. The second method of Btx A multiuse vial safety evaluation involved a prospective phone survey of the same subjects one week after the injection was performed. In the study, 174 subjects participated with 22 (12.64 percent) experiencing pain, redness, swelling, or fever after the procedure. In total, nine (5.17 percent) experienced redness, eight (4.6 percent) experienced pain, and four (2.3 percent) had swelling at the injection site after their most recent Btx A treatment. Only one of the 174 subjects (0.57 percent) experienced fever. Finally, the Emory V oice Center per -formed a single-site, retrospective review of nearly 10 years of one-week follow-up phone survey data of injections performed using the multiuse vial technique. The 743 subjects un-derwent 6,216 Btx A injections. Not a single infection-related adverse event was identified, and there were no unscheduled clinic visits or admissions due to infection following these procedures. This study specifically demonstrates the safety of reconstituted Btx A vials to be used in a multiuse, multipatient fashion as they have been for decades, without undue concern for increased infection risk as proposed by the CDC and the manufacturer. In laryngological applications, typically for SD, very small amounts (typically 0.625 to 5 units) are used for each patient event. If used according to guidelines, more than 90 percent of the 100-unit Btx A vial would be discarded with each use resulting in enormous waste and increased expense to the healthcare system. The authors of the study also cite prior studies demonstrating the general side effects of Btx A, including nausea, malaise, flu-like symptoms, and rashes, which a patient can report following injection elsewhere in the body. Finally, other cited studies demonstrated pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site at incidences no higher than placebo. Dr. Johns' group concludes that their cohort likely experienced their symptoms due to the injection trauma itself rather than from infectious sequelae. Although not the primary focus of the study, an indirect observation on efficacy of reconstituted Btx A lasting longer than the recommended four hours was made by the authors. The clinical practice of the three study sites is to store and refrigerate the un-used portion of the vials for future use. With SD Btx A injection clinics happening weekly or biweekly at these centers, they report a 96.64 percent Btx A injection treatment effi- cacy rate. With this finding, efficacy beyond four hours is clearly demonstrated. Fur - thermore, the current study cites numerous other peer-reviewed papers that demonstrate preservation of both potency and duration of action for periods of a few weeks to six months. The authors conclude the data they present demonstrates good evidence to support the use of Btx A vials in a multiuse fashion without concern for local or systemic infection. This paper's findings, offered alongside prior studies that offer evidence in a similar strain, afford otolaryngologists another set of data to challenge the CDC and manufacturer recommendations. These recommendations, which have directed local institutional guidelines, have led to significant waste of Btx A, extra effort, and wasted time for clinicians in otolaryngology and pharmacy who must prepare the Btx A and an additional, unnecessary cost to the health system. There is currently a robust societal mandate for cost-effective healthcare, and physicians should be in the lead in defining areas where quality-based medicine can reduce costs appropriately and safely. Physicians must also take the lead when it is possible that a pharmaceutical manufacturer's policy, i.e., single- versus multiuse of a vial, may in fact be rooted in projected sales figures rather than medical efficacy or patient safety. A conversation to challenge the CDC's and manufacturer's guidelines is necessary at every institution that prevents multiuse, multipatient use of reconstituted Btx A. Although not the primary focus of the study, an indirect observation on efficacy of reconstituted Btx A lasting longer than the recommended four hours was made by the authors. The clinical practice of the three study sites is to store and refrigerate the unused portion of the vials for future use. With SD Btx A injection clinics happening weekly or biweekly at these centers, they report a 96.64 percent Btx A injection treatment efficacy rate. With this finding, efficacy beyond four hours is clearly demonstrated.

Though the condition is uncommon, it is the most common facial nerve disorder. Bell's palsy affects both men and women across a wide range of ages. The information in this summary is based on the Clinical Practice Guideline of evidence-based research to help with a more efficient diagnosis and treatment of Bell's palsy. ABOUT THE AAO-HNS The American Academy of Otolaryngology\u2014Head and Neck Surgery (www.entnet.org), one of the oldest medical associations in the nation, represents about 12,000 physicians and allied health professionals who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the ears, nose, throat, and related structures of the head and neck. The Acad- emy serves its members by facilitating the advancement of the science and art of medicine related to otolaryngology and by representing the specialty in governmental and socioeconomic issues. The AAO-HNS Foundation works to advance the art, science, and ethical practice of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery through education, research, and lifelong learning. The organization's vision: \"Empowering otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons to deliver the best patient care.\"WHAT IS BELL'S PALSY? Bell's palsy is a condition that causes the facial nerve not to work resulting in paralysis and distortions of the face. The paralysis can appear as sagging, frozen expressions, frowns, droopiness, and other surprising looks. Some patients report a typical day of waking up and feeling normal, then being shocked when looking in the mirror and seeing how one side of their face has changed. In others, Bell's palsy takes several days or even longer to fully develop, before changes in the face stop. Bell's palsy occurs when the facial nerve is damaged by pressure or swelling. The facial nerve controls the muscles of the face, the ears, the saliva glands in the mouth and tears in the eyes, and provides some of the sense of taste on the tongue. A person's facial paralysis or weakness may range from mild to severe. It may be difficult to smile or make facial expressions. Some people have a hard time eating or drinking due to the facial weakness. Other symptoms may include: facial numbness, drooling; pain around the ears, and loss of the sense of taste. Eyelids may not fully close. The face may feel heavy. YOUR DIAGNOSIS/HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE BELL'S PALSY?Bell's palsy is diagnosed in several different ways. It is important that a doctor rule out other, non-Bell's conditions that may be causing the facial paralysis or other symptoms. Your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history to decide if condi- tions such as stroke, certain tumors, Lyme disease, infection, injury/trauma, or other disorders might be causing the paralysis. Your doctor will suggest proper testing and treatment after evaluation. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist. What you can and should do: It is important to quickly seek medical attention after the onset of symptoms. Seeking quick medical care will help avoid misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis and may improve your chances of treatment. If your eyelids are not fully closing, it is very important to hydrate the eye. You can use eye ointment or eye drops to avoid any long-term harm to your sight. You should also protect your eyes. With Bell's palsy, you are more prone to scratches of the cornea, which can be prevented by wearing an eye patch. If you are in pain, seek medical advice.WHAT CAUSES BELL'S PALSY? Bell's palsy has an unknown cause. Bell's palsy occurs when the facial nerve becomes damaged, through no known fault or action of the patient. The facial nerve is believed to have been squeezed or somehow swollen by an inflammation. There is no reason why the facial nerve becomes weak or why some people are more affected than others. Some studies have found that the Bell's palsy may be related to a virus or could be a response by your body's immune system. Bell's is more common in the 15 to 45 year age group. You are at increased risk for Bell's if you are pregnant, have severe preeclampsia, are obese, have high blood pressure, diabetes, or upper respiratory ailments. WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT? WILL YOUR SYMPTOMS GET WORSE? The recovery time and the severity of symp- toms will vary among individuals. However, most people affected by Bell's palsy will recover over a period of time. In some studies, facial function is completely restored in about 70 percent of Bell's palsy patients with complete paralysis within six months, and as high as 94 percent of patients with partial paralysis. Some patients will recover in as little as a few weeks or months. There are a few others who may have some degree of long-lasting paralysis. Some patients experience different levels of severity of symptoms or additional paralysis. Bell's palsy symptoms may make some people want to limit their time with other people due to their face looking different or distorted. Other people may have symptoms that affect their speech, vision or hearing. Some people have reported feeling faint or dizzy, conditions that can interfere with their daily activities. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist for any new symptoms or if your condition worsens. WHAT TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE? Several treatment options are available to Bell's palsy patients. Some people will recover over time without seeking treatment. It is important to seek medical attention to discuss a treatment plan and avoid misdiagnosis. Some people benefit by taking prescribed oral steroids\u2014and it may help to get this treatment soon after the onset of Bell's. In the past, doctors may have prescribed antiviral drugs. It is not recommended that Bell's palsy patients who are experiencing symptoms for the first time receive antiviral drugs alone. Doctors may prescribe antiviral drugs with oral steroids. Experimental treatments in- clude electronic nerve stimulation where an electri- cal current is produced by a device to stimulate the facial nerve for muscle movement; electroneurogra- phy, which measures how well your nerves transmit signals; hyperbaric therapy, which administers high levels of oxygen; or acupuncture. There is conflicting evidence about how well some surgical and experi- mental treatments work. T alk with your doctor about risks and potential side effects with any treatment. For more details and technical information about the science\u2014and lack of science\u2014behind these different treatments, see http:/ /www.entnet.org/content/clinical-practice-guidelines WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO? If your condition does not improve over time, there are some procedures that can help reduce the effects of Bell's palsy. For instance, you can get specialized help with closing the eyelids. It is also very important that you watch your mental health and that you seek counseling or support if you feel overwhelmed by the way your face has changed. You should follow up with your doctor, should your symptoms not get better within three months or if symptoms worsen. Your doctor can review your past treatment and explore further options with you to help you treat your symptoms. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist to help with managing your symptoms. In today's world of social media, there are a number of websites with patients who are sharing life stories and pictures or videos of how they have coped\u2014often with creative humor and good spirit\u2014and how their condition has improved over time. We do not endorse any specific Bell's relat -ed website and some sites have bad information. However, you may find comfort in joining online support discussion forums. These online forums offer a place where you can learn and share with others with Bell's, who understand what you are going through. These sites can provide encour -agement, useful coping tips, and hope. Clip and copy to make available in your practice for patients. WHAT IS SWIMMER'S EARGUIDELINE PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY This plain language summary serves as an overview in explaining Acute Otitis Externa (AOE), a condition commonly known as \"swimmer's ear.\" Swimmer's ear affects both males and females across a wide range of ages. It is very common in children. Most cases happen in summer months or in warmer regions due to increased water exposure. The information in this summary is based on the 2013 update of the Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa. The guideline includes evidence- based research to support more efficient diagnosis and treatment of swimmer's ear. WHAT IS SWIMMER'S EAR? Swimmer's ear is an infection of the ear canal, which is a slender channel about one-inch long that leads from the outer ear to the eardrum. Symptoms of swimmer's ear can include pain, redness, and swelling of the ear canal and an itchy feeling in the ear. Pain when tugging the earlobe, or when chewing food, is also a symptom. Some patients report temporary hearing loss or their ears feeling \"full.\" Patients may experience symptoms differently and at different levels of severity. It is important to note that swimmer's ear is different from a middle ear infection, which is common in young children. WHAT CAUSES SWIMMER'S EAR? ARE THERE RISK FACTORS? Swimmer's ear is an infection that occurs when water remains trapped in the ear canal. This moist environment is ideal for the growth of bac- teria, and, in rare cases, fungus. Some patients get swimmer's ear from swimming, although it can happen from bathing, showering, or even sweating. A lack of earwax due to aggressive cleaning with cotton swabs or small objects can cause swimmer's ear. Earwax limits the growth of bacteria and is a natural barrier to moisture. Skin conditions such as eczema, and chemicals from hairspray or dyes, can also prompt swim- mer's ear. Stress, sweating, wearing hearing aids, and allergies have been linked to the condition as well. People swimming in pools with poor water quality are more likely to get swimmer's ear. Those living in warmer climates are also more likely to get swimmer's ear because they spend more time swimming or doing water sports. Some studies show that those with Type A blood may be at increased risk for swimmer's ear. WHAT CAN YOU DO? Seeking medical care quickly after the onset of symptoms will help avoid misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis and improve the success of treatment. Untreated swimmer's ear can be very painful and can temporarily affect hearing. If left untreated, swimmer's ear could spread beyond the ear canal, lead to a chronic infection, or even permanently damage the ear. HOW IS SWIMMER'S EAR DIAGNOSED? Swimmer's ear is diagnosed by a physical examination and medical history by a healthcare provider. A doctor may examine the ears using a device called an otoscope (pronounced oh- toe-scope), which allows for a good view inside the ear canal. By using this device, a doctor can exclude any other causes of the patient's symptoms, such as excessive ear wax or infec- tion in the middle ear. A doctor may also clean the inside of the ear canal and take a sample of drainage from the ear, if present. WHAT TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE? Swimmer's ear should be treated with prescrip- tion eardrops, which include antibiotics, steroids, or drugs that reduce inflammation. Sometimes the eardrops contain more than one medication. Swimmer's ear can be very painful, so be sure to let your doctor know if you need additional medication taken orally to relieve pain. The recovery time and severity of symptoms varies among individuals. Symptoms usually improve within two to three days and pain goes away within four to seven days, but it may take up to two weeks for the ear to feel completely normal. Patients with ear tubes, a hole in the ear -drum, diabetes, or a weak immune system may get modified treatments from their doctor. Ear candles do not help swimmer's ear and are not recommended for treatment. Studies show use of ear candles can cause more injury to the ears. HOW CAN YOU PREVENT SWIMMER'S EAR? During treatment: Patients with swimmer's ear should stay away from water for seven to 10 days during their treatment. Entering a swim- ming pool may be allowed in mild cases as long as the ears are not submerged under water. After treatment: Swimmers may return to swimming two to three days after completing treatment if the pain has gone away and they use earplugs. Inserting earplugs can help reduce additional moisture in the ear. Patients who wear hearing aids or use earphones should limit their use until pain and any discharge have stopped. Other prevention tips: Using eardrops prescribed by your doctor shortly before or after swimming, at bedtime, or in a combination of times is one way to prevent swimmer's ear. Keeping the ear canal dry after water activities can also help defend against swimmer's ear. One idea is to dry the ear by using a hair dryer on the lowest heat setting. If your symptoms do not begin to improve af -ter a few days with treatment you should inform you doctor to see if an office visit or change in medicine is necessary. A doctor can review past treatment and explore further options to treat the condition.

Tinnitus is a sensation of noise or ringing in the ears or head, when there is no real sound. Tinnitus (pronounced ten-ih-tus) affects 10-15 percent of adults in the United States. Some people experience tinnitus that goes away on its own. Other people have symptoms that last six months or longer and interfere with their life. The information in this summary is based on the 2014 Clinical Practice Guideline: Tinnitus. The guideline includes evidence-based research to support more effective diagnosis and treatment of tinnitus. WHAT IS TINNITUS? Tinnitus can be heard in one or both sides of the head. The noises can sound like they are either from within or outside the head. Tinnitus sounds can include ringing, roaring, buzzing, clicking, beating, whooshing, whistling, humming, or oth- er noises. The person may \"hear\" their tinnitus all the time, or only in certain situations. Tinnitus can hurt a person's quality of life. Patients may experience symptoms at different levels of severity. Common patient complaints include difficulty sleeping, struggling to understand oth- er's speech, depression, and problems focusing. These experiences could lead to problems with both work and family life. WHAT CAUSES TINNITUS? ARE THERE RISK FACTORS? There are two types of tinnitus: primary and sec- ondary. Primary tinnitus has an unknown cause. It may or may not be linked with hearing loss. Secondary tinnitus has a specific known cause. It may be such things like impacted earwax, or diseases or pressure behind the eardrum. Sec- ondary tinnitus can also be related to Meniere's disease or ear nerve conditions. Tinnitus can be caused by more unusual or serious conditions. Some of these rare conditions include tumors, heart problems, or blood vessel problems. Tinnitus can be seen at any age, in males or females, and in all ethnic groups. Tinnitus occurs more frequently in males, the elderly, and non-Hispanic whites. There is a higher rate of tinnitus among military veterans. Tinnitus is also more likely to occur in people who are over - weight, obese, or who have high blood pressure. Other risk factors include diabetes, high choles- terol, or anxiety disorder. Tinnitus is believed to be linked to long-term noise exposure. Exposure to noise, such as firearms or loud music, is also a risk factor. WHAT CAN YOU DO? You should seek medical care after you notice symptoms, which may help avoid misdiagno- sis or delayed diagnosis. Tinnitus can be very upsetting, and it can even be associated with depression and anxiety. T ell your doctor if you are having a strong emotional response to your tinnitus. Tinnitus patients commonly have trouble sleeping (insomnia). Lack of sleep can reduce the ability to pay attention. It can also lead to anger, frustration, and other negative emotions. Some patients develop a fear of being in noisy places. It is important to tell your doctor if symptoms are affecting your daily life. HOW IS TINNITUS DIAGNOSED? A doctor can diagnose tinnitus by reviewing your medical history and performing a physical exam. The examination may rule out other conditions. A doctor may look in the ears using a device called an otoscope (pronounced oh-toe-scope). This device allows for a good view inside the ear canal. Your doctor may also find other treatable conditions that are causing tinnitus. For example, earwax that is obstructing the ear canal can be removed. Fluid behind the eardrum can also be treated. Tinnitus frequently occurs in patients with hearing loss. Hearing tests are often done for people who have tinnitus. WHAT TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE? Tinnitus may improve on its own, especially when it is mild and has lasted for less than six months. When treatment is needed, patients benefit from individualized treatments to help manage their symptoms. Hearing aids can improve a patient's quality of life by correcting any hearing loss. Hearing aids can also make the tinnitus less noticeable. Patients who have upsetting tinnitus may benefit from counsel- ing and/ or medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a form of psychotherapy that may be helpful for patients trying to cope with upsetting tinnitus. Sound therapy is sometimes a good option. Smart phones, CD players, MP3 players, and radios can be used for sound therapy. Studies show that products such as Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, or zinc do not help patients with tinnitus. Therefore, these types of over-the-counter products are not recommended for treatment. Research shows that ear medications injected through the eardrum do not improve tinnitus. Studies also prove that treatments with magnetic stimulation do not improve the tinnitus. Therefore, these treatments are not recommended. There is not enough evidence to either recommend or discourage using acupunc- ture for treating tinnitus. WHERE CAN I FIND HELP? Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease. There are a number of options that can be offered for your relief. Your doctor can provide information brochures and can suggest self-help books. Also, your doctor can describe counseling and therapy options to you. Your doctor can also explain how medication manages the problem. You may also be referred to support associations and specialists. This plain language summary was developed from the 2014 AAO-HNSF Clinical Practice Guideline: Tinnitus.

The organization's vision: \"Empowering otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons to deliver the best patient care.\"WHAT IS BELL'S PALSY? Bell's palsy is a condition that causes the facial nerve not to work resulting in paralysis and distortions of the face. The paralysis can appear as sagging, frozen expressions, frowns, droopiness, and other surprising looks. Some patients report a typical day of waking up and feeling normal, then being shocked when looking in the mirror and seeing how one side of their face has changed. In others, Bell's palsy takes several days or even longer to fully develop, before changes in the face stop. Bell's palsy occurs when the facial nerve is damaged by pressure or swelling. The facial nerve controls the muscles of the face, the ears, the saliva glands in the mouth and tears in the eyes, and provides some of the sense of taste on the tongue. A person's facial paralysis or weakness may range from mild to severe. It may be difficult to smile or make facial expressions. Some people have a hard time eating or drinking due to the facial weakness. Other symptoms may include: facial numbness, drooling; pain around the ears, and loss of the sense of taste. Eyelids may not fully close. The face may feel heavy. YOUR DIAGNOSIS/HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE BELL'S PALSY?Bell's palsy is diagnosed in several different ways. It is important that a doctor rule out other, non-Bell's conditions that may be causing the facial paralysis or other symptoms. Y our doctor will review your symptoms and medical history to decide if condi-tions such as stroke, certain tumors, Lyme disease, infection, injury/trauma, or other disorders might be causing the paralysis. Y our doctor will suggest proper testing and treatment after evaluation. Y our doctor may refer you to a specialist. What you can and should do: It is important to quickly seek medical attention after the onset of symptoms. Seeking quick medical care will help avoid misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis and may improve your chances of treatment. If your eyelids are not fully closing, it is very important to hydrate the eye. Y ou can use eye ointment or eye drops to avoid any long-term harm to your sight. Y ou should also protect your eyes. With Bell's palsy, you are more prone to scratches of the cornea, which can be prevented by wearing an eye patch. If you are in pain, seek medical advice.WHAT CAUSES BELL'S PALSY?Bell's palsy has an unknown cause. Bell's palsy occurs when the facial nerve becomes damaged, through no known fault or action of the patient. The facial nerve is believed to have been squeezed or somehow swollen by an inflammation. There is no reason why the facial nerve becomes weak or why some people are more affected than others. Some studies have found that the Bell's palsy may be related to a virus or could be a response by your body's immune system. Bell's is more common in the 15 to 45 year age group. Y ou are at increased risk for Bell's if you are pregnant, have severe preeclampsia, are obese, have high blood pressure, diabetes, or upper respiratory ailments. WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT? WILL YOUR SYMPTOMS GET WORSE?The recovery time and the severity of symp-toms will vary among individuals. However, most people affected by Bell's palsy will recover over a period of time. In some studies, facial function is completely restored in about 70 percent of Bell's palsy patients with complete paralysis within six months, and as high as 94 percent of patients with partial paralysis. Some patients will recover in as little as a few weeks or months. There are a few others who may have some degree of long-lasting paralysis. Some patients experience different levels of severity of symptoms or additional paralysis. Bell's palsy symptoms may make some people want to limit their time with other people due to their face looking different or distorted. Other people may have symptoms that affect their speech, vision or hearing. Some people have reported feeling faint or dizzy, conditions that can interfere with their daily activities. Y our doctor may refer you to a specialist for any new symptoms or if your condition worsens. WHAT TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE? Several treatment options are available to Bell's palsy patients. Some people will recover over time without seeking treatment. It is important to seek medical attention to discuss a treatment plan and avoid misdiagnosis. Some people benefit by taking prescribed oral steroids\u2014and it may help to get this treatment soon after the onset of Bell's. In the past, doctors may have prescribed antiviral drugs. It is not recommended that Bell's palsy patients who are experiencing symptoms for the first time receive antiviral drugs alone. Doctors may prescribe antiviral drugs with oral steroids. Experimental treatments in-clude electronic nerve stimulation where an electri-cal current is produced by a device to stimulate the facial nerve for muscle movement; electroneurogra-phy, which measures how well your nerves transmit signals; hyperbaric therapy, which administers high levels of oxygen; or acupuncture. There is conflicting evidence about how well some surgical and experi-mental treatments work. T alk with your doctor about risks and potential side effects with any treatment. For more details and technical information about the science\u2014and lack of science\u2014behind these different treatments, see http:/ /www.entnet.org/content/ clinical-practice-guidelines WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO? If your condition does not improve over time, there are some procedures that can help reduce the effects of Bell's palsy. For instance, you can get specialized help with closing the eyelids. It is also very important that you watch your mental health and that you seek counseling or support if you feel overwhelmed by the way your face has changed. Y ou should follow up with your doctor, should your symptoms not get better within three months or if symptoms worsen. Y our doctor can review your past treatment and explore further options with you to help you treat your symptoms. Y our doctor may refer you to a specialist to help with managing your symptoms. In today's world of social media, there are a number of websites with patients who are sharing life stories and pictures or videos of how they have coped\u2014often with creative humor and good spirit\u2014and how their condition has improved over time. We do not endorse any specific Bell's relat - ed website and some sites have bad information. However, you may find comfort in joining online support discussion forums. These online forums offer a place where you can learn and share with others with Bell's, who understand what you are going through. These sites can provide encour - agement, useful coping tips, and hope.

It is very common in children. Most cases happen in summer months or in warmer regions due to increased water exposure. The information in this summary is based on the 2013 update of the Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa. The guideline includes evidence- based research to support more efficient diagnosis and treatment of swimmer's ear. WHAT IS SWIMMER'S EAR? Swimmer's ear is an infection of the ear canal, which is a slender channel about one-inch long that leads from the outer ear to the eardrum. Symptoms of swimmer's ear can include pain, redness, and swelling of the ear canal and an itchy feeling in the ear. Pain when tugging the earlobe, or when chewing food, is also a symptom. Some patients report temporary hearing loss or their ears feeling \"full.\" Patients may experience symptoms differently and at different levels of severity. It is important to note that swimmer's ear is different from a middle ear infection, which is common in young children. WHAT CAUSES SWIMMER'S EAR? ARE THERE RISK FACTORS?Swimmer's ear is an infection that occurs when water remains trapped in the ear canal. This moist environment is ideal for the growth of bac-teria, and, in rare cases, fungus. Some patients get swimmer's ear from swimming, although it can happen from bathing, showering, or even sweating. A lack of earwax due to aggressive cleaning with cotton swabs or small objects can cause swimmer's ear. Earwax limits the growth of bacteria and is a natural barrier to moisture. Skin conditions such as eczema, and chemicals from hairspray or dyes, can also prompt swim-mer's ear. Stress, sweating, wearing hearing aids, and allergies have been linked to the condition as well. People swimming in pools with poor water quality are more likely to get swimmer's ear. Those living in warmer climates are also more likely to get swimmer's ear because they spend more time swimming or doing water sports. Some studies show that those with T ype A blood may be at increased risk for swimmer's ear. WHAT CAN YOU DO? Seeking medical care quickly after the onset of symptoms will help avoid misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis and improve the success of treatment. Untreated swimmer's ear can be very painful and can temporarily affect hearing. If left untreated, swimmer's ear could spread beyond the ear canal, lead to a chronic infection, or even permanently damage the ear. HOW IS SWIMMER'S EAR DIAGNOSED? Swimmer's ear is diagnosed by a physical examination and medical history by a healthcare provider. A doctor may examine the ears using a device called an otoscope (pronounced oh-toe-scope), which allows for a good view inside the ear canal. By using this device, a doctor can exclude any other causes of the patient's symptoms, such as excessive ear wax or infec-tion in the middle ear. A doctor may also clean the inside of the ear canal and take a sample of drainage from the ear, if present. WHAT TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE? Swimmer's ear should be treated with prescrip-tion eardrops, which include antibiotics, steroids, or drugs that reduce inflammation. Sometimes the eardrops contain more than one medication. Swimmer's ear can be very painful, so be sure to let your doctor know if you need additional medication taken orally to relieve pain. The recovery time and severity of symptoms varies among individuals. Symptoms usually improve within two to three days and pain goes away within four to seven days, but it may take up to two weeks for the ear to feel completely normal. Patients with ear tubes, a hole in the ear - drum, diabetes, or a weak immune system may get modified treatments from their doctor. Ear candles do not help swimmer's ear and are not recommended for treatment. Studies show use of ear candles can cause more injury to the ears. HOW CAN YOU PREVENT SWIMMER'S EAR? During treatment: Patients with swimmer's ear should stay away from water for seven to 10 days during their treatment. Entering a swim-ming pool may be allowed in mild cases as long as the ears are not submerged under water.After treatment: Swimmers may return to swimming two to three days after completing treatment if the pain has gone away and they use earplugs. Inserting earplugs can help reduce additional moisture in the ear. Patients who wear hearing aids or use earphones should limit their use until pain and any discharge have stopped.Other prevention tips: Using eardrops prescribed by your doctor shortly before or after swimming, at bedtime, or in a combination of times is one way to prevent swimmer's ear. Keeping the ear canal dry after water activities can also help defend against swimmer's ear. One idea is to dry the ear by using a hair dryer on the lowest heat setting. If your symptoms do not begin to improve af - ter a few days with treatment you should inform you doctor to see if an office visit or change in medicine is necessary. A doctor can review past treatment and explore further options to treat the condition.

Tinnitus is a sensation of noise or ringing in the ears or head, when there is no real sound. Tinnitus (pronounced ten-ih-tus) affects 10-15 percent of adults in the United States. Some people experience tinnitus that goes away on its own. Other people have symptoms that last six months or longer and interfere with their life. The information in this summary is based on the 2014 Clinical Practice Guideline: Tinnitus. The guideline includes evidence-based research to support more effective diagnosis and treatment of tinnitus. WHAT IS TINNITUS? Tinnitus can be heard in one or both sides of the head. The noises can sound like they are either from within or outside the head. Tinnitus sounds can include ringing, roaring, buzzing, clicking, beating, whooshing, whistling, humming, or oth-er noises. The person may \"hear\" their tinnitus all the time, or only in certain situations. Tinnitus can hurt a person's quality of life. Patients may experience symptoms at different levels of severity. Common patient complaints include difficulty sleeping, struggling to understand oth-er's speech, depression, and problems focusing. These experiences could lead to problems with both work and family life. WHAT CAUSES TINNITUS? ARE THERE RISK FACTORS?There are two types of tinnitus: primary and sec-ondary. Primary tinnitus has an unknown cause. It may or may not be linked with hearing loss. Secondary tinnitus has a specific known cause. It may be such things like impacted earwax, or diseases or pressure behind the eardrum. Sec-ondary tinnitus can also be related to Meniere's disease or ear nerve conditions. Tinnitus can be caused by more unusual or serious conditions. Some of these rare conditions include tumors, heart problems, or blood vessel problems. Tinnitus can be seen at any age, in males or females, and in all ethnic groups. Tinnitus occurs more frequently in males, the elderly, and non-Hispanic whites.

Statements are created to formalize the AAO-HNS/F position on a clinical procedure or medical service with third-party payers, for use in state and federal regulatory or advocacy efforts, or to clarify the AAO-HNS/F approval or disapproval of certain practices in medicine. Robert Lorenz, MD, MBA, Coordinator for Practice Affairs and Physician Payment Policy (3P) Workgroup Co-Chair, provides oversight on the development and maintenance of pro- grams that support the services our physicians provide to patients, including the AAO-HNS/F Position Statements, which are reviewed every four years. There are a total of 73 active position statements with 21 last updated in December 2012 and scheduled for review this fall. As part of each committee's charge, it is essential that the relevant AAO-HNS/F clinical committees review the Position Statements to ensure they are updated and relevant. The relevant committee chairs and staff liaisons will receive the Position Statements they are responsible for reviewing by August 2015 so that there is ample time for the review process, and the committees may opt to discuss the position statements under review at the Acade- my's Annual Meeting and OTO EXPO SM. Committees will receive a four-month time frame to review assigned statements with addi-tional time given to those committees with more than three statements assigned. The committee will be asked to review, deliberate, and decide among three options: 1) delete the position state-ment because it is outdated or no longer serves a valid purpose; 2) reaffirm the position statement as written with zero changes; or 3) revise the position statement and draft a track-changes ver - sion of the original statement, clearly reflecting specific proposed changes along with rationale for the revisions. Committees are encouraged to assign two or three committee members to review the statement, submit their recommen-dations to the entire committee, and reach a consensus recommendation with supporting rationale that the staff liaison can submit to the 3P Workgroup for review and approval. Recommendations for new Position Statements by the committees may also be considered on an ongoing basis. (See www.entnet.org/ sites/ default/files/PositionStatement T emplateandDevelopmentProcess.pdf for guidance on creating a new position statement.) Pending 3P approval, the Position Statements are reviewed and approved by the AAO-HNS Boards of Directors Spring or Fall 2016 meeting for final approval.
