The Defense Health Program (DHP) Operation and Maintenance (O&M) appropriation funding provides for worldwide medical and dental services to active forces and other eligible beneficiaries, veterinary services, occupational and industrial health care, specialized services for the training of medical personnel, and medical command headquarters. Included are costs associated with the delivery of the TRICARE benefit which provides for the health care of eligible active duty family members, retired members and their family members, and the eligible surviving family members of deceased active duty and retired members. The FY 2015 budget request of $31,994.9 million includes realistic cost growth for health care services either provided in the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) or purchased from the private sector through the managed care support contracts, and for pharmaceuticals. This budget includes funding for continued support of Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health (TBI/PH) and Wounded, Ill and Injured (WII) requirements. It complies with the Congressional mandate related to support of Centers of Excellence (COE) and Department of Defense's initiative for operations efficiencies, including assumed savings for proposed military healthcare reform initiatives. Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding is divided into seven major areas: In-House Care, Private Sector Care, Information Management, Education and Training, Management Activities, Consolidated Health Support, and Base Operations. The DoD Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund (MERHCF) is an accrual fund to pay for DoD's share of applicable Direct Care and Private Sector Care operation and maintenance health care costs for Medicare-eligible retirees, retiree family members and survivors. The DHP appropriation also funds the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) program for medical Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT), medical research to reduce capability gaps, support to continental United States and (CONUS) and outside of continuous United States (OCONUS) medical laboratory facilities, and the Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute (AFRRI).

Narrative Explanation of FY 2014 and FY 2015 Procurement Changes: Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Budget Estimates Defense Health Program Appropriation Highlights Exhibit PBA-19, Appropriation Highlights (Page 7 of 11) The DHP Procurement Program has a net decrease of $133.4 million between FY 2014 and FY 2015. This consists of $12.4 million in price growth and decreased program growth of $145.8 million. Program increases include: $45.7 million for various IM/IT equipment purchases, Military Treatment Facility (MTF) Communications requirements - Local Area Network (LAN), and Health Artifact and Image Management Solution (HAIMS). $32.9 million associated with the transfer of responsibilities for the new IT initiative from the Program Executive Office Defense Healthcare Management Systems (PEO DHMS) to the Defense Health Agency (DHA). $9.2 million in additional funding to address a refined information technology mission focused on data interoperability, implementation of national health data standards for the seamless integrated sharing of electronic health data between the DoD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and other health partners. $2.1 million investment related to the consolidation of the DHA Shared Services Health Information Technology (HIT) Portfolio initiative.

The following reductions are related to Departmental initiatives: Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Budget Estimates Defense Health Program Appropriation Highlights Exhibit PBA-19, Appropriation Highlights (Page 8 of 11) - $65.0 million reduction in medical equipment Replacement and Modernization (R&M). - $43.0 million reduction in non-medical programs for Initial Outfitting Equipment (IO&T). - $30.0 million reduction in medical programs for IO&T. - $16.0 million reduction in non-medical equipment R&M. $1.7 million in various smaller enhancements/realignments (these are the net of increases and decreases). President's Management Plan - Performance Metrics Requirements: The DHP continues to refine existing performance measures and develop specific criterion to determine and measure outputs/outcomes as compared with initial goals. The Quadruple Aim is focused on a balanced approach to overall performance to include not only production but outcome measures related to medical readiness, a healthy population, positive patient experiences and responsible management of health care costs. Individual Medical Readiness - This measure provides operational commanders, Military Department leaders and primary care managers the ability to monitor the medical readiness status of their personnel, ensuring a healthy and fit fighting force medically ready to deploy. This represents the best-available indicator of the medical readiness of the Total Force, Active Components and Reserve Components prior to deployment. Beneficiary Satisfaction with Health Plan - An increase in the satisfaction with the Health Plan indicates that actions being taken are improving the overall functioning of the plan from the beneficiary perspective. Improvements represent positive patient experiences with the health care benefit and services they receive through the system. The goal is to improve overall satisfaction level to that of civilian plans using a standard survey instrument. Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Budget Estimates Defense Health Program Appropriation Highlights Exhibit PBA-19, Appropriation Highlights (Page 9 of 11) Medical Cost Per Member Per Year - Annual Cost Growth - The medical cost per member per year looks at the overall cost of the Prime enrollees for the DHP. This tracks all costs related to care delivered to enrollees. The objective is to keep the rate of cost growth for the treatment of TRICARE enrollees to a level at or below the Civilian health care plans rate increases at the national level. Currently the measure provides insight to issues regarding unit cost, utilization management, and Purchased care management. The metric has been enhanced to properly account for differences in population demographics and health care requirements of the enrolled population. Since enrollment demographics can vary significantly by Service, and across time, it is important to adjust the measure. For example, as increasing numbers of older individuals enroll, the overall average medical expense per enrollee would likely increase. Conversely, as younger, healthy active duty enroll, the overall average would likely decrease. Through the use of adjustment factors, a comparison across Services and across time is made more meaningful. Output related measures that influence Medical Cost Per Member Per Year: Inpatient Production Target (Medicare Severity Adjusted Relative Weighted Products, referred to as MS-RWPs) - Achieving the production targets ensures that the initial plan for allocation of personnel and resources are used appropriately in the production of inpatient workload. Outpatient Production Target (Relative Value Units, referred to as RVUs) - Achieving the production targets ensures that the initial plans for allocation of personnel and resources are used appropriately in the production of outpatient workload. Below is reporting for FY 2013 related to the prior performance measure goals. The next reporting period will focus on the measures related to the Quadruple Aim, and two output measures related to production plan targets. The overall success of each area measured is discussed below along with information related to continuation of reporting in future documents: Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Budget Estimates Defense Health Program Appropriation Highlights Exhibit PBA-19, Appropriation Highlights (Page 10 of 11) Individual Medical Readiness - The Military Health System achieved the goal for the Total Force Medical Readiness for FY 2013 with a score of 85% compared to the goal of 83%. This is the first time the MHS has reported this high of an overall performance level for the measure, and will have to take significant steps to ensure that performance can be sustained. Overall one of the major reasons for the improvement is focused Guard and Reserve health care where performance continued increasing an additional 5% from the prior year. This measure will continue to be reported in support of the Quadruple Aim. Beneficiary Satisfaction with Health Plan - Satisfaction with Health Care Plan performance for FY 2013 exceeded the goal of 57 percent during each quarter for the year, with an aggregate score of 66 percent for the first three quarters of the year. Fourth quarter data is missing due to the sequestration. Continuous increases in enrollment and improvement in the score demonstrates real progress for the program with respect to satisfying our beneficiaries. While progress on this metric demonstrates program success, changes to the number of individuals covered by the TRICARE Prime benefit over the next couple of years may result in a decreased overall satisfaction with the Health Plan. This measure will continue to be reported in support of the Quadruple Aim. Inpatient Production Target (MS-RWPs) - For the most recent reported monthly data for FY 2013, the MHS produced 209 thousand MS-RWPs against a target of 225 thousand MS-RWPs slightly below the target. These numbers are based on the records reported to date, and will increase slightly as all records are completed. With the continued focus on early ambulatory care to prevent inpatient admissions, there was a drop in the overall inpatient utilization from prior years. Additionally, with the consolidation of inpatient services in the National Capital Region, there is a temporary decrease in inpatient workload for the year. While the overall production for the year started strong compared to the prior year, the implementation of the furloughs under sequestration, caused the workload for the last months of the year to fall below the prior year's performance. The expectation going into FY 2014 is this reduction is only temporary and will be overcome through improved performance Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Budget Estimates Defense Health Program Appropriation Highlights Exhibit PBA-19, Appropriation Highlights (Page 11 of 11) during the year. This measure will continue to be reported as an output measure for the DHP. Outpatient Production Target (RVUs) - With an increased emphasis on paying for performance, the system has seen a renewed focus on production of outpatient care. For FY 2013, the system produced 83 million relative value units versus a goal of 80 million relative value units. The MHS achieved the goal for the year, and expects continued improvements in the coming years. This measure will continue to be reported as an output measure for the DHP. Medical Cost Per Member Per Year - Annual Cost Growth - The Year to Date performance estimate for FY 2013 is 2.8% vs goal of 5.0%. While final claims data are still lagging, the system was able to achieve the goal during the fiscal year. A significant reason for keeping the low growth rates is related to the lack of salary inflation increases for Department civilian employees, as well very limited inflationary growth for Military. Additionally, while utilization increased slightly, it remains below the utilization growth rates experienced in the past. The MHS continues to see improvements related to changes made with respect to the outpatient prospective payments in Purchased Care and Patient Centered Medical Home within Direct Care. The expectation is that the improvements should continue into FY 2014 where the measure will continue to be reported. 0130D Defense Health ProgramFY 20131/ FY 2015 Request Base + OCO Base OCO Total Base BUDGET ACTIVITY 01: OPERATION & MAINTENANCE 0130D 010 In-House are 30,642,974 32,690,271 33,588,972 31,994,918 Transfer to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the Captain James A.

(Please include any staffing data to support your explanation, such as number and duration of unfilled positions and number of accessions and separations per fiscal year.) Because of the use of PCA we were able to retain our current workforce. Without PCA our losses, other than normal attrition would have increased and impacted our ability to accomplish our mission. PCA allows for competitive compensation packages. Furlough and the hiring freeze had more impact on gains and losses. 11)Provide any additional information that may be useful in planning PCA staffing levels and amounts in your agency. Because of PDPP PCA use has been reduced to a minimal level. Sequestration may also reduce use and need for PCA if reductions in workforce and structure are mandated for FY 2014 and into the future.

Funds identified in this submission support the acquisition of equipment for facilities in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and National Capital Region (NCR) Medical Directorate. Those facilities range from sophisticated tertiary care medical centers to outpatient and dental clinics and physiological training units. This equipment is essential to provide high quality Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Budget Estimates Procurement Exhibit P-1, Procurement Program DHP-2health care services that meet accepted standards of practice. The required safety standards, related laws and regulatory requirements from credentialing and health care standard setting organizations influence and affect the requirement for, cost of, and replacement and modernization of medical equipment. Without the identified resources, the DHP's capability to meet the Department's medical equipment requirements will be severely degraded. The Department, through the DHP, procures a wide variety of medical items ranging from surgical, radiographic, and pathologic apparatus to medical administrative support equipment. The items to be procured by the resources identified in this schedule are selected by way of a thorough investment equipment justification process. The identification and justification process begins at the medical treatment facility (MTF) level. From there, the requirements are reviewed by functional specialty advisor groups (Surgeon General level), medical logistics experts (Service component), Health Care Support Offices (geographically oriented), and ultimately the Defense Health Council (Tri-Service level). At each level, the requirements are reviewed for the necessity, value, and utility of investment. Development of an effective equipment replacement and modernization program is a complicated process. In comparison to equipment in other functional areas, the useful life of medical equipment is short. As the current inventory reaches obsolescence, replacements are generally more sophisticated, technologically advanced, and expensive. To ensure that the Department is procuring the appropriate technology for deployment in the most useful locations, the DHP incorporates functional expertise from each echelon of the Department's medical structure into the budget development process. This submission represents a balanced, resource constrained approach to the DHP's investment equipment requirements. The needs fulfilled by the DHP's procurement budget are diverse. They are used to replace the aging real property support system in existing facilities. Also they are used for medical information system implementation, initial training, software purchases and hardware replacements, such as servers and End User Devise (EUDs). The Theater Medical Information Program - Joint (TMIP-J) integrates components of the Military Health System sustaining base systems and the Services\u00b4 medical information systems to ensure timely interoperable medical support for mobilization, deployment and sustainment of all Theater and deployed forces in support of any mission. Funding will be used for implementation and training. The former joint DoD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program has been restructured within the DoD to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program and the DoD iEHR program. The iEHR funding will acquire Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Budget Estimates Procurement Exhibit P-1, Procurement Program DHP-3infrastructure and data interoperability capability to securely and reliably exchange standardized, normalized, and correlated health data with all partners through standard data / information exchange mechanisms. Information Technology Deployment and Sustainment - DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM)) will acquire and support deployment, and implementation of a commercial electronic health record system (EHRS) that replaces DoD legacy Military Health System (MHS) clinical systems including but not limited to Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA), Clinical Information System (CIS), Composite Heath Care System (CHCS), and the EHR component of the Theater Medical Information Program (TMIP).Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Budget Estimates Procurement Exhibit P-40, Budget Item Justification, Procurement Program DHP-1BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION DATE: March 2014 APPROPRIATION / BUDGET ACTIVITY : 97*0130 P-1 NOMENCLATURE: Replacement/Modernization EstimateFY 2017 EstimateFY 2018 EstimateFY significant medical equipment investments will be in the radiographic, surgical, and information systems functional areas. The driving factors are rapid technological advancements in these areas and the need for DoD's health care delivery system to maintain the standards of care set by the civilian health care sector. Procurement investments for information systems will cover software license acquisitions, infrastructure, hardware replacement such as End User Devices, LAN upgrades and servers supporting Military Health Systems IM/IT which is composed of the centrally-managed IM/IT program (Tri-Service component), three Military Departments (MilDep) medical IM/IT components, Defense Health Agency (DHA Comptroller) IM/IT, and the National Capital Region Medical (NCR) IM/IT. Funding will also support deployment of the Wounded, Ill, Injured (WII) Health Artifact and Image Management Solution (HAIMS). Financing an adequate equipment acquisition budget is critical in retaining the Department's medical workload in-house and controlling escalating purchased healthcare O&M costs in the private sector. The items supported by this budget are the result of an extensive investment equipment justification process and are necessary to provide properly trained medical department personnel and high quality, cost effective health care services for the eligible beneficiary population.Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Budget Estimates Procurement Exhibit P-40, Budget Item Justification, Procurement Program DHP-2BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION DATE: March 2014 APPROPRIATION / BUDGET ACTIVITY : 97*0130 P-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE: New Facility Outfitting EstimateFY 2017 EstimateFY 2018 EstimateFY outfitting program element of the DHP's procurement budget funds the acquisition and installation of commercially available equipment to furnish new and expanded facilities being completed under military construction projects in support of dental services, health care delivery, health care training, and other health care activities.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), this program element supports basic medical research at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). It facilitates the recruitment and retention of faculty; supports unique research training for military medical students and resident fellows; and allows the University's faculty researchers to collect pilot data towards military relevant medical research projects in order to secure research funds from extramural sources (estimated $127 million annually). Approximately 130 intramural research projects are active each year, including 37 faculty start-ups. Projects are funded on a peer-reviewed, competitive basis. Results from these studies contribute to the fund of knowledge intended to enable technical approaches and investment strategies within Defense Science and Technology (S&T) programs. The ILIR program at USUHS is designed to answer fundamental questions of importance to the military medical mission of the Department of Defense in the areas of Infectious Disease, Military Operational Medicine, Combat Casualty Care, and Chemical, Biological, and Radiologic Defense. The portfolio of research projects will vary annually because this research is investigator-initiated. Examples of typical research efforts are detailed in R-2a. Infectious Disease: Immunology and molecular biology of bacterial, viral and parasitic disease threats to military operations. These threats include Bartonella bacilliformis, Clostridium difficile, Medicine: Sustainment of individual performance; mapping and managing deployment and operational stressors; cognitive enhancement; and military and medical training readiness. Combat Casualty Care: Ischemia and reperfusion injury, traumatic brain and peripheral nerve injury, neural control of pain, endotoxic shock, cryotherapy, malignant hyperthermia, inflammation, and wound healing.

Project funding was divided into basic science, applied research, technology development and concept advanced development efforts. A key priority of the TBI/PH research program is to complement ongoing DoD efforts to ensure the health and readiness of our military forces by promoting a better standard of care for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and TBI in the areas of prevention, detection, diagnosis (identification of the nature and cause of an illness), treatment, and rehabilitation. Program announcements, programmatic reviews, Service-requested nominations, and ongoing studies that would benefit from program acceleration have been incorporated to address these priorities and gather proposals. In the area of TBI, researchers performed investigations to find a universally-agreed upon concussion grading system, and continued experiments into the effects of penetrating injuries on the brain and experiments on the effects of blasts on the brain. Proposals were solicited in the areas of blast- induced hyper-acceleration upon the generation of TBI and the role of inflammation in spreading TBI damage. In addition, a new Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) neurotrauma consortium program announcement was released to form a five-year, multi-university consortium to discover mechanisms of treatment and the long-term effects of TBI and its relationship to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease diagnosed properly after death in patients with a history of multiple concussions. Multiple awards relevant to combat casualty care were made including development of a large animal model of penetrating ballistic brain injury and development of metrics to define concussion and grade TBI.

Preventing blunt trauma injury is one of the critical components of body armor design. For the Army Medical Command and the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, the Underbody Blast (UBB) Testing medical research project provides funds to establish a scientific and statistical basis for evaluating skeletal injuries to vehicle occupants during ground vehicle UBB events. Areas of interest to the Secretary of Defense are medical research that provides an understanding of the human response and tolerance limits and injury mechanisms needed to accurately predict skeletal injuries to ground combat vehicle occupants caused by UBB events. This enhanced understanding will support the establishment of an improved capability to conduct Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation and to make acquisition decisions. For the Army Medical Command, beginning in FY14, Military Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Research Program funding is transferred from the Army to the Defense Health Program. This project funds research to develop candidate HIV vaccines, to assess their safety and effectiveness in human subjects, and to protect military personnel from risks associated with HIV infection. For the Army Medical Command, the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB) Deployed Warfighter Protection project provides for the development of new or improved protection of ground forces from disease-carrying insects. For the Army Medical Command, four Centers of Excellence (CoE) receive medical technology development funds. The Breast Cancer Center of Excellence (Army) provides a multidisciplinary approach as the standard of care for treating breast diseases and breast cancer. The Gynecologic Center of Excellence (Army) focuses on characterizing the molecular alterations associated with benign and malignant gynecologic disease and facilitates the development of novel early detection, prevention and biologic therapeutics (a medicinal preparation created by a biological process used to treat diseases) for the management of gynecologic disease. The Cardiac Health Center of Excellence (Army) provides evidence-based personalized patient engagement approaches for comprehensive cardiac (pertaining to the heart) event prevention through education, outcomes research and technology tools, as well as molecular research to detect cardiovascular (CV) (pertaining to the heart and blood vessels) disease at an early stage to ultimately discover a signature for CV health, to find new genes that significantly increase risk for heart attack in Service members and other beneficiaries, and identify molecular markers of obesity and weight loss. The Pain Center of Excellence (Army) examines the relationship between acute (rapid onset and/or short course) and chronic (persistent or long-lasting, usually longer than 3 months) pain and focuses on finding, implementing, and evaluating the most effective methods of relieving the acute pain caused by combat trauma and the effect this has throughout the continuum to rehabilitation and reintegration. In FY15, the Pain CoE funding line is transferred from Army to USUHS. In FY13, DHP funded the following Congressional Special Interest (CSI) peer-reviewed directed research: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (degenerative neuronal disorder that causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body), Autism, Bone Marrow Failure Disease, Ovarian Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) (disease that affects the brain and the spinal cord and causes severe physical and mental complications), Cancer, Lung Cancer, Orthopedic Research, Spinal Cord Research, Vision, Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health (TBI/PH), Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Gulf War Illness, Alcohol and Substance Use Disorders, Medical Research, Alzheimer Research, Joint Warfighter Medical Research, Global HIV/AIDS Prevention, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (rare multi-system genetic disease that causes growth of non-malignant tumors in the brain and other vital organs), Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (gene mutation affecting approximately 1 in 3600 boys that causes Volume 1 - 57UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603115HP: Medical Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 4 of 76 R-1 Line #6Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2015 Defense Health Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0603115HP / Medical Technology Development muscle degeneration and eventual death), and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Comprehensive Cancer Center. Because of the CSI annual structure, out-year funding is not programmed. For the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, this program element includes funds for research management support costs. The Outside Continental US (OCONUS) laboratories conduct focused medical research on vaccine development for Malaria, Diarrhea Diseases, and Dengue Fever. In addition to entomology, HIV studies, surveillance and outbreak response under the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) program and risk assessment studies on a number of other infectious diseases that are present in the geographical regions where the laboratories are located. The CONUS laboratories conduct research on Military Operational Medicine, Combat Casualty Care, Diving and Submarine Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Environmental and Occupational Health, Directed Energy, and Aviation Medicine and Human Performance. For the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS), funding in this program element supports the Air Force Surgeon General's vision for \"Trusted Care Anywhere\" through a robust research and development program. Medical development programs are divided into five primary thrust areas: Enroute care, Expeditionary Medicine, Operational Medicine (in-garrison care), Force Health Protection (FHP) (detect, prevent, threats), and Human Performance. Expeditionary Medicine is focused on care on the battlefield and in field hospitals prior to transporting patients out of theater to CONUS, and studies trauma resuscitation, hemorrhage control, and other life- saving interventions to keep critically wounded patients alive in the golden hour and to the next level of care. The AFMS is the only service transporting patients on long aeromedical evacuation missions from theater to Landstuhl and from Landstuhl to CONUS. Therefore, the Enroute Care thrust area studies include patient timing to transport, cabin altitude, noise, vibration, and environmental issues affecting patient physiology on the aircraft, and the Human Performance thrust area compliments Enroute Care through its studies on medic and aircrew performance on long missions, as well as special operations forces performance. Medical development and biomedical technology investments in FHP seek to deliver an improved force health protection capability across the full spectrum of operations with research that prevents injury/illness through improved identification and control of health risks. Under Force Health Protection, sub-project areas include: Directed Energy, Occupational and Environmental Health, and Advanced Diagnostics/Therapeutics. Operational medicine is focused on in garrison care - our next most critical issue post OIF/OEF - and how to care for the whole patient and consideration of comorbidities in treatment of wounded warriors and dependents. For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Medical Development programs include the Neuroscience CoE, the Prostate Cancer CoE, and the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine. The Neuroscience Center of Excellence (CoE), formerly a Congressional Special Interest program, was chartered in 2002 to conduct basic, clinical and translational research studies of militarily relevant neurological disorders affecting US service members and military medical beneficiaries. The Center's mission is to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders that directly affect warfighters through a multi- site research program that collaborates broadly with military, civilian and federal medical institutions. The Prostate CoE, formerly a Congressional Special Interest program, was chartered in 1992 to conduct basic, clinical and translational research programs to combat diseases of the prostate. The program's mission is fulfilled primarily through its three principal programs- the Clinical Translational Research Center, the Basic Science Research Program and the Tri-Service Multicenter Prostate Cancer Database which encompasses its clinical research work with other participating military medical centers. These affiliated sites contribute data and biospecimens obtained from prostate cancer patients and participate in clinical trials. The Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM) brings together the expertise of clinicians and scientists across disciplines to catalyze innovative approaches to traumatic brain injury (TBI) research. CNRM Research Programs emphasize aspects of high relevance to military populations, with a primary focus on patients at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Military operational medicine efforts focused on: validation of dose response curves for noise induced hearing loss, use of animal models to determine protective capabilities within the inner ear using antioxidants and determine the most effective doses and maximum time delays to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. This information will result in significant reductions in noise-related compensation claims to the Department of Veterans Affairs and facilitate the return-to-duty for injured Warfighters. Additional efforts focused on: performance validation of the surface-mounted clay add-on device using live-fire tests of military-grade armor systems providing the first biomedically valid behind-body-armor design standard as a replacement to the current Department of Justice standard. This will allow equipment developers to design body armor appropriate to the specific needs of each region of the body. Other efforts entailed: (1) conducting human clinical trials of the Hydration Status Monitor (a device to monitor fluid intake and electrolyte imbalance) for diagnostic and biological testing; (2) field studies to determine the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplements on nutritional status of Warfighters leading to improved bone health and mitigating the potential for bone stress fractures; and (3) validation of constructs of Warfighters performance, mental strength and psychological well-being using current psychological assessment tools providing a validated portfolio of self-reporting instruments capable of assessing various psychological attributes of military personnel, thereby enhancing psychological resilience. Combat casualty care research pursued successful studies, from FY11-13, such as the study of enhanced oxygen delivery in acute spinal cord injury, the plasma volume expander, red blood cell storage research and started technology development of platelet-derived agents to stop bleeding and neuromodulation (a treatment that delivers either electricity or drugs to nerves in order to change their activity) for the repair of traumatic injuries to the brain.

Sensory system efforts to be initiated in FY13 were postponed to FY14 due to sequestration. FY 2014 Plans: Medical training and health information sciences research efforts are working in two primary research portfolios: Medical Simulation and Training, and Health Informatics and Information Technology. Medical simulation and training focus is on research opportunities identified by the Combat Casualty Training Consortium (CCTC), which is identifying potential gaps where simulation technology can be utilized to support combat medic training and has the impact of reducing and refining live-tissue training. Additional emphasis is being placed on the technologies to teach and train effective team communication. The concept of an open-source tissue model for developers and end-users to facilitate cohesive content delivery for manikins or virtual models is in progress. The medical practice initiative efforts are aimed at understanding healthcare personnel skill decay through improved team training and its correlation with skill. Health informatics and information technology conducts research on risk reduction within the Military Health System to identify ways to reduce potential near- and long-term cost of information technology and systems, as well as the transition of a joint Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and DoD integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR). Clinical decision support exploration within nursing continues within the portfolio. The military infectious diseases research program is funding one multi-year, clinical study for development of an antibacterial drug against multiple drug resistant bacteria in antimicrobial countermeasures; one host/pathogen biomarker project in wound infection prevention and management for detection of bacterial infection in wounds; and one diagnostic project in wound infection prevention and management for the detection of bacterial infections in wounds. Military operational medicine research will be continuing medical technology development efforts initiated in FY13 in nutrition and dietary supplements, Warfighter performance and sustainment in extreme environments (such as extreme heat, cold, or altitude), establishment of return to duty/medical standards criteria, blast injury models and performance standards for protections systems, diagnostics and metrics for hearing loss and protection, alcohol and substance abuse, diagnosis and treatment of deployment-related psychological health problems, diagnosis and treatment of PTSD, military family and Warfighter resilience, suicide prevention, pulmonary health (pertaining to the lungs) in the deployed environment, and blast exposure during breaching (process used to force open closed and/or locked doors).

FY 2013 Accomplishments: The Gynecologic Cancer Center of Excellence extended previous studies of gynecologic cancer metastasis (spread of cancer from one organ or part to another non-adjacent organ or part) and recurrence, patient survival, drug resistance and racial disparities in cancer outcome by completing clinical assay and validation studies of the most promising biomarker panels. Molecular-based prediction models with the best sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive value were promoted for specific clinical indications and deployment in independent surgical and/or biopsy specimens and biofluids (biological fluids like blood, urine, breast milk, and cerebrospinal fluid). Data forthcoming from molecular studies (DNA, RNA, protein) was integrated utilizing computational biology to elucidate systems-level regulatory mechanisms underlying metastasis and recurrence in endometrial (membrane lining the uterus) cancer along with drug resistance, tumor progression, and survival in primary compared with metastatic and recurrent ovarian cancers. Approximately 600 patients with gynecologic cancer undergoing surgery for primary or recurrent disease as well as additional control patients with benign conditions undergoing a hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) were enrolled on the Tissue and Data Acquisition Network (TDAN) protocol to collect various types of tumor and normal tissues, blood for extraction of DNA, RNA and microRNA, as well as serum and urine. TDAN specimens were linked with detailed clinical, treatment, outcome and life-style questionnaire data.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 CPDR continues to lead its original discovery towards evaluations of a common defect of ERG cancer gene in prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Development of the CPDR-ERG monoclonal antibody has streamlined the world-wide evaluations of the ERG oncoprotein in clinical specimens. New ground-breaking research from CPDR has established unexpected ethnic differences of ERG frequencies between Caucasian Americans and African American patients. These results for the first time have potential to define molecular basis of ethnic differences in prostate cancer which has implications in both the fields of biomarker performance and personalized medicine. A new CPDR initiative has led to the generation of whole-genome and transcriptome data in a matched cohort of African American and Caucasian American patients that is anticipated to enhance the understanding of genomic differences of prostate cancer between these ethnic groups. Cancer biology evaluation of the most common prostate cancer gene ERG in transgenic mouse model has provided new insights into the mechanisms of ERG functions in prostate cancer initiation and progression. Towards developing innovative prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis platforms, collaborations are in progress with leading companies such as, Genomic Health, Iris Molecular Diagnostics, Berg Pharma, Biocare Medical and Exosome. Hormonal mechanisms play central roles in prostate cancer onset of progression. CPDR has developed a new marker panel to read out the defects of hormone pathways in subsets of prostate cancers that may represent highly aggressive disease. CPDR has also made a discovery of a new pathway for androgen receptor degradation which has future potential in treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The National Database program continues to enroll men with prostatic diseases including clinico-pathologic, demographic, and longitudinal follow-up and treatment outcomes data. A new collaborative initiative has been established to evaluate the utility of a prognostic Oncotype DX prostate cancer panel developed by Genomic Heath. The Biospecimen Banking and Database programs continue to enhance multi-disciplinary translational research activities at CPDR and other leading DoD and civilian medical centers. The Integrated CPDR Information Management System has been completed that includes integration of bio-medical data, controlled biospecimen management and tracking systems.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification To better protect mounted warriors from the effects of underbody blast (UBB) caused by landmines or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), the Underbody Blast (UBB) Testing medical research project will provide new data on the biomechanics of human skeletal response that occurs in an attack on a ground combat vehicle. The data will provide a biomedical basis for the development of a Warrior-representative blast test manikin (the Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin or WIAMan project) and the required biomedically-valid injury criteria that can be used in Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation to characterize dynamic events, the risk of injury to mounted warriors, and to support acquisition decisions. This new data will also benefit the overall DOD effort in vehicle and protection technology for the UBB threat. This work is needed to overcome the limitations of the current test manikin and injury criteria which were designed for the civilian automotive industry for frontal crash testing and as such are not adequate in the combat environment. The current manikins do not represent the modern Soldier and were not designed for the vertical acceleration environment associated with UBB events. Consequently, current LFT&E crew survivability assessment methodologies are limited in their ability to predict the types and severity of injuries seen in these events. Due to this technology gap, military ground vehicles are being fielded without fully defined levels of injury risk and crew survivability for UBB events. The data produced by this project will be used to satisfy a critical need for a scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 Title: Underbody Blast Testing Description: Will provide an understanding of the biomechanics of skeletal injuries that occur in a combat vehicle UBB event involving a landmine or IED, and will provide the biomedical basis for the development of a Warrior-representative blast test manikin and associated biomedically-validated injury criteria that can be used to characterize dynamic events and injury risks for live-fire test and evaluation (LFT&E) crew survivability assessments and vehicle development efforts to better protect Warriors from UBB threats. FY 2013 Accomplishments: The Underbody Blast Testing project collected human response data in a blast environment, including whole-body kinematics (measurement of motion), biofidelity data, and injury data for a seated soldier. This included fabricating and proof testing a first- of-its-kind blast experimental facility for medical research and the associated research techniques. The research considered the effects of warrior posture, the effects of wearing personal protective equipment, and the severity of the UBB threat. Matched pair testing clearly demonstrated differences between the current manikin and actual human response. Research results were coordinated with the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System and demonstrated that the observed injuries closely matched those experienced by soldiers in theaters of operation.

Research plan reviews and test readiness reviews were conducted to define and approve subsequent research for whole-bodies and within particular body regions. Initial research was conducted for the head and neck body region to gather biofidelity and injury data. In addition, a first of its kind review was held to present the medical researchers with de-identified medical images of soldier injuries caused by UBB. This data is critical to assuring that the Underbody Blast Testing project is producing data that is relevant to the military environment. FY 2014 Plans: The Underbody Blast Testing project will be focused on generating and providing medical research data needed to support the development of the WIAMan anthropomorphic (resembling a human) test device concept and the first generation prototype. The emphasis will be on non-injurious or biofidelity data but will also include injurious testing. All body regions will be addressed including whole-body testing and also prioritized testing of the following body regions, foot and ankle, leg, pelvis, lumbar spine, thoracic spine, cervical spine, torso, head and neck. Medical research is adding variations in boundary conditions and other initial condition, including the effect of personal protective equipment. Conduct studies to contrast injuries observed in theater with those created in the test program to validate and prioritize research. Emerging medical research data will be disseminated to the RDT&E community to support protection technology development and modeling and simulation initiatives. FY 2015 Plans: The Underbody Blast Testing project will continue medical research in the areas initiated in FY14 but with the emphasis shifting during the year from non-injurious conditions to those which cause injuries. This will enable the development of initial human injury probability curves that account for influences unique to the military and UBB environment. All data will continue to be transitioned into the WIAMan project to enable the fabrication of the first and second generation prototype anthropometric test devices (ATDs). Continue studies to contrast injuries observed in theater with those created in the test program to validate and prioritize research. Emerging medical research data will be disseminated to the RDT&E community to support protection technology development and modeling and simulation initiatives.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB), the Deployed Warfighter Protection project plans to develop new or improved protection for ground forces from disease-carrying insects. The focus of this program is to develop new or improved systems for controlling insects that carry disease under austere, remote, and combat conditions; understand the physiology of insecticidal activity to develop new compounds with greater specific activity and/or higher user acceptability; examine existing area repellents for efficacy and develop new spatially effective repellent systems useful in military situations; develop new methods or formulations for treating cloth to prevent vector biting; and expand the number of active ingredients and formulations of public health pest pesticides, products and application technologies available for safe, and effective applications. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 Title: Deployed Warfighter Protection Description: The Deployed Warfighter Protection Program will develop new or improved protection for ground forces from disease-carrying insects. FY 2013 Accomplishments: The Deployed Warfighter Protection research project expanded and continued implementing plans from FY12 to include new and improved control methods for mosquitoes, sand flies, filth flies and other insects of military importance; assessing innovative spray equipment and conducting pesticide efficacy trials in desert, temperate and tropical environments. This included refocusing control strategies for mosquitoes and sand flies, which are considered the main disease-bearing insect threats to deployed forces; new insect repellent systems and the modification of insecticide application technologies that are more effectively targeting disease carrying insects impacting military readiness. DWFP funded research efforts conducted by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service were featured in the November/December 2012 edition of the USDA ARS Magazine (See: http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/nov12/index.htm). The article provided an overview of the DoD funded research conducted by the USDA ARS highlighting synergistic efforts specifically meeting the needs of the military and notable for having an exceptional return on investment ratio of approximately 3 dollars of research effort for every 1 DWFP dollar invested. Similar successes were achieved in the competitive grant portfolio where DWFP managed 15 grants given to industry, academia and government labs in FY13. So far in FY13 DWFP produced an additional market-ready product and several more expected in the coming months. Specifically, attractive targeted sugar bait (ATSB\u00ae) received a registered trademark, patented use, commercial partner and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved label for the professional product being evaluated for3.924 5.420 4.553 Volume 1 - 127UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603115HP: Medical Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 74 of 76 R-1 Line #6Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2015 Defense Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130 / 2R-1 Medical Technology DevelopmentProject (Number/Name) 830A / Deployed Warfighter Protection (Army) B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 efficacy in mosquito control districts throughout CONUS and against sand flies in Europe. Feedback from these trials will impact the final military use product. Other significant accomplishments included several material transfer agreements with both US and international companies to evaluate and develop products used around the globe for insect protection, but not currently available in the US. These included spatial / area repellents; a critical replacement for permethrin treatment of military uniforms to make them repellent against biting insects; new specialized spray products for treating aircraft and ships; and durable insecticidal lining materials for attaching to interior walls of tents and more permanent structures. Significant advances were also made toward commercial development of an additional pesticide active ingredient for use as a rodent feed-through insecticide for killing desert sand flies that transmit human disease to military personnel. Numerous commercially available and experimental insecticides and sprayers were evaluated with the best performers added to the military stock system for use by combat forces. Two US patents were issued and seven submitted for products with military utility. These comprised the ATSB method; two new spatial repellents; a topical repellent more potent and longer-lasting than the common DEET; insecticide curtains for keeping insects out of aircraft and ships; specialized formulation of a toxicant (poison that is made by humans) used in a DWFP patented mosquito trap; a skin applied product that prevents insects from detecting human odors; an atomizer to produce ultra small droplets needed to kill flying mosquitoes; and a new bed net fabric design. Arising from the cumulative DWFP efforts on sand fly control, AFPMB approved the addition of a DoD technical guide for sand fly biology and control globally. During FY13, more than 70 additional peer reviewed scientific publications resulted from DWFP efforts. New and ongoing efforts are detailed in the FY14 section below. Multiple USDA and Competitive Grant projects were delayed by 3 to 6 months due to reduced funding for FY13. FY 2014 Plans: The Deployed Warfighter Protection project continues FY13 efforts concentrating on developing products and resources to enable combat forces to better protect themselves and control militarily important insects that bite, sting and transmit force degrading diseases. This is accomplished through continuing R&D to discover, develop, patent, license, produce and secure commercially feasible products, and EPA registration of new and improved insecticides, application technologies and repellent systems. The DWFP is: (1) actively pursuing EPA product label changes for use against disease-carrying insects threatening deployments outside the United States; (2) continuing field trials, engaging regional, national and international commercial partners and developing reduced risk pesticides such as ATSBs\u00ae and other insecticides found to be effective for desert sand flies, blood- sucking flies and filth fly control; (3) continuing cooperative work and formal Agreements with industry promoting insecticide development and EPA registrations; (4) evaluating insect control materials and application technologies in collaboration with military labs and others in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Pacific; (5) conducting field trials of patented next generation \"lethal ovitraps\" designed to attract and kill disease carrying mosquitoes when they are trying to lay their eggs; (6) optimizing patented molecular, highly specific insecticides based on genes specific for target insects; (7) continuing field evaluations of experimental and military stock listed equipment and insecticides against CONUS and OCONUS medically important insects; (8) continuing evaluations of new commercial sprayers, with best performing products added to the military stock system; (9) continuing assessments of how insecticide aerosols kill insects in desert, temperate and tropical environments; (10) continuing CONUS Volume 1 - 128UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603115HP: Medical Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 75 of 76 R-1 Line #6Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2015 Defense Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130 / 2R-1 Medical Technology DevelopmentProject (Number/Name) 830A / Deployed Warfighter Protection (Army) B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Army Medical Command received PE 0605013 funding to identify, explore, and demonstrate key information technologies to overcome medical and military unique technology barriers. Programs include Army service level support for the Medical Operational Data System (MODS), the Army Medicine Chief Information Officer's (CIO) Management Operations, the Army Warrior Care and Transition System (AWCTS), the Psychological and Behavioral Health - Tools for Evaluation, Risk, and Management (PBH-TERM), the Workload Management System for Nursing - Internet (WMSNi), the Multidrug-Resistant Organism Repository and Surveillance Network (MRSN), and the Veterinary Services Systems Management (VSSM). The Navy Medical Command RDT&E funding supports the development required for those systems which are integral to Navy Medicine (i.e., Navy Medicine Online (NMO)). Navy Medicine also funds, when appropriate, a number of small-scale, opportunistic business improvements when the technology makes a sudden advance. These projects are generally not in the scope of the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) Central Programs such as the development/integration of Defense Optical Fabrication Enterprise Management System (DOFEMS) into a fully automated system to support workload distribution, performance metrics, staffing requirements, supply management, calculation of operating costs from the current independently or manually DOFEMS system. This effort will be a web based centralized management tool and provide a standalone standard set of Lab Management software for all 26 Navy labs. Additionally, the re-design of HIV Management System (HMS) will be more user friendly, less time to perform everyday tasks and prevents the need to maintain separate databases. The re-design will also automate and minimize functions that require manual assistance and assist in fulfilling new requirements. For the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS), this program element supports IM/IT development requirements within four AFMS Chief Information Officer defined core capabilities as essential to Air Force Medical Service IM/IT mission support. Data warehousing, reporting services, systems integration, and custom application development are featured in almost all IM/IT systems and application requests. The information needs of the AFMS are growing in volume, complexity, and delivery formats. In order to meet future requirements, aggregation of more and varied data sources require increasingly complex data warehousing capabilities. Demand for Volume 1 - 147UNCLASSIFIED PE 0605013HP: Information Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 4 of 74 R-1 Line #8Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2015 Defense Health Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0605013HP / Information Technology Development dynamic analytic capability will require investments in business intelligence, predictive analytic tools, open source research data models, and emerging personalized medicine analysis. Information is still largely produced in an ad hoc manner without standard methodologies, mapping of business requirements, transparent analytic models, and distributed by office productivity software. Centralized production of standard reports, balance sheets, and dynamic query tools would relieve many managers and action officer of routine work and increase leadership decision support. AFMS medical readiness reporting and tracking has set the standard in the DoD for over a decade but multiple applications now encompass what has merged into a common process of tracking unit capability and personal health assessments. Consolidation of medical readiness applications would streamline disability, medical readiness, deployment surveillance, and flying status tracking and reporting who currently must move between multiple applications. For the Air Force, the funding in this program element provides for sustainment of the IM/IT Test Bed (IMIT-TB) capability, which is a dedicated OT location and staff encompassing the entire spectrum of healthcare services and products available in MTFs, to provide risk controlled testing of designated core and interim medical applications in a live environment. The MHS centrally-managed, Tri-Service IM/IT RDT&E program includes funding for development/integration, test and evaluation for the following initiatives of special interest: 1) Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) which is a new Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program designed to replace/sunset the current portfolio of systems providing initial Electronic Health Record (EHR) capability, such as AHLTA (which is DoD\u00b4s current EHR and one of the world's largest clinical information systems that provides worldwide online access to patients medical records) and the Composite Health Care System (CHCS) (which is the military's legacy computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system used for ordering/documenting lab tests, radiology exams, prescription transactions, and for documenting outpatient appointments as well as other care that is administered). iEHR will establish a comprehensive, longitudinal, electronic health record that will also support the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) HEALTH initiative. Commensurate with the OSD AT&L Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), dated July 21, 2013, the former joint DoD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program has been restructured to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program and the joint iEHR program; 2) Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) integrates components of the military medical information systems to ensure interoperable medical support for all Theater and deployed forces; 3) Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) provides integrated supply chain and life cycle management for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, equipment, health facilities, and services; 4) Executive Information/Decision Support (EI/DS) receives, stores, processes data from MHS systems used for managing the business of health care; 5) Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System - Industrial Hygiene (DOEHRS-IH) assembles, evaluates and stores data on occupational personnel exposure information, workplace environment monitoring, personnel protective equipment usage, and observation of work practices. The Central IM/IT Program also provides RDT&E funding for mission essential initiatives such as: funding for other related technical activities such as shared services investment and for various Wounded, Ill and Injured (WII) Warrior initiatives like Health Artifact and Image Management Solution (HAIMS), and Federated Registry Framework. The DHP RDT&E appropriation includes the following TMA initiatives: Electronic Commerce System (E-Commerce): This system was developed for centralized collection, integration, and reporting of accurate purchased care contracting and financial data. It provides an integrated set of data reports from multiple data sources to management, as well as tools to control the end-to-end program change management process. E-Commerce is composed of several major applications including: Contract Management (CM), utilizing Prism software to support contract action development and documentation; Resource Management (RM), employing Oracle Federal Financials and TED interface software to support the budgeting, accounting, case recoupment, and disbursement processes; Document Management, utilizing Document software to provide electronic storage, management, and retrieval of contract files; Management Tracking and Reporting, utilizing custom software to Volume 1 - 148UNCLASSIFIED PE 0605013HP: Information Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 5 of 74 R-1 Line #8Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2015 Defense Health Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0605013HP / Information Technology Development provide reports to assist in the management and tracking of changes to the managed care contracts as well as current and out year liabilities; the Purchased Care and Contractor's Resource Center web sites that provide up-to-date financial information for both TMA and the Services concerning the military treatment facilities (MTFs), and expenditures for MTF enrollee purchased care and supplemental care. E-Commerce includes an infrastructure of over 60 servers supporting development, test, and production. E-Commerce is employed by several hundred users in more than 7 different organizations. Project oversight and coordination must be provided to ensure that the needs of the disparate organizations are met without influencing system performance or support to any individual user. Server configurations must remain current with respect to security policies, user authorizations, and interactions with other systems and functions. All of these activities must be managed and coordinated on a daily basis. Disability Mediation Service (DMS): The VTA (Veteran's Tracking Application) has been the primary system to track, record, and report data for the IDES (Integrated Disability Evaluation System) process. The VTA is scheduled to sun-set, by VA (Veterans Affairs), and the data is being moved to another application. Migration of VTA to another application creates the requirement to allow data exchange between Service non-medical case management and new VA DES (Disability Evaluation System) IT application. The BEC (Benefits Executive Council) is looking to create a DMS (Disability Mediation Service), which is an integrator between the Services and VA. The DMS will facilitate the improvement of non-medical case management tracking and IDES data/information management. It will eliminate redundant data entry within DoD (Department of Defense), improving data quality by capturing more data for operational reporting from the Services and WCP, decrease backlog by eliminating data entry duplication, and minimize impact to DoD Services by allowing the Services to continue using their existing/planned systems without requiring retraining on a new applications. The DMS will be created from existing technology. It will provide a mediation service to help isolate each system from changes and uniqueness in the other systems and allow the Services and WCP to report and drill down on data that we capture during the exchange. This IT solution will not replace current DoD systems, but will require some modifications and enhancements to those systems to support the date exchange. WCP will support development costs for these efforts. Services will assume responsibility and POM costs for modifications, enhancements, and maintenance in the out years.\" B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The primary goal of the VLER Health initiative is to enable the secure sharing of health information (i.e., demographic and clinical data) between DoD and external Federal and private sector partners which meets Meaningful Use (MU) requirements to improve healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency. By electronically sharing health information using national standards, that information can support tracking key clinical conditions, communicating that information to better coordinate care, and engaging patients in their own care. The VLER Health initiative provides clinicians with the most up-to-date information, potentially reducing redundant diagnostic tests, medical errors, paperwork and handling, and overall healthcare costs. These benefits, in turn, align with the MHS quadruple aim by ensuring that the military force is medically ready to deploy; the military beneficiary population remains healthy through focused prevention; patient care is convenient, equitable, safe, and of the highest quality; and the total cost of healthcare is reduced through the reduction of waste and focus on quality. VLER Health funding will be reflected in the Integrated Electronic Health Record Program Element 0605023 in FY 2014 and out. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 Title: Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) HEALTH (Tri-Service) Description: Work with Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), and Private Sector to expand VLER. FY 2013 Accomplishments: VLER Exchange (the DoD system responsible for exchanging health information with both Federal and private healthcare partners) deployed a new release that included technical enhancements (e.g., an upgrade in the CONNECT software from version 2.4.7 to 3.3) to improve its speed and reliability. VLER Exchange deployed new functionality at select pilot sites to enable non-active duty medical beneficiaries to opt out from sharing their health information with external partners; to enable DoD to display, approve, and reject SSA authorization forms; and provide the ability to accept and send additional patient health data to and from external partners via structured and unstructured documents in a safe and secure manner, in accordance with DoD privacy and security requirements. An opt-in/opt-out policy for non-active duty medical beneficiaries was drafted and will be evaluated and finalized after the new VLER Exchange functionality and technical upgrades deployed at pilot sites are evaluated. The purpose of the pilot is to validate business rules, inform policy, and assess improvements in the system's speed and reliability.7.458 - - Volume 1 - 175UNCLASSIFIED PE 0605013HP: Information Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 32 of 74 R-1 Line #8Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2015 Defense Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130 / 2R-1 Information DevelopmentProject (Number/Name) 386A / Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) HEALTH (Tri-Service) B.

DCoE also seeks to mitigate the stigma that still deters some from reaching out for help for problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder and TBI. The organization has a leadership role in collaborating with a national network of external entities[1] including non-profit organizations,[2] other DoD agencies, academia, Congress,[3] military services and other federal agencies.[4] Public health service and civil service workers, including personnel from the Department of Veterans Affairs and individuals from all the military services as well as contract personnel comprise the staff of DCoE. DCoE's goals include providing the necessary resources to facilitate the care of service members who experience TBI or PH concerns and ensuring that appropriate standards of care exist and are maintained across the Department of Defense. DCoE seeks to create, identify and share best practices, conducting necessary pilot or demonstration projects to better inform quality standards when best practices or evidence based recommendations are not readily available. Other DCoE goals include ensuring that program standards are executed and quality is consistent and creating a system in which individuals across the United States expect and receive the same level and quality of service regardless of their service branch, component, rank or geographic location. DCoE comprises eight directorates and six component centers responsible for TBI/PH issues. These DCoE entities execute programs, provide clinical care, conduct research, identify and share best practices and provide strategic planning for PH and TBI across the DoD. B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The NICoE Continuity Management Tool (NCMT) is a business intelligence tool to perform healthcare modeling and analysis of NICoE activities. Major capabilities defined by the NICoE in Jun 2009 and refined in Jun 2010 prior to the program procurement in Sep 2010, are subsystems that make up the NCMT end-to-end system, and were prioritized in the following order: Continuity Management Subsystem, Scheduling Subsystem, Clinical Subsystem, Research Subsystem, Training and Education Subsystem, Administration Subsystem. Continuity Management Subsystem: Records every interaction with a particular Warrior and his or her Family as one entity to manage initial contact, referral, screening, intake, pre-admission, admission, discharge and follow-up processes. Scheduling Subsystem: Captures, organizes, displays the complex schedules of the NICoE. Used to manage patient appointments, the utilization of facility resources including treatment rooms, modalities, provider staff and support staff. Clinical Subsystem: A clinical application and clinical database that includes the functions that allow the user to store, classify, analyze, retrieve, interpret, present clinical data. Allows the visualization of all of the various components of the patient's health record: radiology, pathology, lab results, neurological assessments, etc. Research Subsystem: Consists of the research database and the applications that allow the user to store, classify, analyze, retrieve, interpret, present data. Allows NICoE to aggregate data from disparate systems, both within the NICoE and from partner organizations, helping the research move faster, with more agility, and with purpose and direction supported by validated facts. Allows researchers to address many data challenges from a single system and transforms the way they do research. Training and Education Subsystem: Provides the ability to share relevant research, diagnosis, treatment information with authorized users. Administration Subsystem: Provides the ability to manage a portfolio of projects related to continuity of care, clinical operations, research, training and education functions in the NICoE. The NCMT is supported by Three Contracts: Hosting (Provides Hardware, Software, Maintenance), System Integration (Implements NICoE Functional Requirements, Turns NICoE Ideas and Goals into Computer Screens, Templates, Applications - Capabilities) and Decision Support (Acquisition Management, Requirements Definition, Implementation Planning).

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Health Artifact and Image Management Solution (HAIMS) enables the DoD and the VA healthcare providers to have global access and awareness of artifacts and images (A&I) generated during the healthcare delivery process. HAIMS will provide the new capability for users throughout the MHS to be aware and have access to A&I that have been registered with the central \"system\", currently on local workstations and Military Treatment Facility (MTF) Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACs). As patients move through the continuum of care from Continental United States to Theater and then return to DoD sustaining bases facilities, healthcare A&I moves seamlessly and simultaneously with the patient. This advances several MHS strategy initiatives such as achievement of paperless record, global access of Wounded Warrior scanned documents, and an alternative to finding storage space for paper records of merging MTFs. HAIMS will supply access to VHA and other external A&I both inside and outside the Military Health System (MHS) Electronic Health Record (EHR). Funding has been provided within this program element in prior years for HAIMS before if was identified as its own system in the budget cycle.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification In March 2008, the MHS embarked upon Electronic Health Record (EHR) modernization planning, establishing the initial Electronic Health Records Way Ahead (EHRWA). In March 2011, the Program was expanded to include the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a joint initiative to implement a new, integrated electronic health record for both Departments, called the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program. Secretary Hagel's Memorandum titled \"Integrated Electronic Health Records,\" dated May 2013, provided additional direction to the program: DoD shall continue near-term coordinated efforts with VA to develop data federation, presentation, and interoperability. This near-term goal shall be pursued as a first priority separately from the longer-term goal of health record information technology (IT) modernization. DoD shall pursue a full and open competition for a core set of capabilities for EHR modernization. To fulfill Secretary Hagel's directive, parallel programs have been defined, splitting the original iEHR program into two distinct areas. In the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), dated June 21, 2013 and an ADM providing direction and guidance for PEO DHMS issued on January 2, 2014, the former joint DoD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program has been restructured to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program Volume 1 - 219UNCLASSIFIED PE 0605023HP: Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 2 of 10 R-1 Line #9Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2015 Defense Health Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0605023HP / Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) and a newly defined iEHR program focused on providing seamless integrated sharing of electronic health data between the DoD and VA (renamed Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX)). iEHR RDT&E is reported under the program element (PE) 0605013 through FY 2013 inclusive, but iEHR, VLER Health and DHMSM will be reported under new program element 0605023 for FY 2014.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Commensurate with the OSD AT&L Acquisition Decision Memoranda (ADM), dated July 21, 2013 and January 2, 2014, the former joint DoD and VA iEHR program has been restructured within the DoD to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program and a redefined iEHR program. These programs report through the PEO DoD Healthcare Management Systems (DHMS) to the USD (AT&L). The redefined iEHR program will be called the Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX) and will encompass health data sharing and interoperability across the lifecycle to include data sharing/interoperability with the VA, private healthcare providers and patients. The iEHR Increment 1 initiative will complete delivery of its defined requirements in FY2014 and transition into sustainment beginning in FY2015 under the Defense Health Agency Health Information Technology organization. Due to timelines for budget preparation and submission, a separate initiative could not be generated the funding needed for DMIX in FY2015 is reflected this initiative. A new initiative for the DMIX initiative will be formally established with the FY2016 budget. The DMIX program will acquire the capabilities necessary to securely and reliably exchange standardized, normalized, and correlated health data with all partners through standard data / information exchange mechanisms. This will allow users in different places and different organizations to access, use, and supplement health data (technical interoperability) that has a shared meaning so users (assisted by computers) are able to make care decisions (Semantic Interoperability - Level 4). DMIX will consist of Data Federation (DF), Access Management, Service Oriented Architecture / Enterprise Service Bus (SOA/ESB) capabilities, and leverage Identity Management capabilities provided by DMDC. In addition, VLER Health, to include Exchange and Direct, will continue to be part of the DMIX program. Use of the health data may be done via legacy systems, clinical mobile applications and system agnostic viewers such as the Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV). iEHR RDT&E is reported under the program element 0605013 through FY 2013 inclusive, but will be reported under new program element 0605023 for FY 2014 and out. Plans for out year RDT&E are not finalized at this time. B.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 Description: The Department will benefit from the iEHR Increment 1 user-facing capabilities. Single Sign-On will streamline the login process allowing the user to sign in once and leverage securely stored credentials to automatically access the other available applications. Context Management will automatically present the same patient's data within all applications in use by the practitioner. iEHR Increment 1 will also enhance infrastructure services such as virtualization; establish a Development Test Center/Environment configuration; and provides critical upgrades to the Clinical Data Repository. The Department will benefit from the work of the newly defined DMIX Program, which will enable interoperability between legacy and new health IT systems, information and people from all critical Defense Health Association (DHA) and VA health data domains. Building from the Data Federation Accelerators, the DMIX will provide secure and reliable exchange of standardized and computable health data with all partners, including other Departments, private sector health care providers, and health information exchange organizations. DMIX will enable the decommissioning of legacy VA-DoD FY 2013 Accomplishments: No funding programmed in this program element. FY 2014 Plans: iEHR Increment 1 Milestone B baseline requirements to include the Essential Business Functions (EBF) of Context Management, a Single Sign-On capability, and Application Virtualization Hosting Environment (AVHE) to support roaming capability in one location will be completed by May 2014. A limited fielding decision will be conducted by May 2014 based on the completion of the Increment 1 Milestone B EBFs. An operational assessment, under the cognizance of DOT&E, will be conducted in support of a planned Full Deployment Decision prior to end of the Fiscal Year. Following successful operational assessment, iEHR Increment 1 will transition to DHA for operations and sustainment. DMIX will complete the 2014 NDAA requirements for health care data to be computable in real time and comply with existing national data standards. In addition, we will provide infrastructure improvements to enhance reliability, scalability, and efficiency of the capability that leverages the MED-COI, which segregates the capability off of the NIPRNet and leverages enterprise patient identity management service.

Acquisition Strategy Evaluate and use the most appropriate business, technical, contract and support strategies and acquisition approach to minimize costs, reduce program risks, and remain within schedule while meeting program objectives. Strategy is revised as required as a result of periodic program reviews or major decisions. iEHR/DMIX is a collaborative effort between the DoD and VA to share Health Care Resources to improve access to, and quality and cost effectiveness of, health care as mandated by law. This investment is deeply embedded in the MHS Enterprise Roadmap as both Departments have need for modernization/ replacement of existing legacy systems. This investment will use a combination of an open architecture approach, and the purchase (in some instances) of GOTS and COTS products. E.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The primary goal of the VLER Health initiative is to enable the secure sharing of health information (i.e., demographic and clinical data) between DoD and external Federal and private sector partners which meets Meaningful Use (MU) requirements to improve healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency. By electronically sharing health information using national standards, that information can support tracking key clinical conditions, communicating that information to better coordinate care, and engaging patients in their own care. The VLER Health initiative provides clinicians with the most up-to-date information, potentially reducing redundant diagnostic tests, medical errors, paperwork and handling, and overall healthcare costs. These benefits, in turn, align with the MHS quadruple aim by ensuring that the military force is medically ready to deploy; the military beneficiary population remains healthy through focused prevention; patient care is convenient, equitable, safe, and of the highest quality; and the total cost of healthcare is reduced through the reduction of waste and focus on quality B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Commensurate with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)) Acquisition Decision Memoranda (ADM), dated July 21, 2013 and January 2, 2014, the former joint DoD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program has been restructured to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program and a newly defined iEHR program focused on providing seamless integrated sharing of electronic health data between the DoD and VA (renamed Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX)). DHMSM will acquire and support deployment, implementation, and sustainment of an electronic health record (EHR) system that replaces the DoD legacy Military Health System (MHS) inpatient and outpatient EHR systems. Overarching goal of the program is to enable healthcare teams to deliver high-quality, safe care and preventive services to patients through the use of easily accessible standards-based computerized patient records resulting in: improved accuracy of diagnoses and impact on health outcomes; increased patient participation in the healthcare process; improved patient-centered care coordination; and increased practice efficiencies in all settings, including operational environments. DHMSM will be executed in two planning Segments. DHMSM Segment 1 will focus on replacement of inpatient and outpatient systems, and will encompass deployment of the enterprise EHR to fixed facilities (garrison and non-garrison), as well as Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and clinics. DHMSM Segment 2 will focus on replacement of the in-theater EHR, and will encompass deployment of the enterprise EHR to en route, ship-board, and expeditionary components. The DHMSM program receives oversight and direction from Program Executive Office (PEO) Defense Healthcare Management System (DHMS) and reports to USD (AT&L). Stakeholders include the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), Defense Health Agency (DHA), USD (AT&L), and PEO DHMS.
