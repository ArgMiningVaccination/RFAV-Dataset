This policy has been developed for the purpose of preventing or reducing the incidence of indoor environmental quality problems. The policy provides an organized approach to addressing indoor environmental quality issues from several different directions. It is generally recognized that failing to respond to an indoor environmental quality concern in a timely and appropriate manner can have numerous detrimental consequences such as: - Increasing long and short term health problems such as cough, eye irritation, headache, asthma attacks and allergic reactions and in rare instances, leading to life threatening conditions such as severe asthma attacks, Legionnaire's disease or carbon monoxide poisoning - Promoting the spread of airborne infectious diseases - Producing an unfavorable work and learning environment - Reducing the productivity of faculty, staff and students due to discomfort, sickness, or absenteeism - Accelerating the deterioration and thus reducing the efficiency of the physical plant and equipment - Increasing the risk that areas of buildings will have to be closed and the occupants temporarily relocated - Straining relationships among the administration, faculty, staff and students - Generating negative publicity that could damage the University's image and effectiveness - Creating potential liability problems. The large number of faculty, staff and students as well as the number and variety of buildings making up the University community combine to present many unique indoor environmental quality challenges. The types of heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems may vary from building to building making the development of routine and standardized maintenance procedures difficult. The scheduled HVAC upkeep, ranging from daily cleaning to equipment service, must be carried out by Facilities Services staff that may not have the financial resources to provide anything above the most basic services required to keep a building running. The specific objectives of this IEQ policy and of the program resulting from its implementation are: - To reduce employee complaints, health related symptoms, and illness that may be due to indoor environmental problems; - To reduce the frequency and number of employee lost-time incidents that can be attributed to indoor environmental problems; - To improve the quality of the indoor work environment; - To establish a pro-active policy and guidance in addressing issues that relate to indoor environments and will maintain good indoor environmental quality in the future; - Provide guidance on whom to contact when a concern about the indoor environment is raised, and on the ways to proceed in evaluating concerns. The following sections of this policy present general information regarding indoor environmental quality concerns as well as specific information relevant to the IEQ program at the University of Florida. This policy is meant to be a working document that will be reviewed and updated periodically as new information or policies become available. * The term Facilities Services is used throughout this document to represent the designated maintenance group regardless of the University division. POLICY In recognition of the important role that good indoor environmental quality has in contributing to the health and comfort of University faculty, staff and students, this policy serves as both a source of general indoor environmental quality information and a statement of the items necessary to maintain a satisfactory work environment. Members of the University community are expected to follow the requirements and recommendations contained in the policy and to recognize that indoor environmental quality issues may have multiple contributory causes and may, on occasion, not have a simple solution. AUTHORITY By authority delegated from the University President, the Vice-President for Business Affairs is responsible for the safety of all University facilities. Under this authority, policies are developed to provide a safe teaching, research, service, housing and recreational environment. RESPONSIBILITIES PROCEDURES Several factors are recognized as being important towards contributing to an acceptable indoor environment. In general, an indoor environment is expected to be free of any noxious odors and dust and to be maintained at a comfortable temperature and humidity. More specific factors that must be present to assure an acceptable indoor environment include adherence to applicable ventilation guidelines and standards designed to maintain comfort factors acceptable to most occupants. All mechanical equipment, including air handling units and exhaust fans, must be maintained in working order and in a clean, uncontaminated state. Any significant sources of contaminant emissions must be kept isolated from occupied spaces and any major sources of contamination must be promptly controlled. Maintenance and construction activities must be conducted in a manner that does not adversely affect the indoor environmental quality in occupied areas. Common terms used to describe the conditions in a building when an IEQ concern is suspected are defined below.
