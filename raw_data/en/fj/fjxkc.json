We put buzzy treatments from halotherapy to facial yoga to the test so you don't have to\u2014all in the name of living your best life. Up first? Aura-chakra cleansing. Recently, my life has been marked by change. I moved, got a new job (hello, Oprah!), and experienced a lot of family drama surrounding my father's health. I usually bottle up my emotions and keep it moving, but last November, my best friend and her mom suggested I try an aura cleanse to help me deal with my stress. After, I felt so much lighter, [freed from the negative energy](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/relationships-love/a23456292/positive-affirmations-experiment/) that consumed me. During that session, I learned that I have a bright yellow aura and that my grandmother is my guardian angel. So when my editor recently asked for a volunteer to try an aura and chakra cleansing, I jumped at the chance. Curious to see how the state of my aura has changed over the last year during which my stress and family drama has continued \u2014and where my um, chakras fit into all of this\u2014I visited Mariola Jedynasty, the founder of [Awakening NY Healing Center](https://www.awakeningny.com/). I was prepared to spend hours in a spa-like \"sanctuary\" where the staff helps you manifest a balance of the \"mind, body, and spirit.\" I know, I know. First, I should explain what an aura and chakra cleansing even is. Essentially, it's a practice that involves using Shamanic breath work to remove stagnant energies and emotional blockages. To put that in layman's terms, it's supposed to help you push past what's holding you back via your chakras. According to [The Chopra Center](https://chopra.com/), in ancient India it was believed that chakras are \"swirling wheels of energy that correspond to massive nerve centers in the body. Each chakra contains bundles of nerves and major organs as well as our psychological, emotional, and spiritual states of being.\" In a cleansing like this one, crystals are placed on your seven chakras: the crown, third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, sacral, and root. Together, this helps align the spine from the base to the crown of the head to help energy to flow properly. To do this, the chakras must remain open and aligned, which is how I know my chakras must have been totally out of whack before this. At the shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, crystals lined the walls and the smell of lavender filled the air. A receptionist asked me to complete basic paperwork to outline medical issues, allergies, and whether I'd been cleansed before. Soon after, Jedynasty greeted me and brought me downstairs to the cleansing room. She asked me to take my shoes and socks off before stepping inside, then pulled out an opaque white selenite crystal big enough for me to rest my feet on after sitting. According to Heather Askinosie and Timmi Jandro's [Crystal Muse](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1401952380), selenite crystals double as good omens for cleansing, healing, and protection\u2014exactly what I was in search of. Jedynasty explained that to begin, I'd have to remove all my clothes except my underwear so she could spread a scrub all over my body. I definitely wasn't prepared to be nearly naked in front of a stranger, but I calmed myself down by thinking, If I was getting a massage, it would be the same thing. She warned me that she'd be applying pressure to certain points of my body\u2014 the ones connected to my chakras\u2014throughout the process. \"I am here to cleanse the energy in the body so people can feel more like themselves. As an empath, I can read the information from the electromagnetic field around the body,\" she told me. Later, I learned that Jedynasty became a healer after a successful 15-year career in New York City real estate. She was diagnosed with melanoma 12 years ago and decided it was time to change her life around. \"I was always looking for a deeper understanding of who I was and wanted to feel a stronger connection with the divine. I asked my body how I could help and how to be in tune with my being,\" she told me, explaining how opening Awakening NY helped her transform. \"I started meditating, doing yoga, and eating healthy. I even moved to Westchester to be surrounded by nature. I was craving more mindful, conscious living.\" Back in the healing room and stripped down beneath a set of brown sheets, I took the time to notice my surroundings. To one side, there were several paintings on the wall. One featured a big, colorful prism, and two others had a dream catcher and a wooden bowl. On the other side, I saw a shower in the corner with a sink, mirror, shelves lined with crystals and essential oils, and variously sized Tibetan bowls. When it was time to begin, Jedynasty reminded me to \"let go\" and close my eyes. She asked me to take three deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. I smelled burning sage and heard the sound of palm leaves brushing against my body. She told me this was brushing away the negative energy in me. \"I, Celia, am good enough,\" she told me to repeat three times. Eyes closed, I said it out loud as she continued brushing. My thoughts changed, and I focused on the drama in my life, focusing on really letting it go and opening myself up to more positive energy. Moments later, she exposed my feet, rubbing them with body scrub. And then she started to chant. The only words I could decipher were \"Mother Earth,\" but nothing else. She proceeded to do the same to my legs, arms, and abdomen. As she scrubbed different body parts, I realized she specifically focused on my chest, the center of my stomach, and my lower abdomen. She was putting pressure on the places where my chakras lie\u2014aligning them, and cleansing them of the bad. Eventually, Jedynasty suggested we breathe rhythmically. For every inhale, I'd exhale while making sounds like ha, oh, eh, om. It was awkward; breathing in and out so hard and making noise does not feel natural. But I thought of what she told me at the beginning: \"Just let go and enjoy the experience.\" So I followed her lead. She told me that with each breath, I was ridding myself of sadness and anger. After the breathing work\u2014and in the middle of attempting to relax and empty my mind as instructed\u2014I heard her loudly bang against what I later learned were crystal and Tibetan singing bowls, which are used to heal and meditate. She explained that the sounds created by the bowls are supposed to help bring back the body to a normal frequency and harmony. Crystals are capable of \"receiving, projecting, emanating, refracting, and reflecting\" light. Each vibration ran through my body as she walked around \"playing\" the bowls in different areas across the room. I know it sounds strange, but I swear, I felt little currents each time she made a noise. I thought about how multiple people throughout my life have told me how sensitive I am to energy, and how I have the power of \"reading\" someone when I first meet them. The bowl-clanking happened for what felt like a long time; suddenly, I fell into a light sleep. Instructed to open my eyes when I was ready, I noticed Jedynasty had placed something all around my body: crystals. To learn why, I later spoke with Mark Phillips and Martin Anguiano, the founders of [Spellbound Sky](http://spellboundsky.com/), a celebrity-loved shop for crystals and all things metaphysical. \"Crystals are powerful energy transmitters that exude a pure and uninterrupted frequency that can elevate and inspire your own personal vibration,\" they told me, explaining that each crystal is capable of \"receiving, projecting, emanating, refracting, and reflecting\" light. The stones, therefore, can be used to focus on your intention and attract what you want in life. This explanation makes sense, since I felt vibrations throughout my body as Jedynasty \"played\" the bowls like instruments. While I originally assumed my senses were overreacting, it was powerful to know there was more to it. Phillips and Anguiano also explained that working with different crystals that \"embody the energy\" of each chakra can help restore balance\u2014saying that by doing so, you can become \"an unstoppable force of magic and abundance.\" How promising! As my session with Jedynasty came to a close, she told me she was proud of our work. She said I'd released a ton of negative energy and made room for the positive. From her, I learned that I have a very bright spirit and need to focus it more on myself. She told me that I spend too much time focusing on the needs of others, and need to put myself first\u2014not let other people bring me down. In this moment, I started to cry, because I knew exactly what she was referring to. Recently, I got a call notifying me that my dad was in the hospital for the fifth or sixth time this year. For the first time, I felt numb to the news. I was so used to him experiencing alcohol withdrawal and going about this process that my reaction wasn't immediate. Whenever my dad was sick in the past, I'd panic and drop what I was doing to be by his side. Jedynasty and my aura-chakra cleansing helped me realized that I need to stop trying to save my dad\u2014because I won't be able to. My father is an alcoholic, and that's the way he's chosen to live his life. It's not my responsibility, or my problem, to drop everything I'm doing because of the choices of my father. After that session, I made it a goal to make more time for myself and focus on taking care of my \"bright spirit.\" Wiping my tears away, Jedynasty put a towel beneath my neck and suggested I hop in the shower to wash off the body scrub. Under the water, I felt so much lighter\u2014ready to welcome all the positive vibes into my life. Back upstairs, she handed over an envelope with \"homework.\" It contained a kit with essential crystals, sage, and palo santo, which means \"holy wood\" in Spanish and is cut from a tree native to South America. I opened the envelope at home and realized she shared a list of videos to watch if I was interested in staying in this positive state. To really keep your system cleansed of the negative, Jedynasty recommends booking several of these sessions throughout the year. But they aren't cheap: Just one session will set you back around $250. If that price tag is too hefty, Jedynasty suggests meditation as a more regular alternative, as the practice is believed to help keep your chakras aligned and lead you toward self-awareness. I've started thinking about how I can incorporate meditating into my daily routine, and I'm planning to sage my apartment one weekend soon. While I won't be shelling out $250 every few months for more sanctuary-visits, I'm happy to report that this particular wellness trend was worth it. The aura and chakra cleanse was exactly what I needed to begin my journey toward taking better care of one important person: me.
