Look at that packaging, and you'll not only find an expensive price tag but also many of the same ingredients stored in your kitchen cupboard. Skin represents your protective barrier and the body's largest organ and so you want to treat it with care. However, many [beauty products sold in stores contain carcinogens](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/2004/06/15/exposures-add-up-survey-results/#.WoH4hIZG3TE) and synthetic chemicals. Switching to natural remedies provides a healthier alternative that will keep skin healthy without paying the price of high-end cosmetics. Create your own natural spa experience with these homemade skin healing treatments. Keep Skin Glowing with Green Tea Why green tea? Anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, lowers risk of skin cancer, heals breakouts After learning about the incredible benefits of green tea, you'll never throw out a tea bag again. The next time you brew a cup, save the leaves or bag to use for a facial treatment. [Green tea has impressive healing properties](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddg.12737) that cure acne, reverse signs of aging, reduce the damaging effects of the sun, and lower the risk of skin cancer. After brewing tea, you can place a warm tea bag or leaves over a spot to shrink pores and heal breakouts. You can also store used green tea bags in the fridge. After washing the face, place chilled green tea bags under the eyes to reduce puffiness. Just A Spoonful of Sugar Why sugar? Moisturizes, exfoliates, prevents aging Healthy diets say to steer clear of sweeteners, but adding a bit of sugar to your beauty routine will leave skin looking young and vibrant. [As a natural humectant](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sugar-skincare_n_2133060), sugar naturally absorbs moisture from the environment and hydrates the skin. Sugar also contains glycolic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that promotes cell turnover, generating fresh, younger-looking skin. Sugar particles also provide a natural exfoliant that removes dead cells from the skin's surface to reveal the healthy, radiant skin underneath. Brighten with a Bit of Honey Why honey? Heals scars, evens skin tone, reduces redness, brightens skin Honey, especially raw and unpasteurized, has amazing skin healing properties. [Bees produce honey through a unique process](https://www.healthline.com/health/honey-for-face#how-to-use) that combines enzyme activity, plant matter, and live bacteria. The result: a natural skin remedy that clears acne, heals scars, and evens skin tone. Honey also contains bacteria that activate the immune system, soothes inflammation and redness, and brightens skin. Hydrate Skin with (a little) Olive Oil Why olive oil? Fights skin cancer, heals sunburn, treats acne, softens You might hear the word oil and immediately think \"skin-clogging.\" Olive oil will leave your skin barrier extra smooth and soft. In fact, [a study demonstrated](https://academic.oup.com/carcin/article/21/11/2085/2908770) that when applied to the skin, olive oil protects the skin against ultraviolet rays and fights off cancer-causing cells. You can apply olive oil as a moisturizer, especially after sun exposure or sunburn (wipe off excess to prevent clogging of pores). Olive oil is also rich in vitamins A, D, K, and E that protect against free radicals and treat skin disorders such as acne, psoriasis and seborrheic eczemas. DIY Homemade, Natural Exfoliating Scrub You can benefit from all of these ingredients by mixing them together in a DIY face mask. Create your own homemade skin healing treatment in two minutes with all these amazing natural ingredients. Ingredients: - 1 tablespoon of dried green tea leaves (or 2-4 green tea bags) - 1 cup organic sugar (white or brown) - \u00bd cup extra virgin olive oil - 1 tablespoon of honey Combine all ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place (like a cupboard or medicine cabinet). Apply a spoonful of the mix to the skin and gently massage the face or body for 30 seconds before rinsing. Repeat once or twice a week (no more) to keep skin exfoliated naturally. "}
