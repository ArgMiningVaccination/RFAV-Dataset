Purpose. To provide guidance to health care providers on dis cussing the annual influenza vaccination with per sons aged 65 years and older. a. Annual influenza vaccination for adults 65 years and over is especially important because they are at high risk for complications from influenza. People 65 years and ol der may receive any injectable vaccine ap proved for this age group. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevent ion (CDC) and the Advisory Committee on Imm unization Practices (ACIP) hav e not expressed a preference for any f lu vaccine indicated for people 65 years and older. b. The Department of Defense (DoD ) is dedicated to providing in fluenza immunization to beneficiaries a nd endorses the importance of an nual influenza vaccination as a primary intervention to protect our population. c. Multiple vaccines are appr oved for people 65 years and older (1) Inactivated Influenza Vaccine, quadrivalent (IIV4) a. Flulaval by GlaxoSmithKline)) c. Fluzone Quadrival ent (Sanofi Pasteur) I. Northern Hemisphere formulation II. Hemisphere formulation Flucelvax Quadrivalent (Seqirus) DHA-IHD (877) GETVACC www.health.mil/vaccines 1 DHA-IHD Information Paper Subject: Influenza Vaccines for Adults 65 Years and Older d. There are two vaccines desi gned specifically for people 65 y ears and older, Fluzone High Dose ( IIV3) and Sanofi Pasteur) a. Received licensure from the Food and Drug Administration in 2009. b. Contains four times more ant igen (the part of the vaccine that prompts the body to ma ke antibody) than regular influenza vaccines. 1. A higher dose of antigen in the vaccine is thought to give older people a bette r immune response, and therefore, better protection against flu. c. Data from clinical trials indicate higher antibody levels ar e produced, but whether or not the t hese higher levels lead to greater protection is the topic of ongoing research. d. Based on CDC/ACIP recomm endations, Fluzone High Dose is an acceptable alternative to other vaccines licensed for people 65 years and older. Ther e is no preferential recommendation made for any flu vaccine formulation for this age group. (2) Fluad (aIIV3, Seqirus) a. Received licensure from the Food and Drug Administration in 2015. b. Standard-dose, three-component (trivalent) inactivated flu vaccine that contains an adjuvant, MF59. 1. An adjuvant is an ingredien t added to a vaccine that helps create a stronger immune response to vaccination. 2. MF59 is an oil-in-water e mulsion of squalene oil. Squalene, a naturally occurring substance found in humans, animals and plants, is highly purified for the vaccine manufacturing process. c. Studies have found that antibody levels were comparable to levels induced by unadjuvant ed trivalent seasonal flu vaccines (e.g., Agriflu). DHA-IHD (877) GETVACC www.health.mil/vaccines 2 DHA-IHD Information Paper Subject: Influenza Vaccines for Adults 65 Years and Older d. Based on CDC and ACIP rec ommendations, FLUAD is an acceptable alternative to other vaccines licensed for people 65 years and older. There is no preferential recommendation made for any flu vaccine formu lation for this age group. (3) The high dose and adjuvanted flu vaccines may result in more si de effects than those that can occur with standard- dose seasonal shots. Mild side effects can in clude pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, headache, muscle ache and malaise. 2. Preventive Medicine represent atives of each Service decide annually which influenza vaccines will be include d in bulk vaccine procurement under the DoD Annual Influenza Program; the annual selection is based on CDC/ ACIP recommendations. a. For the 2019-2020 season, FluLaval (IIV4, months), Fluari x (IIV4, 6 mos), and Afluria (IIV4, 6 months) were selected for bulk cont ract procurement. b. The bulk procurement of infl uenza vaccine is selected to mee t the needs of Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in protecting military a nd beneficiary populations with approved and recommended influenza vaccine. c. DoD MTFs can order vaccines not included in bul k procurement through the Defense Logistics Agency Tr oop Support Medical Direct Vendo r Delivery program, via Military Standard Requisitioning and Issu e Procedures (DHA-IPM 16-002). d. cove r all CDC/ACIP recommended inf luenza vaccines at participating network pharmacies. (1) Only vaccines given by a pharmaci st are covered by the pharmacy benefit for free; if a vaccine is a dministered by a provider at an onsite clinic, the beneficiary may have to pay the entire cost. 3. Key Points. a. Annual influenza vaccination is important f or people aged 65 years and older. b. There is no CDC/ACIP preferential recommendation made for an y flu vaccine formulation for people aged 65 years and older. c. The CDC/ACIP will continue to r eview available evidence rega rding possible increased protection by v accines designed specifically for this population (Fluzone HD (IIV3) and Fluad (aIIV3)); evidence is n ot DHA-IHD (877) GETVACC www.health.mil/vaccines 3 DHA-IHD Information Paper Subject: Influenza Vaccines for Adults 65 Years and Older sufficient to recommend any one vaccine over others for this po pulation. d. The DoD Influenza Program bulk procurement provides three recommended vaccines for people aged 65 years and older: FluLav al (IIV4, 6 months), Fluarix (IIV4 , 6 Afluria (IIV4, months).
