People who swear more often may be more trustworthy, according to a three-part [study](https://www.academia.edu/29725191/Frankly_we_do_give_a_damn_The_relationship_between_profanity_and_honesty) published in Social Psychological and Personality Science. For the first study, researchers from Maastricht University in the Netherlands asked 276 people to list their favorite swear words, disclose how much they swear every day, share the emotions they feel when they use those swear words, and complete a psychological survey to assess their honesty.

Overall, based on all three studies, the researchers found that \"at both the individual and society level, ... a higher rate of profanity use was associated with more honesty.\" [The 'sugar coma' just might be real](https://www.psypost.org/2018/01/study-suggests-sugar-coma-real-glucose-ingestion-leads-worse-cognitive-performance-50514).

For the study, researchers had 49 participants consume drinks sweetened with glucose, sucrose, fructose, or sucralose and then complete three cognitive tests while their glucose levels were monitored. The researchers found that the participants who had consumed either glucose or sucrose performed worse on the cognitive tests than those who had consumed fructose or sucralose. According to Mei Peng, a lecturer at the University of Otago and study author, the results of the study suggest \"that the 'sugar coma'\u2014with regards to glucose\u2014is indeed a real phenomenon, where levels of attention seem to decline after consumption of glucose-containing sugar.\" [Avocado toast is out, WSJ reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-foods-well-eatand-shunthis-year-1515000523?mg=prod/accounts-wsj).
