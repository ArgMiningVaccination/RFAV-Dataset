The extended warranty market is highly protable,1 and has caught the attention of consumer protection and competition authorities in dierent countries. In the UK, the Oce of Fair Trading observed that \"there is insucient competition and information to ensure that consumers get good value\" in the extended warranty market, and that \"many electrical retailers may make considerable prots on the sale of extended warranties\" (UK Competition Com- mission, 2003). The UK Competition Commission has consequently conducted a comprehensive investigation of this market. Its report expressed concerns about the lack of market competition due to the way warranties are sold, and the lack of available information at the point of sale about the reliability of the insured product and the cost of repair (UK Competition Commission, 2003). The Federal Trade Commission in the US has also looked into this market, and is advising consumers to obtain information about the likelihood of product failure and the potential cost of repair before buying an extended warranty.2 This paper uses panel and experimental data to analyze market competition and consumer behavior in the extended warranty market. The rst takeaway from the analysis is that the strong demand and high prots in this market are driven by consumers distorting the failure probability of the insured product, rather than standard risk aversion or sellers' market power. The second takeaway is that providing information to consumers about failure probabilities signicantly reduces their willingness to pay for warranties, indicating the important role of information, or lack of, in driving consumers' purchase behavior. The third takeaway is that such information provision is more eective in enhancing consumer welfare than additional market competition, highlighting the relevance of policies that guide consumers' decision making directly. The starting point of our analysis is that the market for extended warranties is characterized by market power on the supply side and high willingness to pay on the demand side. On the supply side, sellers have market power because the warranty is an add-on product. It is usually oered to consumers immediately after they nalize their decision to buy the insured product,3 at a stage in which searching for another product or switching to another seller is costly. This search and switching cost implies signicant market power a l` a Ellison's (2005) add-on pricing model.4 1The UK Competition Commission (2003) estimates that the top ve consumer electronics retailers in the UK earned 116 to 152 million pounds annually on the sale of extended warranties in the early 2000s. Similarly, analysts in the US estimate extended warranties accounted for almost half of BestBuy's operating income in 2003, and that prot margins on warranties ranged from 50% to 60% (\"The Warranty Windfall,\" Business Week (December 19, 2004)). 2See https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0240-extended-warranties-and-service-contracts (accessed on June 15, 2018). 3For example, BestBuy trains its sales people to oer warranties to consumers only af- ter they nalize the TV purchase decision. For BestBuy's presentation of selling skills, see https://www.extendingthereach.com/wps/PA VCorationFramework/resource?argumentRef=static&resourceRef=/les/Best Buy Vendor Selling Skills.pdf (accessed on June 15, 2018). 4According to the UK Competition Commission (2003), \"Most customers shop around for electronic goods; the retail price is a major factor in their choice. However, extended warranty buyers do not often plan to buy an extended 2 On the demand side, about one in four TV buyers in our panel data purchases an extended warranty. On average, this buyer pays $90 or more to insure against a loss of at most $400 with 7% probability. What drives this high willingness to pay? Sydnor (2010) uses data on home insurance deductible choices to show standard risk aversion in the form of diminishing marginal utility for wealth cannot explain consumers' high willingness to pay for reductions in deductibles. Sydnor (2010) proposes several alternative explanations for the high willingness to pay, including misperception of claim probabilities and reference-dependent preferences. Barseghyan et al. (2013) examine several alternatives to standard risk aversion, and conclude that upward distortion of claim probabilities plays a key role in explaining deductible choices in home and auto insurance. Our rst objective is to quantify the importance of probability distortions and standard risk aversion on the demand side relative to market power on the supply side in determining demand, prices, and prots in the extended warranty market. To do so, we consider a model of market competition based on Ellison's (2005) add-on pricing game to which we incorporate Barseghyan et al.'s (2013) decision-making model, in which consumers are assumed to be risk-averse expected utility maximizers who may distort failure probabilities. We then use panel data on household-level product and extended warranty purchases from a large US electronics retailer to estimate consumers' risk-aversion and probability-distortion parameters and the retailer's cost of selling and servicing the warranty. The panel data documents approximately 45,000 transactions made by almost 20,000 households between 1998 and 2004. Almost 30% of the transactions involved the purchase of an extended warranty. Our structural estimation focuses on TVs, which constitute about 11% of the data, due to the availability of TV failure rates from Consumer Reports. Variation in repair costs for dierent products with the same failure rate enables us to sepa- rately identify the risk-aversion and probability-distortion parameters. Intuitively, either parameter can explain the willingness to pay for a warranty to any given product. But they have dierent predictions regarding the rate at which willingness to pay changes in response to a change in the repair cost. In particular, probability distortion implies a slower rate than risk aversion. Thus, xing the failure rate, changes in willingness to pay in response to changes in repair costs enable us to separately identify the two parameters. Our estimation indicates there is a substantial upward distortion of failure probabilities. For example, a 5% objective failure probability is perceived as a 13% failure probability. This estimate is similar to the estimate of Barseghyan et al. (2013) and to results from our experiment described below. Standard risk aversion, on the other hand, plays an insignicant role in consumers' decision making. The estimated risk-aversion parameter implies willingness to pay is close to actuarially fair rates in the absence of probability distortion. We use counterfactual analysis to quantify the eect of probability distortions on market out- warranty (less than half of consumers who bought an extended warranty said that they had planned to do so before they went into the store), and many are unaware of the existence of alternatives to taking the EW oered at the point of sale.\" 3 comes. Specically, we compare outcomes in the existing market with outcomes in a counterfactual market in which retailers have the same market power but the distortion is \"shut down\" in the sense that consumers use objective failure probabilities in decision making. A key assumption in the analysis is that TVs are priced similarly whether consumers distort failure probabilities or not. As discussed in section 7, this assumption is supported by comparing TV prices between retailers who oer extended warranties and retailers who do not, institutional details, and Ellison's (2005) results. The counterfactual analysis demonstrates that probability distortions drive the strong demand and high prots, whereas market power drives the high prices and margins. Specically, when shutting down probability distortions, volume and prot decrease by more than 90%, but price and margin decrease by only 4% and 11%, respectively. Our second objective is to better understand the mechanism for the distortion. One possible mechanism is that consumers know the objective probabilities but overweigh them as predicted by Prospect Theory (Kahneman and Tversky (1979)). Another possible mechanism \u2014 which seems to t the concerns of competition authorities \u2014 is that consumers lack information about the objective probabilities and overestimate them. Bordalo et al.'s (2015) theory of attention proposes a possible reason for overestimation: consumers are surprised when reminded by the sales person that TVs can break, and overreact to this information.5 Understanding the mechanism is welfare-and policy-relevant. If the distortion stems from lack of information about failure probabilities, as postulated by the second mechanism, consumer welfare should be evaluated with respect to the objective probabilities, and room exists for policies that inform consumers about these probabilities. On the other hand, if consumers know the probabilities and distort them in their decision making, deciding whether objective or distorted probabilities should be used in welfare analysis depends on whether one interprets overweighting as a deliberate process or as a mistake in decision making.6 To study the mechanism, we conducted experiments. In a pretest with approximately 500 participants, we found the failure rate in the pool of participants was about 5%. This rate is similar to the failure rates reported by Consumer Reports. In the rst main experiment with approximately 1,000 participants who did not participate in the pretest, we randomly assigned participants to one of three treatments. In two treatments, we elicited participants' perceived TV failure probability and their willingness to pay for an extended warranty, and in the third, we rst informed participants about the objective probability and then elicited their willingness to pay. We found that average perceived TV failure probability among 5Possible support for Bordalo et al.'s (2015) theory comes from the comparison of the strong in-store demand with the weak online demand in the data (see section 2.3.) Indeed, making TV failures salient and triggering overreaction seems harder in the online marketplace than in the store, where the sales person has the buyer's attention, and can press the buyer to make a quick decision. 6This mechanism-based approach to welfare analysis is based on Rubinstein and Salant (2008, 2012) who argue behavioral welfare analysis should rely on understanding the mechanism that maps the decision maker's preferences to his choices. 4 uninformed participants was about 14%, which is almost three times larger than the objective fail- ure rate. Moreover, the average willingness to pay among informed participants was much lower than among uninformed participants. For example, the median willingness to pay among informed participants was about half of the median willingness to pay among uninformed participants. We interpret these ndings as suggesting that lack of information about failure probabilities is a rel- evant factor in creating the distortion, and that information provision reduces willingness to pay signicantly. In the second experiment with another 900 participants, we examined whether traces of prob- ability distortion were present among informed participants. Specically, we elicited informed participants' willingness to pay for TVs with the same failure rate but with dierent repair costs, and used the identication strategy of the empirical analysis to separately identify the risk aversion and probability distortion parameters from the reported willingness to pay. We found that most participants displayed modest or no probability distortion as well as no risk aversion. We interpret these ndings as indicating information provision reduces the distortion signicantly. Equipped with the experimental ndings, our third objective is to evaluate consumer welfare and the eectiveness of various policy interventions based on the panel data. We rst observe that welfare in the existing market is negative, i.e., consumer welfare would increase if the market for warranties did not exist. This is because any positive welfare generated by warranty purchases of buyers with true willingness to pay above price is dominated by the decrease in welfare due to warranty purchases of buyers with true willingness to pay below price who overestimate failure probabilities. As for policy, Armstrong (2008) discusses two broad categories of policies competition author- ities use to enhance market performance and consumer welfare. The rst and more prominent category includes competition policies, which target the supply side of the market and aim to in- tensify competition. The second category includes consumer policies, which target the demand side and aim to enhance consumers' decision making directly. An example of a competition policy in the extended warranty market is the UK Competition Commission's (2003) proposal that retailers advertise and post the price of the warranty alongside the price of the product it insures. This policy is expected to drive down prices because it reduces the search and switching costs of consumers. If the demand for warranties were driven solely by consumers' risk aversion, such a price reduction would have a positive eect on consumer welfare. It would increase the utility of existing warranty buyers as well as the utility of new buyers, who now purchase the warranty because of the lower prices. But with overestimation, the utility of new buyers may be negative, and so the eect of price reduction on consumer welfare is unclear. On the other hand, a consumer policy that reduces overestimation increases consumer welfare, assuming no price change, because consumers make better choices, but may trigger a price change, and so its eect is also unclear. An example of a consumer policy is to demand retailers to disclose failure probabilities to consumers, similar to what we did in the experiment. 5 Counterfactual analysis demonstrates that consumer policies that reduce overestimation are more eective in enhancing consumer welfare than competition policies that lead to price reduction. Intuitively, when warranty prices go down but overestimation still exists, consumer welfare decreases because the welfare gain due to lower prices is dominated by the welfare loss generated by more consumers buying warranties due to overestimation. On the other hand, when overestimation goes down, consumer welfare increases because the welfare gain due to consumers making better choices dominates any other eect. Thus, our ndings indicate competition policies may lead to suboptimal results in markets with uninformed or biased consumers relative to consumer policies that aim to improve consumers' decision making directly. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1.1 reviews the related literature. Section 2 presents the panel data and reports empirical regularities on household purchase behavior. Section 3 presents the model and the identication strategy. Section 4 describes the estimation procedure. Section 5 reports the results of the estimation. Section 6 studies the mechanism for the distortion. Section 7 studies the importance of probability distortions relative to market power in determining demand, prices, prot, and consumer welfare. Section 8 concludes with a discussion of policy implications. 1.1 Related literature This paper is related to the empirical literature on estimating risk preferences (see Barseghyan et al. (forthcoming) for a recent survey.) Cohen and Einav (2007) use data on auto insurance deductible choices to estimate a structural model of individual choice with standard risk aversion. They nd unobserved heterogeneity in risk aversion is greater than unobserved heterogeneity in risk (claim rates), and that the two are positively correlated. Barseghyan et al. (2011) compare households' degree of standard risk aversion in auto and home insurance. They nd risk preferences are not stable across contexts, and that many households exhibit greater risk aversion in their home deductible choices than in their auto deductible choices. Sydnor (2010) uses home insurance deductible choices to demonstrate that consumers' will- ingness to pay for insurance is very high. For example, many consumers pay $100 to lower their deductible from $1,000 to $500 when their (ex-post) claim rate is less than 5%. Sydnor (2010) shows that tting such choices to a model with standard risk aversion yields extreme levels of risk aversion, and proposes several alternative explanations for the high willingness to pay, including misperception of claim rates and reference-dependent preferences. Our paper is closest to Barseghyan et al. (2013), who develop a structural model of individ- ual choice with standard risk aversion and probability distortions, and estimate it using data on auto and home insurance deductible choices. Barseghyan et al. (2013) nd upward distortion of claim probabilities plays a key role in explaining deductible choices. Moreover, the shape of the probability-distortion function ts the shape predicted by Prospect Theory (Kahneman and Tversky (1979)). Several other papers incorporate probability distortions to the estimation of risk 6 2 preferences, and nd evidence of their relevance in various contexts, including nancial markets (Kliger and Levy (2009)) and betting markets (Jullien and Salani\u00b4 e (2000), Snowberg and Wolfers (2010), Chiappori et al. (2012), Gandhi and Serrano-Padial (2014)). We make three contributions to this literature. First, we quantify the eect of probability distortions, relative to market power and risk aversion, on prices, volume, and prot. We are able to make progress on this question because electronics retailers have (1) monopolistic power when selling warranties, which facilitates cost estimation, and (2) little flexibility in cutting TV prices below cost, which facilitates the counterfactual analysis. Second, we use experimental data to show the distortion stems from lack of information about failure probabilities. This contribution is important for welfare analysis and the evaluation of policy interventions. Third, we demonstrate that consumer policies are more eective than competition policies in improving consumer welfare. Another related literature is the marketing and experimental literature on why consumers buy extended warranties (Chen et al. (2009), Huysentruyt and Read (2010), Jindal (2014)). Chen et al. (2009) use purchase data of about 600 households from an unspecied US electronics retailer over the period November 2003 to October 2004 to study how the insured product characteristics (hedonic vs. utilitarian) and marketing actions by retailers aect the likelihood of purchasing an extended warranty. Huysentruyt and Read (2010) use survey data to demonstrate that participants overestimate the likelihood of washing-machine breakdowns and their cost of repair. Jindal (2014) uses dierent survey data to highlight the role of loss aversion in the context of extended warranties for washing machines. The four-year failure probability of washing machines is 20% to 30%, so probability distortions are expected to have a less signicant role in this context. We contribute to this literature by demonstrating that lack of information about failure probabilities is a relevant factor in creating the distortion, and that information provision signicantly reduces the distortion. Data This section describes the panel data. We use the INFORMS Society of Marketing Science Durables Dataset 1, which is a panel data of household durable-goods transactions from a major US electronics retailer. The full sample contains approximately 140,000 product-level transactions made by almost 20,000 households across the retailer's 1,176 outlets and its online store. Prices across outlets and the online store are essentially identical. Transactions took place between December 1998 and November 2004. The data contains four main types of transactions. About 117,000 transactions involve the purchase of a specic product other than an extended warranty. About 15,000 transactions involve the purchase of an extended warranty. About 5,000 transactions involve the return of a product other than an extended warranty, and about 1,000 transactions involve the return of an extended warranty. For each transaction, we observe the product ID, the price of the product, the brand, and the category and subcategory of the product. 7 A shopping trip is a collection of transactions made by a given household at a given store at a given date and time. For each household and shopping trip, we observe the buyer's gender, the age and gender of the head of the household, income group7, and whether there are children in the household. There are three data issues that we have to deal with. First, the data only tells us the product subcategory (e.g., 9-16 inch TVs) the warranty is for. We restrict our sample to shopping trips in which a one-to-one mapping exists between the extended warranty and the corresponding product. For example, we drop shopping trips involving a purchase of two 9-16 inch TVs but only one extended warranty purchased for this subcategory. We lose approximately 2,000 observations for this reason. Second, if a household did not purchase an extended warranty for a given product, we do not observe the warranty's price. To identify the warranty price in such cases, we match the non- warranty transaction with a corresponding warranty transaction for the same product ID from the closest transaction date. After dropping transactions for which we cannot nd a corresponding warranty transaction, we end up with a sample of approximately 45,000 observations.8 Third, for the structural estimation, we need information about the insured product failure probability, which is the likelihood that the product will need a repair within three to four years of purchase. We focus on TVs in the estimation, because we are able to obtain TV failure rates from Consumer Reports, which publishes TV failure rates by brand and size every year based on surveys of tens of thousands of TV owners. We use the failure rates from the 2004 report, which is based on the responses of more than 100,000 TV owners between 1998 and 2002. 2.1 Attachment rates, prices, and approximate prot margins Table 1 shows the fraction of consumers who bought extended warranties (henceforth, the attach- ment rate) and the extended-warranty-to-product price ratio for each product category. Attachment rates range from about 20% for items such as VCRs (VIDEO HDWR), music CDs, and video games (MUSIC), to as high as 40% for items such as car stereos and speakers (MOBILE). Warranties are priced on average at 24% of the price of the insured product, and the standard deviation of the warranty-to-product price ratio is 11% (see Panel A in Figure 1 for the distribution of ratios.) No signicant correlation at the product level exists between variations in the product price and variations in the warranty price.9 Table 2 reports TV attachment rates, prices, warranty-to-product price ratios, and failure rates broken down by TV subcategory. Attachment rates range from 15% to 35%, with higher attachment 7Income group is a number from 1 to 9, where 9 is the highest income group. We do not have additional information on income within each group. 8We also drop the less than 1,000 observations in which the price of the good is signicantly less than the price of the warranty. 9We regress the log of the product price on the log of the warranty price for each product, and estimate an average coecient equal to 0.046 with an average p-value of 0.26. 8 Table 1: Attachment rate and price ratio by product category Attachment rate EW-Product price ratio Obs averages. rates and EW-Product price ratios are sales- Table 2: EW information for TVs Attach rate TV price EW-TV price ratio Fail rate Consumer Reports . Overall numbers are sales-weighted averages. Margin is computed as (EW price - fail rate \u00d7 TV price)/EW price. rates for more expensive categories. The average price ratio for TVs is about 22% with a standard deviation of 8% (see Panel B in Figure 1.) Using the TV price multiplied by the TV failure rate as a rough estimate of the expected cost of servicing a TV warranty, Table 2 also reports a \"back of the envelope\" prot margin on TV warranties. This margin ranges from 62% to 73% for dierent TV subcategories, which is close to what is cited in the popular press. We expect the seller in our dataset to have lower margins due to revenue sharing with warranty providers and commissions to sales people. 2.2 Buyers' characteristics Tables 3 and 4 examine the relationship between attachment rates and buyers' characteristics for all product categories and for TVs. In Table 3, attachment rates are broken down by buyer gender, gender and age of the head of the household, income, and whether there is a child in the household. Income is the only characteristic that is strongly correlated with attachment rates for TVs and all other product categories. For example, when moving from the highest to the lowest income category, TV attachment rates increase by almost 11 percentage points in TV attachment rates. Having a child seems to decrease TV attachment rates by 7 percentage points, but this eect goes 9 Table 3: Attachment rates by buyer and household characteristics All TV Characteristic Attach rate Obs Attach rate Obs Female 0.305 13976 0.286 Above median income (category 5) 0.276 Lowest income category (category = 1) 0.343 2656 0.340 300 Highest income category (category = 9) 0.253 6452 0.233 660 Over 50 (head of 0.323 779 Table 4: Regression of EW purchase dummy on buyer and household characteristics Dependent variable: EW purchase dummy All TV Coe SE Coe SE Male -0.064 (0.039) Both regressions brand and subcategory xed eects.

Table 4 presents the results of regressing an extended warranty purchase dummy on buyers' and households' characteristics and their interactions with gender. The regressions include brand and subcategory xed eects to account for average dierences in purchasing behavior across these dimensions. Consistent with most of the raw means in Table 3, the only characteristic that is sta- tistically and economically signicant is income when all product categories are included. Adjusted R2's are very small despite including subcategory and brand xed eects. All in all, the two tables indicate that other than income, the above characteristics are not strongly correlated with warranty purchases. 10 Table 5: Regression of extended warranty purchase dummy on shopping mode Dependent variable: EW purchase dummy I II III Y Subcategory FE N N Y Y Y BrandFE N N N Y Y MonthFE N N N N Y YearFE N N N N Y No. obs clustered at shopping-trip level. 2.3 In-store versus online transactions About 1% of the transactions in the data were made online. The attachment rate for these trans- actions is about 4%, which is one seventh of the in-store attachment rate. In Table 5, we use regression analysis to examine what drives this dierence and its robustness. The rst model does not include any controls, so it gives numbers that are similar to the raw attachment rates. The other models turn on various xed eects. Subcategory and brand xed eects allow us to soak up any dierences in mean purchasing behavior induced by the nature of the product. We also include household, month, and year xed eects as further controls. We see a drop in the eect of in-store purchases as we add xed eects. Including a household xed eect reduces the eect by about 5 percentage points. Including product-related xed eects reduces the eect by additional 2.5 percentage points. Including all the xed eects leads to a reduction in the eect from 25 to 17 percentage points. That is, the likelihood of purchasing an extended warranty jumps from 12% to 29% when the product is purchased in the store. 2.4 Warranty returns The data contains 1,239 warranty return transactions. About 67% of them are returns that accom- pany the insured product return. These returns are probably made due to the add-on feature of the warranty - it has no value if the insured product is returned. But 33% of the warranty returns are made without returning the main product. We run regressions similar to Table 4 and nd that none of the buyer or household characteristics in the data are strongly correlated with this return behavior. 11 3 Theory We consider an add-on pricing model a l` a Ellison (2005) and Ellison and Ellison (2009) to which we incorporate the consumer model of Barseghyan et al. (2013). There are several sellers of a main product M and an extended warranty EW for the product M. Each seller sets a price p for the product that is observable to buyers, and a price t for the warranty that is not. The assumption that the product price is observable and the warranty price is not seems to be the case in practice. For example, BestBuy advertises product prices but not warranty prices, and trains its sales people to oer warranties and other add-ons to buyers only after they nalize their decision to purchase the product. Buyers decide which seller to visit after observing the price of the product across sellers and forming rational expectations about warranty prices.10 Buyers visit the seller of their choice at a cost s and learn the price of the warranty. The cost s corresponds to the hassle or time involved in visiting a store and going through the purchase process. Buyers then decide whether to buy the main product, the main product and the warranty, or visit another store at a cost of s, where they will face the same decision. Relevant equilibrium properties. As Ellison (2005) shows, any pure strategy sequential equilibrium of the above game has two properties. The rst is that the price of the warranty set by any seller is the monopoly price relative to the demand for warranties among buyers of the product. Otherwise, as in Diamond (1971), the seller can raise the price of the warranty by some \u000f < s, and buyers will not switch to another seller. We use the rst-order condition of the monopoly pricing problem to estimate the seller's cost. The second property is that buyers visit only one seller and always buy the product in equilib- rium, because buyers incur a cost of visiting a seller. Thus, if they anticipate they will not buy the main product, they will not visit the store. We therefore focus below on buyers' decision to buy the warranty conditional on already purchasing the product. Warranty purchase decision. Following Barseghyan et al. (2013), we model buyers as risk-averse expected utility maximizers who may distort failure probabilities. Let W denote the buyer's wealth after buying the main product, t the price of the warranty, and u(\u00b7, r) the buyer's concave utility over wealth levels that is parameterized by r, the buyer's degree of risk aversion around W . A buyer's utility if he purchases the warranty is VEW = u(W t; r).11 If he does not purchase the warranty, his utility is VNW = ()E(u(W X; r)) + (1 ())u(W ; r), where is the failure 10The assumption that buyers form rational expectations about warranty prices is not necessary for our empirical analysis. One could alternatively assume, as in Gabaix and Laibson (2006), that buyers do not plan to purchase a warranty prior to visiting the seller, and decide which seller to visit based solely on the price of the main product. In this alternative specication, buyers form rational expectations about warranty prices of other sellers after visiting the rst seller and being oered the warranty. 11This assumes that there is no deductible associated with using the warranty as is often the case in practice. 12 probability of the product, () is the probability-distortion function, which increases in , and X is the random cost of repair. This specication implies buyers consider failure probabilities sequentially in the sense that they rst consider the total probability of failure () and then the probability of each failure type conditional on a failure occurring. We assume the sum of the conditional probabilities is 1. We also assume the cost of repair is less than the main product price, because the buyer can always buy a new product instead of xing the existing one. Thus, the buyer's utility if he does not purchase the warranty is bounded below by ()u(W p; r) + (1 ())u(W ; r). We will identify VNW with this lower bound in our estimation, i.e., we will have VNW = ()u(W p; r) + (1 ())u(W ; r).12 Demand for warranties. Observationally equivalent households may make dierent purchase decisions based on various unobserved factors such as technical skills to \"do it yourself.\" We account for this unobserved heterogeneity by incorporating additively separable individual choice , and VNW . Assuming these shocks are iid Type I Extreme Value with scale parameter and normalizing the buyer population to 1, we can derive the demand for warranties: D(t; r, (), p, . (2) Identication. rely on the identication assumptions and results of Barseghyan et al. (2013, forthcoming) to uniquely identify the risk-aversion and probability-distortion parameters. Consider a product M with price pM and the failure probability . Let = () denote the distorted probability. The willingness to pay (WTP) of buyers with risk aversion r and the distorted probability for a warranty to product M is the price t that solves VEW (t, r)= VNW (pM , r, ). This WTP can be inferred from choice probabilities given enough variation in extended warranty prices for product M. The identication challenge is that this WTP can be explained by a continuum of pairs (r, (r)), where r is the degree of risk aversion and (r) is the distorted probability as a function of r. This is because any increase in the degree of risk aversion r can be undone by a decrease in the probability distortion . Suppose now that we observe another product M0 with the same failure probability but a dierent price pM0 . Because the failure probability is the same, the same pair (r, ) should explain the dierent WTPs for warranties to products M and M0 . The pair (r, ) can then be identied uniquely if the two iso-WTP \"curves\", i.e., the two continuums of pairs (r, (r)) that explain the 12Section 5 discusses the robustness of our estimates to alternative cost specications. 13The utility specication we use in estimation imposes a specic normalization so we can identify the scale parameter . This scale parameter is the inverse of the marginal utility of income. 13 4 dierent WTPs, cross each other exactly once. Figure 2 provides graphical intuition. The solid curve is the iso-WTP curve for product M with price pM . Without additional variation, we cannot uniquely identify the pair (r, ) against the pair (r0, 0), because the two pairs lie on the same iso-WTP curve, and so can rationalize the same WTP. However, if we also observe the WTP for product M0, the pair (r, ) can be uniquely identied as long as the iso-WTP curve for product M0 (the dashed curve in Figure 2) crosses the iso-WTP curve for product M exactly once. Barseghyan et al. (forthcoming) establish this single-crossing property holds under what they call Assumption 1. Assumption 1 essentially requires that for any three wealth levels W0 > W 1 > u(W 1;r)u(W 2;r)W2, the ratio is strictly increasing in r. This condition holds for CARA, CRRA, u(W 0;r)u(W 1;r) and the utility specication we use in the estimation. Estimation This section describes the estimation strategy, which is composed of two stages. In the rst stage, we use choice data to estimate the risk-aversion and probability-distortion parameters. In the second stage, we use the demand elasticities implied by the rst-stage estimation to back out the retailer's marginal cost cj of selling and serving a warranty for product j. Specically, we back out cj from the rst-order condition of the retailer's prot-maximization problem, which is given by tj cj 1 = , (3)tj |E(tj ; r, (), p j , E(tj ; r, (), p j , ) is the price elasticity of demand for warranties for product j. The rest of this section focuses on describing the demand-side estimation in detail. In specifying the utility of consumers, we follow Cohen and Einav (2007), Barseghyan et al. (2011), and Barseghyan et al. (2013), and use a second-order Taylor approximation of consumers' utility function u(\u00b7). The main benet of using this specication is that it does not require data on wealth. The second-order Taylor approximation of u(\u00b7) around W for some wealth deviation is given by 00(W ) uu(W + ) u(W )+ . 2 Dividing ) Using this specication to evaluate the utility dierence j between purchasing and not purchasing 14 a warranty for product j (equation (2)), we obtain that . (j p t)j j We consider both a parametric and a non-parametric specication of the probability-distortion function. Parametric specication. A common way to model a single-parameter probability-distortion function is to use the Prelec (1998) functional form () = exp[( log())], 2 where (0, 1) is the parameter of interest, and larger values of reflect a smaller distortion.14 2 In this specication, j pj tj + r 2j = 2 2((j )p t)j j Following Berry (1994), we add to j (, r, ) a product-specic error term j with E(j |pj , tj )= 0. This error term can be thought of as reflecting product-specic variation in the value of pur- chasing a warranty that is unobserved to the econometrician and is orthogonal to the product and warranty prices. Letting Dj denote the attachment rate for product j, we can now invert the structural equation (1) that relates the observed \"market share\" Dj and the theoretical market share j (, r, )+ j to obtain the estimating equation Djlog = j(, r, )+ j,1 Dj and use nonlinear least squares to estimate the parameters (, r, ). Note the estimating equation has a single product price pj and a single warranty price tj for every product j. The data, however, has within-product variation in these prices. Because there is insucient data to create market shares for every pair of prices, we do not use the within-product variation in the estimation. Rather, our main specication uses the highest product price pj and the lowest warranty price tj for product j, thus making warranty purchases more attractive even without referring to probability distortion or risk aversion. We examine the robustness of the parametric estimates to alternative specications that use average prices or within-product price variation in Section 5.3. Nonparametric distortion. The nonparametric specication assumes the probability distor- tion has the form j = (j )+ j , (4) Note that the Prelec function is used in the literature to model situations in which consumers know the relevant probabilities, whereas in our setting they may not. 2(j )pj tj + r j = j (, r, ) . 15 145 where j is the failure probability of product j, (\u00b7) is some unknown function, and j is a product- specic noise in the probability distortion. We assume the expected value of j is zero conditional on a given failure probability and TV and extended warranty prices in the same subcategory. Using the same inversion strategy as in Berry (1994) and rearranging, we express the j as a function of the unknown parameters (r, ) and the data: log Dj + tj + r t2 1D j 2 jj = . (5)2pj + 2 r pj The estimation then proceeds in two steps. We rst construct moment conditions involving j and use them to estimate r and . We then use the estimated r and and the data to back out the nonparametric estimates of j from equation (5). To construct the moment conditions, we x a product subcategory, for example, 30\" or larger TVs, and consider two products j and j0 in this subcategory with the same failure probability. The dierence between the respective 's is j j0 = j j0 . Because the expected value of is zero, we obtain the moment condition E[j j0 Moreover, because prices are assumed to be orthogonal to the dierence between 's in the sub- category, we also obtain the expected value of (j j0 )P where P {pj , pj0 , tj , tj0 } is also zero. Thus, we have ve moment conditions. In each of them, we replace the 's with the right- hand side of equation (5) and use the generalized method of moments to estimate r and . The estimation requires that each pair of products we consider is from the same subcategory and shares the same failure probability. We have 2,040 such pairs in the data. Results This section reports the estimates of the probability-distortion function, the risk-aversion parame- ter, and the seller's cost. 5.1 The relevance of probability distortions Figure 3 plots of the estimated one-parameter Prelec (1998) function () = exp[( log())]. The estimated to be with a 95% condence interval of (0.6887,0.6902). The gure also includes a scatter plot of the estimated non-parametric j 's and a local linear t based on the non-parametric values with a bootstrapped 95% pointwise condence band around it. Table 6 presents the non-parametric estimates from a dierent perspective. It partitions failure probabilities to bins of 2%. For each bin, it reports the average failure probability and the average estimated distorted probability in the bin. It also reports the convexity measure ((0)())/(0 16 Table 6: Estimates of probability distortion Fail prob intervals Average fail prob Average distorted prob Convexity measure 4-6 5.0 13.5 \u2014 6-8 6.8 16.5 1.7 8-10 9.3 17.5 0.4 10 13.4 17.9 0.1 Notes: Columns 1,2, and 3 are in %. In column 1, the upper bound is not included in the bin. ), where 0 > are two adjacent average failure probabilities in the table. This convexity measure is the increment in the average distortion divided by the increment in the average failure probability. Two patterns emerge in Figure 3 and Table 6. First, there is substantial upward distortion of failure probabilities. This is illustrated in Figure 3 by the estimated Prelec function, most of the estimated wj 's, the local linear t, and the 95% condence band, all lying above the 45-degree line. This is also illustrated in Table 6 where, for example, products with an average failure probability of 5% are perceived as products with a 13.5% failure probability. Second, the degree of the upward distortion decreases as the failure probability increases. This is illustrated in Figure 3 by the concavity of the local linear t, and in Table 6 by the decrease in the convexity measure. These two patterns are in line with the ndings of Barseghyan et al. (2013). 5.2 The irrelevance of risk aversion The estimate of the risk-aversion parameter r is close to zero in both the parametric and non- parametric specications of the distortion function. In both specications, it is less than 106 and is not statistically dierent from zero. To interpret the relative importance of the estimated parameters, Table 7 presents the implied WTP for an extended warranty to a TV that costs $400 under various failure probabilities.15 In column 2, we calculate WTP with the estimated one-parameter distortion function and the estimated risk-aversion parameter. In column 3, we calculate WTP using the same risk-aversion parameter while imposing ()= . The comparison of WTPs across the two columns indicates the contribution of probability distortion to WTP is signicantly larger than that of standard risk aversion. Moreover, when the probability distortion is turned o (column 3), WTP is essentially equal to the actuarially fair rate. The estimation \"favors\" the probability distortion explanation over the risk-aversion explana- tion, because probability distortion implies \u2014 in line with the data \u2014 smaller variations in WTP in response to variations in repair cost than the variations in WTP implied by risk aversion. To see this, consider a situation in which the repair cost increases at a constant rate while the failure probability remains xed. Probability distortion without risk aversion implies WTP increases at a constant rate, whereas risk aversion without probability distortion implies WTP increases at an increasing rate. For example, if the failure probability is 5%, the repair cost is $400, and the WTP 15In calculating WTP, all the error terms are set to zero. 17 Table 7: WTP for EW on a good that costs $400 Failure prob Model estimates Model estimates imposing () a warranty is $60, then the WTP can be explained by either =0.15 and no risk aversion or by r =0.018 and no probability distortion. As the repair cost increases, the WTP in the model with probability distortion increases at a constant rate of . So if the repair cost increases to $500, WTP increases to $75, and if the repair cost increases to $600, WTP increases to $90. The WTP in the model with risk aversion increases at a faster rate. If the repair cost increases to $500, WTP increases to $79, and if the repair cost increases to $600, WTP increases to $101. Thus, although either probability distortion or risk aversion can explain the WTP for a single product, the rate at which WTP changes in response to a change in the repair cost favors probability distortion. Another source of variation that favors probability distortion over risk aversion is the variation in WTP in response to changes in failure probability. Recall that we assume in the parametric specication \u2014 and infer from the estimates in the non-parametric specication \u2014 that the distor- tion function is concave for the relevant range of failure probabilities. Now consider a situation in which the repair cost is xed and the failure probability increases at a constant rate. Probability distortion without risk aversion implies WTP increases at a decreasing rate, whereas risk aversion without probability distortion implies WTP increases at a constant rate. Thus, similar to the repair cost, the slower rate at which WTP changes in response to changes in the failure probability in the data favors probability distortion. 5.3 Robustness of demand-side estimates The estimates of the probability-distortion and risk-aversion parameters are robust to the following alternative specications (see Tables 8 and 9 for a comparison of the parameter estimates across specications.) Average prices. The main specication uses the highest product price and the lowest warranty price in the estimation. We reestimate the parametric model using the average product and warranty prices. It is expected that the estimated parameters will reflect either a larger probability distortion (smaller ) or more aversion to risk (larger r) relative to the main specication, because warranty purchases become less attractive as warranty prices increase or product prices decrease. Table 8 demonstrates that the estimated distortion parameter is indeed smaller than in the 18 Table 8: Parameter estimates across specications Prelec Risk aversion 8.7475 (0.6887,0.6902) < 10.3010 (0.5812,0.5829) (106 106) below estimates. main specication, reflecting a larger probability distortion. For example, a 5% failure probability is perceived as a 15.1% probability when using average prices relative to 11.9% in the main parametric specication. The estimate of the risk-aversion parameter remains close to zero, reflecting its insignicance. Maximum Likelihood. The main specication only uses between-product variation in prices. An alternative estimation method that uses both within-product and between-product variation in prices is Maximum Likelihood (ML). Consider a consumer i who faces a price pij for product j, a price tij for a warranty for product j, and choice shocks to VEW and VNW that are iid Type I Extreme Value with scale parameter . The probability that consumer i purchases a warranty for product j is given by exp ijLij = ,1 + exp ij where . Letting dij denote whether consumer i purchased a warranty to product j (dij = 1) or not (dij = 0), and summing over all pairs (i, j), such that consumer i bought product j, we obtain the log-likelihood function, X {dij log Lij )} , (i,j) that we maximize. Similar to the case of using average prices, it is expected that the ML estimated parameters will reflect either a larger probability distortion (smaller ) or more aversion to risk (larger r) relative to the main specication. This is because ML uses variation in both the product price and the warranty price, whereas the main specication uses the highest product price and the lowest warranty price. Table 8 demonstrates that the estimated distortion parameter is smaller than in the main specication, reflecting a larger probability distortion, and is similar to the estimate in the main 19 specication with average prices. The estimate of the risk-aversion parameter remains close to zero, as in the other specications. CARA utility. The main specication uses a second-order Taylor approximation of the utility function. An alternative specication that does not require data on wealth is CARA: 1 exp(r(W + )) u(W +) = . r We reestimate the model with this alternative specication using the highest product price and the lowest warranty price. As Table 8 indicates, we obtain a value of that is similar to the main specication, and a risk-aversion parameter that is not statistically dierent from 0. Repair cost. The utility from not buying a warranty, VNW , depends on the distribution of the repair cost X. The main specication assumes away this dependence by bounding X from above with the main product price, thus making the purchase of a warranty more attractive without refer- ring to risk aversion or probability distortion. However, this assumption may aect the estimates of the probability-distortion and risk-aversion parameters dierently. We now consider alternative cost specications to verify this is not the case. Assume the repair cost X is distributed on the interval [0, p], where p is the main product price. Without loss of generality, let X be equal to p, where is a random variable with support in [0, 1]. Using the second-order approximation of consumers' utility, we can write VNW as a function of the rst two moments of the repair-cost distribution (ignoring the constant term u(W )): r VNW = ()pE()+ ()p 2[V ar()+ E()2]. 2 Thus, knowing the mean and variance of is sucient to compute the utility dierence . Letting \u00b5 denote the expected value of , variance 2 of is bounded above by \u00b5(1 \u00b5)\u00b5 because is distributed on [0, 1] and the largest variance is obtained when the probability mass is concentrated at the end points of the interval. Thus, to check the robustness of the estimates to the cost specication, it suces to re-estimate the model for all 2 \u00b5 [0, \u00b5(1 \u00b5)]. across all combinations of mean and variance, the eect of the variance on the parameter estimates is negligible, suggesting that it suces to examine specications in which consumers perceive the repair as a deterministic fraction of the product price. Table 9 reports the estimates of the probability-distortion and risk-aversion parameters for various fractions. As the table shows, when the repair cost decreases and thus purchasing a warranty becomes less attractive, the estimated magnitude of the distortion increases, but the risk-aversion parameter continues to be irrelevant. 20 Table 9: Parameter estimates with varying repair cost % of product price Prelec Risk aversion r (0.05) 100% 0.689 Prelec parameter is constrained to be weakly greater than 0. This constraint binds between 30% and 40%. 5.4 Retailer's cost Figure 4 presents a scatter plot of the non-parametric cost estimates divided by the corresponding TV prices, and a local linear t with a bootstrapped 95% condence band. For the purpose of the counterfactual analysis, we also t the non-parametric cost ratios with the polynomial \u00b50 + \u00b51 + \u00b522 . As Figure 4 illustrates, the tted polynomial 0.04+1.32 2.482 is essentially identical to the local linear t. Using the quadratic t, we estimate that the retailer's cost, which includes commissions to sales people and revenue sharing with warranty providers, is about 54% of the price of the warranty and that the retailer's prot margin is about 46%. 5.5 Model t We examine how well the model and the estimates t the data by comparing attachment rates and warranty prices predicted by the model to those in the data. The prices used in the comparison are the ones used in the main specication, namely, the highest product price and the lowest warranty price. To compute predicted attachment rates at the product level, we plug into equation (1) the non- parametric estimate of the probability-distortion function, the estimated risk-aversion and scale parameters, and the observed TV and warranty prices from the data. The model predicts a mean attachment rate of 0.276, which is similar to the 0.268 mean attachment rate in the data. Figure 5 depicts that the distributions of the predicted and observed attachment rates are also similar. To compute the predicted warranty prices, we construct the demand for warranties at the product level based on the non-parametric estimates of the distortion function, estimated risk- aversion and scale parameters, and the observed TV prices from the data. Using this demand and the non-parametric cost estimate, we derive the retailer's prot-maximizing warranty price. The model predicts a mean warranty-to-product price ratio of 0.175, which is similar to the 0.171 price ratio in the data.16 Figure 6 depicts that the distributions of the predicted and observed price 16Note these price ratios are smaller than the 0.223 price ratio in Table 2 because of the choice of observed prices. 21 6 ratios are also similar. What Drives Probability Distortions? This section studies the mechanism for the upward distortion of failure probabilities, an important step in evaluating consumer welfare and various policy tools that aim to improve consumer welfare. One possible mechanism is misperception of unknown probabilities. Uninformed consumers overestimate failure probabilities, and hence are willing to pay for warranties more than they would if they knew these probabilities. Another possible mechanism is overweighting of known small probabilities. Prospect Theory (Kahneman and Tversky (1979)) proposes that individuals incorporate probabilities in decision making by using decision weights, and in particular, assign high decision weights to low probability events. Of course, a combination of the two mechanisms might also drive the distortion. We use a pretest and two main experiments to study the mechanism. The pretest elicits TV failure rates in the population of participants. The rst main experiment elicits the WTP for warranties of uninformed participants, who do not receive information about the failure rate from the pretest, and informed participants, who do. It also elicits the perceived failure probability of uninformed participants. The main takeaway from this experiment is that uninformed participants overestimate failure probabilities, and that their WTP is much higher than the WTP of informed participants. The second main experiment studies whether informed participants distort failure probabilities, an indication for probability overweighting. It elicits informed participants' WTP for warranties for dierent TVs with the same failure rate, and uses the empirical strategy of Section 4 to estimate the degree of probability distortion and standard risk aversion post information provision. The main takeaway from this experiment is that there is a mild distortion of failure probabilities post information provision. In all experiments, we use the Mechanical-Turk (M-Turk) platform. We recruited participants who performed at least 500 tasks on M-Turk prior to each experiment, and had an approval rating of 90% or more. About 56% of the participants were males, 43% were females, and 1% preferred not to specify their gender. The median age bracket in the sample was 25-34 years and the median household annual income bracket was $40,000-49,999. The distributions of age and household income brackets appear in Figure 7. Each participant participated in one experiment and was randomly assigned to one treatment in the experiment. 6.1 Pretest This experiment elicits failure rates in the population of participants. Participants (N = 504) were invited to participate in an experiment about TVs. We expected the experiment would take up to two minutes to complete and promised a payment of 25 cents for 22 Table 10: TV Repair rates 2015 2016 2017 Average # Bought 193 206 116 \u2014 # Needed repair 8 12 5 \u2014 Implied fail rate 4.1% 5.8% 4.3% 4.9% participation. We rst asked participants if they had bought a TV in the past three years. Those who responded positively were asked to report, for each TV they bought, the year they bought it (2015, 2016, or 2017)17 and whether it had needed a repair by a technician. About 72% of the participants reported they had bought a TV in the past three years. From among them, about 64% reported they had bought one TV, 28% that they had bought two TVs, and the rest three or more. Table 10 reports that failure rates across years range between 4% and 6%, and that the average failure rate is 4.9%. This number is similar to the failure rates in Consumer Reports. Consumer Reports surveyed the performance of 23 major TV brands in early 2017 based on a sample of more than 100,000 TV owners between 2011 and 2016. The mean and the median three-year failure rates by brand are 5%, with 17 out of the 23 brands having a failure rate of 2% to 5%, 5 brands having failure rates of 6% to 7%, and the remaining brand (Spectre) having a failure rate of 10%. 6.2 Experiment 1 This experiment elicits the WTP for warranties of uninformed participants, who do not receive information about the failure rate from the pretest, and informed participants, who do. It also elicits the perceived failure probability among uninformed participants. We expected the experiment would take up to three minutes to complete, and promised a payment of 40 cents for participation. At the beginning of the experiment, participants (N=1001) were asked to \"Imagine you just bought a TV for $600. The TV is by LG, and has a 50\" screen and Ultra HD technology.\"18 They were then randomly assigned to one of three treatments. In the rst treatment, denoted Treatment WTP-First, participants were asked to complete the following sentence: \"The maximum amount in dollars that I am willing to pay for a protection plan that will cover all the repair costs of this TV in the next three years is \". They were then asked: \"In your opinion, what is the likelihood in percentages (%) that this TV will need a repair in the next three years?\". 17The experiment was conducted in mid-October 2017. 18LG is one of the brands with a 5% failure rate according to Consumer Reports . We selected the TV attributes and price based on online oerings at BestBuy and Costco at the time of the experiment. 23 We incentivized the second question by promising participants 10 additional cents if their re- sponse was among the 10 most accurate responses. In the second treatment, denoted Treatment Likelihood-First, the order of the questions was reversed. In the third treatment, denoted Treatment Information-First, participants were rst informed that \"You are told by an expert friend that the likelihood the TV will need a repair within the next three years is 5%.\" They were then asked to report the maximum amount they would be willing to pay for a three-year protection plan, as in the other treatments. After completing one of the three sets of questions above, participants were asked several ques- tions about the TVs they bought in the past few years. They then reported their age bracket, income bracket and gender. First nding: Failure probabilities are overestimated. The mean perceived failure prob- abilities in treatments WTP-First and Likelihood-First are 13.49% (standard error of 0.81) and 15.12% (standard error of 0.86) respectively. The median perceived probability in both treatments is 10%. These numbers are much higher than the objective three-year failure rate reported above. Thus, uninformed participants overestimated the failure probabilities. Moreover, the magnitude of the overestimation as reflected in the mean perceived probability is similar to that of the empirical analysis, in which a 5% failure probability is perceived as 11.9% in the parametric specication and 13.5% in the non-parametric specication. Figure 8 provides a ner description of the perceived probabilities by means of Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs). For each treatment, the CDF assigns for every 0 x 100 the proportion of participants in the treatment who estimated the failure probability to be weakly less than x%. The CDFs are similar (the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test statistic for the equality of the CDFs is 0.086 (p = 0.151)). In each of them, more than 60% of the participants reported probabilities that were at least two-fold larger than the objective probability. To examine the robustness of the reported probabilities to changes in incentives, we re-ran the two treatments with a smaller group of 209 participants. We promised participants a bonus of 20 cents, which is twice as large as the original incentive, if their estimate was among the 10 most accurate ones. We nd no signicant dierence in the reported probabilities relative to a bonus of 10 cents. The mean reported probability is 14.28 (standard error of 1.39) in Treatment WTP-First and 16.36 (standard error of 1.78) in Treatment Likelihood-First. The two CDFs of Treatment WTP- First with 10-cent and 20-cent incentives are similar (p =0.36), as are the two CDFs of Treatment Likelihood-First (p =0.50). Thus, the reported probabilities are robust to this change in incentives. 24 Table 11: WTP with and without information Treatment WTP-First (N = 334) Likelihood-First (N = 330) Information-First 337) 25 Note: Standard errors in parenthesis. Second row mean is truncated to eliminate the top one percentile of the WTP distribution. Second nding: WTP drops when information is provided. Table 11 summarizes partici- pants' reported WTP for a three-year warranty across treatments. The mean and the median WTP in Treatment Information-First are signicantly smaller than in Treatment WTP-First, indicating that providing participants with information about the objective failure rate reduced their WTP signicantly. Stronger evidence for this assertion is given in Figure 9, which draws the CDFs of the WTP distributions by treatment. The CDF for Treatment Information-First essentially rst- order-stochastically dominated by the CDF for Treatment WTP-First, indicating that WTP for warranties was reduced with information (the KS statistic for the equality of the CDFs is 0.309 (p < 0.001)). Two forces are potential drivers of the reduction in WTP. First, Treatment Information-First reminded participants about failure probabilities prior to reporting WTP. Merely reminding partic- ipants about failure probabilities (independently of whether the objective probability was specied or not) prior to reporting WTP could have driven the reduction in WTP. Second, Treatment Information-First informed participants about the objective failure probability. It is possible that informing participants about this low probability is what drove the reduction in WTP. To exam- ine the relevance of these two forces, we compare the WTP in Treatment Likelihood-First with the WTP in treatments WTP-First and Information-First because the rst force (i.e. reminder about probabilities) but not the second force ( i.e. information provision) was present in Treatment Likelihood-First. The data provides strong evidence for the presence of the second force. The CDF for Treatment Information-First in Figure 9 is essentially rst-order stochastically dominated by the CDF for Treatment Likelihood-First (the KS statistic is 0.238 (p < 0.001)). The mean and median WTPs are also signicantly dierent. There is also suggestive evidence for the presence of the rst force. The mean WTP in Treatment Likelihood-First is signicantly lower than in Treatment WTP-First (p =0.0018). The CDF for Treatment Likelihood-First in Figure 9 also appears to be rst-order stochastically dominated by the CDF for Treatment WTP-First, however, this is not statistically signicant (the KS statistic is 0.087 (p =0.14)). A possible explanation of the substantial dierence in the mean WTP but not in the WTP distribution, which is also supported by examining the truncated mean WTP in Table 11, is that reminding participants about probabilities has a larger eect on participants with higher WTP. 25 6.3 Experiment 2 This experiment elicits the WTP of informed participants for warranties for dierent TVs with the same failure rate, and uses the empirical strategy of Section 4 to estimate participants' proba- bility distortion and standard risk aversion post information provision. The estimated probability distortion of informed participants can then be interpreted as reflecting probability overweighting, and the gap between the estimated distortion and the perceived failure probabilities of uninformed participants in Experiment 1 as reflecting probability overestimation. We expected the experiment would take up to three minutes to complete, and promised a payment of 40 cents for participation. Participants (N = 916) were randomly assigned to one of two treatments. In the rst treatment, denoted Treatment 600-TV, participants were asked to \"Imagine you just bought a TV for $600. The TV is by LG, and has a 50\" screen and Ultra HD technology.\" That is, the specication of the TV was identical to the one in Experiment 1. In the second treatment, denoted Treatment 1000-TV, participants were rst asked to \"Imagine you just bought a TV for $1000. The TV is by LG, and has a 70\" screen and Ultra HD technology.\" That is, the TV price was higher than in Treatment 600-TV, and to make sure the $1000 price was realistic, the screen size was also larger. As in Treatment Information-First in Experiment 1, participants in both treatments were then informed about the 5% objective failure rate, and were asked to report the maximum amount they would be willing to pay for a three-year protection plan. After answering the rst question, participants were asked whether they had bought a TV in the past three years, and reported their age bracket, income bracket, and gender. Preliminary nding: WTP changes signicantly with price. Participants' WTP for war- is much higher for $1000 TVs than for $600 TVs. The mean WTP is 66.22 (standard error of 3.96) in Treatment 1000-TV relative to 46.89 (standard error of 3.43) in Treatment 600-TV, and the median WTP is 50 relative to 25. Figure 10 illustrates this ranking extends to the CDFs as the CDF for $1000 TVs rst-order stochastically dominates the CDF for $600 TVs (the KS statistic for the equality of the CDFs is 0.199 (p < 0.001)). Main nding: Probability distortions are signicantly reduced when information is provided. After truncating the top one percentile of the WTP distribution, we use the empirical strategy of Section 4 to estimate the degree of probability distortion and standard risk aversion among participants under two scenarios. In the rst scenario, we assume participants share the same distortion w and the same risk- aversion parameter r, but may dier from one another in various unobserved factors. As a result, participants' reported WTP does not equate the utility dierence to 0 precisely. Rather, it equates to an error parameter \u000f, which is equal to 0 in expectation. We estimate this model 26 using nonlinear least squares to nd r and w. The estimated value of w is 6.3%, which implies a 1.3% distortion of the objective probability. This distortion is about one-seventh of the 8.9% distortion expressed by uninformed participants in Experiment 1.19 The estimate of the risk-aversion parameter is negligible. In the second scenario, we divide participants into quartiles based on their WTP. We match the corresponding quartiles across treatments, and assume participants in each combined quartile share the same w and r. We repeat the above estimation procedure for each quartile separately. We nd that neither risk aversion nor probability distortions is required to explain WTP of the lower half of the WTP distribution. The estimated value of w for the 50-75 quartile is 7.1%, which implies a 2.1% distortion. This distortion is much smaller than the upward distortion of about 9.5% among the 50-75 quartile in Experiment 1. The 75-100 quartile has an upward distortion of 8.0%, which is again much smaller than the 28.4% distortion for the corresponding quartile in Experiment 1. Thus, providing information to participants reduces probability distortions signicantly. Be- cause the distortion post information provision provides an upper bound on the degree of probabil- ity overweighting, we conclude that the role of overweighting in driving participants' WTP is not signicant once they become informed about the objective failure probability. 6.4 Discussion The experimental results indicate that providing information about objective failure probabilities reduces WTP signicantly. A primary driver of the reduction in WTP is that information provi- sion reduces overestimation. Indeed, the estimated failure probability of informed participants in Experiment 2 is (1) much smaller than the average perceived failure probability in Experiment 1, and (2) similar to the objective failure probability elicited in the pretest. This latter observation also indicates the insignicant role of probability overweighting post information provision. There is also suggestive evidence that merely prompting participants to think about failure probabilities prior to reporting WTP reduces their WTP. One possible explanation for the reduction in WTP is that prompting participants to think about relevant aspects of the value of the warranty enhances their decision making. Another possible explanation, following the Bordalo et al.'s (2015) theory of attention, is that people are surprised when the unlikely event of TV failure is rst mentioned to them and overreact to this information when reporting WTP (Treatment WTP-First). As the surprise element is reduced, participants report lower WTP (Treatment Likelihood-First).20 Testing these and other possible explanations for why promoting participants to think about failure 19We truncate the top one percentile of the WTP distribution in Experiment 1 for the purpose of this comparison. 20The surprise element may also explain why the magnitude of the probability distortion in Experiment 2 is small relative to what is documented in the experimental literature (see e.g. Fehr-Duda and Epper (2012) for a survey.) Participants may be surprised when they realize \u2014 following information provision in Experiment 2 \u2014 that the objective failure probability is much smaller than they initially thought, and respond to this surprise by reporting a more conservative WTP. 27 7 probabilities reduces their WTP is a task for future research. The Eect of Probability Distortions on Economic Outcomes This section uses counterfactual analysis to quantify the eect of probability distortions relative to market power on economic outcomes. We consider four scenarios in the analysis. The rst scenario, \"Market power with Biased consumers\"(scenario MB), corresponds to the existing market in which the retailer has monopolist market power and buyers distort failure probabilities. In the second scenario, \"Market power with Unbiased consumers\" (scenario MU), the retailer continues to benet from the same market power but buyers do not distort failure probabilities. Comparing the second scenario with the rst enables us to study the importance of probability distortions while xing the existing market environment. In the third scenario, \"Competitive market with Unbiased consumers\" (scenario CU), unbiased consumers purchase warranties in a competitive market. Because of competition, market prices are equal to the retailers' marginal cost and retailers make zero prot. Comparing this scenario with the second scenario enables us to study the importance of market power in the absence of probability distortions. In the fourth scenario, \"Competitive market with Biased consumers\" (scenario CB), retailers price at marginal cost and buyers distort failure probabilities. Comparing this scenario with scenario CU enables us to study the importance of probability distortions in a counterfactual competitive environment. We assume that any change in the main product's price across the four scenarios is negligible. To motivate this assumption, we rst observe that little dierentiation exists between electronics retailers, and that TV prices are easily observable. Thus, in the absence of extended warranties and other add-ons, TVs would have been priced close to marginal cost. The introduction of extended warranties implies retailers may have incentives to cut TV prices below cost in order to increase the demand for warranties. There are several reasons to believe such price cutting, if it happens, is insignicant. First, on the theoretical side, Ellison's (2005) analysis indicates the incentive to cut prices below cost is mitigated by an \"adverse selection\" eect, i.e., cutting TV prices will attract a disproportionate volume of consumers with low WTP who will not buy warranties. Second, on the institutional side, TV manufacturers have tight controls on the pricing and marketing practices of retailers in order to prevent such price cutting. Two examples of controls are the Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) policy, whereby retailers cannot advertise below the manufacturer's suggested retail price, and the Unilateral Manufacturer's Retail Price (UMRP) policy, which imposes a penalty when retailers set prices below the UMRP. Third, on the empirical side, we hand collected and compared 40 TV prices from BestBuy and Target in 2003. BestBuy oered extended warranties in 2003, whereas Target did not. To the extent that Target and BestBuy face similar TV wholesale prices, we would expect TV prices at BestBuy to be lower than at Target if BestBuy's warranty business aected their 28 TV pricing. We nd, however, that TV prices are very similar across retailers. On average, TV prices at BestBuy are 0.4 percentage points higher than at Target (standard error of 0.9 percentage points), and the median price dierence is 0. In the four counterfactual scenarios, cost and demand for warranties depend on the TV price p and the failure rate . We use the average TV price of $400 and consider the failure rates {0.04, 0.05, ..., 0.15}. For the cost specication, we use the parametric estimate of c(pj , ) with pj = 400. To construct demand in scenarios MB and CB, we use the estimated and r from the parametric estimation. In the two other scenarios, we turn o the distortion by setting ()= but keep the same r. 7.1 Prices, volume, and prot Given cost and demand, we calculate optimal prices, attachment rates, and prot margins in the dierent scenarios. To derive a yearly dollar equivalent measure of prot, we assume 30 million people buy TVs every year.21 Panel A in Figure 11 plots the warranty-to-TV price ratio as a function of failure probabilities for the dierent scenarios. The price ratios are increasing and concave in the failure probability. They are highest in scenario MB, lower in scenario MU, and lowest in scenarios CU and CB. The gap between scenarios MB and MU is smaller than the gap between scenario MU and the two competitive market scenarios CU and CB. Thus, probability distortions lead to a price increase, but this price increase is smaller than the price increase due to market power. For example, at the average failure rate of 7%, the price ratio in scenario MB is about 20% higher than in scenarios CU and CB. About three quarters of this gap is attributed to market power (the gap between MU and the competitive-market scenarios), and the rest to probability distortions. Because prices in the competitive-market scenarios are equal to marginal cost (which includes payments to third-party providers), the same conclusion applies to prot margins: pricing power is responsible for three quarters of retailers' margin. Panel B in Figure 11 plots attachment rates as a function of failure probabilities. Attachment rates in scenario MB are 30% or larger, whereas attachment rates in scenario MU are around 5%. That is, xing the existing competitive environment with market power, the introduction of probability distortions leads to a ve-fold or larger increase in volume.22 Attachment rates in scenario MB are about three times larger than in scenario CU. That is, any rationing that takes place due to market power is insignicant relative to the volume increase due to the distortion. Panel C in Figure 11 plots prots as a function of failure rates. More than 90% of retailers' prot is due to probability distortions. 21This number is somewhat smaller than the yearly TV shipments in the US between 2010 to 2013, which ranged from 37 million to 40 million. (CNN, \"With new TVs, size matters,\" June 26, 2013). 22The comparison between scenarios CU and CB also highlights the large eect of the distortion on volume while xing the competitive environment, as volume more than doubles when moving from scenario CU to scenario CB. 29 To sum up, probability distortions drive the strong demand for warranties and the high prots, whereas market power drives the high prices and margins. 7.2 Consumer and total welfare Evaluating consumer welfare requires taking a stance as to whether probability distortions are welfare-relevant in the sense that the distorted probabilities should be part of consumer welfare. We interpret the results of the experiment, especially those of Experiment 2, as suggesting they should not, because the results demonstrate that providing information to consumers about objective failure probabilities triggers most of them to use the objective or slightly distorted probabilities in their decision making. Put dierently, information provision \"reveals\" that consumers prefer to use the objective probabilities in decision making. We thus evaluate welfare with respect to the objective failure probabilities. Figure 12 plots consumer welfare as a function of failure rates. Consumer welfare is highest in scenario CU. This is because consumers evaluate failure probabilities correctly and prices are lowest. Consumer welfare is lower in scenario MU. This is because prices are higher due to retailers' market power leading to lower attachment rates. In both scenarios, consumer welfare is positive because only consumers with true WTP above price buy warranties. Consumer welfare is negative in scenario MB, which is identical to the existing market. Put dierently, consumer welfare would increase if the market for extended warranties did not exist. This is because probability distortions are suciently large, so that any positive surplus generated by purchases of buyers with true WTP above price is dominated by the decrease in consumer welfare due to purchases of buyers with true WTP below price. Consumer welfare is even lower in scenario CB. This is because the increase in consumer welfare (relative to scenario MB) due to existing consumers paying lower prices and the entry of new consumers with true WTP above price is dominated by the decrease in consumer welfare due to the entry of new consumers with true WTP below price buying warranties because of the distortion. Figure 12 illustrates that the reduction in consumer welfare due to probability distortions in the existing competitive environment, i.e., the gap between MU and MB, and in the alternative competitive environment, i.e., the gap between CU and CB, are much larger than the reduction in consumer welfare due to market power (the gap between CU and MU or the gap between CB and MB). For example, at a 7% failure probability, consumer welfare increases by $140 million when moving from MB to CU, and more than 95% of this increase is due to shutting down the distortion, i.e., due to the transition from MB to MU. To illustrate the forces at play, consider the two positive welfare eects when moving from scenario MB to scenario MU (see Figure 13 for a graphical illustration). First, holding the warranty price xed, a shift inward of the demand curve occurs when shutting down probability distortions. Consumers who now forgo buying the warranty are exactly those who overpaid for warranties based on their true WTP for it, thus increasing consumer welfare. We refer to this eect as the ripo 30 8 eect. Second, warranty prices go down when shutting down the distortion. Existing buyers pay lower prices, and new consumers, who estimate failure probabilities correctly, buy warranties. As a result, attachment rates and consumer welfare increase. We refer to this eect as the price eect. Figure 14 plots the dollar-equivalent value of the two eects for various failure rates. The ripo eect clearly dominates the price eect for all failure rates. The eect of probability distortions on total welfare is ex-ante ambiguous. The rst-best level of insurance is the one in scenario CU, because all consumers with true WTP above cost are insured. In scenario MU, there is under-insurance relative to the rst-best, because retailers price warranties above cost, and thus consumers with true WTP above cost but below market prices are not insured. In scenarios MB and CB, there is over-insurance relative to the rst-best, because consumers with true WTP below cost purchase insurance due to probability distortions. See Figure 15 for a graphical illustration. Figure 16 plots total welfare as a function of failure rates. Total welfare in scenario MU is larger than in scenario MB. Put dierently, the adverse welfare eect of market power (the gap between CU and MU) is smaller than the adverse welfare eect of the distortion (the gap between MU and MB). The adverse welfare eect of the distortion is so large that total welfare in scenario CB is lower than in all other scenarios. Conclusion This paper analyzed the eect of probability distortions on economic outcomes in the extended warranty market. We established that the distortion is a dominant factor in driving the strong de- mand and high prot in this market. We also established that when consumers receive information about failure probabilities, their willingness to pay for warranties reflects a much smaller distortion, indicating the distortion is a mistake in decision making due to lack of information. We conclude with a short discussion of the policy implications of these ndings. In its 2003 report, the UK Competition Commission (2003) proposed that electronics retailers \"display the price of an applicable EW (extended warranty) alongside the DEG (domestic electrical good) in store and in press advertisement and other publicity.\" This proposal is an example of a competition policy that aims to intensify competition and lead to lower prices. But lower prices do not necessarily increase consumer welfare, because lower prices imply additional consumers with willingness to pay below price buy warranties due to overestimation. Our ndings suggest con- sumer policies that aim to improve consumers' decision making may be more eective in increasing consumer welfare. An example of such policy, which may have an eect similar to the information- provision treatments in our experiments, is to demand that retailers display the failure probability of the product next to its price. To illustrate this point, we return to our counterfactual scenarios. We can think about scenario MB as corresponding to the existing market, scenario CB as corresponding to the market outcome 31 following a competition policy that eliminates market power, and scenario MU as corresponding to the market outcome following a consumer policy that eliminates overestimation. Panel B in Figure 11 illustrates market volume will more than double if warranties are priced at cost as we move from MB to CB. However, Figure 12 illustrates consumer welfare will decrease. Total welfare will also decrease, because rms make zero prot in this scenario. On the other hand, both consumer welfare and total welfare are positive in scenario MU. Figure 17 provides additional evidence that consumer policies that lead to a reduction \u2014 and not necessarily the elimination \u2014 of the distortion are welfare-superior to competition policies that lead to price reduction. In the gure, we assume TVs are priced at $400, and the failure probability is 7%. In solid blue, we plot for every 0 1 how consumer welfare (Panel A) and total welfare (Panel B) change when consumers distort failure probabilities and warranty prices are a convex combination of competitive prices with weight and monopoly prices with weight 1 . As increases, i.e., as the market becomes more competitive, both consumer and total welfare decrease. In dashed red, we plot how welfare changes when consumers perceive failure probabilities as a convex combination of the objective probability with weight and the distorted probability with weight 1, and the retailer prices optimally with respect to the resulting demand. Clearly, welfare increases in , and for any , welfare is larger than following any price reduction. Thus, policies that aim to intensify price competition may lead to suboptimal results in markets with uninformed or biased consumers relative to consumer policies that aim to improve consumers' decision making.
