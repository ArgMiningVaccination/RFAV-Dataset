Aside from turning the hassle of making your morning Earl Gray and/or coffee into a somewhat enjoyable experience, our top favorite non-toxic tea kettle options below also come with an added benefit: The complete absence of toxic chemicals! Much like cookware, tea kettles are chock full of toxic substances like PFOA, PTFE, PFAs, Lead, and Cadmium. When these kettles exceed temperatures at which the coating breaks down, they emit toxins into our brews. In fact, research showed most teapots have a high level of toxic metals - including lead.

What tea kettles should I avoid? Here's the ugly truth: Many tea kettles don't pass the safety check. Aluminum, copper, and cast iron are known for leaching heavy metals at certain temperatures. You should also avoid plastic. Ultimately, anything that contains PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) or PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) can pose a danger to your health as they release [ various gases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28913736/) and toxic chemicals that present mild to severe toxicity. Are plastic tea kettles safe? To be frank, no. Plastic kettles leach endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) &/or Phthalates that can seriously affect your health. BPA is linked to issues like infertility, diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure, and if that wasn't enough, plastic is also extremely bad for the environment. Over 180 species of animals have been found with ingested plastics. Scientists reported that by 2050 the amount of plastic waste in landfills will reach over 9 billion metric tons! So why not opt for a plastic-free electric kettle or one of the safest non-toxic tea kettles for the gas stove instead? What is the safest tea kettle to use? The safest tea kettles are the ones made from stainless steel or Borosilicate glass. However, not all stainless steel kettle options are equal.
