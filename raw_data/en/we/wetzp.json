Full Text of the Announcement](#_Part_2._Full) [Section I. Funding Opportunity Description](#_Section_I._Funding) [Section II. Award Information](#_Section_II._Award_1) Eligibility Information](#_Section_III._Eligibility) [Section and Submission Information](#_Section_IV._Application_1) [Section V. Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages applications for innovative strategies to study the innate and adaptive immune responses induced by mycobacterial infection and/or Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine (BCG) or candidate anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) vaccines in HIV-infected or uninfected individuals. NIAID is particularly interested in studies that will provide new insights into the immune mechanisms required for protection from Mtb infection/re-infection or progression to active disease in latently infected individuals. Applications are sought that propose: 1) characterization of the timing, anatomical location, and contribution to disease outcome of systemic and mucosal immune responses to mycobacterial infection and/or vaccination; 2) development of new technologies and assays to compare key mycobacterial-specific mucosal and systemic immunological parameters and facilitate more sophisticated and comprehensive monitoring of human immune responses during vaccine clinical trials; and/or 3) monitoring of immune responses in appropriate animal models during preclinical studies and vaccine candidate selection. The outcomes of these research projects are expected to provide novel data advancing new hypotheses that can contribute to the advancement of new tuberculosis (TB) vaccines. Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a slow growing pathogen that infects a variety of host cells, including macrophages and epithelial cells. While it is estimated that TB rates are slowly decreasing globally, TB continues to have a major negative impact on public health systems as well as on infected individuals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2013, 9 million individuals developed TB disease and 1.5 million died. In addition, TB has been intricately associated with HIV infection, and since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic remains responsible for one fourth of all HIV-related deaths, making it the major killer of HIV-positive individuals. The rise in multi-drug resistant TB (estimated 480,000 people in 2013) also poses a major challenge to TB treatment and underscores the need for development of effective vaccines to prevent Mtb infection and/or TB disease. NIAID supports both a comprehensive research portfolio in immunology, and vaccine R&D in order to facilitate development of TB vaccines. Some of this work is achieved through the development and application of animal models, reagents, and assays to better assess Mtb pathogenesis, and through translational work performed in clinical trials of Mtb-uninfected, latently infected and HIV-infected individuals. Collaborative funding between NIAID and other agencies/partners has supported academia, product development partnerships and pharmaceutical companies and has contributed, at various stages in development, to about half of the candidate vaccines that are currently in clinical development ( [http://www.newtbvaccines.org/vaccine-candidates/](http://www.newtbvaccines.org/vaccine-candidates/)), as well as candidates that are studied preclinically. Vaccine development is also supported through basic and applied science to better understand host responses in infection and disease and in individuals who are able to contain Mtb naturally. Clinical study of candidates has led to identification of knowledge gaps in how we measure immunity, what animal models may be predictive of human responses and our understanding of vaccine and adjuvant design. No TB vaccine candidate has provided broad or reliable protection from infection, disease, or reoccurrence, and the currently used neonatal BCG vaccine does not provide notable protection against adult pulmonary TB. Consequently, immune correlates of vaccine-induced protection have not been identified, which would greatly accelerate selection of next generation vaccine candidates. In addition, Mtb infection does not induce lifelong protective immunity and individuals can develop disease multiple times. Although numerous studies have identified immunodominant Mtb antigens that trigger T cell responses and immune parameters that may be associated with some level of protection such as 1) production of TNF, IL-1, IL-6, GM-CSF and IFN-?, 2) generation of lung-resident poly-functional CD4 T cells, or 3) activation of innate T cells, none of these parameters appears to be sufficient to provide long-term protective immunity against Mtb infection or prevent the development of TB. Mtb also has evolved numerous immune evasion mechanisms that disrupt the generation of protective immunity and facilitate pathogen survival within the host. Finally, specific mechanisms in HIV-infected individuals that increase the probability of progression to active TB disease remain unclear, as do those that support growth of the pathogen in this population. This FOA seeks to stimulate innovative research in deciphering immune mechanisms in humans required for protection from Mtb infection or TB disease, or induced by TB vaccines that go beyond what have traditionally been investigated in TB. Animal models also provide valuable insights into these processes, as they permit studies of potentially important immune mechanisms that may not be possible to study in humans. In addition, animal efficacy data from TB vaccine candidates that are advancing to phase I clinical trials may provide valuable data on immune correlates of protection. Therefore, results from both human and animal studies have potential to provide new insights into mechanisms of protective immunity against Mtb and TB disease and help identify immunologic and pathogen-specific mechanisms that may be effectively targeted by vaccines in HIV-infected or uninfected individuals. The goal of this announcement is to encourage innovative studies to identify and understand the immunological responses that mediate protection from Mtb infection or progression to active TB disease. Such responses may be operative in mycobacterial infection, or following vaccination with BCG or investigational vaccines, and may have distinct relevance to HIV infected or uninfected individuals. Studies with human cells and tissues are encouraged, but research using well-justified animal models is also acceptable. Research approaches of interest, which go beyond descriptive information currently known about Mtb infection and responses to vaccines, include, but are not limited to: Applications proposing any of the following research topics will NOT be supported under this FOA: Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.

Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the [NIH mission](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. For this particular announcement, note the following: This R21 FOA is intended to encourage exploratory and developmental research projects of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on improving evaluation and monitoring of immune responses to TB vaccine candidates or mycobacterial infection or provide novel insights to further guide TB vaccine candidate development. An R21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. Accordingly, reviewers should focus their evaluation on the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. Appropriate justification for the proposed work, such as test-of-concept data, can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. Preliminary data are not required for R21 applications; however, they may be included if available. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following five points: 1) proposed use of the animals, and species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers to be used; 2) justifications for the use of animals and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers proposed; 3) adequacy of veterinary care; 4) procedures for limiting discomfort, distress, pain and injury to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound research including the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs and/or comfortable restraining devices; and 5) methods of euthanasia and reason for selection if not consistent with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. For Resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project. Not Applicable Not Applicable As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score. Reviewers will assess whether the project presents special opportunities for furthering research programs through the use of unusual talent, resources, populations, or environmental conditions that exist in other countries and either are not readily available in the United States or augment existing U.S. resources. Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: 1) [Data Sharing Plan](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); 2) [Sharing Model Organisms](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and 3) [Genomic Data Sharing Plan](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153). Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s) convened by the Center for Scientific Review (CSR) in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](#_1._Criteria).
