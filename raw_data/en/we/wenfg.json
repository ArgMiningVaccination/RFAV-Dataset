Bielefeld: Transcript Verlag. In 2012, the Swiss people voted in favor of a popular petition to integrate anthroposophic 2 medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, neural therapy, and herbal medicine into the official list of services covered by obligatory health insurance. As a consequence, all expenses for these types of treatment will henceforth be covered, if they are provided or prescribed by trained physicians. This indicates a growing social acceptance of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) 3 in Switzerland as part of the established health-care system. 4 -----1 All the empirical data on anthroposophical end-of-life care used in this article come from a case study conducted by Barbara Zeugin within the broader context of a research project on Alternative Religiosity and its Consequences at the End of Life funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (cp. www.nfp67.ch/ en/projects/module-4-cultural-concepts-social-ideals/project-lueddeckens, July 4, 2018).

Patient Education and Counseling 2012 Global advances in health and medicine : improving healthcare outcomes worldwide 2014 Anthroposophic medicine is a physician-provided complementary therapy system that was founded by Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman. Anthroposophic therapy includes special medicinal products, artistic therapies, eurythmy movement exercises, and special physical therapies. The Anthroposophic Medicine Outcomes Study (AMOS) was a prospective observational multicenter study of 1631 outpatients starting anthroposophic therapy for anxiety disorders, asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, low back pain, migraine, and other chronic indications under routine conditions in Germany. AMOS INCORPORATED TWO FEATURES PROPOSED FOR THE EVALUATION OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPY SYSTEMS: (1) a sequential approach, starting with the whole therapy system (use, safety, outcomes, perceived benefit), addressing comparative effectiveness and proceeding to the major system components (physician counseling, anthroposophic medicinal products, art therapy, eurythmy therapy, rhythmical massage therapy... European journal of medical research Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences 2008 Journal of Asthma and Allergy 2009 Background:Anthroposophic treatment for asthma includes special artistic and physical therapies and special medications.Methods:We studied consecutive outpatients starting anthroposophic treatment for asthma under routine conditions in Germany. Main outcomes were average asthma severity (0-10, primary outcome); symptoms (1-4); and asthma-related quality of life at 12-month follow-up (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ] overall score, 1-7, for adults; KINDL Questionnaire for Measuring Health-Related Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents, asthma module, 0-100, for children) at 12-month follow-up.Results:Ninety patients (54 adults, 36 children) were included. Anthroposophic treatment modalities used were medications (88% of patients, n = 79/90); eurythmy therapy (22%); art therapy (10%); and rhythmical massage (1%). Median number of eurythmy/art/massage sessions was 12 (interquartile range 10-20), median therapy duration was 120 days (84-184). From baseline to 12-month follow-up, all outcomes improved significantly (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Average improvements were: average asthma severity 2.61 points (95% 14.74 improvements were maintained until last follow-up after 24 months.Conclusions:Patients with asthma under anthroposophic treatment had long-term improvements of symptoms and quality of life. Clinical Medicine: Psychiatry Background and Methods: Anthroposophic treatment for anxiety disorders includes special artistic and physical therapies and special medications. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 64 consecutive adult outpatients starting anthroposophic treatment for anxiety disorders under routine conditions. Main outcomes were Anxiety Severity (physician and patient ratings 0-10), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (0-100), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, German version (CES-D, 0-60), and SF-36 Mental Component Summary. Results: Mean age was 42.3 years. Most frequent diagnoses were generalized anxiety disorder (44% of patients, n = 28/64) and panic disorder (39%). Median disease duration was 4.5 years. The anthroposophic treatment modalities used were medications (56% of patients), eurythmy therapy (41%), art therapy (30%), and rhythmical massage therapy (3%). Median number of eurythmy/art/massage sessions was 12, median therapy duration was 120 days. From baseline to six-month... Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
