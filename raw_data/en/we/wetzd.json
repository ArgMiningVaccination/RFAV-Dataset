Spiritual Science and Medicine", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Taking account of modern medical knowledge and practice, and deeply versed in alchemical, Paracelsian, and naturopathic approaches, as well as homeopathy, aroma therapy, and other 'alternative' therapies, Steiner demonstrates, on the basis of his own researches, how a truly integrated whole-person medicine is possible \u2014 one that understands the human as a being of body, soul, and spirit; a microcosm in the macrocosm, a mirror of the earth and of the heavens. Steiner's enthusiasm and familiarity with his subject are in evidence everywhere in this volume. The wealth of insights and the range of topics are staggering \u2014 from the meaning of sickness, polarities in the human organism, and the relation of therapy and pathology, to the nature of plant, mineral and animal in relation to the human being. Specific organs (heart, lungs, bladder, kidney, liver, and nervous system) and specific diseases (including cancer, tuberculosis, diabetes, and meningitis) are brought into extraordinary new relationships and interconnections. The whole question of diagnosis, health, and treatment is repeatedly viewed from various points of view. These twenty lectures of Dr. Steiner's on Spiritual Science and Medicine were given at the request of a number of practicing Doctors in Medicine. Some thirty doctors and students attended. | |[Introduction](SpiSci_intro.html) | |[LECTURE I](19200321p01.html) |March 21st, 1920| | Changes in medical outlook in the course of human evolution \u2014 Illness and health \u2014 The Archaeus of Paracelsus \u2014 Stahl's theory of Vitalism \u2014 The appearance and significance of pathological anatomy since Morgagni \u2014 Humoral pathology \u2014 Cellular pathology \u2014 Morbid and natural significance of comparative anatomy \u2014 Knowledge of extra-terrestrial formative forces \u2014 Metamorphosis \u2014 Troxler's concept of disease.| | |[LECTURE II](19200322p01.html) |March 22nd, 1920| | Theories regarding the Heart \u2014 The Heart as organ of balance between above and below \u2014 Polarity of the human organism \u2014 Physiognomy of disease \u2014 Hysteria as expression for preponderance of metabolic processes \u2014 Neurasthenia for preponderance of sensory processes \u2014 Tuberculosis: disposition and infection \u2014 Significance of individual symptoms for its course and cure \u2014 Nature of Homeopathy.| | |[LECTURE III](19200323p01.html) |March 23rd, 1920| | Combination of pathology and therapy through diagnosis \u2014 The Threefold Man \u2014 Motor and sensory nerves \u2014 Suggestion and hypnosis \u2014 Relation of remedy to patient \u2014 Metamorphosis of growth in plant and man \u2014 Power of adaptation and regeneration \u2014 Formative forces and man's functions of soul and spirit Elements of a psychology based on reality \u2014 Ascending and descending evolution \u2014 Processes of blood-formation and milk-formation.| | |[LECTURE IV](19200324p01.html) |March 24th, 1920| | Connection of man with external nature \u2014 The Ritter Treatment \u2014 Working out of therapy on basis of pathology \u2014 External and intestinal flora \u2014 Carbon process \u2014 Oxygen process \u2014 Thoughts and process of ideation \u2014 Parallelism of structural development of intestines and brain.
