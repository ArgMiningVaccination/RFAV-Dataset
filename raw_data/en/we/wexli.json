Rocky Mountain Cancer Data Systems Indiana Cancer Registrars Association Commission on Cancer, American College of Surgeons North American Association of Central Cancer Registries Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 1 INTRODUCTION A. BACKGROUND In 1985, the General Assembly of the State of Indiana passed Public Law 174 -1985 establishing a cancer registry \"for the purpose of recording all cases of malignant disease that occur in Indiana residents and compiling necessa ry and appropriate information concerning those cases...in order to conduct epidemiologic surveys of cancer and to apply appropriate preventive and control measures.\"1 An advisory committee was established to assist the Department of Health in creating s uch a registry. The committee developed the standards for establishing and maintaining the State Cancer Registry. They also helped develop a Policy and Procedure Manual and implemented training throughout the state. Hospitals, physicians, dentists, and medical laboratories began reporting January 1, 1987. A 1988 amendment to the law allows the State Cancer Registry to release confidential information to another state's cancer registry if that state has entered into a reciprocal agreement with the Depart ment of Health. The reciprocal agreement must state that information that identifies a patient will not be released to any other entity without the written consent of the patient.2 In 1991, IC 16 -4-9-3 was amended to allow the state to enter into reciprocal agreements with other states in order to exchange data between cancer registries. In a 1993 amendment, several laws were recodified. No substantial changes were made other than some minor wording changes, such as changing \"State Board of Healt h\" to \"State Department of Health.\" The current law is IC 16 -38-2. This manual has been revised from the edition released in 1995 to reflect current laws and standards. B. PURPOSE The intent of this manual is to serve as a reference for hospitals repor ting cases of malignant disease to the State Cancer Registry. The procedures set out in the manual have been developed in accordance with IC -38-2 and 410 IAC 21 -1 (Appendix A). C. DEFINITIONS The terms must, shall, and is required are used throughout th e manual to indicate what is mandatory and the only acceptable method under the law and rule. Should is used to reflect commonly accepted practices, yet allows effective alternatives to be used. May is used to indicate an alternative that is acceptable, but not necessarily preferred. D. REFERENCE MATERIALS This Policy and Procedure Manual serves as a reference which is offered free of cha rge to reporting entities. For a complete list of required references and other resources, see Chapter 1. 1 IC 16 -4-9 (IC 16 -38-2 since 1993) 2 IC 16 -4-9-6 (IC -38-2-6 since 1993) 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 2 E. CONSULTATION Personnel of the State Cancer Registry are available by telephone and, in special circumstances, on site to provide consultation on all aspects of reporting. These include abstracting, organization and management, cancer registry software ed ucation, and updates on cancer data management at the both the state and national level. The Indiana Cancer Registrars Association has graciously offered to serve as a source for consultation, utilizing the expertise of experienced cancer registrars acros s the state. F. OUTPUT The rule for implementing statewide reporting mandates that the State provide each reporting facility a comprehensive annual report that outlines the trends of malignant disease in Indiana. Hospitals, physicians, dentists, medical laboratories, and other persons may request and be provided with individualized special reports as state resources permit. G. QUALITY CONTROL The State Cancer Registry monitors data quality through a variety of activities that are described in Chapter 7. The activities include careful monitoring of the number of cases submitted, visual review of abstracts for completeness and accuracy, and exte nsive electronic edits. Chapter 7 provides policies for clarification and modification of data. Continuing education and policy and procedure updates will focus on issues identified through quality control activities. In summary, the State Cancer Regist ry serves as the state's repository of cancer data and an important resource offering a wide spectrum of services to the hospitals, physicians, dentists, and medical laboratories reporting to the State. As a tax supported service to health care profession als and the public, feedback regarding improvements in State Cancer Registry policies and services is welcomed.

Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 6 CHAPTER 2: CASEFINDING & SETTING UP A REGISTRY A. OVERVIEW The accuracy of a statewide database is dependent on the timeliness and completeness of casefinding (the ident ification of reportable cancer cases) at the hospital level. A variety of casefinding methods must be used since no single method can encompass all the possible medical resources used by cancer patients. B. REPORTABLE LIST A reportable list identifies d iagnoses that will be included in the registry and those that are to be excluded. The hospital's administration, cancer committee, and physicians; American college of Surgeons' Cancer Program Manual; and the State Policy and Procedure Manual should be con sulted when developing the reportable list. Appendix B contains the State reportable list. All diagnoses on the list must be reported to the State Registry. The hospital cancer committee may decide to collect additional diagnoses not on the list, called \"Reportable -by-Agreement\" cases (e.g., squamous cell carcinomas of the skin ). These cases do not need to be reported to the State Registry. C. METHODS OF CASEFINDING Definition Casefinding is a systematic method of identifying all reportable cancer cas es. For a hospital, the cases include all patients diagnosed or treated in a hospital, both inpatient and outpatient, during the first course of therapy. Cases identified at autopsy must also be reported. Responsibility To assure consistency and completeness, casefinding should be the responsibility of one hospital department that has access to patients' medical records and the appropriate hospital reports and listings. For this reason, the function is most commonly performed in the medical recor d department. However, it may be performed elsewhere, such as pathology, radiation therapy, oncology, or nursing department, provided there is ready access to the necessary records and a central place for record keeping. The person responsible for casefi nding should have a knowledge of medical terminology, especially in the field of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Interdepartmental communication and cooperation are essential for complete casefinding. Sources of Casefinding The following are potential so urces of cancer patient identification. Other sources, not listed here, may be appropriate, depending on the administrative structure of the hospital. To ensure that all potential sources of case identification are addressed, facilities should use the he alth information data systems and/or billing systems to print lists of cancer -related diagnostic codes. Casefinding should not be limited to a review of pathology reports. As potential cases are identified, the patient's name and medical record number sh ould be recorded for retrieval of the entire medical record. 1. Pathology and Cytology Departments Pathology reports, including reports with negative findings Bone marrow biopsies Histology reports Cytology reports Hematology reports Autopsy reports Pathology logs Pathology appointment registers Chapter 2 Casef inding & Setting Up a Registry Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 7 Most newly diagnosed cancer patients have a biopsy or surgical procedure for which a pathology report is written identifying and classifying the excised specimen. All pathology reports, along with the clinical s ummary, should be read to identify cases. Cases in which only specimens were reviewed by the reporting hospital may never have a medical record. The coded final histologic diagnoses (in SNOMED) should be reviewed. Sometimes a programmer can prepare a li st containing only malignancies. A negative pathology or cytology report may be a hidden source for finding certain cases. If an excisional biopsy was performed in a physician's office and the patient was later referred to the hospital for additional tre atment, the pathology report may be negative if no further cancer was detected. The case should still be reported to the State Registry by the hospital because the patient was referred to the hospital for further diagnosis or treatment . Example #1: A physician diagnoses a melanoma and performs the excisional biopsy in the office. The patient is then admitted to the hospital for a wide excision. The pathology report does not show any malignancy. Although the pathology report is negative, the case sho uld be reported to the State Registry by the hospital because the patient was referred to the hospital for additional treatment. Example #2: A physician performs a lumpectomy for breast cancer in the office. The patient is later admitted to the hospital for a modified radical mastectomy. No residual tumor was noted on the pathology report. The hospital must report this case to the State Registry, even though the pathology report is negative. 2. Health Information Management Department (Medical Record D epartment) Inpatient records Outpatient records Disease or diagnostic index Computerized listings of specific cancer -related ICD -10-CM codes Operation index Admitting lists Discharge lists Health information management department personnel may assist in c ase identification in a number of ways. A regular listing of all cancer cases may be helpful in casefinding. Working with personnel responsible for assembly and analysis of records upon discharge may identify patients overlooked through other reviews. C oders could flag all medical records with malignant diagnoses for review by the Cancer Registrar. If feasible, direct review of all medical records by the cancer registrar assures more complete casefinding. Appendix C lists the ICD -10-CM codes that shoul d be reviewed for eligible cases. 3. Bill and Insurance Department (Patient Accounts) Print-outs listing cancer -related diagnostic codes Hospital and/or departmental billing systems use diagnostic codes for billing purposes. Computerized billing systems may be used to generate lists of cancer -related diagnostic codes. See Appendix C of this manual for a list of cancer -related codes. Cancer registrars should work with billing department personnel to assess the capabilities of the system and develop the parameters of the report. The process may involve the computer vendor. 4. Radiology Department Radiation therapy treatment summaries Radiation therapy new patient listings Radiation therapy log Radiation therapy schedule Radiation oncology records Casefinding & Setting Up a Registry Chapter 2 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 8 Nuclear medicine reports Nuclear medicine log Nuclear medicine schedule Diagnostic radiology reports Scans The radiation therapy department can be an important source of casefinding since many patients are treated solely as outpatients and may be missed b y other casefinding methods. Radiology records should be made available to the person responsible for casefinding, by either providing copies of the reports or permitting access to the radiation therapy department's patient records. A periodic review of the department's therapy log or schedule will serve as a quality control check and help ensure completeness of casefinding. 5. Outpatients/Clinics/ER Ambulatory/outpatient surgery records Day surgery logs Outpatient scheduling logs CPT codes on outpatient records Emergency room records/logs ENT (ear, nose, throat) clinic records Eye clinic records Skin (melanoma, others) clinic records Mycosis fungoides clinic records OB/GYN clinic records AIDS/Kaposi's sarcoma clinic records If outpatient records are not filed in the medical record department, arrangements should be made with the applicable departments and clinics for access to the patient records at a mutually convenient time. 6. Cancer Conference/Tumor Board The cancer committee of a hospital is responsible for conducting cancer conferences (tumor boards) to provide consultative services to patients and to educate the medical staff. Attendance at these conferences or review of minutes may identify additional cancer patients. 7. Other Sources of Casefinding Operation/surgery log Operation/surgery schedule Oncology/Hematology records Chemotherapy logs Staff physician's office Preventing Duplicates All cancer patients who have been identified by any of the methods described above should be checked against cases in the suspense system (Chapter 2, section D) and the patient index (Chapter 2, section F). If a patient's name is found in either of these places with the same primary cancer, the case has been identified previously and should not be added to the database. These patients may be readmissions for additional treatment, recurrence, progression of or persistent disease, or follow -up. The information obtained through casefinding should be preserved and used to help complete the abstract (if the case was found in the suspense system) or to complete follow -up (if the case was found in the patient index), if applicable. Chapter 2 Casef inding & Setting Up a Registry Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 9 D. SUSPENSE SYSTEM Definition A suspense system is a file or a list of cancer cases that have been identified but have not yet b een completely entered, abstracted, or accessioned into the registry. The file or list serves as a method for keeping track of identified cancer patients until the abstracts are complete. Purpose The suspense system has two functions: To avoid duplicate case identification, and; To serve as a quality control check to assure that over a period of time, all identified cases have been abstracted. Organization For convenience in duplicate checking, the suspense system should be arranged alphabetically by month of case identification. Patient data should include: Patient name Date of diagnosis Medical record number Cancer primary site A paper abstract with the above information could be used as the suspense system, or an index card could be completed. The abstracts or cards should be filed alphabetically. If the patient index described in Section F. is maintained on cards, these cards could be partially completed and used in a suspense file. Once the case is fully abstracted, the card in the suspense file could be moved to the alphabetic patient index and the rest of the information completed. A suspense system can also be set up in the Rocky Mountain Cancer Data System (RMCDS) program. As much information as is initially known about the patient is entered (e.g., name, medical record number, admission date, etc.). In the \"Suspense\" field, code 1 is entered to indicate the case is in suspense. Records with suspense code 1 are excluded when extensive edits are applied. When the full c ase is later abstracted, the suspense code 1 should be changed to zero (0) and the edits should be applied. A list can be printed at any time of all patients with suspense code 1 to ensure abstracting has been completed for all cases in the suspense file. E. ACCESSION REGISTER Definition The accession register is an annual, sequential listing of all reportable cases included in a hospital's cancer registry. It serves to identify, count, and evaluate the annual caseload. The register can be used to audi t other registry files, monitor casefinding, assess the workload, and verify patient identification. Description The following items should be included in the accession register: 1. Accession number The first four digits of the accession number should specify the year that the patient was first seen at the reporting hospital for the diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer following the registry's reference date. The last five digits are a number each case is assigned in sequential order, beginning with 00001 at the start of each new calendar year. Detailed instructions on accession numbers can be found in Chapter 5. Casefinding & Setting Up a Registry Chapter 2 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 10 2. Sequence number Sequence numbers indicate the chronological order of the diagnoses of independent, primary malignancies or reporta ble benign tumors that occur over the patient's lifetime. Detailed instructions on sequence numbers can be found in chapter 5. 3. Patient name 4. Primary site 5. Date initial diagnosis (or date first seen at the reporting institution) 6. Class of case (op tional; see item description in Chapter 5 for further information) A sample page follows, but the hospital should design the accession register according to its own needs. Accn. Year & Number Seq. Name Primary Site Date of Diagnosis Class 201200001 00 01 Brown, John Q. prostate 01/02/ 2012 1 201200002 00 Smith, Susan lung 01/15/ 2012 0 199700150 02 Jones, Mary (patient's first primary was in 1997) breast 02/07/ 2012 1 201200003 00 Green, George pancreas 03/24/ 2012 2 201200001 02 Brown, John Q. (patient's first primary was 200100001) kidney 04/08/ 2012 1 201200004 00 Washington, Martha colon 04/21/ 2012 0 An explanation of how the registry would assign the accession numbers in the 20 12 table above follows: 1. 201200001 -00 (for the patient's first primary malignancy) 2. 201200002 -00 3. 199700150 -02 (A patient whose first primary was entered in the registry in 1997 retains the original accession number and only the sequence number changes.) 4. 201200003 -00 5. 201200001 -02 (For the patient's second of two primaries in 20 12, the patient's original accession number remains the same, but the sequence number for his first primary must be changed from 00 to 01.) 6. 201200004 -00 The final (highest) accession number for a year will not nec essarily be the total number of new cases that year. Patients admitted with new primaries and who had accession numbers assigned in a previous year will be listed but using the original number and therefore will not be counted in the current year's sequen ce of accession numbers. F. PATIENT INDEX Definition The patient index is a complete alphabetical file or list of all patients, living or dead, identified and reported by the hospital since the reference date (starting date for reporting). Before a pati ent is added to the registry, the patient index should be checked to see if the patient has already been accessioned. Chapter 2 Casef inding & Setting Up a Registry Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 11 Description The following data items must be included in the patient index: Name Date of birth Sex Medical record number Accession numb er Date of death Sequence number (for each primary site) Date of diagnosis (for each primary site) Laterality (for each primary site) Site (for each primary site) Histology (for each primary site) Below is a sample patient index entry, but the hospital should design their file according to their own needs. Name: DOB: should be only ONE entry or card per patient in the patient index. All independent primaries in the same patient are included on the same entry or card. The index should be maintained in alphabetic order and be retained indefinitely. G. FILING Hospitals reporting by paper abstracts should keep the original abstract form and submit a copy of the abstract form to the State Cancer Registry (see Chapter 3). The most efficient filing system for hospitals reporting on paper abstracts is filing all cases in ascending numerical order by the first two digits of the primary site code. Example: All patients with cancer of the small intestine (C17._) are filed before all patients with cancer of the colon (C18._). Within each site, cases are separated by accession year. Within each accession year, cases are filed alphabetically. Casefinding & Setting Up a Registry Chapter 2 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 12 Example: All patients with colon cancer in 1994 will be filed alphabetically behind all patients with colon cancer in 1993. The file of abstracts in site order could serve as a primary site index, making records more easily retrievable for studies. The cancer registry database, original abstract s, any copies of them , and associated documentation must be regarded as confidential medical records and th eir storage should comply with applicable hospital and state regulations for confidentiality and security of records. Abstracts are retained indefinitely in electronic format or hard copy . Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 13 CHAPTER 3: REPORTING A. OVERVIEW This chapter explains the cases and types of diagnoses to be reported, who should submit abstracts, when abstracts should be submitted, and how they should be submitted. B. CASES TO REPORT TO THE STATE REGISTRY 1. General Requirements All confirmed cases of reportable tumors diagnosed and/or initially treated in Indiana must be reported to the State Cancer Registry, as specified in this section. Reportable diagnoses are listed in Appendix B. Confirmed cases include clinically diagnosed patients (not microscopically confirmed) as well as microscopically confirmed diagnoses. If a recognized medical practitioner documents that a patient has cancer, the diagnosis is reportable. Terms that constitute a clinical diagnosis can be found in Ch apter 4. Reportable cases include inpatients and outpatients (including hospital -affiliated ambulatory care settings). 2. Required Cases a. In situ and frank malignancies - those with an International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition , 2000 ( ICD-O-3.2) fifth digit behavior code of /2 or /3. These diagnoses appear on the Reportable List of Malignancies in Appendix B. Exceptions (Not Reportable): Preinvasive cervical neoplasia III) diagnosed 01/01/2003 or later; Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III 01/01/2003 or later; Basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of ( site -C44.9 with histology codes 8000 -8110) diagnosed 01/01/2003 or later. b. If diagnosed before 01 /01/2003, basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of skin ( site codes C44.0 -C44.9 with histology codes 8000 -8110) that meets at least one of the following conditions at the time of diagnosis : (1) Primary tumor more than 5 centimeters in greatest dimension; (2) Primary tumor that has invaded deep extradermal structures such as cartilage, skeletal muscle, or bone; (3) Primary tumor with regional node metastases; (4) Primary tumor with metastasis to distant sites. c. Basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma ( ICD-O-3.2 histology Indiana Registry d. Pilocytic/j uvenile astrocytoma, listed as 9421/1 in ICD-O-3.2, is required and should be reported as 9421/3. Exception (Reportable) : The behavior is non-malignant when the primary site is optic nerve (C723). e. The ICD-O-3.2 code for Carcinoid tumor, NOS, of appendix ( 8240/1) is obsolete in 2015. Carcinoid tumors of the appendix must be coded to 8240/3 and are required to be reported. f. All benign and borderline (behavior codes /0 and /1) intracranial and central nervous s ystem tumors diagnosed January 1, 2004 or later. ( ICD-O-3.2 primary site codes C70.0 -C72.9, C75.1 -C75.3.) g. Analytic cases (see Item 28 in Chapter 5 for further information on analytic and nonanalytic cases). Analytic cases include the following: (1) All new malignancies diagnosed at the reporting facility on or after January 1, 1987 (class of case 00). (2) All malignancies initially diagnosed and treated at the reporting facility for all or part of the first course of treatment on or after January 1, 1987 (class of case 10, 13, or 14). (3) All malignancies initially diagnosed in a staff physician's office on or after January 1, 1987 and treated at the reporting facility for all or part of the first course of treatment (class of case 11 or 12). (4) All malignancies initially treated at reporting facility for all or part of the first course of treatment on or after January 1, 1987 (class of case 20, 21, or 22). This includes patients who previously have been diagnosed with a cancer prior to January 1, 1987 and have a new primary malignancy diagnosed at the reporting facility on or after January 1, 1987. ( Only the new malignancy diagnosed on or after January 1, 1987 must be reported to the State Cancer Registry .) Do not report the malignancy diagnosed b efore January 1, 1987. h. Nonanalytic class of case 32 diagnosed on or after January 1, 1987. Class 32 includes cases first diagnosed elsewhere and all of the first course therapy elsewhere. The reporting facility diagnosed and/or treated the recurrence or progression of a malignancy diagnosed January 1, 1987 or later. i. Cases with diagnoses (for example, VIN III), required by the State, but not by CoC that are diagnosed and/or treated at the reporting facility on or after January 1, 1987 (Nonanalytic class of case 34 or 36). j. Nonanalytic class of case 35 or 37 diagnose d on or after January 1, 1987. Class 35 or 37 includes cases first diagnosed and/or first course of therapy at the reporting facility before the registry's reference date. Class of case 35 or 37 would be applicable only for a registry with a reference da te later than 1987. Example 1: Hospital A changed their reference date from 1987 to 1992. In 1993, a patient is admitted who was diagnosed and treated for a melanoma at Hospital A in 1990 and has returned for a recurrence. The case is class 35 for the hospital and should be reported to the State Registry in 1993 if not previously reported when diagnosed. Example 2: Hospital A changed their reference date from 1987 to 1992. In 1993, a patient is admitted with a second primary. The first primary, t reated at Hospital A in 1990, is class of case 37 for the hospital and should be reported to the State Registry in 1993 if not previously reported when diagnosed. Chapter 3 Reporting Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 15 k. Patients first diagnosed at autopsy (Nonanalytic class of case 38). l. Patients diagnose d and treated only in a staff physician's office (Nonanalytic class of case 40 or 41). Reportable by the hospital only if the hospital collects class 40 and 41 cases. Otherwise, reportable by the physician's office. m. The types of cases list below are reportable to the State Registry, though not reportable by CoC. Since documentation for these cases may be limited, report all information available either in your usual format, by paper abstract, or by sending copies of pertinent medical record documenta tion. (1) Pathology -only cases (Nonanalytic class of case 43). (2) Patients seen in consultation to confirm a diagnosis or first course treatment plan (Nonanalytic class of case 30). Example : A patient comes to the institution for a second opinion. Staff physicians order diagnostic tests and support the original treatment plan. The patient returns to the other institution for treatment. C. CASES NOT REQUIRED 1. Cases with an International Classification of Diseases of Oncology, Third Ed ition, 2000 ( ICD-O- 3.2) fifth digit behavior code of /0 (benign) or /1 (uncertain or borderline), which are the codes for precancerous conditions or benign tumors. Exceptions (Reportable): Pilocytic/ juvenile astrocytoma, listed as 9421/1 in ICD-O-3.2, is required and should be reported as 9421/3 unless the primary site is optic nerve (C723) . Report behavior as non -malignant for optic nerve pi locytic/juvenile astrocytoma diagnosed 2004 or later. All benign and borderline intracranial and central nervous system tumors diagnosed January 1, 2004 or later are reportable. ( ICD-O-3.2 primary site of appendix, listed as 8240/1 in ICD-O-3.2, is required effective 2015 and should be coded to 8240/3. Mature teratoma , listed as 9080/0 in ICD-O-3.2, of the testes in adults is malignant and reportable as 9080/3 . Mature teratoma in prepubescent children continues to be non - reportable (9080/0). 2. If diagnosed 01/01/2003 or later, all basal cell and squamou s cell carcinoma of skin ( ICD-O-3.2 primary site codes C44.0 -C44.9 If diagnosed before 01/01/2003, basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of skin that are in situ or that are invasive and 5 centimeters or less in greatest dimension with no lymph node or distant metastasis. 3. Analytic cases (class of case codes 00 -22) who were first diagnosed or first treated at the reporting facility on or after January 1, 1987 and return to the facility for: a. A recurrence of that same primary; b. Subsequent treatment; c. Progression of rec urrent disease (disease free period); or d. Continued or persistent disease (never disease free). Note: An abstract would have been submitted when the patient was first diagnosed or first treated. Once a case has been accessioned into a registry, it is not re-accessioned or reported if the patient returns to the hospital for that same primary. Reporting Chapter 3 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 16 4. Nonanalytic class of case 30 -33 diagnosed before January 1, 1987. Class 30 -33 includes cases first diagnosed elsewhere and all of the first course therapy els ewhere. If the reporting facility is treating the recurrence or progression of a malignancy diagnosed before January 1, 1987, the case should not be reported to the state. 5. Nonanalytic class of case 35 and 37 diagnosed before January 1, 1987. Class 35 and 37 includes cases diagnosed and/or first course of therapy at the reporting facility before the registry's reference date. Patients with the following situations would be non -reportable class of case 35 and 37: Patients first diagnosed before January 1, 1987 who: a. Received no treatment after being diagnosed; b. Received first course of treatment before January 1, 1987 ; c. Received first course of treatment before January 1, 1987 and subsequent treatment on or after January 1, 1987; d. Received first course of treatment before January 1, 1987 and had a recurrence of that same primary on or after January 1, 1987. 6. Patients who receive transient care to avoid interrupting a course of therapy started elsewhere (class of case 31). Please verify with the State Cancer Registry that such patients who are Indiana residents have been reported by the other facility. Example 1: A patient is visiting relatives in the area. The oncology department at the repo rting facility dispenses the scheduled chemotherapy. Example 2: Another institution sends a patient to the reporting facility because of equipment failure. The reporting facility administers the radiation therapy until the equipment is repaired. The pat ient returns to the original institution to complete therapy. 7. Patients with active cancer who are admitted for an unrelated medical condition. Please verify with the State Cancer Registry that such cases have been reported. Example: A patient with active prostate cancer enters the reporting facility's cardiac care unit for cardiac care only. 8. Patients with a history of cancer who currently have no evidence of the disease. Please verify with the State Cancer Registry that such case s have been reported. 9. Patients admitted to a designated hospice unit or home care service. Please verify with the State Cancer Registry that such cases have been reported . 10. Patients admitted for terminal supportive care only. Please verify with t he State Cancer Registry that such cases have been reported . 11. Class of case 49 (diagnosed by death certificate only). The State Cancer Registry will collect cancer data on these patients after all reasonable efforts to obtain information from a health care provider have failed. 12. Residents of a foreign country. 13. Annual follow -up on all cases (optional reporting). 14. Hospitals may abstract cases that are not required by the State Registry, but are important for their own clinical, administrativ e, management, or marketing purposes. These patients often receive services and use the resources of the hospital (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, lab tests, etc.). These cases should not be reported to the State Registry. Examples include non - reportable localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin and class 35 or 37 cases diagnosed before 1987 . Chapter 3 Reporting Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 17 D. DATA ITEMS TO REPORT 1. Analytic Cases Required and optional data items to report to the State Registry for analytic cases are identified in Chapter 5 of this manual. The items are listed in a table of the State data set in Chapter 5 and are presented in the pages following the table with desc riptions, codes, formats, definitions, rules, and instructions. 2. Reportable Nonanalytic Cases Since hospitals may have limited information about nonanalytic cases (reportable if diagnosed after January 1, 1987), a minimal data set for these cases is pre sented in the table below . Apply the codes, definitions, and rules in chapter 5 for these items and record them in either the paper or a computerized abstract. If the information for an item is not available, leave the item blank or code it according to the vendor's instructions for \"unknown.\" No. Item Notes 1. Reporting hospital ID number 2.

WHO SHOULD SUBMIT REPORTS The hospital that first diagnoses a case in 1987 or later is responsible for submitting an abstract to the State Cancer Registry. A hospital that performs part or all of the first course treatment for cases diag nosed in 1987 or later is responsible for submitting an abstract to the State Cancer Registry. A hospital that treats recurrence or progression of a malignancy first diagnosed elsewhere in 1987 or later and all of first course of treatment performed elsewhere is responsible for submitting an abstract to the State Cancer Registry. The staff physician's office is considered an extension of the hospital. Cases of patients who are diagnosed or treated in a staff physician's office and referred to the hospital for definitive therapy must be reported as though they were diagnosed at the hospital. If these patients were referred to another institution for their first course of treatment, then their cases need not be included. Patients diagnosed and treated only in a staff physician's office (class of case 40 or 41) are to be reported if such cases are collected by the hospital. If not reported by the hospital, these cases must be reported by the physicians' offices. When the distinction between a hospi tal-based department and a free standing facility cannot readily be made (e.g., a radiation therapy group practice versus a hospital unit) the ownership of the medical record should be used to determine whether a case must be reported by the hospital. The owner of the medical record is responsible for reporting the case to the State Cancer Registry. . F. WHEN TO SUBMIT REPORTS Facilities must complete and submit reports of confirmed cases of reportable tumors to the State Cancer Registry no later than six (6) months following the date the patient comes under the care of the reporting facility. Facilities should report on a schedule based on the size of their annual caseload. The minimum reporting requirements for each caseload range is prov ided in the table below. More frequent reporting is encouraged so that the State database remains as current as possible for analytic purposes. REPORTING SCHEDULE Average Number of Cases Diagnosed per Year Minimum Frequency for Reporting to the State 1-59 Biannually 60-149 Quarterly 150-299 Every other month Chapter 3 Reporting Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 19 300 Every month G. HOW TO SUBMIT REPORTS 1. Hospitals With Computerized Systems a. Hospitals with computerized registries should submit reports to the State Cancer Registry in an acceptable, machine -readable format (RMCDS format for hospitals using RMCDS software and NAACCR format for those using other systems) within the time frame described in this chapter. b. Make sure all cases abstracted since the previous submission are selected for each new submission. Selecting cases by a range of accession numbers will omit patients with an earlier accession number who have a new primary. Contact your software vendor for procedures to ensure all cases are reported to t he State Cancer Registry . c. Submitting by FTP Program The preferred method for submitting data is to use the ISCR FTP Program that encrypts your data file and sends it to the ISCR through the Internet using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). If your fac ility prohibits or limits the use of FTP, the program can also send the encrypted file as an e -mail attachment. The method meets government security requirements. Contact the State Cancer Registry to obtain procedures for submitting data by using the FTP Program. d. Submitting by Web Plus An alternate method is to use the Web Plus program that securely uploads your file through a browser. The method also meets government security requirements. Contact the State Cancer Registry to obtain procedures for submitting data by using Web Plus e. Submitting on Diskettes Effective July 2009 the State Cancer Registry can no longer process data submitted on diskettes . f. Ensure that the contents of computerized abstracts are treated with the same level of secur ity and confidentiality as the medical record. The abstracts are abbreviated medical records and should be treated as such. A full discussion of confidentiality is found in Chapter 8 of this manual . g. The hospital should keep a record of cases submitte d to the State. The State Cancer Registry personnel will keep track of the date, number of disks, and number of cases received from each hospital. 2. Hospital Using Paper Forms a. Hospitals should submit reports to the State within the time frame describ ed in this chapter, using the \"Hospital Abstract\" form designed and approved by the State Cancer Registry. Computerized registries may use the form to submit reportable nonanalytic cases that are not abstracted into their registry systems . Forms may be ob tained, free of charge, by calling or writing the State Cancer Registry. Katelyn Haywood Office: (317) 233 -7158 Indiana State Cancer -7722 Indiana Department of Health E-mail: khaywood @isdh.in.gov 2 North Meridian Street, Section 6-B Indianapolis, IN 46204 -3010 Reporting Chapter 3 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 20 b. Attach a copy of the pathology report to the abstract form. State Cancer Registry staff need the reports to substantiate the codes . c. When sending in more than one abstract for multiple tumors on a patient, do not staple abstracts on different tumors together, as they may be overlooked. Do staple copies of medical record documentation about the reported tumor to the applicable abstract. d. The hospital should make a legible copy of the original abstract and mail the copy to the State Cancer Registry, keeping the original at the hospital. Illegible abstracts will be returned to the hospital . e. Ensure that abstracts are treated with th e same level of security and confidentiality as the medical record. The abstracts are abbreviated medical records and should be treated as such. A full discussion of confidentiality is found in Chapter 8 of this manual . f. The hospital should keep a rec ord of abstracts mailed to the State Cancer Registry, noting the date and number submitted. The State Cancer Registry personnel will keep track of the number of abstracts and date received from each hospital. g. Envelopes containing copies of the abstrac ts should be carefully sealed and labeled \"CONFIDENTIAL MEDICAL INFORMATION.\" The envelope should be clearly addressed: Indiana State Cancer Registry Indiana Department of Health 2 North Meridian Street, Section 6-B Indianapolis, IN 46204 -3010 3. Other Forms a. Correction and Follow -Up Form Chapter 6 of this manual describes a \"Correction and Follow -Up Form\" and instructions for completing it. Corrections or annual follow -up data on previously submitted Hospital Abstracts may be reported on this form. b. Correction Form for Multiple Patients Chapter 6 also describes a \"Correction Form for Multiple Patients\" and i nstructions for completing it. These forms may be obtained by calling or writing the State Cancer Registry. Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 21 CHAPTER 4: GENERAL DEFINITIONS FOR CODING A. INTRODUCTION The State Cancer Registry uses definitions published by national standard -setting organizations in order to ensure that its instructions and the data collected are consistent with those from other registries. The standard -setting organizations include the American College of Surgeons, Commission on Cancer (ACoS/CoC); the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR); and the National Cancer Institute's SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) program. B. GUIDELINES FOR INTERPRETATION OF TERMINOLOGY The overall priority for using information to determine tumor involvement is pathological, operative, then clinical findings. The medical practitioner may use ambiguous terms when describing a clinical diagnosis or extent of disease in relat ion to tumor invasion of an organ or structure, especially when there is no cytologic or histologic proof of disease extension. When there are questions concerning terminology, consult with a physician or pathologist. The following lists should be used w hen the terminology is vague or ambiguous. Terms That Indicate Clinical Diagnosis or Tumor Involvement/Extension adherent to apparent apparently appears to comparable with compatible with consistent with contiguous/continuous with encroaching upon extension - to, into, onto, or out onto favor(s) features of fixation (to another structure) fixed (involvement of other organ/tissue) impending perforation of 2 impinging upon 2 impose, imposing on 2 incipient i nvasion induration (for breast cases) infringe, infringing 2 into intrude invasion - to, into, onto, or out onto malignant appearing matted (for lymph nodes only) most likely neoplasm (only for C70.0 -C72.9, C75.1 - C75.3 diagnosed 01/01/04 and later) obliterate onto out onto overstep 2 presumed probable probably protruding into (unless encapsulated) suspect suspected suspicious (for) 1 to tumor (only for C70.0 -C72.9, C75.1 -C75.3 diagnosed 01/01/04 and later) violate typical of up to Example: A chest x -ray is consistent with a carcinoma of the right upper lobe. Final diagnosis is probable carcinoma of the right lung. The case should be abstracted and reported. 1 Exception: If a cytology specimen is reported as \"suspicious,\" do not inte rpret this as a diagnosis of cancer unless it is confirmed by a positive biopsy or a physician's clinical assessment. 2 These terms are considered involvement by the SEER Program and non -involvement by the Statistical Analysis and Quality Control Center at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA. Consult the attending physician regarding these terms.

This case should not be abstracted and reported Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 27 CHAPTER 5: CODING INSTRUCTIONS OVERVIEW An abstract is a summary of pertinent information about the patient, the cancer, the treatment, and outcome. A paper abstract for reporting such information is available for facilities with non -computerized registries. An abstract is used to collect the following three categories of information: Patient and Hospital Identification This includes data items related primarily to demographic information about the patient and hospital - specific information. Cancer Identification This includes data items related primarily to information about the patient's tumor or cancer. Treatment Data This includes treatment data and follow -up information. Chapter 5 explains how to complete each item within the three categories. Rules and codes for recording the information are consistent with the Standards for Oncolog y Registry Entry (STORE ) to the extent possible and apply to both paper and computer abstracting unless they conflict with an alternative software vendor's instructions. As with the STORE , abstracters should use the rules and codes in this manual only for cases diagnosed January 1, 2021 and later unless instructed otherwise. Chapter 3, Section C. lists the types of cases to be reported on an abstract. WHEN TO ABSTRACT A CANCER CASE 1. Cancer case information should be abstracted after complete work -up, cancer staging, and planned first course of treatment have been initiated. The first course of treatment is generally initiated within four months after the cancer is initially diagnosed. With the exception of early deaths, cases should not be abstracted less than four months after diagnosis. 2. Cases are due at the State Cancer Registry no later than six months following the date the patient comes under the care of the reporting facility. 3. Follow -up items are required and should be completed at the t ime the rest of the case is abstracted. Subsequent, annual follow -up information is optional, but may be reported if desired. See Chapter 6 for details on how to submit annual follow -up information at a later date. 4. There is no time limit for making r evisions that give better information about the original diagnosis or stage. Data should be coded using the most accurate information available for an up -to-date and factual database. Over time, information that was missing when the case was first abstra cted may be added to the patient's medical record. Such additions may contain new information. The latest or most complete information available should be used. Thus, it is acceptable to change the primary site, histology, and extent of disease (staging data) as information becomes more complete. Note: This does not mean that if the patient's disease progresses, you should change the original stage to a higher stage. Staging should reflect only information available through completion of surgery(ies) in the first course of treatment or within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer. However, if the original stage is later found to be incorrect, it would be appropriate to change the stage to the correct code. Coding Instructions Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 28 GENERAL ABSTRACTING INSTRUCTIONS AND DEFINITIONS 1. Each primary cancer should be abstracted only once by a facility. However, if a patient is diagnosed with more than one primary cancer, whether simultaneously or at different times, a separate abstract must be completed for each primary cancer. 2. Enter all information accurately. Entries on the paper abstract should be printed legibly. 3. The following terms are used throughout this chapter to indicate type, justification, and length of data fields: Numeric: The field will accept numbers only. Alphabe tic: The field will accept letters only. Alphanumeric: The field will accept either letters or numbers, but no special characters. Text: The field will accept any letter, number, symbol, or space. Left-Justified: Data are to be entered starting at the firs t space toward the left. Leave unused spaces blank unless otherwise instructed. Right -Justified: Data are to be entered so that the last character falls in the last space on the right in the field. Leave unused spaces blank or zero fill, as directed. Length: Length refers to the number of characters in each data field. 4.

The Facility ID number identifies the facility reporting the case. It also allows the State Registry to collect information from multiple facilities that have seen the same patient for the same tumor. In the State Cancer Registry database, up to ten different facility ID numbers can be recorded for each tumor. Each of the ten facilities can be listed with its admission date, accession year and number, medical record number, and class of case for that tumor. Instruction Referring to Appendix D, enter your 3 -digit facility ID number in this field. Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identificatio n Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 38 Item Length: 10 Data Type: Numer ic ACoS: Required State Registry: Required NPI-REPORTING FACILITY NAACCR Item # 545 Description This is a required 10 -character field that identifies the facility submitting the data in the record. NPI (National Provider Identifier) is a unique identification number for hea lth care providers implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Rationale Each facility's NPI is unique. The number is essential to National Cancer Database (NCDB) for monitoring data submissions, ensuring the accuracy of data, and for identifying areas for special studies. Codes NPI numbers for Indiana facilities are provided in Appendix D of this manual. Instructions a. NPI-Reporting Facility is automatically coded by the software provider. b. NPI should be recorded as available for cases diagnosed during 2007, and is required to be recorded for all cases diagnosed January 1, 2008. c. NPI may be blank for cases diagnosed on or before December 31, 2006.

Rationale This item is most useful for multi -staffed registries and can be used for quality control and management. Instructions a. Record the initials or assigned code of the individual who abstracted this case. If t he initials are less than three characters, left justify and blank fill. b. Do not code the data entry person unless that person is also the abstractor. Instructions for RMCDS Facilities a. The initials will automatically be entered in each abstract base d on the identification used to log in. b. The initials automatically entered may be manually changed if a second abstracter completes a case in a session logged in by someone else. Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identificatio n Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 40 Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: N/A State Registry: Required TYPE OF REPORTING SOURCE NAACCR Item # 500 Data item revised for cases diagnosed 01/01/2006 and later. Description This is a required 1 -character field for coding the source documents used to abstract the majority of information for the tumor being reported. The item is intended to indicate the completeness of information available to the abstractor. Rationale The code in this field can be used to explain why information for a tumor may be incomplete. For example, death certificate only cas es have unknown values for many data items, so one may want exclude them from some analyses. The field also is used to monitor the success of non -hospital case reporting and follow -back mechanisms. All population -based registries should have some death certificate -only cases where no hospital admission was involved, but too high a percentage can imply both shortcomings in casefinding and that follow -back to uncover missed hospital reports was not complete. Codes (effective for cases diagnosed 01/01/2006 and later) 1 Hospital inpatient; managed health plans with comprehensive, unified medical records 2 Radiation Treatment Centers or Medical Oncology Centers (hospital -affiliated or independent) 3 Laboratory only (hospital -affiliated or independen t) 4 Physician's office/private medical practitioner (LMD) 5 Nursing/convalescent home/hospice 6 Autopsy only (diagnosed at autopsy) 7 Death certificate only 8 Other hospital outpatient units/surgery centers Notes : a. Code in the following priority order: 1, 2, 8, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7. This is a change to reflect the addition of codes 2 and 8 (for cases diagnosed 01/01/2006 and later) and to prioritize laboratory reports over nursing home reports. Facilities previously defined under code 1 have been split between codes 1, 2, and 8. b. Use the code that reflects the source documents used to abstract the majority of information for the tumor being reported. This may not be the source of original case finding. For example, if a case is identified through a pathology laboratory report review and all source documents used to abstract the case are from the physician's office, record code 4. Definitions a. Code 1 includes hospitals as well as specified managed health plans. Reports from health plans (e.g., Kaiser, Veterans Administration, military facilities), in which all diagnostic and treatment information is maintained centrally and available to the abstractor, are expected to be at least as complete as reports for hospital inpatients. Therefore , these sources are grouped with inpatients and given the code with the highest priority. b. Code 2 includes (radiation or medical) cancer treatment facilities, whether they are affiliated with a hospital or not. These sources usually have complete infor mation on the cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment. c. Code 3 is generally for use by independent pathology laboratories. If a hospital's pathology department has a report on a non -hospital case (with no inpatient or outpatient record) and no other information is available, code 3 should be used. For example, a hospital that finds a reportable case by reviewing pathology reports should report the case as Reporting Source 3 if no other records or Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 41 information were available. This might happen if an ou tside physician contracted to use the hospital's pathology laboratory facilities. d. Code 4 includes physician offic es as well as independent, free standing clinics with no hospital affiliation and that are not defined under Code 2. Examples of these may include surgery centers with no hospital affiliation and HMOs. e. Codes 6 and 7 are used only when investigation can find no clinical diagnosis of any kind while the patient was alive. f. Code 8 sources would include, but would not be limited to, hospita l outpatient surgery and nuclear medicine services. A physician's office that calls itself a surgery center should be coded as a physician's office. Surgery centers are equipped and staffed to perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia. If a p hysician's office calls itself a surgery center, but cannot perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia, code as a physician office. Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identificatio n Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 42 SUSPENSE CASE Description This is an optional 1 -character field in the RMCDS abstract screen to record a code that identifies an incomplete record (suspense, premalignant). Records identified as incomplete will be bypassed when normal edits are applied. A suspense sys tem can be created using this field by printing a suspense list of the incomplete cases. The paper Hospital Abstract does not include this field, since the suspense system for paper abstractors is created by a separate filing of the abstracts or by using index cards. Facilities using other vendors' registry programs should follow the applicable vendor's instructions for suspense cases. Codes 1 Partial record (suspense, premalignant, incomplete) 0 Complete record Instructions a. Record a 1 in the suspen se field for cases that have not been completely abstracted. b. When the record is completely abstracted, change the code and apply edits to the record. c. Refer to Chapter 2, Section D for requirements related to suspense systems. Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: N/A State Registry: Optional Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 43 PATIENT LAST NAME NAACCR Item # 2230 Description This is a required 40-character field for the patient's last name. Left justify and leave unused space(s) at the right blank. Instructions a. In a hyphenated last name, record the hyphen ( -) between the two surnames (last names). This might happen when a female marries and keeps her maiden name as part of her legal married name. Example: SMITH -WALBRIDGE b. Do not enter periods, apostrophes, blank spaces, punctuation, or other special characters (e.g., Jr, III) within the name. Example 1: OHARA (NOT O'HARA) Example 2: MCDONALD (NOT MC DONALD ) Example 3: STPIERRE (NOT ST. PIER RE OR SAINT PIERRE) Note: The 2018 STORE allows blanks, spaces, and apostrophes in the last name field. However, changing the name format at this point would compromise the linking or matching of new cases with cases previously entered in the registry. Therefore, it is advisable to continue following the old formatting rules. c. Update the field if a patient changes his/her last name. If a patient changes his/her legal name, enter the patient's most current legal name and put previous last name in the field for birth surname. If a patient has more than one tumor, previous records with different last names (AKA's) should be updated to show the most recent name change. The old name should be recorded in Birth Surn ame. Example: Jane White, who had a pr imary in 2017 , marries in 2018 and becomes Jane Black. In 2021 she has a second primary. Change the last name in the 2017 abstract from White to Black and record White in Birth Surname . Record the same names for the 2021 primary: Black (White in Birth Surname ). d.

It will provide a referral pattern report and allow analysis of cancer clusters or environmental studies. Address at diagnosis may be corrected, but never changed or updated. Changing this field would destroy its usefulness. Rules and Definitions: Use the following guidelines for all patient address data items. a. Record the patient's usual residence when the cancer was diagnosed. Normally a residence is the home named by t he patient. Do not use a temporary address, such as a winter or vacation home. Legal status and citizenship are not factors in residency decisions. Rules of residency are identical to or comparable with rules used by the Census Bureau whenever possible. The registry can resolve residency questions by using the Census Bureau's definition: \"The place where he or she lives and sleeps most of the time or the place the person considers to be his or her usual home.\" Vital statistics rules may differ from ce nsus rules. Do not record residence from the death certificate. Review each case carefully and apply the rules. b. Do not use current address. Record the address for the patient's home when he/she was diagnosed with cancer for both analytic and nonanal ytic cases. If all or any part of the address is unknown, follow the instructions for unknowns under the applicable item heading in the following pages. c. Rules for persons without apparent residences: (1) Persons with More than One Residence (summer a nd winter homes): Use the address the patient specifies if a usual residence is not apparent. (2) Persons with No Usual Residence (transients, homeless): Use the address of the place they were staying when the cancer was diagnosed. This could be a shel ter or the diagnosing facility. (3) Persons Away at School : College students are residents of the school area. Boarding school children below college level are residents of their parents' home. (4) Persons in Institutions : The Census Bureau states, \"P ersons under formally authorized, supervised care or custody\" are residents of the institution. This includes: Incarcerated persons Persons in nursing, convalescent, and rest homes Persons in homes, schools, hospitals, or wards for the physically disabled, mentally retarded, or mentally ill Long -term residents of other hospitals, such as Veterans Administration (VA) or military hospitals (5) Persons in the Armed Forces and on Maritime Ships : Members of the armed forces are residents of the installation area. Use the stated address for military personnel and their family. Military personnel may use the installation address or the surrounding community's address. The Census Bureau has detailed residency rules for Naval personnel, Coas t Guard, and maritime ships. Refer to Census Bureau publications for the detailed rules. Patient Address - Current The State Registry does not collect the patient's current address, although there are separate fields in the RMCDS program for recording it . Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 49 PATIENT ADDRESS (NUMBER AND STREET) AT DIAGNOSIS NAACCR Item # 2330 Description This is a required 60-character field for the patient's house number and street address at the time of diagnosis. Enter the house number and street name or the rural mailing address. This may or may not be the patient's current address. If the patient has multiple tumors, the address may be differe nt for each primary. See \"General Guidelines for Recording Patient Address at Diagnosis\" for detailed residency rules. Rationale The address is a part of the patient's demographic data and has multiple uses. It indicates referral patterns and allows for analysis of cancer clusters or environmental studies. Instructions a. Record the number and street address of the patient's usual residence when the cancer was diagnosed. Do not record a post office box number unless it is the only address available. b. Avoid using punctuation, except when necessary to convey the meaning. Limit punctuation to periods when the period carries meaning (e.g., 39.2 RD), slashes for fractional addresses (e.g., 101 1/2 MAIN ST), and hyphens when the hyphen carries meaning (e. g., 289 -01 MONTGOMERY AVE). Avoid using the pound sign (#) to designate address units whenever possible. If a pound sign is used, there must be a space between the pound sign and the secondary number. c. Do not update this data item if the patient's add ress changes. d. Use standard abbreviations recognized by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). The USPS Postal Addressing Standards, Pub 28, November 2000 can be found on the Internet at http://pe.usps .com/text/pub28/welcome.htm .

The code pinpoints residence at diagnosis within a geographic area smaller than the county of residence. Census tract is collected to meet the requirements of the Federal cancer registries grant. Rationale Census tract co des allow central registries to calculate incidence rates for geographical areas having population estimates. This field allows a central registry to add Year 2000 Census tract to cases diagnosed in previous years. Definition Census tract codes originate from the Bureau of the Census and are constructed using the patient's address. The boundaries of census tracts are established cooperatively by local committees and the Census Bureau. The corresponding population of the census tract area can be obtained from the Census Bureau. Codes are available from state health departments or the Bureau of the Census. Instructions a. The State Cancer Registry will code this item using computerized methods based on the patient's address at diagnosis. If your facilit y already collects census tract, please contact the State Registry to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. The field is described here for general informational purposes. b. When coding census tract, the decimal point is assumed to be between the fou rth and fifth positions of the field. Zeros are added to fill all six positions. Example 1: Census tract 409.6 (0409.60) would be coded 040960. Example 2: Census tract 516.21 (0516.21) would be coded 051621.

Record the patient's date of birth as documented in the patient record. Use the full four-digit year for year. Determine whether your software vendor uses the traditional format for date entry (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. b. For in utero diagnosis and treatment, record the actual date of birth. The date of birth will follow one or both dates for those events. c. If only the patient age is available, calculate the year of birth from age and the year of diagnosis and leave day and month of birth spaces blank. Example: The patient is 60 years old when admitted to the hospital on June 15, 2001 and no birth date is given. Record _ _/_ _/1941 or 1941/_ _/_ _, depending on the date format your software uses. Leave the month and day spaces blank. d. If month is unknown, th e day is coded unknown. If the year cannot be determined, code day and month as unknown. e.

It may also serve as an additional measure of socioeconomic status. Instructions a. Record the patient's usual occupation (that is, the kind of work performed during most of the patient's working life before diagnosis of this tumor). This may be different from the occupa tion at the time of diagnosis. b. Do not record \"retired .\" Do not add , \"retired ,\" to the usual occupation. (e.g., record \"registered nurse\" not \"retired registered nurse.\" ) c. Do not record \"disabled,\" \"unemployed,\" or \"institutionalized\" if the patient was ever employed. Record the longest -held occupation. d. If self -employed, specify the kind of work performed. (e.g., \"self -employed auto mechanic\") e. If usual occupation is not available or is unknown, record the patient's current or most recent occupa tion or any known occupation. f. If the patient was a homemaker ( housewife/househusband ) and also worked outside the home during most of his/her adult life, record usual occupation outside the home.

Rationale Both occupation and business/industry are required to accurately describe an individual's occupation. The item may be used to identify new work -related health hazards and to identify worksite -related groups in which cancer screening or prevention activities may be beneficial. It may also serve as an additional measure of socioeconomic status. Instructions a. Record the primary type of activity car ried on by the business/industry where the patient was employed for the most number of years before diagnosis of this tumor. This may be different from the company or industry of the patient's occupation at the time of diagnosis. b. Be sure to distinguis h among \"manufacturing,\" \"wholesale,\" \"retail,\" and \"service\" components of an industry that performs more than one of these components. c. If the primary activity carried on at the location where the patient worked is unknown, it may be sufficient to rec ord the name of the company ( with city or town) for which the patient performed his/her usual occupation. d. If only current or most recent occupation ( rather than usual occupation ) is documented , record the patient's current or most recent business/indus try. e.

Item Length: 100 Data Type: Text ACoS: N/A State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 75 OTHER PRIMARY TUMOR(S ) Description This is a required text field in the paper and RMCDS abstracts for recording any other primary, malignant tumors from the patient's history, or other primary tumors diagnosed simult aneously with or after the tumor being reported. Facilities using other types of registry software should follow their vendor's instructions for recording text about other primary tumors. Rationale Text is needed to justify the codes selected for the data items and to record information that is not coded at all. The text is used for quality control and special studies. Instructions a. Record site, histology, date of diagnosis, and sequence number for all other primary, malignant tumors from the patie nt's history, or other primary tumors diagnosed simultaneously with or after the tumor being reported. Example: Right breast, infiltrating duct carcinoma, July 1980, 01 b. Follow the SEER 2021 Solid Tumor Coding Rules (a comprehensive revision of the 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules ). c. If the person does not have, or has not had, another primary, malignant tumor, record \"None.\" Data Type: Text ACoS: N/A State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identificatio n Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 76 DATE OF FIRST CONTACT (INPATIENT OR OUTPATIENT ADMISSION DATE) NAACCR Item # 580 Description This is a required 8 -character field for the date the patient was first seen at or first admitted to your hospital for this tumor after your reference date. Use whichever date is earlier. Determine whether your software vendor uses the traditional format for date entry (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. Codes Month Day Year 01 January 01 Use four -digit year (e.g., 2021 ) 02 February 02 blank = Year unknown 03 March 03 04 April ... 05 May ... 06 June 25 07 July 26 08 August ... 09 September 30 10 October 31 11 November blank = Day unknown 12 December blank Month unknown Instructi ons a. Record the first (earliest) date the patient was seen at your facility as either an inpatient or outpatient for diagnosis and/or first course treatment of a reportable tumor. The date may be the date of an outpatient visit for a biopsy, x -ray, or l aboratory text, or the dat e a pathology specimen was collected at the facility. b. For analytic cases ( Class of Case 00-22), the Date of First Contact is the date the patient became analytic. For non -analytic cases, it is the date the patient first quali fied for the Class of Case that causes the case to be abstracted. c. If the patient was first seen as an outpatient , enter the date the patient was first seen in the outpatient department for this primary tumor. For cases diagnosed by scans or x -rays on an outpatient basis at your hospital and then admitted to your hospital, record the date of the scan or x -ray. If patient returned for subsequent outpatient visits, use only the initial date. Example: A patient has an MRI of the brain on December 7, 2014 for symptoms of severe headache and disorientation. The MRI findings are suspicious for astrocytoma. Surgery is performed on December 19, 201 4, removing all gross tumor. Date of First Contact is December 7, 201 4. d. For cases diagnosed in the staf f physician's office and then referred to your hospital for first course of therapy, record the date the patient was physically first seen at your hospital as an inpatient or outpatient. Example: A biopsy is performed in a staff physician's office on Sept ember 8, 201 4. The biopsy specimen is read at the reporting facility's pathology department as malignant melanoma. The patient presents to the reporting facility for wide re -excision on September 14, 201 4. Date of First Contact is September 14, 201 4. Item Length: 8 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 77 e. For cases diagnosed at another hospital, the date of first contact would be the date first seen at your hospital for treatment of this tumor, even if the patient was previously seen at your hospital as a consultation or for other reasons and no treatme nt was given for cancer. f. If the primary was diagnosed during a long-term hospitalization (those in nursing homes, psychiatric facilities, or VA hospitals), use the date of diagnosis as the date of first contact. Example: A patient has been an inpatien t for several months at a Veterans Administration Hospital for an unrelated illness. After having been hospitalized for several months a new primary is discovered during a routine exam. Enter the date the diagnosis was made, rather than the date the pati ent was first admitted to the VA Hospital. g. If the cancer was not suspected while the patient was alive and hospitalized, but was an incidental finding on post mortem exam ( autopsy ), use the date of death as the date of first contact. There must be no suspicion of cancer prior to autopsy. h. For cases diagnosed at your hospital prior to your reference (starting) date, record the first date seen for that malignancy after your reference date. i. For pathology -only cases, record the date on which the spe cimen was collected. j. If the date of first contact cannot be determined at all, leave the date of first contact field blank and record the reason in Date of First Contact Flag . See the Date of First Contact Flag section for examples illustrating the relationships among these i tems. Coding Tip: The year in the Date of First Contact item should match the first four digits of your hospital accession number for most patients' first primary (unless patient was admitted at the end of one year and not diagnosed until the next year ). Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identificatio n Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 78 DATE OF 1ST CONTACT FLAG NAACCR Item # 581 Description This flag explains why there is no appropriate value in the corresponding date field, Date of 1st Contact (NAACCR Item #580). This data item was added to Volume II Version 12 (effective January 2010). Rationale Prior to version 12 (through 2009 diagnos is), date fields included codes that provided information other than dates. As part of an initiative to standardize date fields, new fields were introduced to accommodate non-date information that had previously been transmitted in date fields. Codes 12 A valid date is applicable but not known. (The date of 1st contact is unknown.) Blank A valid date is coded in the Date of 1st Contact item (NAACCR Item #580). Instructions a. Leave this item blank if Date of 1st Contact has a full or partial date reco rded. b. Use code 12 if the 1st Contact cannot be determined at all. c. Code this data item (when appropriate) even if your software uses the traditional format for date entry. Examples: Description Date (Leave unknown portions blank.) Date of First Contact Flag Full date known *01/08/ 2021 or 2021 /01/08 Blank * For date entry, your software may use the traditional format (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. The computer will store either in the interoperable format. Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 79 HOSPITAL ACCESSION NUMBER NAACCR Item # 550 Description This is a required 9-character field for the unique number assigned to each cancer patient seen at your hospital. The first 4 digits indicate a year (YYYY) and the next 5 digits indicate a sequential number (#####) in which the cancer was first entered into the registry, so that the accession number is recorded as YYYY#####. Each new calendar year starts over again on January 1 with accession number 00001. Instructions a. Assign accession numbers on a sequential basis, with the first four digits indicating the year the patient was first seen at your facility for the diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer. The last five digits indicate the numerical order in which the registry entered the case for that ca lendar year. b. The first four digits of the accession number are based on the date the patient was first seen for the diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer at your hospital following your registry's reference date. The \"reference date,\" which always begi ns on January 1 of a given year, is the date the hospital first started their registry. Therefore, the first four digits of the accession number is never less than the registry's reference date unless the reference date is changed (see Exception below). Example: If you began reporting cancer cases to the State Cancer Registry when the requirement began on January 1, 1987 and continue to report only for state requirements, your reference date would be January 1, 1987. All cases in your registry should hav e an accession number of 1987_ _ _ _ _ or higher. Exception: If a patient is first accessioned into the registry, then the registry later changes its reference date and the patient is subsequently accessioned into the registry with a new primary, use the original accession number associated with the patient and code the sequence appropriately. Example: A patient is diagnosed by the hospital with prostate cancer in 1991 and assigned accession number 199100067. The registry later sets a new reference d ate of January 1, 1997. The same patient is admitted and diagnosed with lymphoma in 2021 . Use accession number 199100067 and sequence 02 for the lymphoma case. c. Enter leading zeros for numbers less than five digits. Example: A patient is first admitt ed to your facility for treatment of cancer in 2021 . The first four digits of the accession number are 2021 . If the patient is the 25th patient to be accessioned (entered) in your registry in 2021 , the last five digits of the accession number would be 00 025. The full accession number for this patient would be 20 2100025. d. Assign a unique accession number to each patient. A patient cannot have more than one accession number at your facility. Patients who contract a second or third primary cancer retai n the same 9 -digit accession number for primaries. (The sequence number will distinguish between the various primaries.) Before assigning an accession number to a patient, check your alphabetic index to see if the patient has ever been entered in your re gistry before. Do not assign a new accession number to a patient who already has another accession number. Item Length: 9 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 80 Example: John Smith was first seen and diagnosed at your hospital in 1999 with a primary cancer of the prostate. He was assigned accession number 199900010 -00 (1999 is the year first accessioned, 00010 is the accession number, and 00 is the sequence number). In 2021 , he was diagnosed with a second primary cancer of the pancreas. The accession number for the pancreatic primary would be 199900010 -02. The patient will always keep his originally assigned accession number. Only the sequence number changes. The sequence number will distinguish the two primaries. e. Each new patient added to the registry should be given the next highest number in sequ ential order (202100001, 20 2100002, 20 2100003, etc.). The order patients are assigned an accession number within a particular year does not matter. Accession numbers do not need to be kept in date order of diagnosis, admission, discharge, or abstracting. For example, a case first seen in September 2021 (202100175) can have a lower accession number than a case first seen in July 20 21 (202100176). f. Do not skip over numbers to allow for earlier cases to be inserted later. Numeric gaps in accession numbe rs should occur only if a case is deleted from your database. Do not reuse the accession number for a different patient to avoid any chance of two cases having the same accession number. g. The first four digits of the accession number are the year in wh ich the patient was first seen at your hospital. If the patient's first primary was seen at another hospital and therefore was not recorded in your registry, enter the year the patient's earliest sequenced primary was diagnosed and/or treated at your facility. Example 1: Mary Jones was diagnosed with her first primary malignancy at Hospital A in 20 11. Hospital A gave her accession number 20 1100021 -00, since she was the 21st patient to be accessioned at Hospital A in 20 11. In 20 21, Mary Jones went to Hospital B with a second primary. Hospital B assigned her accession number 20 2100152 -02 since she was seen at hospital B for the first time in 20 21 and was the 152nd patient en tered in their registry. Hospital A should change their sequence number from 20 1100021 -00 to 201100021 -01. Example 2: A new primary for a patient initially diagnosed and admitted in 20 16 was not identified by the tumor registrar until 20 21. The first fo ur digits of the accession number would be 2016, based on the date of admission (date of first contact for this primary). It would not be 20 21, the year the primary was identified by the registrar. h. The first four digits of the accession number match the year recorded in Date of First Contact for the first accessioned primary (explained earlier in this chapter). Example 1: A patient who was first seen as an outpatient in 20 21 is the first patient to be entered into your registry in 20 21. His accession number would be 20 2100001. Exception: If the patient was first seen at your facility at the end of one year but was not diagnosed until the beginning of the next year, his accession number should be th e year he was diagnosed. Example 2: A patient first entered your hospital as an inpatient in December 20 19, but was not diagnosed until January 20 21. The first four digits of the accession number should be 2021, since the majority of the reports and serv ice for this cancer would be provided in 2021. Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 81 HOSPITAL SEQUENCE NUMBER NAACCR Item # 560 Description This is a required 2 -character field for the number that indicates the chronological order of this primary tumor in relation to other reportable, independent, malignant and non -malignant neoplasms diagnosed in the patient's lifetime. The sequence number reflects all of a patient's reportable tumors, not just th ose seen at your hospital. Rationale This data item is used to distinguish among cases having the same accession numbers, to select patients with only one malignant primary tumor for certain follow -up studies, and to analyze factors involved in the development of multiple tumors. Codes for Reportable Malignant or In Situ Primary Tumors: Code Definition 00 One malignant or in situ primary only in the patient's lifetime 01 First of two or more independent malignant or in situ primaries 02 Second of t wo or more independent malignant or in situ primaries 03 Third of three or more independent malignant or in situ primaries ... ... (actual sequence of this malignant or in situ primary) ... 59 Fifty-ninth of fifty-nine independent malignant or in situ prim aries 99 Unspecified malignant or in situ sequence number or unknown Note: When this field is left blank in the RMCDS program, the system defaults to code \"00.\" Codes for Non -Malignant Tumors and Nonreportable Malignant or In Situ Tumors: Code Definiti on 60 Only one non -malignant primary 61 First of two or more independent non -malignant primaries 62 Second of two or more independent non -malignant primaries ... ... (Consecutive number of non -malignant primaries) 87 Twenty -seventh of twenty -seven independent non -malignant primaries 88 Unspecified number of neoplasms in this category Definitions a. Hospital sequence number : The code indicating the sequencing of reportable neoplasms in the patient's lifetime, according to the informati on and rules of the hospital registry. b. Central sequence number : The code indicating the sequencing of reportable neoplasms in the patient's lifetime, according to the information and rules of the central registry. c. Reportable -by-agreement tumors : Diagnoses not required by CoC but defined as reportable by the facility's cancer committee or the state registry. Such diagnoses may be benign, borderline, or malignant. Diagnoses required by the NPCR and the Indiana State Cancer Registry, but not by CoC , include VIN III, VAIN III, and AIN. Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 82 Example: The State Registry requires the hospital to report vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III (VAIN III, 8077/2). The cancer committee adds VAIN III to their reportable -by- agreement list and decides to ac cession and abstract these cases to comply with State requirements. d. The following table* illustrates the Indiana State Cancer Registry (ISCR) sequence number series by type of neoplasm. Neoplasm ISCR Sequence (Numeric Series) Malignant (Behavior Code = 3) Includes AJCC T3, T4, or M1 Skin Squamous Cell diagnosed before 2003. 00-59 Pilocytic/ Juvenile Astrocytoma diagnosed 2001 and later (Report as 9421/ 3 unless primary site is optic nerve. ) 00-59 In Situ (Behavior Code = 2). Includes VIN III, VAIN III, AIN III. Includes Cervix CIS/CIN III diagnosed before 1996. 00-59 Cervix CIS/CIN III diagnosed 1996 -2002 98 Cervix CIS/CIN III diagnosed 2003 and later 60-87 PIN III 60-87 Borderline/Benign Intracranial and Central Nervous Skin Squamous Cell and Basal 2003 and later 60-87 *Adapted from the \"SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 .\" Instructions a. Use codes 00 -59 and 99 for reportable invasive or in situ neoplasms. b. Use codes 60 -88 for non -malignant neoplasms and nonreportable invasive or in situ neoplasms. c. Use Code 00 only if the patient has a single invasive or in situ primary. If the patient develops a subsequent invasive or in situ primary tumor, change the code for the first tumor from 00 to 01, and number subsequent tumors sequentially. Example 1: Use code 00 for a patient with no history of previous cancer is diagnosed within situ breast carcinoma January 13, 20 21. Example 2: Change the sequence to 01 for the January 13, 20 21 breast carcinoma when the patient is diagnosed with a subsequent skin melan oma on July 30, 20 21. Example 3: Assign sequence 02 to the skin melanoma diagnosed on July 30, 20 21 following a breast carcinoma diagnosed on January 13, 20 21. Use sequence 00 if there is no information available to indicate the patient has been diagnos ed with an earlier primary malignancy. Assume the tumor being reported is the first. A history of surgery such as hysterectomy or colectomy should not be interpreted as evidence of an earlier malignancy without confirmation, since surgery is also perform ed to treat benign conditions. d. Use sequence 99 only when there is information that suggests the possibility of an earlier malignancy, but the medical record does not document a definite diagnosis. Example: A patient is diagnosed in the reporting hospi tal with cancer of the colon. The medical record contains the statement, \"The patient recently had a salivary gland tumor removed. The patient does not know if the lesion was malignant.\" The registry assigns Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 83 sequence number 99 to the colon primary. The patient returns to the reporting facility a year later for prostate cancer treatment. The medical record states, \"The patient has a history of a malignant salivary gland tumor.\" Change the sequence number of the colon cancer from 99 to 02. Assign the s equence number 03 to the prostate cancer. e. If a patient has had a reportable tumor that the facility did not accession, it is accounted for in sequencing subsequent tumors. Example 1: Your hospital diagnoses a patient with colon cancer. The patient ha s a history of kidney cancer diagnosed and treated elsewhere. Assign sequence number 02 to the colon cancer. Example 2: A patient is diagnosed with breast cancer in 1985. Hospital A's reference date is 1987. In 20 21, this patient has a primary of the lu ng. Assign sequence number 02 to the lung cancer. f. Sequence numbers should be reassigned if the facility learns later of an unaccessioned tumor that would affect the sequence. g. If two or more primaries are diagnosed at the same time, assign the lowest sequence number to the diagnosis with the worst prognosis. If no difference in prognosis is evident, the decision is arbitrary. Example 1: A patient enters your facility with simultaneous invasive carcin oma of the cervix and invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon. Assign sequence number 01 to the colon primary and sequence number 02 to the cervix primary. Example 2: A patient has simultaneous adenocarcinoma in situ in a colon polyp and squamous cell carci noma in situ in a vocal cord polyp. Assign sequence numbers as you choose. Both primaries have similar prognoses. h. Use code 60 only if the patient has single non -malignant primary. If the patient develops a subsequent non -malignant primary tumor, cha nge the code for the first tumor from 60 to 61, and assign codes to subsequent non -malignant tumors sequentially. i. The sequence codes for malignant/in situ and non -malignant cases are assigned independently. Assign sequence 60 to the first non -malignan t tumor in a patient with a prior malignant or in situ primary with sequence number 00. Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 84 CLASS OF CASE NAACCR Item # 610 Description For a hospital registry, Class of Case divides cases into two groups. Analytic cases (codes 00 -22) are those that are required by CoC to be abstracted because of the program's primary responsibility in managing the cancer. Analytic cases are grouped according to the location of diagnosis and treatment. Treatment and outcome reports may be limited to analytic cases. Nonanalytic cases (codes 30 -49 and 99) may be abstracted by the facility to meet central registry requirements or because of a request by the facility's cancer program. Nonanaly tic cases are grouped according to the reason a patient who received care at the facility is nonanalytic, or the reason a patient who never received care at the facility may have been abstracted. Class of Case can be used in conjunction with Type of Repor ting Source [500]. Type of Reporting Source is designed to document the source of documents used to abstract the cancer being reported. Rationale Class of Case reflects the facility's role in managing the cancer, whether the cancer is required to be repor ted by CoC, and whether the case was diagnosed after the program's Reference Date. Codes Analytic Classes of Case (Required by CoC to be abstracted by approved programs) 00 Initial diagnosis at the reporting facility AND all treatment or a decision not t o treat was done elsewhere 10 Initial diagnosis at the reporting facility or in an office of a physician with admitting privileges AND part or all of first course treatment or a decision not to treat was at the reporting facility, NOS 11 Initial diagnosis in an office of a physician with admitting privileges AND part of first course treatment was done at the reporting facility 12 Initial diagnosis in an office of a physician with admitting privileges AND all first course treatment or a decision not to treat was done at the reporting facility 13 Initial diagnosis AND part of first course treatment was done at the reporting facility 14 Initial diagnosis AND all first course treatment or a decision not to treat was done at the reporting facility 20 Initial diagnosis elsewhere AND all or part of first course treatment was done at the reporting facility, NOS 21 Initial diagnosis elsewhere AND part of treatment was done at the reporting facility 22 Initial di agnosis elsewhere AND all treatment was done at the reporting facility Classes of Case not required by CoC to be abstracted; required by Cancer Committee, state or regional registry, or other entity Patient appears in person at reporting facility 30 Initial diagnosis and all first course treatment elsewhere AND reporting facility participated in diagnostic workup (for example, consult only, staging workup after initial diagnosis elsewhere) 31 Initial diagnosis and all first course treatment elsewhere AN D reporting facility provided in -transit care 32 Diagnosis AND all first course treatment provided elsewhere AND patient presents at reporting facility with disease recurrence or persistence 33 Diagnosis AND all first course treatment provided elsewhere AN D patient presents at reporting facility with disease history only 34 Type of case not required by CoC to be accessioned (for example, a benign colon tumor) having initial diagnosis AND part or all of first course treatment by reporting facility 35 Case di agnosed before program's Reference Date, having initial diagnosis AND part or all of first course treatment by reporting facility 36 Type of case not required by CoC to be accessioned (for example, a benign colon tumor) having Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 85 initial diagnosis elsewhere A ND all or part of first course treatment by reporting facility 37 Case diagnosed before program's Reference Date, having initial diagnosis elsewhere AND all or part of first course treatment by facility 38 Initial diagnosis established by autopsy at the re porting facility, cancer not suspected prior to death Patient does not appear in person at reporting facility 40 Diagnosis AND all first course treatment given at the same staff physician's office 41 Diagnosis and all first course treatment given in two or more different offices of physicians with admitting privileges 42 Non-staff physician or non -CoC approved clinic or other facility, not part of reporting facility, accessioned by reporting facility for diagnosis and/or treatment by that entity (for example, hospital abstracts cases from an independent radiation facility 43 Pathology or other lab specimens only 49 Death certificate only 99 Case not required by CoC to be abstracted of unknown relationship to facility (not for use by CoC approved cancer programs for analytic cases.) Definitions a. Initial diagnosis : This refers to the first time a physician indicates that the patient has cancer. The initial diagnosis may be clinical or microscopic and it may be based on ambiguous terminology. b. Treatment : Treatment includes any first course activity coded as Surgical P rocedure of Primary Site, Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery, Surgical Procedure/Other Site, Radiation Treatment, Chemotherapy, Hormone Therapy, Immunotherapy, Hematologic Transplant and Endocrine Procedures , or Other Palliative care (undert aken to reduce the patient's symptoms) involving surgery, systemic treatment, or radiation is also coded as treatment and qualifies the patient as analytic if given as part of planned first course treatment. Decisions not to treat, whether initiated by the physician (contraindicating conditions) or by the patient (refusal), or decisions for active surveillance (\"watchful waiting\") are also considered treatment for assigning Class of Case. c. Physicians with admitting privileges : Physician s who are not employed by the reporting facility but are under contract with it or have routine admitting privileges there. Instructions a. Assign the Class of Case code th at most precisely describes the patient's relationsh ip to the facility. b. It is possible that information for coding Class of Case will change during the patient's first course of care. Change the Class of Case code accordingly if that occurs. If a patient has been accessioned into yo ur registry as an analytic case (codes 00 -22), do not reaccession or change the class of case code if the patient returns for a recurrence, subsequent treatment, or progression of disease involving the same primary. c. Assign code 00 only when it is known th at the patient went elsewhere for treatment. If it is not known that the patient actually went somewhere else, assign Class of Case code 10. d. Report all analytic cases ( codes 00 -22), to the State Cancer Registry. e. Report specified nonanalytic cases (codes 30, 32, 34 -38, 40 -41) that meet criteria described in Chapter 3 of this manual.

Data Type: Text ACoS: N/A State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 89 CASEFINDING SOURCE NAACCR Item # 501 *Required if available for cases diagnosed 01/01/2012 and later. Description This is a required 2 -character field for coding the source that first identified the tumor. For cases identified by a source other than reporting facilities (such as through death clearance or as a result of an audit), the codes reflect the type of source through which the tumor was first identified. Rationale This data item will help reporting facilities as well as regional and central registries in prioritizing their casefinding activities. It will identify reportable tumors that were first found through death clearance or sources other than traditio nal reporting facilities. It provides more detail than \"Type of Reporting Source.\" This data item cannot be used by itself as a data quality indicator. The timing of the casefinding processes (e.g., death linkage) varies from registry to registry, and the coded value of this variable is a function of that timing. Codes Case first identified at a reporting facility 10 Reporting hospital, NOS 20 Pathology department review (surgical pathology reports, autopsies, or cytology reports) 21 Daily discharge review (daily screening of discharged patients' records in the medical record /health information department) 22 Disease index review (review of the medical record /health information department 's disease index ) 23 Radiation therapy department/center 24 Laboratory report s (other than pathology reports defined for code 20) 25 Outpatient chemotherapy 26 Diagnostic imaging/radiology , includ ing nuclear medicine (other t han radiation therapy, code 23 ) 27 Tumor board 28 Hospital rehabilitation service or clinic 29 Other hospital source (including clinic, NOS or outpatient department, NOS) Case first identified by source other than a reportin g facility covered in the above codes (10-29) 30 Physician -initiated case 40 Consultation -only or pathology -only report (not abstracted by reporting hospital) 50 Independent (non -hospital) pathology -laboratory report 60 Nursing home -initiated case 70 Coroner's office records review 75 Managed Care Organization (MCO) or insurance records 80 Deat h certificate (case identified through death clearance) 85 Out-of-state case sharing 90 Other non -reporting hospital source 95 Quality control review (case initially identified through quality control activities such as casefinding audit of a regional or central registry) 99 Unknown Instructions 1. For State reporting, this item may be left blank for cases diagnosed before 2012. 2. Determine where the case was first identified and assign the appropriate code. If the case was first identified at a reporting facility (codes 10 -29), assign the code for the earliest source of identifying information (based on patient or specimen contact at the facility). Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: N/A State Registry: *Required Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 90 At the regional or central level, if a hospital and a non -hospital source identified the case independently of each other, the code for the non -hospital source should be assigned. Codes 30 -95 have priority over codes 10 -29. 3. If a death certificate, independent pathology laboratory report, consultation -only report from a hospital, or other report was used to identify a case that was then abstracted from a different source, assign the code for the source that first identified th e case, not the source from which it was subsequently abstracted. 4. If a regional or central registry identifies a case and asks a reporting facility to abstract it, assign the code that corresponds to the initial source, not the code that corresponds to the eventual reporting facility. Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 91 DATE OF INITIAL DIAGNOSIS NAACCR Item # 390 Description This is a required 8 -character field for the date this primary cancer was diagnosed by a recognized medical practitioner. Determine whether your software vendor uses the traditional format for date entry (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. Rationale The timing for staging and treatment of cancer begins with the date of initial diagnosis for cancer. Codes Month Day Year 01 January 01 Use four -digit year (e.g., 20 21) 02 February 02 blank = Year unknown 03 March 03 04 April ... 05 May ... 06 June 25 07 July 26 08 August ... 09 September 30 10 October 31 11 November blank = Day unknown 12 December blank Month unknown Definition This date refers to the date this cancer was diagnosed by any recognized medical practitioner. The first diagnosis is often clinical and may never be histologically confirmed. Refer to the list of terms that represent a clinical diagnosis in C hapter 4. Do not change the date of diagnosis when a later biopsy or cytology provides confirmation of a clinical diagnosis. Even if confirmed later, the diagnosis date refers to the date of the first clinical diagnosis and not to the date of confirmatio n. The date of the first clinical diagnosis provides a more accurate picture of the true survival time from date of diagnosis to death when determining survival statistics. Example 1: A March 12, 20 21 mammogram reveals a mass in the upper -outer quadrant of a patient's right breast compatible w ith carcinoma. On March 20, 2021 , the patient has an excisional breast biopsy that confirms infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Date of diagnosis is March 12, 20 21. Example 2: A physician notes a prostate nodule that i s suspicious for cancer during a May 11, 2021 physic al examination. On June 15, 2021 , an ultrasound guided needle biopsy of the prostate provides histologic confirmation of adenocarcinoma. Date of diagnosis is May 11, 2021 . Instructions a. If the physic ian says that in retrospect, the patient had cancer at an earlier date, use that earlier date as the date of diagnosis. When a tumor has been diagnosed as benign and a later medical or pathologic review of previous slides or x -ray films changes this to a diagnosis of a malignancy, the original date of diagnosis is considered to be the date of the initial slide or film review. In other words, the date of diagnosis is backdated. Item Length: 8 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 92 Example: A patient has a total abdominal hysterectomy for endometriosis in Jan uary 20 14. The patient is admitted with abdominal pain and distention in November 20 15. A laparoscopy with omental biopsy shows metastatic cystadenocarcinoma. Pathologists review the 20 14 hysterectomy specimen. They identify an area of cystadenocarcino ma in the left ovary. Date of diagnosis is January 20 14 (01/_ _/20 14). b. The date of the histology, cytology, or tissue exam should be used only if that is the first date the cancer was diagnosed or if the date of initial, clinical diagnosis is unknown and it is the earliest alternative confirmation. c. If the date of initial clinical diagnosis is unknown but the diagnosis has been confirmed microscopically or through radiologic or other exam, use the date of the histology, cytology, tissue, or radiolog ic exam, whichever is earlier. In some cases, this may be a date prior to admission. d. Use the date of first cancer -directed therapy as the date of diagnosis if the cancer -directed therapy was started prior to the definitive diagnosis of cancer. e. The date of death is the date of diagnosis for class of case code 38 (first diagnosed at autopsy) or 49 (death certificate only). f. Use the actual date of diagnosis for an in utero diagnosis, for cases diagnosed January 1, 2009 or later. g. For patients diagnosed prior to admission to your facility, record the date of diagnosis from the referring hospital, practitioner, or clinic, if known. If the date is unknown, record the best estimate as described in paragraph h. below. h. If you do not know the exact date of diagnosis, estimate the date based on available information. Recording an approximate date is preferable to recording an unknown date. Every attempt should be made to enter the month and day, even if an estimate is necessary. If there is no basis for approximation, leave the month and day spaces blank. If the year diagnosis cannot be identified, it must be approximated. In that instance, the month and day are unknow n. Leave the month and day spaces blank. I. If information is limited to a description, use the following: Descriptive Term Used Date Code Spring April The middle of the year July Fall October Winter Try to determine if this means the beginning of the year (January) or the end of the year (December). Code as indicated. j. If the date of diagnosis cannot be determined at all, leave the date of diagnosis blank and record the reason in Date of Diagnosis Flag . See the Date of Diagnosis Flag section for examples illustrating the relationships among these items. Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 93 DATE OF DIAGNO SIS FLAG NAACCR Item # 391 Description This flag explains why there is no appropriate value in the corresponding date field, Date of Diagnosis (NAACCR Item #390). Rationale Prior to version 12 (through 2009 diagnosis), date fields included codes that provided information other than dates. As part of an initiative to standardize date fields, new fields were introduced to accommodate non-date information that had previously be en transmitted in date fields. Codes 12 A valid date is applicable but not known. (The date of diagnosis is unknown.) Blank A valid date is coded in the Date of Diagnosis item (NAACCR Item #390). Instructions a. Leave this item blank if Date of Diagno sis has a full or partial date recorded. b. Use code 12 if the Date of Diagnosis cannot be determined at all. c. Code this data item (when appropriate) even if your software uses the traditional format for date entry. Examples: Description Date (Leave unknown portions blank.) Date of Diagnosis Flag Full date known *01/08/2021 or 2021 /01/08 Blank Month & year known *01/_ * For date entry, your software may use the traditional format (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. The computer will store either in the interoperable format. Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: N/A State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 94 PRIMARY SITE NAACCR Item #400 Description This is a required 4-character field for recording the topography (anatomic site) code that best describes the primary site of malignancy. Metastatic lesions are NEVER coded in this field. Review the entire medical record before assigning this code. General Instructions a. Enter the topography (anatomic site) code from the Topography section of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition, 2000 ( ICD-O-3)* that best describes the primary site of the tumor. The topography code should first be loca ted in the Alphabetic Index (pages 105 - 218). Then the specific topography should be located in the Topography - Numerical List section (pages 45 -65). The Alphabetic Index includes both topography and morphology terms. *Note: ICD-O-3 is effective for c ases diagnosed January 1, 2001 forward. Continue to use ICD-O-2 for cases diagnosed prior to 2001 . b. For reportable solid tumors diagnosed January 1, 2018 or later, follow the instructions in ICD-O-3, pages 20 -40 and the SEER 2018 Solid Tumor Coding Rules (a comprehensive revision of the 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules ). Exception: For Cutaneous Melanoma and Other Sites (excluding rectosigmoid, rectum, and peripheral nerves), continue to use the 2007 Multipl e Primary and Histology Coding Rules and General Instructions. c. For lymphoma , leukemia and other hematopoietic neoplasms diagnosed 2010 and later use the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Manual and the Hematopoietic Data base. Do not use ICD-O-3 for the lymphoma , leukemia and other hematopoietic neoplasms diagnosed 2010 and later. d. Record the primary site as specifically as possible. For example, if the final diagnosis is \"cancer of the colon,\" review other reports in the medical record (e.g., operative note, pathology report, radiology reports, and physician progress notes) to ascertain whether a more specific site within the colon can be identified. e. It is important that the primary site be coded, rather than a metastatic site. The primary site is the location where the cancer first developed, or the site of origin of a tumor. A metastatic site is the location to which the cancer has spread, or metastasized, from the primary site. Ask your physician advisor to identify the primary site or the most definitive site code if the medical record does not contain that information. f. Use the subcategory 8 (C_ _.8) for single tumors that overlap the boundaries of two or more sub -sites and the point of origin i s unknown. Example 1: Code overlapping lesion (C10.8) when a large tumor involves both the lateral wall of the oropharynx (C10.2) and the posterior wall of the oropharynx (C10.3) and the point of origin is not stated. Example 2: Code overlapping lesion o f the bladder (C67.8) when one lesion involves the dome (C67.1) and the lateral wall (C67.2) and the point of origin is not stated. g. Use the subcategory 9 (C_ _.9) for multiple tumors that originate in multiple sub -sites of one organ. Item Length: 4 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 95 Example 1: Code b ladder, NOS (C67.9) when multiple lesions arise in both the trigone (C67.0) and lateral wall (C67.2). Example 2: Code lung, NOS (C34.9) when there are lesions in both the right middle lobe (C34.2) and the right lower lobe (C34.3) of lung. Example 3: Code breast, NOS (C50.9) when there are lesions in both the left lower -inner quadrant (C50.3) and the left lower -outer quadrant (C50.5) of a breast. Note: When multiple tumors are all located in the same quadrant of the breast, code the specific quadrant. h. If the specific site within an organ cannot be determined, code the primary site to the \"NOS\" (Not Otherwise Specified) category of the organ, organ system, or region. Refer to codes C76.0 to C76.8 (Other and Ill -Defined Sites) before coding C80.9 (Unk nown primary site). For occult cervical lymph node s and cutaneous carcinoma of the head and neck, follow the instructions under \"Diagnosis - Specific Instructions ,\" paragraphs c. and d. below. If an unknown site is later specifically identified, the primar y site code should be changed to the correct one. Example: Your hospital clinically diagnoses a patient with carcinomatosis. The registry enters the case as an unknown primary (C80.9), carcinoma, NOS (8010/3), stage of disease unknown. Nine months later a paracentesis shows serous cystadenocarcinoma. The physician states that the patient has an ovarian primary. Change the primary site to ovary (C56.9), histology to serous tive positive histology Kaposi sarcoma Code Kaposi sarcoma t o the site in which it arises. Code to skin (C44.9) if Kaposi sarcoma arises simultaneously in the skin and another site, and the primary site is not identified. b. Melanoma Code to Skin NOS (C44.9) if the diagnosis is metastatic melanoma and the primary site is not identified. c. Occult Cervical Lymph Node s For a head and neck primary lymph node involvement with no head and ne ck tumor found o r specified by a physician, code the primary site according to the instructions described below. Use code C76.0 if the neck node has not been tested or is negative for both HPV and EBV. Use code C10.9 if the neck node is p16 positive, indicating human papi llomavirus (HPV) and EBV negative or unknown . Use code C11.9 if the neck node is EBER positive, or both EBER and p16 positive, indicating Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). Code Schema Discriminator 1: Occult Head and Neck Lymph Nodes according to the SSDI Manual guidelines. The SSDI manual has further information for assigning the primary site code. d. Cutaneous Carcinoma of the Head and Neck For (non melanoma) skin cancers of overlapping sites in the head and neck only, assign the primary site code for the site where the bulk of the tumor is or where the epicenter is. Do not use code C44.8 (Overlapping lesion of skin). Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 96 e. If any of the following histologies appears with only an ill -defined site description (e.g., \"abdominal\" or \"arm\"), code it to the tissue in which such tumors arise rather than the ill -defined region (C76._) of the body, which contains multiple tissues. Histology ICD-O-3 Codes Code to This Subcutaneous, and Other vessel tumors 9120 -9170 C49._ Connective, Subcutaneous, and Other Soft Tissues soft part sarcoma 9580 cell tumors 9240 Bone and Cartilage C49._ Tissues -8941 C07._ Other and Unspecified Major Salivary Glands f.

Laterality refers to the primary site only and should be coded independently for each primary. Metastatic involvement is not coded. Codes 0 Not a paired or gan or site; not applicable; unknown primary site 1 Right side is origin of primary 2 Left side is origin of primary 3 Only one side is involved; right or left origin unspecified 4 Bilateral involvement, side of origin unknown; stated to be a single primar y. Includes: Both ovaries involved simultaneously with a single histology Bilateral retinoblastomas Bilateral Wilms tumors 5 Paired site: midline tumor 9 Paired site, but no information on laterality Instructions a. If only one histologic type is reported and if both sides of a paired site are involved within two months of diagnosis, determine whether the patient had one or two independent primaries. Refer to the SEER 2018 Solid Tumor Coding Rules . (1) If there are two primaries, prepare two abstracts, recording the appropriate laterality and extent of disease for each. (2) If there is only one primary (originated on one side and metastasized to the other), prepare a single abstract and code laterality according to the side where the primary originated. If it is not possible to determine the side where the primary originated, record laterality code 4 (bilateral involvement, lateral origin unknown). b. Record laterality for unknown primary site (C80.9) as 0 (not a paired organ or site). c. The following list identifies the paired organs or paired sites. For all sites that are not on the list, record laterality code 0 (not a paired organ; not applicable). The STORE laterality rules permit coding non-paired site s as right or left but the State Registry does not support this. Use laterality code 1 - 9 only for the following sites, except as noted. The listing includes only major categories. Code laterality for all subheadings included in ICD-O-3 under these he adings, unless specifically excluded.

Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 100 DIAGNOSTIC CONFIRMATION NAACCR Item # 490 Description This is a required 1 -character field for recording the best method of diagnostic confirmation of the cancer being reported at any time in the patient's history. It indicates whether at any time during the patient's disease course there was microscopic confirmation of the morphology of this cancer. Rationale This item is an indicator of the precision of diagnosis. The percentage of solid tumors that are clinically diagnosed only is an indication of whether casefinding procedures include source s outside of pathology reports. Complete casefinding must include both clinically and pathologically confirmed cases. Codes and Definitions for Solid Tumors (all tumors except M9590 -9993) 1 Positive histology Histologic confirmation (tissue microscopically Positive cytology Cytologic confirmation (no tissue microscopically examined; fluid cells microscopically examined). 4 Positive microscopic confirmation, method not specified Microscopic confirmation is all that is known. It is unknown if the cells were from histology or cytology. 5 Positive laboratory test/marker study A clinical diagnosis of cancer is based on laboratory tests/marker studies that are clinically diagnostic for cancer. Examples include alpha -fetoprotein for liver cancer . Elevated PSA is not diagnostic of cancer. If the physician uses the PSA as a basis for diagnosing prostate cancer with no other work -up, record as code 5. 6 Direct visualization without microscopic confirmation The tumor was visualized du ring a surgical or endoscopic procedure only with no tissue resected for microscopic examination. 7 Radiography and other imaging techniques without microscopic confirmation The malignancy was reported by the physician from an imaging technique report only. Diagnosed by radiology , including ultrasound, computed (axial) tomography (CT or CAT scans), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 8 Clinical diagnosis only (other than 5 , 6, or 7) The malignancy was reported by the physician in the medical record. Refer to ambiguous terminology in Chapter 4. 9 Unknown whether or not microscopically confirmed A statement of malignancy was reported in the medical record, but there is no s tatement of how the cancer was diagnosed (usually nonanalytic). Instructions for Coding Solid Tumo rs (all tumors except M9590 -9993 ) a. The codes are in priority order, with code 1 having the highest priority. Always code the diagnostic method with the l ower numeric value when the diagnosis of cancer is confirmed with multiple methods. Change this data item to the lower (higher priority) code if a more definitive method confirms the diagnosis at any time during the course of the disease. Example: A chest x -ray dated 02/01/ 2021 diagnoses a probable lung cancer. The patient refuses a diagnostic work -up. The registry codes the diagnostic confirmation to radiography (code 7). The patient allows a lymph node biopsy on 04/12/ 2021 . The biopsy confirms small cell carcinoma. Change the diagnostic confirmation code to positive histology (code 1). Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 101 b. Assign code 1 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on tissue specimens from biopsy, frozen section, surgery, autopsy, dilatation and curettage ( D & C), bone marrow biopsy or bone marrow aspiration (bone marrow FNA). c. Assign code 2 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on cytologic examination of cells. The cells may be recovered from fluid, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, urinary sediment, cervical and vaginal smears, or from paraffin -block specimen s from concentrated spinal, pleural, or peritoneal fluid. d. Assign code 4 when the case is reported as microscopically confirmed , but no information is provided about the method (histology, cytology). This may include cases where the medical record or p hysician states the histology type, but there is no path report in the record. e. Assign code 8 when the case was diagnosed by any clinical method not mentioned in preceding codes. A number of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms are diagnosed by tests o f exclusion where the tests for the disease are equivocal and the physician makes a clinical diagnosis based on the information from the equivocal tests and the patient's clinical presentation. f. If diagnosis was confirmed at another hospital, enter the code for how the other hospital confirmed the diagnosis, if known, unless further confirmation with a lower code occurred at your facility. (e.g., If the other hospital performed a mammogram and your hospital performed a biopsy, code the biopsy.) If unkn own, enter code 9. g. Some cytology specimens contain tissue. Some pathology/tissue specimens contain only cells or fluid aspiration. Read the report carefully to determine if the pathologist examined cells or tissue and code accordingly. Codes and Def initions for Hematopoietic Positive cytology Cytologic confirmation (no tissue microscopically examined; fluid cells microscopically examined). 3 Positive histology plus Positive immunophenotyping and/or Positive genetic studies Histology is positive for cancer, and there are also positive immunophenotyping and/or genetic test results. For example, bone marrow examination i s positive for acute myeloid leukemia (9861/3). Genetic testing shows AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) (9871/3). 4 Positive microscopic confirmation, method not specified Microscopic confirmation is all that is known. It is unknown if the cells w ere from histology or cytology. 5 Positive laboratory test/marker study A clinical diagnosis of cancer is based on laboratory tests/marker studies that are clinically diagnostic for cancer. 6 Direct visualization without microscopic confirmation The tumor was visualized during a surgical or endoscopic procedure only with no tissue resected for microscopic examination. 7 Radiography and other imaging techniques without microscopic confirmation The malignancy was reported by the physician from an imaging technique report only. 8 Clinical diagnosis only (other than 5, 6, or 7 ) The malignancy was reported by the physician in the medical record. Refer to ambiguous terminology in Chapter 4. 9 Unknown whether or not microscopically confirmed A statement of malignancy was reported in the medical record, but there is no statement of how the cancer was diagnosed (usually nonanalytic). Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 102 Instructions for Coding Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tumors (M9590 -9993) a. There is no priority hierarchy for coding Diagnostic Confirmation for hematopoietic and lymphoid tumors. Most commonly, the specific histologic type is diagnosed by immunophenotyping or genetic testing. See the Hematopoietic Database (DB) for information on the definitive diagnostic confirmation for specific types of tumors. b. Assign code 1 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on tissue specimens from biopsy, frozen section, surgery, autopsy or bone marrow specimens from aspiration or biopsy. c. For leukemia only, assign code 1 when the diagnosis is based only on the complete blood count (CBC), white blood count (WBC) or peripheral blood smear. Do not use code 1 if the diagnosis was based on immunophenotyping or genetic testing using tissue, bone marrow, or blood. d. Assign code 2 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on cytologic examination of cells (rather than tissue) including but not limited to spinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, urinary sediment, cervical or vaginal smears, or from paraffin block specimens from concentrated spinal , pleural, or peritoneal fluid. These methods are rarely used for hematopoietic or lymphoid tumors. e. Assign code 3 when there are a histology positive for cancer and positive immunophenotyping and/or positive genetic testing results. Do not use code 3 for neoplasm s diagnosed prior to January 1, 2010 f. Assign code 5 when the diagnosis of cancer is based on laboratory tests or marker studies that are clinically diagnostic for that specific cancer, but no positive histologic confirmation. g. Assign code 6 when the diagnosis is based only on the surgeon's report from a surgical exploration or endoscopy or from gross autopsy findings without tissue or cytological findings. h. Assign code 8 when the case was diagnosed by any clinical method not mentioned in preceding codes . A number of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms are diagnosed by tests of exclusion where the tests for the disease are equivocal and the physician makes a clinical diagnosis based on the information from the equivocal tests and the patient's clin ical presentation.

Use the ICD-O-3 references jointly with the rules listed below, as applicable . For all solid reportable tumors diagnosed January 1, 20 18 or later, use the SEER 2018 Solid Tumor Coding Rules (a comprehensive revision of the 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rule s). For 2021 the rules include an updated section for cutaneous melanomas. Exception : For Other Sites (excluding rectosigmoid, rectum, and peripheral nerves), continue to use the 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules and General Instructions . For lymphoma , leukemia, and other hematopoietic tumors diagnosed 2010 and later use the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Manual and the Hematopoietic Database. Do not use ICD-O-3 for the lymphoma , leukemia and other hematopoietic neoplasms diagnosed 2010 and later. Note: For cases diagnosed before to 2021 , refer to the applicable prior version of the Indiana State Cancer Registry Policy and Procedure Manual. a. Enter the five -digit code from the Morphology Section o f the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition, 2000 ( ICD-O-3)* that best describes the histologic (cell) type and behavior of this primary. First locate the morphology code in the Alphabetic Index (pages 105 - 218). Then loca te the specific morphology code in the Morphology of Neoplasms - Numerical List section (pages 69 - 104). Follow the coding rules outlined in ICD-O-3 on pages 20 - 40. *Note: ICD-O-3 is effective for cases diagnosed January 1, 2001 forward. Continue to use ICD-O-2 for cases diagnosed prior to 2001 . b. In the Alphabetic Index, all morphology codes are identified by an M - preceding the code number. Do not record the M on the abstract . Do not record the virgule (/ - slash ) on the abstract . Example: Infiltrating duct carcinoma is code M -8500/3. Record code 85003 . c. Review all pathology reports that describe the primary site before coding histology and behavior. Read each pathology report in its entirety. Although the report from the definitive cancer -directed surgery is usually the best source , sometimes all of the positive tissue is removed at biopsy. Example: The pathology report from a skin biopsy states malignant melanoma, NO S. At wide excision, no residual tumor was found. Code the histology from the biopsy report as malignant melanoma, NOS (8720/3). d. If no tissue or cytology specimen was obtained for a diagnosis of malignancy, but a recognized medical practitioner makes a clinical diagnosis of cancer, malignancy, malignant tumor, or malignant neoplasm, code to 8000/3 (Neoplasm, malignant). If the physician is more specific, use the more specific morphology code. Item Length: 4 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 104 The codes for cancer, NOS (8000/3) and carcinoma, NOS (8 010/3) are not interchangeable. If the physician says that the patient has carcinoma, code carcinoma, NOS (8010/3). Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 105 BEHAVIOR NAACCR Item # 523 Description The fifth digit, which follows the slash after the histology code, is the behavior code. Behavior codes are listed in ICD-O-3 page 66 and below. The State Cancer Registry requires only tumors ending in a fifth digit behavior code of /2 or /3 to be report ed. Note: ICD-O-3 is effective for cases diagnosed January 1, 2001 forward. Continue to use ICD-O-2 for cases diagnosed prior to 2001 . Codes /0 Benign ( do not report to State Registry ) Exception: Benign neoplasms of the brain and central nervous syste m diagnosed January 1, 2004 or later should be reported. /1 Borderline (do not report to State Registry ) Uncertain whether benign or malignant Borderline malignancy Low malignant potential Exceptions: Pilocytic/j uvenile astrocytoma, listed as 9421/1 in ICD -O-3, is required and should be reported as 9421/3 unless primary site is optic nerve which should be reported as non -malignant if diagnosed 2004 or later ; Borderline neoplasms of the brain and central nervous system diagnosed January 1, 2004 or later should be reported. /2 Carcinoma in situ ( report to Noninfiltrating Noninvasive prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III; and bas al cell and squamous cell carcinoma of nongenital skin are not reportable if diagnosed 01/01/2003 or later. /3 Malignant, primary site ( report to State Registry ) /6 Malignant, metastatic site ( do not use) Malignant, secondary site /9 Malignant, uncerta in whether primary or metastatic site ( do not use) Instructions for Behavior Code a. Since tumor registries include only primary, and not metastatic sites, behavior codes 6 and 9 should never be used. They are listed here for informational purposes only. b. Behavior codes /0 (benign) and /1 (uncertain or borderline) are not reportable to the State Cancer Registry unless listed under exceptions above. However, at the discretion of the cancer committee, a hospital may choose to collect some of these cases , which are called \"reportable -by-agreement.\" The behavior codes are listed here for informational purposes only. Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 106 c. The behavior code /6 indicates a metastatic site. If the only specimen available for diagnosis was from a metastatic site, code the hist ologic type of the metastatic site and code a /3 for the behavior code. If the primary site is known, record the applicable topography code. If the primary site is unknown, the topography code should be C80.9. Example: If the patient had a biopsy of the lung showing metastatic adenocarcinoma (8140/6), the primary site is unknown histology to adenocarcinoma (8140/3). d. \"In situ\" is a concept based upon histologic evidence. Therefore, clinical evidence alone cannot justify the usag e of this term. If the fifth digit in Histology/Behavior is coded /2 (in situ), diagnostic confirmation should be 1, 2, or 4. The following terms are synonymous with in situ (fifth digit behavior code /2): (Adeno)carcinoma in an adenomatous polyp with no invasion of III - intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III (C21.1, Bowen disease Cervical intraepithelial grade III (C53._, Clark's (C50._, epithelium High grade dysplasia in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Confirm that the pathologist uses \"high grade dysplasia\" for in situ in the GI tract.) Hutchinson melanotic freckle, NOS (C44._, 8742/2) Intraepidermal, NOS (carcinoma) Intraepithelial, NOS (carcinoma) Involvement up to but not including the No stromal involvement or invasion (If there is stromal invasion, it is not in situ.) Papillary, noninfiltrating or intraductal (carcinoma) grade III (C52.9, 8077/2) VIN neo plasia, grade III (C51._, 8077/2) e. Code behavior as malignant (/3) if any malignant invasion is present, no matter how limited. Any pathologic diagnosis qualified as \"microinvasive\" is not considered \"carcinoma in situ\" and behavior should be coded as malignant (/3). Example: The pathology report from a hysterectomy reads \"carcinoma in situ (8010/2) of the cervix with microinvasion.\" Code to invasive carcinoma (8010/3). f. Code behavior as malignant (/3) if any malignant metastasis to nodes or tissu e beyond the primary is present. Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 107 g. Gastro -intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and thymomas are frequently non -malignant. However, they must be assigned a behavior code of 3 and abstracted if they have multiple foci, metastasis or positive lymph nodes. Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 108 SCHEMA ID NAACCR Item # 3800 Description Schema ID (item # 3800) will be derived by registry software based on site and histology codes entered by the registrar. For cases diagnosed 2018 and later , Schema ID is used to link all combinations of sites and histologies with the appropriate stage data collection systems, grade tables, and site -specific data items (SSDI ). Item Length: 5 ACoS: Derived State Registry: Derived Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 109 GENERAL RULES FOR CODING GRADE Grade Data Items For cases diagnosed 01/01/2018 and forward grade will be coded in three different data items that replace the historical grade/differentiation item and the Site -Specific Factors for sites with alternative grading systems (e.g., Bloom -Richardson score for breast and Gleason score for prostate) . Grade Clinical : The grade of a solid primary tumor before any treatment. Grade Post-Therapy Clinical: The grade of a solid primary tumor that has been microscopically sampled following neoadjuvant therapy. (01/01/2021 and forward) Grade Pathological : The grade of a solid primary tumor that has been resected and for which no adjuvant therapy was administered. Grade Post-Therapy Path: The grade of a solid primary tumor that has been resected follow ing neoadjuvant therapy. Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms (9590/3 For forward, cell lineage indicator/grade (B -cell, T -cell, Null cell, K -cell) will no longer be collected for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms . Use code 8 (not applicable) in the three grade fields for all cases with histologies 9590/3 -9993/3, except for Lymphoma the histologies collected in the Lymphoma Ocular Adnexa chapter 71 of the AJCC manual. Solid Tumors a. The grade codes and instructions depend on the type of cancer (schema -specific for site and/or histology). The 2018 Grade Manual must be used to access the schema -specific grade tables and instructions at https://www.naaccr.org/SSDI/Grade -Manual.pdf . Once the Schema ID has been derived, based on site and histology -specific factors, the software may identify the correct options for coding grade. In the RMCDS system, the options are shown by clicking the SSDI button at the bottom of the screen and using the \"look -up\" feat ure. b. The grade codes have been revised to include numeric and alphabetic codes in grade tables that vary by site -specific schema. The schema -specific tables will include some combination of the codes and descriptions listed in the template below. Template for Grade Codes Code Grade Description 1 Site-Specific grade system category 2 Site-Specific grade system category 3 Site-Specific grade system category 4 Site-Specific grade system category 5 Site-Specific grade system category L Low grade Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 110 Code Grade Description H High grade M Site-Specific grade system category S Site-Specific grade system category A Well differentiated B Moderately differentiated C Poorly differentiated D Undifferentiated and anaplastic 8 Not applicable (hematopoietic neoplasm only) 9 Grade cannot be assessed; unknown Blank (Post -therapy only.) Codes 1 -5 are applicable for the AJCC -recommended grading systems. Not all tables will have 5 codes. Codes L and H are used for cancers where \"low grade\" and \"high grade\" are applicable, e.g., urinary cance rs with urothelial histologies. Codes A -D are the generic grade categories used historically and are still applicable where there is no preferred grading system , the recommended grading system is not documented , or there is no AJCC chapter for the primary site . Codes A -D are not available for all cancers. c. Code the grade from the primary tumor only, not from a metastatic site or recurrence. If the tumor extends contiguously to an adjacent site and tissue is not available from the primary site, code grade from the adjacent site. If the primary site is unknown, code grade to 9. d. If there is more than one grade documented for one of the grade data items, code the grade according to the priority order specified in schema -specific instructions. If there is no priority order specified, code the highest grade. e. Code gr ade from the invasive component if there are invasive and in situ components present. f. Code grade for an insitu only tumor if it is documented. Do not code grade for dysplasia , such as high - grade dysplasia.

Facilities using other types of registry software should follow their vendor's instructions for recording text about the site and histology. Rationale Text is needed to justify the codes selected for the data items and to record information that is not coded at all. The text is used for quality control and special studies. Instructions a. Record a brief, but specific, description of the site of origin for the tumor being reported. Include laterality if applicable. Use standard abbreviations to conserve space if necessary and if each abbreviation has a clear meaning and only one interpretation. Example 1: Upper outer quadrant (UOQ) of right (RT) breast. Example 2: Splenic flexure of colon. b. Record a brief, but specific, description of the histologic type, behavior, and grade of the tumor being repor ted. Use standard abbreviations to conserve space if necessary and if each abbreviation has a clear meaning and only one interpretation. Example 1: Infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma (ca). Example 2: Moderately well differentiated (MWD) adenocarcino ma (adenoca) in adenomatous poorly differentiated (PD), nodular. Example 4: Superficial spreading melanoma. Example 5: Astrocytoma, stage III. Example 6: Adult T -cell leukemia. c. In the Description of Diagn osis or the RMCDS Dx Procedure Pathology field, record any additional pertinent information from cytology and histopathology reports. In RMCDS it is not necessary to repeat information recorded in the primary site and histology text fields. Include, as a pplicable: Date(s) of procedure(s) Type(s) of tissue specimen(s) Gross tumor size Extent of tumor spread Involvement of resection margins Information regarding lymph ovascular invasion (LVI) Number of lymph nodes involved and examined Differential diagnoses considered and any ruled out or favored. d. Facilities using paper abstracts to report should also attach copies of medical record documentation (such as pathology reports and operative reports) that identifies the site and histolog y information for the primary being reported. However, text describing the site and histology must be completed by all reporting facilities.

Note: Code this data item for cases diagnosed on or after January 01, 2016. For cases diagnosed January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2015, code tumor size using CS Tumor Size. Codes 000 No mass or tumor found; e.g., a tumor of a stated primary site is not fo und, but the tumor has metastasized. 001 1 mm or described as less than 1 mm 002-988 Exact size in millimeters (2 mm to 988 mm) 989 989 millimeters or larger 990 Microscopic focus or foci only and no size is given. 998 Tumor involvement of specified esopha geal, stomach, colorectal, lung and main stem bronchus, and breast primaries. See coding instructions. 999 Unknown; size not stated; not documented in the patient record; size of tumor cannot be assessed; not applicable. Priority Order for Recording Tumo r Size a. Record the size measured on the surgical resection specimen, when surgery is performed as the first definitive treatment. No pre -surgical treatment has been given. b. If neoadjuvant therapy was given before surgery, do not record the size of th e pathologic specimen. Code the largest size of the tumor documented prior to neoadjuvant therapy. If size is unknown, record code 999. c. If there's no surgical resection of the primary tumor, record the largest measurement of the tumor from documentat ion of physical exam, imaging, or other diagnostic procedures performed prior to any other form of treatment. d. If a, b, and c above do not apply, record the largest size from all information available within four months of the date of diagnosis, in the absence of disease progression. Instructions a. Record the diameter of the tumor as tumor size, not the depth or thickness. b. Record the size of the invasive component, if stated. (1) If both an in situ and an invasive component are present and the invasive component is stated, record the size of the invasive component even if it is smaller. (2) If the size of the invasive component is not stated, record the size of the entire tumor. c. For purely in situ tumors, record the size as stated. d. Code the size of the primary tumor, rather than the size of the specimen, polyp, ulcer, cyst, or distant metastasis. However, if the tumor is described as a \"cystic mass,\" and only the size of the entire mass is stated, code the size of the entire mass, since the cysts are part of the tumor itself. e.

For example: Size of between 2 and 3 cm, code as 025 f. Rounding and Converting (1) If tumor size is greater than 1 millimeter and described in fractions of millimeters: Round tenths of mm in the 1 -4 range down to the near est whole millimeter (e.g., code 5.2 mm to 005), Round tenths of mm in the 5 -9 range up to the nearest whole millimeter (e.g., code 6.5 mm to 007). (2) If tumor size is described in centimeters, move the decimal one space to the right, converting the measurement to millimeters (e.g., code 1.5 cm to 015). g. Record the largest dimension or diameter of tumor, whether it is from an excisional biopsy specimen or the complete resection of the primary tumor. h. Disregard microscopic residual or positive surgi cal margins when coding tumor size. i. Discrepancies (1) If there are discrepancies among tumor size measurements in the various sections of the pathology report, code the size from the synoptic report (CAP protocol or pathology report checklist). If onl y a text report is available, use: final diagnosis, microscopic, or gross examination, in that order. (2) If there is a difference in reported tumor size among imaging and radiographic techniques, unless the physician specifies which imaging is most accura te, record the largest size in the record, regardless of which imaging technique reports it. j. Do not add the size of pieces or chips together to create a whole as they may not be from the same location, or they represent only a small portion of a large tumor. However, if the pathologist states an aggregate or composite size (determined by fitting the tumor pieces together and measuring the total size), record that size. If the only measurement describes pieces or chips, record tumor size as 999. k. If the tumor is multi -focal or if multiple tumors are reported as a single primary, code the size of the largest invasive tumor. If all of the tumors are in situ, code the size of the largest in situ tumor. l. Record 998 when the following terms describe t umor involvement in these specific sites: Esophagus (C15.0 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 121 Lung and main stem bronchus Diffuse, entire lung, or NOS (C34.0 - C34.9) Breast (C50.0 - C50.9) Diffuse m.

For numbers less than 10, enter a leading zero. Codes 00 All regional nodes examined are negative. 01-89 1-89 regional nodes are positive. Code exact number of nodes positive. 90 90 or more regional nodes are positive. 95 Positive aspiration or core b iopsy of regional lymph node(s) was performed. 97 Positive regional lymph nodes are documented, but the number is unspecified. 98 No regional nodes were examined. 99 It is unknown whether nodes are positive; not applicable; not stated in the patient record . Example: The pathology report reads 11 out of 17 nodes examined were found to contain metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Record 11 in the Regional Nodes Positive field. Instructions a. Record the total number of regional lymph nodes removed as part o f the first course of treatment, examined by the pathologist , and reported to contain cancer. The number of regional lymph nodes positive is cumulative from all procedures that removed lymph nodes through the completion of surgeries in the first course of treatment. Do not record positive distant lymph nodes removed as part of the first course of treatment. Do not code positive regional lymph nodes removed to establish recurrence or progression of disease. Do not code nodes assessed by clinical examination only and stated to be positive. b. Record the number positive regardless of whether the patient received preoperative treatment. c. Since true in situ cases cannot have positive lymph nodes, the only allowable codes are 00 (negative) or 98 (not examined) . Codes 01 -97 and 99 are not allowed for in situ cases. d.

Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 137 SUMMARY STAGE 20 18 NAACCR Item # 764 Description This is a required 1 -character field for recording a code that indicates the extent of cancer spread. Refer to the Summary Stag e 2018 (SS2018) Manual for complete guidelines on assigning Summary Stage to be coded in this field. The manual can be found at https://seer.cancer.gov/tools/ssm/ . For case diagnosed prior to 2018 : For cases diagnosed 01/01/2001 through 12/31/ 2003 and 01/01/ 2015 through 12/31/ 2017 use SEER Summary Staging Manual 2000. For cases diagnosed January 1, 2004 through 2015, Summary Stage is derived from the Collaborative Staging input . For cases diagnosed prior to 2001 , use SEER Summary Staging Guide , 1977 . Codes 0 In situ 1 Localized only 2 Regional by direct extension 3 Regional to lymph nodes only 4 Regional by direct extension and to lymph nodes (combination of codes 2 and 3) 7 Distant metastases/systemic disease 8 Benign/borderline (brain, CNS other, and intracranial gland only) 9 Unstaged, unknown, or unspecified Note: Code 5 (Regional, NOS) can no longer be coded for SS2018. Definitions and Rules a. Summary Stage of disease is a clinical judgment of the extent of cancer spread and should include all information available through completion of surgery(ies) in the first course of treatment or within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer. Stage does not change as the disease progresse s. Metastasis that is known to have developed after the original diagnosis was made should be excluded. b. For all sites, the extent of disease is based on pathologic, operative, and clinical assessment. If there is a discrepancy between the pathology r eport and the operative report, the priority for assessing extent of disease is based on pathologic, operative, then clinical findings, respectively. Gross observations at surgery are particularly important when not all malignant tissue is removed. If no surgery is performed, use all diagnostic or radiological evidence and therapeutic procedures available in the medical record to determine the Summary Stage, if enough information is provided. c. Autopsy reports are used in coding extent of disease by app lying the same rules for inclusion and exclusion. d. The terms used to describe tumor involvement are sometimes ambiguous. The SS2018 Manual General Coding Instructions lists terms that may be interpreted as tumor involvement or non - involvement. Instruc tions a. To determine the Summary Stage code, find the site-specific chapter in the SS2018 Manual for the applicable site and/or histology combination. Each such chapter is divided into general staging categories (localized, regional, and distant). (1) The \"Localized\" category lists the layers or parts of the primary organ. If the cancer is contained within these layers, it is considered localized (code 1). Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 138 (2) The \"Regional\" category is divided into \"Direct Extension\" an d \"Lymph Nodes\" subcategories. If the cancer has spread to any of the adjacent organs or sites listed in the Direct Extension subcategory, it is considered regional by direct extension (code 2). If the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes specified, it is considered reg ional to lymph nodes (code 3). If the cancer has spread to adjacent organs and to regional lymph nodes, use code 4, a combination of codes 2 and 3. (3) The \"Distant\" category lists the most common, but not all, sites of distant spread for each primary site. If the cancer has spread to an organ that is not directly touching the original primary organ, it is considered distant by direct extension or metastasis (code 7). Positive lymph nodes that are not in the region of the original primary site are considered di stant lymph nodes ( SS2018 code 7). Use the SS2018 Manual to determine if a lymph node is regional or distant. The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (the TNM coding book) is also a good reference to use when determining Summary Stage, even if you do not actually assign TNM codes. The AJCC manual often lists lymph nodes that are considered regional (vs. distant lymph nodes) and includes illustrations that may clarify the various layers of an organ (e.g., colon). b. Use code 8 for benign and borderline brain/CNS cases. c. Use code 9 (unstaged) for u nknown primaries (C80.9), even if the unknown primary has been diagnosed from a metastatic site. Example: A patient with an unknown primary site (C80.9) has metastases in the brain and liver. Although at least one of these sites has to be a metastatic site distant from the original primary (since brain and liver are not adjacent to each other), SS2018 should be coded 9 (unknown) . Metastatic sites for unknown primaries should be documented in the \"Mets at Diagnosis\" d ata items and the \"Substantiate Stage \" text item . d. Use code 9 i f the registry collects other benign/borderline tumors that are not reportable . Code 8 is allowed only for benign and borderline brain/CNS cases.

Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 142 SUBSTANTIATE STAGING RMCDS Item: Staging Description This is a required text field in the paper and RMCDS abstracts for recording a narrative description of information that substantiates the Summary Stage or the AJCC staging , as applicable. It is not sufficient to merely code the items. The information from the medical record supporting the codes must be recorded. Facilities using other types of registry software should follow their vendor's instructions for recor ding text that substantiates staging. Instructions a. Identify the specific evidence in the medical record that justifies the staging and record the evidence briefly , in this field. Standard abbreviations can be used to save space. It is not necessary t o repeat information documented in other text fields. Examples: Staging Text Summary Stage 4 Small cell carcinoma of the rt. lung with extension to the pericardium and mets to 3 of 4 hilar lymph nodes. Summary Stage 1 Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon with invasion through the muscularis propria. LN neg. Summary Stage 7 Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the rt. ovary with extension to the small intestine. Summary Stage 2 Diffuse, histiocytic malignant lymphoma of the cervical and mediastinal lymph node regions. Bone marrow free of disease. Tumor Size Summary : 005 5 mm melanoma, 1.2 mm thick, no ulceration, 20 neg. LN, Reg LN Pos: 00 remainder exam negative Reg LN Exam: 20 SSDI #3817 : 1.2 b. Use this field to clarify any coding that is vague (e.g., specific metastatic site coded as a \"9\") or to justify any coding that requires the coder to override an edit error message (e.g., metastatic site coding that is consistent with AJCC staging but inconsistent with Summary Stage). c. Document any unresolved discrepancies between physician and registry staging decisions. d. Facilities using the paper abstract to report should also attach copies of medical record documentation (such as the pathology and operati ve reports) that substantiates the extent of disease. However, text that substantiates the staging must be completed by all reporting facilities. Data Type: Text ACoS: N/A State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 143 AJCC TNM STAGING The TNM (Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis) staging items are required for State reporting only if available . Refer to the STORE manual and the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual , Eighth Edition for the codes and rules of classification for cases diagnosed 01/01/2018 and later . ACoS Requirements Hospitals with cancer programs approved by the American College of Surgeons (ACoS) must record pathologic al, or post therapy and/ or clinical classifications of TNM and stage group in order to meet ACoS approval standards. In October 1981, the Commission on Cancer resolved that the stag ing system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) would be used in all approved cancer programs. The AJCC developed its staging system for evaluating trends in the treatment and control of cancer. This staging is used by physicians to estimate prognosis, plan treatment, evaluate new types of therapy, analyze outcome, design follow -up strategies, and assess early detection results. In 1982, breast cancer was the first site implemented. Effective January 1991, ACoS required AJCC TNM staging for all required (analytic) cases that had a staging scheme in the AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer , Third Edition. The Commission has since published the fourth, fifth, sixth , seventh , and eighth editions of the manual. The effective dates for the various editions are listed below. AJCC Second Edition: Effective for cases diagnosed in 1988 or earlier . AJCC Third Edition: Effective for cases diagnosed from 1989 through 1992 . AJCC Fourth Edition: Effective for cases diagnosed from 1993 through 1997 . AJCC Fifth Edition: Effective for cases diagnosed from 1998 through 2002 . AJCC Sixth Edition: Effective for cases diagnosed in 2003 through 2009 . AJCC Seventh Edition: Effective for cases diagnosed 2010 and later. AJCC Eighth Edition: Effective for cases diagnosed 2018 and later. AJCC Staging System The TNM system for describing the extent of disease is based on the assessment of three anatomic factors (sometimes supplemented by nonanatomic factors) : T = The extent of the primary tumor N = The absence or presence and extent of regional lymph node metastasis M = The absence or presence of distant metastasis For each of the anatomic factors there is a set of categories (most often defined by a number) that is specific for the disea se site in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. Definitions a. Clinical (pretreatment) stage is based on information and evidence obtained before treatment. Symptoms, physical ex amination, imaging, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration (without resection) , and other relevant findings are the basis of clinical staging. Clinical stage of disease is assigned using all information available before initiation of definitive treatment , decision for watchful waiting, or within four months after the date of diagnosis, whichever is short est, as long as the cancer has not progressed during that time frame . The clinical stage is essential to select and evaluate therapy. b. Post therapy clinical stage is determined when the tumor has been microscopically sampled after neoadjuvant therapy or primary system/radiation therapy. c. Pathologic al stage is based on clinical stage information supplemented/modified by operative findin gs and pathological evaluation of the resected specimens. This classification is applicable when surgery is performed before initiation of adjuvant radiation or systemic therapy . Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 144 d. Post therapy pathological stage is determined after treatment for patien ts receiving systemic and/or radiation therapy alone or as a component of their initial treatment, or as neoadjuvant therapy before planned surgery.

Definitive (cancer -directed) treatment is any therapy whose purpose is to modify, control, remove, or destroy proliferating cancer tissue. Treatment may be directed toward either the primary or metastatic sites, regardless of the patient's response. Record all cancer -directed treatment administered to the patient in the first course of treatment. Include treatment provided in other facilities , palliative treatment, and failed treatments (the patient did not respond). For statistical ana lysis of treatment, only the following codes are considered definitive treatment codes: 10-90 Surgery (removal of tumor cells) 20-98 Regional radiation treatment modality (destruction of cancer cells through rays, radons) 01-03 Chemotherapy (destruction o f cancer cells through chemicals, drugs) 01 Hormone/steroid (endocrine) therapy (changing hormonal balance through hormones, steroids, or endocrine surgery) 01 Immunotherapy or Biological Response Modifier therapy (agents that alter the immune system or ch ange the host response) 10-40 Hematologic transplant and endocrine procedures 1-3 Other cancer -directed therapy (nonspecific or experimental) Codes that indicate a specific definitive treatment is not recommended, recommended but not given, or unknown wh ether recommended or given may be recorded in the treatment fields listed below. (1) Chemotherapy codes 82 -99 (2) Hormone Therapy codes 82 -99 (3) Immunotherapy (Biological Response Modifier) codes 82 -99 (4) Other Therapy codes 7, 8, and 9 (5) Hematologic Transplant and Endocrine Procedure codes 82 -99 b. Non-definitive (non cancer -directed) treatments are performed to establish a diagnosis or stage, relieve symptoms, prolong the patient's life, or prepare the patient for cancer -directed therapy . Such treatments are not considered cancer -directed treatment. There is no expectation of reducing the size of the tumor or of delaying the spread of the disease. In effect, it is treatment of the patient, not the cancer. The following examples of non -definitive treatment are not considered cancer -directed therapy, but can be recorded in the designated fields, when applicable. (1) Surgical Diagnostic and Staging Procedure codes 01 - 09. These procedures include: Incisional biopsies Exploratory proced ures with or without biopsies -otomy, -ostomy, or bypass only (2) Palliative care, such as pain management, that does not include surgery, radiation or systemic treatment. (Such care can be recorded in NAACCR data item #3270, using codes 1 -9. However, N AACCR data item #3270 is not collected by the State Cancer Registry - refer to the STORE .) The following treatments are also considered non -definitive therapies and are not coded: (1) Pain medication (2) Oxygen (3) Antibiotics administered for an associated infection (4) Transfusions (e.g., to counteract blood dyscrasia resulting from chemotherapy) (5) Medication (e.g., Epogen, Neupogen, or Procrit) to counteract blood dyscrasia resulting from chemotherapy (6) Intravenous therapy to maintain fluid or nutritional balance Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 147 (7) Laser therapy directed at relieving symptoms (8) Closure of colostomy in a patient with prior resection for cancer of the bowel (9) Megestrol acetate, hormone therapy designed to improve nutritional status c. First Course of Tre atment All cancer -directed therapies specified in the physician(s) treatment plan during or after the initial diagnosis are part of the first course of treatment. Documentation of a treatment plan may be found in several different sources, for example: medical clinic record, consultation reports, and outpatient records. The discharge plan may document all or part of the treatment plan. (1) For all malignancies except leukemias , first course of treatment includes all methods of therapy recorded in the t reatment plan and administered to the patient during or after the first diagnosis of cancer. Planned treatment may include multiple modes of therapy and may encompass intervals of a year or more. If the therapy is a part of an established protocol or ad ministered within accepted management guidelines for the disease, it is first course of treatment. When a treatment plan is not available or is unclear, consult the physician advisor. If there is no treatment plan, established protocol, or management gu idelines, and consultation with a physician advisor is not possible, use the principle: \"Initial treatment must begin within four months of the date of initial diagnosis.\" (2) For leukemias , first course of treatment includes all methods of therapy recor ded in the treatment plan and administered to the patient during or after the first diagnosis of leukemia. Record all remission -inducing or remission -maintaining cancer -directed therapy as first course of treatment. Treatment regimens may include multipl e modes of therapy and may encompass intervals of a year or more. Certain pediatric leukemia protocols span two years or more from induction to the end of maintenance. In these protocols, induction, consolidation, and maintenance are all first course of treatment. If the therapy for leukemia is a part of an established protocol or administered within accepted management guidelines for the disease, it is first course of treatment. When a treatment plan is not available or is unclear, consult the physici an advisor. A patient may relapse after achieving a first remission. All therapy administered after the relapse is secondary or subsequent treatment. d. No Treatment No therapy is a treatment option (the patient refused therapy, the family/guardian re fused therapy, the patient expired before therapy started, or the physician recommended no therapy). Therefore, first course of treatment may be no treatment. Record the date the decision was made not to treat in Date of First Course of Treatment . e. Treatment for Recurrence or Progression (subsequent treatment) includes all treatments administered after the first course of therapy is complete or was stopped. A physician may stop treatment if the disease progresses despite therapy or if the patient fail s to respond. The patient may also choose to stop treatment. If therapy is not part of the planned first course of treatment, it is considered subsequent therapy. If there is a change in the original planned or administered treatment because the patient does not respond or the disease progresses, such therapy should be excluded from the first course of therapy and be considered as part of a second or subsequent course of therapy. The State Cancer Registry does not require facilities to report su bsequent therapy. The RMCDS program includes \"Subsequent Treatment\" screens for facilities that choose to report it. Coding Instructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 148 f. Treatment Dates (1) If your software allows collection of information for only one cancer -directed surgery, record the first date on which the patient has cancer -directed surgery. Record the surgery code with the highest priority according to the rules defined in the Appendix G for site -specific surgery codes . (2) If the exact date that therapy was started is not known, the best estim ate based on available information is acceptable. In the absence of an exact date of treatment, the date of hospital admission for the first cancer -directed therapy is acceptable. Recording an approximate date is preferable to leaving the date blank . (3) If there is no basis for estimating, leave the month and day spaces blank . Every attempt should be made to enter the month and year, even if an estimate is necessary. In those rare instances when it is necessary to enter unknown month, day, or year, leave the appropriate spaces blank . If information is limited to a description, use the following: DESCRIPTIVE TERM USED DATE CODE Spring April The middle of the year July Fall October Winter Try to determine if this means the beginning of the year (January) or the end of the year (December). Code as indicated. (4) If cancer -directed therapy was initiated at another facility and you cannot approximate the date it began, leave the date blank . If you do know the exact date, you should record it, ev en if the therapy did not take place at your facility. (5) If the documented , planned first course of therapy occurred after four months, enter the date this planned first course of therapy was initiated, even if it was initiated after four months from th e date of initial diagnosis. (6) If class of case is 38 (diagnosed at autopsy), do not record any treatment or treatment dates. Date of First Course Treatment would be left blank .

Definitive (cancer -directed ) surgery is surgery that removes or destroys proliferating cancer tissue . This includes excisional biopsy with microscopic residual disease or no residual disease. Valid codes for cancer -directed surgery of the primary site are 10 -90. b. Non cancer -directed procedures are performed to diagnose or stage the disease ( Surgical Diagnostic and Staging Procedure codes 01 -07), or for relief of symptoms ( Palliative Care NAACCR item #3270 code 1). Record Surgical Diagnostic and Staging Procedures in the designated field of the RMCDS \"First Course of Treatment\" screens. The State Reg istry does not collect the Palliative Care item #3270. The following procedures are examples of exploratory (diagnostic or staging) surgery (code 03 without biopsy The following non cancer -directed procedures are examples of bypass surgery (code 04 without biopsy or code 06 with biopsy). Code only if performed as part of the initial diagnosis and work -up. If performed for palliat ion only, code in Palliative Care NAACCR item #3270 if collected. The State Registry does not collect the Required State Registry: Required Coding Ins tructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 158 The following examples of diagnostic (non cancer -directed) procedures are not considered exploratory surgery. These procedures do not require an incision, since entry into a body cavity is made through a natural orifice. Code only if a biopsy was done as part C) - Use non cancer -directed surgery code 02 when primary site is corpus u teri. Use the cancer -directed surgery code only when performed for in situ cancer of the cervix. Brushings, washings, aspiration of cells, and hematologic findings (peripheral blood smears) are not surgical procedures. Instructions a. After determining that cancer -directed surgery of the primary site was performed, use the best information in the operative and pathology reports to determine the operative procedure. The operative report title may not have adequate information for the surgery code. Use the operative report text and the pathology report to correctly identify the procedure performed. Use the information from the pathology report when an operative report is unclear or is inconsistent. Exception: If the pathology report states they cannot give an accurate accounting of organs removed (tumor encasement, crush artifact, etc). b. In the \"Surgery\" field, record the site -specific 2 -digit surgical code from Appendix G for the specific surgery performed as part of the first course of treat ment. For RMCDS users, record the date the surgery was performed in the adjacent \"Date\" field. c. Record Surgical Diagnostic and Staging Procedures in the designated field of the RMCDS \"First Course of Treatment\" screens. Do record all biopsies as well as cancer -directed surgical procedures. d. More than one cancer -directed surgical procedure can be recorded in the RMCDS \"First Course of Treatment\" screens. If a biopsy (excluding needle biopsy or any biopsy where the margins are not described in the p ath report) was followed by a re -excision or wide excision within the first course of cancer -directed therapy and the path report for the re -excision or wide excision is negative for residual tumor, code the biopsy as an excisional biopsy. In the RMCDS pr ogram or the paper abstract, record both procedures, each with its respective date. Record the excisional biopsy date as the date of first course of treatment. Example 1: A patient has an excisional breast biopsy at your hospital January 12, 2021 . The pathology report reveals an axillary node with micrometastasis. The patient opted to have a mastectomy on March 21, 2021 . Code the procedures as follows: Surgery Code Procedure Date 41 Simple mastectomy 03/21/ 2021 22 Excisional biopsy 01/12/2 021 If you can record only one surgical procedure in your system, record the surgical code with the highest priority according to the rules on the following page and use the first date on which the patient has cancer -directed surgery (41 -01/12/ 2021 ). Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 159 Example 2: A patient had a breast biopsy on March 15, 2021 in the physician's office. A simple mastectomy was done at your hospital on March 27, 2021 . Both procedures should be recorded, as follows: Surgery Code Procedure Date 41 Mastectomy 03/27/ 2021 02 Incisional biopsy of primary site 03/15/ 2021 If you can record only one surgical procedure in your system, code surgery 41 with 03/27/ 2021 as the date of treatment. e. If the patient had no surgery at your hospital, but had surgery at another facility, you may enter the surgery information from the other hospital, if known. In one of the RMCDS \"First Course Treatment\" screen(s), record the facility ID and the appropriate surgery code and date. In the paper abstract, identify the facility in the Description of Treatment text field. f. If the patient did not h ave cancer -directed surgery, record the reason as instructed in the Reason for No Surgery of Primary Site section. Special Rules a. Coding Multiple Definitive Surgeries (1) If a single field is available for the data item Surgical Procedure of Primary Site or if a summary treatment field is provided and the patient has multiple cancer -directed surgeries of the primary site, code the most invas ive, definitive surgery. For codes 00 through 79, the code positions are hierarchical. Last -listed codes take precedence over codes listed above. Use codes 80 and 90 only if more precise information about the surgery is unavailable. Example: A patient has a colonoscopy with removal of a polyp in the sigmoid colon (code 28). The pathology report identifies carcinoma extending into the stalk. A week later, the patient has a hemicolectomy (code 40). Code the hemicolectomy since it is the most invasive, definitive surgery. (2) If multiple fields are available to record consecutive surgical events, code each consecutive surgery of the primary site. For the example above, record both procedures, each with its respective date. Record the polypectomy date as the date of first course of treat ment. b. Coding Surgery for Multiple Primaries Code the appropriate surgery for each site when multiple primaries are excised at the same time. Example 1: A patient who has cancer of the cervix and of the endometrium enters your facility for a total abd ominal hysterectomy. Code a total abdominal hysterectomy for each of the two primaries. Example 2: A patient has colon and skin cancer. The patient had a hemicolectomy and a wide excision of the skin lesion. Code the colectomy for colon and the wide exc ision for skin. c. If a surgical procedure removes the remaining portion of an organ that had been partially resected previously for any condition, code as total removal of the organ. If none of the primary organ remains, the code should indicate that th is is the case. Example 1: Resection of a stomach that had been partially excised previously is coded as total removal of stomach. Example 2: Removal of a cervical stump is coded as total removal of uterus. Example 3: Lobectomy of a lung with a previous w edge resection is coded as total removal of lobe. d. Code 98 applies to specific tumors that cannot be clearly defined in terms of primary or non -primary site. Use code 98 for the for No Surgery of Primary Site must be coded to 1. Exception: For death certificate only cases, use code 99. Coding Ins tructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 160 e. For extra -lymphatic lymphoma, code surgery using the site -specific surgery coding scheme for the primary site (not the lymph node scheme). f. For RMCDS users: Record the date for Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery (excluding code 1) or Surgical Procedure/Other Site in one of the treatment screens. g. For facilities that collect Palliative Care NAACCR item #3270 : If the procedure coded in this item was provided to prolong a patient's life by controlling symptoms, to alleviate pain, or to make the patient more comfortable, then also record this surgery in the Palliative Care field. The State Registry does not collect the Palliative Care item #3270 . Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 161 DATE OF SURGERY FLAG NAACCR Item # 1201 Description This flag explains why there is no appropriate value in the corresponding date field, Date of First Surgical Procedure (NAACCR Item #1200). This data item was added to Volume II Version 12 (effective January 2010). Rationale Prior to version 12 (through 2009 diagnosis), date fields included codes that provided information other than dates. As part of an initiative to standardize date fields, new fields were introduced to accommodate non-date information that had previously b een transmitted in da te fields. Codes 10 No information whatsoever can be inferred from this exceptional value. (It is unknown if any surgical procedure was performed.) 11 No valid date is applicable in this context (for example, no surgical procedure was performed). 12 A val id date is applicable but not known. (Surgery was performed but the date is unknown.) Blank A valid date is coded in item Date of First Surgical Procedure (NAACCR Item #1200). Instructions a. Leave this item blank if Date of First Surgical Procedure (NAA CCR Item #1200) has a full or partial date recorded. b. Use code 12 if the Date of First Surgical Procedure cannot be determined, but the patient did receive first course surgery. c. Use code 10 if it is unknown whether any surgery was performed. d. Use co de 11 if the no surgical procedure was performed. e. Code this data item (when appropriate) even if your software uses the traditional format for date entry.

Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Ins tructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 162 SCOPE OF REGIONAL LYMPH NODE SURGERY NAACCR Item # 1292 Description This item identifies the removal, biopsy, or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) at the time of surgery of the primary site or during a separate surgical event. The item can be used to compare and evaluate the extent of surgical treatment. Codes 0 None 1 Biopsy o r aspiration of regional lymph node (s) 2 Sentinel lymph node biopsy (only) 3 Number of regional nodes removed unknown or not stated; regional lymph nodes removed, NOS 4 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes removed 5 4 or more regional lymph nodes removed 6 Sentinel node biopsy and procedures that would be coded 3, 4, or 5 performed at the same time, or timing not stated 7 Sentinel node biopsy and procedures that would be coded 3, 4, or 5 performed at different times 9 Unknown or not applicable Use the opera tive report as the primary source document to determine whether the operative procedure was a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx), or a more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes, or a combination of both SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection. Re view both the surgeon's planned procedure as well as the description of the procedure that was actually performed. The operative report takes precedence over the pathology report for distinguishing between SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection or a com bination of these two procedures. Do not use the number of lymph nodes removed and pathologically examined as the sole means of distinguishing between a SLNBx and a regional lymph node dissection. Definitions Code Definition 0 No regional lymph node surgery. No lymph nodes found in the pathologic specimen. Diagnosed at autopsy. 1 Biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) regardless of the extent of involvement of disease. Note s: If additional procedures were performed on the lymph nodes, use the appropriate code 2-7. For breast, biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) is uncommon. Confirm that the procedure was not actually a sentinel lymph biopsy. 2 Biopsy of the first lymph node or nodes that drain a defined area of tissue within the body. Sentinel node(s) are identified by the injection of a dye , radio -label , or a combination at the site of the primary tumor. Note s: Additional non -sentinel nodes can be taken during the same operative procedure. The additional nodes may be discovered by the pathologist or selectively removed (harvested) as part of the SLNBx procedure by the surgeon. If the operative report confirms that a regional lymph node dissection followed the SLNBx, use code 6. 3 Sampling or dissection of regional l ymph node(s) and the number of nodes removed is unknown or not stated. The procedure is not specified as sentinel node biopsy. 4 Sampling or dissection of regional lymph node(s) with fewer than four lymp h nodes found in the specimen. Note: Code 4 should be used infrequently. Ensure that t he procedure is not specified as SLNBx in the operative report . Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 163 Code Definition 5 Sampling or dissection of four or more regional lymph nodes. Notes: If relatively few nodes were examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm the procedure was not a SLNBx only (code 2). If a relatively large number of nodes was examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm that there was not a SLNBx i n addition to a more extensive regional lymph node dissection during the same, or separate, procedure (code 6 or 7). 6 SLNBx and procedures that would be coded 3, 4, or 5 performed at the same time, or timing not stated. Notes: Generally, SLNBx followed b y a regional lymph node completion will yield a relatively large number of nodes. However, it is possible for these procedure s to harvest only a few nodes. If relatively few nodes were examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm the p rocedure was not a SLNBx only (code 2). If a SLNBx is attempted and the patient fails to map (no sentinel lymph nodes are identified by the dye and/or radio -label injection) and the surgeon performs a more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes, use code 6. 7 SNLBx and regional lymph node dissection (code 3, 4, or 5) in separate surgical events. Note s: Generally, SLNBx followed by a regional lymph node completion will yield a relatively large number of nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to harvest only a few nodes. If relatively few nodes were examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm the procedure was not a SLNBx only (code 2). 9 It is unknown whether regional lymph node surgery was performed; death cer tificate -only; for lymphomas with a lymph node primary site; an unknown or ill -defined primary; or for hematopoietic, reticuloendothelial, immunoproliferative, or myeloproliferative disease. Instructions a. Record t he scope of regional lymph node surge ry for each surgical event even if no surgery of the primary site was performed. b. Record surgical procedures that aspirate, biopsy, or remove regional lymph nodes in an effort to diagnose or stage disease in this data item. Record the date of this surgical procedure in data item Date of First Course Treatment and/or Date of First Surgi cal Procedure as appropriate. c. Codes 0 -7 are hierarchical. If only one procedure can be recorded, code the procedure that is numerically higher. d. If two or more surgical procedures of regional lymph nodes are performed, the code for each subsequent procedure must include the cumulative effect of all preceding procedures. For example, a sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by a regional lymph node dissection at a later time is coded 7. e. Code the removal of regional nodes for both primaries when the patient two primaries with common regional lymph nodes. f. Use code 9 for the following: Any Schema g. Do not code distant lymph nodes removed during surgery to the primary site for this data item. Distant nodes are coded in the data field Surgical Procedure/Other Site . h.

It shou ld be clearly described as conformal or 3 -D therapy. 05 Intensity modulated therapy An external beam planning technique where the shape or energy of beams is optimized using software algorithms. Any external beam modality can be modulated but these generally refer to photon or proton beams. Intensity modulated therapy can be described as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), intensity modulated x -ray or proton therapy (IMXT/IMPT), volumetric arc therapy (VMAT), and other ways. If a treatmen t is described as IMRT with online re - optimization/re -planning, then it should be categorized as online re-optimization or re -planning. 06 Stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery techn iques, but the treatment is not described as Cyberknife \u00ae or Gamma Knife \u00ae. These approaches are sometimes described as SBRT (stereotactic body radiation), or SRT (stereotactic radiotherapy). If the treatment is described as robotic radiotherapy (e.g., Cy berknife \u00ae) or Gamma Kn ife\u00ae, use stereotactic radiotherapy a treatment is described as stereotactic radiotherapy of radiosurgery with online re -optimization/re -planning, then it should be categorized as online re -optimization or re -plann ing. 07 Stereotactic radiotherapy or Treatment using otherapy/radiosurgery 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Ins tructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 172 radiosurgery, robotic techniques, which is specifically described as robotic (e.g., Cyberknife \u00ae). 08 Stereotactic radiotherapy or radiosurgery, Gamma Knife \u00ae Treatment planning using stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery techniques which uses a Cobalt -60 gamma ray source and is specifically described as Gama Knife \u00ae. This is most commonly used for treatments in the brain. 09 CT-guided online adaptive therapy An external beam technique in which the treatment plan is adapted over the course of radiation to reflect changes in the patient's tum or or normal anatomy radiation using a CT scan obtained at the treatment machine (online ). These approaches are sometimes described as CT -guided online re -optimization or online re -planning. If a treatment is described as both CT - guided online adaptive therapy, as well as another external beam technique (IMRT, SBRT, etc.), then it should be categoried as CT -guided online adaptive therapy. If a treatment is described as \"adaptive\" but does not include the descriptor \"online, this code should not be used. 10 MR-guided online adaptive therapy An external beam technique in which the treatment plan is adapted over the course of radiation to reflect changes in the patient's tumor or normal anatomy radiation using an MRI scan obtained at the treatment machine (online). these approaches are sometimes described as MR -guided online re -optimization or online re -planning. If a treatment technique is described as both MR -guided online adaptive therapy as well as another external beam technique (IMRT, SBRT, etc.), then it should be categorized as MR -guided online therapy.

If chemotherapy was not administered, this item records the reason it was not administered to the patient. Chemotherapy consists of a group of anticancer drugs that inhibit the reproduction of cancer cells by interfering with DNA synthesis and mitosis. Reco rd chemotherapy administered at your facility, as well as chemotherapy given at any other facilities, if known. Codes 00 None, chemotherapy was not part of the planned first course of therapy ; diagnosed at autopsy. 01 Chemotherapy administered as first co urse therapy, but the type and number of agents is not documented in the patient record. 02 Single -agent chemotherapy administered as first course therapy. 03 Multiagent chemotherapy administered as first course therapy. 82 Chemotherapy was not recommended /administered because it was contraindicated due to patient risk factor s (e.g., comorbid conditions, advanced age , progression of tumor prior to administration, etc.). 85 Chemotherapy was not administered because the patient died prior to planned or recomm ended therapy. 86 Chemotherapy was not administered. It was recommended by the patient's physician, but was not administered as part of the first course of therapy. No reason was stated in the patient record. 87 Chemotherapy was not administered. It was recomme nded by the patient's physician, but this treatment was refused by the patient, a patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refusal was noted in the patient record. 88 Chemotherapy was recommended, but it is unknown if it was administered. 99 It is unknown whether a chemot herapeutic agent(s) was recommended or administered because it is not stated in the patient record. Death certificate only. Instructions a. Select the code for the type of chemotherapy that the patient received as part of the first course of treatment , even if it is palliative . Record chemotherapy as cancer -directed therapy when it is delivered concurrently or as adjuvant treatment . (1) Use code 00 if chemotherapy was not administered to the patient, and it is known that it is not usually administered f or this type and stage of cancer. (2) Use code 00 if the treatment plan offered multiple alternative treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not include chemotherapy. (3) Use code 00 if the option of , \"no treatment ,\" was accepted by the patient. (4) Code chemoemoblization as 01, 02, or 03 depending on the number of chemotherapeutic agents used. (5) If it is known that chemotherapy is usually administered for this type and stage of cancer, but was not administered to the pa tient, use code 82, 85, 86, or 87 to record the r eason it was not administered. (6) Use c ode 87 if the patient refused recommended chemotherapy, made a blanket refusal of all recommended treatment, or refused all treatment before any was recommended. (7) Use code 88 if it is known that a physician recommended the patie nt receive chemotherapy, but no further documentation is available yet to confirm its administration. (8) Use code 88 to indicate referral was made medical oncologist and the registry must fol low to determine whether it was given. If follow -up with the specific specialist or facility indicates the patien t was never there, use code 00. Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 179 (9) Use c ode 99 if it is not known whether chemotherapy is usually administered for this type and stage of can cer and there is no mention in the patient record whether it was recommended or administered. (10) If chemotherapy was provided as a radiosensitizer or radioprotectant, do not code as chemotherapy treatment. Chemotherapy intended for radiosensitization or radioprotection is given in low doses that do not affect the cancer. (11) If a chemotherapy drug is given for a reason other than cancer -directed treatment, do not code the drug as chemotherapy. If in doubt whether the chemotherapy drug is given to allev iate a symptom and not for cancer -directed treatment, consult your oncologist or oncology nurse. (12) For facilities that collect Palliative Care : If chemotherapy was provided to prolong a patient's life by controlling symptoms, to alleviate pain, or to m ake the patient more comfortable, then also record the chemotherapy provided in the Palliative Care NAACCR item #3270 . The State Registry does not collect the Palliative Care item #3270 . b. In the Chemotherapy field, enter the code from the list above for the chemotherapy that the patient received. For RMCDS users, record the date the course of chemotherapy was started in the adjacent \"Date\" field. Example: Single agent chemotherapy 5 -FU was started on July 1 5, 2021 at a physician's office as part of the first course of treatment. The treatment would be entered as follows: Chemotherapy code 02, Date: 07/15/ 2021 . c. One planned course of chemotherapy may be given in several segments. These segments are recorded as one course. The date listed for that course of chemotherapy should be the date the first segment of that course began. d. Two or more single agents given at separate times during the first course of cancer -directed therapy are considered a combination regimen and coded 03 (chemotherapy, multiple agents). If two or more single agents are given at different times after the fir st course, it is subsequent treatment and can be recorded in the \"Subsequent Treatment\" RMCDS screens. The State Registry does not collect subsequent treatment. Chemotherapy Information and Definitions a. Refer to the SEER *Rx Interactive Drug Database (http://seer.cancer.gov/) to determine whether the drugs used are classified as chemotherapeutic agents . b. Chemotherapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous infusion or given orally. Other methods of administration include: Intrathecal. Adminis tered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid through a lumbar puncture needle into an implanted access device (Ommaya reservoir). Pleural/pericardial. Injected directly into pleural or pericardial space to control malignant effusions. Intraperitoneal. Injected into the peritoneal cavity. Hepatic artery. Injected into a catheter inserted into the artery that supplies blood to the liver. c. Chemotherapy agents may be administered singly or in a combination regimen of two or more chemotherapy drugs. They a re administered in treatment cycles. The time span of a treatment cycle varies. It is dependent upon the histology, stage of disease, and treatment modalities. Chemotherapy may be administered for several weeks or several years. d. Clarification of ter ms: (1) Concurrent chemotherapy (multimodality therapy, combined modality therapy) is given before, during, or after other treatment modalities (surgery, radiation, etc.) as part of the treatment plan. (2) Adjuvant chemotherapy is given after other methods have destroyed the clinically detectable cancer cells. Chemotherapy is given to destroy micrometastases (undetectable cancer cells). The intent is to prevent or delay a recurrence. Coding Ins tructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 180 Example: A patient has breast cancer with positive nodes. All detectable tumor is removed by a modified radical mastectomy. The patient receives adjuvant chemotherapy to destroy any micrometastasis that may be present. The chemotherapy is given to delay or prevent a recurrence. (3) Neoadjuvant therapy is given prio r to surgical resection or radiation therapy to reduce the bulk of a locally advanced primary cancer. Example: A patient with locally advanced breast cancer receives chemotherapy to reduce tumor size. Chemotherapy is followed by a modified radical mastec tomy. (4) Chemoembolization is a procedure in which the blood supply to the tumor is blocked surgically or mechanically and anticancer drugs are administered directly into the tumor. Code as Chemotherapy when the embolizing agent(s) is a chemotherapeutic drug(s). Use SEER *Rx Interactive Drug Database (http:seer.cancer.gov/) to determine whether the drugs used are classified as chemotherapeutic agents. Example: A patient with primary liver cancer is treated using the following procedure: Under x -ray guidance, a small catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin and the catheter tip is threaded into the artery in the liver that supplies blood flow to the tumor. Chemotherapy is injected through the catheter into the tumor and mixed with particles that embolize or block the flow of blood to the tumor. (5) Ancillary drugs are medications whose actions are not directed at the patient's malignancy per se but that enhance the effects of the cancer -directed therapy. For example, ancillary drugs may modu late the actions of specific chemotherapeutic agents by increasing their effectiveness in destroying tumor cells or by decreasing the potential for specific side effects. Ancillary drugs are not to be coded as cancer -directed therapy. Example: Folinic ac id (leucovorin) stabilizes the drug -enzyme complex and thus increases the cytotoxic effects of 5 -FU and is frequently administered with 5 -FU for this purpose. Use chemotherapy code 02 (single agent) for 5 -FU and leucovorin treatment. e. Chemotherapy is d ivided into the following classifications: Group Subgroup(s) Examples Alkylating agents and B leomycin Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 181 Group Subgroup(s) Targeted therapy A group of newer cancer drugs that act directly against abnormal proteins in cancer cells. f. If the patient has an adverse reaction, the physician may change one of the drugs in a combination regimen. If the replacement drug belongs to the same group as the original drug, there is no change in the regimen. Example: The physician documents a mult imodality treatment plan that includes a combination regimen of chemotherapy. Vinblastine is one of the drugs in the chemotherapy regimen. After two cycles of chemotherapy, the physician says the Vinblastine will be replaced with Vincristine and the chem otherapy will continue as planned. This is a continuation of the planned first course of therapy. If the replacement drug is in a different group than the original drug, it is subsequent therapy. Exception: Unless there is disease progression, neoadjuv ant chemotherapy and all subsequent planned first course of treatment would be recorded as first course, even if there is a change in chemotherapeutic agents and/or groups. g. Code the six drugs listed below as BRM, beginning with January 1, 2013 diagnose s. Continue to code cases diagnosed prior to 01/01/2013 as chemotherapy.

Do not code as hormone therapy. Hormone replacement therapy used when tumor involvement or cancer -directed treatment has destroyed hormone -producing tissue. Do not code as hormone therapy. (4) For facilities that collect Palliative Care : If ho rmone therapy was provided to prolong a patient's life by controlling symptoms, to alleviate pain, or to make the patient more comfortable, then also record the hormone therapy provided in the Palliative Care NAACCR item #3270. The State Registry does not collect the Palliative Care item #3270. b. Record code 00 : (1) If hormone therapy was not administered to the patient, and it is known that it is not usually administered for this type and stage of cancer; (2) If the treatment plan offered multiple alternative treatment options, and the patient selected treatment that did not include hormone therapy; or (3) If the option of , \"no treatment ,\" was accepted by the patient. c. If it is known that hormone therapy is usually administered for this type and stage of cancer, but was not administered to the patient, use code 82, 85, 86, or 87 to record the reason it was not administered. d. Use c ode 87 if the patient refused recommended hormone therapy, made a blanket refusal of all recommended treatment, or refuse d all treatment before any was recommended. e. Use code 88 : (1) If it is known that a physician reco mmended hormone therapy, but no further documentation is available yet to confirm its administration; or (2) To indicate referral was made medical oncologist and the registry must follow to determine whether hormone therapy was given. If follow -up with the specific specialist or facility indicates the patien t was never there, use code 00. f. Use c ode 99 if it is not known whether hormone therapy is usually administered for this type and stage of cancer, and there is no mention in the patient record whether it wa s recommended or administered. g In the Hormone Therapy field, record 01 for hormone therapy. For RMCDS users, record the date the course of hormone therapy was started in the adjacent \"Date\" field. Example: Tamoxifen was started on July 15, 2021 .

These include bone marrow transplants, stem cell harvests, surgical and/or radiation endocrine therapy. If none of these procedures were administered, then use this field to record the reason they were not performed. Rationale This data item allows the evaluation of patterns of treatment that involve the alteration of the immune system or change the patient's response to tumor cells but does not involve the administration of anti - neoplastic agents. In addition, when evaluating the quality of care, it is useful to know the reason if these procedures were not performed. Codes 00 No trans plant procedure or endocrine therapy was administered as part of first course therapy; diagnosed at autopsy. 10 A bone marrow transplant procedure was administered, but the type was not specified. 11 Bone marrow transplant - autologous. 12 Bone marrow tran splant - allogeneic. 20 Stem cell harvest and infusion; u mbilical cord stem cell transplant with blood from one or multiple umbilical cords . 30 Endocrine surgery and/or endocrine radiation therapy. 40 Combination of endocrine surgery and/or radiation with a transplant procedure. (Combination of procedures code d as 30 and 10, 11, 12, or 20.) 82 Hematologic transplant and/or endocrine surgery/radiation was not recommended/administered because it was cont raindicated due to patient risk facto rs (e.g., comorbid conditions, advanced age, progression of disease prior to administration, etc. ). 85 Hematologic transplant and/or endocrine surgery/radiation was not administered because the patient died prior to pla nned or recommended therapy. 86 Hematologic transplant and/or endocrine surgery/radiation was not administered. It was recommended by the patient's physician, but was not administered as part of the first course of therapy. No reason was stated in the pa tient record. 87 Hematologic transplant and/or endocrine surgery/radiation was not administered. It was recommended by the patient's physician, but this treatment was refused by the patient, a patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refus al was noted in the patient record. 88 Hematologic transplant and/or endocrine surgery/radiation was recommended, but it is unknown if it was administered. 99 It is unknown whether hematologic transplant and/or endocrine surgery/radiation was recommended o r administered because it is not stated in the patient record. Death certificate only. Definitions a. Bone marrow transplant (BMT) : A procedure used to restore stem cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy and/or radiation. Autologous BMT : \"Auto\" mean s \"self.\" Stem cells are removed from the patient before high -dose chemotherapy or radiation treatment is administered . After these treatments are done, the patient's own stem cells are reinfused to restore the destroyed cells . Allogeneic BMT : \"Allo\" means \"other.\" Stem cells are removed from another person, called a donor. Most times, the donor must have the same genetic makeup as the patient, so that their blood is a \"match. \" A relative may be a good ma tch or d onors who are not related to the patient may be found through national bone marrow registries. Bone marrow transplanted from an identical twin ( syngeneic BMT ) is coded as 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 199 b. Stem cell harvests involve the collection of immature blood cells from the patient and th e reintroduction by transfusion of the harvested cells following chemotherapy or radiation therapy. c. Endocrine irradiation and/or endocrine surgery are procedures that suppress the naturally occurring hormonal activity of the patient and thus alter or affect the long -term control of the cancer's growth. These procedures must be bilateral to qualify as endocrine surgery or endocrine radiation. If only one gland is intact at the start of treatment, surgery and/or radiation to that remaining gland qualifi es as endocrine surgery or endocrine radiation. Instructions a. Select the code for the type of procedure the patient received and determine the date it was performed. (1) Use code 00 : If a transplant or endocrine procedure was not administered to the patient and it is known that these procedures are not usually administered fo r this type and stage of can cer; If the treatment plan offered multiple alternative treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not include a transplant or endocrine procedure ; or If the option of , \"no treatment ,\" was accepted by the patient . (2) Use code 10 if the patient has \"mixed chimera transplant\" (mini -transplant or non -myeloablative transplant). These transplants are a mixture of the patient's cells and donor cells. (3) Use code 20 if the patient has a stem cell harvest followed by a rescue or reinfusion (stem cell transplant, including allogenic stem cell transplant) as first course t herapy. If the patient does not have a rescue, code the stem cell harvest as 88, recommended, unknown if administered. (4) If it is known that a transplant or endocrine procedure is usually administered for this type and stage of cancer, but was not admi nistered to the patient, use code 82, 85, 86, or 87 to record the reason it was not administered. (5) Use c ode 87 if the patient refused a recommended transplant or endocrine procedure, or made a blanket refusal of all recommended treatment, or refused al l treatment before any was recommended. (6) Use code 88: If it is known that a physician recommended transplant or endocrine procedure, but no further documentation is available yet to confirm its administration; If a bone marrow or stem cell harvest was undertaken, but was not followed by a rescue or re - infusion as part of first course treatment; or To indicate referral was made to a specialist for hematologic transplant or endocrine procedures and the registry must follow the case . If follow -up with the specific specialist or facility indicates the patie nt was never there, use code 00. (7) Use c ode 99 if it is not known whether a transplant or endocrine procedure is usually administered for this type and stage of cancer and there is no mention in the patient record whether is was recommended or administered. b. In the Hematologic Transplant and Endocrine Procedure field, enter the code from the list above for the procedure that the patient received. For RMCDS users, record the date the procedure was performed in the adjacent \"Date\" field. For facilities that collect Palliative Care : If the hematologic transplant or endocrine procedure coded in this item was provided to prolong a patient's life by controlling symptoms, to alleviate pain, or to make t he patient more comfortable, then also record the procedure provided in the Palliative Care NAACCR item #3270.

If the patient is dead, this field records the date of death. Determine whether your software vendor uses the traditional format for date entry (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (C CYYMMDD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. Definition This date may be the discharge date, date of death, date of a patient's visit to a doctor's office or clinic, or the date the patient was last contacted, whichever is the most recent. T his date must be the latest date in the record. For example, a treatment date cannot be later than the Date of Last Contact . Instructions a. If no information is known after the patient is discharged from your hospital, record the date of discharge or the date of the patient's last outpatient visit. When abstracting a case with more than one admission or clinic visit, make sure the date of last contact is the last clinic visit date or the last discharge date, or whatever the latest date is . b. If you are aware of a more recent date the patient was last alive after discharge (such as through correspondence or telephone contact), record the latest date of contact known. The date may be the date the patient was contacted by telephone or resp onded to a letter. Record the date of the actual patient contact. Do not use the date information was received in the mail, or the date information was requested from a patient, physician, or clinic. Do not record the date follow -up information was recorded on the abstract or follow -up card, or the date the case was entered into the computer. Note: Failure to find a patient on a list of dec eased individuals does not cons titute evidence that the patient is alive. Neither Vital Status nor Date of Last Co ntact or Death should be changed. c. If a patient has multiple primaries, all records should have the same date of last contact. If the State Cancer Registry receives information from more than one facility for the same patient, this field will be update d in each of the patient's records. The latest date of last contact or death will be recorded for all of the patient's tumors. d. Estimate the date of last contact when the exact date is not available.

Codes 12 A valid date is applicable but not known. (The date of last contact or death is unknown). Blank A valid date is coded in the Date of Last Contact or Death item. Instructions a. Leave this item blank if Date of Last Contact or Death has a full or partial date recorded. b. Use code 12 if the Date of Last Contact or Death cannot be determined. c. Code this data item (when appropriate) even if your software uses the traditional format for date entry. Examples: Description Date (Leave unknown portions blank .) Date of Last Contact Flag Full date known *01/08/ 2021 or 2021 /01/08 Blank * For date entry, your software may use the traditional format (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. The computer will store either in the interoperable format.

Use the most accurate information available. Codes 0 Dead 1 Alive Instructions a. If no follow -up information is ever received, code the patient's vital status on the date of his/her last discharge from the hospital. b. If a patient has multiple primaries, all records should have the same patient vital status. Do not change a patient's vital status at discharge unless new follow -up information is available. c. There is no code for \"unknown,\" since you must know at least whether the pati ent was alive or dead at the time he or she last left your facility. Note: Failure to find a patient on a list of dec eased individuals does not cons titute evidence that the patient is alive. Neither Vital Status nor Date of Last Contact or Death should be changed. Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Follow -up and Additional Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 207 CANCER STATUS (STATUS OF TUMOR) NAACCR Item # 1770 Description This is a required 1 -character field to record a code that indicates the presence or absence of clinical evidence of the patient's malignant of non -malignant tumor as of the Date of Last Contact (or Death) . Tumor status changes if the patient has a recurr ence or relapse. Codes 1 No evidence of this tumor 2 Evidence of this tumor 9 Unknown, indeterminate whether this tumor is present, not stated in the patient record Instructions a. Code the best available information concerning the tumor status of the p atient as of the date of last contact or death. b. Code tumor status independently for each primary tumor. If a patient has multiple primaries, each record could have a different tumor status. If the patient has evidence of the other primary tumor, but does not have evidence of this tumor, code 1, no evidence of this tumor. c. Code patients who have hematopoietic disease (e.g., leukemia) that is in remission as no evidence of this tumor (code 1). d. Official death certificates do not always record the presence of tumors. If the registry abstract indicates that the patient had a malignant or non -malignant tumor immediately before death, code evidence of this tumor (code 2). Consult the registry physician advisor when questions arise. Decisions on tumo r status coding can be based on information such as: How much time elapsed between the last follow -up and patient's death? Was the last follow -up and tumor status information from a medical source (physician, hospital admission)? Are autopsy findings available to the registry? Example: A prostate cancer patient has a two -year history of metastatic disease. The patient had a bone scan at your facility in April 2021 . The urologist's diagnosis was progressive bony metastases and the bone scan confirmed extensive bone destruction. The registrar finds an obituary documenting the patient's death in a nursing home in June 2021 . Record the tumor status as \"evidence of this tumor\" (code 2).

Codes Code Label Definition 0 Reported hospitalization Hospital at another institution/hospital or first admission to the reporting facility. 1 Readmission Hospitalization or outpatient visit at the reporting facility. 2 Physician Information from a physician. 3 Patient Direct contact with the patient. 4 Department of Motor Vehicles The Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed the patient has a current license. 5 Medicare/Medicaid file The Medicare or Medicaid office confirmed the patient is alive. 7 Death certificate Information from the death certificate only. 8 Other Friends, relatives, employers, other registries, or any sources not covered by other codes. 9 Unknown/ not stated in patient record. The follow -up source is unknown or not stated in the patient record. Chapter 5 Follow -up and Additional Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 209 CAUSE OF DEATH NAACCR Item # 1910 Description This is a required 4-character field in the RMCDS abstract screen to record the ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision) code for the underlying cause of death. Record the cause of death listed on the death certificate. Central (state) registries are the primary users of this data item. Use the underlying cause of death ( ICD-10 code), even if believed to be in error. All underlying causes of death should be l eft-justified. The decimal point is assumed to be between the third and fourth digit, but should not be entered. Special Codes 0000 Patient alive at last follow -up 7777 State death certificate or listing not available 7797 State death certificate or list ing available, but underlying cause of death not coded; or the coded underlying cause of death is not available Instructions a. For all cases not meeting one of the above code descriptions and where the patient has died and the cause of death is known, record the ICD-10 underlying cause of death code. b. Use code 7777 when the patient has died, but the death certificate is not available. Hospitals would almost always record code 7777 for cause of death. c. Use code 7797 when the patient has died, but the coded underlying cause of death is not available. d. Some codes have an optional fifth digit. The fifth digit is not used in coding cause of death. e. The ICD-10-CM code for cause of death obtained from the medical record should not be used for the underlying cause of death code if no death certificate is available. Use only the ICD-10 code from the death certificate. If h ospitals record cause of death from the medical record for their own use, the State Registry will replace it with the death certificate code. f.

Facilities using other types of registry software should follow their vendor's instructions for recording text. Rationale Text is needed to justify the codes selected for the data items and to record information that is not coded at all. The text is used for quality control and special studies. Instructions The foll owing kinds of information may be recorded in this field: a. History of symptoms b. Clinical findings Example 1: Mass noted in right (rt.) breast 2 months ago; mammogram prior to admission (PTA) suspicious. Physical exam (PE) revealed 2 cm. mass in the upper outer quadrant (UOQ) of the right breast. No axillary lymphadenopathy noted. Example 2: Pleural effusion or ascites, weight loss, etc. c. Diagnostic and metastatic work -up (type of procedures, dates, and results) (1) Record only work -up related to the malignancy and the spread of the disease.

Data Type: Text ACoS: N/A State Registry: Optional Chapter 5 Follow -up and Additional Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 213 CENTRAL TUMOR REGISTRY NUMBER Leave this item blank. NAACCR Item # 20 Description This is an 8-character field (when combined with sequence number). The Central Tumor Registry (CTR) Number is an internal number that will be assigned and used by the State Cancer Registry only. In the RMCDS program, it appears in the abstract screen and on reports as CTR # (Central Tumor Registry Number). There is a unique CTR number for each person in the central registry. If a person has more than one primary tumor, the sequence number will distinguish one tumor from the next. In hospitals using the RMCDS prog ram, the CTR number that appears in the hospital's abstract screen is the same as the hospital registry's accession number for the patient. The first four digits are the accession year (YYYY). The next five digits are the accession number (#####). The l ast two digits are the sequence number (SQ), so that the number looks like this: YYYY#####SQ. When the hospital submits cases on diskette to the State Registry, the CTR number is automatically changed to the unique CTR number used by the central registry . Hospital accession numbers are also maintained in the central registry. Item Length: 6 + 2 Data Type: Numeric (FOR STATE USE ONLY) Coding Instructions Follow -up and Additional Data Chapter 5 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 214 DATE CASE REPORT RECEIVED (STAMP DATE) NAACCR Item # 2111 Description This is an 8 -character field for the date the electronic or paper abstract (or source record) is received by the State Cancer Registry for the respective tumor. If multiple reports are received from two or more sources, the applicable date for each report ing source is maintained in the State record for the tumor. The item label is Stamp Date in the State RMCDS screens. RMCDS screens for hospitals do not include this item. Rationale This item is used to assess and monitor the timeliness of reporting. Timeliness of abstracting (and reporting) is a concern for all standard -setting organizations and consequently, timeliness standard s have been established. This item can be used with the Date of First Contact to measure timeliness of reporting by individual facilities to the State Registry.Item Length: 8 Data Type: Numeric (FOR STATE USE ONLY) 215 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry CHAPTER 6: CORRECTIONS AND FOLLOW -UP OVERVIEW This chapter describes how corrections, deletions, and follow -up information on previously submitted cases are reported to the State Cancer Registry. Part I explains the purpose for corrections and follow - up; who submits reports; and when, how, and where reports are submitted. Par t II describes various methods to accomplish follow -up. Part III details how to complete the Correction and Follow -up Form. Part IV explains how to complete the Correction form for Multiple Patients . Forms are available upon request from the State Cance r Registry. PART I: GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS A. Purpose 1. Corrections The latest or most complete information and conclusions about a case should be reported. Over time, documentation may be added to a patient's medical record that was not available when an abstract was originally completed. Such information may, in the interest of accuracy, require modification of the originally reported data. For example, early diagnostic information may support a diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer. Later it may be learned that the original site of disease was breast cancer. In another case, more extensive work -up may reveal that disease originally thought to be malignant is benign and the case should be deleted from the State Cancer Registry database. For such cas es it is important to correct the primary site, histology, and/or extent of disease as information becomes more complete. There is no time limit for making revisions that give better information about the original diagnosis or stage. Note: This does not mean that as the disease progresses, the stage should be changed according to the latest stage of disease. Staging should reflect only information available through completion of surgery(ies) in the first course of treatment or within four months of diag nosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer. 2. Follow -Up Systematic, annual follow -up of cancer patients is an important function of the cancer registry. Annual follow -up achieves two important objectives: To encourage continued med ical surveillance of patients for early detection and treatment of recurrences and subsequent cancer; To obtain information for patient care studies and survival. Additional benefits of hospital -based follow -up efforts include provision of follow -up servi ce to physicians and enhanced public relations resulting from the hospital's continued concern for patient welfare. From an epidemiologic perspective, a statewide follow -up effort permits tracking of patients in the event that case control studies are required or patient contact is necessary to assess public health risks. The American College of Surgeons, Commission on Cancer requires a specified successful follow -up rate for all cancer programs seeking approval. B. Who Submits Correction and Follow -Up Reports Any hospital having correction or follow -up information about a patient who was previously reported to the State Cancer Registry may submit information on that patient to the State Cancer Registry. Corrections And Follow -up Chapter 6 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 216 C. When to Submit Corrections and Follow -Up In formation 1. Corrections Corrections or modifications to previously submitted data should be completed and submitted to the State Cancer Registry as soon as possible after the need for correction is discovered. 2. Follow -Up Follow -up should be perform ed at least annually for each patient, usually on the anniversary of the date of last contact. Follow -up reports may be submitted to the State Registry at least quarterly, particularly for hospitals that treat a large number of cancer patients. Hospital s are encouraged to submit updated information more frequently in order to maintain a complete record of the patient's treatment and a current database for analytic purposes. This permits an orderly workflow at both the State Cancer Registry and the repor ting hospital. D. How to Report Corrections and Follow -Up Information Corrections, deletions, and follow -up can be submitted in a number of different ways that are outlined below. 1. Copies of the Original Paper Abstract If your hospital reports by pap er abstract, changes or follow -up may be submitted on a copy of the original paper abstract. a. Make a copy of the original form. b. In red, write \"Correction,\" \"Delete,\" or \"Follow -Up\" at the top of the form. c. In red, cross out the original data in the field to be corrected and write the corrected or follow - up information beside the old. 2. Correct ion and Follow -Up Form Changes and/or follow -up may be submitted on a \"Correction and Follow -Up Form,\" explained in Part III of this chapter. a. Complete all identifying information on the form to ensure the appropriate case is corrected, deleted, or updated. b. Complete section D. \"Corrections\" or section F. \"Follow -Up Information,\" as applicable. c. Make a legible copy of the original form and mail the c opy to the State Cancer Registry, keeping the original at your hospital. 3. Corrections for Multiple Patients Corrections for multiple patients, such as those identified on a discrepancy report from the State Cancer Registry, may be submitted by one of t he following two methods: a. Write the correct information next to the error message on the discrepancy report and return the corrected report to the State Registry; or b. Record the corrections on the \"Correction Form for Multiple Patients\" explained in P art IV of this chapter. 4. Corrections by Telephone Changes may be submitted by calling the State Cancer Registry at (317) 233 -7158 with the correction or deletion. Changes of this type should be limited to five patients or less. Be prepared to identif y the case by patient name, sequence number, and possibly date of birth or Social Security Number so that State Registry staff can change the correct record. 5. Computerized Registries Follow -Up and Recurrence When the State Registry processes disks rec eived from hospitals with computerized registries, the most current follow -up information is automatically entered into the computer from the Chapter 6 Corrections and Follow -up Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 217 diskettes. This includes date of last contact or death, patient's vital status, and cause of death, if applicable . Other Changes (Corrections or Deletions) All other information the hospital may have changed, updated, or corrected in any previously reported case is NOT automatically updated in the computer when the disks are processed. These changes must be repor ted manually, in writing, or verbally. The information will not be automatically updated in order to prevent writing over data that had been previously corrected or consolidated by State Registry staff. The system at the State Registry is designed so th at when reports for a single case are received from multiple hospitals and there are significant differences in the information reported, they are not permitted to write over each other or merge until State Registry staff have analyzed and researched the d ifferences and determined the best information and/or codes. The cases are then manually changed and consolidated. The work of the State Registry staff would be lost if new information from one of the hospitals could write over any changes made in the co nsolidation process. The consolidation process is described in more detail in Chapter 7 of this manual. E. Where to Send Correction and Follow -Up Reports Envelopes should be carefully sealed and labeled \"CONFIDENTIAL MEDICAL INFORMATION.\" The envelope should be clearly addressed: Indiana State Cancer Registry Indiana Department of Health 2 North Meridian Street, Section 6-B Indianapolis, IN 46204 -3010 All reports submitted must be legible. Illegible forms will be returned to the hospital. The hospital should keep a record of reports submitted to the State. Cancer Registry personnel will keep track of reports received from each hospital. F. Confidentiality As correction and follow -up reports are being completed, care should be taken to ensure that the content of each is treated with the same level of security and confidentiality as the medical record. These reports are abbreviated medical records and should be treated as such. A full discussion of confidentiality is found in Chapter 8 of this manual. PART II. FOLLOW -UP Reporting annual follow -up data to the State Cancer Registry is optional. The State encourages hospitals to report follow -up information whenever possible in order to obtain a more complete record. Accurate and compl ete information about the current health of each patient may be difficult to obtain, but the importance of collecting this information is undeniable. A. Frequency of Follow -Up Follow -up efforts should be initiated on those patients for whom no informatio n has been received within the last 12 months. Cases are considered delinquent if no contact has been made within 15 months after the date of last contact. A follow -up (tickler) file must be maintained, either manually or by computer, by which to identif y patients due for follow -up. For hospitals that submit follow -up information, it is recommended that follow -up data collection be a monthly task of the hospital that first treats a case. B. Cases to Include in Follow -Up The American College of Surgeons , Commission on Cancer, requires annual follow -up on all analytic cases . Corrections And Follow -up Chapter 6 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 218 A hospital may elect to report recurrence or follow -up information on any case that has been reported to the State Cancer Registry. See Chapter 3 on Reporting for further informati on on the reportable cases. Patient of advanced age and stage of disease should not be assumed deceased and withdrawn from follow -up after a prescribed time period. These patients may have exceptional responses and occasionally be long -term survivors. C. Cases Not to Include in Follow -Up Carcinoma in situ of the cervix Non-analytic cases (cases neither diagnosed nor receiving any part of the first course of therapy at the reporting hospital) Patients residing in foreign countries Cases that were not required to be reported to the State Cancer Registry (see Chapter 3, Section D of this manual. ) D. Data Fields to Include in Follow -Up The State Cancer Registry needs minimal follow -up data on patients in its database in order to calculate survival time from date of cancer diagnosis to date of death. This data includes: Date of last contact or death Patient's vital status (alive or dead) Cancer status (with or without disease) A full explanation of these items is found in Chapte r 5 of this manual. There are additional data items relating to recurrences and follow -up that hospitals may want to collect for their registries: date and type of first recurrence, distant site(s) of first recurrence, and subsequent treatment for persi stent or recurrent disease. Since the State Registry does not collect these items, they will not be explained here. Please refer to the Standards for Oncology Registry Entry (STORE ) for coding rules and information. E. Follow -Up Sources 1. Most follow -up information is obtained through review of hospital readmissions, outpatient visits, or letters to the patient's physician. Hospitals are encouraged to share follow -up information with other facilities that are following the same patient. Remember to r e-contact physicians even though the first contact may not have been productive. After a period of time, the patient may have returned for a subsequent visit to the physician. When these methods are not effective in providing follow -up information, a var iety of other sources may be employed. 2. Hospital policy, consistent with legal requirements for confidentiality, should be developed governing potential contact with relatives, friends, etc. If hospital policy permits, patients may be contacted by letter or telephone. All patient contact should be accomplished in a responsible and compassionate manner. Many hospitals' policies caution against mention of the patient's diagnosis. 3. Voter Registration roles can be a source of addresses for patients who have moved. Date of the last election in which the patient voted or date of registration to vote may be used as the date of last contact if no further information can be obtained. 4. Miscellaneous methods of locating patients include th e Social Security Administration office, medical and life insurance companies, local utility companies, and credit bureaus. Most of these sources will provide only last known address. Chapter 6 Corrections and Follow -up Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 219 5. More information on follow -up techniques can be obtained through th e American College of Surgeons .

OVERVIEW Definition Quality control is the cancer registry function concerned with the assessment and improvement of data quality. The characteristics of quality include case completeness, data accuracy, data completeness, and timeliness. Goals To detect and correct errors or omissions in existing data; To identify and effectively address opportunities for improvement in tr aining, documentation, and/or systems in order to assure the quality of subsequent data collection. Responsibility A designated CTR (Certified Tumor Registrar) is responsible for the quality assurance program. Qualified, experienced CTRs conduct quality assurance activities. Components of Quality Control The State Registry quality control activities include the following: Analysis of observed/expected completeness rates Casefinding audits Reabstracting and re -coding audits Visual editing of data quality Computer editing of data quality Evaluation and consolidation of case -sharing and duplicates Procedure manual (documentation) maintenance Staff training and development Feedback and consultation from quality control activities to data collectors Resolution of discrepancies B. ASSESSMENT/IMPROVEMENT OF DATA ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS 1. Observed/Expected Completeness Rates Case Volume Case volume is monitored to assess and improve the completeness of data. The actual number of cases reported b y each facility is compared to an estimated expected volume. The expected case volume for a year is based on an assessment of the number of cases reported in each of the preceding five years. An annual caseload can be estimated by the number of acute car e medical and surgical beds at the facility. A hospital with 250 acute medical and surgical beds may typically see 250 new cancer cases per year. For small hospitals without radiation therapy centers, this figure is probably within 20% of the actual case load for the first years of the registry. For hospitals offering radiation therapy, 50% is added to the total number of beds to determine annual caseload (e.g., a hospital with 100 beds would see 150 cancer cases per year). This formula is not reliable f or major referral centers. When fewer reports are received than expected for a given year, the reporting source is contacted to assess the reason. If the decline in number of cases is not the result of an explainable cause, such as a change in facility services or an abstracting backlog, the facility will be asked to review casefinding procedures. The Indiana State Cancer Registry personnel will be available for consultation and assistance in the review. A review would include an examination of the hos pital's patient index; pathology reports; chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and outpatient logs; diagnostic or disease index; and print -outs of cancer -related diagnostic codes from the billing system. Chapter 7 Quality Control Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 225 Patterns Indiana data is compared with national avera ges in order to assess and improve the completeness of data. Based on data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute, the proportion of cases from each of the common organ sites is compared to Ind iana data and used to determine whether Indiana data are comparable to national data. Any discrepancies will be investigated. 2. Casefinding Audits Casefinding audits are performed to assess and improve the completeness of reporting. The audit is a study to verify that a facility is reporting all applicable newly diagnosed cancer cases and to help the facility improve casefinding procedures if needed. The audit involves reviewing the facility's casefinding procedures and all sources for potential ca ses in the facility. The cases identified in this review are compared with cases reported and missed cases are documented. The reviewer calculates a completeness rate from these numbers and compares the rate with the completeness rate goal of 95%. Separ ate procedures are available describing in more detail how casefinding audits are conducted. Each year the State Registry will select up to 20% of Indiana hospitals for casefinding audits. Sample specifications will be based on hospital annual caseload. Six months will be reviewed for hospitals with 0 -100 annual cases. Three months will be reviewed for hospitals with 101 -499 annual cases. One month will be reviewed for hospitals with 500 or more annual cases. The State Registry will make consultativ e recommendations to the hospital registrar during the audit and will submit a written report of results and recommendations to the hospital and the State Registry within thirty days of the audit. 3. Reabstracting Audits Reabstracting audits are performed to assess and improve data accuracy in terms of the data collectors' adherence to established principles of coding, abstracting, and staging. The audit involves reviewing the facility's source records for randomly selected cases and reabstractin g selected data elements. The reabstracted items are compared with the facility's abstract and discrepancies are reviewed to identify needs for clarification, corrections, and education. Separate procedures are available describing in more detail how rea bstracting audits are conducted. Each year the State Registry will select up to twelve (10%) Indiana hospitals for reabstracting audits. The sample will be limited to a subset of cases diagnosed the previous year in the same half of the year as the time of the audit. The State Registry staff will make consultative recommendations to the hospital registrar at the time of the audit and will submit a written report of results and recommendations to the hospital and the State Registry within thirty days of the audit. 4. Recoding Audits Recoding audits may be performed to assess and improve the accuracy of data from new coders or from coders with educational needs identified by other quality control activities. The audits involve independently reassigning codes to abstracted text information or from copies of specific medical record documentation requested from the facility. The recoded items are compared with the original codes submitted and discrepancies are analyzed to identify needs for clarification, correction, and education. The State Registry staff will submit a written report of results and recommendations to the hospital and the State Registry within thirty days of the audit. Quality Control Chapter 7 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 226 5. Consolidation Audits Audits of a sample of consolidated cases are performed to assess whether the \"best\" value for each of a specified set of variable s is coded in the final (summary) consolidated case s. All source records are reviewed in the audit process. 6. Quality Control for Newly Submitted Cases Each new submi ssion of cases is loaded into a subsystem and subjected to both visual and computer edits before being transferred into the main database. a. Visual Edits Visual editing is performed to assess and improve data accuracy and completeness. Visual reviews ar e performed on cases received by State Cancer Registry staff to determine if data are complete, as well as, logical and internally consistent. Visual editing includes assessment of frequency reports of required items for blank items or invalid codes. It may involve analysis of listings with specified data items for all cases in a subsystem. It may involve one hundred per cent review of each abstract when the cases involve difficult diagnoses, are from new coders, or are from coders with educational needs identified by other quality control activities. Dates of birth, accession years, admission and discharge, initial diagnosis, and treatment are monitored for logical progression. Accession number, sequence number, and class of case are visually reviewed for logic. Agreement with laterality, site codes, histology, and sex are reviewed for logical consistency. Completeness is assessed by monitoring the number of \"unknowns\" or blanks in demographic and cancer data. The reporting source is contacted as needed for correction, clarification, or completion of required data elements. Transcription accuracy reflects the quality of procedures for transferring the data from the paper abstract to electronic medium. For cases entered from paper abstracts by State Cancer Registry personnel, each screen is carefully checked against the abstract for transcription errors prior to transfer to the main database. b. Computer Edits The State Cancer Registry develop and apply State -required computerized edit sets ba sed on those from the NAACCR standard edits that are required by NPCR. These edits are provided to RMCDS hospitals; are available to facilities using other registry systems as part of the FTP submission procedure; and are made available to other vendors f or incorporation into their registry systems. The computerized edit sets assess the accuracy of all data received by applying standard computerized data edits. The computerized edits include the following: single field (to check for valid codes), multi -field (to check for consistency and logic between different fields), multi -record (to check for consistency between multiple sequences), and multi -database (to check for consistency between different hospitals seeing the same patient for the same tumor). Inconsistencies or discrepancies not detected during manual edit checks are identified by these edits. The Rocky Mountain Cancer Data Systems' (RMCDS) edit program, though no longer updated by the vender, are applied by the State Cancer Registry to identi fy potential Indiana ZIP code/county code inconsistencies that are not addressed by the NAACCR edits. State Registry staff members analyze the edit reports and the abstracts and make corrections as indicated. When the staff member determines that the ori ginal information is correct, the edit is overridden and the reason is recorded in the \"Comments\" section. Chapter 7 Quality Control Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 227 When the analysis of computerized edits identifies variations from coding rules or incomplete information, the issues are reported to the responsibl e facility for correction, clarification, or completion of required data elements. Responses from the reporting source with justification and/or documentation supporting the original information are reviewed and changes made as indicated. Quality control reviews are performed on reports before the data are released. In addition to the routine computerized edit checks, the subset of cases used in the report is checked for duplicate cases to ensure patients are not counted more than once for each tumor. P atterns in the data are studied for inconsistencies. For example, a listing of pediatric cases containing colon, breast, or prostate cancers would identify a need for further review and action 7. Consolidation The State Cancer Registry may receive duplicate reports for a single case from the same hospital, multiple hospitals, nonhospital facilities, death records, or another state registry. State Cancer Registry staff identify duplicate reports for a single case, resolve any discrepancies b etween reports, and consolidate the reports into a single record. Applicable multiple primary rules of the standard - setting organizations are applied. The purpose of consolidation procedures is to accurately determine cancer incidence in Indiana. Identification of Duplicate Cases The process of identifying duplicate reports (that have been submitted electronically) is initiated when recently received cases are transferred into the main database. See Attachment B, Procedure for Transferring Subsyste ms to the Main Database. The following mechanisms are used to identify potential duplicates: computer -automated merges, computer -generated identification of potential duplicates (error reports), manual search of the database by Social Security Number, and periodic execution of computerized multiple sequence consistency checking. Computer -automated Merges When critical identifying data elements are identical (e.g., patient name, Social Security Number, date of birth, sex, sequence number, primary site code ), the oncoming case merges with the duplicate case in the main database. A list of all such merges is generated by the system and printed by staff for analysis described in the Analysis of Discrepancies section below. Error and Possible Match Reports When some, but not all, critical, identifying data elements are identical, the oncoming case is added as a new case into the main database. The system identifies most of these cases on either the Error Report or the Possible Match Report. The Error Report lists the cases that match all critical elements except the primary site and identifies each new case by the original case's Central Tumor Registry (CTR) number and a sequence in the 90's. The Possible Match Report lists the cases that match all critical elements except the sex, date of birth, or Social Security Number and identifies each new case by a newly assigned CTR number with the sequence as reported. The reports are printed by staff for analysis described in the Analysis of Discrepancies section b elow. Note: The system does not identify possible matches that differ only in sequence, last name, or some variations in first name (e.g., Theodore versus Ted). Most of these are identified by Multiple Sequence Report analysis or the Social Security Num ber search procedure. Social Security Number Search After resolution of potential duplicates identified by the Error and Possible Match Reports, staff search the main database by the Social Security Numbers of all the oncoming cases, identifying additiona l potential duplicates for analysis described in the Analysis of Discrepancies section below. Quality Control Chapter 7 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 228 Computerized Multiple Sequence Consistency Checking The system's Multiple Sequence Consistency Checking identifies discrepancies between legitimate multiple pr imary cases, as well as potential duplicate cases that may not have been resolved in the procedures described above. This program is executed periodically and all discrepancies and potential duplicates are analyzed and resolved. The process of identifyin g duplicate reports (that have been submitted in other than electronic format) is initiated by manually searching the main database and subsystems. Matched records for the same patient are compared, using applicable multiple primary rules to determine whe ther the same primary is involved. If the reports are determined to be for the same primary, the analysis of discrepancies process described below is applied. Analysis of Discrepancies The abstracts for each of the potentially duplicate cases are opened and reviewed side by side so that all data items are compared and any discrepancies identified. For cases that were automatically merged, the original abstract for oncoming case is available as the \"pristine\" record, which can be opened and compare d with the existing abstract. Discrepancies between patient identifying data items may be resolved by searching the Social Security Death Index, if applicable. The reporting facilities may also be contacted for review of their source records for the corr ect information. If the analysis results in a determination that the cases are duplicate cases, the abstract that will be the consolidated record (the case with the earlier date -on- file) is corrected as applicable. Discrepancies between cancer identifyin g data items and treatment data are reviewed with analysis of supporting text; assessment of the more extensive diagnostic work -up; consideration of class of case and dates seen; and appropriate application of coding rules. The more accurate and complete information is identified. The reporting facilities may also be contacted for review of their source records for clarification. If the analysis results in a determination that the cases are duplicate cases, the abstract that will be the consolidated reco rd (the case with the earlier date -on-file) is corrected as applicable. If the analysis results in a determination that the reports are duplicate cases that have not been automatically merged, they are manually merged. The oncoming case is merged to the case with the earlier date -on-file (the consolidated case) by deleting the oncoming case and entering the consolidated case CTR number and sequence in the box provided by the system. The consolidated records for all merged cases retain the facility -specif ic information (accession number, sequence, admission and discharge dates, medical record number, and class of case) for up to ten facilities. In addition, the original abstract submitted by each facility is retained as a \"pristine\" record. If the analys is results in a determination that the cases are separate primaries (same patient) , both reports are saved. (If these were computer -automated merges, the cases are \"unmerged.\") Sequencing is updated, and any discrepancies between CTR number, Social Secur ity Number, race, date of birth, place of birth, date last seen, vital status, and cause of death are resolved and corrected. If the analysis results in a determination that the cases are separate primaries (different patients) , both reports are saved. After cases have been consolidated and pass all computerized edit checks, inter -record edit checks are applied periodically to identify and resolve inconsistencies between multiple primary records for one patient. Facility Feedback When the analysis of di screpancies identifies variations from coding rules, the issues are reported to the responsible facility for educational purposes. Chapter 7 Quality Control Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 229 8. Procedure Manual Maintenance Current, written documentation of the State Registry's definitions and methods are maintain ed in a policy and procedure manual, which is provided to all State Registry employees, contract consultants, and employees of reporting facilities. The manual documents the Registry's data set definitions, codes, coding rule interpretations, and procedur es. The standards of ACoS, NAACCR, and SEER are incorporated in the manual to the extent possible. Appropriate portions of the documentation will be provided to investigators and users of the data, as needed, to explain definitions and methods. A Policy and Procedure Manual maintenance system is used for updating the documentation and keeping it current. The system involves monitoring release of new standards, rules, and definitions by ACoS, NAACCR, and SEER. Information from quality control acti vities are also be used in assessing the need to revise the procedure manual. When revised, dated pages are provided to all Registry staff, contract consultants, and reporting facilities. A library of revisions to the manual is kept at the State Cancer Registry. When revised, dated pages are provided to all Registry staff, contract consultants, and reporting facilities. The State Cancer Registry also maintains an \"unusual case\" reference file to aid in consistent data collection for difficult cancers. 9. Staff Training and Development The State Cancer Registry provide training opportunities for employees of the State Registry and employees of reporting facilities. Training programs are developed in cooperation with the Indiana Cancer Registrars Assoc iation, Indiana Health Information Management Association, and Rocky Mountain Cancer Data Systems. Training will provide feedback to State Cancer Registry staff on the quality and effectiveness of services provided to reporting sources and the public. Training programs are based on standard reference manuals and may address the following areas: Anatomy and physiology Medical terminology Site specific or other topics in oncology Reporting requirements Confidentiality and information security Casefinding Abstracting/coding/staging Follow -up Quality control Data processing (computer software) American College of Surgeons updates Hospital based cancer/tumor registry management Topics identified through other quality control activities 10. Feedback and Consu ltation The results of quality control activities are reported to the applicable data collector to maintain data quality and eliminate recurring errors. Feedback may be written or by telephone call or one -on-one meetings. Feedback to the reporting facil ities include the following: Information about changes or corrections made to abstracts at the State Registry Discrepancy lists resulting from computer or visual edits Results of casefinding and reabstracting audits with analysis of discrepancies and recommendations for improvement Information from analysis of observed/expected completeness rates. The abstractor's identification and date completed are required items in the RMCDS and are useful in identifying contacts for feedback. A complete list of the abstractors and/or contact person for each hospital is maintained at the State Cancer Registry. When feedback is indicated, the questions are directed to the person on this list. Quality Control Chapter 7 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 230 C. ISSUES RELATED TO QUALITY 1. Timeliness of Data Data collection must be conducted according to schedule. With the exception of early deaths, no case should be abstracted less than four months after admission. Abstracting too soon may result in the omission of important information from the database if complete information is unavailable at the time of abstracting. Cases are due at the State Registry no later than six months following a confirmed diagnosis. Abstracting too late reduces the usefulness of the cancer registry data and reports. Cases subm itted by each reporting source are monitored for timely receipt. 2. Personnel Data collection in reporting facilities must be performed by knowledgeable and qualified individuals. The individuals serve as the primary abstractors and may be responsible f or staff supervision, cancer case auditing, and report writing. The Commission on Cancer, American College of Surgeons encourages registry staff to maintain Certified Tumor Registrar (CTR) credentials. The State Cancer Registry can provide hospitals wit h information on how to become a CTR, certified by the National Cancer Registrars Association (NCRA). Information on NCRA is found in Chapter 1 on References. 3. Use of References and Edits Hospital staff should use available reference materials, many o f which are free, rather than trying to memorize codes. Hospitals with computerized registries should ensure all records pass computer edits at the hospital level before sending data to the State. Standard edits, such as the EDITS project system develope d by NAACCR, are available from standard setting organizations. 4. Maintenance of Logs and Records Hospitals must keep documentation by date sent of reports submitted to the State Cancer Registry. Hospitals submitting paper abstracts must submit a legib le copy of the original to the State Cancer Registry and keep the original for their records. State Cancer Registry personnel will keep a copy of discrepancy reports returned to the reporting source for completion, clarification, and correction. 5. Submitting Correction or Follow -Up Chapter 6 details how to submit corrections and follow -up information. Two correction forms, which permit changes or deletions to be made to the Hospital Abstract Form, are explained. The Correction and Follow -Up Form also allows reporting of annual follow -up information. 6. Other Resources Further information on quality control procedures may be obtained by requesting Volume I: Cancer Program Standards published by the Commission on Cancer, American College of Surge ons. The State Cancer Registry complies with the NAACCR Standards for Cancer Registries , Volume III: Standards for Completeness , Quality , Analysis , and Management of Data. Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 231 CHAPTER 8: CONFID ENTIALITY A. OVERVIEW 1. Purpose The State Cancer Registry is committed to preserving the confidentiality of information obtained for medical, educational, research, and statistical purposes. Confidentiality policies and procedures are maintained in all phases of the State Registry operations in order to: Protect the privacy of individual patients; Protect the privacy of the facilities reporting the cases; Abide by applicable confidentiality -protecting legislation or administrative rule s. 2. Definition Confidential data includes any information that identifies a specific patient, health care professional, or institution. The obligation to protect confidentiality extends indefinitely, even after the death of the patient. Legal requir ements for confidentiality are described in IC 16 -38-2-(4-7) and 410 IAC 21 -1-5, found in Appendix A. B. RESPONSIBILITY 1. Reporting Source (Hospital or Other Health Care Provider) The reporting source (hospital or other health care provider) is respons ible for protecting the confidentiality of registry data collected and maintained on site and for submitting data to the State Registry in a way that protects confidentiality. The hospital should develop and implement confidentiality policies and procedur es that address staff training, access control, record/abstract handling and storage, and release of registry data. Paper abstracts must be handled and stored in a way that prevents unauthorized individuals from viewing confidential data. Information ma intained in computerized systems must be protected by physical and electronic measures to control access to confidential data. Hospitals should mail copies of completed abstracts and/or patient record copies promptly to the State Registry, following the i nstructions in Chapter 3 of this manual for sealing and labeling the container and for keeping records of the cases submitted. 2. State Registry The Program Director is ultimately responsible for information security at the State Registry. This responsi bility includes ensuring that State Registry staff are accountable for compliance with the confidentiality policies and procedures of this chapter. C. STATE REGISTRY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 1. Staff Awareness a. All State Registry personnel and consultants receive specific training about the confidentiality of registry information and their responsibilities. b. All personnel handling or having access to cancer registry data are required to sign a Confidentiality Agreement. This includes staff f rom other departments, sections, or programs that are outside the State Cancer Registry but within the Indiana Department of Health. The agreement documents that the employee has read and understands the State Cancer Registry policies for handling the dat a, agrees to abide by the policies, and is aware that failure to comply with any of these requirements constitutes a class A misdemeanor which Confidentiality Chapter 8 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 232 will result in disciplinary action in accordance with State policies. The agreement remains in effect after cess ation of employment. A copy of the Confidentiality Agreement is available from the State Cancer Registry upon request. 2. Access Control a. A current, written list of persons with legitimate access to confidential cancer data is kept in the State Cancer Registry office. The nature and extent of their access to registry data are defined and are restricted to the information needed to do his/her job. b. All file cabinets where confidential data are stored in open areas are locked except when in use by aut horized State Cancer Registry staff. The file room designated for the Cancer Registry Program is locked except when authorized State Cancer Registry staff are present. c. Employees are provided with the equipment for ensuring the physical security of con fidential information. Confidential patient abstracts are stored in locked file cabinets. Backup tapes of the statewide database are stored in a locked, fireproof safe. d. Field staff maintain abstracts and/or printed reports in locked briefcases which are kept in a secure place when unattended. Access to confidential information is limited to authorized hospital personnel. Discussions regarding patient records occur only in settings where privacy is assured. e. The computer system provides access onl y to authorized individuals. The system has a three tiered level of security. 1) The first level is the user Login Name. Each central registry staff logging into the network file server must enter his/her unique user login name. 2) The second level is the confidential password, established by the user. The password is altered on a regular basis and when there is concern that security may be in jeopardy. 3) The third level is the password to gain entry to the Rocky Mountain Cancer Data Systems (RMCDS) software. Network users who need the data for epidemiologic studies may be allowed limited access to only the non -confidential portions of the database. The RMCDS program is set up to allow \"Read Only\" for such individuals. When a user is no longer employed at the State Registry, his/her password and access codes are deactivated immediately. f. Disclosure or sharing of codes, numbers, or names used to access the computer is strictly prohibited. g. When printed reports containing confidential information are no longer needed, they are disposed of by shredding. 3. Data Collection and Management a Electronically Submitted Data The State supports the programs described below that ensure the secure transmission of electronic cancer data by report ing facilities. 1) The FTP Program The preferred method for submitting data is the ISCR FTP Program that encrypts the facility's data file and sends it to the ISCR through the Internet using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). If the facility prohibits or limits the use of FTP, the program can also send the encrypted file as an e -mail attachment. The method meets government security requirements. Chapter 8 Confidentiality Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 233 2) Web Plus An alternate method is the Web Plus program that securely uploads the facility's data file through a browser. The method also meets government security requirements. b. Submitting on Diskettes Effective July 2009 the State Cancer Registry no longer processes data submitted on diskettes. Diskettes received and processed prior to this date have been securely backed up to a server and have been destroyed by the Commission on Public Records. c. Abstract Forms & Paper Copies of Medical Records Mail labeled \"CONFIDENTIAL MEDICAL INFORMATION\" is opened only by designated State Registry staff. Such mail is kept in a secure location before and after it is processed. State Cancer Registry personnel stamp each form with the date received and maintain a register by hospital documenting the date the batch was received, the date the batch was entered, the num ber of forms enclosed, and the accession year for the cases. The State Registry retains the abstract forms and registers indefinitely. After processing, abstract forms are filed by hospital, accession year, and accession number. d. Quality Control Communications When State Registry quality control (QC) activities require returning abstracts, inquiry forms, or discrepancy lists to reporting facilities, the mailings are carefully sealed and labeled \"CONFIDENTIAL MEDICAL INFORMATION.\" When te lephone calls are made to address QC issues, reasonable efforts are made to ensure the conversations are private and addressed to an authorized data collector at the reporting facility. When QC communications are transmitted by electronic mail (e -mail), p atient -identifying information will be limited to accession numbers. Patient -identifying e -mail received at the State Registry is treated with the same level of security and confidentiality as other confidential medical information. e. Facsimile Transmis sion Confidential information should be transmitted via facsimile only when urgently needed for patient care. When such transmission is necessary, the cover page will include a confidentiality notice that indicates the information is confidential and lim its its use. After transmission, a follow -up call will be made to verify that the information was sent to the appropriate destination. 4. Disaster Recovery The Indiana Department of Health Information Technology Services is responsible for the comprehens ive disaster recovery plan that includes the State Cancer Registry data and systems. The plan includes frequent and regular backup, off -site storage, and procedures for retrieval. It is designed to protect operating systems, applications, and data. 5. Sabotage Anti-virus software is used to help detect and block computer viruses and other forms of sabotage. 6. Release of Registry Data a. Hospital Requests Confidential information may be released by authorized State Registry personnel to health care pr oviders and institutions upon verbal or written request and without further review procedures under either of the following circumstances: 1. The requestor is directly involved in the care or follow -up of the patient; 2) The information requested is from the hospital's own registry. b. Patient or Individual Requests Confidentiality Chapter 8 2021 Indiana Cancer Registry 234 The State Cancer Registry staff do not respond to individuals requesting whether or not the State Registry contains information about them. Individuals making such requests are referred to their treating physician. c. Physician Requests Confidential information may be released to physicians and local health officers for diagnostic and treatment purposes if the patient signs a written consent and the patient's attending physician gives verbal or written consent to the release. d. Other States Pursuant to IC 16 -38-2-7, effective May 15, 1988, the Indiana Cancer Registry may release confidential information concerning individual cancer patients to the cancer registry of another state und er the following condition: The other state has entered into a reciprocal agreement with the State Cancer Registry which provides that information that identifies a patient will not be released to any other person without the written consent of the patien t. e. Other External Requests 1) Requests for use of confidential data are handled in accordance with IC 16 -38-2-(5-7). 2) Confidential cancer registry data will not be made available for the following purposes: a) Businesses that are trying to market a product to cancer patients; b) Health care institutions that are trying to recruit new patients; c) Insurance companies that are trying to determine the medical status of a patient. 3) Requests for State Cancer Registry data for other purposes, such as r esearch projects, are processed as outlined below. a) The request must be submitted in writing and include the following information: The purpose for which data are needed or an outline of the proposed research with a justification of the need for the dat a; The information required; The names of the persons who will have access to the confidential information; The time period for which the data are needed. A record is kept of the date and type of all requests. b) The written request is submitted to the Indiana Department of Health Data Request Committee for review. The committee must approve the request before release can be made. The State Cancer Registry reserves the right to limit the amount of data to be provided to an individual requestor. c) If the request is approved, researchers must sign an agreement acknowledging responsibility to maintain patient confidentiality, cite the source of the data in any publication or presentation, and provide the State Cancer Registry with copies of any publi cations or presentations that may use the data prior to their release. Violation of any part of this agreement shall prevent further access to the data, and shall result in a letter of reprimand to the chief executive officer of the researcher's instituti on. In addition, other researchers at the institution may be denied access to the data until the Program Director is assured that no other violations will occur. All requestors must assure: That he/she is bound by the principles of confidentiality observ ed by the personnel of the State Cancer Registry; That the data will not be used for purposes other than those agreed upon at the time of release; Chapter 8 Confidentiality Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 235 That the data will not be released to unauthorized individuals or parties; and That data that are no longer n eeded for the designated purpose will be returned or destroyed. f. State Initiated Requests The Program Director monitors all state initiated research activities to ensure that only relevant activities are undertaken. State affiliated researchers are expected to abide by the same restrictions as outside researchers.

Care Indianapolis Indiana Cancer Registry 2021 278 APPENDIX E: RULES FOR DETERMINING MULTIPLE PRIMARIES FOR LYMPHATIC AND HEMATOPOIETIC DISEASES Definitions of single and subsequent primaries for hematologic malignancies based on ICD-O-3 reportable malignancies, 01/01/2001 through 12/31/2009 . Cancer registrars are often faced with multiple pathology reports for patients with hematologic malignancies, and the diagnoses reported may require different morpholog y codes. This is due in part to the fact that more intensive diagnostic study may yield a more specific diagnosis, and in part to the natural histories of hematopoietic diseases, which may progress from one diagnosis into another. The table on the follow ing pages, provided to aid the registrar in determining single versus subsequent primaries, employs the following guidelines: 1. \"Lymphoma\" is a general term for hematopoietic solid malignancies of the lymphoid series. \"Leukemia\" is a general term for li quid malignancies of either the lymphoid or the myeloid series. While it is recognized that some malignancies occur predominantly (or even exclusively) in liquid or solid form, because so many malignancies can potentially arise as either leukemias or lymp homas (or both), all hematopoietic malignancies are assumed to have this potential. 2. Malignancies of the lymphoid series are considered to be different from those of the myeloid series. Therefore, a lymphoid malignancy arising after diagnosis of a myelo id malignancy (or myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative disorder) would be considered a subsequent primary; however, a myeloid malignancy diagnosed after a previous myeloid malignancy would not count as a subsequent primary. Histiocytic malignancies are c onsidered different from both lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. 3. Hodgkin lymphoma is considered to be different from non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Among the NHLs, B - cell malignancies are considered different from T -cell/NK cell malignancies. Therefore, a B-cell malignancy arising later in the course of a patient previously diagnosed with a T -cell malignancy would be considered a subsequent primary. However, a T -cell malignancy diagnosed later in the same patient would not be considered a subsequent pri mary. 4. The sequence of diagnoses affects whether a diagnosis represents a subsequent primary. In some cases, the order of occurrence of the two diagnoses being compared is a factor in the decision as to whether the second diagnosis is a new primary. How to Use the Table Assign the ICD-O-3 code to the first diagnosis and find the row containing that code. Assign the ICD-O-3 code for the second diagnosis and find the column containing that code. In the cell at the intersection of the first diagnosis r ow and the second diagnosis column, an \" S\" symbol indicates that the two diagnoses are most likely the same disease process (prepare/update a single abstract), and a \" D\" indicates that they are most likely different disease processes (prepare more than one abstract). Note 1: If one of the two diagnoses is an NOS (not otherwise specified) term and the other is more specific and determined to be the same disease process, code the more specific diagnosis regardless of the sequence. For example, if a diagnosis of non -Hodgkin ly mphoma, NOS is followed by a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma, assign the morphology code for the follicular lymphoma. Note 2: The table on the following pages and the \"Complete Diagnostic Terms for Table (Based on ICD-O-3)\" display only the ICD-O-3 primary (boldfaced) term associated with the code. Refer to the International Classification of Diseases, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) for a complete list of related terms and synonyms. Prepared by: SEER Program, NCI, 02/28/2001.

E -mail: seerweb@ims.nci.nih.gov Indiana State Cancer Registry 2021 286 APPENDIX F: CODING TIPS Appendix F is under revision and unavailable at this time. Indiana State Cancer Registry 2021 287 APPENDIX G: SURGERY TREATMENT CODES DEFINITIONS AND RULES Additional site -specific definitions and rules may be found with the site -specific codes. Surgical Procedure of Primary Site a. If registry software allows only one procedure to be collected, document the most invasive surgical procedure for the primary site. If registry software allows multiple procedures to be recorded, \"Surgical Procedure of Primary Site\" refers to the most invasive surgic al procedure of the primary site. b. For codes 00 through 79, the code positions are hierarchical. The codes' numeric sequence may deviate from the order in which the codes are listed. Last -listed codes take precedence over codes listed above, because: 1) Within groups of codes, procedures are listed with increasing degrees of descriptive precision; and 2) Succeeding groups of codes define progressively more extensive forms of resection. Example for RECTOSIGMOID (C19.9): A polypectomy with electrocaute ry is coded 22. 20 Local tumor excision, NOS 26 Polypectomy 27 Excisional biopsy Combination of 20 or 26 -27 WITH 21 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) 22 Electrocautery 23 Cryosurgery 24 Laser ablation 25 Laser excision c. Use codes 80 and 90 only if more precise information about the surgery is unavailable. d. Code 98 applies to specific tumors that cannot be clearly defined in terms of primary or non -primary site. Use code 98 for the following: All hematopoietic/reticuloendothelial/immunoproliferative/ myeloproliferative disease sites and/or histologies, WITH or WITHOUT surgical treatment; All unknown and ill -defined disease sites, WITH or WITHOUT surgical treatment. If any surgical treatment was performed on these cancers, assign code 1 in the item, \"S urgical Procedure/Other Site.\" e. Biopsies that remove all of the tumor and/or leave only microscopic margins are to be coded in \"Surgical Procedure of Primary Site.\" f. Surgery to remove regional tissue or organs is coded in \"Surgical Procedure of Prima ry Site\" only if the tissue/organs are removed in continuity with the primary site, except where noted in Appendix G. g. If a previous surgical procedure to remove a portion of the primary site is followed by surgery to remove the remainder of the primary site, then code the total or final results.
