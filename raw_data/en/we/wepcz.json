Hong Kong is significant for me both personally and artistically. My mother was born in Hong Kong and migrated to Australia. As an artist, I felt compelled to visit Hong Kong to immerse myself in its history, culture, and dynamic arts scene to enrich my artistic practice and strengthen my professional development. I aimed to conduct archival research through personal family archives and visit significant sites of my mother's past. I planned to research Chinese herbal medicine and use these materials to develop new works exploring the poetics of healing. I also wanted to undertake a short course on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, to incorporate new philosophical knowledge into my art practice. Highlights During my residency, I immersed myself in the dynamic Hong Kong arts scene and visited as many museums, galleries and art spaces as possible. Some highlights include: - Asia Society Hong Kong Center: 'Breathing Space', an exhibition of contemporary art about urban life in Hong Kong, displayed across the stunning architecturally designed space of the institution. - Floating Projects: an independent non-profit art space run for emerging artists. I made contact with two young local artists Joseph Leung and Andy Li. - Spring Workshop: a private non-profit art space dedicated to interdisciplinary art with residencies, exhibitions, music performances and talks. I made contact with Christina Li, the Director and Curator, and was given a tour of the amazing space. - Central arts precinct, high-end commercial galleries: Gagosian, Pace, Pearl Lam, Lehmann Maupin, White Galerie Wong precinct, edgier commercial galleries: Blindspot, De Sarthe Gallery, Rossi & Rossi. - Tin Wan arts precinct, the most exciting and experimental commercial galleries: Gallery Exit, representing experimental Hong Kong artists, and Empty Gallery, an incredible 'black box' private commercial gallery specialising in video and new media, that had an exhibition by Takeshi Murata, a LA-based Japanese artist working with experimental video, animation, CG, glitch, and datamoshing. Success A major success of my residency was exhibiting with Artereal Gallery at Art Central, where they sold my entire series of sculptures to a significant private collection in China. This was a strong outcome to have my artwork placed into an international collection. Another excellent outcome was introducing my sculptural and photographic practice to international curators. I made a new professional connection with Karen Chang, an independent curator based in Hong Kong. We are currently negotiating a commission for me to create a new live performance work in a major exhibition in Hong Kong later "}
