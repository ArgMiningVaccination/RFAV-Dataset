Why use natural cleaning products? There are many great reasons to switch to organic or natural cleaning products. Keep toxins out of your home. Most homemade products are toxin-free! Save some money. Cut down on what you're sending to the landfill. You can cut back dramatically on plastics by simply using reusable spray bottles and cleaning containers. Use natural products because someone in your home has asthma or allergies. (Organic cleaners are much better to use around those with sensitivities.) Interestingly enough, the stuff that you clean with can actually make you sick, essentially negating the benefits of cleaning itself. These ingredients can also lead to birth defects in pregnant women using the cleaners. Although many people don't have any reactions to the toxins, why take a chance? Perhaps the most common reason people choose organic cleaners is that they're safer to have around the house than the store-bought versions. You'd think that cleaning products would have to be safe to be sold for home use, but that isn't always the case. Orange Essential Oil Citrus Sinensis is obtained from the peels of orange by cold compression. The very smell of orange essential oil reminds you of happy moments and brings pleasant thoughts to mind. That is why this oil is so frequently used in aromatherapy. It creates a happy, relaxed feeling and works as a mood lifter. Orange Essential Oil provides relief from inflammation, relaxes muscular and nervous spasms, inhibits microbial growth and disinfects wounds. Sweet orange oil also boosts immunity, alleviates anxiety, anger and depression, cures acne and dermatitis. Another benefit of orange oil is that it promotes urination, eliminates toxins, and treats constipation. Tea Tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) Want a powerful essential oil for cleaning? Then tea tree is your answer. Sometimes considered to be a strong smell on its own, it is often combined with other essential oils, such as lavender or orange in green cleaning recipes. As an antimicrobial, antifungal, antiseptic, bactericidal, and insecticidal, it is an awesome choice when it comes to cleaning the bathroom or kitchen. "}
