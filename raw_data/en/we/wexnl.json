At a certain point, the energy in the air shifts. You feel in tune with yourself, more confident, maybe even a little sexier than usual. You may feel the urge to sit down and [focus on self-reflection](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/g38526189/best-journaling-apps/), or, alternatively, connect with other women that make you feel strong. Well, look to the stars, or check your favorite astrology app. It might just be because [it's a full moon](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/g39047258/traditional-full-moon-names/). You've likely heard before that the full moon can impact people on a physical and psychological level. \"Think about how we all feel around the full moon. The energy is high, it's intense, so let's work with it,\" says Julia Halina Hadas, a witch, cocktail mixologist, and author of The Modern Witchcraft Book of Astrology: Your Complete Guide to Empowering Your Magick With the Energy of the Planets. \"Think of it as if the energy is the wind pushing you forward.\" The biggest question, though: How does one utilize the power of this monthly cosmic phenomenon to better themselves? There are actually a hundred different ways you can observe the full moon and harness its power in order to set positive intentions and meet your goals. And because the full moon is a monthly occurrence, you can keep up with a regular practice, or ritual, that will help you make the most of this special time. Meet the Experts: [Julia Halina Hadas](https://www.instagram.com/juliahalinahadas/?hl=en) is a witch, cocktail mixologist, and author of [The Modern Witchcraft Book of Astrology: Your Complete Guide to Empowering Your Magick With the Energy of the Plants](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1507220154). [Aliza Kelly](https://www.alizakelly.com/) is a professional astrologer, author, and founder of the [Constellation Club](https://www.instagram.com/constellationclub/?hl=en) coven.

Listen, I'm not saying that every 29 days or so your living room has to become a scene right out of The Craft\u2014a ritual is whatever you make it. And in this case, full moon rituals are monthly occasions to expel negativity from your life, manifest your goals, and connect with your own inner power. What is a full moon? Scientifically speaking, the full moon occurs when the sun and the moon are perfectly aligned on either side of planet Earth. Because of this, the face of the moon is fully illuminated: You can see its light and beauty in the night sky just as easily as you can see the sun during the day. Spiritually, though, the full moon has different meanings across cultures. All in all, the moon is closely associated with the divine feminine and is viewed as a period of power and transformation. \"Generally speaking, the full moons are an incredible time for release, letting go, and really taking inventory of what's in our life,\" says Aliza Kelly, professional astrologer, author, and founder of the Constellation Club coven. To truly understand what a specific full moon represents, it is also important to look at its astrology. When the moon is full, it will always be in the opposite sign of the sun. For example, if the sun is in Aries, the full moon will be in Libra, and vice versa. \"You have these two diametrically opposed forces that are in opposite signs during the full moon,\" notes Kelly. \"The sun represents your external truth, and then the moon represents your emotional, internal truth.'' During the full moon, \"you're getting a full range of insight and perspective.\" What are some full moon rituals I can try at home? When crafting your full moon rituals, keep the scientific, the spiritual, and the astrological aspects in mind. These 22 ritual ideas can help you harness the power of the full moon, whether you're looking to try a new one each month or welcome a few new ideas into your regular practice. 1. Make an altar. Much like rituals themselves, an altar is whatever you make it. This can be a designated space for you to carry out your full moon rituals, or a spot in your home to sit down and relax, meditate, or journal. Your altar can be as simple as the bedside table you light your candles on or the kitchen counter where you make your meals. \"Bring in elements that coincide with the season and the current energy of that moon,\" says Sarah Potter, tarot reader, psychic medium, and resident witch at the Ashbury Hotel. \"I always go to the store and pick up the freshest looking flowers in whatever colors of the season.\" 2. Brew some moon water. Moon water can become a tool in many of your full moon rites. Simply set a basin or sealed container of water outside or on your window sill, and let the moon do the rest. Because water is so closely associated with the moon, [the moon water](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a42886222/moon-water/) you brew will become infused with its power and can be used for ritual baths, craft cocktails, dissolving rituals, and so much more. 3. Create a cocktail. Drink in the power of the full moon with a cocktail, mocktail, or herbal tea. All you need? Moon water ingredients that coincide with the energy of the moon, and [your own manifestation powers](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a40299364/how-to-manifest/). \"Part of the process of making a drink is this kinesthetic type of magick,\" says Hadas. She suggests mixing counterclockwise to get rid of things you don't want in your life, and clockwise to bring positive energy in. Additionally, you can add ingredients specifically associated with the moon, like lemon, or herbs like rosemary for cleansing. \"Add every ingredient with the intention,\" she says. \"When you're ingesting it, visualize bringing that energy into your life,\" says Hadas. 4. Light a candle. [Lighting a candle](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/g31078512/best-massage-candles/) is one of the most efficient ways to make magick happen under the full moon. You can do whatever kind of candle spell you see fit, or maybe one specifically for the full moon. \"A silver candle is always great or a white candle to really tap into that lunar energy,\" says Potter. \"Write down your intention on a piece of paper, fold it up, and place it under the candle. When you light that candle you set the intention into motion.\" (Spoiler alert: Writing down your intentions is key for so many full moon rituals.) 5. Try a burning ritual. Yay, more playing with fire! Just make sure you're practicing proper fire safety, okay? Burning rituals are one of the surefire ways (pun intended) to use the transformative power of the moon to rid yourself of things that are no longer serving you. \"Write what you want to let go of on a piece of paper, and then burn it with a candle,\" Kelly says. It's as easy as that. 6. Dissolve negativity. Not a fan of fire? That's okay. Because water and the moon go hand in hand, you can do a dissolving ritual to achieve the same effect. \"Write what you want to let go of and put it in a bowl of water,\" Kelly says. \"Add some salt to that water to get that kind of ocean-like feel to it. Then, the salt water dissolves the paper. You can aid that along with ripping it up with your hands in the water, too.\" 7. Cast a chart. Astrology fans, it's your turn! You probably already do this all the time, so why not take the full moon as your opportunity to sit down and cast a chart? See what the stars are doing, which signs the planets are in, and what's in retrograde, and prepare for what's in store with the upcoming moon cycle. \"I really like to base a lot of my rituals off of whatever the story is of that lunation,\" says Kelly. \"I look at the chart, I see what planets are involved, I see what storylines are present, and then I'll develop a unique ritual based on the flavor of what that particular lunation is.\" 8. Gather with friends. This one is easy\u2014and fun. Make each full moon a special time to [get together with your girls](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a28800305/how-to-make-friends-as-an-adult/). It's what witchy besties have been doing since the dawn of time. \"Full moons have always been a time for gathering,\" says Kelly. \"We've had night markets and different lunar festivals on the full moon because you have the illumination from the moon so you can see in the dark in ways you wouldn't be able to for other lunations.\" 9. Share your feelings. This one might be a little unexpected, but it's incredibly important and easy. \"Share what is going on with you, share what you're feeling, share what is on your mind, share what your sensations are,\" says Kelly. \"The reason for this is because the full moon is so linked to our emotions.\" Gathering with friends and sharing your emotions can help you and your community find commonalities and support each other, she adds. 10. Draw a ritual bath. Bring that moon water back! It's time to take a relaxing ritual bath. This is the perfect way to quite literally soak in the power of the full moon. You can draw yourself a simple bath, or add some moon water, [essential oils](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19904702/essential-oils/) associated with the moon like eucalyptus, or herbs that are linked to whatever sign the moon is presently in. You can also step it up a notch by making homemade sugar and salt scrubs infused with ingredients associated with the moon, suggests Hadas. (These might include lemon, rosemary, and salt.) Scrub off the negativity and soak in the positivity [while you relax and unwind](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/g40992265/stress-relief-gifts/). 11. Consult the cards. It's divination time! Whether [tarot cards](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a41319340/beginner-tarot-spreads/), oracle cards, or runes are your vibe, the full moon is the perfect time to make a spread that will let you know what's going on in your life, or help you make decisions and set intentions for the days, weeks, and months ahead. \"You can pull cards to get insight on what the message is of the moon, what tools you have available,\" says Kelly. Use the cards to ask yourself: \"What am I releasing, what am I pulling in, what should I be aware of, and what should I know right now?\" 12. Practice scrying. Much like consulting your tarot cards, scrying can be a perfect way to get the 411 from a full moon. Basically, scrying means using water, fire, or a mirror to gaze into the future. When scrying with fire, \"You can look into the flame of a candle as a meditation to ground yourself, to listen to your inner wisdom, and to sort of allow this moment of 'what should I really be focusing my energy on?' and then that will illuminate for you,\" says Kelly. The same can be said for other modes of scrying: Look into the surface of still water, or get your hands on a [black scrying mirror](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XWFRLKB) or obsidian sphere, and focus on the guidance, inspiration, or answers you seek. You can also practice scrying by asking the powers that be (or your own intuition) yes or no questions with a crystal pendulum. 13. Meditate. Divination not your thing? That's okay\u2014meditation can have the same effect. Put on some calming music, light a few candles, sit down, and focus. You can [meditate under the full moon](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g25178771/best-meditation-apps/) in order to pinpoint the aspects of your life you want to transform. Ask yourself what it is you want to let go of, and what you want to manifest. Practice visualization. Repeat [mantras that make you feel powerful](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a35354813/vision-board-quotes/). You can take a few minutes to simply meditate on the zodiac sign the moon is in, what that means for you, and how to embody its energy, suggests Hadas. \"When you know the myth of the various signs or what their energy is, then you can really find a purpose in working with them,\" says Hadas. 14. Step outside. Yep, your full moon ritual can be as simple as going outside. \"If you go out at night during a full moon, it casts this beautiful snow-like light on everything. Just [going out for a walk](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g23517576/best-walking-shoes-for-women/) to connect at that simplest level [can be a ritual],\" says Hadas. \"Work with the energy of the place you're in, even if it's not the middle of the woods. You can still use all that stimuli to inform your magickal practice,\" adds Kelly. \"If you're in a city, really tap in to see what is the movement and the rhythm of the city and the people in the city telling you and how can that inform your practice.\" 15. Craft a spell jar. It's arts and crafts time! The full moon is the perfect time to let your creativity run free. One of the best ways to do this is by making a spell jar or sachet. All you need is an empty container of your choosing, and herbs that represent the spell you want to cast. Since the full moon is when you may feel at your most powerful, you can make a spell jar for any intention\u2014maybe you need a sachet to hang over your bed [to invite sweet dreams](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a41106925/what-do-dreams-mean/), or a spell jar to keep by your front door to protect your home. You can also make a simple spell jar for any and every full moon. Use herbs like jasmine and anise that are associated with the full moon, or objects that represent the sign the moon is in. Add tokens from nature, small charms, and never forget the glitter. 16. Make a crystal grid. A crystal grid is another way to get creative under the full moon, says Hadas. Arrange all of your crystals, specifically those that represent what you want to manifest, into beautiful geometric patterns while visualizing your intentions. Include stones like moonstone and selenite specifically, as these represent the unique balancing powers of the moon. Then, set it up on your altar, in your living room, or outside under the guiding light of the moon herself. You may even choose to lay the crystals on your own body. \"It's a great way to heal and bring in a new vibration,\" says Hadas. 17. Cleanse your home. \"The moon is associated with the Cancer [zodiac] sign as well as the fourth house,\" says Hadas. This means the moon is aligned with nurturing energy and the home. Therefore, the full moon is the perfect time to cleanse your space. You can quite literally clean, but to add more magick into your practice, you can also cleanse your space with smoke or water. Make salt water and use a rosemary sprig to fling the water counterclockwise around your home to dispel negative energy, suggests Hadas. You can also make an aromatic mist containing herbs and essential oils related to the moon. Once you dispel the negativity from your home, spray that same water clockwise around your space to bring in positive energy. 18. Do an energy cleanse. Your home isn't the only thing that could use some cleansing under the full moon. \"For a lot of people, the moon is connected to their empathic intuition,\" Hadas notes. You hold tension in your body, and part of the transformation that occurs with the full moon ought to include releasing that tension. Much like cleansing your home, you can do an energy cleanse with smoke, water, or crystals. The key is to visualize the negativity, stress, and trauma leaving your body while imagining the light and power of the full moon entering your body in order to start anew. 19. Journal. \"I like to journal a lot, reflecting on what's going on in my life,\" says Hadas. Use the full moon as your time to write down everything that is no longer serving you, everything you want to release. Reflect on the past moon cycle and [make note of your gratitude](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/g34905327/best-gratitude-journals/). Then, make lists of your goals. Put the pen to paper and write down everything you can do [to manifest and achieve](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a39518396/369-manifestation-method/) those goals. 20. Move your body. Dancing naked under the full moon is no myth. Okay, so you don't have to dance naked, but an excellent way to get in touch with the spirit of the moon, the divine feminine, and your own inner witch is to move your body under the light of the lunation, says Hadas. Dance with your friends outside or have a party for one in the comfort of your own room. Feel the power of the moon flow through with every movement\u2014this simple act of joy alone can be your full moon ritual. Dancing not your jive? Many will also [practice yoga and stretching](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g24033579/yoga-poses-for-beginners/) under the full moon to release tension and dispel negativity from their body. 21. Charge your magickal tools. Because the full moon is so powerful, it is the perfect time to charge your magickal tools. You may choose to set your crystals, journal, candles or oils, and herbs under the full moon so they can better aid you in your magickal practice. Don't practice magick? You can still do this ritual! If you have a piece of jewelry or talisman you carry with you or that makes you feel safe and confident, charge it under the light of the full moon and let its power grow. 22. Practice breathwork. Harnessing full moon magick is as easy as breathing. Because the full moon is a transformation, it offers a great reset-a time to be rid of the old and welcome the new. And breathing is just about the best thing you can do to take care of yourself during this special period. \"Breathe in healing light and energy, and exhale out what you want to get rid of,\" suggests Hadas. \"When you start to feel where emotion is kept in your body, you can breathe in the moonlight to those places and exhale negativity.\" The power of the full moon is yours to work with in whatever way you see fit, but at the end of the day, er, night, each full moon ritual is your deserved opportunity for radical acts of self-care.
