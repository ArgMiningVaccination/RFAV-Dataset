The History of Sacred Rose Healing As the story goes, this healing modality was channeled by a man in Mexico who was grieving the imminent loss of his son to a terminal illness. After persistent prayers to the patron saint, he was guided to hold roses above the boy's body. They each swung wildly, signaling to the man that he should lay them there. Upon waking the next morning, he saw his son playing in the room and completely healed, while the roses were on the ground shriveled up. They soaked up the illness and negative energy throughout the night! In 2019, Sacred Rose Healing was brought to the United States by two beautiful healers who trained me in this powerful healing modality. Now, I'm thrilled to be able to train you in this essential rose healing course. From some of our past students: \"I'm super excited to have completed certification for Sacred Rose Healing.
