[ Read More ](#/staff_member/5/bio) My name is Jasmine Villarreal and I am a licensed acupuncture therapist in the states of North and South Carolina and am certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM). Upon completion of classical training in Chinese acupuncture and herbal medicine and a two year clinical internship, I received my Master's degree from Daoist Traditions College of Chinese Medical Arts. Additionally, I hold a Bachelor's degree in general psychology from the University of North Carolina at Asheville. After completion of my undergraduate degree, I worked as an autism support professional for the Autism Society of North Carolina for four years until I was inspired to pursue higher education in integrative health care beginning in 2017. My various educational and clinical experiences have given me an affinity for working with many conditions including but not limited to GI disturbances, women's health, stress and anxiety, autoimmune disorders, and chronic pain. In treatment sessions, a combination of modern and ancient techniques including acupuncture, adjunctive therapies like cupping and gut sha, and herbal medicine are utilized to provide optimal results for each individual. I believe that balance and harmony are key to good health. I seek to nurture these qualities within the health of each patient as well as my own. I believe that a deeper knowledge and understanding of our bodies', both in states of balance and imbalance, can connect us to greater states of well-being. I encourage these ideas in treatment sessions through education, bodywork, mindfulness and reflectiveness to illuminate new paths for positive change. I look forward to working with you helping you attain your healing goals at Carolina Family Acupuncture! Outside of the clinic, you can find me, listening to music, dancing, taking long walks, practicing yoga, cooking, learning something new, spending time in nature, and spending quality time with family and friends.
