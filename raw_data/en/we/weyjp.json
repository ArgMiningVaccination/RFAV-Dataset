The sound usually lasts only a few minutes. Ringing in the ears that does not get better or go away is called [tinnitus](/ringing-ears-tinnitus). You may hear a sound, such as a ringing or roaring, that does not come from your surroundings (nobody else can hear it). The sound may keep time with your heartbeat, it may keep pace with your breathing, it may be constant, or it may come and go. Tinnitus is most common in people older than age 40. Men have problems with tinnitus more often than women. - See a picture of the ear. There are two main types of tinnitus. - Pulsatile (like a heartbeat) tinnitus is often caused by sounds created by muscle movements near the ear, changes in the ear canal, or blood flow (vascular) problems in the face or neck. You may hear sounds such as your own pulse or the contractions of your muscles. - Non-pulsatile tinnitus is caused by problems in the nerves involved with hearing. You may hear sounds in one or both ears. Sometimes this type of tinnitus is described as coming from inside the head. The most common cause of tinnitus is hearing loss that occurs with aging ( [presbycusis](/age-related-hearing-loss-presbycusis)), but it can also be caused by living or working around loud noises ( [acoustic trauma](/health-topics/noise-induced-hearing-loss)). Tinnitus can occur with all types of hearing loss and may be a symptom of almost any ear disorder. Other possible causes of tinnitus include: - A buildup of [earwax](/earwax). - [Medicines](/health-topics/medicines-can-cause-tinnitus), especially antibiotics or large amounts of aspirin. - Drinking an excessive amount of alcohol or caffeinated beverages. - Ear infections or [eardrum rupture](/ruptured-perforated-eardrum). - Dental or other problems affecting the mouth, such as [temporomandibular (TM) problems](/temporomandibular-disorders-tmds). - Injuries, such as whiplash or a direct blow to the ear or head. - Injury to the inner ear following surgery or radiation therapy to the head or neck. - A rapid change in environmental pressure (barotrauma). - Severe weight loss from malnutrition or excessive dieting. - Repeated exercise with the neck in a hyperextended position, such as when bicycle riding. - Blood flow (vascular) problems, such as [carotid atherosclerosis](/atherosclerosis-0), [arteriovenous (AV) malformations](/arteriovenous-malformation), and [high blood pressure](/high-blood-pressure-hypertension)(hypertension). - Nerve problems (neurologic disorders), such as multiple sclerosis or migraine headache. - Other diseases. These may include: - [Acoustic - - [Thyroid](/thyroid-gland)disease. - Most tinnitus that comes and goes does not require medical treatment. You may need to see your doctor if tinnitus occurs with other symptoms, does not get better or go away, or is in only one ear. There may not be a cure for tinnitus, but your doctor can help you learn how to live with the problem and make sure a more serious problem is not causing your symptoms. [Check your symptoms](/health-topics/ringing-ears-tinnitus) to decide if and when you should see a doctor. Check Your Symptoms The medical assessment of symptoms is based on the body parts you have. - If you are transgender or non-binary, choose the sex that matches the body parts (such as ovaries, testes, prostate, breasts, penis, or vagina) you now have in the area where you are having symptoms. - If your symptoms aren't related to those organs, you can choose the gender you identify with. - If you have some organs of both sexes, you may need to go through this triage tool twice (once as \"male\" and once as \"female\"). This will make sure that the tool asks the right questions for you. [vertigo](#tf7099)? [medicine](#tf7101)may be causing the ringing in your ears? Many things can affect how your body responds to a symptom and what kind of care you may need. These include: - Your age. Babies and older adults tend to get sicker quicker. - Your overall health. If you have a condition such as diabetes, HIV, cancer, or heart disease, you may need to pay closer attention to certain symptoms and seek care sooner. - Medicines you take. Certain medicines, such as blood thinners (anticoagulants), medicines that suppress the immune system like steroids or chemotherapy, or natural health products can cause symptoms or make them worse. - Recent health events, such as surgery or injury. These kinds of events can cause symptoms afterwards or make them more serious. - Your health habits and lifestyle, such as eating and exercise habits, smoking, alcohol or drug use, sexual history, and travel. Try Home Treatment You have answered all the questions. Based on your answers, you may be able to take care of this problem at home. - Try home treatment to relieve the symptoms. - Call your doctor if symptoms get worse or you have any concerns (for example, if symptoms are not getting better as you would expect). You may need care sooner. Many prescription and non-prescription medicines can cause ringing in the ears (tinnitus). A few examples are: - ASA, ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin), and naproxen (such as Aleve). - Some blood pressure and heart medicines. - Some antidepressants. - Some cancer medicines.

Home Treatment The following tips may help you reduce symptoms of tinnitus. - Cut back on or stop drinking alcohol and beverages containing caffeine. - Stop smoking and stop using smokeless tobacco products. Nicotine use makes tinnitus worse by reducing blood flow to the structures of the ear. - Limit your use of [aspirin](/health-topics/aspirin-pain-fever-and-inflammation), products containing aspirin, and other [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)](/health-topics/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids)such as ibuprofen or naproxen. - Exercise regularly. Exercise improves blood flow to the structures of the ear. But avoid extended periods of exercise, such as bicycle riding, that keep your neck in a hyperextended position. For more information, see the topic [Fitness: Getting and Staying Active](/health-topics/fitness-getting-and-staying-active). While waiting to see whether tinnitus goes away, or if your doctor has advised you that your tinnitus will be present for a long time, try these methods to cope with the constant noise: - Limit or avoid exposure to the noises you suspect are causing your tinnitus. If you cannot avoid loud noises, wear protective earplugs or earmuffs. - Try to ignore the sound by directing your attention to other things. - Practice relaxation techniques, such as biofeedback, [meditation](/health-topics/meditation), or yoga. Stress and fatigue seem to make tinnitus worse. - Quiet rooms can cause tinnitus to seem more distracting. Background noise may reduce the amount of noise you hear. Play music or [white noise](/white-noise)when you are trying to fall asleep or anytime you find yourself in a quiet place. Try using a fan, a humidifier, or a machine that makes soothing sounds such as ocean waves. - Try the herbal supplement ginkgo biloba. Some studies suggest that it may help relieve tinnitus, but other studies do not show a benefit. Further studies are needed to determine the best dosage. Symptoms to watch for during home treatment [Call your doctor](/health-topics/ringing-ears-tinnitus) if any of the following occur during home treatment: - Symptoms develop that are related to nerve damage, such as loss of coordination or numbness or weakness on one side of the face or one side of the body. - Other symptoms develop, such as significant hearing loss, [vertigo](/vertigo), loss of balance, nausea or vomiting. - Tinnitus localizes to one ear. - Hearing loss becomes worse after an ear injury, or tinnitus or hearing loss does not improve. - Tinnitus continues for more than a week. - Your symptoms become more severe or more frequent. Prevention You may be able to prevent ringing in the ears if you: - Limit or avoid exposure to loud noises, such as music, power tools, gunshots, and industrial machinery. - Wear protective earplugs or earmuffs if you cannot avoid loud noises. Do not use wadded-up tissue or cotton balls. These do not protect adequately against loud noises, especially the more dangerous high frequencies, and they may become lodged in the ear canal. - Be careful when using stereo headphones. If music is so loud that others can hear it clearly or you can't hear other sounds around you, the volume is too high. - Cut back on or stop drinking alcohol and beverages containing caffeine. - Do not smoke or use smokeless tobacco products. Nicotine use may cause tinnitus by reducing blood flow to the structures of the ear. For more information, see the topic [Quitting Smoking](/health-topics/quitting-smoking-0). - Exercise regularly. Exercise may prevent tinnitus because it improves blood flow to the structures of the ear. For more information, see the topic [Fitness:Getting and Staying Active](/health-topics/fitness-getting-and-staying-active). - Maintain a healthy weight. Tinnitus occurs more frequently in obese adults. For more information, see the topic [Weight Management](/healthy-eating-physical-activity/healthy-weights/weight-management). Preparing For Your Appointment To prepare for your appointment, see the topic [ Making the Most of Your Appointment](/health-topics/making-most-your-appointment).
