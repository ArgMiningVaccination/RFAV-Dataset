Herbal Therapy is a central part of Oriental Medicine and the decision of what formula is right for you is based on the same principals of physiology and pathology as your Acupuncture treatment plan. All of the formulas we carry are in either pill or liquid form. These formulas are available only by prescription from a health professional with additional training in herbal medicine. We only provide herbal prescriptions to patients who have been seen by one of our practitioners. "}
