Post-procedure, you must follow a clean eating plan, exercise regularly, and attend regular follow-up appointments with your Batash Endoscopic Weight Loss Center nutrition team to ensure long-standing success. What Is A Clean Eating Diet Plan? Although there are many variations of \"clean eating\" this term means eating whole foods that are close to their natural state, cooking from scratch, and avoiding processed foods. A clean eating diet plan provides balanced nourishment for your body because they are full of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that are essential to your health. In addition to supporting the health of your heart and boosting your immune system, adopting a clean eating plan for weight loss will help you reach and maintain your goals. Calories that Count and Counting Calories You will need to eat certain types and quantities of food to lose weight safely and keep it off. First, following your post-op dietary guidelines will allow your stomach a chance to heal and prevent side effects or complications from the treatment. Our best-in-class [OnTrack](/complimentary-coaching-monitoring/) Nutritional Counseling and Lifestyle Coaching Program will help you form new behaviors and habits that will promote weight loss and a healthier lifestyle. You will begin to get comfortable choosing the types of food you should eat and how much constitutes a serving. You will feel great in body and mind as you continue to develop better eating habits choosing nutrient-dense calories that benefit your well-being and give you energy so you enjoy physical activity and exercise. Very quickly you will begin to see the benefits of eating clean and avoiding processed foods that contain ingredients such as dyes, preservatives, sodium, fat, sugar, and other additives that your body was not designed to process. Most patients begin to taste the difference in their food once they begin eating whole foods and the processed junk loses its appeal. Empty Vs Nutrient-Dense Calories Many foods that are marketed to Americans do not provide any natural nutritional value. Most of us eat them because they are convenient, we are bored, or they taste good. Clean eating does not support these types of foods and they should be avoided. The top twelve types of food you should avoid, because they do not offer enough nutritional value or are hard on the digestive system, include: - Junk food - candy, chips, pretzels, etc.; - Fast food - French fries, hamburgers, etc.; - Dry foods - granola, dry cereal, etc.; - Processed carbohydrates - rice, bread, pasta, pastries, etc.; - Fatty foods - bacon, sausage, cream, butter, etc.; - Tough and processed meats - steak, pork chops, hotdogs, ham, etc.; - Overly fibrous fruits and vegetables - corn, celery, etc.; - Spicy or heavily seasoned foods; - Microwave dinners; - Highly caffeinated or sweetened beverages - energy drinks, soda, certain fruit juices, etc.; - Carbonated beverages; - Alcohol. While this list of omissions to your diet may seem daunting at first, you will soon get used to living without these unhealthy food choices and learn to enjoy the healthy ones. Most likely, you will begin to feel so great that you will not care about the transition at all. Monitor Your Progress Is all this information overwhelming? Don't worry!
