Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Cigna / ASH Medical Coverage Policies are based. In the event of a conflict, a customer's bene fit plan document always supersedes the information in the Cigna / ASH Medical Coverage Policy. In the absence of a contr olling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Determinati ons in each specific instance may require consideration of: 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service 2) any applicable laws/regulations 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Cigna-ASH Medical Coverage Policies and 4) the specific facts of the particular situation Cigna / ASH Medical Coverage Policies rel ate exclusively to the administration of health benefit plans. Cigna / ASH Medical Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment guidelines. Some information in these Coverage Policies may not apply to all benefit plans administered by Cigna. Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make benefit determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and benefit determinations do not apply to those clients. Acupuncture is subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of the benefits as described in the applicable plan's schedule of copayments. Please refer to the applicable benefit plan document to determine benefit availability and the terms and conditions of coverage.

DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 3 of 32 Acupuncture is a form of complementary and alternative medicine that has been widely practiced for many centuries. It involves the stimulation of specific anatomical locations on the skin through the penetration of fine needles, with the goal of relieving pain or treating disease. Stimulation can be accomplished manually (i.e., by a twisting motion of the hand) or through such methods as electrical stimulation (i.e., electroacupuncture). The practice of traditional acupuncture is predicated upon several fundamental underlying principles. It is predicated upon the existence of a series of meridians that course through the body along which are located discrete points that correspond to specific organs and/or have particular clinical significance. A vital energ y, \"chi,\" flows through the meridians and the acupuncture points and regulating bodily functions. It is the disruption of this flow of energy that therapeutic acupuncture is said to address. Acupuncture typically utilizes unique diagnostic procedures to evaluate the meridian/chi system. This includes an evaluation of the patient's chief complaint and related health status through standardized diagnostic interviewing and examination techniques. Interviews are based on the traditional Ten Questions and exam inations include, but are not limited to, evaluation of meridians, points, general vitality and behavior, the radial pulses and the tongue. Based upon the patient's complaint and the findings of these diagnostic procedures, individualized treatment regimens are developed that specify treatment variables such as the acupuncture points to be utilized, needle placement, and type of needle stimulation. A majority of states provide licensure or registration for acupuncture practitioners, although the scope of pr actice allowed under state requirements varies. Depending upon the jurisdiction, those licensed to administer acupuncture may include licensed acupuncturists (LAc), medical/osteopathic physicians (MD/DO), (DPM), dentists (DDS/DMD), nurse practitioners (NP), physician assistants (PA), as well as other designated health care providers. Depending upon the practitioner's training, different systems of acupuncture diagnosis and tr eatment may be used. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Panel and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) consider acupuncture safe when performed by qualified practitioners using sterile needles. The FDA requires that sterile, nontoxic needles be used and that they be labeled for single use by qualified practitioners. Acupuncture appears to be a relatively safe treatment with rare serious adverse side effects when performed by qualified practitioners who consistently adhere to the recomm endations of the FDA regarding the use of sterile needles. Depending on the pain condition being treated, a course of acupuncture may last several weeks. Although there is no consensus in the scientific literature regarding the optimal number of acupunctur e treatments to administer or the duration of treatment for any condition, in general, there should be a reasonable expectation for clinical improvement. If no improvement is documented after an initial trial of two- four weeks treatment, an alternative treatment plan should be considered. If lack of clinical improvement continues following subsequent treatments re-evaluation by the referring provider may be indicated. If measurable objective improvement is made, then progress towards identified goals should be clearly documented and the treatment plan updated accordingly. The necessity of continued care beyond a therapeutic trial is dependent upon objective evidence of improvement (i.e., functional gain). Multiple different biological mechanisms have been pr oposed and studied to explain acupuncture. All of these proposed mechanisms are centrally mediated and not merely local physiologic responses. Most commonly it is thought that the stimulation of the acupuncture needle triggers the release of endogenous opi oids (endorphins). This effect seems the most pronounced in electro- acupuncture. Another possible mechanism is through the diffuse noxious inhibitory control pathway (DNIC). According to DNIC, a noxious stimulus applied to any region of the body can induce immediate suppression of pain transmission in neurons of the trigeminal caudalis and/or the spinal dorsal horn. Another theory proposes that the descending serotoninergic inhibitory pathway is key to acupuncture analgesia. In addition, there is some preli minary evidence that acupuncture may have effects on the inflammatory response mediated through the autonomic nervous system. Current available evidence indicates that insertion of acupuncture needles has an effect above waiting list controls but there is limited available evidence to define whether exact needle placement on established \"Traditional\" Acupuncture points is necessary to produce a result. None of the mechanisms of action postulated for acupuncture affects are sufficiently well understood to ha ve established a dispositive answer to describe the exact physiological mechanism by which acupuncture produces its analgesic and antiemetic effects. Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 4 of 32 Acup uncture Point Injection Therapy: Acupuncture point injection therapy is a procedure where pharmaceuti cals and natural biologic products such as vitamins, herbal extracts and other homeopathics, are injected into the body at acupuncture points to prevent or treat disease. One solution in particular, isotonic saline, when injected theoretically allows activation of the acupuncture point for a longer period of time enhancing the therapeutic effect. DOCUMENTATION GUIDELINES Evaluation: An initial evaluation service is essential to determine whether any acupuncture services are medically necessary, to gather baseline data, establish a treatment plan, and develop goals based on the data. The initial evaluation service must include: An appropriate level of clinical history, examination, and medical decision- making relevant and appropriate to the individual' s com plaint(s) and presentation; Subjective historical evaluation based on standardize method such as the 10 questions; Specific standardized and non- standardized tests, assessments, and tools; Interpretation and synthesis of all relevant clinical findings derived from history and physical examination for the purpose of clinical decision- making; Subjective and objective measurable, description of functional status using comparable and consistent methods; Summary of clinical reasoning and consideration of contextual factors with recommendations; The establishment of a working diagnosis; Plan of care with specific treatment techniques or activities to be used in treatment sessions that should be updated as the individual's condition changes; Frequency and duration of treatment (treatment dose); Functional, measurable, and time- framed long- term and short -term goals based on appropriate and relevant evaluation data; and Prognosis and discharge plan. Treatment Sessions : Acupuncture treatment can vary from Acupuncture alone (CPT codes 97810, 97811, 97813, 97814) to the use of a variety of modalities and procedures depending on the patient's condition, response to care, and treatment tolerance. All services must be supported in the treatment plan and be based on an individual's clinical condition. An acupuncture treatment session may include: A brief evaluation of the patient's progress and response to previous treatment(s); Acupuncture with or without electric stimulation Related passive modalities (e.g.: indirect moxibustion, hot/cold packs Functional education in self -care and home management Reassessment of the individual's condition, diagnosis, plan, and goals as part of the treatment session Coordination, communication, and documentation Reevaluation, if there is a significant change in the individual's condition or there is a need to update and modify the treatment plan Docum entation of treatment sessions should include at a minimum: Date of treatment Specific treatment(s) provided that match the procedure codes billed Total treatment time The individual's response to treatment Skilled ongoing reassessment of the individual's progress toward the goals Any progress toward the goals in objective, measurable terms using consistent and comparable methods Any barriers to expected progress or changes to the plan of care Name and credentials of the treating clinician Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 5 of 32 Measuring Progress in Acupuncture: Monitoring for clinically significant changes in historical/examination findings and functional status including, but not limited to: Pain level per VAS 1- 10 scale and Frequency of symptoms Reported interference with daily functional activities Validated Functional Outcome Measures specific for condition (Clinically significant therapeutic progress (MCID, improvement in pain, impairments and objective evaluation findings) Length of time of relief after treatment rendered Monitoring for significant changes in reported patient medication or other resource utilization Tenderness on palpation Range of motion Observation (e.g. behavior, mobility, appearance of affected area) Barriers to expected progress (e.g.: co -morbid conditions, extremes of age, socio-economic factors) Acupuncture Treatment Service: The Acupuncture service includes a brief assessment of the patient's condition, as well as documentation of the patient's response to the treatment. A reevaluation (an Established Patient E/M service) is indicated when services above and beyond the usual pre -service and post -service work associated with the acupuncture services is required. This may include circumstances where there are new clinical findings , a rapid change in the individual's status, or failure to respond to treatment interventions. The E/M services may include all or some of the components of the initial evaluation, such as: Data collection with objective measurements taken based on appropriate and relevant assessment tests and tools using comparable and consistent methods; Clinical decision -making as to whether acupuncture care is still indicated; Organizing the composite of current health conditions and deciding a priority/focus of tr eatment; Identifying the appropriate intervention(s) for new or ongoing goal achievement; Modification of intervention(s); Revision in plan of care if needed; Evaluation of any meaningful changes in function; Deciphering effectiveness of intervention(s); and Updating the discharge plan as appropriate. Standardized Tests and Measures/Func tional Outcome Measures (FOMs): Measuring outcomes is an important component of an acupuncturist's practice. Outcome measures are important in direct management of individual patient care and for the opportunity they provide the profession in collectively comparing care and determining effectiveness. The use of standardized tests and measures early in an episode of care establishes the baseline status of the patient, providing a means to quantify change in the patient's functioning. Outcome measures, along with other standardized tests and measures used throughout the episode of care provide information about whether predicted outcomes are being realized. As the patient reaches the termination of acupuncture services and the end of the episode of care, the acupuncturist, again, measures the outcomes of their services. Standardize d outcome measures provide a common language with which to evaluate the success of interventions, thereby providing a basis for comparing outcomes related to different intervention approaches. Measuring outcomes of care within the relevant components of function (including body functions and structures), activity, and participation, among patients with the same diagnosis, is the foundation for determining which intervention approaches comprise best clinical practice. LITERATURE REVIEW Acupuncture: The clin ical utility of acupuncture is widely debated. Evaluating the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in the context of clinical trials is challenging primarily because of the difficulty of designing randomized trials with appropriate blinding of both subjects and providers. Many studies lack appropriate controls, adequate study size, randomization and/or consistent outcome measures. Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 6 of 32 Study controls for comparing real acupuncture (also referred to as verum acupuncture) typically include a placebo, sham acupunctur e, standard treatment, or no treatment. Sham acupuncture is the most often used control in studies evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture. However, there is no standardized method for employing sham acupuncture and no consensus on needle placement, making it difficult to generalize findings across studies. The goal of applying sham acupuncture is to refrain from stimulating acupuncture points. In many studies, sham is done at irrelevant acupuncture sites; however, evidence has shown sham acupuncture evokes physiological responses. Because the evidence suggests that sham acupuncture is not truly a physiologically neutral event, its use as a control in clinical trials is debatable. It is difficult to distinguish between the specific effects of treatment versus that of the placebo. It has been reported that the ratio of improvement in sham groups was substantially higher than in truly inert placebo groups (Madsen, et al., 2009; Ezzo, et al., 2000). Although initially believed to have no effect, some researchers contend that needle placement in any position invokes a biological response that may interfere with the interpretation of findings. There are now several thousand RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture for hundreds of different conditions. The li terature is examined below. Chronic Pain: Vickers et al. conducted a meta- analysis of trials of acupuncture for chronic pain (Vickers et al., 2012). Eligible trials included those for mechanical low back and neck pain, shoulder pain, headache and osteoart hritis. Study subjects were required to have had pain for a minimum of four weeks and be followed for at least four weeks after the end of treatment. There were no restrictions on what outcomes measures could be used. The analysis identified 29 trials that met these criteria with a total of 17,922 individual patients analyzed. The analysis found acupuncture to be superior to both sham and no acupuncture control for each of the four conditions studied (all p<0.001). The effect sizes were similar across all p ain conditions. Patients receiving acupuncture had less pain, with scores 0.23 and 0.15 standard deviations lower than sham controls for back and neck pain, osteoarthritis, and chronic headache respectively; the effect sizes in comparison to no acupuncture controls were 0.55, 0.57 and 0.42. It is worth noting that the differences between acupuncture and sham are quite modest when compared to the differences between acupuncture and no acupuncture. Sensitivity analyses including for publication bias did not c hange these findings. The authors concluded, \"Our results from individual patient data meta -analyses of nearly 18,000 randomized patients on high quality trials provide the most robust evidence to date that acupuncture is a reasonable referral option for patients with chronic pain.\" National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline (2021) examined the literature on acupuncture and chronic pain. Findings included the following: Acupuncture versus sham acupuncture Pain reduction Very low quality evidence from 13 studies with 1230 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture at 3 months. Low quality evidence from 2 studies with 159 participants showed a clinically important benefi t of acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture at 3 months. Low quality evidence from 4 studies with 376 participants showed no clinically important difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture at >3 months.

Low quality evidence from 1 study with 61 participants showed no clinically important difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture at >3 months Quality of life Low to moderate quality evidence from 2 studies with 210 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture at 3 months. Moderate quality evidence from 1 study with 158 participants showed sham acupuncture to have a clinically important improvement compared to acupuncture at 3 months. Very low quality evidence from 3 studies with 244 participants showed no clinically important difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture at 3 months. Very low quality evidence from 2 studies with 168 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture at 3 months. Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 7 of 32 Very low to low quality evidence from 1 study with 178 participants showed a cli nically important benefit, clinically important harm and no clinically important difference of acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture at 3 months (various quality of life subscales). Moderate quality evidence from 2 studies with 159 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture at 3 months. Low quality evidence from 1 study with 72 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture at 3 months. Very low qual ity evidence from 1 study with 76 participants showed a clinically important benefit of sham acupuncture compared to verum acupuncture at >3 months.

Low quality evidence from 1 study with 153 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture at >3 months. Moderate quality evidence from 1 study with 159 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture at >3 months. Physical function Very low quality evidence from 1 study with 118 participants showed no clinically important difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture at 3 months. Very low quality evidence from 1 study with 106 participants showed no clinically important difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture at >3 months. Acupuncture versus usual care Pain reduction Low quality evidence from 5 studies with 234 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to usual care at 3 months. Low quality evidence from 2 studies with 384 participants showed no clinically important difference between acupuncture and usual care at 3 months. Moderate quality evidence from 1 study with 3162 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to usual care at 3 months. Moderate quality evidence from 1 study with 344 participants s howed no clinically important difference between acupuncture and usual care at >3 months. Quality of life Moderate quality evidence from 1 study with 3213 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to usual care at 3 months . Very low quality evidence from 1 study with 100 participants showed both a clinically important benefit and no clinically important difference between acupuncture and usual care at 3 months (various quality of life subscales). Low quality evidence from 1 study with 204 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to usual care at >3 months. Physical function Very low quality evidence from 1 study with 45 participants showed no clinically important difference between acupunct ure and usual care at 3 months. Very low quality evidence from 1 study with 100 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to usual care at 3 months. Pain self -efficacy Very low quality evidence from 1 study with 294 par ticipants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to usual care at 3 months. Pain interference Very low quality evidence from 1 study with 100 participants showed a clinically important benefit of acupuncture compared to usual care at >3 months. Nielsen et al. (2022) updated the evidence base for acupuncture therapy for acute pain with a review of systematic reviews and meta -analyses on postsurgical/perioperative pain with opioid sparing and acute nonsurgical/trauma pain, including a cute pain in the emergency department. There are 22 systematic reviews, 17 with meta -analyses of acupuncture in acute pain settings, and a review for acute pain in the intensive care unit. There are additional studies of acupuncture in acute pain settings. The majority of reviews found acupuncture therapy to be an efficacious strategy for acute pain, with potential to avoid or reduce opioid Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 8 of 32 reliance. Future multicenter trials are needed to clarify the dosage and generalizability of acupuncture for acute pain in the emergency department. With an extremely low risk profile, acupuncture therapy is an important strategy in comprehensive acute pain care. Osteoarthritis: A Cochrane Review of acupuncture for peripheral joint arthritis identified sixteen trials (3498 individual patients) of adequate quality for review (Manheimer et al., 2010). Twelve of these trials included only people with OA of the knee, three were for OA of the hip and one trial included both hip and knee. Acupuncture showed statistica lly significant, short term improvements in OA pain and function. However these differences were not considered to be clinically significant. Using only studies with sham controls deemed adequate to blind participants, these differences were small and not statistically significant. On a pain scale of 0- 20, these differences were in the range of 3- 4 points. On a functional scale of 0- 68, improvements ranged from 3 to 11 points. However, greater effects were seen when compared to waiting list controls. The ov erall conclusion was that at both 8 and 26 week end points, acupuncture offered small benefits in pain and function. These benefits were deemed to be at least partially due to non- specific treatment effects. Atalay et al. (2021) sought to determine the eff ect of acupuncture treatment and physiotherapy on pain, physical function, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). One hundred patients with KOA were randomly divided into the acupuncture group and the physiotherapy group. Bot h treatments were given in 12 sessions over 6 weeks. Thirteen acupuncture points were selected for the knee. Local points were GB34, defined as KI3, SP6, LI4, and ST41. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain intensity. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the 36- Item Short Form Health Survey (SF -36) were used to determine functional status and health- related QOL, res pectively. All patients were evaluated at baseline, after the last treatment, and at the 12- week follow -up period. There was no statistically significant difference between the acupuncture group and physiotherapy group in terms of pain, total WOMAC, and SF -36 levels at baseline, after treatment, and at the 12th week after treatment (P > 0.05). Both treatments significantly improved functional status and decreased the level of pain assessed by VAS at the 12- week follow -up of the study. There was no adverse advent related to therapeutic methods. Authors concluded that the acupuncture and physiotherapy performed twice weekly for 6 weeks have similar effects with regard to pain, functional status, and QOL. There were no significant differences between the acupun cture and physiotherapy groups in relief of pain, improved functional status, and QOL in the treatment of KOA. Both acupuncture and physiotherapy treatments were found to yield significantly superior results when compared with baseline values. Tian et al. (2022) evaluated the efficacy of acupuncture for knee OA (KOA) patients and calculate the required information size (RIS) to determine whether further clinical studies are required. Eleven RCTs with 2484 patients were included in our meta -analysis, meeting the inclusion criteria for the meta- analysis. The meta- analysis indicated that acupuncture had a beneficial effect on knee osteoarthrit is in reducing pain and improving patient 's function al activities, but true acupuncture showed no significant effect in relief of patient's stiffness . No significant difference in improving the quality life of mental and physical health compared with sham acupuncture was found. Authors concluded that acupuncture has a beneficial effect on pain relief and improves functional activities, and this treatment can be recommended as a beneficial alternative therapy in patients with KOA, particularly for chronic patients and those currently undergoing long -term pain, and help them to increase their quality of life. Lin et al. (2022) systematically evaluated the efficacy and safety effectiveness of acupuncture inactivation of myofascial pain trigger points in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. A total of 724 patients from 9 RCTs were finally included, and the results of met a-analysis showed that the acupuncture myofascial pain trigger point group was better than the control group in terms of total effective rate, cure rate, VAS score, Lysholm score, and WOMAC score. Authors concluded that the efficacy and safety of acupuncturing myofascial pain trigger points in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis is positive, but due to the limited number of literature included in this study and the low quality of the included literature, there is still a need for high -quality and large sam ple size RCTs for the analysis of this treatment option. Headache: Linde et al. conducted a Cochrane Review of acupuncture for tension -type headaches (Linde et al., 2009). Eleven trials with 2317 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Two of the trials compa red acupuncture to routine care (including self -care) and found clinically and statistically significant benefits to acupuncture for both Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 9 of 32 headache frequency and pain intensity. In these two trials 47% of patients receiving acupuncture reported a decrease i n the number of headache days by at least 50%, compared to 16% of patients in the control groups. Six of the trials compared acupuncture to some form of sham acupuncture where needle placement was not guided by any specific acupuncture findings. In this comparison, 50% of the \"true\" acupuncture patients experienced a greater than 50% reduction in headache pain compared to 41% in the sham controls. Three trials compared acupuncture to massage, physiotherapy, or relaxation. The methodological quality of these studies was poor and the results difficult to interpret, but overall there appeared to be a slight benefit to acupuncture compared to these interventions. A previous Cochrane review of this topic yielded inconclusive results. However, the addition of six newer trials in this review led the authors to conclude that acupuncture could be \"a valuable non- pharmacological tool in patients with frequent episodic or chronic tension- type headaches.\" Another Cochrane Review examined acupuncture for migraine headache prophylaxis (Linde et al., 2009). Twenty -two trials with 4419 participants met the inclusion criteria. Six of the trials compared acupuncture to no treatment or routine care. The acupunctur e care resulted in fewer headaches than in the controls over 3 -4 months. One of the trials followed patients for nine months and the treatment effects were undiminished. Fourteen trials compared acupuncture to some form of sham intervention. The results of single trials varied considerably, but the pooled results did not show any clinically or statistically significant benefit to the \"true\" acupuncture. Four trials compared acupuncture to drug prophylaxis and demonstrated slightly better outcomes and fewer side effects in the acupuncture groups. Overall the authors conclude that acupuncture should be considered a valid treatment option for migraine prophylaxis. Turkistani et al. (2021) evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture and manual therapy in tension -type headaches. Eight articles involving 3846 participants showed evidence that acupuncture and manual therapy can be valuable non -pharmacological treatment options for tension- type headaches. Acupuncture was compared to routine care or sham intervention. Acupuncture was not found to be superior to physiotherapy, exercise, and massage therapy. Randomized controlled trials done in various countries showed manual therapy also significantly decreased headache intensity. Manual therapy has an efficacy that equals prophylactic medication and tricyclic antidepressants in treating tension- type headaches. The available data suggests that both acupuncture and manual therapy have beneficial effects on treating symptoms of tension -type headache. However, further clini cal trials looking at long- term benefits and risks are needed. Zheng et al. (2022) examined the effectiveness of acupuncture with a follow -up period of 32 weeks. They conducted a randomized controlled trial, and 218 participants who were diagnosed with chr onic tension- type headache (CTTH). The participants in the intervention group received 20 sessions of true acupuncture (TA group) over 8 weeks. The acupuncture treatments were standardized across participants, and each acupuncture site was needled to achieve deqi sensation. Each treatment session lasted 30 minutes. The participants in the control group received the same sessions and treatment frequency of superficial acupuncture (SA group) - defined as a type of sham control by avoiding deqi sensation at each acupuncture site. A responder was defined as a participant who reported at least a 50% reduction in the monthly number of headache days (MHDs). The responder rate was 68.2% in the TA group (n=110) versus 48.1% in the SA group (n=108) at week 16; and it was 68.2% in the TA group versus 50% in the SA group at week 32. The reduction in MHDs was 13.1\u00b19.8 days in the TA group versus 8.8\u00b19.6 days in the SA group at week 16, and the reduction was 14\u00b110.5 days in the TA group versus 9.5\u00b19.3 days in the SA group at week 32. Four mild adverse events were reported; three in the TA group versus one in the SA group. Authors concluded that the 8- week TA treatment was effective for the prophylaxis of CTTH. Further studies might focus on the cost -effectiveness of the treat ment. Low Back and Neck Pain: Liu et al. examined the set of systematic reviews of acupuncture for low back pain (Liu et al., 2015). They identified 16 systematic reviews, the overall quality of which they judged to be low. They found inconclusive evidence of a benefit for acupuncture compared to a sham for acute low back pain. For chronic low back pain there was consistent evidence of a benefit for short term pain relief and functional improvement when compared to sham or to no treatment. This benefit was found both when acupuncture was used in isolation and when used as an adjunct treatment. In another AHRQ publication by Chou et al. (2016) titled Noninvasive Treatments for Low Back Pain, noted the following key points: Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 10 of 32 For acute low back pain, a systematic review found acupuncture associated with lower pain intensity versus sham acupuncture using nonpenetrating needles; three other trials reported effects consistent with these findings. One trial of sham acupuncture using penetrating needles to nonacupun cture points found no effect on pain. These were no clear effects on function in 5 trials (Strength of Evidence (SOE): low for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found acupuncture associated with lower pain intensity versus sham acupuncture (superficial needling at acupuncture or nonacupuncture points, or nonpenetrating pressure at acupuncture points) immediately at the end of treatment and at up to 12 weeks, but there were no differences in function. Four additional trials r eported results consistent with these findings (SOE: moderate for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found acupuncture associated with lower pain intensity and better function immediately after treatment versus no acupunctur e. Mean effects on pain ranged from 7 to 24 points on a 0- to 100- point scale; for function one trial reported a difference of 8 points on a 0- to 100 -point scale and the other two trials; two trials showed small or no clear differences at longer - term foll ow-up (SOE: moderate for pain and function). For acute low back pain, a systematic review found acupuncture associated with slightly greater likelihood of overall improvement versus NSAIDs at the end of treatment (SOE: low). For chronic low back pain, a s ystematic review found acupuncture associated with better pain relief and improvement in function immediately postintervention (SOE: low). Harms of acupuncture were poorly reported in the trials, though no serious adverse events were reported (SOE: low). Qaseem et al. (2017) provided clinical recommendations on noninvasive treatment of low back pain: Recommendation 1: Given that most patients with acute or subacute low back pain improve over time regardless of treatment, clinicians and patients should selec t nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat (moderate -quality evidence), massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation (low -quality evidence). (Grade: strong recommendation). Recommendation 2: For patients with chronic low back pain, clinicians and patients should initially select nonpharmacologic treatment with exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, mindfulness -based stress reduction (moderate -quality evidence), tai chi, yoga, motor control exercise, progressive relaxation, electrom yography biofeedback, low -level laser therapy, operant therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, or spinal manipulation (low -quality evidence). (Grade: strong recommendation). Chou et al. (2017) updated the 2007 American College of Physicians guideline that addressed nonpharmacologic treatment options for low back pain. New evidence was available. Authors systematically reviewed the current evidence on nonpharmacologic therapies for acute or chronic non radicular or radicular low back pain. Randomized trials of 9 nonpharmacologic options versus sham treatment, wait list, or usual care, or of 1 nonpharmacologic option versus another were included. New evidence indicated that tai chi (strength of evidence [SOE], low) and mindfulness -based stress reduction (SOE, moderate) are effective for chronic low back pain and strengthens previous findings regarding the effectiveness of yoga (SOE, moderate). Evidence continues to support the effectiveness of exercise, psychological therapies, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, spinal manipulation, massage, and acupuncture for chronic low back pain (SOE, low to moderate). Limited evidence shows that acupuncture is modestly effective for acute low back pain (SOE, low). The magnitude of pain benefits was small to moderate and generally short term; effects on function generally were smaller than effects on pain. Wong et al. (2017) authored a systematic review for the Ontario Protocol for Traffic Injury Management (OPTIMa) Collaboration. According to high- quality guidelines: (1) all patients with acute or chronic LBP should receive education, reassurance and instruction on self -management options; (2) patients with acute LBP should be encouraged to return to activity and may benefit from paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory dr ugs (NSAIDs), or spinal manipulation; (3) the management of chronic LBP may include exercise, paracetamol or NSAIDs, manual therapy, acupuncture, and multimodal rehabilitation (combined physical and psychological Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 11 of 32 treatment); and (4) patients with lumbar di sc herniation with radiculopathy may benefit from spinal manipulation. According to Tice et al. (2017), the strength of evidence appears adequate to support coverage of acupuncture, CBT, MBSR, and yoga for chronic low back pain. Evidence- based boundaries o n duration of therapy and on repetitive courses of therapy are reasonable given the potential for inappropriate overuse of services. Authors reported that there was no evidence on the concurrent use of multiple modalities, so concurrent treatment should be treated on a case- by-case basis. Xiang et al. (2017) sought to establish whether sham acupuncture (SA) or placebo acupuncture (PA) was more efficacious for reducing low back pain (LBP) than other routine treatments and to discuss whether SA or PA is appropriate for randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for LBP. Review identified 7 trials (1768 participants); all were included in the meta- analysis. They found statistically significant differences in pain reduction post -intervention between SA or PA and routine care or a waiting list, however, no significant difference was observed between SA or PA and routine care or no treatment for post -intervention function. Authors concluded that compared with routine care or a waiting list, SA or PA was more effi cacious for pain relief post -intervention. Concluding that SA or PA is appropriate for acupuncture research would be premature. Guidelines evaluating SA or PA control methods are needed to determine the specific effect of acupuncture over placebo. Mu et al . (2020) authored an updated Cochrane review. This review is a split from an earlier Cochrane review and it focuses on chronic LBP. Mu et al. (2020) assessed the effects of acupuncture compared to sham intervention, no treatment, or usual care for chronic nonspecific LBP. Authors included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for chronic nonspecific LBP in adults. They excluded RCTs that investigated LBP with a specific etiology. Trials comparing acupuncture with sham intervention, no treatment, and usual care were included. The primary outcomes were pain, back -specific functional status, and quality of life; the secondary outcomes were pain -related disability, global assessment, or adverse events. Authors included 33 studies (37 articles) with 8270 participants. The majority of studies were carried out in Europe, Asia, North and South America. Seven studies (5572 participants) conducted in Germany accounted for 67% of the participants. Sixteen trials compared acupuncture with sham intervent ion, usual care, or no treatment. Most studies had high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of the acupuncturist. A few studies were found to have high risk of detection, attrition, reporting or selection bias. Mu et al. (2020) found low -certa inty evidence (seven trials, 1403 participants) that acupuncture may relieve pain in the immediate term (up to seven days) compared to sham intervention, visual analogue scale (VAS) 0- 100). The difference did not meet the clinically important threshold of 15 points or 30% relative change. Very low -certainty evidence from five trials (1481 participants) showed that acupuncture was not more effective than sham in improving back -specific function in the immediate term; corresponding to the Hannover Function Ability Questionnaire (HFAQ, 0 to 100, higher values better) change. Three trials (1068 participants) yielded low -certainty evidence that acupuncture seemed not to be more effective clinically in the short term for quality of life; corresponding to the physi cal 12 -item Short Form Health Survey (SF -12, 0 -100, higher values better) change. The reasons for downgrading the certainty of the evidence to either low to very low were risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. We found moderate - certainty evidence that acupuncture produced greater and clinically important pain relief; (VAS, 0 to 100), and improved back function; five trials, 2960 participants; corresponding to the HFAQ change in the immediate term compared to no treatment. The evidence was downgraded to moderate certainty due to risk of bias. No studies reported on quality of life in the short term or adverse events. Low -certainty evidence (five trials, 1054 participants) suggested that acupuncture may reduce pain; not clinically important on 0 to 100 VAS), and improve back -specific function immediately after treatment; five trials, 1381 participants; corresponding to the HFAQ change compared to usual care. Moderate- certainty evidence from one trial (731 participants) found that acupuncture was more eff ective in improving physical quality of life but not mental quality of life in the short term. The certainty of evidence was downgraded to moderate to low because of risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Low -certainty evidence suggested a similar i ncidence of adverse events immediately after treatment in the acupuncture and sham intervention groups (four trials, 465 participants), and the acupuncture and usual care groups (one trial, 74 participants). The certainty of the evidence was downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision. No trial reported adverse events for acupuncture when compared to no treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events in the acupuncture groups were insertion point pain, bruising, hematoma, bleeding, worsening of LBP, and pain other than LBP (pain in leg and shoulder). Authors concluded Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 12 of 32 that acupuncture may not play a more clinically meaningful role than sham in relieving pain immediately after treatment or in improving quality of life in the short term, and acupunctur e possibly did not improve back function compared to sham in the immediate term. However, acupuncture was more effective than no treatment in improving pain and function in the immediate term. Trials with usual care as the control showed acupuncture may not reduce pain clinically, but the therapy may improve function immediately after sessions as well as physical but not mental quality of life in the short term. The evidence was downgraded to moderate to very low - certainty considering most of studies had hi gh risk of bias, inconsistency, and small sample size introducing imprecision. The decision to use acupuncture to treat chronic low back pain might depend on the availability, cost and patient's preferences. Su et al. (2021) critically evaluated the evidence for acupuncture as an effective treatment for acute LBP (ALBP). Of the 13 eligible RCTs identified, 11 RCTs (involving 707 patients) provided moderate- quality evidence that acupuncture has a statistically significant association with improvements in VAS (visual analog scale) score. Two studies indicated that acupuncture did not influence the RMDQ (Roland -Morris Disability Questionnaire) scores more than the control treatment. Three studies suggested that acupuncture influenced the ODI (Oswestry Disabilit y Index) scores more than the control treatment. Two studies suggested that acupuncture influenced the number of medication taken more than the control treatment. Authors conclude that acupuncture treatment of acute LBP was associated with modest improvements in the VAS score, ODI score, and the number of pills, but not the RMDQ score. However findings should be considered with caution due to the low power original studies. High- quality trials are needed to assess further the role of acupuncture in the treatment of acute LBP. Wu et al. (2021) evaluated and compared the efficacy and safety of different acupuncture therapies for ALBP. In total, nineteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comprising 1,427 participants were included. Results showed the followin g: (I) compared with placebo, motion style acupuncture (MSA), manual acupuncture (MA), and electroacupuncture (EA) were found to be more effective for decreasing VAS score; (II) compared with pharmacotherapy, MSA and MA were found to be more effective in r educing ROM score. Results of the surface under the cumulative ranking curve indicated that all acupuncture types were superior to placebo or pharmacotherapy in lowering VAS and ROM score. It was noted that MSA was the most effective treatment. Authors concluded that this study indicated that acupuncture therapy achieved good therapeutic effects in the treatment of ALBP, especially MSA therapy. Nevertheless, due to the low quality of the included trials, the credibility of conclusions is low. Further well -designed RCTs with high quality and large samples are still needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture therapy for ALBP. Huang et al. (2021) investigated the effect and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of chronic spinal pain. Data was extracted from 22 RCTs including 2588 patients. Pooled analysis revealed that acupuncture can reduce chronic spinal pain compared to sham acupuncture), mediation control, usual care control, and no treatment control. In terms of functional disability, acupuncture can improve physical function at immediate- term follow -up, short -term follow -up, and long- term follow -up. In summary, compared to no treatment, sham acupuncture, or conventional therapy such as medication, massage, and physical exercise, acupunctur e has a significantly superior effect on the reduction in chronic spinal pain and function improvement. Acupuncture might be an effective treatment for patients with chronic spinal pain and it is a safe therapy. Baroncini et al. (2022) investigated the available randomized control trials (RCTs) to point out which acupuncture protocol is the most effective for chronic aspecific low back pain (LBP). Efficacy was measured in terms of pain (Visual Analogic Scale, VAS) and disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, RMQ), Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS). Data from 44 RCTs (8338 procedures) were retrieved. 56% of patients were women. The mean age of the patients was 48 \u00b1 10.6 years. The mean BMI was 26.3 \u00b1 2.2 kg/m2. Authors concluded that verum acupuncture is more effective than sham treatment for the non - pharmacological management of LBP. Among the verum protocols, individualized acupuncture and standard acupuncture with TENS were the protocols that resulted in the highest improvement i n pain and quality of life. Yang et al. (2022) investigated the effects of acupuncture on pain, functional status and quality of life for women with (low back and/or pelvic pain) LBPP pain during the pregnancy. The primary outcomes were pain, functional status and quality of life. The secondary outcomes were overall effects (a questionnaire at a post -treatment visit Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 13 of 32 within a week after the last treatment to determine the number of people who received good or excellent help), analgesic consumption, Apgar sco res >7 at 5 min, adverse events, gestational age at birth, induction of labour and mode of birth. This meta- analysis included 10 studies, reporting on a total of 1040 women. Overall, acupuncture significantly relieved pain during pregnancy and improved fun ctional status and quality of life. There was a significant difference for overall effects. However, there was no significant difference for analgesic consumption during the study period and Apgar scores of newborns. Preterm birth from acupuncture during the study period was reported in two studies. Although preterm contractions were reported in two studies, all infants were in good health at birth. Authors concluded that acupuncture significantly improved pain, functional status and quality of life in women with LBPP during the pregnancy. Additionally, acupuncture had no observable severe adverse influences on the newborns. More large- scale and well -designed RCTs are still needed to further confirm these results. Cancer Pain: A Cochrane Review by Paley et al. reviewed the trials of acupuncture for cancer pain in adults (Paley et al., 2011). Three RCTs with 204 patients met the inclusion criteria. One study compared traditional auricular acupuncture with auricular acupuncture at non- acupuncture points and wit h a control using non- invasive \"ear seeds,\" at non- acupuncture points. The remaining two studies compared acupuncture with pain medication. The reviewers concluded that while there was some evidence of acupuncture effectiveness there was a high risk of bias in all studies and no conclusions could be reached regarding acupuncture effectiveness. Paley et al. (2015) updated the Cochrane review. They found five studies (with a total of 285 participants) that compared acupuncture against either sham acupuncture or pain- killing medicines. All five identified studies had small sample sizes, which reduces the quality of their evidence. Authors reported that none of the studies described in this review were big enough to produce reliable results. None of the studies reported any harm to the participants. They concluded that there was insufficient evidence to judge whether acupuncture is eIective in relieving cancer pain in adults and that larger, well -designed studies are needed to provide evidence in this area. Yang et al. (2021) analyzed currently available publications regarding the use of acupuncture for pain management among patients with cancer in palliative care settings. Five studies (n=189) were included in this systematic review. Results indicated a favourabl e effect of acupuncture on pain relief in palliative care for patients with cancer. Authors concluded that acupuncture may be an effective and safe treatment associated with pain reduction in the palliative care of patients with cancer. Further high- qualit y, adequately powered studies are needed in the future. Li et al. (2021) evaluated the effect of acupuncture on treatment -related symptoms among breast cancer survivors. The primary outcomes were pain, hot flashes, sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, lymphedema, and neuropathy as individual symptoms. They also evaluated adverse events reported in acupuncture studies. Of 26 selected trials (2055 patients), 20 (1709 patients) were included in the meta- analysis. Acupuncture was more effective than control groups in improving pain intensity, fatigue, and hot flash severity. The subgroup analysis indicated that acupuncture showed trends but not significant effects on all the treatment -related symptoms compared with the sham acupuncture groups. Compared with waitlist control and usual care groups, the acupuncture groups showed significant reductions in pain intensity, fatigue, depression, hot flash severity, and neuropathy. No serious adverse events were reported related to acupuncture intervention . Mild adverse events (i.e., bruising, pain, swelling, skin infection, hematoma, headache, menstrual bleeding) were reported in 11 studies. This systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that acupuncture significantly reduces multiple treatment -related s ymptoms compared with the usual care or waitlist control group among breast cancer survivors. The safety of acupuncture was inadequately reported in the included studies. Based on the available data, acupuncture seems to be generally a safe treatment with some mild adverse events. These findings provide evidence- based recommendations for incorporating acupuncture into clinical breast cancer symptom management. Due to the high risk of bias and blinding issues in some RCTs, more rigorous trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of acupuncture in reducing multiple treatment -related symptoms among breast cancer survivors. Zhang et al. (2021) evaluated the effects of acupuncture in women with breast cancer (BC), focusing on patient - reported outcomes (PROs). Out of the 2, 524 identified studies, 29 studies representing 33 articles were included in this meta- analysis. At the end of treatment (EOT), the acupuncture patients' quality of life (QoL) was Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 14 of 32 measured by the QLQ -C30 QoL subscale, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Endocrine Symptoms (FACT -ES), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -General/Breast (FACT -G/B), and the Menopause- Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL), which depicted a significant improvement. The use of acupuncture in BC patients lead to a considerable reduction in the scores of all subscales of the Brief Pain Inventory -Short Form (BPI -SF) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) measuring pain. Moreover, patients treated with acupuncture were more likely to experience improvements in hot flashes scores, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and anxiety compared to those in the control group, while the improvements in depression were comparable across both groups. Long -term follow -up results were similar to the EOT results. Authors concluded that current evidence suggests that acupuncture might improve BC treatment -related symptoms measured with PROs including QoL, pain, fatigue, hot flashes, sleep disturbance and anxiety. However, a number of included studies report limited amounts of certain subgroup settings, thus more rigorous, well -designed and larger RCTs are needed to confirm our results. Ge et al. (2022) developed an evidence -based clinical practice guideline of acupuncture in the treatment of patients with moderate and severe cancer pain. Recommendations were developed through a Delphi consensus of an international multidisciplinary panel including 13 western medicine oncologists, Chinese medicine/acupuncture clinical practitioners, and two patient representatives. The certainty of evidenc e, patient preferences and values, resources, and other factors were fully considered in formulating the recommendations. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was employed to rate the certainty of evidence and the strength of recommendations. The guideline proposed three recommendations: (1) a strong recommendation for the treatment of acupuncture rather than no treatment to relieve pain in patients with moderate to severe cancer pain; (2) a weak recommendation for the combination treatments with acupuncture/acupressure to reduce pain intensity, decrease the opioid dose, and alleviate opioid -related side effects in moderate to severe cancer pain patients who are using analgesics; and (3) a strong recommendat ion for acupuncture in breast cancer patients to relieve their aromatase inhibitor -induced arthralgia. This proposed guideline provides recommendations for the management of patients with cancer pain. The small sample sizes of evidence limit the strength of the recommendations and highlights the need for additional research. Zhang et al. (2022) evaluated and summarized the systematic reviews (SRs) that assess the effects and safety of acupuncture for cancer -related conditions, and to inform clinical practic e and future studies. Fifty -one SRs of RCTs on acupuncture for cancer -related conditions were included and synthesized. The methodological quality of SRs included 1 \"high\", 5 \"low\" and 45 \"very low\" by AMSTAR 2. Acupuncture showed effectiveness on systemic conditions in relation to different cancers, including cancer -related pain (17 SRs, 80 RCTs), fatigue (7 SRs, 18 RCTs), insomnia (4 SRs, 10 RCTs), quality of life (2 SRs, 15 RCTs); conditions in relation to chemo - radiotherapy, including nausea and vomiting (3 SRs, 36 RCTs) and bone marrow suppression (2 SRs, 21 RCTs); and conditions in relation to specific cancers, including breast cancer -related menopause (3 SRs, 6 RCTs), hot flashes (12 SRs, 13 RCTs), arthralgia (5 SRs, 10 RCTs), and nasopharyngeal cance r-related dysphagia (1 SRs, 7 RCTs). Acupuncture appeared to have benefit for patients with lymphoedema (3 SRs, 3 RCTs), gastrointestinal function (5 SRs, 27 RCTs), and xerostomia (4 SRs, 7 RCTs). Limited evidence showed inconsistent results on acupuncture for chemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy (3 SRs, 6 RCTs), depression and anxiety (3 SRs, 9 RCTs). Acupuncture was regarded as a safe therapy for cancer patients as no severe adverse events related were reported. Authors concluded that evidence from SRs showed that acupuncture is beneficial to cancer survivors with cancer -related pain, fatigue, insomnia, improved quality of life, nausea and vomiting, bone marrow suppression, menopausal symptoms, arthralgia, and dysphagia, and may also be potential for lymphoedema, gastrointestinal function, and xerostomia. For neuropathy, depression and anxiety, acupuncture should be used as an option based on individual conditions. Acupuncture is relatively safe without serious adverse events. More well -designed clini cal trials of acupuncture are recommended on cancer - related depression and anxiety, arthralgia, xerostomia, gastrointestinal dysfunction and dysphagia. Abe et al. (2022) aimed to identify the current treatment options for pain and numbness in cancer surviv ors and to evaluate their effects. Cancer survivors were defined as patients diagnosed with cancer who had completed active cancer treatment, whose conditions were stable, and who had no evidence of recurrent or progressive disease. A meta- analysis was con ducted using the random -effects model to obtain the effect sizes of 7 types of treatments: opioid therapy, nonopioid pharmacotherapy, interventional therapy, acupuncture, Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 15 of 32 education/cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), physical exercise, and alternative medi cine. A total of 36 studies involving 2,870 cancer survivors were included. Among them, 35 (n=2,813) were included in the meta- analysis for pain. The analysis suggested that physical exercise, acupuncture, and alternative medicine could significantly reduc e pain. Nonopioid pharmacotherapy and education/CBT did not demonstrate significant effects. No studies were identified that investigated the effects of opioid therapy or interventional therapy on pain. Regarding numbness, 5 studies (n=566) were included i n the meta- analysis. Acupuncture (n=99; 2 studies) did not demonstrate significant effects on numbness, and the effects of nonopioid pharmacotherapy, education/CBT, and physical exercise could not be determined due to the small number of included studies. No studies were identified that investigated the effects of opioid therapy, interventional therapy, or alternative medicine on numbness. Authors concluded that this meta- analysis suggested that physical exercise, acupuncture, and alternative medicine may r educe pain in cancer survivors, with a very small to moderate amount of evidence. Mao et al. (2022) authored a joint guideline to provide evidence- based recommendations to practicing physicians and other health care providers on integrative approaches to managing pain in patients with cancer. The Society for Integrative Oncology and ASCO convened an expert panel oncology, oncology, surgical oncology, palliative oncology, social sciences, mind -body medicine, nursing, and patient advocacy representatives. The literature search included systematic reviews, meta- analyses, and randomized controlled trials published from 1990 through 2021. Outcomes of interest included pain intensity, symptom relief, and adverse events. Expert panel members used this evidence and informal consensus to develop evidence- based guideline recommendations. The literature search identified 227 relevant studies to inform the evidence base for this guideline. Recommendations included the following: Among adult patients, acupuncture should be recommended for aromatase inhibitor -related joint pain. Acupuncture or reflexology or acupressure may be recommended for general cancer pain or musculoskeletal pain. These recommendations are based on an int ermediate level of evidence, benefit outweighing risk, and with moderate strength of recommendation. There is insufficient or inconclusive evidence to make recommendations for pediatric patients. Hershman et al. (2022) examined the effect of acupuncture i n reducing AI -related joint pain through 52 weeks. A randomized clinical trial was conducted at 11 sites in the US from May 1, 2012, to February 29, 2016, with a scheduled final date of follow -up of September 5, 2017, to compare true acupuncture (TA) with sham acupuncture (SA) or waiting list control (WC). Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to the TA (n = 110), SA (n = 59), or WC (n = 57) group. The TA and SA protocols were composed of 6 weeks of intervention at 2 sessions per week (12 sessions overall), followed by 6 additional weeks of intervention with 1 session per week. Participants randomized to WC received no intervention. All participants were offered 10 acupuncture sessions to be used between weeks 24 and 52. Among 226 randomized, 191 (84.5%) completed the trial. In this randomized clinical trial, women with AI -related joint pain receiving 12 weeks of TA had reduced pain at 52 weeks compared with controls, suggesting long- term benefits of this therapy. Neuropathic Pain: Ju et al. (2017) assessed the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of acupuncture treatments for chronic neuropathic pain in adults. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with treatment duration of eight weeks or longer comparing acupuncture (either given alone or in combination with other therapies) with sham acupuncture, other active therapies, or treatment as usual, for neuropathic pain in adults were included in this review. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and pain relief. The secondary outcomes were any pain- related outcom e indicating some improvement, withdrawals, participants experiencing any adverse event, serious adverse events and quality of life. Authors included six studies involving 462 participants with chronic peripheral neuropathic pain (442 completers (251 male) , mean ages 52 to 63 years). Most studies included a small sample size (fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm) and all studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel. Authors concluded that due to the limited data avail able, there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of acupuncture for neuropathic pain in general, or for any specific neuropathic pain condition when compared with sham acupuncture or other active therapies. Yu et al. (2021) evaluated the clinical efficacy of acupuncture through a review and analysis of systematic reviews of Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 16 of 32 acupuncture for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Eighty eight reviews were retrieved. The inclusion criteria were a published systematic evaluation/meta- analysis/systematic review of acupuncture treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which included subjects meeting the diagnostic criteria for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and which compared acupuncture treatment with non- acupuncture treatment. Af ter the inclusion criteria had been applied, 18 reviews were finally included. Authors report that evidence shows that acupuncture improves diabetic peripheral neuropathy and increases nerve conduction velocity. However, the methodological quality of the r eviews is generally extremely low, and most of the reviews had certain defects, showing that there is still much room for improvement in terms of the methodology and quality of the research reports. Ben-Arye et al. (2022) explored the impact of acupuncture with other complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) modalities on chemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and quality of life (QoL) in oncology patients. In this prospective, pragmatic, and patient -preference study, patients with CIPN were t reated with acupuncture and CIM therapies (intervention group) or standard care alone (controls) for 6 weeks. Patients in the intervention arm were randomized to twice -weekly acupuncture- only (group A) or acupuncture with additional manual -movement or mind -body CIM therapies (group B). Severity of CIPN was assessed with various outcome measures. Of 168 participants, 136 underwent the study intervention (group A, 69; group B, 67), with 32 controls. Baseline- to-6-week assessment scores improved significantly in the intervention arm (vs controls) on FACT -Tax and emotional well -being scores; FACT -TAX scores for hand numbness/tingling and discomfort; and EORTC physical functioning. Intervention groups A and B showed improved FACT -Tax physical well-being, FACT -TAX total score, FACT -TAX feet discomfort, and EORTC pain scores. Authors concluded that acupuncture, with or without CIM modalities, can relieve CIPN -related symptoms during oncology treatment. This is most pronounced for hand numbness, tingling, pain, disco mfort, and for physical functioning. Musculoskeletal and Pain Disorders of the Extremities: Cox et al. (2016) assessed the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture therapies for musculoskeletal disorders of the extremities. The search revealed 5180 articles; 15 were included (10 with a low risk of bias, 5 with a high risk of bias). Authors concluded that the evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture for musculoskeletal disorders of the extremities was inconsistent. Traditional needle acupuncture may be beneficial for CTS and Achilles tendinopathy, but not for nonspecific upper extremity pain and patellofemoral syndrome. Electroacupuncture may be effective for shoulder injuries and may show similar effectiveness to that of night wrist splinting for CTS. The effectiveness of dry needling for plantar fasciitis is equivocal. Leggit (2018) summarized the consensus on acupuncture as a musculoskeletal therapy. Evidence regarding efficacy in the management of musculoskeletal conditions is heterogeneous and subject to several limitations. Despite these limitations, acupuncture consistently has been shown to be more effective than no treatment and is relatively safe. For chronic back pain, it is recommended as a first -line noninvasive therapy. For neck pain, acupuncture provides benefits when it is combined with other treatments. Babatunde et al. (2021) evaluated the comparative effectiveness of treatment options for relieving pain and improving function in patients with subacromial shoulder conditions (SSCs). The review identified 177 eligible trials. Current evidence shows small to moderate effect sizes for most treatment options for SSCs. Six treatments had a high probability of being most effective, in the short term, for pain and function [acupuncture, manual therapy, exercise, exercise plus manual therapy, laser therapy and Microcurrent (MENS) (TENS)], but with low certainty for most treatment options. After accounting for risk of bias, there is evidence of moderate certainty for the comparative effects of exercise on function in patients with SSCs. Future large, high- quality pragmatic randomized trials or meta -analyses are needed to better understand whether specific subgroups of patients respond better to some treatments than others. Fredy et al. (2022) described the role of acupuncture for myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) in interventional pain management. They summarized that acupuncture, combined with other therapies, is effective in reducing pain and improving physical function. Acupuncture can enhance endogenous opioids such as endorphins to relieve pain and enhance the healing process. Authors concluded that acupuncture could be considered as one of nonpharmacological options in Interventional Pain Management for MPS. Interventions with acupuncture are safe and have minimal side effects when performed by a trained and competent practitioner. Acupuncture (CPG 024) Page 17 of 32 Nausea and Vomiting : A 2009 Cochrane Review (Lee and Fan, 2009) evaluated studies of the stimulation of wrist acupuncture point P6 for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Forty trials were identified with 4858 individual subjects. Overall, acupuncture was found to be equally effective as anti -emetic drugs. This was true for both adults and children. It was also found equally effective whether using invasive needles or non- invasive stimulation of the acupuncture point. Zhang et al. performed a meta-analysis (Zhang et al., 2015) on the use of wristband at acupuncture points for postoperative nausea and vomiting. They found a significant reduction in post -operative vomiting through the use of the wrist band compared to controls. However, they found no difference in the rates of nausea between wrist band and control. Lu et al. (2021) explored acupuncture's clinical efficacy in treating hyperemesis gravidarum HG. A total of 16 trials covering 1043 gravidas were included. Compared with the conventional treatment, acupuncture had a significantly higher effective rate, a higher conversion rate of urine ketone, an improvement rate of nausea and vomiting, and a relatively higher improvement rate of food intake. Acupuncture also shortened hospitalization time and manifested with a lower pregnancy termination rate and fewer adverse events. Nevertheless, no statistical variation in the improvement of nausea intensity, vomiting episodes, and lassitude symptom, recurrence rate, and serum potassium was observed. Authors concluded suggested that acupuncture was effective in treating HG. However, as the potential inferior quality and underlying publication bias were found in the included studies, there is a need for more superior -quality RCTs to examine their effectiveness and safety. Mora et al. (2022) performed a systematic review and meta-analysis about the use and effect of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities to treat adverse effects of conventional cancer treatment among children and young adults. Twenty RCTs comprising 1,069 participants were included in this review. The included studies investigated acupuncture, mind-body therapies, supplements, and vitamins for chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), oral mucositis, and anxiety among children and young adults who underwent conventional cancer treatment. Seven studies (315 participants) were included in the meta- analys is. The overall effect of CAM (including acupuncture and hypnosis only) on chemotherapy -induced nausea and/or vomiting and controls was statistically significant. There was a significant difference between acupuncture and controls (n = 5) for intensity and/or episodes of CINV. Authors concluded that current evidence from this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials shows that CAM, including acupuncture and hypnosis only, is effective in reducing chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting in children and young adults. More rigorous trials and long- term effects should be investigated if acupuncture and hypnosis are to be recommended for clinical use. Acup uncture Point Injection Therapy: There is insufficient evidence in the peer -reviewed published scienti fic literature to support safety and efficacy of acupuncture point injection therapy (Wang et al., 2015; Cho et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2019; Xie et al, 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Data comparing the effectiveness of different products, methods of stimulati on and overall clinical utility is lacking. Providers of Acupuncture Services: Acupuncture services are delivered by a qualified provider of acupuncture acting within the scope of their license as regulated by the Federal and State governments. Generally, only those healthcare practitioners who hold an active license, certification, or registration with the applicable state board or agency may provide services. Benefits for services provided by these healthcare providers may also be dependent upon the member's benefit contract language. Note: 1) This list of codes may not be all -inclusive. 2) Deleted codes and codes which are not effective at the time the service is rendered may not be eligible for reimburs ement.
