As part of this commitment, Ursinus will make good faith efforts to provide reasonable religious accommodations to those in our community whose genuinely held religious beliefs would conflict with an academic or employment requirement unless such an accommodation would fundamentally alter the educational, workplace, or mission of the college. The college hopes to honor the cultural, dietary, and housing-related needs of those requesting religious accommodations as part of a sincerely held belief. Please contact the office of religious and spiritual life to discuss such needs. Definitions Religion or Creed - Includes traditional, organized religions as well as sincerely held religious and faith beliefs, including those that are not part of a formal church or sect. All aspects of religious belief and observance that are sincerely held will be considered as part of this policy. Religious or Spiritual Observance - Any change in the work or academic environment that enables a student or employee to observe a religious/spiritual practice or belief will be considered. A reasonable accommodation for religious and spiritual observances may include but is not limited to: The ability to observe a religious holiday or attend religious events. Time for prayer during the school or workday. The wearing of religious attire. The observing of dietary restrictions in accordance with one's faith. Support for residential practices consistent with one's faith. Requests for accommodations will be considered on a case-by-case basis taking into account factors including but not limited to, the fundamental requirements of the applicable academic program, essential functions of an individual's job, the duties of others in the department, the requirements of the department or major, any impact of the request, the duration of the request, and the availability of alternative options. Procedures for Seeking Accommodations for Religious and Spiritual Observance The College will make reasonable efforts to support requests for accommodations under this policy. The individual making the request should provide advance notice in accordance with the expectation of the department, division, or office. Students Students who expect to miss classes, examinations, or other assignments due to religious observance shall be provided with a reasonable alternative opportunity to complete their academic obligations. It is the responsibility of students to provide faculty with reasonable notice of the dates of religious observances on which they will be absent by submitting a written request two weeks before the observance to the instructor. The faculty member and the student should discuss reasonable alternatives. A student making a request specifically for final exams must complete and submit the following form: [https://www.ursinus.edu/live/files/3342-religious-accommodation-during-exams](/live/files/3342-religious-accommodation-during-exams) Absence from classes or examinations for religious reasons does not excuse students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence. The instructor may take appropriate measures if the student fails to complete any alternative assignment or examination. Employees All employees may submit a written request for accommodations in support of religious and spiritual observance to their department head or supervisor. Employees may also submit a request to the Office of Human Resources. Employees who anticipate being absent from work because of a religious or spiritual observance must submit a request for time off in advance and as soon as they become aware of the need or at least (14) business days in advance.
