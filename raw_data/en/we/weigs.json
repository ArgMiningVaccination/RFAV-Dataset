These types of treatments include use of dietary supplements, megadose vitamins, herbal preparations, special teas, acupuncture, massage therapy, movement therapy and music therapy (National Cancer Institute, 2020). One internet resource that I found that does a great job of addressing preventative health care is the EuroMed Foundation (euromedfoundation.com). This specific website talks about complementary and alternative therapies in holistic cancer treatment and they pride themselves in offering preventative benefits via treatments that can be incorporated into everyday life. This site also has it's own YouTube channel with videos talking more about treatments and even videos that show how treatments work. These types of benefits work great for patients who have busy schedules and who are motivated to make changes on their own time. "}
