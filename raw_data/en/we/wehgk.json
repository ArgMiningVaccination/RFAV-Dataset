The healing practice, which involves the insertion of thin needles into the skin, is primarily used to relieve pain but is also used to help prevent and treat other conditions. \"When we insert needles into specific points on the body called acupoints, we send a message to the body to 'rebalance' the flow of energy,\" says Michelle Zhang, a TCM practitioner from Balanced Health in Hong Kong. These points serve as a communication pathway. \"The energy, commonly known as qi, should flow freely and unobstructed. If there are blockages in this flow, illness may arise. By re-establishing good energy flow, the body can start to heal itself and your health will be restored.\" Acupuncture - then and now Acupuncture was mentioned in an ancient Chinese medical text known as the Huangdi Neijing (the Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor), which dates back to about 100BC.

The concept of channels through which qi flows was already well-established at this time, Zhang says. The location of acupuncture points throughout the body developed later.

[The demand for acupuncture](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/2100908/acupuncture-proves-effective-weight-loss-tool-hong?module=inline&pgtype=article)continues to grow around the world as more people understand how the therapy, and TCM in general, can improve their health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also recognised its value. With its use acknowledged in 113 WHO member states, acupuncture is the most common form of traditional medicine practice, according to the WHO's \"Global Report on Traditional and Complementary Medicine 2019\".

How acupuncture is performed A TCM practitioner will first ask a patient about their medical history, health issues and lifestyle habits. They will also check the tongue and the pulse on both wrists. These are essential components in Chinese medicine diagnosis, Zhang says. Dr Cecilia Th\u00e9, a TCM practitioner at Vitality Centre in Hong Kong, says they use sterile, disposable, stainless-steel needles, although some people prefer to use their own set of silver or gold needles; these personal needles are sterilised after each use. \"The needles come in various lengths and thicknesses, and we'll use different needles based on the patient's sensitivity to pain and the area being treated,\" she says. \"Sometimes, the needle may be inserted a little deeper past the surface of the skin - deep enough to have an effect - but it never touches a nerve.\" Typically, the needles are left in place for 30 minutes, or 10 to 20 minutes in children. The needles are placed along meridians, or energy centres. This stimulates the body's own healing power, sending energy to where it's needed and helping free up any blockages that are hindering the flow of qi. During this time, the patient's body temperature may decrease, their heartbeat and respiration may slow down, and any muscle tension may dissipate. In most cases, says Zhang, the patient will enter a very relaxed state. Some practitioners perform electroacupuncture in which the needles are attached to a device that generates a microcurrent. The technique uses two needles at a time, allowing the current to pass between them. Studies have shown electroacupuncture to be especially effective at treating pain. Another form of acupuncture, known as auricular acupuncture or ear acupuncture, involves placing acupuncture needles or nodules into specific points around the ear. Stimulating these points is believed to help with a number of conditions, from obesity to anxiety relief.

In this case, acupuncture can help rebalance your system. \"It's best to consult a TCM practitioner to find out if you're suited to have the treatment or not.\" Acupuncture is widely used in American hospitals to help with pain relief and to minimise discomfort for cancer patients. In the past decade, the United States military began teaching auricular acupuncture to non-TCM practitioners to treat war veteran patients who require inexpensive relief from anxiety and pain. Risks and side effects If a needle accidentally pricks a blood vessel, you may experience slight bleeding after the needle is removed, but just a drop or so, says Th\u00e9. You may notice bruises on your skin after a session as well, but these disappear on their own after a few days. People who suffer from a bleeding disorder, who are taking blood-thinning medication, who have a pacemaker or who are pregnant, are not good candidates for acupuncture.

Zhang says that if you experience flu-like symptoms such as a slight headache or achy muscles, it doesn't mean that anything is wrong. \"Acupuncture facilitates a cleansing and balancing process, and these symptoms will pass as the body starts to heal,\" she says. \"Treat yourself well after an acupuncture session - relax, take a warm bath, hydrate, and get sufficient quality sleep.
