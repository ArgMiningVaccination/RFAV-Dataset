Ms. Jorgensen discussed a capstone project from Pacific University, offering instructions for expanded function dental assistants to be able to train, test for and be certified in providing local anesthesia, similar to the training for a dental hygienist. Dr. Salathe provided an official response from the ODA concluding that expanding the scope of dental assistant s to include local anesthesia via nerve blocks was inappropriate due to lack of reporting on individual dental assistants, rather incidents would be reported under the supervising dentist or dental hygienist. The ODA does not feel that the available training would be adequate to provide competency. Further , the ODA cited that no other state allows an unregulated group to administer local anesthesia via nerve blocks. Ms. Jorgensen responded, pointing out that dental assistants do have rules and training similar to dental hygienists in the area of restorative functions. Further, this project was in response to a survey of dentists asking for dental assistants to be able to provide local anesthesia under indirect supervision. Ms. Jorgensen thinks this new certification would help to alleviate the July 12, 2023 Licensing, Standards and Competency Meeting Page 4 of 10 workforce shortage of dental assistants. Dr. Clark pointed out that he was bothered by the ODA stance because the ODA recently supported the loosening of dental assistant testing and credentials in a recent legislative bill. Dr. Clark supports additional credentialing for dental assistants and notes that dental assistants are regulated and adverse reports can be tracked through the supervising dentist. Dr. Clark stated that a rigorous curriculum can be created to provide a standard of care to benefit the public, the dental assistants and the entire dental team. Ms. Martinez recommended this project be moved forward for other committees to discuss. Ms. Kramer moved and Dr. Kansal seconded the Committee recommend that the Board move OAR 818-042- 00XX as presented to the Rules Oversight Committee. The motion passed with Dr. Kansal, Dr. Clark, Ms. Jorgensen, Ms. Kramer, Ms. Ludwig, and Ms. Martinez voting aye. Dr. Salathe voted no. OAR 818-042-00XX Local Anesthesia Functions of Dental Assistants (1) The Board shall issue a Local Anesthesia Functions Certificate (LAFC) to a dental assistant who holds an Oregon EFDA Certificate, and has successfully completed a Board approved curriculum from a program accredited by the Commission on Denta l Accreditation of the American Dental Association or other course of instruction approved by the Board. (2) A dental assistant may administer local anesthetic agents and local anesthetic reversal agents under the indirect supervision of a licensed dentist. Local anesthetic reversal agents shall not be used on children less than 6 years of age or weighing less than 33 pounds. The committee was directed to review the documents regarding a dental/dental hygiene licensing compact. Director Prisby referenced the documents and said it was important to have the committee looped in on this and it will probably be an issue for Oregon to address in t he future. The Board of Dentistry would have similar issues and concerns with implementing it, that the Oregon Occupational Therapy Licensing referenced in the documents. Lori Lindley added there were a number of legal issues as well. There was brief dis cussion with the ODA having no position on it at this time. Ms. Kramer went on record to say that the ODHA is in favor of a potential licensure compact. The Committee reviewed and briefly discussed the rules regarding radiologic proficiency certification for dental assistants. Ms. Jorgensen moved and Ms. Martinez seconded the Committee recommend that the Board keep OAR 818-042- 0050 as presented. The motion passed unanimously.

The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m. 8699 SW Sun Place Wilsonville, Oregon 97070 -3710 503.218.2010 / 800.452.5628 fax 503.218.2009 www.oregondental.org Oregon Board of Dentistry 1500 SW 1st Avenue, Suite 770 Portland, OR 97201 August 13th, 2023 Dear members of the Board of Dentistry: ODA is a membership association of over 2,000 dentists across the state. Our decisions to weigh in on policy proposals are made by members of various committees within our governance structure. On most regulatory issues, issues are discussed at our Regulat ory Affairs Council and may be elevated to our Board of Trustees. Both groups are broad in representation and diverse in perspective. Both groups have reviewed the initial proposal for dental assistants to perform local anesthesia, and both groups strongly oppose the proposal. We strongly urge the Board not to move this issue forward further. ODA has deep concerns with the proposal for the following primary reasons: 1) Dental assistants are not a regulated group (i.e. no licensure requirement) by the state of Oregon and as such, there is no reporting mechanism for tracking adverse outcomes for assistants. Regulation exists in order to ensure public safety and to maintain a certain standard. It allows not only for disciplinary action and remediation for those injured but also for identifying practitioners who need additional education. ODA members voiced significant concern related to the ability of the Board of Dentistry, dentists in private practice or corporate settings who would be hiring dental assistants, or the general public, to track and/or access records of a dental assistant who may have experienced a significant adverse patient outcome such as death from overdose, seizure, inability to manage a medical emergency such as anaphylaxis or nerve injury under indirect supervision. Currently, if an adverse event occurs, due to a dental assistants' error, the dentist will be disciplined by the Oregon Board of Dentistry. With this proposal, there will not be a public record associated with the dental assistant who administered the regional anesthesia causing death or injury. There would be no opportunity to enforce additional education for that dental assistant to prevent another adverse outcome. A future hiring dentist would not necessarily have knowledge of the concerns; a patient would not have the ability to review their regional anesthesia provider's safety record. For this primary reason, the ODA members concluded that expanding the scope of dental assistants to provide regional local anesthesia was inappropriate due to lack of reporting which could adversely affect patients throughout the state as a troubled assistant moved jobs without remediation. 2) Dental assistant curriculum is currently inadequate for the administration of regional nerve blocks using local anesthesia. ODA members discussed what education/course work could prepare an individual dental practitioner to be competent to safely deliver local anesthetic. As the necessary course work was described and discussed, it became clear that a si ngle course, or even a series of few courses, could not cover sufficient pharmacology, anatomy (including dissection of cadavers), and emergency management training to ensure provider 8699 SW Sun Place Wilsonville, Oregon 97070 fax 503.218.2009 www.oregondental.org competency. Ultimately , ODA members felt that the base knowledge necessary prior to course work specific to local regional anesthesia is so critical and broad that an individual should pursue a hygiene education to obtain this skill set. 3) Finally, no other state allows an unregulated group to administer local regional anesthesia via nerve blocks (e.g. epidural, Bier block or blocks of the trigeminal nerve). ODA believes that it is because of the issues outlined above that other states have declined this initiative. Finally, there has been much reference made to a survey conducted where dentists indicate they would like dental assistants to have this expanded function. We have not seen any data about how many dentists were included in this survey, the method of data collection for this surve y, or other metrics to determine if the results are representative of a larger opinion, or if the survey itself is scientifically sound. To the contrary, in our discussion with our volunteers, there is overwhelming opposition to the proposal. When pressed whether any changes could be made to the proposal to make it better, our leadership overwhelmingly reflects that the minimum education required for individuals to safely perform these procedures is most of a dental hygiene degree and that individuals performing this scope of practice should be licensed by the state. We agree that there is a need to examine rules around dental assistants ' credentialing, requirements, education standards and career pathways. We welcome those conversations. Sincerely, Mark Mi ller, DMD, MAGD, ODA President Stacy Geisler, DDS, Phd, ODA Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Olesya Salathe, DMD, ODA BOT member, Board of Dentistry Liaison Oregon Board of Dentistry 1500 SW 1st Avenue, Suite 770 Portland, OR 97201 Submitted electronically to: Stephen.PRISBY@obd.oregon.gov August 14, 2023 Dear Members of the Oregon Board of Den;stry: The Oregon Society of Anesthesiologists (OSA) is a membership organiza;on represen;ng physician anesthesiologists across the state. Our members are dedicated to pa;ent safety and access to care. We write to express concerns over the proposal to allow dental assistants to administer local anesthesia. We respecLully urge the Board not to advance this proposal. While dental assistants are cri;cal members of the overall care team, the OSA has grave pa;ent safety concerns with the proposal. Administra;on of local anesthe;c requires a knowledge of anatomy, pharmacology and physiology (especially medical contraindica;ons or how to respond to adverse events). I ncorrect administra;on can cause signicant\u2014and even permanent\u2014harm to pa;ents. Risks include anaphylaxis, nerve injury, stroke or even death. Current dental assistant programs do not include the necessary level of training required to safely administer local anesthe;c, and these skills cannot be taught in a condensed course, or even several courses. There is also concern over record keeping, since dental assistants are not licensed and prac;ce under the supervision of a den;st. If an adverse outcome were to occur at the hands of a dental assistant, there will be no public record associated with the assistant, which would make it dicult for the Board to enforce addi;onal educa;on to prevent another adverse outcome. The Oregon Society of Anesthesiologists strongly urges the board not to advance this proposal. Thank you for your considera;on. John Meyer, MD President Oregon Society of Anesthesiologists johnmeyer0814@gmail.com At the August 25, 2023 Board Meeting the Oregon Board of Dentistry (OBD) established a new standing Advisory Committee named the \"Dental Assistant Workforce Shortage Advisory Committee (DAWS AC)\" per ORS 679.280, to review , discuss and make recommendations to the Board on addressing workforce shortages in accordance with HB 3223 (2023).

Attachment #5Page 2 AGENCY MISSION The Mission of the Oregon Board of Dentistry is to promote quality oral health care and protect all communities in the State of Oregon by equitably and ethically regulating dental professionals. AGENCY FUNCTION The Oregon Board of Dentistry (OBD) is comprised of a ten member board and eight staff members. The Board Members are selected by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. The staff members are state employees who were hired through the state of Oregon's HR employment system. The OBD utilizes outside HR support for all recruitment efforts. The authority and responsibilities of the Oregon Board of Dentistry (OBD) are contained in Oregon Revised Statutes Chapter 679 (Dentists & Dental Therapists), Chapter 680.010 to 680.205 (Dental Hygienists), and Oregon Administrative Rules, Chapter 818. These statutes charge the OBD with the responsibility to regulate the practice of dentistry, dental therapy and dental hygiene by enforcing the standards of practice established in statute and rule. The primary program activities are Licensing, Enforcement and Monitoring, and Administration. Attachment #5Page 3 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement OBD is committed to establishing, monitoring, and maintaining a diverse workforce, reflective of the population in the State of Oregon, where all employees are valued, treated fairly, and given opportunities to develop, thrive and feel that they truly belong. This is a commitment to an active program that provides equal opportunities for all persons regardless of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, age, or disability. Every employee plays a part in our diverse workforce and inclusive work environment by being respectful and supportive, and by acting with integrity and respect to one another. Each person's skills, talents, knowledge, experiences, and personalities broaden the range of perspectives and approaches to conducting the work we do at the OBD. OBD can best promote excellence by recruit ing, retaining, and accommodating a diverse group of staff in an environment of respect that is supportive of their workplace success. This climate of diversity, inclusion and excellence is critical to successfully attaining our mission of contributing leadership and resources to increase the skills, knowledge and career opportunities of Oregonians. The OBD is an equal -opportunity employer that is committed to a proactive role in the recruitment and selection process. The OBD will use diverse recruitmen t strategies to identify and attract candidates and establish interview panels that represent protected- class groups. The OBD is committed to providing broad and culturally enriched training, career growth and developmental opportunities to all employees on an equal basis, enabling them to further advance and promote their knowledge, skills, and abilities and their value of diversity The Affirmative Action Policy and Diversity & Inclusion Statement will appear on the OBD's webpage. Additionally, OBD's plan will be provided to all new employees, posted in the employees' common area, and linked in OBD's quarterly newsletter. All OBD employees, with a higher emphasis of responsibility placed on management employees, are responsible for the implementation of the Affirmative Action Policy and Diversity & Inclusion in the workplace. Employees and Board members are expected to ensure that they are aware of the Affirmative Action Policy and Diversity & Inclusion statement and follow the policy and statement guidelines as it pertains to their work, especially during the hiring process. An individual who has interviewed for employment, who believes they were denied employment based on any of the aforementioned discriminatory factors, may file a complaint with the Executive Director on behalf of the Board. All reported incidents will be investigated promptly, thoroughly, impartially, and discreetly. The investigator will notify the complainant in writing of the results of the investigation. Formal appeals/complaints may also be filed with the state's Affirmative Action Office; the Bureau of Labor and Industries; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (909 First Avenue, Ste. 400, Seattle, WA 98104- 1061); or t he United States Department of Labor, Office of Civil Rights. Attachment #5Page 4 The purpose of this statement is to update and maintain the previously initiated affirmative action program for the OBD in keeping with the directive of the GO, State and Federal laws and regulations, and executive orders of the President of the United States of America concerning diversity and inclusion/affirmative action discrimination/non- discrimination guidelines appropriate under the Civil Rights Acts, equal employment opportunity (EEO) policies, and the Americans with Disabilities Act by which our good faith efforts must be directed. We support the work of the OCC and GO, both inside and outside of state government. The OBD's 2022 - 2025 Strategic plan aligns with our agency's goals based on the State of Oregon's 2023- 2025 Affirmative Action Plan and the State of Oregon's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Action Plan. While the OBD was created by state laws, we seek to ensure that the OBD builds an organization that uses the concepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), such as problem -solving, innovation, and organizational development, to create a workplace that is stronger, better functioning, and more dynamic, and that can deliver the best possible service to the people of Oregon (see Appendix B). 2023- 2025 Overview and Plan During the 2023- 2025 biennium, the OBD will work toward meeting its affirmative action, diversity, equity, inclusion, and altruistic goals. . The Board members turned over due to the term limits on Board members. It welcomed five new Board members during the 2021- 2023 Biennium. These five were chosen by Governor Kate Brown and confirmed by the Senate. There will at least 5 board member openings during the 2023- 2025 Biennium due to board members terming out at various times. All the basic tasks and mission of the Board to license, regulate and protect the public will remain the Board's highest priorities. The OBD's 2022 - 2025 Strategic Plan defines priorities in alignment with its statutory oblig ations and its mission - to promote quality oral health care and protect all communities in the State of Oregon by equitably and ethically regulating dental professionals. The OBD is challenged to address a rapid and accelerating rate of change. Significant shifts are occurring in oral healthcare, dentistry practice, dental therapy services, organizational structures, business models and markets. The Strategic Plan is referenced in this document for its direct alignment with this affirmative action plan for 2023 - 2025. The OBD sees its mission as elevating the standard of oral health care in Oregon, not solely though regulation but through information, outreach, and education. Additionally, new mandates from the Governor and the Legislature challenge all st ate agencies to address racial disparities and social determinants of health in the healthcare environment. Attachment #5Page 5 The OBD seeks to be an active partner with those that seek a better Oregon for everyone in ways that our small agency can make an impact. The OBD Board Members and staff ratios have historically remained consistent in terms of the protected classes. At the time of this report, the Board is comprised of 10 Board members, of whom are: one Caucasian man, one Hispanic man, one African American man, one Middle Eastern man, two Asian women, three Caucasian women, and one Native American woman. There are currently eight OBD staff comprised of one Caucasian man, one Hispanic man, one Multiple Ethnicities man, and five Caucasian women. In th e past biennium, there has been a noted shift in the classification of worker generation. In previous years, a significant portion of the staff was classified as Baby Boomers. As of June 1 2023, OBD staff include three Millennials, three Generation X, and two Baby Boomers, a much a wider range in the generations (See Organization Charts Appendix C). Employees are urged to cross- train whenever possible so that they may take advantage of those opportunities when they occur. The OBD's Executive Director promotes and encourages professional development training. OBD Staff have annually attended the DEI Conference and found great value in it. Attachment #5Page 6 2023- 2025 DEI Plan We have finite resources and bandwidth to address and work meaningfully on all 10 strategies identified in the state's most recent Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Action Plan. The OBD will focus on these 4 areas: Strategy/Focus Area - Communications Challenge: Staff and communities are unaware of programs and services available to them. Actions: Engage the Racial Justice Commission and Office of Cultural Change. Attend Meetings. Ensure all Executive Orders are being followed and implemented. Share employment opportunities with the Office of Cultural Change, Partners in Diversity, and other DEI minded organizations. Timeline: By July 1, 2024 Strategy/Focus Area - Community Engagement Challenge: Staff and communities are overburdened by engagement process. Time needs to be allocated to further engage in DEI actions to support community engagement with the OBD. Actions: Review current outreach processes. Connect with professional associations, dental school, dental hygiene schools and dental therapy programs. Educate staff and Board Members on DEI processes during staff and Board meetings. Increase ease of access to OBD services and information Ensure equity exists in investigation outcomes Timeline: By July 1, 2025 Attachment #5Page 7 Strategy/Focus Area - Diversifying Workforce Challenge: The OBD has limited resources and its mission is not directly focused on workforce, growth, shortages or other. It can do its part with information, education and be a resource. Actions: How to leverage and partner with organizations that have more resources and focus in the area of the oral healthcare work force. Dental Assisting education programs Dental Hygiene Programs Dental Therapy programs Tribes OHA OHAA ODHA ODA Timeline: By July 1, 2025 Strategy/Focus Area - Increase Awareness of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion within the Board Challenge: There are a lot of hats that Board and Staff members wear and a lot of documents to read and review. Need to plan extra time for integration and awareness. Actions : Share and encourage participation by OBD staff in all DEI events and educational opportunities, such as the Annual DEI Conference. Our strategy is to revise and update our current processes, while encouraging the awareness of the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion within our Board and staff, will be implemented over the next biennium with the hopes of creating a more inclusive working environment and culture that supports the Governor's efforts and the OBD as well. Timeline: By July 1, 2024 Strategy/Focus Area -Data Challenge: There is very little data on communities we serve and where consumers look for information Actions: Develop a data strategy that gathers where community members are looking for information about the OBD and the services we provide.

Fine, DMD Gary Underhill, DMD Reza J. Kansal, DDS Stephen Prisby Director Haley Robinson - Office Manager Winthrop \"Bernie\" Carter, DDS - Dental Director/Chief Investigator Angela M. Smorra, DMD - Dental Investigator Ingrid Nye - Investigator Lori Lindley - Sr. Assistant Attorney General Facilitators: Jennifer Coyne - CEO, The PEAK Fleet Theresa Trelstad - Contractor Consultant, The PEAK Fleet Attachment #6Oregon Board of Dentistry 2022 -2025 Strategic Plan 3 Oregon Board of Dentistry Strategic Plan Overview The Oregon Board of Dentistry's (OBD) responsibilities and oversight authority is bestowed from the Oregon Revised Statutes Chapter 679 (Dentists), Chapter 680.10 to 680.205 (Dental Hygienists), Oregon Administrative Rules Chapter 818. In addition, direction for Dental Therapists is guided by HB 2528 (2021) and the addition of Interim Therapeutic Restorations, HB 2627 (2021) for Expanded Practice Dental Hygienists. These new statutes task the OBD with regulation and oversight of the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene by enforcing standards of practice established in the Oregon Legislature statutes and rule. At the end of the previous 2017- 2020 planning cycle and after hardships of the COVID 19 pandemic (which has persisted from 2020 into 2022), OBD had established transformative ways of addressing critical issues. Strong relationships with the Governor's office, Oregon Legislature, Oregon Health Authority, peer professional organizations, and national associations gave context and direction, and kept a finger on the pulse of rapid changes in the dental profession, business practices, and operating models. In mid- 2021 the Board and staff of OBD agreed to secure professional, external strategy and facilitation services in the creation of their next multi -year strategic plan, building upon the efforts of the 2017- 2020 Plan. During the planning process, the OBD Board and Staff agreed to update the mission statement to reflect a focus on access to care as well as on integrity. The OBD will implement the strategic plan, adaptively to rapidly changing circumstances, in support of its Mission: to promote quality oral health care and protect all communities in the State of Oregon by equitably and ethically regulating dental professionals. Through external market research, initial discussions with the Board and Staff, and tabulation of the licensee surveys, a set of priorities emerged. Through the facilitated process between August and October 2021, five key strategic priorities were defined and goals established. Actions needed to meet the strategic goals were drafted and prioritized. Covered in more detail in the subsequent pages, focus for the next 3-5 years will be on Licensure Evolution (including Dental Therapy legislation implementation), Attachment #6Oregon Board of Dentistry 2022 -2025 Strategic Plan 4 Dental Practice Accountability, Workplace Environment, Technology & Processes, and Community Interaction & Equity. This multi -year strategic plan outlines OBD's path and efforts to engage constituents on many levels to upscale practices and processes reflecting the changing environment and statutory responsibilities. The new strategic plan is built upon a foundation of strength in Staff and Board expertise and experience, as well as positive Licensee sentiment, expressed as 78% positive, following a very tough year with the pandemic and other social impacts (especially on the healthcare industry). In addition, the Board and Staff defined and approved organizational core values of integrity , fairness , responsibility , and community. Combined with a focus on mission, the newly defined core values are a visible lens through which to make decisions and set direction. Oregon Board of Dentistry Mission Statement & Core Values Mission of the Oregon Board of Dentistry: To promote quality oral health care and protect all communities in the State of Oregon by equitably and ethically regulating dental professionals. Oregon Board of Dentistry Core Values: Integrity Fairness Responsibility Community Attachment #6Oregon Board of Dentistry 2022 -2025 Strategic Plan 5 Oregon Board of Dentistry Organizational & External Influences Analysis This organizational and external analysis covers the internal factors that will influence the ability to respond to operational needs as well as the external factors that may drive change. The Oregon Board of Dentistry analyzed the social, technological, economic, legal/regulatory, and environmental factors that might affect the practice of dentistry and the OBD's oversight. In addition, the current organizational status was analyzed primarily through staff interviews. The most significant Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats that affect the OBD are: STRENGTHS Foundation of known, common values: Integrity, Fairness, Responsibility, Community and commitment to the mission Skilled, experienced, and dedicated staff Successful migration and knowledge transfer as new Board and Staff onboarded during previous strategic period Foresight and proactive succession and onboarding planning Board composition provides a breadth of perspectives Member survey shows support in OBD remains high at 78% after problematic pandemic year WEAKNESSES Lack of clear understanding for OBD scope and jurisdiction by public, patients and Licensees Limited control over budget/funding impact ability to adjust staffing plans to meet overall strategic plan needs Legislature changes can create significant increases in staff work that are not in alignment with staffing capacity Low levels of Licensee participation in inputs/surveys. 2020 strategic priorities member survey had 265 responses Board member turnover creates loss of continuity and historical knowledge OPPORTUNITIES Ability to implement Dental Therapy licensure process Migration of technology to improve licensee experience, overall processes & efficiency, and provide workplace flexibility Collaboration with Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to manage public engagement and expectations for language, cultural diversity, equity, and inclusion across OHA partners. (With guidance from the State Racial Justice Council.) THREATS Continued lagging technology infrastructure Shifts in business operations and managed care pose challenges to dentistry practices and regulation Insurance maximums dating to the 1960's influence patient care recommendations Attachment #6Oregon Board of Dentistry 2022 -2025 Strategic Plan 6 In addition to the SWOT items called out above it is important to note that ability to address Opportunities, Threats, and Weaknesses will come from the areas of Strength. For instance, the Engaged Board and Staff expertise coupled with the learnings from the migration and knowledge transfer of the previous period is the key to implementing needed technology infrastructure which in turn drives the hybrid work environment. In a similar fashion, collaboration with OHA and the State Racial Justice Council recommendations will set standards for community engagement, helping clarify OBD scope and public expectations for interaction with the OBD. Attachment #6Oregon Board of Dentistry 2022 -2025 Strategic Plan 7 STRATEGIC PRIORITY A Licensure Evolution In support of providing quality oral care equitably to all, the dental profession must address the issue of communities having access to dental care services. This access may be limited by lack of dental care professionals in certain community areas such as rural areas, lower socio -economic areas, or tribal communities. Solving this problem requires creativity and the evolution of types of licenses granted. As new legislation is created, the OBD must implement rules and standards to govern dental professionals in Oregon. Develop and implement rules based on legislation changes Successfully implement Dental Therapy license Develop and implement rules in support of HB 2528 (2021) for newly created Dental Therapist license Develop and implement communication strategies with communities most impacted by Dental Therapy license implementation Engage interested parties to learn more and gather feedback about implementing Dental Therapy practice in Oregon Goals Action Items Attachment #6Oregon Board of Dentistry 2022 -2025 Strategic Plan 8 STRATEGIC PRIORITY B Dental Practice Accountability The landscape of dental practices continues to evolve further toward group dentistry practice including ownership by national corporate entities. This in turn, creates challenges and complexity in ensuring the public safety and high standards of practice are upheld. In addition, when complaints are made, establishing appropriate accountability and encouraging improvements to happen is more challenging than in the past. Ensure Licensees dictate clinical care provided to patients (in contrast to corporate non-Licensees driving care decisions) Increase OBD visibility into practice ownership models OBD jurisdiction over Dental practices in Oregon, regardless of ownership and business operating model Correlate patient care to level of competency required by practitioners (DT, DMD, DDS, DH); hold entities accountable to the level of licenses within their practice Implement changes to Licensee Renewal form to capture multiple office/group affiliation Gather dental practice ownership and training information Analyze complaints by ownership types Receive OHSU updated curriculum and include in Board Book Evaluate options for strengthening statute related to accountability, ownership, and standards of care Goals Action Items Attachment #6Oregon Board of Dentistry 2022 -2025 Strategic Plan 9 STRATEGIC PRIORITY C Community Interaction and Equity The Oregon Board of Dentistry recognizes that systemic inequities exist in our society which have resulted in practices that have not always provided equitable access to dental care across our community. Protecting the Community has always been at the center of the Oregon Board of Dentistry Mission. Fairness and equity are imbedded in the OBD Values. The OBD believes it can do more to address the systemic inequities that have existed and ensure more fully that our mission and values apply to everyone. Communicate and market to reach the diverse communities within Oregon Increase ease of access to OBD services Ensure equity exists in Investigation outcomes Increase OBD Licensee, patient, and community understanding of OBD roles, responsibilities, and services Align Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion plans to guidance provided by the State of Oregon Racial Justice Council Include diversity analysis when developing Marketing or Communications materials; consider diversity in visual representations Enable OBD to take complaints in complainant's first language Create analysis of prior investigations, findings, and actions across Licensee demographics to frame equity -related data Goals Action Items Attachment #6Oregon Board of Dentistry 2022 -2025 Strategic Plan 10 STRATEGIC PRIORITY D Workplace Environment The COVID -19 pandemic, technology advances, talent supply/demand issues as well as numerous factors affecting employee expectations of the work environment are driving the need for changes to work environments worldwide. OBD has previously been limited in ability to offer more flexible work location options due to technological limitations. Those limitations are easing, allowing for secure and effective ways to access needed information while employees work from home or other remote locations. Offering this flexibility will likely increase employee satisfaction while at the same time enabling increased efficiency. In addition to flexible work arrangements, employees also desire clear expectations and recognition for their work as well as fair and equitable processes for advancing their careers. OBD investments in these areas should result in increased employee retention. Board succession planning is also critical. Several Board members have terms ending in this next plan horizon. The strategic resource plans extend to the Board as well as employees. Establish succession plan for Board members, continuing to represent many viewpoints and experiences in Board composition Increase workplace flexibility through a hybrid workplace guideline Increase workplace satisfaction and career development conversations Define and implement hybrid workplace guidelines Evaluate overall workload and staff workload balance, consider adjustments for upcoming fiscal cycles Develop succession plans for Board positions coming open and establish effective process for ongoing timely replacement Goals Action Items Attachment #6Oregon Board of Dentistry 2022 -2025 Strategic Plan 11 STRATEGIC PRIORITY E Technology & Processes All organizations are affected by technology developments, and Oregon Board of Dentistry and the dental profession is no exception. The OBD has the strategic opportunity to implement processes and tools that will improve efficiency, employee and Board member experience as well as improve the effectiveness of processes for dental professional engaged with OBD. In addition, growing advances in data collection and analysis will enable the ability to continue to ensure fair and equitable outcomes for applicants and Licensees. Improve efficiency and resource utilization through online record keeping Increase ability to complete analytics related to licensees and investigations Improve investigation case management with archived files Complete digitization and modernization process for Board Books Complete implementation of InLumon system Build working digital database of Licensee records Create digital archive of investigation files Pilot data analysis capabilities Goals Action Items Attachment #6Oregon Board of Dentistry 2022 -2025 Strategic Plan 12 Oregon Board of Dentistry Strategic Plan 2022- 2025 Mission: To promote quality oral health care and protect all communities in the State of Oregon by equitably and ethically regulating dental professionals.

EFFECTIVE DATE: 08/01/2023 Stephen Prisby Rules Coordinator NEED FOR THE RULE(S): The Oregon Board of Dentistry is primarily funded by application fees and license renewal fees paid to it. A fee increase us needed to fund its continuing operations. JUSTIFICATION OF TEMPORARY FILING: The 2023 Legislative Session ended close to the start of the new 2023-2025 Biennium. A temporary rule is allowed so the Oregon Board of Dentistry (OBD) can implement fee increases that were approved by the Legislature with HB 5011. The rule will be made permanent before the expiration date of the temporary rule. The fee increases are needed to cover the ongoing costs and expenses of the OBD. The last fee increase was in 2015 . The OBD is funded primarily (96%) by its Licensees, so the fee increase is needed and justified to cover the OBD's related expenses in its operation. DOCUMENTS RELIED UPON, AND WHERE THEY ARE AVAILABLE: The OBD's 2023-2025 Budget document, budget materials presented in board meeting and presentations to the Oregon Legislature. AMEND: 818-001-0087 RULE SUMMARY: The OBD has authorization from the Legislature to adopt and raise fees. The fee increases are included in the OBD budget bill, HB 5011 (2023). The fee increases are needed to continue funding the OBD at its current service level and through the 2023 -2025 budget biennium. There have been no fee increases since 2015 and the OBD is supported primarily (96% of all revenue) from fees collected from applicants and its licensees. This temporary rule will be made permanent before the end of 2023.

These standards outline that trained dentists are the only clinicians with the knowledge and skills to safely and effectively provide oral appliance therapy for obstructive sleep apnea. Since that time, we have become aware of the growth of two different business models that provide unsuspecting patients with an oral appliance, but without the appropriate inclusion of a trained dentist in the provision of care. We are writing to make you aware of these business models and our concerns about the quality and safety of providing oral appliance t herapy by a non- dentist. In one of these models, medical assistants, and physician assistants under the supervision of an otolaryngologist - who may or may not see the patient - are taking dental impressions, having a singular designated appliance fabricated, and hand the appliance to the patient. In another model, durable medical equipment suppliers are making an oral appliance available for a patient to purchase directly through an online store, either with an impression kit that the patient uses at home or without impressions but instead with instructions for the patient to mold the trays to their teeth at home, by themselves. We'd like to make you aware of the quality and safety concerns with these situations: The selection of an oral appliance should be made by a trained dentist based on an in- person evaluation of the patient. Only dentists have the education and experience to evaluate the patient's dentition and oral tissues and structures to identify all possible contraindications and to determine which of the many available oral appliances is the most appropriate to provide effective treatment with good retention to the teeth and the lowest risk of discomfort or side effects. In addition, the choice of oral appliance should be made in conjunction with the patient taking into consideration their sleep habits, ability to or comfort with advancing the appliance, as well as concerns about cost. Impressions should be taken by dentists or trained dental assistants. Whether taken digitally or with traditional dental materials, accurate impressions are essential to a properly fitted and effective oral appliance. The current literature does not show a clear difference in the impact of a digital vs traditional impression; however, an inexpert impression whether taken by an unfamiliar adjunct healthcare employee or by the patient themselves can miss important dental structures that are essential to the proper fit and function of the appliance. The patient should receive follow -up care for the lifetime of the appliance and for as long as the patient wishes to use oral appliance therapy. The direct -to-consumer model offers no follow up care and leaves the patient at risk for ineffective control of symptoms, harmful side effects, and the risk of abandoning needed t reatment of a medical condition that can negatively impact health. In the ENT clinic model of care, we are aware of patients who have been referred to their general dentist for the correction of problems caused by the ENT - delivered appliance, rather than appropriately followed and treated by a qualified dentist, preferably the same dentist who evaluated the patient, selected, and delivered the appliance. The goal of the AADSM is to provide patients with access to safe, high- quality care. Oral appliance therapy is a proven, effective treatment if provided by a licensed dentist who has had additional training in dental sleep medicine and stays current through continuing education. Only qualified dentists such as these know how to select appropriate appliances to ensure the most effective treatment, prevent potential side effects, and manage and resolve side effects that do occur. Medicare's coverage for obstructive sleep apnea (LCD33611) and most commercial payers require a qualified dentist to provide oral appliance therapy, based not only on the AADSM standards for practice but also on clinical guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and other scientific guidelines that confirm this therapy as within the scope of dentistry. Should issues or concerns about non- dentist provide oral appliance therapy come to your attention, we are happy to be a resource to you as you consider the appropriate role of dentists and other providers in the care of patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Sincerely, Mitchell Levine, DMD, MS The Oregon Dental Association represents over 2,100 dentists practicing in all corners of the State and the Oregon Dental Hygiene Association membership including over 600 licensees, with a combined membership of over 2,700 licensees statewide. Our two organizations write to formally request that the Oregon Board of Dentistry consider changes to the mental health questions that are currently part of the licensing process. Recogni zing the need to reduce stigma around mental health, the Oregon Medical Board recently moved to an attestation model in line with the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation's recommendations. Yet, the line of questioning used by the Oregon Board of Dentistry during licensing remains outdated and stigmatizing\u2014even though, according to the American Dental Association, the suicide rate amongst dentists is even higher than that of physicians, \"Male dentists hold the highest suicide rate at 8.02 percent. Female dentists hold the fourth highest suicide rate at 5.28 percent. Physicians (7.87 percent), pharmacists (7.19 percent) and nurses (6.56 percent) also hold suicide rates much higher than the national average\". Notably, this data was gathered before the COVID -19 pandemic. More recently, the 2021 Dentist Well- Being Survey Report by the American Dental Association revealed that the percentage of dentists diagnosed with anxiety more than tripled in 2021 compared with 2003. Yet, providers report that they are fearful to seek the help that they need. In recognition that healthcare providers encounter mental health and substance use disorders, the Oregon Medical Board uses the below form and wording for initial licensure and renewal. the Oregon Dental Association and the Oregon Dental Hygiene Association respectfully urge the Oregon Board of Dentistry to adopt similar language to replace stigmatizing language currently being used. Thank you for your consideration. Mark Miller, DMD Tracy Lynne Brunkhorst President, ODA RDH, EPDH, FADHA President ODHA OMB Adopting Mental Health Attestation Model for Licensure and Renewal Applications The Oregon Medical Board recognizes that licensees encounter personal health conditions, including mental health and substance use disorders, just as their patients and fellow health care providers do. According to a 2022 survey conducted by The Physicians Foundation, nearly 40% of providers were afraid (or knew a colleague who was afraid) to seek mental health care beca use of questions asked as part of medical licensure or credentialing applications. The Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation challenged all medical boards to audit licensure and renewal mental health questions, change invasive or stigmatizing language, and communicate these changes to licensees. To better support licensees in seeking the care they need without anxiety or trepi dation, on April 6, 2023, the Board voted to remove intrusive and stigmatizing language around mental health care and treatment from licensure applications and renewals. The advisory statement uses supportive language around mental health and holds license es and applicants accountable for their own well -being. The model makes it clear that self -care is patient care. The advisory statement and attestation were included in applications effective June 1, 2023: Personal History Questions for Licensure Application Personal History Questions for Licensure Renewal While there is still work to be done, this is a significant step in removing barriers to support and protecting licens ees' mental health and wellbeing.

Secondly, please find a copy of the closing report from the project sponsor. Please note, this is one of two reports from the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board. The final report is due to OHA in Nov ember. I want to thank you each for your time. We began this work in 2016 and we met a total of 16 times, each time for about two hours. Several of you have been with the committee from the very beginning and graciously attended site visits throughout the State of Oregon, assisting OHA with meeting our obligations and responsibilities. We greatly appreciate all of your time, enthusiasm and subject -matter expertise. Sincerely, Sarah Kowalski Sarah Kowalski, MS, RDH Dental Pilot Projects: Oral Health Program Operations Sarah Kowalski, MS, RDH (she/her) Oral Health Operations & Policy Analyst Dental Pilot Project Program OREGON HEALTH AUTHORITY Public Health Division sarah.e.kowalski@dhsoha.state.or.us 2121 SW Broadway , Suite 300 | Portland, OR 97201 | (503) 228 -4185 | npaihb.org July 18, 2023 Via Email Transmission Sarah Kowalski, RDH, MS Dental Pilot Project Program Oregon Health Authority RE: Oregon Dental Pilot Project #100 Discontinuation Dear Ms. Kowalski: We are writing to inform you of the discontinuation of Dental Pilot Project #100 (DPP #100), effective May 31, 2023. Please accept this letter to meet the project requirement of submitting a closing report within two months after the project's end date. Reason for Discontinuation: DPP #100 was approved in and began in 2016. The project's original end date, 5 years after initiation, was May 31, 2021. The project then requested and was granted two consecutive requests to extend its duration by one year each. These requests were submitted to allow project participants to continue to serve their communities until the option to work under authority of a state license was available. This option became available via the Oregon Board of Dentistry in September 2022 (following passage of authorizing legislation, HB 2528, in 2021). In fall and winter of 2022-2023, DPP #100 participants were able to go through the required processes and received Oregon state dental therapy licenses. By May of 2023, all participating clinics had exited DPP #100 and the project was no longer needed. Summary of Dental Pilot Project #100: Clinics: Three clinics participated in Pilot Project #100: - Native American Rehabilitation Association (NARA) - Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians (CTCLUSI) - Ko-Kwel Wellness Center - a clinic of the Coquille Indian Tribe (Ko-Kwel) Participants: The project included a total of six participants. Five of these participants completed the training phase: attendance and graduation from the Alaska Dental Therapy Education Program (ADTEP) at Ilisagvik College. One participant was a previous graduate of ADTEP, so did not participate in the training phase during DPP #100 participation; he was able to begin his DPP #100 participation in the utilization phase. Five of the project participants participated in the Sarah Kowalski, RDH, MS July 18, 2023 Page 2 employment/utilization phase, which included a 400+ hour direct-supervision preceptorship: two at NARA, two at CTCLUSI, and one at Ko-Kwel. Four of the participants have applied for and received a dental therapy license from the Oregon Board of Dentistry. DPP #100 adhered to a thorough evaluation and monitoring plan protocol. As part of this, quarterly detailed data reports of all completed procedures were sent to the Oregon Health Authority including chart reviews from an outside dental reviewer. Additionally, a lengthy quarterly narrative detailing specific clinic updates was provided as well. The Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) is proud to have sponsored this Dental Pilot Project #100. The strong record of safety and efficacy that DPP#100 dental therapists demonstrated led to passage of legislation authorizing this profession statewide in 2021, which we trust will lead to improved access to high quality dental care for more communities in Oregon for future generations. We have appreciated this opportunity for Tribal communities to work with the Oregon Health Authority toward a shared goal of supporting optimal health in Oregon. Sincerely, Laura Platero, JD Executive Director Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board Page 1 of 1 July 1 4, 2023 TO: Advisory Committee Members Dental Pilot Project #100 FROM: Sarah E. Kowalski, MS, RDH Dental Pilot Project Program Coordinator RE: Conclusion of Dental Pilot Project #100 and Advisory Committee Dear Advisory Committee Member , The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) would like to thank you for your service as an Advisory Committee member for Dental Pilot Project #100 \"Oregon Tribes Dental Health Aide Therapist Pilot Project \". We want to t hank you for the time, talent, and subject -matter expertise you have given to the Dental Pilot Project Program through your active participation on the Advisory Committee. Your ideas, input, and enthusiasm were most helpful and have assisted OHA in meeting its responsibilities of the Program . The goal of the Dental Pilot Project Program is to offer a unique opportunity to address health disparities and create more equitable oral health care d elivery systems by testing innovative ways to improve oral health practice, workforce, and access. Dental pilot projects are community driven and intentionally designed to increase access to dental care for communities of color and other populations which evidence -based studies have shown to have the highest dental disease rates and the least access to dental care. In 2021 , legislation was passed which resulted in the authorization of dental therapists in Oregon. Dental therapists are now a recognized lic ensed provider type and are overseen by the Oregon Board of Dentistry. Licensed dental therapists are required to provide 51% of their services to individuals who are part of historically underserved populations.1 On May 31, 2023, Dental Pilot Project #100 officially concluded. The project sponsor will be submitting a required final report of findings to OHA in late November 2023. The final report is based on the Evaluation & Monitoring Plan and any subsequent modifications approved by OHA . The Advisory Committee will not hold any further meetings. The final report will be disseminated to all committee members and posted online for review. Again, thank you for your contributions, time, and effort while serving on this advisory committee. 1 Oregon Administrative Rule 409 -017-0121 CENTER FOR PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION Oral Health Program Tina Kotek , Governor 800 NE Oregon St, Ste 825 Portland, Oregon 97232 -2186 Office: 971 -673-1563 | 1 Title: OBD Tribal Relationship & Cooperation Policy Effective Date: February 25, 2022 Purpose: The State of Oregon and the Oregon Board of Dentistry (OBD) share the goal to establish clear policies establishing the tribal consultation and requirements to further the government- to- government relationship between the OBD and the nine federally recognized Tribes of Oregon (Oregon Tribes) with the passage of HB 2528 (2021) and on any other matters that are important to the Tribes. This policy shall fulfill the requirements of ORS 182.164 & ORS 182.166. Nine Federally Recognized Tribes of Oregon (\"Oregon Tribes\") : Burns Pa iute Tribe Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Confederated of Grande Ronde Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation Conf ede rated Tribes of Warms Springs Coquille Indian Tribe Cow Cr eek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians Klamath Tribes Other Organizations Urban Indian Health Programs (UIHP) Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) This P olicy: Identi fies individuals within the OBD who are responsible for developing and implementing programs , rules, policies and draft legislation that affect Tribes. Establishes a process to identify the OBD programs , rules, policies and draft legislation that impact Tribes. Promotes communication between the OBD and the Tribes. Promotes positive government -to-government relations between the OBD and Tribes. Promotes positive relationships with any entity that serves tribal members including theNorthwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and Urban Indian Health Programs Establishes a method for ensuring that OBD employees comply with ORS 182.162 to 182.168 and this policy. Streamlined for ease to understand and apply: the OBD is a small agency with 8 employees. This Policy is to meet compliance with ORS 182.164, but also should be utilized in working with any tribal group, entity or organization that supports tribal members and is impacted by the OBD 's work. Meani ngful consultation between tribal leadership and agency leadership shall result in information exchange, transparency, mutual understanding, and informed decision- making on Page | 2 behalf of the Oregon Tribes and the State. One key goal of this policy is to prevent avoidable surprises between the OBD and Oregon Tribes. Othe r key goals of this policy include , but are not limited to: helping to eliminate health and human service disparities of Indians; ensuring that access to critical health and human services is maximized; advancing and enhancing the social, physical, behavioral and oral health of Indians; making accommodations in State programs when possible to account for the unique nature of Indian health programs; collaborating on the development and improvement of programs , rules, policies and draft legislation ; and ensuring that the Oregon Tribes are consulted to ensure meaningful and timely tribal input as required under Federal and State law when health and human service policies have an impact on Indians and the Oregon Tribes. To achieve this goal, and to the extent practicable and permitted by law, it is essential that the Oregon Tribes and the OBD engage in open, continuous and meaningful consultation and collaboration. This policy applies to the OBD (Board Members and staff) and shall serve as a guide for the Oregon Tribes to participate in OBD legislative, rule and policy development to the greatest extent allowable under law. The relationship between the OBD and the Oregon Tribes is important and should be on a foundation of trust and mutual respect. It is important for the OBD to work closely with Oregon Tribes on issues related to Dental Therapy and any other matter that is important to the Oregon Tribes. Policy #8 34-413-019 OBD Tribal Relationship & Cooperation Policy Effective Date: February 25, 2022 App licability: All Board Members , full and part time employees, temporary employees and volunteers Refe rences: (1) Purpose This tribal relations policy is adopted pursuant to ORS 182.162 - 182.168, which requires state agencies to develop and implement tribal relations poli cies. (2) General Policies and Principles It is OBD 's policy to promote the principle stated in Executive Order No.96- 30 that \"[a]s sovereigns the tribes and the State of Oregon must work together to develop mutual respect for the sovereign interests of both parties.\" OBD interacts with tribes in differing roles: in its role as legal advisor to and representative of other state agencies; and in its role as independent administrator of certain OBD programs. In all of its roles, it is OBD 's policy to promote positive government to government relations with the federally recognized tribes in Oregon (\"tribes\") by (a) Facilitating communication and understanding and appropriate dispute resolution among OBD , other state agencies and those tribes; (b) Striving to prevent unnecessary conflict with tribes; (c) Interacting with tribes in a spirit of mutual respect; (d) Involving tribal representatives in the development and implementation of programs, rules, policies and draft legislation that affect them; and (e) Seeking to understand the varying tribal perspectives. (3) The OBD's Native American Affairs Coordinator is the OBD's Executive Director (a) The state is best served through a coordinated approach to tribal issues. The OBD's Executive Director has been designated as the OBD's Native American Affairs Coordinator, who serves as the OBD's key contact with tribal representatives. (b) Individuals at the OBD who are working on a significant matter involving or affecting a tribe Page | 3 shall notify the Native American Affairs Coordinator. (4) Dissemination of Tribal Relations Policy (a) Upon adoption, this policy shall be disseminated to members of the OBD , and shall be incorporated into the OBD Policy Manual. In addition, this policy and information regardi ng ORS 182.162 - 168 shall be included in new Board Member and employee orientation.

(8) Guidelines for OBD Programs The OBD will invite tribal participation on Dental Therapy issues and other areas of interest t hat the Tribes bring forth to the OBD. OBD Commitment to Tribal Consultation The O BD was established by the Oregon State Legislature in 1887 and is accountable to the people of Oregon, acknowledges this unique relationship, the statutory and regulatory framework for states to consult with Tribes, and recognizes the right of Indian tribes to self - determination and self -governance. The special government -to-government r elationship between the Tribes and federal and state governments will be respected in all dealings with the Tribes and OBD. Relationship of State Agencies with Indian Tribes, ORS 182.162 to 182.168. In order to fully effectuate this policy, OBD will: Ensure inclusion of the Tribes prior to the development of policies and program activities that impact Tribes, utilizing the OBD's formal notice that provides descriptive content and a timeline of all public meetings ; Create opportunities for Tribes to raise issues with the OBD and for the OBD to seek consultation with Tribes; Establish communication channels with Tribes to increase knowledge and understanding of OBD programs; Support tribal self -determination; Include on every regular Board Meeting Agenda an opportunity for the Tribes to directly communicate with the OBD. Tri bal Consultation Principles: Consul tation is an enhanced form of communication that emphasizes trust, respect and shared responsibility. It is an open and free exchange of information and opinion among parties, which leads to mutual understanding and comprehension. Consultation includes collaboration and often results in an iterative process between parties. Meaningful consultation is integral to a Page | 4 deliberative process that results in effective collaboration and informed decision- making, with the ultimate goal of reaching consensus on issues and better outcomes . To establish and maintain a positive government -to-government relationship, meaningful communication and consultation must occur on a regular and as needed basis so that Tribes have an opportunity to provide meaningful, and timely input on issues that may have an impact on Tribes. This government -to-government relationship applies between the Tribes and the State. Consul tation with the Tribes is important in the context of health programs because the Tribes serve many roles in their communities: Tri bes and tribal governments are sovereign nations with inherent authority over their internal affairs; have a government -to-government relationship with the feder al government, state governments, and other sovereigns; and have the responsibility toensure the health and well- being of their tribal citizens, among various other governmental responsibilities. Tribal governments operate businesses, are employers, and are health care providers,through administration of clinics and other health programs, which includes public health Polic y Action It is the intent of OBD to meaningfully consult with Tribes on any rule change s, policy, programs , rules and draft legislation that will impact the Tribes before any action is taken. Such r ule changes or policies include those that: Have Indian or Tribal implications; or Have implications on the Indian Health Service, tribal health programs or urban Indianhealth program, or Have a direct effect on one or more Tribes, or Have a direct effect on the relationship between the state and Tribes, or Have a direct effect on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the state and Tribes; or Are a federally or statutorily mandated proposal or change in which OBD has flexibility in implementation. Tri bal Consultation Process: An ef fective consultation between the OBD and the Tribes requires trust between all parties which is an indispensable element in establishing a good consultative relationship. Any Issue includes, but is not limited to: Polic y, programs , rules and draft legislation development impacting the Tribes; Program activities that impacting Tribes; Data collection and reporting activities impacting Tribes; Rulemaking impacting Tribes; or Any other OBD action impacting Tribes or that has implications on the NPAIHB, tribal health programs or IHS.Page | 5 Upon identification of any Issue meeting any of the above criteria the OBD will initiate consultation regarding the issue. To initiate and conduct consultation, the following serves as a guideline to be utilized by the OBD and the Tribes: Identify the Issue : complexity, implications, time constraints, deadlines and issue(s). Identify how the Issue impacts the Tribes. Identify affected/potentially affected Tribes. Determining Consultation Mechanism: The most useful and appropriate consultation mechanisms can be determined by OBD and Tribes after considering the Issue and Tribes affected/potentially affected. Consultation mechanisms include but are not limited to one or more of the following: Email Teleconferences Virtual Meetings Face- to-Face Meetings at regular Board or Committee Meetings Other regular or special consultation sessions needed. Communication Methods: The determination of the Issue and the level of consultation mechanism to be used by OBD shall be communicated to affected/potentially affected Tribes using all appropriate methods and with as much advance notice as practicable or as required under this policy. These methods include but are not limited to the following: Official Notification: Upon the determination of the consultation mechanism, proper notice of the Issue and the consultation mechanism utilized shall be communicated to affected/potentially affected Tribes using all appropriate methods including mailing and broadcast e- mail. Such notice shall be provided to: Tribal Chair or Chief and their designated representative(s) Any other entity that the Tribes identify that should be included The OBD will regular ly update its mailing/email list to ensure notice is being provided to designated leadership. Each Tribe is responsible for providing this information to OBD's Executive Director to regularly update the list. Rulem aking: The OBD will include the Tribes in all legislative, rulemaking and policy making processes that have tribal implications. The T ribes will have a regular and open invitation to attend any OBD Committee meeting or public rulemaking hearing to provide additional input on rule concepts and language. Creation of Committees/Work Group(s): Round tables and work groups may be used for discussions, problem resolution, and preparation for communicati on and consultation related to an Issue but do not replace formal tribal consultation. Round tables and work groups will provide the opportunity for technical assistance from the OBD to Indian health programs and the Tribes to address challenges or barriers and work collaboratively on development of solutions to bring to the meetings. Page | 6 Implementation Process and Responsibilities: The process should be reviewed and evaluated for effectiveness as requested. Tribal Consultation Evaluation: The OBD is responsible for evaluating its performance under this Tribal Consultation Policy. To effectively evaluate the results of the consultation process and the ability of the OBD to incorporate tribal recommendations, the OBD may assess its performance on an annual basis in the Executive Director's performance review or as needed. Meeting Records and Additional Reporting : The OBD is responsible for making and keeping records of all public meetings and its tribal consultation activity. All such records s hall be made readily available to the Tribes.

[2] Newsletters & Articles of Interest 1 CRDTS Report info@crdts.org 785-273-0380 The CRDTS Report Central Regional Dental Testing Service, Inc. Spring 2023 Over 50 Years of Testing Excellence partners in Europe, SIMtoCARE, to develop virtual haptic technology that augments our examinations and remedia-tion. The CRDTS CARE Program has been developed and is available for dental boards to obtain reliable and verifiable remediation results when needed for licensees. Our orga-nization is making progress and growing, and with all this increased activity, our amazing Central Office staff manages to continue to build schedules, arrange meetings, organize exam supplies, handle finances, and crunch exam data with accuracy and efficiency. We are also fortunate to have an Executive Director who has worked extremely hard to gain an understanding of our organization and profession so that she can communicate effectively in any situation. As a result of that process, she has developed a tenacious loyalty to CRDTS. There is no question that what I have just described is the definition of great teamwork by an outstanding team. CRDTS has an excellent group of examiners to draw from when leadership asks for help to achieve goals, so the re-sponse is usually quick and effective. Even so, sometimes it feels like the hard work, long hours, and extra effort result in ever so small gains. So as individual members of a great team, if you have a small victory in whatever you are doing for CRDTS, and it helps your psyche to beat on your chest and scream like a banshee, I say go for it! All your efforts are appreciated! EXPRESS YOURSELF For those of us who enjoy watching sports of almost any variety, football, basketball, track, baseball, it doesn't mat-ter, there is something we see at nearly every contest. It is the vision of some participant who has just completed an amaz-ing feat of athleticism, who in an expression of self-approval beats on his chest like Tarzan, thrusts his arms with fingers pointed skyward and bellows a primal howl that would wake the dead. This could happen at any point in the game when the outcome is still uncertain............Is that really necessary? I didn't used to think so, but I have changed my mind lately. If someone wants to beat on their chest because they have devoted countless hours of hard work and prepa-ration to accomplish something, then praise the Lord for the opportunity and ability to do it, they have every right. I feel that way now because for the better part of two years I have been working with a group of people at CRDTS who deserve to beat on their chest some. CRDTS dental hygiene has increased exam sites by over 25% the previous year. That doesn't just happen by accident. It is the result of great pub-lic relations, exam content, exam administration, coopera-tion and coordination with Central Office staff, outstanding leadership from their professional staff and committees, and a high level of performance from their examiners. CRDTS dental has streamlined the administration of their exam, re-vamped all the manuals, and with excellent professional staff leadership and ad hoc committee work, has developed and instituted a psychometrically valid and pertinent diagnosis and treatment planning written exam to supplement the clinical exams. All of the independent test sites, developed through the vision and commitment of the Executive and Steering Committees, have hosted multiple dental exams to supplement our school-based exams.

DDSSam Jacoby. DDS Report info@crdts.org 785-273-0380CRDTS AND THE STATE DENTAL BOARDS One thing I've come to un- derstand better in my role as Executive Director for CRDTS is the importance of the state dental boards and each state dental board member, not only monitoring dental profession- als in their state, but in understanding the content, criteria, and scoring for each of the dental licensure examinations. By working with dental testing agencies to ensure the most valid, reliable, and fair initial licensure examinations are administered, the state dental boards take the first step to ensure graduates are competent to enter the world and pro-vide safe service to the public. It is because of the important work of each and every state dental and dental hygiene board or commission member that the United States has the highest quality of dental and oral health care available. As a national examining agency with more than 50 years of testing excellence, CRDTS' goal is to continue our work with the state dental boards to help you meet your mission. That is why we value the collaboration we have with each of our CRDTS state board Members and why we carefully monitor the rules and regulations of all state dental and dental hygiene boards, including those that are not cur - rently members - to ensure our exams are meeting laws and regulations nationally. CRDTS leadership has gone to great lengths the past couple of years to renew relationships with each state dental board and provide updates regarding the importance of our orga-nization and the development of our exams. That work will continue on a regular basis going forward. We are anxious to visit each and every state dental/dental hygiene board and collaborate with you on the great work we are doing and learn how we can better serve you, with the same goal to protect the safety and welfare of the public in dental care. We encourage you to contact us if there is ever a time you would like to hear from us on any of the great initiatives we are working on. As one of just a few testing agencies in the business, we es- pecially appreciate the great work of the dental boards that are going the extra mile to ensure that each of the initial licensure examinations meets the requirements of their state laws and board rules. For example, one state dental board recently did a thorough review and side by side comparison of each licensure exam and recognized discrepancies in the examinations administered by each testing agency. In January 2023, that state's dental board members voted that the other agency examinations do not meet the standards set out in their state statues and that CRDTS is the only acceptable dental and dental hygiene examination in that state for any clinical exam initiated after November 1, 2022. While the review of each agency exam requires a great deal of work, we appreciate that state boards are not shying away from it and are diligently completing the responsibility they have been charged with. It is through this work that CRDTS continues to provide the gold standard in dental and dental hygiene licensure examinations. Without a regular and thorough review of the examina- tions, it would be difficult to ensure each exam meets the standards set forth by the states. It is for that reason that CRDTS involves the state dental boards in the development and enhancement of our examinations on a regular basis. Who better to have input and decision-making authority on what is best for a dental or dental hygiene examination than state board members? Each CRDTS Member State enjoys a seat on our governing board, our dental exam review com-mittee, and our dental hygiene review committee. Thus, if rules or regulations change that impact our examinations, CRDTS is immediately able to factor that information in our regular review of each examination. Furthermore, state board members are welcomed and encouraged to examine for our agency, so you have firsthand knowledge of how the exams are administered. Without competing agencies to keep each other account- able, the state dental boards run the risk of losing control of the quality of the examination, the costs associated with the exams, and the efficiency in how the exams are admin-istered. A monopoly in any business is a detriment to the public and that is why CRDTS works so hard to continue the more than 50 years of excellence we are known for. Since the day I walked through the doors of my office at CRDTS, I could tell that relationship building was the cor - nerstone of this organization. Our current President Elect, Dr. Otto Dohm, has stated many times that \"CRDTS is all about the people. \" That is a statement that I think everyone associated with CRDTS understands. CRDTS is not just a business. It is an organization made up of genuine, thought provoking, sincere professionals who have the best interest of the public and upcoming dental professionals at heart. It's not about making money. It's about the people! If your state dental board is not currently a member of CRDTS I encourage you to ask why that is. CRDTS is the only dental and dental hygiene testing agency that regu-larly collaborates with each and every one of our members to ensure the best quality exam and the most efficient and professional way of administering every single exam. continued on page 3 Sheli Cobler, Executive Director3 CRDTS Report The Phoenix is a mythological creature that is said to perish only to reinvent itself and rise from the ashes. I am excited to tell you that the Phoenix is not mythical but is in fact embodied in CRDTS today. The CRDTS organiza-tion has retooled, reimagined and reinvigorated itself and is now rising from the ashes! CRDTS, unlike the Phoenix, is not seeing this resurgence via some supernatural power. No, this re-emergence is the fruit of the labors of a dedicated and professional group of people that have devoted themselves to retooling and rei-magining the organization after 50 years. I stated previously that for me, CRDTS is \"all about the people\" and I stand by that statement. The effort expended by individuals for the good of this organization has been and continues to be remarkable. The effort has been relentless. CRDTS has con-ducted itself with professionalism and integrity that should make all members proud. The development and execution of a fluid strategic plan is now showing concrete results. The dental/dental hygiene tests are significantly increased as of last year and there are reasons to expect continued growth. The development and rollout of the CARE program provides a much needed remediation service to dental boards and practitioners throughout the country. This program is an amalgama-tion of the highest tech available in dentistry with industry leaders in continuing education. It will quickly become the national standard for remediation. CRDTS today represents the highest iteration of Dental/ Dental Hygiene testing in the country and the CARE pro-gram is unrivaled. We are growing, we have the products to meet the needs of the profession, but we must continue to rise from the ashes. The work has been started but we have more to do. Where do we go? We must continue to modify and improve upon our exams to ensure they are the gold standard. The quest to have every state board accept CRDTS results as meeting the requirements for licensure will remove more impediments to CRDTS providing testing at various schools. The rollout of the CARE program and marketing to state boards should increase activity at the Topeka testing site as the years prog-ress. The rise is not complete. We must continue to push forward, encourage and support each other. We must be imaginative, creative and rigorous in our effort. We can't compromise our principles or our integrity but we can move forward. I would urge all to recommit to the endeavor. It is a quest worthy of the effort. I am humbled to be a part of this group.Thank you to all CRDTS Members! Y our participation in the development and continued enhancement of the initial dental and dental hygiene licensure examinations is crucial to the quality of minimal competency assessments for newly graduating dental professionals as they enter the workforce. Y our voice matters to us!! If your state is not already a member and you would like more information about becoming a member of CRDTS, please contact me at richael@crdts.org or 785.273.0380.

Otto Dohm, DDSOtto Dohm, DDS President Elect CRDTS Report info@crdts.org 785-273-0380MID-YEAR CHECK-IN I cannot believe it is already almost halfway through 2023! Looking back at our New Y ear's Resolutions, how are we all doing? I made a resolution to be more positive, to keep a more open mind when pre-sented with difficult situations, and to think longer before I spoke. Depending on who you talk to, I am either doing amazing or failing spectacularly! Another resolution was to spend more time dedicated to CRDTS, taking the role seriously and among other respon-sibilities, trying to improve upon the amazing Annual Meet - ing we had in 2022. It will be a tall order to do better than last year's Annual Meeting, but we will surely try. This year, the meeting will be held in Kansas City on August 25th-26th. The feedback we received from the last meeting was overwhelmingly positive and our plan is to bring you some more dynamic speakers to help you with your CE needs, in a location that is near all of the action. The hotel is located in the heart of a shopping district and just a short ride away from end-less downtown possibilities. We have also restructured the schedule for Saturday's events so that everyone is able to attend all of the events and we are excited to bring back Casino Night after the President's Dinner! As a member of the Executive Committee, I am excited by the goals we are setting for ourselves - to do better for our candidates, our state board members, and for you. I am pleased by the achievements CRDTS has made this past year with commitments from schools for additional exams, improved relationships with program directors and deans of dental schools, and candidates utilizing our independent exam options. Our professional and administrative staff is among the best I have seen in any organization, which bodes well for our future growth and success. Looking forward to seeing you all soon, Andrew Johnston, RDHAndrew Johnston, RDH Vice President Andrew Johnston, RDH Vice President The CRDTS Dental Hygiene team is excited to announce the official release of the Clinical Calibration and Assessment Program (CCAP) Program. This program has been occurring in a trial form for the last two years. It has been presented to approximately 15 dental hygiene programs that have stated the CRDTS CCAP Program is beneficial for the calibration of all their faculty - new and experienced, and well worth the time to help their programs become even better. Available to all dental hygiene programs across the nation and U.S. territories, the CCAP program will assist dental hygiene programs and their clinical faculty with some of the accreditation requirements for the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). The Program can be given in conjunction with a dental hygiene exam or independently and a nominal fee will be charged. With over 50 years of expertise in calibrating examiners, CRDTS can work with your program to help ensure your faculty is adequately calibrated to each other. We can also help you review your current calibration plan and discuss methods that will help with improving and/or maintaining calibration. Some of the benefits include: Documentation for CODA accreditation CE credit available Methodology discussions Hand Skills calibration Clinical assessment that includes your current grading criteria for clinic Watch your email for more details and if you are not on our email list currently but would like information, please send a note to info@crdts.org and we will make sure you get added to the list.CRDTS DENTAL HYGIENE CCAP PROGRAM COMING JANUARY 2024!5 CRDTS Report info@crdts.org 785-273-0380An email with instructions for registration and travel has been sent out and may also be found at www.crdts.org/AnnualMeeting. 7:30 AM - 6:00 PM Committee MeetingsTHURSDAY, AUGUST 24 see you at the plaza! 7:30 AM - 3:30 PM 4:00 PM - 4:45 PM 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM 7:00 PM - 9:30 PMCommittee Meetings State Board Meet & Greet Happy Hour (Cash Bar) President's Dinner - Past Presidents Recognized Retiree RecognitionCasino NightFRIDAY, AUGUST 25 7:30 AM - 9:00 AM 8:00 PM - 9:45 AM 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM 11:10 AM - 12:40 PM 12:45 PM - 1:45 PM 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM 3:15 PM - 5:00 PM 3:15 PM - 5:00 PMContinental Breakfast Business Meeting CE Speaker CE Speaker Luncheon Dental Exam Changes 2024 Dental Hygiene Changes 2024 Dental Educator's Meeting Dental Hygiene Educator's MeetingSATURDAY, AUGUST 266 CRDTS Report info@crdts.org 785-273-0380FROM THE OFFICES OF THE DENTAL EXAM REVIEW COMMITTEE CHAIR AND THE DIRECTOR OF DENTAL EXAMINATIONS Here's hoping that 2023 is off to a safe and strong start for all. The CRDTS Dental ERC has been busy continuing to modify simulated patient examination typodonts as well as simulated patient content, criteria, and policy. Following careful psychometric review and analysis of simulated patient examination scoring and candidate performance statistics from 2019-2022, Dr. Brett Foley of Alpine Testing Solutions has supported a modification to the retake policy for all procedures within the CRDTS simulated patient exams. Beginning in the 2023-2024 Dental testing year (Class of 2024), candidates will be able to bank all procedures passed, and only retake those procedures with less than a 75% score. CRDTS continues to embrace and explore new avenues and the impact of technology in dental and dental hygiene licensure assessment, education, and remediation. CRDTS continues to work in a collaborative relationship with SIM-toCARE to develop and refine virtual haptic technology to be used in education and remediation at our independent testing site in Topeka, KS. CRDTS has also entered into a partnership agreement with Acadental relative to utiliz-ing Teo virtual reality technology as a remediation tool for distance learning via 3-D evaluation and critique of licensee work.CRDTS dental leadership on February 17-19 attended the American Student Dental Association (ASDA) meeting in Seattle, Washington, and also attended the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) meeting in Portland, OR on March 11-14. These events provided excellent oppor - tunities to share the CRDTS vision and mission with both students and educators as we continue to spread the word on services that CRDTS can offer in dental examination for initial licensure as well as in remediation/re-training and re-education. Again, the dental leadership team is open to your thoughts and ideas on how we can most effectively serve the par - ties whom we represent. From State Dental boards in their mission to protect the welfare of the public, to dental candidates and dental schools, CRDTS continues to develop and implement fair, valid and reliable scoring criteria and examination policy. Rod Hill, DDSRod Hill, DDS ERC Committee ChairMark Edwards, DDSMark Edwards, DDS Director of Dental Examinations Rod Hill, DDS, ERC Committee Chair Mark Edwards, DDS, Director of Dental Examinations7 CRDTS Report info@crdts.org 785-273-0380CHANGE AND INSPIRATION 2023 is nearly 6 months in or halfway over whichever way you want to look at it! What a successful and eventful year it has been so far! At the end of this year, CRDTS Dental Hy-giene will have completed dental hygiene exams for around 104 schools at more than 90 sites. This means that we will have had an opportunity to provide a fair, valid, and reliable dental hygiene examination to more than 1500 candidates in our member states. (These numbers are estimates and projections for 2024 are even higher!) A BIG change is the increased number of total examinations that CRDTS is able to provide for not only Dental Hygiene but also Restorative Auxiliary, Written Anesthesia, and Clinical Anesthesia Examinations. Our CRDTS Dental Hy-giene Leadership Team is also collaborating with our Dental Leadership to refine our Dental Therapy Examination. This was the first Dental Therapy Examination ever given in the United States and that was in Minnesota! Now DT is an even bigger national change as seven states have already voted to accept Dental Therapy Candidates for licensure. Several more states are either considering it or have already voted on accepting mid-level providers for the benefit of the public we serve and to help with the shortage of dental professionals that we are currently facing. It is an exciting time to be in the dental and dental hygiene testing field and we know that more changes are on the horizon. Another BIG change is the increase in exam sites that are only hosting the CRDTS simulated (manikin) examina-tion. With the Dental Boards of Georgia, New Mexico, and Wyoming moving to a permanent acceptance of the simu-lated examination (instead of the emergency actions that were taken during COVID) we are seeing a decrease in the number of patient-based examinations. Some candidates are more comfortable using a live patient for testing and we are able to accommodate them with creative planning and scheduling by some of the talented members of the CRDTS Dental Hygiene Team. Research says that change is good for our brains and lives - so look out to the Dental World as you hear and have an op-portunity to learn more about what we have been working so hard on! Y ou will soon be able to acquire more knowl-edge about the CRDTS Clinical Calibration and Assessment Program which is growing and helping dental hygiene pro-grams meet some of the criteria for CODA Accreditation. Y ou can also check out our website to see information about the CRDTS CARE Program that is already assisting State Boards with remediation. It is also a current and efficient method for professionals that want to develop skills they are interested in or need more one-on-one guidance to become clinically competent and more self-confident in their skills and abilities. One thing we know for sure is that to succeed as a dental professional in this day and age you have to de-velop a love for lifelong learning and we all like to advance our skills to be the best that we can be. The World of Artificial Intelligence is another Big Big world change and CRDTS is already advanced far into the ability to use virtual training, the Sim-to-Care digital technol-ogy, TEO software and virtual reality, and MORE. I never really wanted to attempt an endo procedure, prep a crown or bridge, or try placing an implant; but I had opportunities to do all of that at our Educational Facility in Topeka, KS. What an unbelievable opportunity for learning and collabo-rating with our future dental and dental hygiene profession-als and current colleagues. It takes some time to process, along with serious contempla- tion, to grasp how much CRDTS is growing and expand-ing to meet the needs of our dental and dental hygiene programs in our member states plus the State Boards. We at CRDTS are leaders in keeping up with all the changes, challenges, and advances in our beloved profession. We are deeply involved in all the changes and what we are doing as a Testing Organization. We are constantly inspired by the talented, intelligent, and dedicated individuals on our CRDTS team who are forward-thinking and making all this and more happen. We constantly look back and appreciate all the work that was done before us to get us to this point. Everyone is appreciated and valued, including our Execu-tive Director, Sheli Cobler, and all those important, mostly behind-the-scenes, team members who work out of the Central Office and support all of us so that together we can make all this happen. We are all excited about the CHANGES and advances CRDTS is achieving! There is an old saying, \"Hold On Tight\" and also one that says, \"Don't blink so you won't miss anything\" - these sayings appropriately apply to what CRDTS is experiencing now and in our future as we continue to provide excellence in dental hygiene and dental testing. Y our Dental Hygiene Team, Cindy Gaskill, Cindy Gaskill, RDH, MAERDH, Saldana, RDHRDHCRDTS CARE PROGRAM CRDTS is excited to announce the introduction of our new program for remediation and reeducation.

Michigan Ave., Suite 900, Chicago, IL 60611, United States Page 1 Dental Assisting National Board www.danb.orgSTATE OF THE STATES September 2022-May 2023 DANB's compilation of state dental assisting requirements \u2014 on its website and in its state publications \u2014 is one of the most comprehensive resources available on this topic. The updates below highlight recent state legislative and regulatory changes that may be of interest to stakeholders of DANB and the DALE Foundation. Alaska Effective Oct. 5, 2022, SB173 allows a dental hygienist holding an advanced practice permit to delegate to a dental assistant the exposure and development of ra-diographs and application of topical preventive agents and pit and fissure sealants. Colorado A new dental therapist law went into effect Jan. 1, 2023, specifying that an articulated plan between a dentist and dental therapist must include policies for supervising dental assistants. Additionally, effective Nov. 3, 2022, a new board policy specifies that pre - scription-strength whitening systems available only to dentists require direct supervision when used by dental assistants. Florida In June 2019, the Florida Board of Dentistry adopted a rule providing for the delegation of remediable restorative functions to dental assistants who have received required training. On May 18, 2023, the Board amended the rule to add a requirement that, in order to enroll in a restorative functions training program, a dental assistant must have a delegating dentist, and the delegating dentist must supervise and evaluate a portion of clinical requirements for dental assistants receiving restorative functions training. The amended rule further specifies the following: the de legating dentist must attend an online interactive training on the laws and rules of remediable restorative functions and a calibration session for clinical requirements and procedures the 25 ho urs of training dedicated to live patients must be divided between instruction from the delegating dentist consisting of 12 hours and from the course provider institution consisting of 13 hours the pre vious live-patient requirement for training in fitting and contouring but not permanently cementing stainless steel crowns is replaced with a lab, case-based clinical scenario The amendment provides for a rule review in five years. Illinois As part of an effort to address workforce shortages of dental hygienists in urban and rural underserved areas, a new law took effect Jan. 1, 2023, to increase access to dental care by now allowing dental assistants to perform coronal scaling above the gum line on children up to 17 years old (prior age limit was 12 years) who qualify under one of the following provisions: on Medicaid, uninsured, or whose family household income is not higher than 300% (previously was 200%) of the federal poverty level. The legislation also increased the training required from 16 hours to 32 hours for dental assistants to provide this limited service. Iowa New rules went into effect Dec. 21, 2022, that eliminate the formal application process for dental assistant trainee status and allow dental assistants to train on the job for purposes of registration for 12 months from the date of Page 2 Dental Assisting National Board www.danb.orgSTATE OF THE STATES September 2022-May 2023 the start of employment; update requirements for registration as a dental assistant and for qualification in dental radiography; and amend the definition of \"personal supervision\" to allow more flexibility in the training of dental assistant trainees as delegated by a licensed dentist. Additionally, rules related to expanded functions training were updated effective Jan. 18, 2023, and some requirements for dental assistant registration by verification were relaxed April 12, 2023. Missouri A rule clarifying EFDA functions went into effect Sept. 30, 2022, adding \"sizing and cementing prefabricated crowns\" to the EFDA permit in fixed prosthodontics and making minor amendments to clarify language for EFDA functions. Additionally, an emergency rule issued in January 2023 and effective through July 10 initiated a pilot program in dental telehealth. This pilot is a collaboration between the board and the Office of Dental Health within the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services designed to examine new methods of extending dental care to residents in assisted living facilities, intermediate-care facilities, residential-care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and home-bound special-needs patients. Under this rule, the Missouri Dental Board is authorized to issue temporary waivers to dentists to allow for the supervision of dental assistants, certified dental assistants, and EFDAs using telehealth technology. The Missouri Dental Board is to provide a final report on the pilot project by Dec. 31, 2025. New York Effective Aug. 17, 2022, A07754 adds \"placing and removing temporary restorations\" to the list of functions Regis-tered Dental Assistants can perform. Also in 2022, in response to questions received from licensees, the New York State Board for Dentistry determined that an RDA may not perform bleaching procedures because such procedures irreversibly alter tooth enamel. The Board also determined that an RDA may not apply fluoride varnish because the function is listed in the scope of practice for dental hygienists, and that RDAs may not perform those functions that are considered the practice of dental hygiene. Oklahoma Signed by the governor May 5, 2023, Senate Bill 754 adds two new expanded duty permits that a dental assistant may apply for: (1) phlebotomy and venipuncture and (2) elder care and public health. This brings the number of expanded duty permits available to dental assistants in Oklahoma to seven. While it is still unclear what will be required of applicants for the phlebotomy and venipuncture permit, the bill specifies that a minimum of two years of dental assisting practice is necessary to receive the elder care and public health permit. The elder care permit will allow dental assistants to aid hygienists, under the general supervision of a licensed den-tist, in providing treatment to patients in adult and long-term healthcare facilities. Pennsylvania SB 1173, effective Nov. 3, 2022, allows licensees and certificate holders to earn three hours of CE for volunteer prac-tice at a clinic or health center or charity dental event. The law applies to EFDAs, who are state certified and must renew their certificate periodically, as well as to dentists and dental hygienists. Utah Effective March 27, 2023, new rules prohibit the following three tasks from being performed by a dental assistant: starting, or administering medication through, an IV line; converting a denture into a fixed implant prosthesis; and adjusting a permanent or final prosthetic, removable or fixed, that is to be worn by a patient. Washington Signed by the governor May 15, 2023, HB 1678 recognizes licensure for dental therapists statewide and allows for licensed dental therapists to supervise dental assistants and EFDAs. The new law becomes effective Jan. 1, 2024.SmileDirectClub to release customers from NDAs in settlement SmileDirectClub, which provides orthodontic services through the mail, has agreed to release customers who asked for refunds from nondisclosure agreements, as part of a settlement with the District of Columbia's attorney general. The settlement, announced Thursday, allows 17,000 customers to talk publicly about their experiences with SmileDirectClub's teeth aligners, said the attorney general, Brian L. Schwalb. The company previously asked customers who wanted refunds to agree not to discuss their experiences and delete negative social media posts about the company. In 2020, The New York Times reported that SmileDirectClub tied confidentiality agreements to some refunds. T he District of Columbia attorney general's office sued the company in 2022, accusing it of blocking customers who were injured by its services from filing complaints with regulators or law enforcement. \"SmileDirectClub promised a simple, safe and affordable way to straighten teeth and touted five -star reviews \u2014 but behind the scenes, the company silenced dissatisfied consumers and buried complaints about injuries caused by its products,\" Schwalb said in a statement. SmileDirectClub, which also agreed to pay $500,000, said in the settlement that it had not violated the law or engaged in unfair or deceptive practices. Susan Greenspon Rammelt, SmileDirectClub's chief legal officer, said in a statement that claims that the company sought to stop negative consumer feedback were a \"misinformation campaign.\" She said that the company did not ask customers to sign a nondisclosure agreement if they asked for a refund within 30 days of receiving their aligners and that the agreements were negotiable. The company said that its release form was modeled on one used by the orthodontics industry and that it already had plans to \"tailor the nondisclosure provision more narrowly.\" SmileDirectClub's services, which are cheaper than traditional orthodontics because they often do not involve in -person visits, have drawn criticism from dentist and orthodontist groups. The company has sued some of those critics and accused California's dental board of conspiring to stifle competition. SmileDirectClub went public in 2019, raising $1.29 billion at a valuation of nearly $9 billion. It has not turned a profit as a public company. Its stock has fallen below $1 a share, valuing it at $166 million. Clinical Practice Guideline Cover Story Evidence-based clinical practice guideline onrestorative treatments for caries lesions A report from the American DDS, J. Sabino, DDS, PhD; Rebecca Slayton, DDS, PhD;Norman Tinanoff, DDS, MS; Douglas A. Young, DDS, EdD, MBA, DDS, MS; Carrasco-Labra, DDS, MSc, PhD ABSTRACT Background. An expert panel convened by the American Dental Association (ADA) Council on Scienti c Affairs together with the ADA Science and Research Institute 's program for Clinical and Translational Research conducted a systematic review and developed recommendations for the treatment of moderate and advanced cavitated caries lesions in patients with vital, non- endodontically treated primary and permanent teeth. Types of Studies Reviewed. The authors searched for systematic reviews comparing carious tissue removal (CTR) approaches in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Trip Medical Database. The authors also conducted a systematic search for ran-domized controlled trials comparing direct restorative materials in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov , and the World Health Orga- nization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The authors used the Grading of Recom- mendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty of the evidence and formulate recommendations. Results. The panel formulated 16 recommendations and good practice statements: 4 on CTR approaches speci c to lesion depth and 12 on direct restorative materials speci ct ot o o t h location and surfaces involved. The panel con ditionally recommended for the use of conser- vative CTR approaches, especially for advanced lesions. Although the panel conditionally recommended for the use of all direct restorative materials, they prioritized some materials over the use of others for certa in clinical scenarios. Practical Implications. The evidence suggests that more conservative CTR approaches may decrease the risk of adverse effects. All included direct restorative materials may be effective intreating moderate and advanced caries lesions on vital, nonendodontically treated primary andpermanent teeth. Key Evidence-based https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adaj.2023.04.011 Restorative dentistry is integral to managing caries.1The decisions involved in restoring teeth are complex and based on the balance of several factors such as prognosis, caries risk and activity assessment, and clinical or radiographic signs of cavitation.2,3When indicated, various carious tissue removal (CTR) approaches (that is, the extent of carious tissue removed) and direct restorative materials are available to restore moderate and advanced ( Table 1 ) caries lesions on vital, nonendodontically treated primary and permanent teeth.Copyright \u00aa2023 American Dental Association. All rights reserved. JADA 154(7) nJuly 2023 551Clinicians select a CTR approach and restorative material on the basis of their clinical experi- ence, in fluenced by factors such as the goal of restoring form, function, and esthetics and reducing the likelihood of outcomes such as pulp exposure, restoration failure, and secondary caries. Commercially available restorative materials in the United States include amalgam, compomer, conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC), preformed crowns, resin composite (RC), and resin- modi ed GIC (RMGIC). Although there is evidence of the success of restorative treatment after different CTR approaches and restorative materials for vital, nonendodontically treated primary and permanent teeth, there isa need for an evidence-based clinical practice guideline (CPG) to assist clinicians in makingrestorative choices with their patients. The American Dental Association (ADA) Council on Scienti c Affairs convened a panel of general, pediatric, and public health dentists specializing in cariology, operative dentistry, and dental materials to develop this guideline on restorative treat- ments for caries lesions. The ADA Science and Research Institute program for Clinical and Translational Research (formerly known as the Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry) provided methodological support, led stakeholder engagement, and drafted the article. The ADA funded thisguideline, but the ADA was not involved in formulating the clinical questions or recommendations. SCOPE, PURPOSE, AND TARGET AUDIENCE This guideline is a part of the ADA 's CPG series on caries management 4and its purpose is helping clinicians choose the most appropriate CT R approaches and direct restorative materials for treating moderate and advanced caries lesions on vital, nonendodontically treated primaryand permanent teeth requiring restorations ( Table 1 ). These recommendations apply when the decision to treat a caries lesion with a direct restoration has been made and do not informwhen to treat a caries lesion using nonrestorative or restorative approaches. Furthermore, the following are not within the scope of this guideline: indirect materials (for example, inlays and onlays), the use of liners or silver diamine fluoride, the means to remove carious tissue (for example, rotary and hand instruments and chemicals), pulp therapy, or choosing between repairing or replacing a restoration. The target audience for this guideline includes dental practitioners and their support teams, dental students, and patients. Policy makers also may bene t from these recommendations. METHODSWe followed the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Reporting Checklist II 5and Guidelines International Network-McMaster Guideline Development Checklist.6 The panel and methodologists met in person in August 2019 to review con flicts of interest of all panel members and determine the guideline 's scope, purpose, target audience, and clinical ques- tions. Meetings occurred virtually to review the evidence from the associated systematic review (SR) led by ADA Science and Research Institute methodologists7(November 2021, January 2022) and to formulate clinical recommendations (June and July 2022). Methodologists (L.P., S.P.)facilitated the formulation of recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assess-ment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Evidence-to-Decision framework. 8-11After reviewing the evidence, the panel members formulated clinical recommendations via discussionuntil they achieved consensus. When agreement was elusive, the panel voted on the decision. Asper GRADE guidance, the strength of recommendations can be strong or conditional, and each has implications for clinicians, patients, and policy makers ( Table 2 ). 12Methodologists conducted stakeholder and public engagement throughout the development of this guideline. Additional details regarding the methodology can be found in the Appendix Methods, available online at the end of the article.7 RESULTS How to use the recommendations The panel developed these recommendations and good practice statements to assist clinicians (in collaboration with their patients) and policy makers in the restorative decision-making process. Clinicians should use clinical judgment to determine when the recommended course of action maynot be appropriate, warranting deviation from these recommendations.ABBREVIATION Hall technique.

Six RCTs 14-19 informed recommendations for CTR approaches to treat moderate caries lesions. Moderate to very low certainty evidence suggests that nonselective and selective CTR may be lesseffective when compared with no CTR across most outcomes ( eTable 3, eTable 4 ,eFigure 3 , eFigure 4, available online at the end of this article). Evidence also suggests that neither nonse-lective nor selective CTR may be more effective than the other (very low certainty; eTable 5, eFigure 5, eFigure 6 , available online at the end of this article). Six RCTs 20-25informed recommendations for CTR approaches to treat advanced caries lesions. Moderate to very low certainty evidence suggests that selective CTR may be more effective when compared with nonselective, stepwise, and no CTR across all ,eFigure 9 ,eFigure 10 , available online at the end of this article). In addition, nonselective CTR may be less effective across all outcomes compared with stepwise (lowcertainty; eTable 9 , available online at the end of this article). We found no SRs meeting our selection criteria that reported undesirable effects. Values and preferences The panel judged that there was possibly important uncertainty or variability in patients 'values and preferences (PVPs) among all CTR approaches. This judgment was based on indirect evi-dence from studies conducted outside of the United States among people with permanent teeth,along with panel discussion regarding the additional appointments required for stepwise and, in some instances, no CTR. Additional details are in the Appendix , available online at the end of this article. Resources required One potential difference in cost is that stepwise and, in some instances, no CTR requires multiple visits, increasing the procedure 's cost and treatment time. Preformed crowns are often placed afterTable 1. Denitions of carious tissue removal approaches and clinical presentation of caries lesion. CARIOUS TISSUE REMOVAL APPROACHES (THAT IS, THE EXTENT OF CARIOUS TISSUE REMOVED) Nonselective Caries Removal Carious tissue is removed until hard dentin is reached. Also known as complete caries removal. Selective Caries Removal Carious tissue is removed until soft or rm dentin is reached. Also known as partial or incomplete caries removal. Stepwise Caries Removal Carious tissue is rst removed until soft dentin is reached and then a temporary restoration is placed. Months later, the restoration and carious tissue are removed until rm dentin is reached and a permanent restoration is then placed. Also known as 2-step caries removal. No Carious Tissue Removal No carious tissue is removed prior to the placement of a de nitive restoration.

Thus, the panel judged nonselective and selective CTR as the least costly, stepwise CTR as having intermediate costs, and no CTR as the most costly. Acceptability Although the panel concluded that key stakeholders probably nd all CTR approaches acceptable, variation in acceptability of nonselective and selective CTR may exist owing to some clinicians having concerns about leaving carious tissues behind and other clinicians being in favor of more conservative and biological removal approaches (that is, selective).26,27In addition, the panel determined that on the basis of reviewed studies, no CTR is generally acceptable in cases in which a preformed metal crown (PMC) is indicated and emphasized that stepwise CTR may not be as acceptable owing to the need for a second appointment required to place a nal restoration. For additional details, see the Appendix , available online at the end of this article. FeasibilityWe found no evidence regarding the feasibility of all CTR approaches. Although the panel noted that all CTR approaches are generally feasible, they judged stepwise as slightly less feasible owing tothe need for a second appointment to remove more demineralized tissue and place the nal restoration. Question 2 In patients with vital permanent teeth requiri ng restorative treatment, without pulp therapy and regardless of direct restorative material and means to remove carious tissue (that is, mechanical or chemomechanical), should we recommend nonselective, stepwise (advancedlesions only), selective, or no CTR to treat moderate and advanced caries lesions ( Table 3 , Figure 2 )?

Desirable and undesirable effects Sixteen RCTs 16,33-47informed the desirable effects, providing data on oral health -related quality of life, patient satisfaction, postoperative pain and discomfort, restoration failure, restoration fracture, restoration loss, secondary caries, unacceptable anatomic form, unacceptable color match, and unacceptable marginal adaptation. We did not nd direct evidence on direct restorative materials for Class III and Class V resto- rations on primary teeth. Therefore, the panel informed these recommendations using indirectevidence from 4 RCTs 33-36on permanent teeth, rating down the CoE 1 level owing to serious issues of indirectness (very low certainty). For Class III restorations on permanent teeth, the evidence suggests that nanocomposite may be less effective for some outcomes and shows little to no dif- ference in others compared with hybrid RC ( eTable 13 , available online at the end of this article). For Class V restorations on permanent teeth, very low certainty evidence suggests that when compared with hybrid RC and conventional GIC, RMGIC may be more effective for some out- comes and less effective for others ( eTable 14 ,eTable 15 , available online at the end of this article). In addition, conventional GIC may be more effective than hybrid RC ( eTable 16 , available online at the end of this article).Selective carious tissue removal, nonselective carious removalModerate removal or stepwise carious not feasibleSelective carious tissue removal or no carious tissue removal Figure 1.

The prioritization of caries removal approaches in this recommendation is a ranking determined by the panel on the basis of their effectiveness, patients 'values and preferences, resources required, acceptability, and feasibility. Stepwise carious tissue removal is de ned as carious tissue being rst removed until soft dentin is reached, followed by placement of a temporary restoration. Months later, the restoration and carious tissue are removed until rm dentin is reached and a permanent restoration is then placed. This is also known as 2-step for Class II restorations. Moderate to very low certainty evidence suggests that when compared with conventional GIC, amalgam, hybrid RC, macro lled RC, nanocomposite, and RMGIC 17 eTable 18 ,eTable 19 ,eTable 20 ,eTable 21 , available online at the end of this article). Neither hybrid RC nor RMGIC may be more effective than the other (very low certainty; eTable 22 , available online at the end of this article). Low certainty evidence suggests that there may be littleto no difference between compomer and conventional GIC ( eTable 23, available online at the end of this article). PMCs placed with the Hall technique (HT) are probably more effective whencompared with conventional GIC placed with atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) (moderatecertainty; eTable 24 , available online at the end of this article). We did not nd direct evidence on amalgam, hybrid RC, nanocomposite, PMCs, and RMGIC to restore Class I restorations on primary teeth. Therefore, the panel informed these recommendationsusing indirect evidence, prioritizing data on Class I and Class II restorations combined (that is, data from primary studies in which authors grouped and analyzed both posterior Class I and Class II restorations together) over Class II restorations alone. The panel acknowledged the risk of expe-riencing restoration failure was higher with involvement of more tooth surfaces and therefore assumed that direct materials proving effective in Class II restorations also may be effective in Class I posterior restorations (that is, a conservative risk of failure). We rated down the CoE 1 and 2 levelsfor Class I and Class II restorations combined and Class II restorations alone, respectively, owing to serious issues of indirectness (very low certainty). Seven RCTs 15,37,39-41 ,45,46informed recommendations for Class I restorations.

In addition, we found no evidence of the effects of any direct restorative material for Class I anterior restorations. One SR 48informed the undesirable effects of amalgam and RCs to restore caries lesions, indi- cating there may be little to no difference in risk of experiencing adverse effects (AEs) (that is,anaphylaxis, neurobehavioral assessment, kidney function, psychosocial function, and physical development) among the materials.

Patients 'values and preferences The panel determined there was important uncertainty or variability in PVPs regarding amalgam but probably no important uncertainty or variability regarding all other materials ( Appendix , available online at the end of this article). Resources required On average, the cost to patients for amalgam restorations is approximately 75% of the price of esthetic restorations for the same number of surfaces (American Dental Association Health Policy Institute, Analysis of the IBM MarketScan Dental Database, unpublished data, 2019). The paneldetermined this difference was signi cant for decision making. For PMCs, the panel judged that the cost of a PMC was not signi cantly higher than that of esthetic for 2-surface restora- tions. For single-surface restorations, however, the panel believed the cost of a PMC was sub-stantially more than that of amalgam and esthetic restorations ( Table 4 ). Acceptability Although amalgam has been recognized for its superiority in durability, 49longevity, and afford- ability,50,51the panel highlighted that all direct restorative materials present acceptable levels of effectiveness. However, potential AEs for patients and the reported environmental harms of mer-cury have raised concerns, questioning the acceptability of amalgam. Although there is insuf cient evidence 48,52,53to support the hypothesis that amalgam increases the risk of AEs compared with any other restorative materials, national54,55and international stakeholders56-58have questioned the use of amalgam in general and in vulnerable populations speci cally.Table 4.

Desirable effectsTwenty-one RCTs 34-36 ,59-76informed the desirable effects, providing data on tooth fracture (crown), patient satisfaction, postoperative pain and discomfort, restoration failure, restorationfracture, restoration loss, secondary caries, time needed to perform the restoration, unacceptablecolor match, and unacceptable marginal adaptation. The panel used the same body of evidence summarized in Question 3 ( eTable 13 ,eTable 14 , eTable 15 ,eTable 16 , available online at the end of this article) to inform recommendations for Class III and Class V restorations. In addition, we did not nd direct evidence regarding the effect of direct materials for Class I anterior restorations on permanent teeth.

Conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC) may be preferable when light curing is not feasible. Conventional andresin-modi ed GIC may be preferable when tooth isolation cannot be achieved, in patients with special healthcare needs, or in patients lacking pre- dictable access to care.

Resin composites refer to hybrid resin composite, macro lled resin composite, and nanocomposite. The guideline panel assigned no ranking among the prioritized interventions. The prioritization of interventions in this recommendation isa ranking determined by the panel on the basis of their effectiveness, patients 'values and preferences, resources required, acceptability, and feasibility.

JADA 154(7) nhttp://jada.ada.org nJuly 2023 561recommendation using indirect evidence from 3 RCTs34-36on Class V restorations on permanent teeth, as summarized in Question 3. We rated down the CoE 1 level owing to serious issues of indirectness (very low). We did not nd direct evidence regarding the effects of amalgam, macro lled RC, and nano- composite to restore Class I restorations alone and Class II restorations alone on permanent teeth.The panel informed these recommendations using indirect evidence from 8 RCTs 59-66on Class I and Class II restorations combined. We rated down the CoE 1 level owing to serious issues of indirectness (very low). Twelve RCTs59-63 ,67-73i n f o r m e dr e c o m m e n d a t i o n sf o rC l a s sIp o sterior restorations. Low certainty evidence suggests that RMGIC may be more effective than conventional GIC, and conventional GICmay be more effective than compomer across all outcomes for Class I posterior restorations ( eTable 29 , eTable 30 , available online at the end of this article). Although conventional GIC may be less effective than hybrid RC (low certainty; eTable 31 , available online at the end of this article), neither nano- composite nor hybrid RC may be more effe ctive than the othe r (low certainty; eTable 32 , available online at the end of this article). Indirect evidenc e from Class I and Class II restorations combined showed that amalgam and macro lled RC may be more effective than hybrid RC across most outcomes (low to very low certainty; eTable 33 ,eTable 34 , available online at the end of this article). Twelve RCTs 59-66 ,68,69,74,75informed recommendations for Class II restorations. Low certainty evidence suggests that both hybrid RC and RMGIC may be more effective than conventional GICacross all outcomes for Class II restorations ( eTable 35 ,eTable 36 , available online at the end of this article). However, hybrid RC placed with rotary instruments may be more effective than con- ventional GIC placed with ART (moderate to very low certainty; eTable 37 , available online at the end of this article). Indirect evidence from Class I and Class II restorations combined showednanocomposite may be more effective than hybrid RC ( eTable 38 , available online at the end of this article). Indirect evidence from Class I and Class II restorations combined for amalgam(eTable 33 , available online at the end of this article) and macro lled RC ( eTable 34 , available online at the end of this article) summarized above also informed this recommendation. One study 76informed recommendations for restorations in root caries lesions. Low certainty evidence suggests that GIC may be more effective than RMGIC ( eTable 39 , available online at the end of this article). The panel used the same evidence on undesirable effects, PVP, resources required, acceptability, and feasibility described for Question 3 to inform recommendations for permanent teeth. The associated SR7includes a narrative summary of outcomes across comparisons for direct restorative materials in primary and permanent teeth that did not allow for the calculating treat-ment effect estimates and 95% CIs. DISCUSSION Summary of main ndings In most clinical scenarios, evidence did not show important differences between CTR approaches and direct restorative materials 7to suggest whether 1 treatment option is superior to another. One keynding for advanced lesions was that more conservative CTR approaches were associated with fewer clinical failures. The panel identi ed important concerns relating to PVPs, acceptability, and feasibility, leading to prioritization of interventions within speci c recommendations. For example, environmental concerns beyond the con nes of dentistry in fluenced the acceptability factor for direct restorative materials.57,58It is important to emphasize that prioritizing an intervention does not equate to a recommendation against another. Very low certainty evidence resulted in condi- tional recommendations only. Clinicians should implement shared decision making with patients orcaretakers when implementing these recommendations. Implications for practice Two important recommendations of this guideline highlight the prioritization of more conservative CTR to treat advanced caries lesions on primary and permanent teeth over nonconservative CTR.A paradigm shift in the last 20 years to preserve healthy tooth structure has changed how clinicians should treat advanced lesions. Although the panel acknowledges decisions regarding CTR ap- proaches may be based on early clinical education, 77learned behaviors, and preferences, they 562 JADA 154(7) nhttp://jada.ada.org nJuly 2023suggest placing a greater emphasis on the evidence of increased risk of experiencing outcomes such as pulp exposure when all carious tissues are removed. The panel urges clinicians to use more conservative CTR approaches that align with restorative dentistry 's 2 main aims: preserving healthy tooth structure27and protecting the pulp-dentin complex.2 Comparison with other guidelinesTo our knowledge, this is the rst CPG on CTR approaches and direct restorative materials for primary and permanent teeth informed by an SR and using the GRADE framework to assess theCoE and develop clinical recommendations. This guideline is consistent with earlier guidance andconsensus documents developed by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry 3and the In- ternational Caries Consensus Collaboration2suggesting more conservative approaches to treat moderate and advanced lesions. Regarding recommendations for direct restorative materials, theAmerican Academy of Pediatric Dentistry also provides similar guidance to restore primary and permanent teeth in children and adolescents. Although the International Caries Consensus Collaboration did not provide recommendations for speci c materials, they acknowledged that factors such as tooth location, lesion depth, and caries risk are necessary to inform the appropriate choice of direct restorative material. Guidance from other associations has not been formally assessed or endorsed by the ADA. Implications for research The lack of evidence on CTR approaches to treat moderate lesions on permanent teeth resulted in the panel using indirect evidence from advanced lesions to inform these recommendations. Given that moderate lesions may have a lower risk of experiencing pulpal complications regardless of CTRapproaches, it is dif cult to make assumptions about the true effect of CTR approaches using data from advanced lesions. Trials comparing CTR approaches in moderate lesions in permanent teethwould help address this research gap. In addition, the results regarding HT in primary teeth werechallenging to consider in the context of this guideline (that is, comparing the success of the HT with conventionally placed direct restorations likely is in fluenced by the high success rate of PMCs and not CTR approaches). Future RCTs comparing the effectiveness of PMCs placed with the HT to preformed crowns placed conventionally is needed to evaluate the effect of CTR approaches and inform decision making. The panel urges researchers in the eld of direct restorative materials to include the evaluation of AE outcomes in their clinical studies. None of the studies in the associated SR 7reported on AEs. There was also a lack of studies identi ed on preformed crowns for anterior and posterior primary teeth, which resulted in the use of limited indirect evidence to inform recommendations, warranting the conduct of new studies on this intervention. The low event rate for outcomes related to clinical failure contributed to the panel 's inability to detect important differences among direct restorative materials, if a difference exists. Follow-ups over 36 months will allow more time for material longevity assessment and long-term outcomes such as secondary caries to be meaningfully evaluated. Another complication is the continual advancements in restorative materials, as materials used in trials may be obsolete when results are published. Overall, a more detailed reporting of lesion andtreatment characteristics and reasons for restoration failure may enhance applicability for decision making. CONCLUSIONS To restore moderate and advanced caries lesions on vital, nonendodontically treated primary and permanent teeth, the panel suggests the use of more conservative, single-visit CTR approaches and various direct restorative materials. The panel acknowledges the importance of considering addi-tional factors, such as patient and caregiver preferences and treatment costs, when developing a treatment plan. n SUPPLEMENTAL DATA Supplemental data related to this article can be found clinical professor and the chair, Department of Orthodontics and Pediatric Dentistry, University of Maryland School of Dentistry, Baltimore, MD.

Exploring how U.S.dental schools teach removal of carious tissues during cavity preparations. guration and con flicts of interest In 2019, the American Dental Association (ADA) Council on Scienti c Affairs convened and approved a multidisciplinary panel comprising general, pediatric, and public health dentists. Panel members completed intellectual and nancial con flicts of interest disclosure forms reviewed by methodologists and the legal department at the ADA. All intellectual and nancial con flicts of interest were disclosed at the beginning of the rst panel meeting to de ne the scope, purpose, target audience, and clinical questions and at the last panel meeting to formulate recommendations. If panel members had con flicts of interest related to speci c recommendations, methodologists asked them to refrain from discussing and formulating them. Retrieving the evidence The results of 2 systematic reviews (SRs) informed these clinical recommendations: 1 developed bythe Cochrane Oral Health Group to inform recommendations regarding carious tissue removal (CTR) approaches (that is, the extent of carious tissue removed) e1and another led by method- ologists at the ADA Science and Research Institute (ADASRI) program for Clinical and Trans- lational Research to inform recommendations regarding direct restorative materials.e2 Methodologists led an SR to inform recommendations regarding CTR approaches to treat moderate and advanced caries lesions on primary and permanent teeth. We included SRs oroverviews of SRs of randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including patients of any age with at least 1 caries lesion requiring a restoration on primary or permanent teeth published from 2017 through 2022. We included reviews that conducted searches in at least 2 electronic,bibliographic databases with the reporting of at least 1 search strategy and methods that are reproducible; included at least 2 interventions included in the clinical questions formulated by the panel; reported on prede ned outcomes included as part of the clinical questions formulated by the panel; and provided details on study selection and data extraction. We excluded reviews that did not use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (or another validated tool) to assess the certainty of the evidence, did not report theextent of carious tissue removed, have been superseded by a subsequent update of the same SR or meta-analysis, only assessed the effectiveness of head-to-head comparisons of different means to remove caries (that is, mechanical or chemomechanical), and included primary studies in which arestoration was placed in an endodontically treated tooth. This search strategy for desirable effects contained concepts for caries and caries removal. In collaboration with methodologists and the panel, an informationist (K.K.O.) built the search strategyin Ovid MEDLINE using a combination of subject headings and key words. All searches werecompleted in March 2022 in Ovid MEDLINE from 1946 through March 2022, Embase from 1947 through March 2022, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Trip Medical Database. The SIGN systematic reviews lter was modi ed to include guideline language and applied to the MED- LINE and Embase searches. e3Database-supplied limits were used to limit to All Secondary Evidence in Trip and items published in the past 5 years in all databases. No language limits were applied. Completesearch strategies for all 4 databases are provided below. MEDLINE. Database: Ovid MEDLINE.

Two reviewers (L.P., S.P.) independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of eligible references, and another reviewer (O.U.) served as an arbiter when consensus was elusive. We prioritized the selection of 1 SR to inform clinical recommendations using this criteria: SRs assessing all interventions of interest using network meta-analysis, if possible; including data on both primary and permanent dentition; using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence; reporting dataspeci c to lesion depth; only including RCTs rather than both RCTs and other study designs; and SRs \"[superseding a] subsequent SR or meta-analysis. \" e4Once 1 SR was identi ed, the same re- viewers assessed the excluded studies table to con rm references were not excluded that would t within the scope of our guideline. One methodologist (O.U.) critically appraised all SRs used to inform the development of this guideline using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematicReviews led the development of an SR to inform recommendations regarding direct restorative materials to restore caries lesions on vital, nonendodontically treated primary and permanent teeth. Detailed information speci c to the methodology used to conduct this review is published elsewhere.e2In brief, a search strategy containing caries and restorative materials concepts was developed and run in collaboration with an informationist (K.K.O.). Eligibility criteria includedRCTs or quasi-RCTs, including children or adults requiring de novo or replacement restorations onvital teeth; head-to-head comparisons of the interventions of interest; and reporting on the pre- dened outcomes of interest. Pairs of reviewers (L.P., S.P., A.C.-L., and 3 authors of the related SR e2) independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts of eligible references. When dis- agreements occurred, a third reviewer (L.P., S.P.) determined the nal eligibility. Four reviewers (L.P., S.P., and 2 authors of the associated SR) independently and in duplicate extracted data from primary studies. We resolved all con flicts via group discussion. In the absence of data on the undesirable effects of CTR approaches and direct restorative materials, 1 methodologist (O.U.) conducted a supplemental search for SRs and health technologyassessments (HTAs) in MEDLINE via PubMed and the TRIP database using key words related tothe population and interventions of interest. Another reviewer (L.P.) conducted quality control and independently audited the eligibility of each reference. We applied the same selection criteria described above. However, we relaxed the study design criteria to include SRs or HTAs summa-rizing observational studies in the absence of references summarizing data from RCTs. Evidence synthesis and measures of association We used a xed-effects and a random-effects model to pool data for the direct restorative materials and CTR approaches SRs, respectively. We calculated risk differences and 95% CIs for dichoto-mous outcomes and mean differences and 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Certainty of the evidence We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. e6The certainty of the evidence indicates the panel 's con dence in the treatment effects used to support the recommendations. Moving from evidence to decisions The panel de ned and ranked outcomes a priori. Outcomes could either be critical, important, or not important for decision making. For CTR approaches for primary teeth, the panel ranked pulp vitality, pulpal exposure, pulpal complications due to infection, the need to treat endodontically, caries progression, tooth loss, tooth extraction, postoperative pain and discomfort, and secondary caries as critical outcomes andadverse effects (AEs) (that is, anaphylaxis, neurobehavioral assessment, kidney function, psycho- social function, and physical development), tooth fracture, cost and cost-effectiveness, patients discomfort during treatment, restoration failure, injury to adjacent tissue or tooth, time needed toperform restoration, and patient satisfaction as important outcomes. For CTR approaches for permanent teeth, the panel ranked tooth loss, pulp vitality, pulpal exposure, pulpal complications due to infection, the need to treat endodontically, tooth extraction,caries progression, postoperative pain and discomfort, secondary caries, longevity of restoration, and tooth fracture as critical and restoration failure, cost and cost-effectiveness, injury to adjacent tissue or tooth, patient discomfort during treatment, AEs, patient satisfaction, and time needed to performrestoration as important. For direct restorative materials for primary teeth, the panel ranked pulpal complications due to infection, pulp vitality, caries progression, pulpal exposure, oral health -related quality of life, AEs, the need to treat endodontically, tooth loss, secondary caries, postoperative pain and discomfort,restoration fracture, tooth fracture, longevity of the restoration, and restoration failure as critical outcomes and unacceptable marginal adaptation, restoration loss, time needed to perform the restoration, patient satisfaction, patient discomfort during treatment, marginal discoloration orstaining, unacceptable anatomic form, and unacceptable color match as important outcomes.

Methodologists (L.P., S.P.) facilitated recommendation formulation using the GRADE Evi- dence-to-Decision (EtD) framework.e7This framework includes 9 factors for panels to move from evidence to clinical recommendations: problem prioritization, magnitude of desirable effects,magnitude of undesirable effects, certainty of the evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable effects, patients 'values and preferences, resources required, acceptability, and feasibility. We con- ducted nonsystematic searches to nd evidence of patients 'values and preferences, acceptability, and feasibility. If multiple study types were available on the same topic, we prioritized the use of SRsand RCTs over nonrandomized and observational studies when applicable. Methodologists adapted GRADE 's EtD approach to choose from multiple interventions e8to compare and judge interventions across all EtD criteria and mirrored this approach after 2 clinical practice guidelines: 1 developed by the American Society of Hematologye9and another developed by ADASRI, University of Pittsburgh, and University of Pennsylvania (A. Carrasco-Labra, writtencommunication, August 2021). We used a star-based system ranging from 1 through 3 stars to rankall interventions considered in the factor. In this system, 1 star is the lowest score and considered the least, or one of the least, effective interventions, and 3 stars is the highest score and considered the most, or one of the most, effective interventions. Overall, the more stars an intervention receives, the more favorable it is judged across each criterion. These judgments are relative terms used when comparing the interventions against oneanother and do not imply that a material 's overall effectiveness is of superior, intermediate, or inferior value. Once the panel discussed the evidence and made judgments for each factor, the panel determined the direction and strength of each recommendation. Stakeholder and public engagement We conducted stakeholder engagement twice during the guideline development process. We rst requested internal and external stakeholders to provide feedback on the scope, purpose, clinical questions, and target audience and then on the clinical recommendations. We also invited the general public to review and provide feedback on the recommendations on the ADASRI program for Clinical and Translational Research website. e10We reviewed and considered all relevant feedback in the nal draft of the recommendation statements and remarks. Updating processADASRI program for Clinical and Translational Research will update the guideline recommen- dations every 5 years or when new evidence is available and could change the direction and strength of recommendations. RESULTS Characteristics of included studies and methodological quality assessment We identi ed 372 citations from the literature search to inform recommendations for CTR ap- proaches. After removing 84 duplicates, we screened 288 titles and abstracts and 32 full-texts ofSRs. Four e1,e11-e13SRs met our selection criteria, and, ultimately, 1e1was included, which assessed the effectiveness of interventions to treat caries lesions on vital, nonendodontically treated primary and permanent teeth ( eFigure 1 ,eTable 1, eTable 2). Although the authors included nonrestorative and restorative strategies in this SR, only studies related to nonselective, stepwise, selective, and noCTR (that is, sealing a caries lesion with a preformed metal crown [PMC]) were of interest. We identi ed 3 SRs e14-e16and 1 HTAe17to inform the undesirable effects of direct restorative materials. There was overlap in the primary studies included in these reviews reporting on the outcomes of interest to the panel. Therefore, we prioritized using data from an SR by Worthington and colleagues,e14as the study authors used the GRADE approach, allowing for continuity in the way the certainty of the evidence was assessed across our evidence base. 566.e6 JADA 154(7) nhttp://jada.ada.org nJuly quality ( eFigure 17 ). In addition, because both included SRse1,e14were published in 2021, methodologists decided not to update them. However, 2 reviewers (L.P., S.P.) reextracted data from the included primary studies of the SR by Schwendicke and colleaguese1to guarantee that the panel was presented with all critical and important outcomes for decision making. Desirable and undesirable effects related to CTR approaches for moderate and advanced caries lesions on primary teeth For the comparison of nonselective vs selective CTR to treat moderate caries lesions on primaryteeth, e18there were 0 events in both arms of the study for the outcomes of loss of restoration at 12- month follow-up (very low certainty). For the comparison of nonselective vs selective CTR to treat advanced caries lesions on primary teeth,e19,e20there were 0 events in both arms of the studies for the outcomes of restoration loss, postoperative pain and discomfort, and pulpal complications due to infection at 6-month follow-up (very low certainty). Values and preferences related to CTR approaches for moderate and advanced caries lesions on primary and permanent teeth We found no studies conducted in the United States reporting on the relative importance of variousclinical outcomes that patients place when undergoing CTR (for example, pulp exposure, need for endodontic treatment, secondary caries, restorative complications) in primary or permanent teeth. We identi ed 1 mixed-methods study conducted in Germany, e21which gathered data on patient preferences toward selective and nonselective CTR. Results from 150 patients aged 18 through 85 years showed that most participants (82.7%) preferred nonselective over selective CTR. When factoring in other variables, participants who were more emotionally stable and had university degrees were more likely to prefer selective CTR than participants who were less emotionally stableand without a university degree. In addition, a risk acceptance assessment showed that patients were more likely to accept a higher cost, the need for root canal treatment, and impaired esthetics than the outcomes of nerve damage, restoration failure, and secondary caries. The panel considered thereis possible important uncertainty or variability in patients 'values and preferences (PVP) for se- lective and nonselective CTR. Regarding stepwise and no CTR, the panel discussed that patients orcaregivers may prefer not to return for a second appointment that is necessary for stepwise CTR and sometimes no CTR. On the basis of this information, the panel determined that there was possibly important uncertainty or variability in PVPs for all CTR approaches. Acceptability related to CTR approaches for moderate and advanced caries lesions on primary and permanent teeth From the clinician 's perspective, research evidence suggests varying degrees of acceptability of nonselective, stepwise, selective, and no CTR. Two studies e22,e23surveyed clinicians to determine their beliefs, attitudes, and practices when treating advanced caries lesions restoratively. Most re-spondents stated that they would remove all carious tissue regardless of the risk of pulp exposure andthat no carious tissue should be left behind to ensure the success of a restoration. Because nonse- lective CTR has been the reference standard over the past decades, e24Oen and colleaguese22 highlighted that clinicians may emphasize their colleagues 'approval and perspectives over the evidence showing the increased effectiveness of conservative CTR approaches when determiningtreatment. In addition, Nascimento and colleagues e25evaluated the teaching practices of CTR approaches among cariology department faculty members from 43 dental schools in the United States. Studyauthors found slight variability in how dental schools de ned principles related to caries removal and how lesion depth affects treatment planning. Most respondents (26 of 40 dental schools) agreed that infected dentin should always be removed to prevent the progression of caries under the restoration and disagreed that affected dentin should always be removed to avoid the progression of caries under the restoration (35 of 40 dental schools). Twenty-seven respondents agreed and 8disagreed that caries removal should be minimally invasive regardless of lesion depth and only infected dentin should be removed. JADA 154(7) nhttp://jada.ada.org nJuly 2023 566.e7Lastly, an RCT conducted in Germany assessed children 's pain perception and acceptability among parents and dentists of conventional restorative treatment, Hall technique (HT), and nonrestorative caries treatment.e26Results suggested that more than one-half of the parents were very satis ed with their child 's treatment, and almost all parents stated that they would choose the same treatment option again. In addition, clinicians noted that most HT and conventionalrestorative treatments were easy to perform or handle and took long to complete. However, therewere differences between the provided and preferred treatment for each caries lesion. Seventy-two percent of clinicians would have performed conventional restorative treatment, whereas only 30.7% of treatments provided during the study were conventional restorative treatment. Furthermore, 17%preferred conventional restorative treatment with a PMC, and HT would not have been used as an option for treatment. However, it is important to note that \"the HT was introduced to the clinic and taught to the clinicians as part of this trial, so they were unfamiliar with it. following this trial, the HT [is now] routinely performed .indicating an increased level of acceptance and use of [this technique]. \" e26 The panel discussed that although some key stakeholders may place more preference on 1 CTR approach over another, overall, key stakeholders may nd all CTR approaches acceptable. Desirable and undesirable effects related to direct restorative materials for moderate and advanced caries lesions on primary and permanent teeth Of the 8 RCTs included in the review by Worthington and colleagues, 3e27-e29reported data on undesirable effects. Bernado and colleaguese27and Soncini and colleaguese29reported on outcomes related to toxicity (that is, immune, neuorologic, neuoropsychological, psychological, and renalfunction and physical development), whereas Kemaloglu and colleagues e28reported on post- operative sensitivity. No studies reported data on allergic reactions or injuries. Worthington andcolleagues e14concluded that although there may be some differences in harm outcomes between those that received amalgam and resin composite restorations, the differences are not clinically signicant (low to very low certainty). Values and preferences related to direct restorative materials for moderate and advanced caries lesions on primary and permanent teeth We found no studies conducted in the United States reporting on the relative importance of variousclinical outcomes that patients place when receiving a dental restoration for a caries lesion. The panel judged this factor using indirect evidence from studies conducted in people with permanent dentition outside the United States. Although we did not identify any studies examining PVP related to different esthetic restorative materials, the panel agreed that from the patient perspective, esthetic restorations often are regardedequally, with no preference for one over the other. On the basis of this information, the paneldetermined that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in PVP for compomers, conventional glass ionomer cement, resin composites, and resin-modi ed glass ionomer cement for both primary and permanent dentition. With respect to amalgam vs esthetic restorations, a study from Norway and Sweden suggests that patients place a higher value on the restoration 's esthetics and avoid potential adverse reactions than they do on the expected longevity of the restoration. e30In addition, an HTA from Canadae17 found a high degree of variation among qualitative data on experiences associated with amalgam restorations. The included studies in this report shared experiences from patients who had amalgam restorations removed after unexplained symptoms may have been associated with mercury poisoning. The experiences after removal were highly variable. The report authors note that therewas a focus on potential negative outcomes associated with amalgam and a narrow set of per- spectives was represented. On the basis of this information, the panel determined that there was important uncertainty or variability in PVP regarding the use of amalgam for both primary andpermanent dentition. For PMCs, the guideline panel considered a 2020 literature review e31on the HT and found that 77% of patients from a split-mouth triale32preferred the HT over conventional restorative treat- ment and that using separators did not in fluence this preference. The same review also found that the most common reason for a parent to prefer a conventional restoration over a preformed metal 566.e8 JADA 154(7) nhttp://jada.ada.org nJuly 2023crown was esthetics. Still, most parents agreed with treating with a crown after the dentist explained the advantages. On the basis of this information, the panel determined that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in PVP for PMCs in primary teeth. e1. Schwendicke F, Walsh T, Lamont T, et al.

It was my honor to present a certificate recognizing Dr. Jose Javier for his service as OBD President from 4/2022 - 4/2023. The Board elected our public members to be the officers from April 2023 until April 2024. Chip Dunn will serve as OBD President and Jennifer Brixey will serve as OBD Vice President. The 2023 Legislative session concluded with new pieces of legislation that affect our Licensees and all state agencies. New laws and OBD Committee work have funneled a variety of rules to our Board and to public rulemaking hearings. Please see the article later in this newsletter for more information on 17 rule changes, which were effective July 1, 2023. Once again, the only piece of legislation that came from the OBD was our budget bill, HB 5011. The OBD budget included provisions to help fund the Oregon Wellness Program and there is an article in this newsletter to summarize this program which is available to all OBD Licensees. The Legislature approved some fee increases as well. The fee increases are for initial applications and the license renewal fee went up modestly for dentists - an increase of $50 and for dental hygienists and dental therapists - an increase of $25. The OBD last implemented fee increases in 2015. I suggest you take a few minutes and read the articles in this newsletter to review the recent rule changes and other important issues the OBD Staff felt was important for our Licensees to be aware of and stay up to date on as well. If you have any questions or comments, I look forward to hearing from you. Stephen.Prisby@obd.oregon.gov or 971-673-3200 Board Openings in Spring of 2024 The Oregon Board of Dentistry consists of ten board mem- bers. Six must be Oregon licensed dentists, one of which must be a dental specialist, two dental hygienists, and two public members. In the spring of 2024, three board member positions will be available when the second/final terms of service conclude for Dr. Jose Javier, Alicia Riedman, RDH and Jennifer Brixey. A Board term of service is four years, with board members eligible to serve two terms. The Governor appoints the board member and the Senate confirms them. The Governor's office will review and consider the applicant's geographic location, ethnic background, diversity, disciplinary history (if any) and other factors important to the Governor. An Oregon licensed dentist, who resides in Oregon, may apply for a dentist posi-tion on the Board. An Oregon licensed dental hygienist, who resides in Oregon, may apply for a dental hygienist position on the Board. The public member also of course must be an Oregon resident. The professional associations usually review the Board openings and submit names for consideration to serve on the Board. However, anyone who is interested and qualified may submit their name for consideration to serve on the Board. Someone does not need an association's support or endorse-ment to be a board member. The Oregon Board of Dentistry has been very fortunate that there has been good interest in serving on the Board. The Board rarely has vacancies left un-filled due to lack of candidates. There is more information about service on the Board in this Newsletter. On the OBD website at the bottom of the OBD home page under Board/Staff Openings, there is a document providing an overview of desired requirements of a board member, responsibilities and other important information with links to the Governor's page for board service as well.

It is estimated that Board Members typically attend 6 board meetings and 2 - 4 committee meetings per year which roughly translates to about 120 - 140 hours of work per year. The Board also undergoes strategic planning every three to four years and updates rules in the Dental Practice Act almost annually. The OBD strives to meet in person and utilizes remote meet- ings in response to pandemics, weather issues or for emergency meetings to consult on unsafe licensees that need the Board's immediate attention. For more information you can review Oregon Revised Statutes - ORS 679.230 & 679.250 and the OBD website to look at past history of meetings and minutes, newsletters along with other Board documents.

The inaugural advisory committee meeting would most likely be scheduled for fall of 2023, in conjunction with the Oct 27th Board Meeting. The Board of Dentistry and other state agencies operate under a sys - tem of administrative rules to ensure fairness and consistency in procedures and decisions. Periodically, these Ore-gon Administrative Rules (OAR) must be amended in response to evolving standards, new statutes and other circumstances. OAR are written and amended within the agency's statuto - ry authority granted by the Legislature. Rules go through various stages of review before being permanently adopted. The Board strives to publicly share proposed changes through Board meet-ings and Committee meetings along with updates to all licensees and interested parties through email as well. All members of our dental profession, and members of the public, are welcome to attend Board and Committee Meetings which are open to the public. Y our feedback and participation strengthen our community and can bring new ideas to the table. The Board has standing Committees and may create new ones. These Committees are comprised of representatives from all three professional associations representing dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants. The Committees also include representa - tives from the dental therapy community as well - either licensees or educators. Committees discuss and review potential changes to the OAR. The full Board considers the Committees' recommendations and can move them to a public rulemaking hearing for public testi - mony or back to a Committee to be refined and discussed further. Official notice of public rulemaking has been discussed at various board and committee meetings. We also provide information to all of our licensees by posting information on the OBD's web - site, sharing through email blasts and publishing in the Secre - tary of State's Bulletin. The Board held a public rulemaking hearing on May 10, re- garding these 17 rule changes. The Board amended 13 rules, repealed 3 rules and created 1 new rule. They became effective July 1, 2023.

The fee increases are needed to cover the ongoing costs and expenses of the OBD. The last fee increase was in 2015. The OBD is funded primarily (96%) by its Licensees, so the fee increase is needed and justified to cover the OBD's related expenses in its operation. 818-001-0087Fees (1) The Board adopts the following fees:(a) Biennial License Fees:(A) Dental \u2014$440(B) Dental \u2014 retired \u2014 $0(C) Dental Faculty \u2014 $385(D) Volunteer Dentist \u2014 $0(E) Dental Hygiene \u2014$255(F) Dental Hygiene \u2014 retired \u2014 $0(G) Volunteer Dental Hygienist \u2014 $0(H) Dental Therapy - $255(I) Dental Therapy - retired - $0(b) Biennial Permits, Endorsements or Certificates:(A) Nitrous Oxide Permit \u2014 $40(B) Minimal Sedation Permit \u2014 $75(C) Moderate Sedation Permit \u2014 $75(D) Deep Permit General Anesthesia Permit \u2014 $140(F) Radiology \u2014 $75(G) Expanded Function Dental Assistant \u2014 $50(H) Expanded Function Orthodontic Assistant \u2014 $50(I) Instructor Permits \u2014 $40(J) Dental Hygiene Restorative Functions Endorsement \u2014 $50(K) Restorative Functions Dental Assistant \u2014 $50(L) Anesthesia Dental Assistant \u2014 $50(M) Dental Hygiene, Expanded Practice Permit \u2014 $75(N) Non-Resident Dental Background Check - $100.00OREGON BOARD OF DENTISTRY August 2023 www.oregon.gov/dentistry 7Sedation course warningSedation course warning Samantha PlumleeSamantha Plumlee , Examination & Licensing Manager, Examination & Licensing Manager As the licensing manager for the Board, I am frequently asked by dentists, \"will the Board accept a minimal sedation course that is completed entirely online?\" . The an-swer is, and always has been, NO. The Oregon Dental Practice Act, OAR 818-026-0050(1)(c) states that applicants for minimal sedation per - mits must complete \"a comprehensive training program con - sisting of at least 16 hours of training [which] satisfies the re - quirements of the current ADA Guidelines for Teaching Pain Control and Sedation to Dentists and Dental Students at the time training was commenced or postgraduate instruction was completed\" . The relevant section of the current ADA Guidelines for Teach - ing Pain Control and Sedation reads: \"Competency courses in inhalation sedation techniques must afford participants with sufficient clinical experience to enable them to achieve compe - tency. This experience must be provided under the supervision of qualified faculty and must be evaluated. The course director must certify the competency of participants upon satisfactory completion of training. Records of the didactic instruction and clinical experience, including the number of patients treated by each participant must be maintained and available\" . Addition - ally, the ADA Guidelines state \"Competency courses must be presented where adequate facilities are available for proper pa - tient care, including drugs and equipment for the management of emergencies\" . Online courses that do not include hands-on clinical experience demonstrated by the course attendee and supervised/evaluat - ed by qualified faculty, do not meet the requirements outlined in the ADA Guidelines above, and are therefore not acceptable when applying for a minimal sedation permit. In recent years, we have seen an uptick in CE providers offering courses in minimal sedation that make statements such as, this course \"can be completed from the safety and comfort of your own home\" , or \"by taking this series, one does not have to take off work and travel\" . These statements sound too good to be true because they are. CE providers may tell unsuspecting dentists that their course does meet current ADA guidelines, because the course includes a live-stream or video of oral sedation pro - cedures being performed on a patient by a faculty member. The Oregon Board of Dentistry does not consider these types of \"clinical\" course elements to be in adherence with the current ADA Guidelines. While these types of courses may be allowable in some states, this is not the case for Oregon. Before investing your hard-earned money in a sedation CE course, please be vigilant and review the rules set forth by the Oregon Dental Practice Act to ensure that your selected course will meet Oregon's requirements. If you ever have questions about whether a course will meet our requirements, I urge you to contact our office and ask questions prior to registering for a sedation course.

The Oregon Board of Dentistry (OBD) recom - mends that proof of meeting the training requirements be main-tained indefinitely, as copies may be requested at random audits or complaint investigations. Graduates of specialty training programs in Oral and Maxillofa - cial Surgery, Periodontics, and Prosthodontics that comply with CODA standard 4 curriculum guidelines (or similar educational requirements) who have been trained to competency in surgical implant placement may qualify to surgically place implants with documentation of completing the required training.Only hours completed as part of CODA accredited graduate dental programs, or through education providers that are AGD PACE or ADA CERP approved will qualify to meet the initial 56-hour training requirement. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2024, Oregon dentists will be required to complete seven hours of continuing education relat - ed to the placement and/or restoration of dental implants each licensure renewal period. Dentists renewing in Spring 2024, and all subsequent renewing dentists, will be required to complete the required 7 hours of dental implant CE to be in compliance, if they are placing dental implants.

(8) A dentist placing endosseous implants must complete at least seven (7) hours of continuing education related to the placement of dental implants every licensure renewal period (Effective Jan - uary 1, 2024.) How and why did the OBD decide to implement these rule changes regarding dental implants? The OBD investigated 82 dental implants cases between Febru - ary 2014 and August 2017. Of those cases, 41% resulted in Disci-plinary Action, which was equally distributed between specialists and general practitioners. During Strategic Planning in 2016, the OBD identified dental implant complications and the subsequent complaints as a significant problem in Oregon. Dental implant safety was codified in the OBD's 2017-2020 Strategic Plan as a pri - ority issue, and it has remained an ongoing safety concern of the Board through the present. At the April 21, 2017 Board Meeting, in order to effectively protect the public, and per ORS 679.280, the OBD established an ad hoc Committee named the \"Dental Im-plant Safety Workgroup\" to research, review, and discuss dental implants, implant complications, and the resulting investigations. The Workgroup's ultimate goal was to advise the OBD on the most effective actions to protect the public and educate dentists regarding dental implants. The Workgroup included OBD Board Members, OBD Staff and Licensees (both specialists and general practitioners). OREGON BOARD OF DENTISTRY August 2023 www.oregon.gov/dentistry 9If you would like more detail on the communications and time - line for the dental implant rule changes, you can find that doc - ument on the home page of the OBD website: https://www.ore - gon.gov/dentistry I am concerned that I will not be able to obtain proof of completion of my 56 hours of hands on clinical implant train - ing, because some or all of those hours were completed long ago. Many records retention policies limit to seven years or less. Will I just be \"out of luck\" if I can't pull together proof of certain courses? This information will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, typi - cally as part of a CE audit or an investigation. It is expected that the Licensee would put in their best effort to obtain this infor - mation in the event that the training was completed many years ago. The Board will review all relevant information and circum-stances before taking any action. I have placed a great number of implants over the years with a high success rate. Can I be \"grandfathered\" into placing implants without taking 56 hours of hands on clinical courses? There is not currently a portion of the rules that allows this. In order to place implants after January 1, 2024, you will need to meet the 56 hour requirement in OAR 818-012-0005(4). Does the course need to include practice on human patients? Or can it be on a manikin/typodont or an animal jaw? The Board does not specify whether or not the implants need to be placed in a human. As long as the course meets the require - ments of OAR 818-012-0005(4) it is acceptable. Do the 56 hours of hands on clinical course(s) need to be direct patient care? Or can didactic course instruction be included in the 56 hours? The Board defers to the course instructor to define \"clinical hands on, \" and determine how many hours of the course are dedicated to topics and format as stated in the rule. This could include some didactic instruction, provided it is under direct su-pervision as stated in the rule.Dental practices with licensed dental therapists on their care team can now bill OHP for the services they provide. To do this: The licensed dental therapist must enroll with OHA. To find the forms to complete and submit to OHA, visit the OHP Provid- er Enrollment page (search for \"non-payable provider\" forms). When billing for services provided by the dental therapist, the clinic must enter the therapist as the rendering provider. To learn more about billing: For services to coordinated care organization (CCO) mem - bers, please contact the member's CCO. For services to other OHP members, visit the OHP Billing page. To provide care, dental therapists must: Perform under the supervision of a dentist and Have a collaborative agreement with the supervising dentist on file with the Oregon Board of Dentistry. The agreement out- lines the level of supervision and the dentist's requirements for how the dental therapist will provide care.

Board investigations take up your valuable time and may have been avoided with clear communication and good patient relations. There are recurring themes in the complaints the Board receives. Following are a few tips that are worth reviewing regularly and should assist you in preventing complaints being filed by frustrated patients. Train front-office personnel in providing information to your patients and potential patients in a friendly and courteous manner. Be sure they understand the importance of confidentiality. Also, any discussions about fees should include caveats about any additional services that may need to be performed. For instance, if a potential patient calls wanting to know the cost of an extraction, the caller should also be advised that there may be other services and fees required such as for examination and x-rays. Provide patients with a written copy of your office procedures including fees, payment expectations, insurance filings, management of pediatric patients, cancellations and patient responsibilities. Be specific with patients regarding the treatment plan and procedures that you will be following and the meaning of various terms. Document in the patient record that you have discussed the treatment plan, various options and risks with the patient and have answered the patient's questions. With some procedures, a signed consent form is appropriate prior to starting treatment. Do not perform any procedure without the patient's informed consent. Pre-authorize treatment to be done with the patient's insurance company prior to performing the procedure and share the outcome of the prior authorization with the patient before beginning treatment. Document all procedures performed, anesthesia administered, x-rays taken, treatment complications, etc. in the patient record. If it isn't documented - it can be argued that it didn't happen! Documentation is your best defense. No one has ever been disciplined by the Board for over documenting. If in doubt about your diagnosis or treatment plan, consult with a colleague or a specialist. If a patient is dissatisfied with the treatment received, or the outcome, discuss their concerns with them personally and immediately. Do not be defensive, listen to the patient's concerns and work with them for a mutually acceptable outcome. Delegate to dental hygienists, dental therapists and dental assistants only those functions that they are legally permitted to perform. Make sure that everyone in your practice/location that is required to have a license, permit or certificate has posted the license, permit or certificate where patients can see it and that the license, permit or certificate is current. If a license has expired, not only can the holder of the license be disciplined, the doctor can also be disciplined for allowing an unlicensed person to practice. If you have any questions, please call the OBD at 971 673-3200 or email information@obd.oregon.gov Did Y ou Know? The Oregon Board of Dentistry (OBD) has implemented a new licensing system, and the process for requesting addi - tional licenses or updating your contact info has changed. To update your contact info or print a copy of your license, please log in or register for our Licensee portal at https://online.oregondentistry.org/#/OREGON BOARD OF DENTISTRY August 2023 www.oregon.gov/dentistry 11For decades dentists have been successfully treating Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and other sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD). Oral appliance therapy (OAT) is usually very well tolerated and has been proven to have increased compliance as opposed to CPAP type therapies. There still is no easy way to predict which patient will have a better outcome with OAT. Therefore, it is very important to disclose this information to the patient in advance of starting this therapy. Although snoring is nothing more than the vibration of tissues in the oropharynx, it can be a source of embarrassment and relationship difficulties. A dentist should never treat snoring without a diagnosis of \"Primary Snoring\" from a physician to rule out OSA. We cannot make assumptions and treat a patient inappropriately. Organizations providing training and \"standards of care\" for the treatment of SRBD's work collaboratively with their physician counterparts. They agree in the co-management of patients with the physician being the diagnosing party and providing a prescription for OAT. They also agree the appliance must be properly titrated until maximum medical improvement. At that point, the physician must confirm efficacy of our treatment with a follow-up sleep study. Physicians also agree a dentist (with appropriate training) is the professional to provide this therapy to patients. A dentist is uniquely trained to diagnose if a patient has dentition or implants stable enough to support OAT. Dentists are able to manage and predict potential side effects of treatment. The dentist can also decline to treat the patient if the risk of harm exceeds the potential benefit of the treatment and provide appropriate referrals. Oral appliances must be titrated to determine when maximum medical improvement has been reached. This cannot be determined by subjective symptoms alone. An objective test must be administered to determine if the appliance is reducing apneic episodes and improving oxygen desaturations during Dental Treatment of a Medical Condition - Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders MICHELLE ALDRICH, D.M.D.sleep. The Oregon Dental Practice ACT does not prohibit the use of this testing equipment. Extensive communication with our physician colleagues in the form of letters, FAX's, telephone calls, emails, etc., keeps them in the loop regarding the patients they have entrusted to our care. A major complaint of referring physicians is the lack of communication once the patient has been referred. Dentists must be consistent with communications so physicians can feel confident in the care of our mutual patients. It is recommended we do at least annual follow-ups to see if the appliance is still effective, functional, and the patient is compliant. These visits should also trigger a letter to the referring physician. Side effects, such as open contacts or change in occlusion, should be documented, and reviewed with the patient. It is the responsibility of the dentist to understand medical billing practices and not commit insurance fraud, even unintentionally. Insurance providers are not lenient in the case of ignorance. Protect yourself with knowledge and a mentor/organization with integrity. Recent communications with the OBD from a leading dental sleep organization is recommending a dentist be able to order the initial home sleep apnea test from a third party, have it scored and diagnosed by a physician remotely, and a prescription given for OAT, if appropriate. Their reasoning is the lack of sleep physicians and the huge societal burden of undiagnosed people with OSA. The OBD has not taken a formal position on this recommendation. Remember, the use of telehealth does not expand the scope of practice of a dental care provider. However, working in close cooperation with our physician colleagues would be the preferred path of treatment. Treating patients with OSA and SRBD can be a rewarding addition to your practice and provide a valuable service to your patients. Just like other specialties, if you chose not to provide this service, there are many knowledgeable providers you can collaborate with or refer to. Q: What information must I maintain in the patient record & give to the patient when placing implants? A: OAR 818-012-0070(4) Requires when a dental implant is placed the following information must be given to the patient and maintained in the patient record: (a) Manufacture brand; (b) Design name of implant; (c) Diameter and length; (d) Lot number; (e) Reference number; (f) Expiration date. The product labeling stickers containing the above information may also be used in satisfying this requirement. Frequently Asked Questions Frequently Asked QuestionsOREGON BOARD OF DENTISTRY August 2023 www.oregon.gov/dentistry 12a message ON wellNess frOm a message ON wellNess frOm Dr. julie sPaNiel , Dr. julie sPaNiel , OregON wellNess PrOgram OregON wellNess PrOgram Dentists have long been regarded as the guardians of health, dedicating ourselves to caring for our patients' needs, alleviating their fears while pursuing perfection in our work. However, behind our white coats lies a poignant reality -dentists, like anyone else, can suffer from mental health disorders, burnout, or substance use disorder, to name a few. This unspoken struggle affects our well-being, patient care, and the healthcare system as a whole. There are challenges faced by dentists with mental health disorders to seek care for us. Many of us simply suffer in silence due to the stigma surrounding mental health or substance abuse as a healthcare provider. The Oregon Dental Association takes mental health seriously and has partnered with the Oregon Wellness Program to provide complementary and confidential counseling and education to dentists in the state. The ODA understands the significant issues surrounding education, self-awareness, admittance of a problem and seeking help for any issues we may have with our mental health or substance use. The Wellness Ambassador program was implemented as a Confidential Peer to Peer model for dentists and dental students to simply talk with someone who understands. In 2020, the ODA partnered with the Oregon Wellness Plan and thanks to a 3-year grant from Permanente Associates, we were able to refer dentists for 8 free and confidential mental health sessions with a licensed therapist. The usage of OWP is now covered by a portion of our licensure fees. The program was founded in 2018 to support the well-being of Oregon healthcare professionals through education, research of the issue of burnout, as well as by delivering counseling and related services via in-person and telemedicine appointments. The p urpose of the Oregon Wellness Program is to ensure physicians, advanced care practitioners, dentists and other health care professionals within the state of Oregon have access to mental health support that is non-reported, urgently available, and complimentary. OWP contracts with licensed and credentialed mental health providers, who each have a minimum of five years professional experience providing services to health care professionals. OWP affiliated providers offer: Up to eight complimentary sessions per calendar year Appointments are generally available within three business days. Care without a \"paper trail\" or reporting to insurance or professional boards. Understanding and acknowledging the issues in our profession is the first step to awareness that there could be a problem. Self- evaluation and self-awareness through an honest lens is vital. 1. St ress and Pressure: Dentistry is a high-pressure profession, we often face tight schedules, deal with challenging cases, and must maintain a high level of precision in our work. The pressure to perform flawlessly and handle a variety of patient needs can lead to stress and anxiety. 2. Emotional Toll: We may encounter patients in pain or distress, and witnessing the emotional struggles of our patients can take a toll on their own well-being. The empathetic nature of healthcare work can be emotionally draining. 3. Long Working Hours: Many of us, especially in our first decade of practice, can work long hours, juggling between patient appointments, administrative tasks, and continuing education. The demanding schedule can leave little time for self-care and relaxation. 4. Financial Burden: Student loan debt affects nearly all recent graduates. Balancing work, school loans, cost of living, is extremely stressful in the first few years of practice and can limit choices. Starting and maintaining a private dental practice can be financially prohibitive. Financial stress contributes to mental health challenges. 5. Isolation: Solo practitioners or dentists working in smaller clinics can easily hide their issues from others. Physical or emotional isolation exacerbates the problems. 6. Perfectionism: Dentistry requires precision and attention to detail, leading some dentists to develop a perfectionist mindset, which can worsen stress and anxiety. Feelings of inadequacy or comparison to others can lower self-worth. 7. Limi ted Work-Life Balance: Struggling to balance personal life with the demands of a dental career can lead to burnout and negatively impact mental well-being. This can be especially true in the first decade of practice when balancing a growing family and finances. 8. St igma Surrounding Mental Health: The stigma surrounding mental health issues within the healthcare community may deter dentists from seeking help or admitting their challenges. Having insurance records show treatment sought for mental healthcare, or any written record of treatment can intimidate us from seeking the care we need. OREGON BOARD OF DENTISTRY August 2023 www.oregon.gov/dentistry 13Seeking help for mental health issues can be daunting for dentists. Fear of judgment from colleagues and the belief that admitting vulnerability may be perceived as weakness often prevents us from seeking support. The belief that we must be perfect and cannot have a human experience such as a mental health challenge, can also hinder their willingness to seek help, as they may feel they should always be strong and resilient. The ODA Wellness Ambassadors and the Oregon Wellness Program are available to help. Our profession is extremely rewarding. It is a career choice that affords us the ability to help others and bring a better quality of life to people's lives. But we cannot pour from an empty cup. We can only do our best if we are at our best. Good news for Oregon Board of Dentistry licensees! Start - ing August 18th, all licensees - dentists, dental therapists, and dental hygienists - will have access to highly confidential mental health services through the Oregon Wellness Program (OWP). Self-referral is all that is required and the Board is not involved or aware of anyone accessing it. The OBD included a policy option package in its 2023 -2025 legislatively approved budget to help fund this service through July 1, 2025. It more than likely will continue on after that as well. Any Licensee may contact the OWP and receive up to eight free visits per calendar year. Interested licensees can make a self-referral by visiting the OWP website to review available providers and contact providers directly to schedule an ap - pointment. Visits are available in-person or via telehealth. There is no reporting to a primary health provider or billing of insurance. The Oregon Board of Dentistry is committed and supportive of our licensees to utilize all available tools for success in their practice and in all aspects of life.

Many things may contribute to the decline in the practice of four-handed dentistry including the funds for Dental School, Dental Auxiliary Utilization (DAU) programs that dwindled during the past several years. This re-sulted in dental students who graduate without the extensive 4-handed dentistry training they once had. Interest in becoming a dental assistant has declined due to many reasons found in a study, Dental Workforce Shortages, Data to Navigate Today's Market by ADA, ADAA, ADHA and DANB. The pandemic which targeted dentistry as a highly contagious environment was a deterrent for many who were either working as a dental assistant or were thinking about becoming one. Or could it be the new high-tech dental equipment and techniques make it appear the need for a well-trained, four-handed dental team is no longer needed? ODAA believes four-handed dentistry is alive and well and the backbone of a successful dental practice. The dental assistant is the navigator and co-pilot who supports the dental practice not only chairside while working directly with patients but through - out the entire dental practice. This is also the opinion of many successful dentists. Oregon has 9 CODA community college dental assisting pro - grams located throughout the state. A variety of non-CODA Programs are available as well. All these programs focus on four-handed dentistry skills, how to support the dental prac-tice, provide optimum dental patient care and the importance of dental assisting as a profession. Also, the Oregon Board of Dentistry, Division 42 provides pathways to becoming a dental assistant through On-the-Job training by a licensed dentist. The concept of four-handed dentistry was founded in the 1960's. In her book Four Handed Dentistry, Betty Ladley Finkbeiner, CDA, RDA, MS, wrote \"Four-handed dentistry is a team con - cept where highly skilled individuals work together in an er - gonomically designed environment to improve productivity of the dental team, improve the quality of care for dental patients while protecting the physical well-being of the operating team. \" Although this was a concept created long ago it still exists in dental and dental assisting textbooks and if practiced can create a positive working environment where dental team members can thrive. OREGON BOARD OF DENTISTRY August 2023 www.oregon.gov/dentistry 15Along with the unique practice of four-handed dentistry, dental assistant expanded functions provide professional growth and an increase of production which in-turn increases profit for the dental practice. Business minded dentists engage in these con - cepts, use dental assistants to their fullest potential and are real - izing the benefit in a positive way. Getting the word out about dental assisting as a viable profes - sion has been challenging. High school career programs focus on dental school and dental hygiene as career options. Dental assisting is viewed as a pathway to these two careers and not nec - essarily a career that a person would remain employed in over a long period of time. ODAA is collaborating with Adec to create a video that demon - strates a dental team using four-handed dentistry techniques to perform restorative procedures on a \"live\" dental patient. The concept is to have a finished product that can be obtained at no cost by anyone who may be interested in showing how a dental assistant works with a dentist using four-handed skills. When a dental team works together using the four-handed den - tistry technique, it is a bit like a dance and requires little discus - sion of the procedure during the restoration process. Dentists rely on their dental assistants to use critical thinking skills and to anticipate. These skills take time for both the dentist and the dental assistant to learn but once developed there is no going back to dentists grabbing their own instruments or making their own temporary crowns. It is a seamless team effort that dentistry cannot afford to ignore. ameriC aN DeNtal tHeraPy ameriC aN DeNtal tHeraPy assOCiatiONassOCiatiON The American Dental Therapy Association (ADTA ) is a national organization (501c3) that promotes oral health and overall wellness to underserved communities, including American Indian/Alaska Natives, who have the largest dispar - ities in oral health and wellness. Our current board consists of 5 dental therapists from Oregon, Minnesota and Washing-ton. Our mission is to ensure that all Americans have access to high-quality oral health care. Founded in 2006, the American Dental Therapy Association (ADTA) is the national professional society for dental therapists. Each year, the ADTA supports dental therapists in providing vi-tal oral health care to hundreds of thousands of Americans. We educate the public about the value of dental therapists, create educational and career advancement opportunities for dental therapists, and support educational institutions in developing superior dental therapy programs. In 2022, the ADTA received an in-kind donation from the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and Communi - ty Catalyst to hire an interim Executive Director. We then were able to secure funding to hire a permanent staff member, an Ex - ecutive Director, who was hired in December of 2022; Cristi - na Bowerman. In April 2023 we were able to hire a part time communications staff member; Chelsea Luong. Since then, the ADTA has transformed from an all-volunteer led association to a staff run association. We greatly thank those before us that made this path possible. In 2022, the ADTA opened membership to all: dental therapists, dental therapy students, organizations, other oral health care provider types, and even members of the community. Inaugural Annual Conference: The ADTA is hosting its Inaugu- ral Annual Conference in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma October 5th-7th. The purpose of our conference being held in Oklaho - ma is to provide support to the state as they prepare to submit legislation that will authorize dental therapy in Oklahoma. This is meant to be an information session for professionals to net - work and learn all things dental therapy. There will also be den - tal continuing education offered up to 13.5 credits.
