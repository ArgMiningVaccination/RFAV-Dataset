On such legendary islands as Santorini and Mykonos, views of azure sea and white-washed villages will take your breath away. On your Greek islands cruise, you may embrace the magic and mythology of ancient temples built to honor Greek gods and goddesses. Visit UNESCO World Heritage Sites such as the amazing hilltop Acropolis in Athens, the haunts of St. John on the tiny island of Patmos, and the ancient Roman city of Ephesus. You may imagine you are Mark Antony, as you walk the same marble streets where the Roman general (and lover of Cleopatra) was once cheered by residents. Dine among the fascinating ruins as a complimentary treat, a Windstar-exclusive evening Destination Discovery Event planned for Ephesus. Windstar's Treasures of Greek Isles, and all other Greece itineraries, deliver you into the heart of Greek culture. As you cruise to Athens, call, too, at small secluded ports such as Monemvasia, a pedestrians-only village built into a cliffside, and Nafplio, a delightful mainland town where you can wander cobblestone streets and explore Venetian fortresses. On your Windstar small ship cruise, Greece unfolds at a leisurely pace. You'll have time to linger in magical places, to swim from powdery sand beaches, to explore local cuisine and get to know friendly locals, shouting \"ya mas\" (\"cheers\") as you toast with ouzo. You may even dance like Zorba the Greek at a local taverna. Your Windstar cruise is the best of Greece, the way you imagined it. Looking for more?
