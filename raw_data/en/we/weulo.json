Take a look in your makeup drawer and tell me what you see. A lot of plastic tubes, compacts and containers? Yep, that's about right. Most makeup - both conventional and clean makeup brands - comes in plastic packaging. Plastic is cheap and it's easy - but it has a negative environmental impact and we should be looking for [ways to use less plastic](https://mindfulmomma.com/how-to-reduce-plastic-use/) any time we can. If you are looking to switch up your beauty routine to [clean beauty products](https://mindfulmomma.com/non-toxic-beauty/), be sure to seek out sustainable makeup brands that offer plastic-free, refillable or zero waste packaging as well. Fortunately the beauty industry has evolved and now there are quite a few eco friendly makeup brands. In my opinion, the best non-toxic makeup brands are sustainable too! Zero Waste Packaging for Makeup So what makes makeup packaging sustainable? Let's answer a few questions: Does recyclable packaging count? It's easy to get lulled into thinking that if we recycle plastic, we've solved the problem. The truth is that [91% of plastic is not recycled](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/07/plastic-produced-recycling-waste-ocean-trash-debris-environment/) at all. Plus, most plastic makeup tubes and compacts are not recyclable anyway. If all a company is doing is bragging that you can recycle their plastic containers, then no - that's not sustainable. But if they are using sustainable materials that are also recyclable at the end of their useful life, then yes - that is great. Does sustainable packaging have to be plastic-free? It's pretty hard to create makeup packaging that is 100% plastic free - although some brands manage to pull it off! (Axiology is a great example) Any company that is striving to reduce plastic waste is taking a step in the right direction in my opinion. Can makeup packaging be zero waste? Zero waste is a great inspirational goal, but most brands aren't there. (see some of the Etsy shops I mention below for as close to zero waste makeup as you'll get!) How about refillable makeup? I'm a huge fan of refillable makeup packaging! It's not very common but a few brands are doing it! (see Beautycounter, Elate, Kjaer Weis and Alima Pure below) Sustainable makeup packaging comes in lots of forms. Let's take a look at some of them: - Glass: used for bottles, containers and tubes (likely recyclable) - Metal: used for lids and tubes (might be recyclable) - Bamboo: used for makeup compacts and lipstick tubes (compostable) - Paperboard tubes: used for lipsticks and cheek colors (biodegradable/compostable packaging) - Post consumer recycled paper: used for boxes (recyclable) - FSC-certified paper: used for boxes (recyclable) - Recycled plastic: used for bottles, compacts, tubes and other parts (bottles may be recyclable but most other items are not) Don't worry about being perfect - just do your best to avoid the plastic bottles, tubes and extra outer packaging, and look for cosmetics packaged in sustainable materials as often as possible.
