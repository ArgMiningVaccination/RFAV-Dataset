Your provider has told you a service is not covered by insurance, or the provider does not accept insurance, but you still choose to get care; 2. You told your provider before you got care that you would pay, even if the care wasn't covered by Sanford Health Plan; 3. You knew services weren't covered or you chose not to get prior-approval and you told the provider you would pay if insurance denied your claim; or 4. You choose to get (or continue to get) denied services during the appeal process and the Plan or a State Fair Hearing determined that the services would remain denied; or 5. You were not eligible for North Dakota Medicaid Expansion coverage during the time when you received the health care service. What is not paid for by this plan? Some services are not covered. For a complete list, please see your Certificate of Coverage (policy). If you need another copy of your Certificate of Coverage, please contact us or log in to your member portal. For covered drugs, contact the Department of Human Services. The North Dakota Department of Human Services is in charge of drug benefits and services for Medicaid Expansion Sanford Health Plan does not pay for: Care from an Out-of-Network Provider, unless it's emergency care or prior-approved by Sanford Health Plan Any care before you are eligible for the plan or after your coverage with this plan ends, as determined by the North Dakota Department of Human Services Medical Service Division Pastoral, financial or legal counseling Section 5: Are There Times When Sanford Health Plan Will Not Pay for Care?

If you have other health insurance, please contact Sanford Health Plan so we can work with the other company to pay for your care. 16What is a primary care provider (PCP)? A primary care provider can be a: Family or general practice provider Nurse practitioner (CNP) Physician's assistant (PA) Internist (Adult doctor) Pediatrician (Child doctor) Obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN) A health site such as a federally qualified health center (FQHC), Indian Health Service (HIS) facility, or a rural health clinic (RHC) How do I choose a primary care provider if I don't have one? Review the provider directory at sanfordhealthplan.com or log in to your member portal at sanfordhealthplan.com/memberlogin to find primary care providers in the network. If the provider you have now is in the network, they can continue to be your primary provider. If your current provider is not in the Sanford Health Plan network, you will need to choose a provider in the network. You may want to choose a provider who is close to your home. See the section below for instructions to verify your provider is in the network. What providers are in the Sanford Health Plan Medicaid Expansion Network? Sanford Health Plan contracts with providers in health care facilities within the North Dakota service area (North Dakota and counties that border North Dakota in Minnesota, South Dakota and Montana) to meet the needs of our Members. Always check the provider directory to make sure the doctor you want to go to is in network BEFORE you receive care. You can choose to see any of the health care providers listed in the provider directory for the Medicaid Expansion plan. If you are going to get health care services outside of the network, you or your provider must get prior-approval from Sanford Health Plan. If you do not get prior-approval, you may have to pay for the services you receive and the Plan may not pay anything. When you get services from a provider not in the network, you are receiving services \"out-of- network.\" There is no coverage for out-of-network care unless you, or your provider, get prior- approval from the Plan or the care is urgent, emergent, or for family planning services. Section 7: How Do I Get Care? You must use in-network providers when you need health care. 17What if my provider leaves the network? If your provider leaves the network, Sanford Health Plan will contact you by mail and help you find a new provider. Sometimes, you may be able to continue care with a provider who has left the network for a period of time. For example, you are pregnant or have a terminal illness, you may be able to continue treatment. This is called continuity of care. Contact us if you would like Sanford Health Plan to consider continuity of care for you. Your request will be reviewed. The decision will be based on your medical condition and the provider's enrollment status with the Plan. What if I need to see a specialist? If you need medical care that your primary care provider is not able to provide, he or she may ask you to see a specialist. A specialist is a provider with training in a specific area of medicine, such as a dermatologist - a provider who checks the skin. When your primary care provider asks you to see a specialist, this is called a referral. You, or your primary care provider, do not need prior approval from the plan for you to see an in-network specialist. Sanford Health Plan will pay for the specialty care if medically necessary. When you are referred to an Out-of-Network Provider, you or your provider must first contact us for prior- approval. If you do not get prior-approval, you will have to pay the bill and the health plan may not pay anything, unless your care was urgent or emergent. Remember, by law, the Plan cannot pay you back for costs you pay to doctors, hospitals, or clinics, so it is important to get approval from the Plan before you get care. Do I always need a referral for Out-of-Network care? No. If you are a woman, native American/Alaska Native, or in need of family planning services, see below. Women: You can see an obstetrician or gynecologist in network without a referral. You may also get other women's health specialist services from any network provider without a referral. Pregnant women: Women may get routine obstetrics and gynecology care from their primary care provider. You may also get this care from an obstetrician or gynecologist who is in network. You don't need a referral for maternity care, including office visits and Pap tests. Women who are already pregnant may be able to see an out-of-network provider; but you must call to get prior-approval. It is important for you to contact your local county social service office when you become pregnant; they will help you decide if you should switch to the traditional Medicaid program. This plan does not cover babies. If you are pregnant or think you are pregnant, it is very important to see a provider a soon as possible. Call Sanford Health Plan to enroll in the Healthy Pregnancy Program, where you will get free information about extra services just for you while you are pregnant. Family planning services: Sanford Health Plan offers family planning services through your primary care provider, an obstetrician or gynecologist. Call Customer Service if you need help finding a clinic. You may visit any family planning clinic without a referral. 18American Indian/Alaska Native primary care provider choice: Care you receive from Indian Health Service (IHS), Indian Tribes, Tribal Organizations, Urban Indian Organizations, or through a referral under contract health services (CHS), is covered by Sanford Health Plan as in-network. If you already have a primary care provider at one of these places, you can keep that provider and the services he or she gives you will be in-network. If you are eligible to get care at these facilities, the same rights apply and you can pick a PCP who works at that facility. Sanford Health Plan pays an Indian health care provider through referral under CHS the same as any other provider in the network. Call Customer Service if you need help you need help finding an Indian health care provider. You may visit any Indian health care provider without a referral.

If your provider refers you to a health system outside the ND Medicaid Expansion Service Area (the state of ND and bordering counties in Montana, South Dakota, and Minnesota), you or your provider must call BEFORE you go for prior-approval. What if I see an out-of-network provider? Sanford Health Plan only pays for out-of-network care if an in-network provider cannot provide the care you need. To see an out-of-network provider, you need to get prior approval by the Plan. What if I travel outside the Sanford Health Plan North Dakota Medicaid Expansion service area? Emergency and urgent care If you have a medical emergency when you are not in the state of North Dakota or a surrounding county, call 911 or go to the nearest medical facility. Call your primary care provider within 10 days to let them know about your emergency so they can help arrange your follow-up care. Non-urgent or non-emergency care When you are outside of the service area, Sanford Health Plan does not pay for routine care. Only family planning, urgent and emergency care is paid for when you are outside of the service area. This Plan does not cover any services received outside the United States. How can I get more information about my provider? You can ask for information about your provider at any time. Call Customer Service and they can answer these questions about your provider: Is a provider on the Sanford Health Plan provider network list? What are the professional credentials of Sanford Health Plan's network providers? Can I get a list of providers who speak languages other than English? What are the prior-approval requirements, limits, restrictions, or exclusions? How does Sanford Health Plan pay its providers? NOTE: Sanford Health Plan does not pay providers in a way that would prevent you from getting the care you need. If you have questions or need further assistance, contact Customer Service at (855) 305-5060. Representatives are available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. TTY users should call (877) 652-1844 (toll-free). 20Prior-approval is the process of getting an approval from Sanford Health Plan for certain prescriptions, treatments or health care. Health care providers that are part of the Sanford Health Plan network usually send Sanford Health Plan the information needed to approve your care. However, you are in the end responsible for making sure the services listed below get prior-approval if you are not sure the Plan has approved the service, be sure to call or ask your provider before you receive care. Examples of services that must get prior-approval : Any overnight stay that is not an emergency in a hospital or other facility, such as a stay in a skilled nursing or a residential treatment facility Care from an Out-of-Network hospital, clinic, provider or specialist Care from a Provider outside of the North Dakota Medicaid Expansion Service Area. Health care workers in your home Outpatient surgeries Durable medical equipment, orthotics and prosthetics Organ or tissue transplant services Genetic tests Select drugs administered under the medical benefit Surgery for morbid obesity (bariatric surgery) Cochlear implantsSection 8: What is Prior Approval and when do I need it?

Your network primary care provider has agreed to be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for emergency and urgent care. Be sure to call during normal business hours (usually Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) for routine care, and only call after hours for care you need right away. Your provider may see you, or send you to an acute care center, the emergency room, or to another provider. What if I need care right away? After-hours or urgent care centers provide services for illnesses that need to be treated within 48 hours, such as the flu, fevers or a sore throat when you cannot see your primary care provider. You might also go to urgent care for ear infections or low back pain. You don't need a referral or prior-approval to go to an urgent care center. In-network urgent care centers near you are listed in the Provider Directory. If you go to an after-hours or urgent care center, we encourage you to contact your primary care provider within 24 hours to arrange follow- up care. If you aren't sure if you need care right away, call your provider get their recommendation. If there is not an after-hours or urgent care center close to where you are, go to the nearest emergency room if your regular doctor's office is closed and you can't wait for an appointment. What do I do in an emergency? An emergency is a health problem that starts suddenly and needs care right away. In an emergency, if you don't get medical attention right away, your health, or the health of your unborn baby (if you are pregnant) may be in danger, your body functions may be damaged or an organ or other part of your body may not work properly again. Emergency conditions may include severe pain, chest pain, problems breathing, bleeding that will not stop, broken bones or sudden loss of strength. If calling your primary care provider first would delay getting the help you need in an emergency, go to the nearest emergency room or call 911. You don't need a referral or prior-approval to get emergency care. If you get emergency care, contact your primary care provider as soon as reasonably possible, and no later than ten (10) calendar days after you are physically or mentally able to do so to arrange follow-up care.

Let your wishes be known: Complete a Health Care Advance Directive There may come a time when you cannot tell others how you want to be cared for and about your choices for health care. By making a plan now, you can choose how you want your wishes to be carried out. Under North Dakota state law (N.D.C.C. ch. 23-06.5), you have the right and responsibility to make the decisions relating to your own health care, including the decision to have health care provided, withheld or withdrawn. This means you can make decisions about your medical care, you have the right to accept or refuse treatment, and you can create instructions, what is called a \"Health Care Advance Directive\" about how you want to get medical care if you are unable to make decisions. For example, if you are unconscious or unable to speak. A Health Care Advance Directive is a written document that has your health care instructions, a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, or both. Your rights to make a Health Care Advance Directive: The steps listed below can help. 1. First, let family, friends and your provider know what kinds of treatment you do or don't want. 2. Second, you can appoint someone you trust to make health care decisions for you if you are unable to express your wishes. This person will be your \"Agent\". 3. Third, it is best if you put your thoughts in writing. 4. Once you have your thoughts in writing, you are ready to finish your Health Care Directive. It must be signed by you in front of a notary public or at least two witnesses, who are at least eighteen (18) years old. The notary public and your witnesses may not be: a. in charge of your estate or will if you die; or b. your spouse; or c. a person related to you by blood, marriage, or adoption; or d. someone who would get money or other benefits from your death. NOTE: You do not have to use a lawyer, but you may wish to speak with one about this. What is a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care? A Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care allows you to give some other person the legal right to make health care choices for you if you are not able to make them yourself. What is a Living Will? A Living Will is a paper that gives instructions to your provider for when you want life-aiding care to be given, withheld or withdrawn. You can sign a Living Will - a record that sets out steps for future care. A durable power of attorney for health care is a type of living will. 33Living wills can be signed and copies should go to: The person you trust for making choices in the event you are not able to speak for yourself; The hospital where you are most likely to be treated; and Your provider. You can change your mind about these documents at any time. Sanford Health Plan can help you understand or help you get these documents. We respect your rights if you want to make a Health Care Advance Directive, but you are not required to make one. Under State law (N.D.C.C. \u00a7 23-06.5- 10), you can choose whether to have a Durable Power of Attorney, a Living Will, or a Health Care Advance Directive; not having these documents will not change your right to quality health care benefits. Services covered by the Plan will not be refused if these documents are not in place. Their only purpose is to let others know what you want if you cannot speak for yourself. Conscientious objections A health care provider may not follow your wishes if they go against his or her conscience. This means it is possible that a specific treatment or medication you list in your advance directive, living will or durable power of attorney may be provided or denied to you because the provider cannot, in good conscience, authorize it. If so, he or she will help you find someone else who will follow your wishes. In addition, health care facilities are not required to implement an advance directive if there is an institution-wide conscientious objection and state law allows such an objection. (N.D.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 23-06.5-09 to 23-06.5-13). For more information on advance care directives, visit sanfordhealthplan.com or call Customer Service.

If there is a pattern of using services that are not needed or abuse/ misuse of benefits, or you commit fraud, Sanford Health Plan may restrict you (lock you in) to a certain provider or clinic. This program is called the Coordinated Services Program (CSP). Sanford Health Plan will send you a letter if this happens. The letter will tell you what provider or clinic you must use and how long you'll be in the CSP (lock-in) program. Coordinated Services Program (CSP) Members utilizing health care services at a frequency or amount that is not medically necessary, and that exceeds generally accepted medical standards, will be placed in a CSP after review by, and upon, the recommendation of a Health Plan medical professionals and consultation with the North Dakota Department of Human Services Medical Service Division. Examples of actions that may cause you to be placed into the CSP include seeking duplicative, excessive, contraindicated, or conflicting health care services, including prescription drugs, from multiple providers, and/or the abuse, misuse, or fraudulent actions relating to benefits or Plan services. Section 17: If You Misuse Your Benefits 39The following criteria will be used to determine if the CSP is appropriate: a. Seriousness of incorrect, improper or excessive utilization of services b. Historical utilization of health care services c. Availability of a coordinated services physician When a member is placed in the CSP, the Plan will provide written notice to the member, which will include: 1. The reason why the member is being placed on the CSP; 2. The member's right to file an appeal (See Section 7, Problem Resolution, for information on appeals); and 3. The timeframe in which the member has to file an appeal. Once a member has exhausted the Plan's internal appeals process, the member has a right to a State Fair Hearing and the Plan will inform the member of the timeframe in which to file a request for such a hearing. The CSP administered by the Plan is in compliance with lock-in requirements set forth in 42 CFR \u00a7431.54.
