Taking this product without enough liquid may cause choking. Probiotic Pearls acidophilus: Take 1 softgel daily. May be taken with or without food. Do not chew or crush. Detox Activation cleansing formula: Day 1-8: Adults take 5 tablets with 8 oz of water in the evening. Day 9-10: Adults take 3 tablets with 8 oz of water in the evening. Warning Magnesium hydroxide is effective for the relief of occasional constipation.* It is an \"osmotic laxative\" and uses water to flush fecal matter out of the intestines. When water is drawn into the intestines, fecal matter absorbs the excess water as it forms into bowel movements. As this material swells, it puts pressure on the sides of the intestines, initiating peristalsis - the act of moving the bowels. It is as effective as stimulant laxatives such as cascara and senna. True Dispersion Technology fiber ensures that the psyllium, other ingredients such as oat bran, guar gum, and pectin, are completely released and dispersed for thorough colon cleansing.* Encapsulated fiber supplements have limited surface area in which to trap and bind products of detoxification. Because True Dispersion Technology fiber completely disperses, it is both comfortable and provides superior surface area to bind toxins for elimination.* Psyllium is one of the most preferred cleansing fibers because of its ability to bind toxins, increase stool bulk, and support regularity.* Whole Body Cleanse Complete 10-Day Cleansing System with Probiotics* Give your whole body a chance to cleanse and revitalize with this 10-day program.
