Mission Statement, Strategic Objectives, Goals and Performance Metrics The mission of the Department of Health (DOH) is to protect and improve the health and environment for all people in Hawaii. Health, that optimal state of physical, mental, social and environmental well- being, is a right and responsibility for all Hawaii's people. The focus of DOH's strategic objective s is to \"Make Health Hawaii's Shared Value.\" Strategic objectives focus on: Invest ing in healthy babies and families , Taking health to where people live, work, learn, and play, Creating a culture of health throughout Hawaii, Address ing the social determinants of health, Using evidence- based practices and make data -driven decisions, and Improv ing core business services and customer satisfaction. The goals for DOH are to: Promote health and well -being , Prevent disease and injury , Promote health y lifestyles and workplaces , Promote the strength and integrity of families and communities, Preserve a health y and natural environment by promoting resource conservation (recycling) and protection and enhancement of air and water quality, To assure basic physical and mental health care, called \"the five A's\" o Available o Accessible o Appropriate o Assur ed quality o Affordable. Due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, the department focus ed on improving and continuing to provide access to DOH services while being at the forefront of the State's COVID response . The COVID -19 pandemic challenged DOH to be innovative and creative in how to provide continued access to services, including the use of technology for communicating with our clients and 2 stakeholders and providing services via virtual meetings and consultations. The DOH also took advantage of existing informati on technology platforms for processing of documents and providing a mechanism for the community to communicate and access information related to the COVID -19 pandemic and other DOH services and resources. Impact of Current State -Wide conditions on Agenc y Operations The DOH continues to monitor critical program needs and funding availability to promote its mission and to provide services to the general public. The COVID- 19 pandemic and the economic downturn of the State as a result of the pandemic has m ade the DOH more prudent in its approach to spending on the most critical program needs and encouraged the use of all available funding sources. Some of the activities and accomplishments for the Department this past year include: General Administration: In response to the COVID- 19 pandemic, the Department: o Developed programs for and implemented isolation and quarantine facilities and supportive services, contact tracing, community and school testing services, provided test kits to underser ved areas, community outreach and education, and vaccine promotion and distribution for over 1.3 million people ; o Conducted critical public health laboratory COVID whole genomic sequencing and variant analyses; o Worked with Federal, State, private and other healthcare organizations to provide surge capacity and relief by securing funding, nurses and allied health professionals from out- of-state to provide relief to our already taxed healthcare system across the state ; o Helped to implement the Safe Travels Program for out -of-state visitors and returning residents to the State of Hawaii and to ensure that proper precautions such as isolation and quarantine policies were monitored to reduce the spread of the COVID -19 virus . o Initia ted satellite vital statistics offices on the neighbor islands to provide birth, marriage, and death certificates on -island in addition to receiving assistance with their orders. This satellite service compliments the on -line and mail- in ordering services and in -person services at the main office located in Kinau Hale on the island of Oahu. The Health Resources Administration served as the strategic lead in providing the expertise, support, and resources for the COVID- 19 response for the State: o Served as strategic lead for the COVID- 19 vaccination response, coordinating distribution and administration of over 2.5 million COVID -19 vaccine doses by government and independent healthcare providers across the state ; 3 o Established a system for COVID- 19 surveillan ce in Hawaii including reporting, contact- tracing, whole -genome sequencing, real -time analysis of case and testing trends, and public -facing dashboards to provide pandemic situational awareness in support of policy decisions ; o Investigated over 116,000 posi tive COVID -19 laboratory reports statewide from March 1, 2020 to present; o Established formal partnerships with community non- profit organizations that have been working on the frontline of the pandemic including activities such as food drives, masks and hand sanitizer distribution, social media education campaigns, and door- to-door outreach events; o Contributed to \"flattening the curve\" of the COVID- 19 pandemic for marginalized communities including Pacific Island er populations through community engagement and prioritizing education and outreach related to isolation, quarantine, mitigation and vaccines, and by making vaccines readily accessible to disproportionately impacted populations; o Developed p ublic and privat e partnerships to improve access to COVID- 19 community testing; especially in high social vulnerability index areas. o Convene d a working group of community partner organizations to serve NHPIF community members. The organizations identify needs and increa se reach into the limited English proficiency (LEP) populations. o Co-created and increased access to translated material and messages for Native Hawaiian, other Pacific Islander, and Filipino (NHPIF) and other populations where English is not a primary lang uage and who have been disproportionately impacted by COVID- 19; o Instigated to expand ed school COVID -19 testing programs accessible to all Hawaii public and charter schools. With federal award funding support and in collaboration with Department of Educatio n, established contracts with Hawaii Primary Care Association and Hawaii Keiki Nurses to strengthen School Health programs across the state; o Provided vaccinations for first responders , essential workers and the public through collaboration with State and c ounty partners. The Public Health Nurses also provided community outreach, education, testing, and linkages to resources, particularly for hard -to-reach populations. They expanded community capacity, whenever possible, through collaboration with communit ies, Hawaii Public Housing Authority, Hawaiian Homestead, FQHCs, National Guard, and community providers . Behavioral Health Administration: Completion of the Hawaii State Hospital 144 -bed facility. Efforts are currently underway to transition staff and patients into the new facility. 4 AMHD has cared for those with serious mental illness during the COVID- 19 pandemic while helping our infectious disease Oahu DOH partners by supporting isolation and quarantine services and vaccinating over 40,000 Hawaii residents at our Windward Vaccine POD. Oahu and Neighbor Island Community Mental Health Center ( CMHC ) staff supported COVID -19 response efforts on their Islands while continuing to provide services as safely as possible during the changing face of the pandemic. We focused our efforts to decriminalize mental illness by working with the Judiciary to ensure that Act 26 /SLH 2020 was implemented on Oahu and started steps for the implementation on the Neighbor Islands as well. Overall, we have had close to 60 individuals go through Act 26 (designed to ensure rapid evaluations of fitness for those that have been charged with a petty non- violent misdemeanors). This has led to reducing the time to first fitness evaluation (and linkage to care) with over 60% of the individuals released after the evaluation period accepting services. 45 of the 58 individuals were not found fit and were able to avoid incarceration and be evaluated and linked to services instead. Approximately 65% of those released have not been re - arrested, and most that have accepted assistance have not been re -arrested. AMHD also piloted stabilizatio n beds at 'Ekolu on the grounds of the Hawaii State Hospital (HSH) as well as in Kona, with plans for increasing the number of stabilization beds across the state in 2022. The Hawaii State Hospital through proactive measures, has been able to prevent any widespread outbreak of Covid- 19 at the facility and to date has had no more than five positive cases among patients at the facility. Ho'ola Na Pua is a new program the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Division began working with in early fiscal year 20 22. This residential facility is located on the North Shore of Oahu and provides services to teenage girls who are suspected, or who have been confirmed, to be victims of sex trafficking. This program addresses mental health issues related to sex traffick ing specifically, and it is anticipated that fewer girls will need out- of-state residential programs for this kind of specialty care. The CAMHD has been working on expanding the in- state residential care options, especially for females. There has not been a residential program that specializes in the needs of adolescent females for several years. This means more children being treated locally which is always a great thing. Through a Federally funded SAMHSA Grant, CAMHD has a program for youth and young adults experiencing a First Episode of Psychosis called OnTrack. OnTrack is being expanded to reach as many clients as possible. This has minimal funding and in the first years there were only about 4 clients, but with expanded funding and additional new staff, there are now 14 active clients. We have achieved this by loosening administrative and clinical criteria, hiring new staff, and actively seeking new cases by collaborating with our system partners. Children's Mental Health Awareness Month in May saw CAMHD getting the word out with virtual events, press releases and appearances by CAMHD leaders on various TV 5 programs. Even though many activities couldn't be done in person it was still a huge success thanks to a Division- wide effort to show our passion for helping kids and families. The Developmental Disabilities Division received approval from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to expend $14.6 million in federal funds attributable to a temporary 10 percent increase in the federal medical assist ance percentage (FMAP). These funds must be used to strengthen, enhance, and expand the Medicaid 1915(c) Home and Community Based Services Waiver for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, and can supplement, not supplant, existing s tate funding. DDD will use the funds to implement fourteen initiatives including to increase provider rates, create a workforce development initiative, add a new waiver service for people with co -occurring mental health issues, and training the workforce. Environmental Health Administration: Established the Surface Water Protection Branch - Administers statewide functions related to protecting residents and visitors by regulating nonpoint sources of ocean and freshwater pollution; and implements portions o f the federal Clean Water Act. The new branch regulates nonpoint source pollution to state waters through the administration, enforcement, and implementation of all laws, rules, and programs; fosters partnerships with other agencies involved in nonpoint source pollution control; promotes community -based watershed management through education and voluntary compliance with environmental management standards; provides federal funding for demonstration of best management practice (BMP) projects from the public and private sectors relating to nonpoint source control; and encourages and supports programs for environmental education. Implements Clean Water Act, PL 95 -217; HRS Chapter 342E; HAR, Title 11, Chapter 11 -56 Nonpoint Source Pollution Control. EHA staff quickly mobilized and confirmed the reports of petroleum odor and contamination in the Navy's drinking water system on Oahu. The EHA marshaled its subject matter experts and surge capacity staff from the State Laboratory, Environmental Health Services, Environmental Management Division, Hazard Evaluation and Emergency Response Office, Environmental Information Management, and Environmental Resources, and other DOH offices to respond to the emergency and to ascertain the ext ent of the impact. Coordination, planning, operations, logistics, and finance tasks involve collecting, testing, and analyzing water samples, crisis communication , responding to public inquiries and complaints, GIS mapping, procurement, cost accounting, an d coordination with the U.S. Navy, Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, Hawaii's Congressional delegation, and others. The Department of Health, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Army, and the U.S. EPA established an Interagency Drinking Water System (IDWS) Team to restore 6 safe drinking water to affected Joint Base Pearl Harbor- Hickam (JBPHH) housing communities. The working group will ensure that the agencies are coordinated in actions to restore safe drinking water to Navy water system users and that they have a clear, coordinated source of information as work continues to restore safe drinking water. One of the first actions of the IDWS Team was to develop and si gn a Sampling Plan that meets State of Hawaii and EPA drinking water standards. DOH Issued an order to the U.S. Navy to suspend operations at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, take measures to treat contaminated drinking water at the Red Hill shaft, and safely remove fuel from the 20 underground storage tank facility at Red Hill. DOH is developing a new Hawaii hemp processing program to establish and regulate a system of registering hemp processors. The Interim Hemp Rules, Chapter 11 -37 Hemp Processi ng and Hemp Products, HAR, became effective on August 9, 2021. DOH continues to take important steps in combatting climate change and towards achieving Hawaii's greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals by capping GHG emissions from Hawaii's largest stationary air pollution sources. To date, 19 air permits have been issued requiring 16% reductions in GHG emissions from these facilities. DOH staff continue to improve the ambient air quality monitoring network on the Big Island in response to Kilauea eruptions. Th e air monitoring network protects public health and safety by providing reliable and current air quality information to the public and emergency responders. Health Resources Administration: As previously mentioned in the \"General Administration\" section, the Health Resources Administration served as the strategic lead in providing the expertise, support, and resources for the COVID -19 response for the State . Conducted 134 federal recertification surveys of Medicare -eligible healthc are facilities, 34 compliant inspections, 27 COVID -19 focused infection control (FIC) surveys, and 2 COVID -19 complaint investigations; and conducted 1,985 State licensing surveys and 231 complaint investigations of healthcare facilities and 51 investigations of unlicensed activities. FIC surveys were newly mandated by CMS to ensure timely compliance with CMS and CDC infection control requirements to prevent or minimize the spread of COVID -19; Initiated transfer of Emergency Medical Services from the State to the City and County of Honolulu on track for completion in FY 2023. Implemented new NEMSIS 3.4 pre -hospital medical record system statewide making Hawaii compliant with National standards, Hawaii Department of Transportation regulations and the Emergency Medical Services Division of the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration. 7 Initiated transport of Emergency Medical Services patients with non- emergent needs to approved alternative destinations on Oahu encouraging patient transport to the most appropriate destination, optimizing patient care while helping to decompress hospital emergency departments Federal Funds In general, the Department of Health's federal funding has remained relatively stable in FY22 with no significant adjustments anticipated in FY23. Increases in federal funding for FY22 are for the Department's COVID- 19 pandemic response activities for the State. Through a partnership with the Department of Budget & Finance, and Department of Defense - Hawa ii Emergency Management Agency, DOH secured over $100M in funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to support vaccination providers and testing services across the state. These funds reflect additional support for critical and urgent COVID- resp onse activities above and beyond the allocations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Environmental Health Administration: Significant funding increases are anticipated for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and Drinking Water State Revo lving Fund from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The estimated total allotment for Hawaii for FY2022 is $68,398,000 and $401,465,000 over FY22- FY26. The funds will expand the ability to support eligible projects, remediate emerging contaminants, and replace lead service lines. The Laboratory Preparedness and Response Branch (LPRB) of SLD is funded (except for one FTE) by Federal grants. During the past year LPRB has done whole genome seque ncing and variant identification for COVID- 19 cases. The speed and volume of variant identification for the State of Hawaii makes the State one of the leaders in these metrics nationwide. Rapid detection of the introduction of delta and omicron variants have enabled the Department of Health to make well-informed decisions about enhanced control measures. Federal funding has also enabled SLD to test large numbers of swab samples for the presence of SARS -CoV-2, in support of COVID -19 control activities led by the Disease Outbreak Control Division. Health Resources Administration: The Family Health Services Division received a $2.2 million federal Pediatric Mental Health Care Access (PMHCA ) grant. This grant provides the state $445,000 a year for the next five years to address pediatric mental health care for children and youth ages 3 to 21 years. The purpose of the PMHCA program is to promote behavioral health integration into pediatric pr imary care using telehealth, which has increased tremendously during the COVID -19 pandemic in order to curb disease transmission and lessen the burden on hospitals and doctors' offices. The Department has applied for various federal grants to address COVI D-19 health disparities: 8 The National Initiative to Address COVID -19 Health Disparities Among Populations at High- Risk and Underserved, Including Racial and Ethnic Minority Populations and Rural Communities has four strategies that are being implemented through a departmental approach to expand testing and vaccination, to improve data collection and reporting, build infrastructure, and to mobilize partners and collaborators. (OT21 -2103 \"health equity grant.\") Budget Period 06/01/2021 g rant amount for two years: $24,512,230.00. The Community Health Workers for COVID Response and Resilient Communities (CCR) federal grant serves residents across the four counties to focus the efforts of community health workers (CHW) on communities that h ave disproportionately higher prevalence of COVID -19, lower vaccine participation, and are at higher risk for poor health outcomes, including but not limited to the priority population of Native Hawaiians, Other Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos (NHOPIF). This project will collaborate with governmental and community -based organizations to train, deploy, and engage community health workers (CHWs). (DP21-2109 Project Description). Budget Period 8/31/2021 to 8/30/2024. Total grant amount approved for year o ne: $2,289,855.00 (Annual grant amount will be based on availability of funding from the CDC and satisfactory performance by the state. Grant total for three years is potentially $6,869,565.00. ) Non -General Funds Pursuant to HRS 37 -47, below is a web link to the Department of Health's non- general funds: https://health.hawaii.gov/orgchart/fy22 -non -general -fund -reports/ Budget Requests in Relation to Strategic Objectives, Goals and Performance Metrics The COVID -19 pandemic has challenged DOH in its efforts to keep up with the increased demand for services provided by DOH. The economic downturn caused by the pandemic reduced general fund resources available to meet the increased demand for mental health services, pandemic response support and outreach, and the ongoing day -to-day operations of the DOH. With the slow reopening of the State to tourism, businesses, and other governmental and non- governmental functi ons, it is unclear when the State will be able to recover economically from the pandemic. With federal support through the CARES and ARPA funding, the DOH has been able to provide increased support and outreach and leverage the general fund resources for our critical non- pandemic program needs. As the federal funding for the COVID -19 pandemic is reduced, infrastructure needed to respond to and mitigate future public health emergencies will need to be funded to enable DOH to continue to meet its mission obligations , goals and objectives and to maintain a comprehensive and detailed actionable emergency plan . The Executive Supplemental Budget for FY 2023 for the Department of Health provides 20.57 new general funded FTE and $23,128,774 in additional general funded resources. The approach taken in developing our budget request focused on core services previously not fully funded and difficulties encountered in maintaining services as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic and the subsequent economic downturn of the State. Biennium 9 funding requests that were not funded were also reviewed for consideration and re -submission in this supplemental budget request. A few of the priority requests are highlighted below with background information. Behavioral Health Administration: OR-1 Additional operating funds for the new Hawaii State Hospital Forensic Building ($3,487,633 -A) Additional funding is being requested to cover increased expenses for the larger building and higher patient census including additional security guard services to monitor the building, maintenance contracts for infrastructure and patient treatment mall operations. Now that the faci lity is complete, a more thorough review of resources needed has been done, resulting in the request for additional funding. Nursing services at the hospital will add another patient unit, thus resulting in additional resources for security services. Add itional security guards are needed to securely operate all areas of the forensic building, including the lobby entry/exit, monitor cameras and alarms from the central security center and perform dedicated patrols on all patient care units. Maintenance contracts for the facility must be issued to properly maintain the building. These maintenance contracts are for HVAC, elevators, Security CCTV and door access control systems, fire life safety, telephone and wi -fi system. Other costs include contracts for refuse collection, window washing, building utility costs, and patient treatment mall operations, housekeeping and central supplies. OR-3 Increase the FTE from .50 to 1.00 for position 122752 Program Specialist IV to continue administer the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Contract. An increase in the FTE is requested from .50 to 1.00 for position 122752, Program Specialist IV, which is fully federally funded through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Contract and approved by the FDA. Since 2017 the FDA contract to conduct tobacco retail inspections included a .50 FTE position 122752 Program Specialist IV. In 2018, the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division converted temporary, exempt special project positions that would exceed five (5) years to temporary, civil- service positions. However, we have not been successful in recruiting qualified applicants, and those initially interested decline the position due to location and/or the part- time, temporary status of the position. A new four -year FDA contract was secured on September 20, 2020 to continue conducting tobacco retail inspections and includes funds for changing the .50 FTE Program Specialist IV position 122752 to a 1.00 FTE Program Specialist IV. OR-12 9817 ARPA Funds to address ARPA requirement to supplement, not supplant existing state funds. ($9,668,664 - A) Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA, Public Law 117 -2) to address the ongoing effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic. Section 9817 of the ARPA provides a temporary 10 percentage point increase in the federal medical assistance 10 percentage (FMAP) for home and community -based services (HCBS), such as the Medicaid 1915(c) waiver operated by the Developmental Disa bilities Division (DDD). \u00a79817 of the ARPA frees up state dollars to be reinvested in the program. Funds attributed to the FMAP increase may be used to supplement, not supplant, existing state funds. DDD estimates that the ARPA FMAP increase will result i n an additional $14.6 million in federal funds and corresponding savings of an equal amount of state funds. These state dollars will be eligible for additional federal matching funds so the estimated total funding available for enhancing, expanding, and strengthening HCBS is more than $30 million. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) gave states until March 31, 2024 to expend the funds based on an approved Spending Plan. This budget request will allow the State to ensure Maintenance of Effor t requirements in \u00a79817 of the ARPA. Based on public input, DDD will implement fourteen initiatives that will strengthen and enhance services and supports provided through 1915(c) Waiver for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities acro ss the State. UP-11 Transfer special funds to various programs to fund 6 unfunded permanent positions (-6.00/0.00A); (6.00;0.00B) A local survey of caregivers found that almost half of respondents are seeing a negative mental health impact on their kids due to the pandemic. This is observed mostly as depression and anxiety. Local emergency departments are also seeing a rise in admissions for adolescents for psychiatric reasons. These outcomes are similar to national findings. In early 2021 U.S. emergenc y departments saw a 51% and 4% increase in admissions for suspected suicide attempts for females and males respectively. Six (6) critical positions to CAMHD were defunded in the 2019 Legislative session. CAMHD is requesting that these 6 positions be change d from General Fund positions to Special Fund positions and funding be transferred to support the filling of these positions. Among these positions are the CAMHD Administrator. CAMHD has been operating with a temporarily assigned administrator since July 2 019. While the work has been accomplished, this is not the ideal way to operate a Division providing mental health services to all youth within the state. In addition, there is a Planner and Contracts Specialist in the CAMHD Administration. There are also three (3) positions that are in the Family Guidance Centers in the State, two (2) of which are care coordinators that provide direct services to the youth, one in Waimea on the Big Island and one in Honolulu. The other is an Administrative Specialist in th e Family Court Liaison Branch Environmental Health Administration: OR-32 Change MOF from special funds to general funds for 2.00 permanent Environmental Health Specialists for asbestos and lead regulation avoid reduction- in-force (2.00 perm/0.00 temp/157,332A, -2.00 perm/0.00 temp/0B). The revenue and cash balance of the Asbestos and Lead Abatement special fund are not adequate to support these positions that perform essential functions. 11 OR-41 Add 1.00 permanent Engineer (Environmental) VI position and funds for program development and technical support in the Clean Air Branch (1.00 perm/0.00 temp/85,248B). This section supervisor position is crucial to address deficiencies in compliance with federal Clean Air Act require ments, including developing and implementing new state and federally mandated air programs, greenhouse gas and climate change requirements, and to provide technical support for Clean Air Branch operations and planning. UP-10, FY -18, UP- 26, TO- 27, and OR-38 Add funds and transfer funds to provide budgeted salaries for 2.00 Vector Control positions on Kauai, 1.00 Food Safety position on Maui, 4.00 positions for Clean Air, 4.00 for Solid and Hazardous Waste, 1.00 for Clean Water, and 3.00 for State Laboratories. Funding the salaries for these essential positions will enable the programs to fill vacancies and retain incumbents to accomplish required workload. The salaries were defunded by Act 9, SLH 2020 and Act 88, SLH 2021. OR-35 Restoration of Electricity Budget in State Laboratories Division ($150,000A). OR-36 Establish a DUI Laboratory for State Drug and Alcohol Toxicology Testing (0.00 perm/2.00 temp/$102,101B). DOH supports legislation required to implement Act 196, SLH2021, enabling the creation of the State drug and alcohol toxicology testing laboratory. DOH supports enhanced efforts by the Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS) to support and enable Federally funded construction projects for enhanced laboratory facilities at the SLD and at the Kauai District Health Laboratory. Federal funding for these critically needed facility enhancements must be spent by the end of October 2024. If DAGS can devote sufficient resources to the planning and approval s teps, these projects could be completed on time and enable these laboratories to be prepared for future pandemics and other emergencies. Health Resources Administration: OR-6 Request to fully fund Disease Outbreak Division Chief and Deputy positions ($36,040- A) It is imperative to increase budget allocation to fully cover competitive salaries for the State Epidemiologist (DOCD Division Chief) and Deputy State Epidemiologist (Deputy DOCD Division Chief). These core public health positions study disease in populations, track the causes and consequences of infectious diseases and provide critical information for program and policy decisions. Historic salaries are not competitive and resulted in multiple year vacancies in critical DOCD leadership positions needed for developing and implementing strategies to strengthen and sustain the Division and Department. Inability to raise the budgeted salary would ultimately result in DOCD being unable to fill other vacancies that are budgeted under general funds. DOCD positions budgeted under general funds are all core positions required for efficient and effective administration of the Division as well as management of the portfolio of fe deral award funds the Division and other programs within the Department of Health have received for COVID -19 response. Additionally, without the ability to successfully recruit a qualified candidate 12 for the Deputy State Epidemiologist position, the burden of work on the State Epidemiologist and other DOCD program leads is unreasonable and further turnover is anticipated. The lack of backup to the State Epidemiologist compromises the State's ability to maintain current activities, including ongoing COVID -19 response, as well as the ability to respond to any new, emerging disease threats. OR-29 Request to fund 3.00 positions and operational expenses for the Office of Medical Cannabis Control and Regulation ($ 516,612) to ensure that products dispensed by medi cal cannabis licensees do not pose a health risk to patients and for public and patient education to prevent unintentional intoxication of children, impaired driving, and risks of cannabis use . Capital Improvement Projects : In FY23, CIP funds are being requested for the following projects at Kalaupapa: $7,809,000 in construction funds is requested to close the second landfill at Kalaupapa. Design is already funded and in progress. $945,000 in construction funds for the re -roofing of a warehouse facility a nd care facility currently in use. $580,000 in design funds for the closure and removal of underground storage tanks. The Executive Supplemental requests also include trade -off transfer requests which consist of housekeeping adjustments to reduce negative personal services adjustment budget lines and other housekeeping requests to fold in statutorily exempt positions and align the budget to previously acknowledged reorganizations. Federal fund adjustment requests are also being submitted to align the federal budget ceiling with updated actual and anticipated federal fund awards. The DOH continues to address the health of our State through a combination of population health management and strategic partnerships to address the needs of our most vulnerable populations. We look forward to advancing Hawaii's health agenda through the leveraging of resources and capitalizing on health care reform options which support accessible, affordable, and quality health care.

With the loss of positions due to budget cuts over the years, the facility is no longer able to adequately staff more than one position per shift. Many patients are quite elderly and now require one on one care. When only one staff is assigned on a shift, and a patient falls or is injured, that staff member will be unable to respond to other patients who require care. The facility has had to evacuate patients when the fire alarm was activated. With only one staff member assigned on night shift, it was very challenging to move all the patients to a safe location in a timely manner. The increased acuity of the patients requires two nursing staff per shift to deliver proper care and for patient and employee safety. In FY 2020 and 2021, Hale Mohalu paid $102,998 and $123,964, respectfully in overtime, and in FY 2021 an additional 330 hours of compensation time off was earned in lieu of cash payment.A - - - 3.00 - 122,526 HTH100 DG AR 2 HS-4 Request for Business Services Supervisor III and Building Maintenance Worker I positions to replace essential mission critical positions in Kalaupapa that were deleted per Act 009, SLH 2020.The Business Services Supervisor III (BSS) position deleted per Act 009, SLH 2020.

While HRO position count has remained relatively static over the past decade, the DOH has experienced increases in positions and required actions, resulting in a backlog and delayed processing of actions which negatively impacts the ability of DOH Programs to effectively gain and retain its most critical resource - employees. Since 2014, the HRO has experienced an increase in classification actions due to attaining delegation for reorganizations, and grew to 600+ required actions most recently in 2019 as result of the Hawaii State Hospital completing a reorganization. In recent years, the DOH has also increased its position counts to support the new patient facility at the Hawaii State Hospital and its critical public health functions during this pandemic. As a result of the high volume of classification and employee transactions required to support the establishment and maintenance of increased position counts, the HRO is requesting three (3) 1.00 FTE positions to ensure it can sustain effective and timely service of all of its functional areas (labor relations; classification and compensation; recruitment and examination; training, safety, employee relations; and employee benefits and transactions) which are necessary for its Programs to fulfill their missions and support the DOH's mission to protect and improve the health and environment for all in the State of Hawaii.

The re-establishment of some of these positions and functions will help the department more effectively address health issues in a holistic and coordinated manner that is also closer to where people live, work, and play. Moreover, because the State of Hawaii only has a State Health Department and no true local or county public health agencies, having staff embedded within various communities allows for more timely, tailored responses to local public health needs. This brings public health resources and information to the community at the right time, in the right place, and with the right partners. Additionally, these staff will serve to strengthen internal department coordination by crosslinking programs and providing qualitative information to compliment current quantitative data collection and analysis systems.

It is becoming more routine for the Legislature to enact laws with the specificity of administrative rules due to frustration and impatience with the Executive Branch. As a result, agencies are squandering their constitutional responsibility by ceding back to the Legislature subject-matter expertise and oversight.

Influx of federal award funds have allowed the Division to greatly scale up surveillance, response, and informatics activities to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, expansion of funds and activities requires commensurate increase in administrative capacity. Administrative functions are less able to be fulfilled through emergency federal funds because of challenges in recruiting and training on a short-term basis the needed administrative staff, who must understand state processes and be granted access to and trained on state systems. DOCD has already shifted a large proportion of state budgeted funds towards personnel costs in order to meet hiring needs, and as a result is challenged to cover supplies, equipment, and other non-personnel costs related to the work of these positions. Further restriction of budgeted funds would threaten the ability of the Division to manage core activities and administer emergency federal funds. With the increased turnover of staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, unanticipated costs related to retirement of state personnel and requirements for programs to cover accrued leave payouts can further destabilize the Division's ability to meet budgeted needs. 2022 HTH420 HO A 41,265,710 $ 812,638 $ 42,078,348 $ 1.97% The restriction limits the Adult Mental Health Division's ability to support community alternatives to Hawaii State Hospital (HSH) inpatient commitment and discharge placements after HSH treatment for approximately 130 individuals. 2022 HTH430 HQ A $87,811,711.00 1,688,072 $ 86,123,639 $ 1.9% Reduce valuable contracts with Kahi Mohala and Correct Care that assist with patient census management.

This contract provides telepsychiatry for eligible Child and Adolescent Mental Health Division (CAMHD) youth by fellows in the DOP program. These youth receive medication evaluation and management, assessments and treatment. This reduction reduces the number of fellows that can provide these services to the youth in the programs. As there is a shortage of psychiatrists in Hawaii, this program helps CAMHD and the health plans reach youth that are located in rural areas. 2021 HTH501 CM A 2,619,281 $ 648,854 $ 1,970,427 - CARE Hawaii, Inc.; Crisis Network Services; -$333,821 This would reduce the contract for the crisis network services which provide statewide crisis call responses, crisis mobile outreach, and the crisis residential on Oahu for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are experiencing a behavioral or psychiatric crisis. This would result in a diminished crisis response system for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, inclusive of a crisis shelter, resulting in greatly increased emergency room use and admission to hospital acute psychiatric settings for these individuals. These services are billed wherever possible to the 1915(c) waiver, but not all costs are covered, for example when the telephonic crisis is stabilized at that level and does not result in a crisis mobile outreach, it cannot be billed as a waiver service. Also, room and board for the crisis shelter and follow up crisis response, which can avert future crisis, cannot be billed to Medicaid. Crisis services are required in DDD Statute HRS 333F.Long-Term Adult Supports & Resources contract to Goodwill Industries of Hawaii; -$302,728 This would reduce services to individuals not in the HCBS waiver who are not eligible for Medicaid, or are waiting to be enrolled in the waiver. The requirement for provision of services to individuals eligible for DDD is mandated under \u00a7333F-2(c)(3)&(4)18-151 - Brenda J. Wong; Psychological Eval Services; -$12,305This would eliminate funds for psychological evaluation services which are contracted for individuals applying for DDD services who don't have current evaluations. Impacts the ability to process timely eligibility applications due to inability to assess functional limitations as is required in HRS 333-F. Delays the provision of services. There is litigation history regarding delays that resulted in a waitlist for services including Makin v. State of Hawai'i (Civil No. 98-00997) brought by individuals who had been placed on a waitlist for the DD Waiver and followed by a settlement in HDRC v. State of Hawai'i (Civil No. 03-00524) that requires the timely delivery of services to all eligible applicants and no waitlist for services. 2021 HTH501 CU related expenditures; -$6,958 Reduce travel and per diem for staff.

Queen's Medical Center, Dental Clinic; -$150,000 The Queen's Medical Center (QMC) Dental Clinic maintains the only facilities, equipment, and staff that can provide the needed service in Hawaii for adult patients whose conditions are seriously compromised by medical conditions or by inherent physical, mental, or intellectual/developmental disabilities so as to prevent the delivery of services in a customary dental setting. In Hawaii, the QMC Dental Clinic is the only clinic that provides hospital dentistry (dental care under general anesthesia) for these vulnerable adult populations. QMC provides general dental and oral surgery services concentrating on, but not limited to, disabled and medically compromised patients. The delivery of these services require facilities, equipment, and staff common to both a surgical theatre and dental operatory. The HCDSB contracts with QMC to provide general dental and oral surgery services under a hospital setting for the vulnerable adult populations that cannot receive dental care in traditional dental clinic or office. The reduction of funds will significantly affect the QMC Dental Clinic's budget to financially support the dental clinic. These funds are critical to maintain and support the clinic facilities, operations, and personnel expenses. This reduction of funds will directly affect their overall capacity to provide treatment to the community and HCDSB referral patients. 2021 HTH501 JA A reimbursement; related expenditures; -$24,494 Reduce travel and per diem for staff.

Over time, these buildings, because of their remote location, have been vandalized or have become night encampment for homeless individuals, prompting the need for security services. Staff are reluctant to provide any work after work hours or weekends as a result. This contract is jointly funded by Adult Mental Health Division which providers 24/7 crisis line services from this location.

Reduction in this contract would mean the inability to provide CMS mandated supports for consumer-directed (CD) participants in the Medicaid 1915(c) Waiver. The CD component of the Waiver allows participants to serve as the employer of record for their service employees and manage a set amount of dollars allocated for their CD services. The structure of the CD program removes the State from any co-employer liability and gives flexibility for the employer to obtain quality services. CMS incorporates the use of a Financial Management Services (FMS) entity which Hawaii uses to provide: (1) an Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) system for recording employee worktime (federally mandated under Section 12006(a) of the 21st Century Cures Act), (2) payment of employees, (3) withholding and deposit of employer and employee taxes, (4) ensuring compliance with federal and state regulations for employers. In addition, the FMS contractor provides training and tools for CD employers to manage and reallocate funds within the annual amount of Medicaid dollars allocated for their CD services. Since most CD employers are family member of participants, they are not paid and provider agency administrative expenses are not incorporated into the CD unit rates; enabling cost savings for the State. 2021 HTH501 JO A <Continued from above> Without these FMS supports, the State is: (1) at risk for being a co-employer and assumes liability for over 1600 CD employees, (2) not in compliance with federal and state labor and tax regulations and subject to any hearings and subsequent penalties, (3) not in compliance with the provisions of the CMS approved Waiver. A reduction in the FMS contract would significantly jeopardize the compliance of the state with the 1915(c) Waiver. 19-142 University of Hawaii; Center for Disability Studies Projects; -$443,074 This would eliminate contracts to the University of Hawaii, Center for Disability.
