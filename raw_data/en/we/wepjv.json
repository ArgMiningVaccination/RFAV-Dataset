Before the syndrome was completely understood and its cause isolated, public health officials embarked on an aggressive program of public ed- ucation, prevention, patient assessment and counseling, and research. With leadership and input from individuals personally affected by the disease, the Department worked directly with community organizations to develop programs that addressed the unique needs of at-risk popu- lations and people with AIDS. The Department's AIDS Prevention Project would come to serve as a model for public health agencies across the nation, and it informed responses to future public health crises. The spread of HIV/AIDS in King Coun ty would be less significant than in cities such as New York and San Francisco. But by 1996, before ef-fective treatment was developed, over 3,000 people in King County would die from AIDS-related diseases, and the impact of the disease is still felt to this day. \"The ground shifted with AIDS.

The cause of AIDS was not yet understood, and there was no treatment and no cure. By 1982, AIDS was known to be transmitted not only by sexual contact, but also by contact with infected blood, through transfusions or shared injection needles. The deadly nature and the po- tential for rapid spread of the new disease was soon recognized as a public health emergency.

This was an immediate challenge for local public health. The number of cases in the region increased steadily, mostly but not exclusively among gay men. The first deaths in the region occurred in Tacoma and Seattle in the spring of 1983. The Seattle-King County Department of Public Health participated in public events, organized by health leaders in the gay community, to share the latest medical understanding of the threatened epidemic. By early 1983 community groups had taken the lead in organizing support and services for people with AIDS. The Seattle Gay Clinic (an all-volunteer organiza tion that provided STD screening, physical exams, counseling, and referrals), the Northwest AIDS Foun dation, and others would become important part- ners to Seattle-King County Public Health.

He really wants to get out of the hospital, he does not want to stay in the hospital, but I know there's no one to help him be cause his lover has left him and his fami- ly has disowned him and he's kind of an angry guy and there's not much more we can do for him, and he wants to be discharged, but I'm afraid to discharge him because there's no one at home to help him.\" So I said well, I think that's something we can help with. And I just decided that I would go out and meet this guy at home the day after he was discharged, to fig- ure out what we might be able to do. So I went to his apartment and explained that we had this network. He didn't want to be called someone with AIDS be- cause he wasn't someone with AIDS. Eventually he was diagnosed with AIDS. And he was pretty skeptical and he was a difficult guy, and you've got a very an- gry guy, but he needs help. So I said, \"I can help you get some groceries. We've got these other volunteers who can help you if you need to get to a doctor's ap- pointment or whatnot.\" And he said, \"Well, I really need someone to clean out my bathtub.\" So I thought okay, this is where we learn by doing, so I just stayed with him and helped him get settled back in his apartment. And he was pretty upset because his lover had left him. I'm describing that first day with him, trying to get to know him and get to know his situation. There was a picture on the wall of his apar tment, it was a picture of somebody that I vaguely recognized, and I thought it might be his lover. So I said \"gee, that looks familiar - is that a picture of your lover?\" And he looked at me and said, \"No, Tim - that's me.\" But he had change d so much that he didn't look anything like his photograph. And I'd vaguely know n him in the community and that's why I recognized his photograph, but it was ha rd for me to make the connection be- tween the photo and him, because his body had changed so much, and he had been through so much. And you know, we just kind of sat down and cried togeth-er. So I contacted Josh and Stan and others, so we could sort of spell off on each other, driving this guy to get groceries or helping him out at home. He'd intermit- tently get angry at one or some of us, so we learned by kind of this very difficult initiation.

Research Seattle's University of Washington Medical School was known for its research into sexually transmitted diseases. Some Public Health De- partment doctors were also associated with the medical school. Dr. Hunter Handsfield, head of Public Health's STD program, in 1982 was stud- ying a lymph-gland disorder that might relate to AIDS. Already a nationally recognized leader in STD research and prevention, Handsfield helped forge policies and made recommenda- tions to the federal Centers for Disease Control for a national response to the emerging epidem-ic. Collaboration in Seattle Robert Wood: But one of the things about Seattle I think that was really fortunate was th at we had the ability to work together. In going around the country and looking at how other cities were dealing with HIV- AIDS, there was often a lot of competition and that didn't seem to be so much the case in Seat-tle. There was a little, when we had an opportuni-ty to go after some mone y from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, I know Swedish was thinking about going after it itself, and wasn't sure that the health department should proceed to go after the money. But I think Patric ia actually talked Swe- dish into kind of bowing out and letting the health department pursue it. so there were really good cooperative efforts that occurred within Seattle. One time we had a visitor from Margaret Ham- burg, who right now is the head of the FDA, but at the time she was the medical officer, the chief of public health in New York City, and she came out a n d s a i d , \" H o w c o m e y o u h a v e s u c h g r e a t r e l a -tionships with the university?\" And to me it was really simple, because we only had one university (laughs) and in New York City they had Albert Ein-stein and Columbia and Cornell and Montefiori and Mt. Sinai, all these different entities that were all wanting a piece of various pies, and in Seattle it was fairly simple - we just had one university to work with, and we had a great university. King Holmes and all the people that had been working on sexually transmitted diseases over the years geared up really early on and were a great set of allies for us, and both Hunter and I had appointments in the univer sity as well, and were involved in teaching medical residents. So we really had our legs in to getting word out about A I D S . S o t h a t w a s a b i g p a r t o f t h e c o m m u n i t y was the university, but then there were also these burgeoning community organizations that all wanted a piece of the pie, as the pie got bigger, and more and more people realized that AIDS was going to impact them.

[11-6-7] Still, some saw Public Health's venereal dis- ease clinic services as punitive in tone and in- sensitive to privacy needs. In 1982, to better understand and respond to the needs of the gay community, Public He alth, with input from volunteers from the Seattle Gay Clinic, formed the STD Advisory Committee, focused on STD's in gay men. Its membership drew from the Public Health Department, Seattle Gay Clinic, and the Dorian Group, a gay rights organiza-tion. Local support for gay rights and gay rights activism In some areas of the United States, hostility towards gay people slowed or undercut efforts to address the AIDS epidemic. This was less the case in Seattle. The city had passed civil rights ordinances that prohibited discrimina- tion based on sexual orientation in the 1970s. In 1978, citizens' Initiative 13 sought to repeal these ordinances as they applied to gay peo- ple, but broad coalitions formed, and the measure was defeated at the polls by a margin of two to one. This experience of community members working together for common ends greatly helped Seattle and King County re-spond to the AIDS epidemic four years later.

(http://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/exhibits-and-education/digital- document-libraries/gay-rights-in-the-1970s/) A History of STD outreach The Public Health Department had a long history (see right) of treating sexually transmitted dis-eases. STD prevention and treatment programs included outreach to men who had sexual con- tact with other men. Responding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 7 KING COUNTY ARCHIVESFrom \"Social Disease\" to \"Love Needs Care\" From before 1890 until 1947, Seattle's Depart- ment of Health and Sanitation was responsible for the control of sexually transmitted diseases in the region. Control techniques included contact tracing, anti-prostitution campaigns, hospitalization, and quarantine (in or out of jails). World War II introduced new populations and social dynamics into the Seattle area, as well as the use of penicillin as a treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. This led to an enhanced postwar cam-paign by the newly unified (1947) Seattle-King County Department of Public Health. Intervention was based on education, detection, and treatment. You might have seen this advertisement on a Seattle Transit bus in the 1940s and 1950s. \"The Road to Health,\" 1954. Series 872, King County documents collection. The department's Venereal Disease Clinic won na- tional attention with its idea of putting posters in public transit coaches with the message that quick and simple tests were available for VD, as well as quick and simple treatment. Rather than reinforcing the stigma of \"social diseases,\" post World War II outreach materials treated the problem in a cheery, scientific manner. Left: A cheery, scientific approach to VD testing.

Series 1825 - History files, Seattle-King County Department of Public Health: Prevention Division / HIV-AIDS Program.[1825-1-6] KING COUNTY ARCHIVESTim Burak: You know, I told you my own story about how I felt I didn't get first class care at Public Health and quite many of the gay men who showed up at the Seattle Gay Clinic we re either afraid to go to Public Health - I mean, for one thing, it was in the same building as the police department, and in those days, you kn ow, I'm forgetting the exact year, but in many states it was still illegal fo r men to have sex with men. There was the Harwick case in the Supreme Court and whatnot. Even though Seattle and King County were fairly progressive and had an open housing and employment ordinance that protected gay men and lesbians, there was still a lot of fear and difficulty about being out, and some of that had to do with going to doctors, going to Pu blic Health clinics, etc. So the Gay Clinic, setting up as an alternative to all that, often we heard stories from folks who told us why they didn't want to go to a private doctor and why they didn't want to go to the Pub lic Health Department, etc. So we learned a lot about that. And I had a foot in a couple of camps - my day job was at Public Health, and I volunt eered at the Gay Clinic, you know, I got to hear both sides quite a bit. There was maybe one sort of flashpoint, and this again was before the AIDS epidemic, just before it. There was some back and fo rth tension between the Public Health Department and the Gay Clinic, but not just at our gay clinic. We were part of a movement across the country of many gay clinics that had sprung up at about that time and were trying to do the same kind of thing, each in our ow n way. Some of the clinics had more re- sources than we had, and had grown to be bigger entities now. But some public health officials, including our own director of the STD program in those days, Dr. Hand sfield, were critical of these freestandin g gay clinics and Hunter felt that they were counterproductive because they might keep people from going to Public Health Department's and getting a wider range of services and more extensive follow up care than a frees tanding gay clinic could provide. So Hunter wrote an arti- cle for the American Public Health Associ ation's journal that was critical of the phenomenon of freestanding gay clinics for that reason - he felt it was keeping people from going to pl aces where they could get more comprehensive care, i.e., Public Health Department's. It happened that in those days I went to the annual national meetings of the American Public Health Association every year, and I joined the gay and lesbian caucus of the APHA and the month that that letter came out, I went to our meeting in Los Angeles and here are my colleagues in the gay and lesbian caucus talking about that Dr. Hunter Handsfield from Seattle who doesn't like gay clinics. So I was there and I knew Hunter, we're fr iends. So we talked about that, and a group within the caucus decided to write a letter in response, arguing in favor of the importance of freestanding gay clinics . So I came back to Seattle and I talked to Dr. Handsfield, and I said you know, that's a very controversial letter. A lot of con- versation about it at the American Public Health Association and you're going to get some responses. And he said well, I'll handle that. And indeed, there was a le tter submitted and he wrote a follow up le tter. Hunter and I spoke several times around that, and I suggested to him why do n't you actually come out to the clinic on a weekend and sit with us and see what we do. I think that might better inform you about what we 're doing, and if there's someth ing that we're not doing that's comprehensive enough, maybe we could improve the situation. An d to his credit, he did. He came for a couple Saturdays and volunteered and worked with us, comple tely - what's the word? I don't want to say untrained, but civilian non-medic types like me were doing STD screens, but we were doing it un der the direction of volunteer doctors and nurses, and he got to watch that, to see what that really looked like and if ther e were some ways that some quality assurance could be built into what we were doing. So what came from that was a collaboration that in retrospect I think was a very, very positive collaboration, and less con- flict. And the idea that we finally agreed upon was the streng th of the Gay Clinic was that we could be a magnet for people who for whatever reason were never going to show up at a Public Health Department STD clinic or private doc or university operation. And we could provide a basic service and we would do that in conjunction with the health department to make sure that we were gathering specimens correctly, giving results correctly. But when we identified clients who needed follow up that we couldn't provide, we would stay with them as kind of case managers and work with the Public Health Depart-ment to make sure that they eventually got to the STD clinic or to another place where appropriate follow up could be done. And that was the model that we worked on for several years. The conversations around working out that model, coordinat- ed largely by Dr. Handsfield and his nursing staff and STD clin ic staff, there was a monthly gathering that we had that we called the Gay STD task force that involved staff from the Pu blic Health Department and volunteer staff from the Seattle Gay Clinic and some volunteers from other orga nizations like the Dorian group, for example. Eventually it was a group that happened to be in place when th e first cases of AIDS were identified in Seattle, and because we had those conversations going, there wasn't this big sc hism between public health and the Gay Clinic anymore .

The program served populations such as refugees, jail inmates, and low-income senior citizens. Experience reaching out to under-served communi- ties also informed Public Health's response to AIDS. (Oral history interview, July 2015.) Seattle-King County's Experience Patricia McInturff: ...we had the right people in the community. I used to say that some of them could get to the mayor a lot faster than I could. Espe- cially in the gay community where it went first - people who understood politics, who played politics, who knew who to call and how to call them. We had the University which at the time I think did more research on sexually transmitted diseases than any university in the United States. We had good people in the health department and we had good people running community based agencies. They were smart. Seattle-King County's Experience Gary Goldbaum: Well, Seattle's always been really progressive, and it was one of the leaders nationwide in certainly community level intervention strate-gies. Washington State 1988, that legislation- that was way ahead of its time. I don't think but a half dozen states followed in the next few years with comparable legislation. So we started with a state that was really ahead of most others, and then a place like Seattle, which was always pretty progressive, there were a lot of good connections already be- tween the communities that were being affect-ed and government, and frankly the public health institution really understood, we've got to get a head start on this.

Dr. Robert Wood was an early NWAF Board president. NWAF was instrumental in helping promulgate Public Health's prevention messages and strategies. State and local officials, including King County Executive Randy Revelle, Seattle Mayor Charles Royer, and City and County Councilmembers, along with other community leaders, served on NWAF's Honorary Board of Directors. From the mid 1980s, most public funding of other AIDS service organizations passed through NWAF.

The plan was developed in collaboration with th e Seattle Gay Clinic and included funding for the AIDS hotline and one nurse practitioner. King County Executive Randy Revelle recogn ized the need to fu nd AIDS programs without waiting for the next County budget cycle. He understood the implications of AIDS and its coming storm an d supported emergency action, in spite of advice to the contrary from some advisors.

King County Council Ordinance 6476 allocating funds for the proposed AIDS Surveillance and Education Program. By August 1, 1983, both the Seattle City Council and the King County Council had passed emergency funding ordinances. Together they became the second local jurisdiction in the United States, after San Francisco, to allocate public funding directly for the fight against AIDS. The Gay Community's Involvement in Creating an AIDS Assessment Project The proposal would establish a formal partnership between the Department an d the Seattle Gay Clinic. Tim Burak de- scribed this relationship in this 1983 program summary referre d to in his APHA presentation. (Transcript next page.) Community activists, organized by the Dorian Grou p, the Greater Seattle Bu siness Association, and the Seattle Gay Clinic, rallied at City Hall and spoke befo re the Seattle City Council. Representatives from the Northwest Physicians for Human Rights, the Freedom So cialist Party, the Seattle Mayor's Office, the Seat- tle Office of Women's Rights, and Seattle-King County Department of Public Health, all supported emer- gency funding. The proposal: The AIDS Surveillance and Education Program KING COUNTY ARCHIVESWhat is \"surveillance\"? Sharon Hopkins interviewed by Lawrence Knopp: ...what we call public health sur- veillance. Which is a term that has a very bad connotation outside the realm of public health, but it means counting the cases, analyz- ing who's getting HIV, why they're getting HIV, what populations are impacted, what are the trends? Is the disease increasing/ decreasing? What are the risk fac- tors? That's where you can get into a little more research. Are certain types of injection drug us- ers more at risk? Gay men, lesbi- ans - who was at risk? That's the type of thing I was doing. When you think of research, most people think of laboratory or big studies and so on, but this was more what we call public health surveillance. LK: Would that be more sort of data analysis, data cleaning? SH: The big thing was data collection. At th e time what we called full-blown AIDS people, people who were very sick with AIDS, legally had to be reported to the Public Health Depart- ment at the local level and then those data were eventually transmitted to the state and maintained. Then we would analyze them - ho w many people had died, how many were male, female, age group, risk factors, etc. and make that data public on an aggregate level. That helped inform where did the prevention services need to go, what the hospitals and doctors should expect for future case numbers, etc. So that was the job. The day I started, Will Jones was one of the first employees of the AIDS Project and he handed me what we call a line list, essentially an 8 x 11 piece of paper that had a listing of everybody who'd been reported with AIDS in King County. I counted them, there was 140 people on this handwritten list, and that was the basis of the surveillance program. And of course that was maintained in a locked up situation, but that's what I started with. I think it was in pencil, as I recall, which seemed kind of odd.

Maybe not even through sex, but fears of getting it somehow by another kid being at school or falling down on the play- ground and having some sort of con-tact with a child who was bleeding. Other people I think look for a place for their generalized anxiety to reside, so they had absolutely no personal reason to be afraid but lock onto something like this to express their anxiety. And then other people are having sex and they're worried... This 1983 brochure answered questions with an honest assessment of the current knowledge about how to avoid contracting AIDS .

KING COUNTY ARCHIVESMistrust While Public Health worked closely with organizations such as the Seattle Gay Clinic, many in the gay community mistrusted the idea of a \"surveilla nce\" program, fearing that patient names might appear on government lists that could be used to discriminate against them based on their sexu- ality or illness. In 1983, the Department had to reassure the community that Seattle police were not maintaining lists of people with AI DS. See the Department's news release.

[1825-1-10] The Media Public Health leaders worked closely with local media to promote public understanding about AIDS and to discourage sensationalist In 1984, Seattle's public television station, KCTS-TV, produced a Peabody-award-winning documentary program, Diagnosis AIDS, about the Seattle- King County response to AIDS. Some public television stations in other parts of the United States refused to air the program, citing its \"controversial\" nature. Local efforts working with the media sometimes met with mixed results. In 1986, only one of three major local television stations would air a public service announcement produced by the Northwest AIDS Foundation and funded by Public Health and the federal Centers for Disease Control. Responding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 21 KING COUNTY ARCHIVESMaking Public Health the Source Patricia McInturff: We wanted the media to come to us, the health depart ment. We wanted to be the person they went to as opposed to someone in the community who might not have the same public health perspective we did. We always said that good ci vil rights is good public health, an d vice versa. But nevertheless, we wanted AIDS to be a public health problem, not a civil rights problem, and we thought if we kept it public health, we could keep people from breaking up. So we had a rule that we accepted calls from the me- dia 24 hours a day, no matter where you were - yes, they could come to your house; yes, they could call you. If they didn't know what that word was in a story or how to describe it , we made ourselves totally available to them. And I think because we never blew them off, we knew they had deadlines - because we knew the minute we didn't answer the question, \"Why is this strain of the disease better than that?\" or \"Why can't you get AIDS this way instead of that way?\" they'd go to some body else and then we'd have to spend our time trying to correct. Because there was a lot of bad information out there about AIDS - how could you get it, how coul d you not get it. Especially in th e early days. We used to say you put sex and death together, just gets all kinds of pr oblems. So the media knew we were always availa- ble and we made ourselves available, and we cultivated them. Sensationalism Hunter Handsfield interviewed by Lawrence Knopp: HH: So they had a ten minute segment on the peak hour KING evening news, I think Lori Matsuka- wa, was she also with KING? LK: Before she was at KOMO. I think that's right. HH: Anyway, he talks to met ahead of time, he know s all the deal, he knows the stuff, he's not go- ing to make this inflammatory and so on, but at newspapers - I think even no w, I don't really know very often anymore - I know at newspapers and I think at radio stations, the people who write the sto- ries often are disconnected from those who write th e headlines and the grabbers, and they sort of had this intentional firewall, that the headline writers were supposed to be able to look at this and not feel obligated to coordinate. Well, sometimes you'd get a headline that was inflammatory over a story that was sober. Well, this time I'm getting ready to go live on the air, and whoever does the voiceover intro- duces me and says, \"AIDS is here. It's rampant. It's infecting everybody. As fa r as we know, it's infect- ing your dog and your cat. This is the plague - \" I mean, it was just inflammatory horseshit, it was just - and this voiceover is going on, and Mike James, am I remembering right? My brain slipped a sec- ond. So Mike's looking at me and his eyes are getting big and mine are getting big as we hear whoever's reading this voiceover so we spent the next ten minutes correcting the misinformation from the introduction before we got into the meat of the important stuff. Responding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 22 KING COUNTY ARCHIVESScientific progress: HIV testing In 1984, scientists discovered the HI V virus, the cause of AIDS, and de- veloped an experimental antibody test. The test was offered by the AIDS Assessment Clinic and the Seattle Gay Clinic. The Puget Sound Blood Center, in conjunction with the Public Health Department, be-came a leader in developing blood screening policies. Responding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 23 The AIDS Prevention Project Fear of being tested Ann Downer, interviewed by Michael Brown: Well, this was before AIDS treatment and I think just like the fear reaction to AIDS, people had a lot of differ- ent reactions to testing. One of them was why get test- ed if there's nothing you can do about it? Which of course was misinformation, there are always things you can do when you have knowledge. But I think people thought it was fruitless to be tested. Another big fear, and I think a legitimate fear for people who are already really stigmatized like gay men or drug users or African Americans, is what are you going to do with the infor- mation and how might that be used against me? Peo-ple had a lot of legitimate fears around that, I think re lated to insurance, like would they then be denied health care benefits or even life insurance? Like any fear, it tends to lock onto whatever is personally relevant for you. MB: So you weren't just dealing with how is this virus transmitted, it was also \"if I go to public health and get tested and it's positive, where does that information go?\" You had to educate about those kinds of things as well? AD: Yeah, and test results are physical results and they are recorded. And information, as we know today all these years later, you can't always protect it completely. So yeah, people had legitimate fears. And then again, it's difficult to remember just how much stigma and fear there was around HIV back then. People fearing that others would find out they're positive. And then if you're positive, you have a responsibility to tell your partners, and whoever te aches those skills? So people were pretty much at the mercy of something new and frightening, and were already stigmatized in many cases by their sexu- al orientation. Controversy around testing When the HIV test became available, medical treatment was limited. People debated testing's po- tential benefits and risks. KING COUNTY ARCHIVES Frustration in the early years Hunter Handsfield: Early on, running an AIDS prevention program was a very frustrating business; unlike sexually transmitted diseas- es, tuberculosis, vaccine preventable diseases and so on, we had this new syndrome which we couldn't do much about at a biological and clinical level. We had no drugs, we weren't sure initially of diagnosis, the blood tests that became available initially, we were not sure how to interpret them, then we did know how to interpret them - so we could test people, we could determine that they were or were not infe cted, we could counsel them about how they can reduce their risk of being infected if they weren't, or to reduce transmission if they were - all that was we now know profoundly ineffective, we were spinning our wheels, because we didn't have a drug to treat. We didn't have an ability, we didn't have a va ccine, we didn't have any ability to intervene except to help people cope if they were frightened, we could try to do that. That was less a public health department role - once someone was diagnosed, they weren't continui ng to come to us, the public health department clinics and so on, so we ran what we called an AIDS a ssessment clinic, but it was only assessment. It wasn't treatment, it wasn't therapy. And there was a lot of controversy as to whether the counseling, interviewing, advising people what most of them intuitively knew anyway was not a very satisfying exercise. Should you or shouldn't you? Tim Burak interviewed by Michael Brown: ...and now that a test was available, a lot of controve rsy about the test. What are the steps that you take when you decide to be tested or not? So a lot of that got played out on the hotline. MB: Could you say a bit about that? The anxiety around testing and the issues? TB: Well, here's a test that's being piloted - I think it's being accepted as pretty accurate, it shows that people are infected by this virus that's been identified as the cause of eventually, of AIDS. But if you take the test and you test positive, so what? Because we didn't have anything we could do to treat people. We could help them get them fur-ther evaluation, we could help them get into a system where if they tested positive and they were showing early signs of illness, like something that could be pneumonia or this skin cancer, but could we treat it? Not really. We could do some preventive care around that pneumonia, pneumo- cystis pneumonia, it was called. Responding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 24 KING COUNTY ARCHIVES In favor of testing Robert Wood: So it made sense right off the bat to me that once we had the ability to distinguish people who really had this infection from those who didn't, we should encourage pe ople to get tested, even though we knew that was going to be frightening for them. We didn't have a treatment, really, for HIV. We did have treatments for some of the other diseases, and we very early on learned that we could prevent some of those diseases. So knowing that somebody was infected could potentially have a big impact of two or three years on keeping somebody well and then before they would develop side pneumocystis. So that was one argument for testing people. Another argument was that if people knew they had HIV infection they would very likely not want to transmit it to anybody else, and there was a major controversy there because we were not just inferring, we were actual-ly saying if you know you have HIV, you should tell other people you have HIV. But that was not palatable to a lot of people in the early days, because it was scary to dis- close that you had HIV. It might get further than that one person that you told, and people might lose employment or housing, and end up out on the street or something of that sort. So testing was very controversial. In the very early days Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York City, the main AIDS or- ganization there, was opposed to testing. They said what have you got to - what's the value of it? All it's going to do is frighten you and there's no trea tment for it. Why should you be tested? On the other hand, those of us in medicine, it made all the sense in the world to test so that we could know who to worry about and whom to put on prophylactic treat- ment, and so on and so forth. So yeah, great good news - we had this test, but a lot of people were afraid because they thought well, all right, sure, I'll go take this test, bu t now that I'm positive, what does that mean? Am I going to die? What can I do? Doesn't sound like I can do much, doesn't sound lik e they can offer us very much. There was also the fear that taking the test and somewhere having a record that you were testing positive would put you at un- known risk for who knows what, whether it was job discri mination, whether it was having your neighbors want to kick you out or whatever. So there was a whole lot of fear about the ramifications of taking the test. At the gay clinic we had a lot of debate about the value of taki ng that test in the early first year, especially, and we wrote up a position paper that we pu blished in the Seattle Gay News, should you or shouldn't you take the test? Giving what we thought were the pros and cons of taking this pretty controversial test. The Public Health Department's line was it wanted to encourage people to take the test because that could lead to get-ting them into care earlier, even though the care might not be - certainly not a cure, but care that was going to make people better. There was more skepticism among the gay community and among the volunteers at the clinic about pushing the te st, so we didn't want to push people or give the impression that we were push- ing people into taking the test, because our clients at th e gay clinic were coming to us, many of them having experienced pretty severe discrimination in their lives, and were wary of opening themselves up to some whole other level of discrimination. Responding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 25 KING COUNTY ARCHIVESFederal funding The federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC), impressed with both Seat- tle-King County's ability to obtain local public funding for AIDS work and its col-laboration with community groups, awarded the Pub- lic Health Department one of the first AIDS Preven-tion Demonstration Pro-ject Grants in the United States, along with Dallas, Denver, Long Beach and New York.

[1825-1-11] The grant of $365,000 developed model programs: AIDS education for the general public and prevention and control projects among one of the groups of King County citizens at highest risk: men who had sex with men (by far the largest group.) The grant also provided coordination and support for community- based AIDS services, such as the medical resource s program of the Northwest AIDS Foundation. A sec- ond CDC grant of $70,000 funded epidemiological work. The Seattle-King County Department of Public Health had made the decision to assume the lead role in applying for and allocating outside funding for local programs. External funding for surveillance, preven- tion, public education, and support for persons with AIDS would all come through Public Health, with part-ner organizations as subcontractors. Public Health's leadership assured that there were no conflicting proposals nor duplication of services. Responding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 26 KING COUNTY ARCHIVESThe AIDS Prevention Project The grant allowed the Public Health Department to expand its AIDS Pro-gram into a more consolidated and independent unit: the AIDS Preven- tion Project (APP). Responding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 27 The project originally had a staff of thirteen: a medical di-rector, a project coordinator, an epidemiologist, a health educa- tor, two information/outreach specialists, two nurse-practitioners, two health advi-sors (counselors), and a front office staff of three.

[1825-9-2] KING COUNTY ARCHIVES Robert Wood: I marketed my practice as it opened up to the LGBT because I was a gay phy- sician, and I was sort of an academic physician, already on the faculty at the U and helping to teach interns and residents. And I had some epidemiology skills, and I got involved in taking care of some people with AIDS through the gay physicians group, and basically when the Health Department decided they needed a health officer for HIV-AIDS, Hunter approached me and asked if I might be interested. I remember we had dinner one night up at Char- lie's, which is about to close, up on Capital Hill. And I got thinking about it and ultimately decided it was a good match for me. It was a particularly good match for me becaus e in May of '85, I dis- covered that I tested positive for HIV, and so I got thinking that this would be a good way maybe to make a contribution before my life ended. And it has yet to do that. Flier advertising the APP's new location and ex- tended hours.

That's where the health depart- ment was in those days. And so I became charged with look-ing for an alternative place for the HIV AIDS program to oper-ate that wouldn't be so identified as a government in stitution, and so when I we nt on a search that was kind of a strange adventure, because that was still - this is 1985, but there was still a lot of fear in the community, and real estate brokers and landlords and la ndladies had lots of fear about the potential of renting space to an AIDS clinic, as they would think of it. This was when we were first offering HIV testing and we wanted to offer it in some alternative site, so I went looking and eventually found a space on First Hill th at was close enough to Capital Hill that we felt it would be gay friendly. But I endured some pretty nasty treatment from real estate agents who either did- n't want to deal with anything having to do with AI DS or in one case, this woman drove me out to a site that's long gone, but it was basically a brick bunker covered with blackberry bushes, and she said, \"Well, there's maybe a good place for you,\" and she laughed. You know, people got away with that kind of treat-ment in those days. But I stuck with it and we fi nally found a place on First Hill, and the landlord there was - well, he knew what his interests were, but he was also willing to consider - after he met with me, he said, \"I went and I talked to some of my doctor friends, and they told me this AIDS thing is going to be around for a while. So I think it probably wouldn't hurt if I established some kind of relationship with you and let you rent some space.\" So he let us rent half of his building, which had been a vocational training school up on Summit Avenue, and that's where we established the AIDS Prevention Project as its own entity, physically separate from other health depart ment buildings. Because in those days we kind of wanted to do that. Nowadays everything is mainstreamed. HIV testing and services are offered at all the health department clinics throughout King County, but in those days, it was a different story and most folks just did not want to have something with AIDS in its name in heir neighborhood or in their building. A Place in the Community Turned away by many potential landlords, in Ju ne, 1986, the AIDS Prevention Project finally moved into its new home on Seattle's First Hill at 1116 Summit Avenue. KING COUNTY ARCHIVESThe saddest time Ann Downer: I think in many ways it was the saddest time of my life. It was exciting to be learning something new and to help other people learn, but it was before treatment and that was a particular time everybody remembers. APP staff formed a close-knit unit. In addition to the daily challenge of assessing, testing, and counseling people who might be diagnosed with AIDS or found to be HIV posi- tive, over the years, some staff members, community partners, and friends would also become ill with AIDS and pass away. In 1992 the APP moved to a new locaon in Seale's Belltown neighborhood.

One of the rst (1986) and largest studies was called \"Be a Star.\" It was a longitudinal study\u2014a study in which data is collected about the same group of individuals over a span of me. The APP developed a way that subjects, gay and bisexual men, could parcipate anonymously. Anonymity was important for those who were concerned that government agenci es might not keep their informaon con denal and who did not want friends or employers to nd out that they idened as gay or that they mi ght be HIVposive. Being a Star while remaining anonymous The APP's innovative solution to ensuring anonymity was to organize participants into six groups, each named for a \"camp\" cultural icon. Every six months the men were reminded through public advertisements that it was time for their assigned \"star\" group to return to the APP for follow-up interviews and optional HIV testing. With these public notifications, there was no need for APP staff to directly contact participants. In addition to notification through public advertising, participants received wallet-sized reminder cards like the one shown below to help them remember when to return for their follow-up visit. Each participant was also assigned a unique code that APP used to track that individual's data over time without the records being associated with a name. By the time the study ended in 1992, 2,676 men had participated. Initial data from the study helped the APP target its programming and improve counseling services.

[1825-6-5] Personal and profound Frank Chaffee: Well, a typical day was mostly direct face to face, one client after another. And we had one hour visits at the time. That was because many of them were part of this longitudinal study where we had an interviewer administered questionnaire, and it was a long questionnaire where we asked a lot about sexual behavior and attitudes and things like that. So I would come in and I'd grab the chart out of the pending chart file, call a client from the waiting room, take them ba ck to my office, we'd sit down and we'd have this hour inte raction where we would talk ab out really personal and sometimes profound things with a complete stranger. We were predominantly enrolling people on an anonymous basis so that they were creating a code. I didn't know the name of the person or how to get in touch with them. We had a clever system to get people to try to get people to remember to return every six months. And it quic kly became clear that when you talk to somebody about sex, all sorts of other things come into the mix. There's a tenden cy when you think of sexually transmitted infections from a biological perspective that there are bugs that go from Person A to Person B, and you got to figure out how to either treat them or prevent them from going from Person A to Person B. And it quickly becomes clear that yes, people put Part A into Slot B and they have sex, but it comes packaged (laughs) in all this other stuff around emot ions and cultural expectations and family expectations and personal views about the future and their se lf worth and the worth of their partners. It's just all this complicated stuff that gets attached to also this biological act. So there' s a tendency initially in public health, in public health communicable disease, to think from the perspectiv e of the disease causing entity. It gets from Person A to P e r s o n B , h o w c a n w e i n t e r r u p t t h a t s o w e c a n k e e p t h e p o p u l a t i o n s a f e ? A n d s o o u r u s u a l t o o l s a r e v a c c i n e s a n d treatments and we didn't have either of those with HIV. In the course of saying okay, we'll at least make you aware whether you've got it or not and hope that you'll behave resp onsibly if you do, all this other stuff started coming up. Because the stakes were so high.

By 1988, APP research included blind tesng of blood samples at blood banks and hospitals to measure the prevalence of AIDS in the general populaon; surveys of knowledge and atudes among students in response to AIDS curri cula; research on the cost of AIDS care; validaon of the completeness of AIDS case repor ng; and studies on the eecveness of counseling intravenous drug users in prevenon methods; among other subjects. Epidemiological research Sharon Hopkins interviewed by Lawrence Knopp: So we had a small group to start with, like 5-7 people at the beginning, and myself, I was one of the later additions after those folks. But eventually we g r e w i n t o a u n i t a t o n e p o i n t doing different forms of more intense research, not just surveillance, of 60 people, so at one time I think there were 60 of us working in the epidemiology surveillance research part of things. It had a small start and then really built up, and there were quite a bit of funds availa ble, primarily fr om the Centers for Disease Control to do spin-off studies that did things like looked at the medical records of people diagnosed with AIDS, and to see what their natural history was - what diseases did they get, what treatments did they get, how sick were they during the course of their illness? We called that the spectrum of disease study. That was on e of the first studies that sort of adde d on to the surveillance system, funded by the Centers for Disease Control. That's still going on in some different - it's been renamed obviously a number of times, and reformatted. Later we did an interview study of people with HIV AIDS , to find out more about their needs - what kind of treatments, what the barriers were to treatment, how they were doing, etc., and that was called SHAS - Supplemental HIV/AIDS System, I think it was. These names are coming out of my distan t memory here. A later study looking at whether the HIV virus was becoming resistant to antiretrovirals, that was an important study, resistance is always a concern. So yeah, there were others. Some of them were related to evaluating the surveillance system - how well was the surve illance system working. In fact, I think we were the first area here to sort of identify and call to the a ttention of the Center s for Disease Control that people were no longer being diag nosed primarily in the hospital with AIDS, they were getting diagnosed as outpatients, and that trend hadn't been apparent and it really affects the surveillance system. Because initially, hospitals were doing all the reporting of cases. So we kind of wrote a paper ab out that, called that to the attention of the CDC, they made some changes to do more outreach into outpatient settings to make sure the case reporting was coming in as complete as possible. So there were things like that we were evaluating. We were looking at the survival, how long were people living af ter their diagnosis, and we documented increasing links of survival, which was very gratifying to see. LK: So much if not most of this was actually more systems analysis, social scientific than biomedical? SH: Yes, here at public health. That's public health's role. KING COUNTY ARCHIVESEducation campaigns Much work under the Centers for Disease Control grant centered on reducing risk-taking behaviors among high-risk groups through clinical and peer counseling, through testing, and especially through education. Education was carried out through the telephone hotline; a Speakers' Bureau to respond to hundreds of community requests for up-to-date AIDS information; flyers and brochures; media spots an d advertisements containing risk- reduction messages and news of avai lable services; and model school curriculum materials. Ask Dr. Bob One form of targeted education was \"Ask Dr. Bob,\" an ad vice column by APP Medical Director Dr. Robert Wood, which appeared in the Seattle Gay News . In the column, Wood responded to readers' questions about safe sex practices and other AIDS-related issues. Letter to Dr. Bob and text of response published in the Seattle Gay News , 1989.

[1825-2-13] Ask Dr. Bob Robert Wood: Well, there was an obvious n eed to talk, particularly to the gay community, about their ri sk for HIV-AIDS and specifically what we knew and thought was likely in terms of how people were getting at and what kinds of steps they needed to take in order to prevent it. So it was part of my original plan for how to do comprehensive AIDS control was to have a series of articles that targeted the MSM community and told them in explicit and helpful ways, attractive ways, catchy ways if I could, all about HIV-AIDS and try to get their interest and cooperation essentially.

In 1986, the Public Health Department helped su pport the Northwest AIDS Foundation's \"Please Be Safe\" campaign, using a road-sign theme, urging people to practice safer sex. Fear and stigma in the workplace AIDS education also happened face-to-face. APP edu- cators visited groups who wanted to learn more about AIDS, including work-sites where employees feared contracting AIDS from their co-workers. Fighting AIDS discrimination at work In late 1987, King County Executive Tim Hill issued an executive order, the King County Employee AIDS Protocol, prohibiting discrimination against King County employees with AIDS or the AIDS virus. It also required accommoda- tion for County employees who were ill with AIDS, as was the law for other disabilities.

[1861-4-4] Public understanding Ann Downer: I think gay men were pret- ty aware of the situation by then, but the public was not. They knew something was there, but it was so early - it's hard to even imagine now, but peop le still thought it was transmitted casually through proximi-ty to others, sharing plates and utensils and things like. People really did believe that back then. I learned a lot about AIDS fast and then went out and spoke to groups like Rotary - all the animal clubs (laughs), the Lions and the Elks and all those groups. Because people were aware it existed then, and many people I think knew that they had misinformation.

[Image courtesy of the National Library of Medicine Item A025195] KING COUNTY ARCHIVESWork site visits Karen Hartfield: Businesses would call us and say \"there's a person with AIDS in our workplace and everybody is freaking out, no one wants to drink from the water fountain.\" This really happened. It was pretty interesting. I can remember several times I would go out, and my job was to talk to managers about what happens when you have a person with AIDS in the workplace, and calm everybody down. It really was very rewarding work, because once you talked to people about it, you could just see them visibly relax. There were so many myths about it and there was so much discrimination and homophobia out there, it really required a sort of one on one or one in a group contact. MB: Can you give some examples? KH: Sure, a couple of them. One - King County decided that every work unit or I can't remember, every department? I don't know, something - we had to go out to every part of King County employees and talk to them about HIV. So people would ask questions like, \"Are you going to have different bathrooms for these people? Are we allowed to know these people - \" and th ey're always like \"these people\" - \"are in our workplace?\" Very, questions that so unded so uninformed. You would answer them, and people would be like - oh. And then sometimes people would volunteer that someone in their family had AIDS, or some thing that would sort of help - it's like, \"Really? Your brother has it?\" That kind of thing. I remember one instance where I went out to Burlington Railroad - the only reason I remember this is because two things, one, I was pregnant, and they were just shocked that somebody who was pregnant woul d be around people with AIDS. It was like no, it's really fine. But the second re ason I remember is because they gave me a railroad hat (laughter), those funny striped hats. Anyway, they brought me out there because someone had come down with AIDS in the workplace and the employees wanted that person to not be allowed to work there anymore, so I went out and did the education and explained to them abou t how they could be supportive of their coworker but how they also didn't need to be afraid of their coworker. Responding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 36 KING COUNTY ARCHIVESSupporting health care providers Robert Wood and Tim Burak: TB: ... because the Health Department didn't really provide direct medical care to people with AIDS - that's not really been the role of the Pub- lic Health Department. There were some other activities that were going on. I think you men-tioned that Dr. Wayne McCormick early on start- ed doing some work looking at care patterns. Do you recall Wayne's work? Wayne, who's now gone on to become a national expert in end of life care and gerontology, gave a good deal of volunteer time to the project in those years. RW: Right. We were worried that the care system might be overwhelmed by the number of cases - I guess we're transitioning now into the care discussion. In the very early days some people had insurance and would go to wh atever doctors they'd been going to and a fair number of people didn't have any insurance. Certainly the IV drug users didn't tend to have any health care insurance, and Harborview would generally be the place as the public hospital where they would get care. And we we re quite concerned that if people went to a private provider with insurance and said \"I'm gay and I think maybe I have AIDS,\" that pri- vate provider might very well say \"gee, I don't know anything about HIV-AIDS and I'm not go- i n g t o b e a b l e t o t a k e c a r e o f y o u - m a y b e y o u s h o u l d g o t o H a r b o r v i e w \" o r \" m a y b e y o u should go to Dr. Wood.\" Because actually in '82, I was beginning to take care of people with HIV and AIDS. RW: It was going out and meeting with docs, an d making sure that they knew that they could take care of people with HIV-AIDS if they were interested and we would provide them some education about how to do that. We wo uld tell people about safety precautions, mak- ing sure that needles didn't get shared in any practices, talking about infection control pre-cautions as well in their practice. And then being available - I think both Wayne and I were available to docs out in the community if they wanted to call and ask questions. We also worked with the University of Washington's he lp line, they had a statewide help line, so the University of Washington was occasionally up dating materials that they had and we would help them update materials around HIV-AIDS and make sure that providers had all the re- sources and support that they needed to be able to provide care. Responding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 37 Training for health care providers Public Health identified and reached out to private doctors who were willing to accept AIDS patients and provided training on safety precautions and how best to treat unfamiliar AIDS-related illnesses. Public Health also coordinated the sharing of clinic al information so that doctors in private practice and those at Harborview (the local public hospital specializing in AIDS treatment), could learn from one another's observations.

Bridging the Housing Gap helped establish the need for housing for people with AIDS, separate from already existing facilities. Series 872- King County documents collection [872-735] Housing The Northwest AIDS Foundation had approached King County in 1985 to help with housing for people with AIDS. In 1986, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awarded King County a planning study grant to look at housing disadvantaged de-mographic groups, including people with AIDS. Public Health hired local AIDS activist Betsy Lieberman, whose research demonstrated the need to fund specialized residential care facilities for AIDS victims. With the opening of Bailey-Boushay House in 1992, King County became a model in compassionate end-of- life housing and care for AIDS pa- tients. Listen to stories of people who have lived at BaileyBoushay House, the rst housing facility specially designed for people with AIDS, on the Bailey Boushay Web site (hp:// www.bailey boushay.org/ storycorps) Starting in the 1980s, the academic and clinical research communities used a collective term to describe one of the principal risk groups: men who have sex with men (MSM; sometimes ngi-MSM or MWM). This term was viewed as more clinically accurate, as it includ ed men who had same-sex partners but did not personally identify as gay. The abbreviations may also have reassured people who were uncomfortable using the word, \"gay.\" Some gay men, how- ever, objected to the use of \"MSM,\" saying that it reduced on e's identity to only a sexual act. In Seattle in the 1990s, an MSM Task Force reorganized as the Gay Men' s AIDS Prevention Task Force, or GayMAP Graphic from the 1995 MSM retreat schedule, by \"Stella Seattle\" artist Dominic Capello. KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 39 Expanding Outreach The People of Color Against AIDS Network The People of Color Against AIDS Network (POCAAN), a Seattle- based, multi-racial community c oalition, provided HIV/AIDS edu- cation and training aimed at Latino, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander and Native American communities. King County's administrative director for AIDS programs, Patricia McInturff (formerly Patricia Canov a), saw that the AIDS epidemic would not spare communities of color. She supported POCAAN's principles and committed the Public Health Department to work- ing closely and often with the group. In one early collaborative project, POCAAN, using seed money from the AIDS Prevention Project, created the 1988 \"Famous Last Words\" educational cam- paign to increase awareness of AIDS among people of color. \"POCAAN's coalition building effort is to bring people together across color, gender, sexual orientation, agency affiliation and community lines. POCAAN provides a forum for dispelling myths and fears, and for ena-bling people of color to work together in unity....We must confront the effects of the isolation caused by homophobia in commu-n i t i e s o f c o l o r , a n d b y t h e r a c i s m o f t h e gay/lesbian community.\" \u2014 from POCAAN's mission statement Right and below: Poster and brochures from the \"Famous Last Words\" se-ries, published by POCAAN with support from Public Health.

[1825-3-16, 1825-3-20] Political clout Patricia McInturff: The only thing that I used to worry abou t during the ten years there was that the leadership in the impacted community was so smart, so good - knew who to touch and how to touch them - that I knew the disease would even tually move into other populations that didn't have that kind of political clout, that didn't have that kind of know-how, to know how to get to the governor's office or the mayor's office. KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 40 One of our earliest campaigns was called - the tagline was \"AIDS is a white man's disease - famous last words.\" At the time people were so interested in AIDS, it was such a sexy topic. So ad agencies would practically be lining up to do pro bono work for us at that time. Not so much anymore. So we had McCann Erickson which is a really big huge ad agency, it's a national company, and they devel- oped that message, \"AIDS is a white man's disease.\" It looked like it was on a blackboard. I don't know if you have any of those posters. So it was in white like the background is black. It said \"AIDS is a white man's Disease\" like someone wrote it on a blackboard. And then in red it said \"Famous last words.\" And that was a campaign where we were trying to get the African American community to understand this was not a white man's disease. So that was a really big campaign we did early on. We had TV, PSA's, we had billboards all over the place. So that was again targ eting a bigger community where you don't do quite as much targeted work. But then we also worked with them on various targeted campaigns. The other thing they did which was very helpful for public health is they did a lot of community organizing and community building. So they would get the black community together and they would be the messenger for \"this is re-ally important, and could you put th ese brochures in your grocery store?\" or \"could you have like a box of condoms around\" or that kind of thing. So we worked very closely but we really ceded a lot of the responsi- bility to them. POCAAN campaigns Karen Hartfield interviewed by Michael Brown: So, I was actually a founding board member of POCAAN before - MB: When was that? KH: Probably when I was working at the Urban League, like '86-87. It was a great sort of in, when I started this job at Public Health, because I already knew all of them. What we did was we contracted with POCAAN to do a number of campaigns. AIDS News comic book published by POCAAN in 1988 and the storyboard for the comic.

The grant expanded the program to tar-get hard-to-reach populations, including street youth and sex industry workers. The candid personal stories used by outreach programs such as Street Kids AIDS Training and Education (SKATE) and Girlfriends Talking reflected the reality of people's lives. Street Kids AIDS Training & Education With funding from Public Health, POCAAN produced a series of posters that shared stories from homeless youth learning to adopt condom use and other STD pre-vention strategies. People in danger Karen Hartfield: One was men who have sex with men who do not identify as gay or bisexual, and that was based on a fear at the time that HIV was going to spread far beyond the population of self- identified gay men, there was acknowledgement that there were men who were living in heterosexu- al marriages or relationships but having sex with men on the side, that was one population. Then there were women in the sex industry, women who trade sex for either money or drugs. Usually, I would have to say, it was either drugs or money to buy drugs. Almost all of the sex industry work was connected to drugs, it wasn't like a choice. Like the \"Pretty Woman\" movie came out I think around then. It was like - no (laughs), that's not really how it is. And then other population was homeless or street youth, because they were at risk, because they were again maybe trading sex for a place to stay, or looking for affection from an adult because they had been kicked out of their homes, and that sort of thing. And then also we focused on gay men who use methamphetamines which continues to be the highest risk population for HIV, even now. That was a population that was much more sort of underground and harder to reach. And then we focused on gay men who identified as gay, but who were cont inuing to have risk behavior.

KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 43 Seeing the impact in the community Karen Hartfield: I was mostly dealing with the African- American community at the time, and there was almost no perception that it could impact the community at all. There was obviously concern, because at the time it was a fatal disease and we didn't even know anything about it or what caused it, but it was clearly, in the eyes of the community it was a gay community, a gay problem. Espe-cially then, I think that a lot of gay men, African-American gay men were not out to their families, so it was sort of like this is a white problem too. So overcoming all of those obstacles was challenging. And in addition of course parents would prefer not to even think about their children being sexually active anyway, so there were many, many barriers to getting the community to sort of own this as something that might be impacting them. Barriers to AIDS Education Gay stigma Robert Wood:interviewed by David Reyes I think there's probably more stigma still around HIV than there is around Hepatitis C just because it's sort of more sexual and gay-related. It's interesting that people sort of knee-jerk, thinking about stigma, they think about HI V, but what has become more clear to me over the last ten years or so is that it's the stigma around HIV actually that - not HIV, but the stigma around being gay that I think is contributing to HIV spread, partic ularly in the African American and Hispanic communi- ties. It's very difficult for minority people to own up to being gay, and so they tend to be tested later or not at all, and therefore potentially have the opportunity to transmit more. I've be en working with the commu- nity action board of the Center for AIDS Research a little bit, Jasani Henry and some other folks have been doing it more than I, to try to get the community ac tion board to address gay stigma as a way of doing HIV prevention in the racial minority communities. We have Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays is a fairly good group at the national level and several local levels. I've spoken with groups here in Seattle and over in Bellevue, but there are no Parents and Friend s of Lesbians and Gays within the black community or in the Hispanic community that I know of, and it 's such a hard stigma in the black community where religion is such a driving force for them, for people to be openly gay and to be accepted within their com- munity. So my sense is that if we could get mino rity communities more accepting of homosexuality, it would actually do a lot to decrease the possible ongo-ing transmission of HIV in that population. So that's a need that continues. It would be great to have a good community action board to do that, but now AIDS is such a chronic disease (laughs). DR: Right, so again, how do you create that sense of urgency to bring mome ntum and energy to - RW: It should be urgent in the black community because it's so inordinately hit by it. They should see that as urgent, but it's a very stigmatized problem and it's actually I think the stig ma of homosexuality is more damaging than the stigma of GHIV in many ways. I don't know how to address that, but I think the Su- preme Court's decision to allow gay people the right to marry will ultimately help to move people in the direction of more normalization...

[1825-14-1] KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 45 Needle Exchanges Sharing Needles By 1991, injection drug users accounted for over 25 percent of AIDS cases nationwide. The figure was far lower in King County: three percent, with an-other nine percent among gay or bisexual men who were also injection drug users. But with an estimated 12,000 to 14,000 intravenous drug us- ers in King County, over 80 per- cent of whom shared needles, the risk of AIDS spreading in this community was great. Shar- ing needles put not only users at risk, but it also risked infect-ing their sexual partners, as well as the fetuses of pregnant partners. The Public Health Department's first strategy was educating us-ers about the risks and distrib- uting bleach to sterilize nee- dles. Successful needle exchange programs abroad and at home Needle exchanges originated in Europe, Canada, an d Australia around 1984 as a means to minimize the risk of HIV and Hepatitis B transmi ssion among people unable or unwilli ng to cease injection drug use. New sterile syringes were exchanged for old contam inated ones. Needle sharing and reuse were more likely in states like Washington, where state law prev ented the purchase of syringes without a prescrip- tion. In the United States, the first publicly funded needle exchange was established in Tacoma in 1988. Early efforts at fighting the spread of HIV among injection drug users discouraged need le sharing and encouraged people to use bleach to clean syringes. Series 1825 - History files, Seattle-King County Department of Public Health: Prevention Division / HIV-AIDS Program. [1825-5] KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 46 Patricia McInturff interviewed by Lawrence Knopp: Tacoma actually started the first needle exchange. Which was embarrassing to Seattle, because we always thought we were way out ahead of everyone else. There was not a lot of political support for it. LK: Not a lot of political support in Tacoma? PM: No, in Seattle to do it. LK: Oh, you mean to do it in Seattle. PM: To do the needle exchange. And there's some folks in ACT UP who I happen to know, who said you know, we're going to em- barrass the hell out of you, and I said great (laughs), if you need some needles, let me know and we'll get them for you. So they sort of started it and then some of us went to the electeds and said now, don't you think it would be bett er if we public health people were running this? We want to do this from a public health per- spective. We just don't want to hand out needles, we want to con- nect people with services and care and yada yada. So we sort of then took it over. But even after it had been there several years, we would continue to get pushback during the Rice administration - move it inside, don't leave it on a corner. LK: Where did that pushback come from? PM: Business, the businesses down there. We used to say two things - one is, we're not attracting people to your neighborhood. These are not people who have what we call health seeking beha vior, they're not going to walk three blocks for needles. We're there because they 're there first, we're not attracting anybody, this is where these people are. And second, you start putting it inside a building - people get nervous. Do I want that door to shut? Am I inside? Is there a cop around? I think it finally did move inside years later, but we wanted it outside, so you could come and go as fast as you could. I think that's the only time I ever got into a big poli- cy dispute. Because the head of the Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Division of the health department, my peer ran that, and they traditionally had come from an A.A. background. I found out, much to my surprise, that my colleague had written a position paper against needle exchange and had got it to the County Execu- tive. Well, it looks pretty bad in one department when the county executive is getting two papers, and I was furious. And he eventually, I believe, had to withdraw that, but that's the only - that's where I got the real pushback, because they felt it was enab ling, they really didn't believe in wh at we call the risk reduction model, they really thought abstinence was wh at we should - the AA model is the mo del that we should be presenting. So my biggest flap came from inside my own department. * * * I remember Tim Hill at the time who wa s a Republican said, \"I don't like it,\" but when you showed him the data about how it was exploding, and IV drug abusers in other cities - HIV just exploded in some cities - he said, \"I'll support you on it because I think it's ri ght thing to do. I don't like it.\" LK: By this time was he County Ex ec or was he a county councilman? PM: He was county exec. And then when we expanded it to go out in the county, I think we went to White Center first, that was Greg Nickels's area. I know one night I was sending one of my staffers out to be just eat- en alive by the community out there who was really unhappy about us. I got called over to Greg Nickels's office by his aide at the time, Tim Ceis who became the deputy mayor, and basically they said a couple of things to me. One is, do you want Tim to go with your staff member? And two, we don't care how much they yell, we'll back you. We won't change our minds on this. I can reme mber that I never forgot that from Greg Nickels - \"I don't care what the community says, I'll support you, so don't be afraid if the noise gets loud.\" LK: Was that the result of some carefu l groundwork or was that just his - PM: Well, I think he'd been on the Board of Health, I'm guessing, but he and Tim just said don't worry. We said fine, we'll go out and get shouted at and screamed at. Public, professional, and pol itical controversy KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 47 Harm reduction The idea of distributing free syringes was seen by some as encouraging drug use. But the harm reduc- t i o n a p p r o a c h t o p u b l i c h e a l t h a r g u e d t h a t e v e n when a person's behavior (in this case, drug use) doesn't change, the harmful impact of that behavior could, and should, be minimized. Reducing the harm of contracting HIV and spreading it to ot hers took priority over demanding abstinence. Even if you can't cure Gary Goldbaum: The way we've always done business is not necessarily the way we need to move forward. AIDS perhaps more than any disease brought to the fo refront the notion of harm reduction strategies. They are important tools, so syringe exchange was th e obvious example back then. Today we have other harm reduction strategies. We're still talking about inject ion drug use, it's a real epidemic - well, we'd love for everyone to no longer inject, but if they're going to inject, we want them to have clean syringes. We want them to have access to drugs that can reverse an overdose. Harm reduction strategies - that wasn't really part of our mantra 30 years ago. AIDS has said, you know something? Even if you can't cure, even if you can't adequately treat, you can reduce the ha rm. Always look for those opportunities. So those are examples of how it's really influenced me. I think perhaps the most important lesson of AIDS is that we mustn't forget what happens when you have a disease that can be highly stigmatizing and we need to always keep that in mind. For example, Ebola - well, did we observe overre-action to Ebola in this country? Governors who basically said you are going to be isolated, people who were the medi- cal volunteers going to Africa, forgetting that they need to really think about what's the be st science, how do we avoid stigmatizing, what strategies do we want in the community, how do we engage the community so that this isn't just gov-ernment's overreaction. I'd say that's the most important lesson I take away from the AIDS era. I also have learned subsequent to my experience working directly with AIDS, in my current role as director of a public health agency where I'm thinking about a lot of different conditions and where I actually have to think very holisti- cally about my agency and how it allocates its resources. One of the things we've observed wi th HIV and AIDS has been a transiti on from a time where resources to t a k e c a r e o f p e o p l e w e r e f r a n k l y n o t a v a i l a b l e a n d i t r e q u i r e d d e d i c a t i n g r e s o u r c e s . O t h e r s h a v e n o w learned from that experience - maybe we need dedicated resources for other conditions. That's been a powerful tool in the community. At the same time it has created a challenge, as we've moved away from an era where there weren't resources to take care of people, to an era now where we have the Affordable Care Act and health care transformation quite independently of the Affordable Care Act, but an opportunity for us to move in a new direction. This was not antici pated at the time. At the time AIDS was really appear- ing, the medical community did not want to have anything to do with people with AIDS - didn't want to take care of them, didn't feel that they had anything to offer, oftentimes it was af fecting folks who weren't KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 49 Seattle's own needle exchange bega n in March 1989, operated by the local branch of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP).

[1825-5] King County and the City of Seattle, convinced that the program was effective and had not led to an in- crease in drug use, continued funding the program and have done so to the present day. Seven years later, the Public Health Department could claim that its needle exchange program was \"probably the larg- est legal program in the country\" (Dr. Robert Wood, 1996), exchanging over a million needles in that year. KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 49 The needle exchange Robert Wood: ...we got programs off the bat going, targeting gay men, but by 1986-87 it was quite clear that we didn't have much yet for injec-tion drug users, and there were other programs and ideas that were emerging, not just nationally but even internationally. I think in '88 Hunter and I went to one of the last United States international AIDS meetings. Shortly after that, there were prohi-bitions on letting people with HIB into the country, and so the In- ternational AIDS Society decided they wouldn't have any more meetings in the United States. That was one of the Bush Presi-dent ideas and Congressional ideas. And so anyway, we went to this meeting in Washington, D.C. and we learned that in Holland they were beginning to do needle exchange programs and allowing to get people to get sterile inje ction equipment instead of forcing them essentially to use old dirty injection equipment. It made all the sense in the world, not just from the standpoint of not having people inject with filthy equipment that other people had used, but also from bringing people to us. We knew that injection drug users weren't people that would necessarily kind of throng into public health departments to be tested and to get education, and so duh (laughs), you know, why not attract them to us and provide them some services and education, first on the street but then ultimately in storefront settings. And that was clearly something we learned from people in other parts of the world. We came back from that meeting with this great idea as a way of kind of approaching the injection drug using population by providing some services to them and we bo th talked to Patricia who was our boss and said hey, let's do this. And she said I don't know whether - but Nicola and - who was the mayor at the time? I think it was Norm Rice, I don't know, might have been Charlie Roye r maybe. I think it was after Royer. And the county executive - I mean obviously the county council and the city council had to buy off on this. But AIDS was such a great lever, because it was so frightening and such a scary disease that I think a lot of people were willing to take risks around this disease that otherwise they wouldn't have been able to take if it had just been sort of an outbreak of tuberculosis or something like that. People were dying of this disease in a nasty way, and I think it frightened a lot of people into giving us chances and opportunities that they otherwise might not have been willing to do.

Be- cause of its sweeping scope, public health orientation , substantial civil rights protection, and statewide approach to providing AIDS care services, the Act was considered the most comprehensive and progres- sive statewide approach to AIDS policy in the United St ates at the time. It served as a model for legislation in other states. The Washington State AIDS Omnibus Act, signed on March 23, 1988. The law primarily amended RCW Chapter 70.24 \u2014 Control and Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases. Source: Washington State Revised Code of Washington Chapter 70.24. Expanding Education: Condoms in Schools The AIDS Omnibus Act required AIDS education in pu blic schools for grades 5 through 12. The Seattle- King County Department of Public Health, which had supported outreach programs to schools since the mid-1980s, now undertook new initiatives. In 1995, student focus groups at West Seattle High School provided feedback on this pamphlet, \"You Are Not Alone.\" As a result, Public Health decided to make several changes, in-cluding removing the image of the hairy palm in the up- per left, because the focus group did not understand the reference.

When Washington State's Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS recommended that condom use be included in AIDS education, the Department found itself in the middle of a public debate. Educational programs and ma terials provided detailed information to promote accurate understanding of condom use and STD prevention. Many saw these campaigns as encouraging teen sex. Some objected to teaching condom use in schools with the argument that condoms were ineffective in preventing HIV infec- tion. The Department challenged this view with a re- port distributed throughout the Seattle School District in 1992. 1992 report prepared for the Seattle School Dis- trict.

With other diseases, there had been less con- cern for protecting patient privacy. Practices such as reporting names to local and state health offices, forced testing, and notifying partners of an infected individual were standard. From the beginning of its response to AIDS, the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health had held firm that protecting patients' privacy was critical to an effective program. They argued that if people trusted the Department and its community partners, th ey would be more likely to get tested and engage in prevention efforts. The AIDS Omnibus Act created standard, statewide rules in an effort to balance civil rights and patient privacy with public health and safety. In practi ce, implementation could still prove challenging. New protections under the Act Gary Goldbaum: Government and community st arted to learn very new ways of working together. I'll give the example, the question of should there be mandatory testing. Another example would have been manda-tory reporting. So if someone gets teste d, they t est positive, for ev ery other sexually transmitted infection basically that information gets re- ported. If you test positive for gonorrhea, it must be reported to public health so that public health can do partner notification. Well, with HIV and the stigma associated with it, and real concerns by the community that this is going to lead to seriou s social problems, discrimination, loss of jobs - it was a very realistic co ncern. Of course anyone who looks back at the history, you can read th e news articles at the time and you see the obvious evidence of discrimination. So this notion - hey, stig-matization is a problem - it was very real. So the community was very reluctant for government to be doing business as usual, the notion of reporting of HIV testing - for example, just testing. With other sexually transmitted infections, someone went into a doctor's office and said \"Doctor, I've got a drip from the peni s, I'm a little worried.\" Doctor says, \"Could be gonorrhea, I'm going to do a te st.\" Does it, \"I'll call you in a few days .\" With HIV, there was real concern - I want to say if I'm going to be tested. I want this to be a clear conversation and I want to have the authority to say yea or nay to it. And it led to dramatic changes in the consent process. Never before had we required significant consent, which was actually prescribed by law now, fo r a medical test - just didn't exist. Even surgeries and such where we expected consent, at that time largely it was verbal and it was kind of informal. With HIV testing, this was a big deal. Because people were worried - if I'm iden tified as having HIV and AIDS, it can lead to this stigma. That's a problem. So we were learning government role vis-\u00e0-vis the community, we had to have these conversations. Reporting - another great one. We don't want there to be report ing and government reaching out, we're worried about these lists. Who's going to have access to it? Could someone misuse those lists to discrimi-nate, to prosecute, whatever - it led to real concerns and deep conversations about things like the behaviors endan- gering. So in the past if someone had a disease that could be infectious, public health could isolate an individual or quarantine those who'd been exposed. State law was change d to be very specific about the limitations on govern- ment, how it would proceed in cases where there were concerns about someone who's got HIV. As an example, this notion of a behavior endangering. So there had been a ve ry small number of cases in Washington prosecuted where someone was HIV infected, had unprotected sex without disclosing to partners, those partners became infected and lo and behold, they were concerned, how was it that I was neve r informed? This person was infecting others. It was a very difficult time for government agen cies to interact with the community because the community was still very wary - we don't want you stepping in, even at the same time as there were serious concerns, quite frankly, largely these be-haviors endangering involved women who were exposed by men, heterosexual contact. But the gay community was also very concerned - what are you going to do to us? If I have a partner who becomes infected, does this mean we're now going to be subject to legal harassment? It required a lot of negotiation and some open conversation, because law only goes so far - law is what's printed out. How it's implemented, that was what we started to deal wi th within the AIDS Prevention Project and the other local public health agencies.... KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 53 Balancing interests: mandatory testing Frank Chaffee: So in 1988 there was a big push to get some state money established as an ongoing fund for HIV prevention, it was called the AIDS Omnibus bill. So its initial impetus was - get a pot of money and then a second one was create some co- herent laws around this stuff that makes sense and then cre-ate a good prevention structure. People often forget that bill was only passed by one vote so it was a hard fought bill. TB: And it was called - FC: The vote? Oh, the AIDS Omnibus bill, yeah. One of the compromises that got slipped in there by folks who were sort of knee-jerk is that by God, we're going to get some man-datory testing in there. So there was mandatory testing of people convicted of sex crimes. And it was written very poor- ly and had all kinds of ambiguities and was a mess to administer. And then there was also a provision of mandatory testing for people who were the source of a blood exposure to a health care worker and at the time - because once again, there was nothing to be done for the health care worker, it seemed like an exer- cise that was kind of pandering to paranoia. If the he alth care worker was going to get exposed and actually get infected, the only way they could know that for certain is their own test. But in 1988 we thought that it routinely took six months from exposure to a positive test so you were dooming somebody to this six month period of worry. But it created this law that said okay, if you're a health care work er and you sustain a needle stick from a syringe that was contaminated by your pati ent, you get to ask the patient to test for HIV and dis- close those results to you so that you can figure out wh at your follow up is going to be. And if the patient says no, you can go to a health officer which is the public health officials and say I want you to make that per-son test for HIV. So for many years I was the screener for those cases in public health, and started that and came to know a lot of people who worked in the field called infection control that I had known about. And learned that partic-ularly in hospitals, if something can happen, it will happen and all kinds of bizarre accidents happen. I think the one that really changed my opinion was a health care worker who sustained a needle stick and she was two months preg- nant, and this was when it was still really scary around AIDS, and she was making a decision about whether or not to continue the pregnancy based on whether that patient was HIV positive or not. And that seemed to me to be a really ra-tional calculus for her to pursue, and that even if the patient said no, that her interests were great- er than the interests of a patient saying no be-cause we had a lot of protections in place for that information. It wasn 't like we were going to publish the patient's results on the front page of the paper. True, it was an imposition on the pa-tient's will. And in most cases we could just ex- plain that to a patient and they'd say sure, I un- derstand how you'd be worri ed, that's just fine. In 1991, the AIDS Prevention Project developed this bro- chure to help health care providers understand the how and when to report HIV and AI DS cases to public health officials.

KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 54 The Steven Farmer Case In 1987, the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office charged Seattle resident Steven Farmer with felony exploitation of a minor for taking in appropriate photographs of teenage male prosti- tutes. (The subjects were 16 and 17\u2014the age of sexual consent in Washington State. The state's exploitation law, however, protects individuals under 18.) The photos had been seized in what was found to be an illegal search, causing the charges to be reduced to a misdemeanor in a plea bargain. After receiving a tip and corrobora- tion from Farmer's acquaintances that Farmer had told them he was HIV-positive, prosecutors sought to increase his sentence, accusing him of deliberate endangerment. Farmer denied he was HIV-positive. Amidst an increasing public outcry, the court ordered that Farmer be tested for the virus without his con-sent. The results (positive) were pre-sented in open court by the head of the Public Health Department's STD Program, Dr. Hunter Handsfield, who appeared at the request of the pre- siding judge. The test in question was not per- formed by Seattle-King County Public Health nor by the AIDS Prevention Pro-ject. But the court-ordered disclosure of Farmer's HIV status by a Public Health official caused people to question whether the Department wa s protecting patient confidentiality. APP staff worked to rebuild trust and reassure critics that case records were indeed maintained in confi- dence. The State Supreme Court later found that the ju dge had acted outside his authority. In 1994, when he was dying of AIDS in jail, Farmer was granted clemency by Governor Mike Lowry. The case highlighted legal and civil rights questions around forced testing, rules for which were set out in the AIDS Omnibus ACT. The prosecution was seen by some as deliberately targeting Farmer amidst a wave of anti-gay/AIDS hysteria, with media coverage stoking the public's fear. Prosecutors held that the case was about protecti ng vulnerable minors from sexual exploitation and endangerment.

They're vulnera-ble, they live on the street, they don't have any sup-p o r t s y s t e m . Y o u k n o w , w h e n w e l o o k a t h u m a n trafficking issues today - when I look back at that time, at those boys, they didn't really have anything or anybody. So part of the concern was making sure they're protected in a ll respects, not just from HIV but from sexual assault or any kind of exploita-tion. We didn't have the kind of mindset back then...the sensitivity that we have today. I think our office had that, but I don't know if it was as wide-spread as it is today, where we embrace our vulner- able and try to make sure that they're protected. ....it was an important mome nt in history and it was one where you had concerns about public safety...where a judge found there should be a test com-pelled. Of course our system works when it goes all the way to the Supreme Court and they can say yea or nay, and they said that was exceeding authority. The thing is, our laws are always changed through the courts.... Our courts really have to handle some of these social, impactful issues. I think we had the first Special Assault Unit in the country in Seattle, and we had a long-term prosecu- tor that was extremely fair and principled, so if a case is to be tested anywhere on that issue, I think King County would be one of the best places, if not the best...to deal with the issue.\" Anne Bremner, Prosecutor in the Special Assault Unit of the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Of-fice 1983-1988.

The Seattle King County Department of Public Health ar gued that a softer touch worked better to keep people en- gaged and to fight HIV's spread. Debate over closing bath houses Gary Goldbaum: There were also the challenges about the places where in- fections could occur - bathhouses for example, that became a very chal- lenging topic, because the public health folks understood that the bathhous- es were probably sites where there wa s a lot of unprotected anonymous sex without much disclosure, if any, and th at might be a place where hey, if we shut them down, would that prevent a lot of the transmissions? Fortunately there was a lot of thoughtful conversation and dialogue, not only with that industry especially with the gay community - you know what? The fact is all you're going to do - it's like the ball oon - you're going to squeeze here and i t ' s g o i n g t o c o m e o u t h e r e . A n d a c t u a l l y w h a t w e n e e d t o d o i s t a k e a d - vantage of the opportunity to reach th e highest risk folks in the community by engaging them at those sites. This is a really different approach to public health. So public health went into the bathhouses, we offered testing, we offered the educational information, we tried to build relationships in those settings with both the owners of the ba thhouses for example, and with the c lientele there. But that required a long term investment of personnel who really built relationships. It also led to some new approaches to the kind of staffing we hired, because we understood as an example, it wasn't going to work as effectively to put a woman into a man's bathhouse, we'd need to have folks who were really comfortable with what goes on in a bathhouse. So you needed to hire predominantly from the community, but folks who really cared about the community, understood what the work was about. Again, these were extraordinary changes... Debate over mandatory testing Hunter Handsfield: But there were a lot of us who believed that a softer approach - make it voluntary, don't be so assertive with people that you frighten them aw ay - was the smarter way to go, and we were accused by people on the other side of the political spectrum or what I would say the populist rightist perspective, of cod-dling to this disadvantaged group, gay men's civil rights and personal concerns over the public's health, that the public health was secondary to protecting this disa dvantaged group. In fact I would posit with absolute confidence that our motivation was - what is going to maximize the number of people who get tested? And if hitting people over the head with a sledgehammer is go ing to reduce that, then why would you do it? What then happens is you now flash forwar d ten years, you get in the mid 1990s. Effective therapy's becoming available and now we can say we need to test you because we can now offer you treatment and that treat- ment will help you protecting others, and now we became advocates for more assertive testing, with still those residu al elements on the other side of this argument saying \"See? We told you all the time - we were right and you were wrong. We wanted to test more assertively, and now you've finally seen the light.\" No - we didn't see any goddamn lig ht at all. We saw the light from the start, and we still see it, and the issue is what is going to maximize access to knowledge of infection and treatment? And the social and medical and politi-cal context of the mid 1980s was unequivocally that a softer approach was going to maximize that. It shifted to a point where a more assertive approach was going to maximize it, but it wasn't because we were philosophically wrong then and saw the light, it was because of pragmatic - and public health peo- ple who run prevention control programs are almost with not exceptions the ultimate pragmatists. What's going to work is what they're going to do, and it was just a question of what's going to be most effective in achieving our long term goal of maximizing prevention. KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 57 AIDS activism's impact on the \"Ivory Tower\" Frank Chaffee: ...the camps of people who come to play in the arena called public health come from different perspectives and there's a kind of biological hard science camp that says well, we just need the data and we need to run frequencies and so we need to have good data before you can make any decisions about things. And then there's always been a kind of either nursing or social service camp that has come into the public health arena that would talk about social justice and you've got to be sure that you're doing things in a way that's culturally co mpetent, etc. Along comes AIDS with all of the fear of it, the huge consequences, death, no treatment, st igma of getting it through sex or drug use, and along comes a community group that says we're not going to let you, the government, treat these peo- ple like crap. And we're going to fight you every step of the way if you think you're going to put in poli- cies that aren't thoughtful and that will hurt people. So unlike any other communicable disease, a growing vocal constituency of people advocating for the folks who are affected by the disease made their pre sence known in what turned out to be very effec- tive ways. I often think that ACT UP would take po sition statements that I wouldn't necessarily agree with on public health grounds, that the fact that ACT UP staged a demonstration where they got on the roof of the NIH and closed it down for a day, scared the shit out of a bunch of these stodgy scientific bureaucrats. Nobody knew what to do with people who were calling them pigs and it wasn't civilized, \"that wasn't a group that I dealt with when I got my Ph .D.\" And it ripped open th e veil that what you're doing affects people in their guts, where they live, it has real consequences. You can't live in this ivory tower and think that you can make decisions and just ignore the ripple effects of those decisions. I think that happened first round AIS and has percolated through the health care system in a lot of ways since then. It was a real watershed. But it initially created fear and a lot of policy capitulations and okay, we'll set up special rules, that were eventually then characterized by the opposition as AIDS excep- tionalism. Let's come up with a nasty name for it, we'll call it AIDS exceptionalism and say you're really j u s t a f r a i d o f a l l t h e q u e e r s , a r e n ' t y o u . Y o u t h i n k you're being so politically correct that you don't want some fag calling you a fascist, that you'll compro-mise the public health so that you can create spe- cial rules that put the rest of us at risk. That was the kind of rhetoric of the extreme opposition and then you'd have people who would say I'm not upset with anybody, I'm just a rational scientist and you've of course gotta do these things. And then folks would say - yeah, weren't you from the group that said Tuskegee was an okay thing to do too? Maybe you don't have so much moral credibility after all. So a lot of people were calling out the unquestioned privilege of white men in positions of power in the medical establishment.

[1861-3-26] \"Behaviors endangering\" Frank Chaffee: ...there was another part of the AIDS Omnibus law that created this set of testing circumstances for situations that were called behaviors en- dangering the public health and that was basically a set of laws - well, what if somebody knows they have HIV and they want to spread it and hurt people? What are we going to do as a society to intervene in that case? Well, the first response should have been that happens with just infinitesimally small fre-quency. It just isn't something that happens a lot. But admittedly, if it hap-pens, when it happens, we didn't have a lot of laws that described what could we do to intervene to stop a person who was doing things to hurt other people. And so these laws came about and they were often written in a really clumsy way and they were vague and they had inflammatory language in them, and from my own experience, impossible to administer because they were so con-tradictory. So I was the one for many years who took the reports, usually from the medical community. \"Oh, I've got this patient who has HIV and his wife came in and it's really clear that he hasn't told her that he has HIV and they've got a baby at home and she might be pregnant and I can't tell her because of privacy laws but it looks like he's continuing to put her in harm's way - what are you going to do?\" So situations like that. And in most cases what we would do is play a form of good cop/bad cop where the reporting provider would report it to public health as wa s allowed by the AIDS Omnibus law, that meant it came to me, and that we would play out a kind of good cop/bad co p scenario with the patient and we would do everything we could to point out the problem of the situation to the patient and the need for transparency for the sake of the health of everyone involved. And we usually succeeded on those grounds. I think where the problems came is those situations are so morally outrageous to folks that they go to their outrage place and then stamp down - \"I can't believe you would do something that irresponsible! Wh at's wrong with that person? He should be shot!\" And then we'd come in and say well, you know, everybody's got a story (laughs), there's probably a lot going on. Let's see if we can pull this apart and get to an endp oint where everybody knows what's going on.

In 1990, the federal Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resource s Emergency (CARE) Act also allocated money to be used for local AIDS programs. The Ryan White Act required establishment of local councils to coor- dinate distribution of funds. The first HIV/AIDS Planning Council in King and Snohomish counties was appointed by King County Executive Tim Hill in August 1992 with a membership composed of both Public Health Department representatives and community partners. This was th e first time local AIDS funding decisions were consolidated under one regional entity. The Planning Council had to overcome initial opposition from gay and AIDS activists who feared conflicts of in terest among Council memb ers, and who questioned the early models used to prioritize and allocate funds. The Council sti ll works today to distribute AIDS funding equitably to organizations in King, Snohomis h, and Island counties. By law, one third of the Council members must be agency-unaffiliated people living with HIV who are consumers of care ser- vices. The Council is now known as the Seattle Transitional Grant Area HIV Council. Read more about its work at http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/communicable/hiv/pc/. Who was Ryan White?

Some, thinking that \"AIDS could be treated,\" began to abandon safer-sex practices. The HIV infection rate began to climb. The Public Health Department responded with new outreach efforts, stressing the need to continue pr acticing safer sex and encouraging condom use.

From the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, Public Health saw that condom use was critical to preventing the dis- ease's spread. The challenge was to help people learn to accept safer sex practices as the norm. What was learned about changing behavior Gary Goldbaum: I got involved very early on in many of the CDC's community based intervention studies. I was in- volved from 1989 until about 1994 in thos e studies. I think that they result- ed in some useful insights into how we could really reach out to communi-ties and encourage behavior change. At the same time, subsequent to that period, I think we've come to understand that changing human behavior is really, really difficult. Of course we 've really known this fundamentally, any- one who's ever tried to quit smoking or lose weight or exercise more under-stands how difficult it is to change one's own behavior, and changing the behavior of an entire community is even harder. So we did some work that suggested we can make changes. I think at the same time we started to appreciate - this isn't going to be en ough. And it was fortunate that we were also seeing the advances in technology, the new drugs that were becoming available. Believing you can change Karen Hartfield: So the big grant that we had was a really interesting project, where we looked at health be- havior theories that basically tell us what is going to predict behavior change. Like what things do you have to change in a person in order to get them to change behavior? It's sort of a well-known little fact that knowledge is necessary but insufficient for behavior change. So what we really needed to do was change people's attitudes about the behaviors we wanted them to adopt, like using condoms or abstaining or not using needles, we needed to change the social norms or the subjective norms in the community that condom use is widely accepted, is actually the norm in the community. We needed to make sure - there's a concept called self-efficacy which means that people do not change their behavior unless they actually feel like they can. A good way to look at that is sort of around weight loss. Peo- ple will often say yeah, I'm going to lose weight, I'm going to go on a diet, and then you say, do you really think you can drop 20 pounds? And they're like, I don't really think I can do it. Basically, having a high level of self- efficacy is a predictor for actually making a change, so we did a lot of edu-cation and skill building around condom use, around communicating with partners, relationships - we funded th ings like dating workshops to get peo- ple to try to move their relationship-s eeking from outside of bathhouses into more sort of permanent or trusting kinds of relationships. Those are the kinds of things we did. King Condom: resistance to condoms Frank Chaffee: ... people started promoting cond oms for gay sex as early as '83-84. I remember as part of the Sea ttle Gay Clinic went to one of the big Halloween parties in a gorilla mask and tights, and I was King Condom, and I had this big bag of condoms that I was trying to pass out, and my husband was dressed as a prince with King Kong. And I would be doing a monkey routine and trying to pass out condoms, and a couple of people almost decked me. Like how dare you put that insulting thing in front of me.

[1825620] KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 63 Public standards and the Smut Committee Standards around what content was considered appropriate for the pu blic (what was \"decent\") changed over time. In the 1980s, grant-funded outreach and educational materials had to be vetted by the CDC for approval or censorship. Later, the APP was allo wed to form its own review committee, informally re- ferred to as the Smut Committee. Me mbers included health educators, medical professionals, and the media. The APP gradually became freer to create atte ntion-getting content that resonated with at-risk groups. Public Health sought to strike a balance: creating materials that we re engaging and accurate, while not crossing over into what might be seen as indecency. The most explic it materials were not de- signed for the general public and were placed in ta rgeted venues such as gay bars or bath houses. The formation of the Smut Committee Tim Burak: In the early years, even though we were very fortunate to have a lot of good local support and we were fortunate to get a federal grant, that grant came with strings attached because it was a grant that was administered by people who worked for the govern-ment of Ronald Reagan, including the Attorney Gen-eral, Ed Meese, who - no bones about it, was homo-phobic. There was in certain sectors of the Congress and out of the Attorney General's Office, there were lots of roadblocks to moving fast to getting programs going, and we had restrictions on funds, the CDC had huge restrictions on how they could spend their funds, and actually they were grateful to us, because once they w e r e a b l e t o g e t g r a n t m o n e y u p t o u s i n S e a t t l e , w e were able to buy furniture, to put an office together, to do stuff that at the CDC they had to almost take back to Congress to get permission to do th ings like that - to buy a computer. We bought the first computer - it's hard to imagine now that we were doing any of this work without comput- ers, but we got our first computer with all the Bernoulli box, and it was like space age. But we got it because we were able to buy it here, the CDC people weren't able to buy computers there, and it was because of polit-ical strings that were attached. Then when we started designing materials and designing programs and posters and handouts and whatnot to teach people how to have safe sex or use condoms, Jesse Helms was very vocal in Congress at that point and was able to slap lots of restrictions on these federal funds and how they would be used, and so we initially had to run everything we developed by CDC for review, but eventually they reneged and allowed local entities to put together their own review committees to decide what was ap-propriate and what was too explicit or whatnot. We worked fast to develop a review committee here to re- view our education materials and I think we were very smart in how we selected people for that committee, because the credentials couldn't be challenged. We ha d the person at KING-TV whose job it was - he was in charge of broadcast standards and practices and he was the one at KING-TV who had to review everything that ever went out on screen from KING-TV to see whethe r a word needed to be bleeped or if it was too ex- plicit or whatnot. He came and he volunteered to be on our committee. We had a teacher from Seattle Pub-lic Schools, a middle school teacher who was very k nowledgeable in sex education programs within Seattle Public Schools. She sat on that committee. We had the director of the local chapter of the Red Cross sit on that committee. Trying to think of others - representa tive from the University of Washington Medical School who was involved in health education, a representative from the Bellevue School District. These were people who knew what they were doing but also were committed to making sure that we didn't get bogged down and stuck in the mud with censorship issues. So in jest we called it the Smut Committee and they kind of enjoyed being called the Smut Committee and they met once a month and we had everything that we produced, we had it run by them to get their feedback before we could send it out. It wasn't easy doing that. We tried to do it with a sense of humor, like all right, if we're going to beat them at that game.

The single- panel comics were printed on postcards placed in gay bars and bathhouses and were published in gay newspapers. Stella Seat- tle also had a 1995 calendar, mugs, T-shirts, magnets, posters, and, at the end of its run, a comic book with all of the episodes. A Stella Seattle telephone hotline helped the APP evaluate the ef-fectiveness of Stella Seattle's messages. Readers were invited to respond to a question posed by each comic, like \"Do you talk about HIV before having sex?\" The comic's production sta ff would use this feedback to help guide future Stella Seattle topics and story lines. Well-received by the gay community and considered e ffective as an HIV prevention and education cam- paign, Stella Seattle also faced critics. When it first appeared in 1994, the Stella Seattle hotline was jammed with hostile calls. Cover of Stella Seattle comic book published at the end of the series in 1995.

[1825-6-14] KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 68 The Legacy New medications: a sea change In 1994, researchers reported that the medication AZT was found to decrease the chance that babies of HIV-infected women would be born HIV-infected . Testing and treatment for pregnant women were quickly adopted. The new medications were also foun d to be effective in slowing or preventing AIDS- related illness in HIV-positive individuals. At first, treatment was provided to those who were close to becoming ill with AIDS. Then, from 2009, increasingly earlier treatment proved to be more effective in preventing illness, and, more recently, antiretroviral medications have been found to be effective in preventing new HIV infections. The availability of effective treatment changed people 's views on testing, partner notification, and HIV case reporting, as early knowledge of one's HIV-stat us could prove life-saving. No longer a death sen- tence, HIV came to be regarded with less stigma an d fear. A negative impact of this change was that some people began to abandon safer-sex practices, leading to an increased incidence of other STD's, in response to which Public Health rene wed its education and prevention efforts. AIDS: no longer a death sentence Robert Wood: The only other thing I think we haven't talked about is the sea change that occurred in '94 to '98. Let's talk about that a little bit. I was at the time on the CDC's advisory body and I remember very distinctly a meeting - I think it was in Washington, D.C. - wher e data were presented from the study th at was an attempt to reduce vertical transmission from pregnant women to babies, and that study wasn't actually published in the New England Journal of Medicine until November of '94, but we go t to hear the early data in February of '94. I'm blocking on his name, but he was a professor at Harvard - Tim Burak: Dr. Hull? RW: No, I'm blocking on his name. TB: We could find it in the timeline, if we had it to look at. RW: It's not -his name is I don't think in the timeline. TB: \"That guy.\" RW: Yeah, that guy. Anyway, he said this is a sea change, we should announce this as s oon as po ssib le - we need t o get women tested for HIV if they're pregnant and let them benefit from this in- credible result, which was that if a woman who had HIV infection gave birth to a child prior to this study, the risk that the child would be infected was roughly 25 percent. One in four kids born to infected mothers would be born with infection. What the study was, was a study of AZT in the latter part of pregnanc y, and to the baby in the very early da ys after birth, and it showed that you could reduce the transmission from 25 percent to 8 percent. That was a very substantial reduction, and it was the first time we sort of realized that this was a wimpy virus, a virus that even a simple drug like AZT - well, it wasn't a very sim- ple drug - but at least one drug could very substantially reduce the pr obability that a kid would be born with infection. It was a major breakthrough and it was published in November of '94, and all of us began work ing at that point - those of us in AIDS control positions around the country - on changing rules so that women would be sort of opt-out tested for HIV. There was some disgruntlement about that in some of our AIDS activist communities, they weren't quite sure that that was a good idea, but ultimately, we managed to change the rules in the st ate of Washington so that women would be sure to be tested as often as possi ble. The people you miss are the women that are pregnant who don't come in for care, which of course is a problem. An d then later we discovered that sometimes if you even test them early, they might get subsequently infected, still during pregnancy, so then people had to test women repeatedly during pregnan- cy. And then people got smart and said well, if only one drug, AZT, can reduce the rate of transmission from 25 per- cent down to 8 percent, what about multiple drugs? That actually happened after '96, when David Ho's findings got presented up in Vancouver, that suggested if you used mult iple drugs like AZT and DDI and d4T, or a protease inhibitor along with two other drugs, you could basically stop HIV fr om multiplying and make peop le virus-free, although you couldn't really eliminate it from their body. TB: Virus suppressed perhaps. KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 69 RW: Yeah. I was at that meeting and, again, people were aghast that now we had really a way of effectively getting this virus under control, and there was hope in that meeting in Vancouver that actually if you could control the virus for a long period of time in an individual that you might actually be able to wipe it out and actually cure HIV infection. That hasn't happened. It's turned out there are latent places in the body - lymph nodes and other places where the virus hangs out - and once you stop those medi cines, the virus will proliferate again and reestablish the old level of infec- tion, and gradually wear away at the immune system. But that was the sea change, it was the most profound medical development in my life as a physician, for us to have found a way of keeping a virus under control like that. We had a treatment that did something like that fo r herpes, acyclovir was a drug we'd kn own about for a long time, that could keep herpes under control but wouldn't really eradicate it. But this was the first time we could do that with a lethal disease like HIV. So that was an extremely important developm ent. And then the question was who should be treated. There were committees that CDC established and NIH establis hed that included community activists and were national level meetings where peop le debated about really who should be treated, and whether everybody should be treated or just people who were really getting close to AIDS. If you followed T cells you could sort of tell when people were close to AIDS, because their counts would gradually go down and th en at some point they'd get down to two hundred T cells and at that point they were at risk for pneumocystis pneumonia. We wanted to ke ep those people alive, so it made all the sense in the world to treat people whose T cells were low, but then there was a lot of concern about these medi- cines, because they were essentially some kind of chemotherapy. They were interfering and messing with DNA and RNA, and a lot of people were worried th at they might cause cancer themselves and they might have other side effects that were really bad. And of course there was a very high cost associated with these drugs, to the extent that some people couldn't get them, couldn't afford them, their insurance wouldn't pay for them. And there were buyers clubs. The Dallas Buyers Club movie, that was out four or five year s ago, describes a buyers club that was centered in Dallas, that Matthew McConaughey started the movie to sort of desc ribe that. One of our colle agues, Bill Lafferty, who has now died of AIDS, was a member of the Dallas Buyers Club and he was the AIDS epidemiologist for the state for a while. He had HIV infection as well, and I always wondered whether his taking these st range drugs - because he was taking some drugs back in those days that we weren't even sure were the drugs that had been discovered and were being used by David Ho in New York City - I always wonder ed whether that might have contributed to his disease later in life, and his death. But there was a lot of controversy about whether everybody should be treated fo r HIV, and in the early days basically the decision of these committees was th at probably it made sense just to treat people whose T cells were at 350 or lower. That way, we would make sure we were treating people who were about to develop AIDS and we weren't gearing up too many people to all of a sudd en be on a chemotherapy-type treatment. And the systems that existed out there could probably be ar the costs of treating a segment of the population whose T cell counts were relatively low. Actually it wa s in 2009, Mari Kitahata - we're way past the '9 6 deadline, but it wasn't until 2009 that we had enough data from around the country in Madison Clinic type populations wher e we discovered that if people were treated earlier, actually they did better, they had fewer complications, and they lived longer. So I think it was about December of 2009 just before I retired that an article writ ten by one of our local researchers, Mari Kitahata, showed that treating earlier made more sense. She also showed that treating everybody also reduced complications. So ini- tially there was a phase-in of people whose counts were le ss than 500 and then I think in 2013, they went to treating everybody with HIV, and that was possible in our country, but is still not possible globally because of the cost and the difficulties of getting all the meds out there. WHO is gradually expanding the rules around treating people, but some- body had asked me why did we hold off for those years, and not treat everybody right off the bat, and it was I think because the community and the medical establishment basically ki nd of mutually agreed that it made sense to start it out just targeting the people who were about to develop AIDS , and then gradually gather m ore data and figure out real- ly who should be treated. TB: It sounds like what you've just talked about in the last few minutes - this sea change - a big turning point was at that Vancouver international AIDS co nference, when Dr. Ho made his presenta tion. I remember I had left the AIDS program at that point, I was working in another part of the Health Department, but Frank Chaffee went up to Vancou-ver for that conference. I remember him coming back and saying \"Tim, this change s everything.\" That was a real turn- ing point. RW: It did change everything, and I thought it was probably going to be very hard to get all of the doctors to come onboard - I wondered abou t Group Health, for exampl e, because now all of a sudden they were going to have to treat a lot of people with very expensive medici nes. But they were one of the first groups to immediately adopt treatment with multiple drugs. I was just dumbfounded about how fast the medical establishment adopted these new guidelines about recommending treatment for people with HIV and AIDS. Nowadays, we're actually using antiretroviral drugs in combinations to prevent HIV - that was something I had proposed about the time I retired fr om Public Health and I re- member Gary Goldbaum said \"that'll never happen, we will ne ver use these very expensive drugs to prevent HIV.\" But the evidence really accumulated over the next few years, that treating people in this way kept them from getting infect- ed and insurance companies bought it and now we're increasing ly trying to get more and more high risk people onto Truvada, as one the of the meds that keeps people from getting infected. Th ere's some hope we might actually be able to stop this epidemic in its tracks in resource rich countries like our own, and maybe even in the globe at some point. KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 70 The epidemic peaks 1996 was the first year the CDC reported a national de cline in AIDS deaths, attr ibuted both to new med- ications and a slowing of the epidemic and new cases of HIV. In the third quarter of 1996, Dr. Robert Wood, lookin g back at the first ten years of AIDS control, an- nounced in the state's HIV/AIDS Quarterly Epidemiology Report \"the first (and very welcome) news that the local AIDS epidemic has reached a peak.\" But, continued Dr. Wood, it was no time to slacken e fforts. People were still becoming sick and dying. Continued and increased support for prevention prog rams was needed, including \"clear and explicit communications about the behaviors which presented risks, and [about] realistic steps to maintain safety.... Our youth are at greatest risk....\" I think it has been beneficial for society to have had to struggle with a very serious disease for which there is yet no cure or pre- ventative vaccine. [Instead of relying on medicines], HIV con- trol has had to rely on...behavio r change, targeting socially disparate and disadvantaged communities. \"More frighteningly than many diseases, HIV has also highlighted for us the tight interconnections between dis- eases and social factors like poverty, homelessness, stig- matization, discrimination, and lack of fully effective sex and drug education. - Dr. Robert Wood, 1996. HIV today in Seattle and King County By 2015, HIV infection rates had dropped by one-thir d nationwide. Most of that decline occurred among heterosexuals and injection drug users. On the na tional level, the infection rate among men who had sex with men remained the same. But, in contrast to other areas of the country, Sea ttle-King County showed a decline in HIV among gay men. In a July 2014 radio interview, Dr. Matthew Golden, director of the Public Health Department's combined HIV/STD program, credited several historical factors contributing to the depart- ment's comparative success in combatting AIDS: Better funding for HIV/AIDS prevention and care in Washington State and King County than nationally A demographic that did not disproportio nately include injection drug users Excellent collaboration with engaged community groups to bring AIDS prevention messages to groups at risk, particularly gay men An efficient public health system \"We are bene ng today from a long term investment in preven on and care,\" - Dr. Mahew Golden, 2014. KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 71 AIDS is not history Public Health continues to fight HIV/AIDS today. Between 1996 and March 31, 2016, over 2,000 people in King County died of AIDS. And, in the past five years, over 1,200 people have been newly diagnosed as HIV-positive. (Source: Public Health Seattle/King County HIV/AIDS Quarterly Surveillance Report, through March 31, 2016 ). Looking back The AIDS epidemic has had a lasting impact on the nation, on the region , and on individuals. In the fol- lowing clips from the oral histories, interviewees refl ect on the epidemic and the AIDS Prevention Project. Patricial McInturff: Thinking back on it in retrospect, those were probably the most exciting, fulfilling, emotionally charged days of my career. It was all new, and the people who sort of came to- gether around this are probably some of the smartest, most dedi- cated people I've ever worked with in my career - I guess it speaks to the fact that here 30 years later, many of them are still some of my best friends in life....these were fabulous people who cared, who were smart, who were - this was not a job anymore, this was really a passion. And on the other side of it many of the people who came to work at the health department and wanted to work on this issue were people at high risk, so you were working with people you cared about, you were also going to funerals for peo-ple that you worked with every day, and you don't usually start go-ing to funerals in your life at 37 and 38 and 39. So there was lots of mixed emotions. The workday could be emotional to the point of sitting at your desk and crying, or sitting around and trying to plan a new grant and being with people who were twice as smart as I was. So it was a very heady time. And in government - be-cause I spent my whole career in government, I spent a year at the CDC on sabbatical, even, working for the director's office there and watching things - there are very few times in your career you get to design some- thing from scratch. Karen Hartfield I think AIDS was the first time people started thinking about behavior change theory and how that should inter-sect with public health works. That was more like a psychology field, like working with individuals, and sort of thinking about it in terms of how you work with a whole community was brand new. I also think it let us push the envelope in other ways on messaging, that we just became more communi ty focused, so in other parts of public health materials we put out didn't look quite so much like a Benetton ad. It was more personalized.... I could give an example for right now. In CD, where I work now, we're seeing a little bit of a resurgence or a little bit of an out- break of shigella in men who have sex with men, that's an enteric disease that caused unpleasant symptoms and can be treated, but there are now some drug resistant forms of shigella out there. So normally our approach would pro bably be to do a health alert to health care provid- ers, like \"be on the lookout for this, test for this.\" What I was able to do was to actually hire Drew Emory to do a campaign, just a small poster campaign which is very ex plicit about what shigella is and what you should do if you think you have symptoms, and we put that out in the bathhouses and the bars. That's something we probably never would have done before having done this kind of HIV work. KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 72 Robert Wood and Tim Burak RW: I think AIDS is to a large extent responsible for the incredible changes we've seen also in LGBT rights. I never thought as a gay man that I would see gay marriage adopted by the Supreme Court. To me it was astounding that happened, and that it started off in a couple of states, and then really the Supreme Court decided to endorse it. I think that happened because AIDS basically brought LGBT issues to the fore- front, and made everybody pay attention them. They'd sort of been back in the closet with the gay men and the lesbians and the trans folks, and all of a sudden Rock Hudson has AIDS and Arthur Ashe gets AIDS and all these people get AIDS, and some of them are gay, and it brings them out of the closet. People realize they have gay friends, and that their gay friends have romantic relationships but they 're sort of closeted about their relationships. I argued before I retired that it made all the public health sens e in the world to encourage long-term, solid gay relation- ships, gay marriage, from a public health perspective, beca use it would be likely that people in marital relation- ships would probably have fewer outside partners than if pe ople were just meeting up with partners randomly. I think it was AIDS that really brought to the public awar eness the fact that there was this minority population, maybe 3 to 5 percent of gay men and similar numbers of lesbians, and now recently we're talking about trans people. There's a society reaction to these changes which is difficult, but at the same time I think we've bit the bullet and we're moving in a direction where more and more people I think are seen as equals, and ought to have equal rights in all sorts of ways, and trans people ought to be able to go to a bathroom where they're com- fortable. I don't think that would have happened if AIDS hadn't happened. Does that make sense to you? TB: I think I'd rather say if the response to AIDS hadn't happened. RW: Well, maybe it was the response. I mean, I think the Supreme Court is a response to AIDS. TB: True. RW: I mean, if we'd all gone into the closet and died I suppose then AIDS wouldn't have created that, but I don't think that could have happened. Gary Goldbaum When I started in 1989, AIDS was still a death sentence. Basically if you were diagnosed with AIDS, we advised that you get your affairs in order, we'll do everything possible to deal with opportunistic infections and so on, things that were a consequence of AIDS but not actually treating AIDS. At the same time, medicines were starting to ap- pear. The first medicine, AZT, now called zidovudine, had appeared and it was in experimental trials - that by the way was driving real change at the federal level because people were aware, there's a medicine that might have promise. It wasn't ava ilable commercially, it wasn't licensed yet, but there was potential, and everyone understood also, there are going to be other drugs. There was a tremendous interest and funding for research into new treatment modalities. So this was a time when we were all appreciating - gotta gear up, we need to identify who's infected. We now had the tools to test folks for the virus, or at least for an immune re-sponse to the virus, and that was going to allow us then to get people into treatment. But at the same time, folks would want to know, what can I get treated for? Well, su ddenly we were starting to see some new drugs that can directly treat HIV infection, and that was driving demand , huge demand within the infected community, and actu- ally beyond that, the communities that were most affect ed, especially the gay community. The advocacy at the national level pushed really huge changes in how government did business, so there were changes in how phar-maceuticals were being tested, how we did the studies, and how they were made available. A thing called the Compassionate Use Pathway, which meant if you had AIDS an d you weren't otherwise eligible for a clinical trial, you might still be able to get access to a drug that was not yet licensed for commercial sale. And that was huge. Then there were changes in how studies were being done. There were changes in how we were going about managing folks as medicines were becoming available. It was a much accelerated process. Usually changes in medicine can take anywhere from one to two decades from the time science demonstrates here's what you ought to do until the medical community's really doing it. AIDS accelerated that process because the communities that were most affected said we're not going to wait for you in medicine to come around to understanding how to do the work right. Instead, we're going to make demands of you. And that really drove enormous change in how medicine was being practiced, how public health was being practiced. KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 73 Sharon Hopkins interviewed by Lawrence Knopp LK: ...how has all of this affected you? SH: Well, I gained about 30 pounds (laughs) and got much older during the course of things. No , when you're working that much, your coworkers are kind of your soci al life, at least it was for me. Actually it did affect my family in one very big way, I think. My daughter was born when I was workin g for the HIV-AIDS Project. In fact at the end I had some high blood pressure because I was 40 years old and pregnant, and I had to be on bed rest, so my team came to me while I lay on the couch at home and we had our meet- ings the last three weeks before my daughter was born. Anyway, everybody was of course very supportive of anybody that had kids, because most people in the project were having kids. And when she got older, she used to come into the office with me because she loved the people of the AIDS Project. They were fas- cinating to her. Some of them were kind of flamboyant and they were powerful people. So she'd be 7 or 8 years old, and she could spend a whole afternoon going from person to person, talking to people. And I worried it was impacting their job, they're supposed to be working, but I figured a little of this is okay. She got a lot out of that. In fact we feel it influenced her whole career choice, because she's out of college now and she's working with homeless youth, and she just finished a job in Washington, D.C. She was on con-tract working providing subsidized housing for people recovering from mental illn ess and now she's just tak- en a job working with homeless youth. I'm sure she was so influenced by people in the AIDS Project as a youngster that she went this route. In fact she's so anti-business, she would never dream of working for a for-profit business. While my husband and I are both sc ientists, she majored in politics, her major interest is equity and social justice, and I feel like it came from the AIDS Project. LK: There's a legacy. SH: There is a legacy, yeah - the next generation infl uenced by these people that she got to know. They still Facebook her, Theresa who was a longtime employee here is now in Miami, but they still follow her ca- reer and give her advice and positive feedback on what she's doing. She's just 23 so she's still early in her career. LK: That's a lovely story. SH: It is. I'm glad you drew that out. So that is a big thing. But certainly, what you're doing really affects your life, particularly if you're doing it for that long. At one point, I thought, \"I think over half my friends are gay men. I think that's kind of cool.\" LK: Tim's right, we're getting a lot of this sense that we were making history. That's why I asked you the question about dramatic moments is a lot of people seem to feel that they were living some really powerful history, and making history and making important legacies. SH: For instance, two days ago, there were emails going around about Bill Ford, who was one of the ear- ly employees who died 20 years ago now, we were all remembering him through some emails, just thinking back. He was really I think the first person to die from this immediate group. Not too many did from this small group. Many of them, they're out, they're HIV posi tive, but they're still doing pretty darn well. And they lived long enough to get into the era of the good treatments, thankfully. Like Dr. Bob Wood is skiing in the Alps and having a good time in his retirement and I keep in touch with him. Yeah, it's a family. It's kind of trite to say that, but it turned out to be a family and it's always great to go back and see everybody. KING COUNTY ARCHIVESResponding to AIDS: The Sea leKing County Department of Public Health 1982 1996 King County Archives, 2016 74 Ann Downer: ...the ground shifted with AIDS , our culture shifted, our lan- guage shifted - the way we th ink about relationships, ac- ceptance of the different expressions of sexuality, everything changed with AIDS. I don't think people yet even decades later realize what a pivotal moment that was. And just from a personal point of view, I went into the University of Washing-ton to be the director of a health care program that prepared doctors and nurses to treat AIDS patients, that morphed into the global HIV-AIDS health system strengthening work that I do now. So my own life has shifted with it, but everybody else's has too. I know everyb ody I worked with back then, I know almost everyone still, those are formative experiences and people stay in touch, and everybody remembers who did-n't make it through that period. Gary Goldbaum: I think perhaps the most importan t lesson of AIDS is that we mustn't forget what happens when you have a disease that can be highly stigmatizing and we need to always keep that in mind. For example, Ebola - well, did we observe overreac-tion to Ebola in this country? Governors who basically said you are going to be isolated, people who were the medical volunteers going to Africa, forgetting that they need to really think about what's the best science, how do we avoid stigma-tizing, what strategies do we want in the community, how do we engage the community so that this isn't just government's overreaction. I'd say that's th e most important lesson I take away from the AIDS era. I al so have learned subsequent to my experience working directly with AIDS, in my current role as director of a public health agency where I'm thinking about a lot of different conditions and wher e I actually have to think very holistically about my agency and how it allocates its resources. One of the things we've observed with HIV and AIDS has been a transition from a time where resources to take care of people were frankly not available and it required d e d i c a t i n g r e s o u r c e s . O t h e r s h a v e n o w l e a r n e d f r o m t h a t e x p e r i e n c e - m a y b e w e n e e d d e d i c a t e d r e - sources for other conditions. That's been a powerful tool in the community. At the same time it has creat- ed a challenge, as we've moved away from an era wher e there weren't resources to take care of people, to an era now where we have the Affordable Care Act an d health care transformation quite independently of the Affordable Care Act, but an opportunity for us to move in a new direction. This was not anticipated at the time. At the time AIDS was really appearing, the medical community did not want to have anything to do with people with AIDS - didn't want to take care of them, didn't feel that they had anything to offer, of-tentimes it was affecting folks who weren't insured and medicine is a business. That was a really bad time and we learned from it that in that kind of setting you need to set aside, dedicate resources. Today we have new opportunity to try and assure that everyone in this country has full access to care. It should nev-er again happen that we have to set aside resources because people can't get the care that they need in an existing open welcoming highly functional, high quality system. And that's a change.

Dr. Downer was a member of the original team that founded the Seattle-based Committee for Children in 1981. Committee for Children is a non-profit organization based in Seattle that has taught mil- lions of children the skills needed for managing their emotions, problem solving, and seeking help if they are being hurt. Teach-ers in schools all over the worl d now use the social and emotion- al learning materials of Committee for Children. Dr. Downer joined the Seattle-King County Dept. of Public Health (SKCDPH) in early 1986 as the first Health Educator on the CDC-funded demonstration pr oject called The AIDS Project. Dr. Bud Nicola led the well-regarded SKCDPH at that time, and Ann reported to Dr. Bob Wood, a pioneering HIV/AIDS spe- cialist. Ann and her team supported development of behavioral research protocols and produced some of the first AIDS prevention campaigns in the state of Washingt on. Many of those mass media cam- paigns, curriculum products, and behavioral interventions are still in use today. Dr. Downer left the health department in 1989 for an appointment on the faculty of the University of Washington (UW), Department of Health Services. Sh e transferred into the newly formed Department of Global Health when it was established in 2007. Duri ng her many years at UW, Dr. Downer has taught courses on mass media in health, educational theor y, health promotion planning, and management and leadership.

The online exhibit was published in June, 2016. The exhibit and oral histories are not intended to provide a comprehensive history of AIDS in Seattle-King County, but rather to document one facet of the history: the accomplishments, challenges, and pe rspectives of Public Health staff. In addition, the records presented here are only a small percentage of the Archives' Public Health collection, and the exhibit only touches on some of the complex issues and challenges faced by the program and the community. Researchers are en- couraged to contact the Archives to review the collection, which includes re cords from beyond this exhibit's 1996 cutoff date. As the Archives processed the records of the AIDS Prevention Project and began research for th is exhibit, former AIDS Pre- vention Project Coordinator Tim Burak helped us identify people , places, and events in collect ion photos. On hearing just a few of Tim's reflections and stories, it be came apparent that the unique experience s and perspectives of people working in public health were missing from the familiar narrative of the AIDS epidemic in our region. We hope that the interviews will help complete the historical record. Oral history interviews with former and cu rrent employees of the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health were pro- duced with support from a 4Culture Heritage Project Grant funded by the 4Culture/King County Lodging Tax Fund. We are grateful to all who shared their stories for the oral hi story project. Thanks to Michae l Brown, Lawrence Knopp, and David Reyes\u2014volunteers with the Northwest Lesbian and Gay History Museum Project \u2014who generously donated their time planning for and conducting the oral history interviews.

This print document was developed in December of 2016 to create a tangible record of the online exhibit located at http:// respondingtoaidsexhibit.org. The print vers ion provides transcriptions of the video cl ips that are interspersed throughout the exhibit. An attempt was made to retain the overall feel of the online experience. Still, though the substantive text of the e x- hibit has not been changed or shortened, much of the original layout has been modified to fit a book format. And, documents that were linked to from the online exhibit are not presented in full in this printed version. However, all cited records are p ub- licly available at the King County Archives.
