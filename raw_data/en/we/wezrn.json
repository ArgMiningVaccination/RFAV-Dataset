A common format for the technical documentation will significantly reduce the time and resources needed to compile applications for registration of human pharmaceuticals and will ease the preparation of electronic submissions. Regulatory reviews and communication with the applicant will be facilitated by a standard document of common elements. In addition, exchange of regulatory information between Regulatory Authorities will be simplified. BACKGROUND Through the ICH process, considerable harmonisation has been achieved among the three regions in the technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceuticals for human use. However, until now, there has been no harmonisation of the organisation of the registration documents. Each region has its own requirements for the organisation of the technical reports in the submission and for the preparation of the summarie s and tables. In Japan, the applicants must prepare the GAIYO, which organises and presents a summary of the technical information. In Europe, Expert Reports and t abulated s ummaries are required, and w ritten s ummaries are recommended. The U . S . FDA has g uidance regarding the format and content of the New Drug Application. To avoid the need to generat e and compil e different registration dossiers, this guideline describes a format for the Common Technical Document that will be acceptable in all three regio ns. SCOPE OF THE GUIDELI NE This guideline primarily addresses the organisation of the information to be presented in r egistration a pplications for new pharmaceuticals (including biotechnology - derived products). This guideline is not intended to indicate wh at studies are required. It merely indicates an appropriate format for the data that have been acquired. Applicants should not modify the overall organisation of the Common Technical Document as outlined in the guideline. However, in the Nonclinical and Clinical Summaries, a pplicants can modify individual O rganisation of The Common Technical Document 2 format s if needed to provide the best possible presentation of the technical information, in order to facilitate the understanding and evaluation of the results. GENERAL PRINCIPLES Throughout the Common Technical Document, the display of information should be unambiguous and transparent, in order to facilitate the review of the basic data and to help a reviewer become quickly oriented to the application contents. Text and tables should be prepared using margins that allow the document to be printed on both A4 paper (E . U . and Japan) and 8.5 x 11 \" paper (U . S . ). The left - hand margin should be sufficiently large that information is not obscured by the method of binding. Font sizes for text and tables shoul d be of a style and size that are large enough to be easily legible, even after photocopying. Times New Roman, 12 - point font, is recommended for narrative text. Every page should be numbered , according to the granularity document . Acronyms and abbreviat ions should be defined the first time they are used in each module. References should be cited in accordance with the current edition of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals , International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) 1 . ORGANISATION OF THE COMMON TECHNICAL DOC UMENT The Common Technical Document is organized into five m odules. Module 1 is region specific. Modules 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 are intended to be common for all regions. Conformance with this guideline should ensure that these four modules are provided in a format acceptable to the r egulatory a uthorities. Module 1 . Administrative Information and Prescribing Information This mo dule should contain documents specific to each region; for example, application forms or the proposed label for use in the region. The content and format of this module can be specified by the relevant r egulatory a uthorities. Module 2 . Common Technical Document Summaries Module 2 should begin with a general introduction to the pharmaceutical, including its pharmacologic class , mode of action, and proposed clinical use. In general, the Introduction should not exceed one page. Module 2 should contain 7 sections in the following order : CTD Table of Contents CTD Introduction Quality Overall Summary Nonclinical Overview Clinical Overview Nonclinical Written and Tabulated Summaries Clinical Summary The organisation of these summaries is described in Guidelines for M4Q, M4S, and M4E. 1 The first edition of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals was conceived by the Vancouver Group and was published in 1979. Organisation of The Common Technical Document 3 Module 3 . Quality I nformation on Quality should be presented in the structured format described in Guideline M4Q . Module 4 . Nonclinical Study Reports The nonclinical study reports should be presented in the order described in Guideline M4S. Module 5 . Clinical Study Reports The human study reports and related information should be presented in the order described in Guideline M4E . The overall organisation of the Common Technical Document is presented on the follow ing pages.

Could guidance be provided for all modules on headings in relation to document location and the section headings within those documents? Could guidance also be provided on where in the CTD and eCTD multiple documents can be located in the hiera rchy? As a consequence of this definition could guidance be given on how documents should be paginated and on what the module Table of Contents should therefore include? Definition of a Document A document is defined for a paper submission as a set of page s, numbered sequentially and divided from other documents by a tab (see Document Pagination and Segregation section of this Annex). A document can be equated to a file for an electronic submission. The granularity of the paper and electronic submissions should be equivalent, although if a paper submission is updated to be an electronic submission, some changes in granularity could be introduced to facilitate on - going lifecycle management. In an electronic submission, a new file starts at the same point a t which in a paper submission, a tab divides the documents. In deciding whether one or more documents or files are appropriate, it should be considered that once a particular approach has been adopted, the same approach should be used throughout the life o f the dossier since it is the intention that replacement documents/files be provided when information is changed. The following tables describe the levels in the CTD/eCTD hierarchy at which documents/files should be placed and whether single or multiple documents are appropriate at each point. This describes all sections of a CTD/eCTD but for individual submissions all sections might not be applicable. For modules 2 .3 and 3 , the recommended granularity depends on the version of the eCTD standard that is used to prepare the submission , wher e as the same Module 4 and 5 granularity applies to all eCTD standards . For submissions filed using eCTD v 3.2.2 : Refer to Tables 1, 2, 5 and 6, as well as the additional guidance provided in separate ICH eCTD Q&As. F or submissions filed using eCTD v4 : Refer to Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6, as well as the additional guidance provided in Appendices A - F. For paper CTD submissions : Refer to Tables 1, 2, 5 and 6 OR Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 . ( Additionally, see r egional guidance.)

Applicants need not display the number as \" 1 of n \" where n is the total number of pages in the document. Additionally, all pages of a document should include a unique header or footer that briefly identifies its subject matter. In a pap er - based drug submission, a similar identifier should be used on a tab that precedes the document, to facilitate finding that document within the dossier. An abbreviation of the full section number and title can be used. If a section contains more than o ne document, a specific Table of Contents for that section can be included to identify the chronology and titles of the documents contained therein, e.g. Tab with \" 3.2.S.4.2 Analytical Procedures \" o Table of Contents, listing the title of Procedure A, Proce dure B, Procedure C Tab with \" 3.2.S.4.2 Procedure A \" ; o Procedure A (i.e. document, page 1 - n) Tab with \" 3.2.S.4.2 Procedure B \" ; o Procedure B (i.e. document, page 1 - n) Tab with \" 3.2.S.4.2 Procedure C \" ; o Procedure C (i.e. document, page 1 - n) If a section con tains only a single document (e.g. 3.2.S.1.1 Nomenclature), only a tab identified by \" 3.2.S.1.1 Nomenclature \" should precede the document. Section Numbering within Documents In order to avoid 5 th , 6 th etc. level subheading numbering (e.g. 2.6.6.3.2.1) within a document, the applicant can use a shortened numbering string. In this case, the document number and the name (e.g. 2.6.6 Toxicology Written Summary) should appear in page headers or footers and then section numbering within the document can be used, for example, 1, 1.1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2 etc. Use of the full numbering string (e.g. 2.6.6.3.2.1) is also considered acceptable. Table of Contents Formatting Module 2 The 2.1 CTD Table of Contents should go down to the third (e.g. 2.3.S) or fourth (e.g. 2.3.S.1) level, depending on how a document is defined for the Quality Overall Summary. (See Definition of a document for Module 2 .) Module 3 The Table of Contents provided under 3.1 should cover the hig h - level section numbering, the associated section heading and the Volume number in the order that they appear in the drug submission. This Table of Contents would be used to identify the contents of Module 3 as defined in the M4Q guideline. It should go down to the fifth level only (e.g. 3.2.P.2.1). Note that additional subsections and subheadings are defined in the M4Q guideline beyond this level (e.g. under 3.2.P.2) and this formatting should be used within the dossier, despite not being included in th e 3.1 Table of Contents. The lower level Table of Contents described O rganisation of The Common Technical Document 16 under Document Pagination and Segregation should be excluded from the 3.1 Table of Contents. At the applicant ' s discretion, a Table of Contents can also be included for a particular section that contains multiple documents, in order to identify the chronology and the document subject matter. If there is a desire to introduce additional headers or subsection numbe ring beyond those which are defined in the M4Q guideline, these should only be included within a document and should be created neither as a separate document nor as a new subsection. In this case, a specific Table of Contents for that document can be incl uded to identify the chronology and titles of the subsections contained therein. These documents and subsections should not appear in the 3.1 Table of Contents. Furthermore, additional attachments or appendices should not be incorporated into this forma tting, except as a document under a section where multiple documents might be provided. In this case, a cross - reference should be made within the relevant section to the attached or appended document. If there is a desire to append or attach additional i nformation to a section that is comprised of only one document, this information should be incorporated within that document. All Table of Contents title entries should either correspond to heading names and section numbering as defined in the M4Q guide line or to identifiers appearing on tabs (for a paper - based drug submission only), preferably by their full title, which should easily identify any abbreviated title that might be used on the corresponding tab. The Table of Contents should not specify any page numbers. Literature References should be listed in a Table of Contents specific for this section. Module 4 The Table of Contents for Module 4 should include all of the numerical items listed in the CTD guideline in order to identify all of the impo rtant components of the application (for example, 4.2.3.5.1 Fertility and early embryonic development ) and should continue down to at least the level of the study report. Thus each study report should be identified in the table of contents. The sections of a study report could be identified in the Module 4 Table of Contents of the dossier or only in the Table of Contents of the individual study report.

Thus each clinical study report should be identified in the table of contents. The sections of a clinical s tudy report (E3) could be identified in the Module 5 Table of Contents of the dossier or only in the Table of Contents of the individual clinical study report.

The applicant decides when and how to use these keywords . In all cases, a short informative value is adequate per keyword , since the keyword is intended to be an aid to a viewer of the application (e.g., to differentiate different drug substance or drug product sections), and not for computerized data management. Alternatively, docum ents could be differentiated by using unique titles, or by explaining differences within one document (e.g. , with a comparative table of the manufacturing processes). The keywords used in Module 2.3 need not match those used in Module 3. For Module 2.3, th e least granular option is a document that covers all topics, in which case there are no keywords. If the applicant uses a finer level of granularity ( e.g., 2.3.S ) a document (or documents with unique titles) could be provided using separate values for \" s ubstance \" and /or \" manufacturer \" . In this case, 2.3.S and 3.2.S keyword values (if used) can be different. The \" substance \" keyword was designed primarily to distinguish different drug substances found in drug products containing multiple drug substances or for different drug products that are co - packaged. An International Non - proprietary Name (INN) is recommended for this keyword . L ong INN names may be shortened. C onsider the inclusion of any moiety to distinguish between different salt - forms that can be used in different dosage forms. If an INN is not available, a company code will suffice. The \" manufacturer \" keyword was designed to facilitate lifecycle management where there might be different manufacturers ( e.g., using a different drug substanc e route of synthesis (chemical entity) or manufacturing process (biologic) ) . If the applicant determines that there is no need to have multiple 3.2.S or 3.2.P sections ( e.g., where few 3.2.S.x topics have manufacturer/site/process - specific documents (eith er now or likely in the future ) ) then the use of this keyword is not recommended ; there is no benefit of a general umbrella term such as \" all \" or \" applicant \" or \" not specified \" . The value for the \" manufacturer \" keyword might be a firm ' s name, the first wo rd or abbreviation of a long company name, a site name, or simply words that differentiate different routes or processes. Use a term that is less likely to change during the life of the application . The value for the \" product \" keyword could be used to distinguish, for example, between an \" active \" , \" device \" , \" placebo \" , and/or a \" diluent \" drug product section, if applicable. The value for the \" product \" keyword could also be utilized to distinguish between an \" A - type \" versus a \" B - type \" drug product preparation and/or it could include strength information (if a separate 3.2. P section for another strength(s) can be justified). Proprietary names such as t rademarks are not recommended, since proposed trademarks are not always accepte d by authorities (trademark acceptability may not be known until after the eCTD application has been submitted). The value for the \" dosage form \" keyword might consist of short descriptive text such as \" powder for suspension \" . Including details such as strength, concentration, or fill volume in t he \"dosage form\" keyword is not recommended. Organisation of The Common Technical Document 19 Appendix B: Further E xplanation of \" B lue \" Granularity and Control Strategy Summaries \" Blue \" granularity : As of ICH eCTD v4.0, a new \" blue \" granularity option was int roduced to Module 3 . Inclusion of documents at this level is not a new expectation, but documents can be useful in certain circumstances . E xample s are : a cross - reference to a Drug Master File could be placed at the 3.2.S or 3.2.P level a cross - reference to a Certificate of Suitability could be placed at the 3.2.S.4 or 3.2.P.5 level a Note to the Reviewer could be placed a t any \"blue\" (or \"green\") level an Overall Control Strategy Summary could be placed at several possible locations (se e below) . T h ese optional docum ent s should have clear and informative titles . Control strategy summaries: Currently t here are no specific locations defined for control strategy summaries in Module 3, so t he placement of overall control strategy summaries is at the applicant's discretion. For example, o verall control strategy summaries may be placed at the level of 3.2.S.4 and 3.2.P.5.6. T he applica nt should state in Module 2.3 (e.g., 2.3 Introduction) where all the Module 3 control strategy summaries are located . Appendix C: Stability Data G uidance Applicants may choose a granularity that best suits their business needs and as appropriate for the application . The use of the \"descriptor\" k eyword is optional and the applicant decides when and how to use it. Each \"descriptor\" keyword value generates a separate 3.2.S.7.3 and/or 3.2.P.8.3 section. All stability data can be organi s ed using one or multiple documents and within one or multiple Stability Data sections . I f there are several documents within a section , some differentiation can be achieved by informative naming of the documents ' title s . Examples of titles for documents assigned to 3.2. P.8.3 could be: \" B lister - 10 mg - long term storage \" \" B lister - 10 mg - accelerated \" \" Accelerated - bottles - 10 mg, 25 mg \" \" Accelerated - blisters - 10 mg, 25 mg \" \" 36 months - bottles - 10 mg, 25 mg \" When there are multiple documents under a section, the priority number assigned to each document determines the order in which the documents appear within the section . Additional or other information may be provided either in the value for the \"descript or \" keyword or in the document 's title ( e.g., storage condition, orientation of the container, and/or information such as \" primary \" vs. \" supportive \" ) . It is not recommended to use general umbrella terms such as \"all strengths\". Appendix D: Excipient G uidance Applicants may choose a granularity that best suits their business needs and as appropriate for the application. All excipient data can be organi s ed using one or multiple documents and within one or multiple Excipient sections. The use of the \"excipient \" k eyword is optional and the applicant decides when and how to use it. Each \"excipient\" keyword value generates a separate 3.2.P.4 and/or 3.2.A.3 section. The \"excipient\" keyword O rganisation of The Common Technical Document 20 does not have to be used (i.e., only one excipient section can be provided even if there is more than 1 excipient in the drug product). However if repeating 3.2.P.4 sections are used, then the \" excipient \" keyword should be used as it identifies and distinguishes the content of the section. General terms (e.g., \" compendial \" , \" c oating agent \" , \" non - compendial \" ) and/or specifically - named excipient keyword values are acceptable. One or multiple documents can be submitted covering each excipient, all excipients, each excipient topic (i.e., 3.2.P.4.1 - 3.2.P.4.6) , or all excipient topic s: Option 1 (using a single 3.2.P.4 section without any lower level granularity): This option is appropriate if the overall volume of information is small, such as when only compendial excipients are used. In this case, only a single document would typically be submitted at the 3.2.P.4 level, with or without an \" excipient \" keyword, and the document would cover all excipients used and all excipient topics (i.e., 3.2.P.4.x). Option 2 (using multiple 3.2.P.4 sections without lower level granulari ty for 3.2.P.4.x): One or multiple documents can be submitted at the 3.2.P.4 level (and not at a 3.2.P.4.x level) per excipient or grouping of excipients, covering relevant excipient topics. The \" excipient \" keyword is used to identify the name of a singl e or group of excipient ( s ) (e.g., \" compendial \" ). A single document might be used to cover either all topics (3.2.P.4.x) or each topic separately. Option 3 (using multiple 3.2.P.4 sections with 3.2.P.4.x granularity): One or multiple documents can be submitted at the appropriate 3.2.P.4.x level per excipient CTD topic. Multiple documents at the same 3.2.P.4.x level (e.g. , separate documents for each excipient or grouping of excipients covering each of the 3.2.P.4.x topics) can be distinguished using informative document t itles and/or in combination with the use of the \"excipient\" keyword, if desired . Options 2 and 3 might be combined in a sequence . For example, a single document covering all compendial excipients (i.e., a grouping with an excipient keyword of \" compendial \" , for example , can be provided at a 3.2.P.4 level in one section ( O ption 2), but more granular documents can be provided in named or grouped (e.g. , \" coating agent \" ) non - compendial excipient sections at the relevant 3.2.P.4.x levels ( O ption 3). For all options, there is no ICH consensus on granularity if no human, animal, and/or novel excipients are used. Refer to regional guidance recognizing that an \" excipie nt \" keyword such as \" Human - Animal - Novel \" might be a possibility for a separate section used to discuss 3.2.P.4.5 and 3.2.P.4.6 . Considerations when choosing excipient granularity include the amount of information to be provided and future lifecycle potenti al, business processes for the generation and sources of global documentation, and the re - usability of information for worldwide markets. Since the current use of the excipient keyword is intended to be an aid to the viewer of the application, and not for computerized data management, avoid multiple documents per compendial excipient where content is just a reference(s) to a compendial monograph(s). Per ICH M4Q, all components of the dosage form should be listed in 3.2.P.1 (Description and Composition of th e Drug Product), each with its function and reference to a quality standard (e.g., compendial monographs, manufacturer ' s specifications). Within section 3.2.P.4 (Control of Excipients), it is an ICH expectation to provide excipient specifications in 3.2.P .4.1 (Specifications). An optional re - listing of the excipients within 3.2.P.4 or a link back to the list in 3.2.P.1 might be helpful in some cases, but it is not an ICH expectation to repeat a list of excipients in 3.2.P.4. Organisation of The Common Technical Document 21 If a non - compendial excipient becomes compendial If the application has only one 3.2.P.4 section where either the excipient keyword is not used or the excipient keyword is used without \" compendial \" or \" non - compendial \" as its keyword value , then affected document (s) can be r eplaced o r removed . If the application contains more than one 3.2.P.4 section: I f the excipient name was used as the keyword value and there is no other section for grouped compendial excipient(s) ( e.g., \" compendial \" as its keyword value ) then the affected document content needs to be updated (or a new document created) . A n option f or the next s equence is to apply a status code value of \"s uspended \" in the original section ; then create a new 3.2.P.4 section with a new identifier and a new keyword value (e.g., \"compendial\" ) and apply the updated or new document to the new 3.2.P.4 section . I f groupings of excipients were used with keyword values of \" compendial \" and \" non - compendial \" , for example, then in the compendial section any affected document (s) is(are) r eplaced with the updated content. In the non - compendial section, the document (s) that now correspond to pharmacopoeial content have the status c ode value of \"suspended\" applied to them. I f extensive information was provided in 3.2.A.3 on the originally non - compendial excipient, apply the statu s c ode value of \"suspended\" if there is a desire to no longer maintain or lifecycle this information under 3.2.A.3 . If an excipient is renamed As of ICH eCTD v4.0, it is possible to change the keyword value or display name . For a novel excipient that is no longer regarded as being novel I f there is a desire to no longer maintain or lifecycle this information under 3.2.P.4.6 and/or 3.2.A.3, as applicable , then apply the status code value of \"suspended\" t o the original section . Update 3.2.P.4 to acknowledge that the excipient is no longer regarded as novel. Appendix E: Container C losure S ystem G uidance Applicants may choose granularity that best suits their business needs. All container closure informat ion could be in one document or multiple documents and within one or multiple Container sections. The use of the \"container\" k eyword is optional and the applicant decides when and how to use it. Each \"container\" keyword value generates a separate 3.2. P. 7 section (e.g. , for products supplied in more than one type of container closure system) . I f there are several documents within a section , some differentiation can be achieved by informative naming of the documents ' title s . Examples of titles of docume nts assigned to 3.2.P.7 could be: \" Description - Blister \" \" Description - HDPE Bottle - 50 mL \" \" HDPE Bottle - 50 mL - Description \" \" HDPE Bottle - 50 mL - Manufacturers \" \" HDPE Bottle - 50 mL - Specification \" O rganisation of The Common Technical Document 22 When there are multiple documents under a section, the priority number assigned to each document determines the order in which the documents appear within the section. Additional or other information may be provided in the document title ( e.g . , packaging component information (Al lidding, PVC laminate ) ) to differentiate documents . Alternatively, individual document s for each container closure system (e.g., bottles vs. blisters) could be provided. Appendix F: G uidance on Using the \"Facility\" and \"Component\" Keywords Applicants may choose granularity that best suits their business needs. Facility: The use of the \"facility\" k eyword is optional and the applicant decides when and how to use it. Each \"facility\" keyword value generates a separate 2.3.A.1 and/or 3.2.A.1 s ection. All facility information could be in one document or multiple documents and within one or multiple Facility sections. The value for the \"facility\" keyword might be a town or a site ' s location (e.g., \" East Park \" ) or it might be more specific (e.g., \" East Park Building 2 \" ). Additional details may be used in the naming of the document titles appearing under the 2.3.A.1 and/or 3.2.A.1 section to further supplement the keyword value . Although documents containing in formation that is applicable to more than one 3.2.A.1 section (e.g., room classifications) can be placed under each section , r eviewer preference is to minimize the number of documents with identical content. If only a limited number of documents can be sh ared across sections , use less specific keyword values (resulting in fewer sections) instead of detailed values ( that result in many sections ) . If a sufficient number of documents are common across facilities, only one 3.2.A.1 sectio n can be provided (i.e ., without a keyword ) and combined with the use of distinctive document titles or comparative tables within the documents. Component: The use of the \"component\" k eyword is optional and the applicant decides when and how to use it. E ach \"component\" keyword value generates a separate 2.3.A.2 and/or 3.2.A.2 section. All adventitious agent safety evaluation information could be in one document or multiple documents and within one or multiple adventitious agent safety evaluation sections (i.e., each section covering a different drug substance and/or drug product \"component\"). For products containing a single drug substance and requiring an adventitious agents safety evaluation , one 3.2.A.2 document cover ing both the 3.2.S and 3.2.P secti ons may be sufficient . The use of a \"component\" keyword is not necessary in this case. For drug products containing multiple drug sub s tances (e.g. , multiple component vaccines or combination products), it may be appropriate to provide a separate adventit ious agents safety evaluation for each drug substance component, in which case a unique \"component\" keyword may be used to identify and distinguish the information in repeated sections , with the combined use of one or multiple documents . For some combinati on products, where an adventitious agents safety evaluation may need to be provided for each drug substance component as well as the combined product, the use of the \"component\" keyword may also be practical in combination with one "}
