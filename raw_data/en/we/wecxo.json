To get scientific, they're \"the consequence of inflammatory cells coming in to stop bleeding, prevent infection, and lay down new collagen to 'close' the wound,\" explains [Cybele Fishman](https://www.cybelefishmanmd.com/), a board-certified dermatologist and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital. And although they're a natural and necessary process, you might not want to necessarily be reminded of your scars forever. Luckily, there are ways to minimize scarring or even prevent them from forming. \"There isn't a quick fix for treating scars, but early treatment like preventing a scab and avoiding sun exposure to the area are the best ways to minimize the risk of scarring,\" says skin-care educator and CEO of [Barefaced Jordan Harper](https://www.barefaced.com/). As the early stages of scar treatment are so critical, when we asked 21 skin-care experts about the scarring products they recommend, a lot of them focused on preventative methods. But if you're someone who's had a scar for a long time, don't be dismayed: The experts also told us about plenty of items to protect existing scars and encourage those scars to heal. One of those methods was an in-office laser treatment to really effectively improve the appearance of scars, our experts say. \"Lasers can target pigment in the scar or help remodel the collagen to heal the scar texture,\" board-certified dermatologist [Dr. Anna Karp](https://www.sinyderm.com/provider/dr-anna-karp) told us. Micro-needling has become a popular in-office treatment for scarring, especially that is caused by acne, according to Fishman. The process uses \"fine needles to mechanically disrupt the skin and cause a controlled wound, which then sets about repair mechanisms in your skin to build more collagen and elastic tissue.\" That doesn't mean there aren't ways to help heal scars at home. \"The goal is to treat wounds early and well to prevent the formation of a hypertrophic scar, which is a raised scar that stays within the confines of the wound,\" explains dermatologist [Anita Cela](https://www.nyp.org/physician/arcela), who specializes in cosmetic dermatology. To help, we talked to dermatologists about the most effective over-the-counter products for getting rid of scars and what to use to prevent a scar from forming in the first place. Because there is no all-in-one, holy-grail scar treatment, we've instead organized their recommendations into an easy-to-follow step-by-step guide to treating scars. However, that doesn't mean you can't help heal scars at home. Below, we've included 16 items that our skin-care experts have recommended for treating and preventing scars, as well as some tips on how to use them. Because there is no all-in-one, holy-grail scar treatment, we've instead organized their recommendations into an easy-to-follow step-by-step guide to treating scars. What we're looking for Function Scar care is multistep, so we've noted whether a product is best for scar prevention, protection, or healing. Active ingredients As we've mentioned, the best solution for getting rid of scars is in-office treatment, but topical ingredients can help with everything from keeping a wound from getting infected to fading the scar altogether. Antioxidants like vitamin C, for example, help to improve hyperpigmentation and help to address the underlying inflammation that causes it in the first place. Another ingredient, silicone, helps skin to heal properly and avoid raised scarring. Best antibacterial ointment to prevent neomycin, pramoxine HCl, polymyxin B It's critical to clean a wound when it first happens, and any foreign materials \u2014 think bits of gravel or dirt \u2014 can cause even worse scarring and long-term discoloration, according to Dr. Melissa Doft of [Doft Plastic Surgery](https://doftplasticsurgery.com/). Once a wound is clean, Doft suggests maintaining a moist (but not wet) environment around it. She's a fan of Neosporin for its antibiotic qualities. This particular formula is designed to minimize the look of scars along with providing itch relief. But dermatologist Dr. Kseniya Kobets warns that it isn't suitable for everyone. \"Neosporin has two highly allergenic antibiotics neomycin and polymyxin, which can cause a skin reaction,\" she says. \"It's probably especially bad to put on broken skin, as it will sensitize the body for next time it's going to be used on the skin.\" Instead, she recommends a [bacitracin-only ointment](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0010WNMHU?tag=thestrategistsite-20&ascsubtag=__st0613aam__cjjfr8ent008m1fy6oh7t5wyb________________). Best ointment to prevent scarring Function: Prevention | Active ingredients: Petrolatum After initially cleaning the wound, it's important to carry on keeping it clean, moist, and covered in the following weeks \u2014 before you even start using a scar treatment. \"Don't let the wound get infected,\" cautions [Dr. Kenneth Howe](https://wexlerdermatology.com/about/dr-kenneth-howe/) of Wexler Dermatology. After you've treated the wound with a topical antibiotic like Neosporin, [Dr. Jennifer Chwalek](https://www.unionderm.com/about/dr-jennifer-chwalek/), who practices with Union Square Laser Dermatology, says that \"you want to keep the wound hydrated with something like Aquaphor, as this promotes faster healing.\" It's a myth that you want to air out the wound and let it dry, because that will form a scab, which can cause more scarring and take longer to heal says [Dr. Adrienne O'Connell](https://www.lagunabeachaesthetics.com/), president and medical director of Laguna Beach Aesthetics. \"Aquaphor will keep the wound hydrated and thus promote healing.\" Aquaphor is also a favorite of Dr. [Rachel Nazarian](https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/rachel-nazarian-m-d/), a dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group, for its infection prevention and protection that stimulates the healing of wounds. Best barrier ointment to prevent scarring Treatment: Prevention | Active ingredient: Petroleum jelly \"I recommend as an some people are allergic to, \"and it can add a contact dermatitis on top of the inflammation from the wound.\" Vaseline is pure petroleum jelly, so she says \"it will add a layer of protection and act as a barrier to protect the wound while also promoting wound healing.\" Fellow dermatologist and founder of [Roswell Skin](http://www.roswellskin.com/) Dr. Brandon Cometti also recommends Vaseline, but as an alternative to Neosporin. \"If you experience irritation or redness when applying an antibiotic ointment, then you should stop and switch to a plain emollient,\" he says. Best hydrating ointment to prevent scarring Function: Prevention | Active ingredients: Honey \"Honey has been used for centuries for wound healing because of its antibacterial and hydrating properties, especially in burn wounds,\" says dermatologist Adeline Kikam, founder of [@brownskinderm](https://www.instagram.com/brownskinderm/), a platform dedicated to skin care and dermatology information in skin of color. While there haven't been many studies on how honey heals wounds, Kikam says that new research suggests it can help with scar reduction, so she says it's worth trying on mild wounds and burns. Fishman seconded this sentiment, saying that honey features antimicrobial compounds and an acidic pH, which helps with wound-healing. Best spray to prevent scarring Function: Prevention | Active ingredients: Hypochlorus acid Karp agrees that your top priority should be keeping the area around a scar clean, and she prefers hypochlorous-acid sprays to prevent bacterial growth, explaining that this antibacterial and anti-inflammatory acid is actually naturally found in our bodies (thanks to our white blood cells) and that most people aren't sensitive to it, either. Best sunscreen to protect scars Function: Protection | Active ingrediens: Zinc oxide Protecting the wound from the sun is also key. That's especially true of newer wounds, since \"some protection is essential for the first six months while the scar is remodeling and healing,\" Doft explains.\"The sun is your enemy and will impede good wound healing and worsen the scar,\" says Fishman. [Evan Rieder](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1376718809/evan-a-rieder), a board-certified dermatologist and faculty member in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone (he's also board-certified in psychiatry), agrees: \"Any sort of exposure will make the scar darker.\" Rieder recommends sunscreen with physical blockers, or those that contain active mineral ingredients, like zinc and titanium. Howe says that \"a fresh wound or scar is more prone to sunburn than normal skin,\" and that \"a titanium- or zinc-containing sunscreen that's at least an SPF 30 should be applied daily.\" He and Cela recommend sunscreens from EltaMD, which happens to be a [Strategist ](http://nymag.com/strategist/2018/05/eltamd-sunscreen-sale-at-dermstore-2018.html) [favorite](http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-sunscreens-for-face-according-to-dermatologists.html). Best silicone sheets for scars Function: Treatment | Active ingredients: Silicone The ideal time to start treating the scar is a week or two after an injury or a surgical incision. All our experts recommend using silicone-based patches (called sheeting) or gels (more on those to come) to treat scars in the early stages of formation. \"Silicone sheets are very effective in treating scars, providing an optimal dressing for helping scars heal,\" says Karp. These are more effective than popular onion-extract-based products like Mederma. According to Howe, silicone-based topicals are \"the simplest OTC treatment for raised, or hypertrophic, scars.\" He says that they work \"by exerting a small amount of compressive pressure on the scar, making it flatten and/or soften.\" Although there aren't definitive medical studies that prove that silicone works best, the dermatologists we spoke to said there are studies and other evidence that show that applying silicone products on a daily basis helps scars maturate appropriately and minimizes cosmetic damage. Dermatologist [Caroline Robinson](https://www.instagram.com/crobinsonmd/?hl=en), founder of [Tone Dermatology](https://tonedermatology.com/), says the theory behind silicone is that it \"mimics our skin barrier and it really helps to lock and trap moisture.\" Chwalek, Karp, Cela, and Fishman all recommend ScarAway, which comes in sheets (as well as a [gel](https://www.amazon.com/ScarAway-Scar-Diminishing-Gel-Gram/dp/B06X17LJF9?tag=thestrategistsite-20&ascsubtag=__st0613aam__cjjfr8ent008m1fy6oh7t5wyb________________)). The sheets are self-adhesive, making them a convenient overnight treatment (no gel-covered skin touching your sheets), and reusable. Consistency \u2014 and patience \u2014 is key when using silicone sheets. Kikam says you must be able to commit to wearing them anywhere from 8-24 hours each day (changing out the sheet daily) for several months to see results. Experts add that ScarAway sheets may also help minimize the appearance of old scars too. Best silicone sheets for thicker scarring Function: Treatment | Active ingredients: Silicone Howe agrees that silicone-based sheets are an effective treatment. He particularly likes these ones, which he says are easy to use: \"The sheets are self-adhesive, so no cumbersome dressing or bandages are required. Just trim the sheet to a size slightly larger than the scar to be treated, and apply overnight.\" Like ScarAway's sheets, he says, \"the silicone in these exerts a gentle pressure that flattens raised-up scars.\" Elliot Weiss, a dermatologist at the [Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York](https://www.laserskinsurgery.com/), also recommends CICA-Care silicone sheets, adding that they're especially \"useful to prevent hypertrophic or thickened scars.\" Best silicone gel for healing scars Function: Treatment | Active ingredients: Silicone For smaller or irregularly shaped wounds, you might prefer using a silicone-based gel over a sheet. When it comes to gels, Howe and Dr. Adarsh Vijay Mudgil of [Mudgil Dermatology](https://www.mudgildermatology.com/) recommend Strataderm. \"It consists of a blend of silicones in a topical gel that you put on once daily without any sticky mess,\" says Howe. The transparent gel both hydrates and protects scars, while the pressure from the silicone helps raised scars that \"contain a good deal more collagen than normal skin\" become \"flatter and less hard,\" according to Howe. Strataderm can also help reduce redness. Mudgil agrees that \"topical gels containing silicone can improve the appearance of scars by reducing thickness and redness.\" He likes Strataderm because it's \"quick drying\" and \"does not contain any ingredients that can cause allergy or irritation,\" but notes, \"tropical treatments really only provide benefit in the very early stages of scar formation.\" During this time, Mudgil advises applying any gel to a scar daily. Best silicone gel with SPF for healing scars Function: Treatment | Active ingredients: Silicone, SPF Another gel product Cela and Chwalek recommend is Biocorneum. It has the added benefit of being SPF 30, so it protects both old and new scars from discoloration and redness caused by the sun. It's also a gel that Levine recommends to patients since \"silicone plus SPF is an ideal combination for scar management.\" Best silicone stick for healing scars Function: Treatment | Active ingredients: Silicone Rounding out our list of expert-recommended silicone products is Pro-Sil, which Cela likes because it comes in a glide-on stick for easy application on the go. Best rich scar cream Function: Treatment | Active ingredients: Oat oil, glycerin As your skin heals, and you feel the urge to itch, Dr. Idriss recommends slathering on something with anti-irritation properties. This French hand cream, she says, does a \"stellar job\" in healing wounds quickly. With soothing oat oil, and the hydrating powerhouse glycerin, the cream should calm the feeling of inflamed skin, and make you less likely to scratch an itch. Best moisturizing scar cream Function: Treatment | Active ingredients: Zinc, shea butter Dr. Idriss also likes this cream from La Roche-Posay. Infused with zinc, it both soothes inflammation and heals \"nicks and scrapes.\" It also contains centella asiatica and shea butter, two ingredients known for their nourishing and hydrating properties. Best exfoliating scar cream Function: [Dr. and Dr. Cometti recommended this ointment from Mederma, to use on old and new scars. \"Scar creams like Mederma (with the ingredient allantoin) have been shown to help minimize scars, so applying one of those regularly for the first few weeks can help,\" says Dr. Cometti. Allantoin is a milky, anti-inflammatory exfoliating ingredient that you'd in scar gels. Function: Treatment | Active ingredients: THD Ascorbate, vitamin E Even after wounds have healed, you may still be dealing with hyperpigmentation. According to Robinson, these areas of discoloration \u2014 commonly seen with acne scars \u2014 are often caused by underlying inflammation. \"There is often some component of inflammation under the surface of the skin that's allowing that hyperpigmentation to be persistent,\" she says. To treat these red and brown spots, she looks for products rich in antioxidants that improve both hyperpigmentation and the skin's overall health. She likes the Revision C+ Correcting Complex serum because \"it addresses both brown and red spots, and it addresses skin quality through the antioxidant function.\" Best less-expensive serum for post-scar ingredients tranexamic acid, glycolic acid, hydroquinone Along with Charlotte Birnbaum of [Spring Street Dermatology](https://springstderm.com/), recommends hydroquinone \u2014 a lightening agent that decreases pigment production \u2014 for dark scars and hyperpigmentation. There are more potent prescription medications with hydroquinone, but for an effective over-the-counter option, she likes this Murad serum.
