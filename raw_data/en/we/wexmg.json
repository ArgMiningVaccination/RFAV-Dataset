Prof Ke is clearly not plagued by false modesty; he informs us that \"I am proud to say that we have gained a reputation as one of the leading Chinese Medicine clinics and teaching institutes in the UK and Europe. One CEO from a leading Acupuncture register commented that we were the best in the country. One doctor gave up his medical job in a European country to come study Chinese medicine at Middlesex University (our partner) - he said simply it was because of Asante. Our patients, from royalty and celebrities to hard working people all over the world, have praised us highly for successfully treating their wide-ranging conditions, including infertility, skin problems, pain and many others. We are also very pleased to have pioneered Acupuncture service in the NHS and for over a decade we have seen tens of thousands of NHS patients in hospitals.\" He provides treatments for any condition you can imagine, courses in various forms of TCM, a range of videos (they are particularly informative), as well as i [nteresting explanations](http://asante-academy.com/chinese-medical-treaments/a-to-z-of-ailments/) and treatment plans for dozens of conditions. From the latter, I have chosen just two diseases and quote some extracts to give you a vivid impression of the Ke's genius: CANCER There are some ways in which Chinese medicine can help cancer cases where Western medicine cannot. Various herbal prescriptions have been shown to help in bolstering the immune system and some herbs can actually attack the abnormal cells and viruses which are responsible for certain types of cancer. Chinese Medicine treatment aims first to increase the body's own defence mechanisms, then to kill the cancer cells. Effective though radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be, they tend to have a drastic effect on the body generally and patients often feel very tired and weak, suffer from stress, anxiety, fear, insomnia and loss of appetite. Chinese Medicine practitioners regard strengthening the patient psychologically and physically to be of primary importance. Chinese Medicine herbal remedies can help reduce or eliminate the side-effects from radiotherapy or chemotherapy. [Astragalus](http://asante-academy.com/*medicinesa-z/milkvetch) will help raise the blood cell count, the sickness caused by chemotherapy can be relieved with fresh ginger and orange peel, and [acupuncture](http://asante-academy.com/theory-a-z/acupuncture-theory) can also help. To attack the cancer itself, depending on type and location, different herbs will be used. A Chinese Medicine practitiioner will decide whether the illness is the result of [qi energy deficiency](http://asante-academy.com/*theory-a-z/qi-deficiency), blood deficiency or tonic herbs may be used. But it is vital to remember that no one tonic is good for everybody. All treatments are dependent upon the individual. Some anti-cancer herbs used are very strong and sometimes make people sick, but this is because one poison is being used against another. How they work, and how clinically effective they are, is still being researched. No claims can be made for them based on modern scientific evaluation. Acupuncture and meditation are also very important parts of the Chinese Medicine traditional approach to the treatment of cancer. These alleviate pain and induce a sense of calmness, instill confidence and build up the spirit of the body, so that patients do not need to take so many painkillers. In China, they have many meditation programmes which are used to treat cancer. MENINGITIS Chinese Medicine herbal treatment for meningitis has been very successful in China. In the recent past there were many epidemics, particularly in the north, and the hospitals routinely used Chinese herbs as treatment, with a high degree of success. One famous remedy in Chinese Medicine is called White Tiger Decoction, the main ingredients of which are gypsum and rice. These are simple things but they reduce the high fever and clear the infection from the brain. Modern medicine and Chinese Medicine used together is the most effective treatment. END OF QUOTES Ghosh, I am so glad that finally someone explained these things to me, and so logically and simply too. I used to have doubts about the value of TCM for these conditions, but now I am convinced ... so much so that I go on Medline to find the scientific work of Prof Ke. But what, what, what? That is not possible; such a famous professor and no publications? I conclude that my search skills are inadequate and throw myself into studying the plethora of courses Ke offers for the benefit of mankind: Since 2000, Asant\u00e9 Academy has officially collaborated with Middlesex University in running and teaching the BSc and MSc in Traditional Chinese Medicine. - BSc Degrees in Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine - MSc Degree in Chinese Medicine - Professional Practice in Herbal Medicine, Chinese Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture But perhaps this is a bit too arduous; maybe so-called diploma courses suit me better? Personally, I am tempted by the ' [24-day Certificate Course in TCM Acupuncture](http://asante-academy.com/courses-open-days/24-day-certificate-course-in-tcm-acupuncture/)' - it's a bargain, just \u00a3 2,880! PS Prof Ke, if you read these lines, would you please tell us where and when you got your professorship? Your otherwise ostentatious website seems to fail to disclose this detail. "}
