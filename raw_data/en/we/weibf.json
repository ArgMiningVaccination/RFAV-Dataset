Some males mark their territory inside your house by urinating on walls and furniture, a behavior that can be difficult to thwart. Males may fight with other males, especially other male Pit Bulls.\\r\\n\\r\\nFemales, too, can fight with each other, especially other females, but are somewhat less likely to do so. Their main drawback is that they come in <em>estrus</em> (also known as <em>season</em> or <em>heat)</em> twice a year. Estrus lasts for three weeks. Neutering usually solves the marking and estrus problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nTry to choose the best Pit pup, with the best parents and grandparents, you can find. If looks are important to you, be sure they have the look you like. Consider the essentials of the Pit Bull standard. The Pit Bull is a grand athlete, a combination of lithe movement and rippling musculature. The Pit Bull should give the impression of strength, agility, speed, and stamina, without sacrificing one for another.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">If you plan to show your dog, have somebody familiar with the Pit Bull standard come with you and evaluate the ancestors and puppies. If you don't plan to show, simply go with what pleases your Noland<br /><br />All puppies are cute. Take care to choose the one that's best for you.[/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\nA good temperament is important in any breed, but even more so for Pit Bulls. This is why it's best if you can meet the family beforehand. The adult Pit Bull should display a great joy of life, enthusiasm for adventure, desire to please, and courage in the face of adversity. Above any of these traits are the abilities to control herself around strange dogs, the ability to calm down when asked to do so, and the ability to demonstrate no signs of aggression whatsoever. Walk away from litters from parents showing any hint of aggression.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese same traits should be evident in the puppy you choose. The puppy who comes to greet you, tends to follow you around, and doesn't object to being held occasionally is your best choice for a stable companion. Any puppy who shows dog aggression\u2014beyond the typical mild and short skirmish over a toy\u2014should be off your list. Any puppy who shows aggression toward people beyond the typical mouthing and playing should be off your list. Be sure that the breeder interacts with the pups with kindness; early experiences can have lifelong consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nHealth is another huge factor. Your pup has a better chance of living a long, healthy life if her relatives have also had long and healthy lives. Ask how old the parents are and how long the grandparents or great-grandparents lived. If the breeder doesn't have this information, it's a sign he isn't well versed in the litter's pedigree.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsk about hip dysplasia clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). If the breeder has no idea what you're talking about, it's a sign that he isn't well educated about dog breeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nPit Bulls have the 26th highest hip dysplasia percentage out of 181 breeds evaluated by the OFA, with 77 percent having normal hips. (For comparison, the American Staffordshire is ranked 24th worst with 71 percent normal hips, and the American Bully is ranked at 20th worst with only 59 percent normal hips.) The good news is that although their X-rays often show them to be severely dysplastic Pit Bull breeds are less likely to be bothered by it. Good hip ratings lessen the chance that your puppy will develop dysplasia, but they're no guarantee your pup won't develop hip dysplasia as an adult.\\r\\n\\r\\nHip dysplasia isn't the only issue affecting Pit Bulls. Elbow dysplasia is another concern, with only about 80 percent of Pit Bulls having normal elbows. Similarly, hypothyroidism is a concern, with only about 80 percent having normal thyroid function.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canine Health Information Center maintains a list of conditions the various breed parent clubs recommend all prospective parents be tested for. Those suggested for the American Staffordshire Terrier are screenings for hip dysplasia, thyroiditis, cerebellar ataxia hereditary eye better, they maintain a <a href=\\\"http://www.ofa.org/browse-by-breed\\\">list of all AmStaffs that have tested clear</a> of these diseases. Access this list, click your breed of interest, and click Search on the breed's page. This is a great tool to see how involved your potential breeder may be with health testing, and it's one indication of how much they care about producing healthy dogs.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Even the most carefully bred and chosen pup may not develop as hoped concerning conformation, temperament, or health. Discuss with the breeder what, if any guarantees are provided, and consider whether you can handle returning a pup to whom you've become attached if that is part of the bargain. If having a successful competition dog is of vital importance to you, consider buying an adult who has already shown potential.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Most Pit Bulls come from friends and neighbors who have a litter and are either giving them away or selling them for a few hundred dollars to help make ends meet. The breeders have never heard of standards, competitions, health testing or socialization. Others come from local breeders who constantly have puppies available, but, again, think health testing only means the puppy is vaccinated and wormed. Getting a puppy from these people is sort of like having your neighbor fix your airplane because he's good at fixing cars. It might go well . . . or it might not.</p>\\r\\nLet's look at some other very important things good breeders provide: constant advice, mentorship, and a safety net. Bad breeders cash your check, hand you the puppy, and wave good-bye. They're eager for the little eating machines to be gone. But after all, how much hand-holding did you really expect for $200? Good breeders charge more, but part of that pays for lifelong advice from an expert whenever you need it. And, good breeders will demand that should a problem arise with the dog, they be contacted before you make any major decisions, and especially provide that you must return the dog to them rather than relinquish it to a shelter or give her away. They're concerned about that puppy's welfare for the rest of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat sort of questions did the breeder ask you? They should ask at a minimum: why you want a Pit Bull; if you have experience with Pit Bull ownership; what's your history with other dogs you've owned; whether you rent or own your home; and if you rent, if you have the landlord's permission to own a Pit Bull; what other pets you own; what age children are in the house; if you have a fenced yard; and where you plan to exercise the dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a breeder fails to ask you such questions, they don't care about the fates of their puppies, and aren't the kind of breeder you want.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">Pit Bull pups require constant attention, careful supervision, and endless work. Consider whether you will have the time and energy to devote to a puppy. If not, consider getting an older dog from a breeder or rescue group.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">One of the many Pit Bull perks is that adults maintain their puppy playfulness for many years. If you have children, an older Pit Bull may be less likely to bowl them over with her exuberance. She will either be housebroken or be very easy to housebreak. She will have less tendency to chew. And don't worry: She'll bond to you as though she had always owned you. Oops, as if you had always owned her.</p>\\r\\nYou may find that the best way to ensure many years of pleasure is to start with an adult Pit Bull. Of course, you still have to do your part by providing the best care possible. Acquiring an <a href=\\\"https://www.dummies.com/pets/dogs/how-to-help-pit-bulls-age-well/\\\">older Pit Bull</a> comes with its own caveats, however.\",\"description\":\"Both Pit Bull males and females make equally good companions. <a href=\\\"https://www.dummies.com/pets/dogs/pit-bulls-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/\\\">Pit Bull</a> males are slightly larger than females.

Their main drawback is that they come in <em>estrus</em> (also known as <em>season</em> or <em>heat)</em> twice a year. Estrus lasts for three weeks. Neutering usually solves the marking and estrus problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nTry to choose the best Pit pup, with the best parents and grandparents, you can find. If looks are important to you, be sure they have the look you like. Consider the essentials of the Pit Bull standard. The Pit Bull is a grand athlete, a combination of lithe movement and rippling musculature. The Pit Bull should give the impression of strength, agility, speed, and stamina, without sacrificing one for another.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">If you plan to show your dog, have somebody familiar with the Pit Bull standard come with you and evaluate the ancestors and puppies. If you don't plan to show, simply go with what pleases your Noland<br /><br />All puppies are cute. Take care to choose the one that's best for you.[/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\nA good temperament is important in any breed, but even more so for Pit Bulls. This is why it's best if you can meet the family beforehand. The adult Pit Bull should display a great joy of life, enthusiasm for adventure, desire to please, and courage in the face of adversity. Above any of these traits are the abilities to control herself around strange dogs, the ability to calm down when asked to do so, and the ability to demonstrate no signs of aggression whatsoever. Walk away from litters from parents showing any hint of aggression.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese same traits should be evident in the puppy you choose. The puppy who comes to greet you, tends to follow you around, and doesn't object to being held occasionally is your best choice for a stable companion. Any puppy who shows dog aggression\u2014beyond the typical mild and short skirmish over a toy\u2014should be off your list. Any puppy who shows aggression toward people beyond the typical mouthing and playing should be off your list. Be sure that the breeder interacts with the pups with kindness; early experiences can have lifelong consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nHealth is another huge factor. Your pup has a better chance of living a long, healthy life if her relatives have also had long and healthy lives. Ask how old the parents are and how long the grandparents or great-grandparents lived. If the breeder doesn't have this information, it's a sign he isn't well versed in the litter's pedigree.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsk about hip dysplasia clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). If the breeder has no idea what you're talking about, it's a sign that he isn't well educated about dog breeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nPit Bulls have the 26th highest hip dysplasia percentage out of 181 breeds evaluated by the OFA, with 77 percent having normal hips. (For comparison, the American Staffordshire is ranked 24th worst with 71 percent normal hips, and the American Bully is ranked at 20th worst with only 59 percent normal hips.) The good news is that although their X-rays often show them to be severely dysplastic Pit Bull breeds are less likely to be bothered by it. Good hip ratings lessen the chance that your puppy will develop dysplasia, but they're no guarantee your pup won't develop hip dysplasia as an adult.\\r\\n\\r\\nHip dysplasia isn't the only issue affecting Pit Bulls. Elbow dysplasia is another concern, with only about 80 percent of Pit Bulls having normal elbows. Similarly, hypothyroidism is a concern, with only about 80 percent having normal thyroid function.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canine Health Information Center maintains a list of conditions the various breed parent clubs recommend all prospective parents be tested for. Those suggested for the American Staffordshire Terrier are screenings for hip dysplasia, thyroiditis, cerebellar ataxia hereditary eye better, they maintain a <a href=\\\"http://www.ofa.org/browse-by-breed\\\">list of all AmStaffs that have tested clear</a> of these diseases. Access this list, click your breed of interest, and click Search on the breed's page. This is a great tool to see how involved your potential breeder may be with health testing, and it's one indication of how much they care about producing healthy dogs.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Even the most carefully bred and chosen pup may not develop as hoped concerning conformation, temperament, or health. Discuss with the breeder what, if any guarantees are provided, and consider whether you can handle returning a pup to whom you've become attached if that is part of the bargain. If having a successful competition dog is of vital importance to you, consider buying an adult who has already shown potential.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Most Pit Bulls come from friends and neighbors who have a litter and are either giving them away or selling them for a few hundred dollars to help make ends meet. The breeders have never heard of standards, competitions, health testing or socialization. Others come from local breeders who constantly have puppies available, but, again, think health testing only means the puppy is vaccinated and wormed. Getting a puppy from these people is sort of like having your neighbor fix your airplane because he's good at fixing cars. It might go well . . . or it might not.</p>\\r\\nLet's look at some other very important things good breeders provide: constant advice, mentorship, and a safety net. Bad breeders cash your check, hand you the puppy, and wave good-bye. They're eager for the little eating machines to be gone. But after all, how much hand-holding did you really expect for $200? Good breeders charge more, but part of that pays for lifelong advice from an expert whenever you need it. And, good breeders will demand that should a problem arise with the dog, they be contacted before you make any major decisions, and especially provide that you must return the dog to them rather than relinquish it to a shelter or give her away. They're concerned about that puppy's welfare for the rest of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat sort of questions did the breeder ask you? They should ask at a minimum: why you want a Pit Bull; if you have experience with Pit Bull ownership; what's your history with other dogs you've owned; whether you rent or own your home; and if you rent, if you have the landlord's permission to own a Pit Bull; what other pets you own; what age children are in the house; if you have a fenced yard; and where you plan to exercise the dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a breeder fails to ask you such questions, they don't care about the fates of their puppies, and aren't the kind of breeder you want.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">Pit Bull pups require constant attention, careful supervision, and endless work. Consider whether you will have the time and energy to devote to a puppy. If not, consider getting an older dog from a breeder or rescue group.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">One of the many Pit Bull perks is that adults maintain their puppy playfulness for many years. If you have children, an older Pit Bull may be less likely to bowl them over with her exuberance. She will either be housebroken or be very easy to housebreak. She will have less tendency to chew. And don't worry: She'll bond to you as though she had always owned you. Oops, as if you had always owned her.</p>\\r\\nYou may find that the best way to ensure many years of pleasure is to start with an adult Pit Bull. Of course, you still have to do your part by providing the best care possible.

What if you can't handle your dog? What if he pulls you off your feet when you go for a walk, bowls over your grandma, incessantly escapes, or goes after other dogs? What if you want to move to an apartment building that doesn't allow dogs, get married, have a child, or have other life changes that make keeping a dog difficult? These are things to consider now, before you get a dog, rather than later.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pit Bull Rescue pages on social media are filled with such tales of woe. Sometimes the dog is at fault; sometimes he isn't. But regardless, the situation is heartbreaking for everyone involved.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">Before getting a Pit Bull, or any dog at all, ask yourself if you have the time, money, facilities, and energy to deal with a dog for the next 12 years or so. A dog is a lifetime commitment. Most adult dogs never find a second home; the situation is even more dire for adult Pit Bulls. Don't get a Pit Bull just for today; get one for all your tomorrows together. And before you search for your soulmate, do some serious soul searching.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab1\\\" >Making a commitment</h2>\\r\\nAsk yourself if you can handle a strong dog who enjoys and needs lots of exercise. Pit Bulls love to play. They love to exercise their bodies, their minds, and their senses of humor. Good Pit Bull owners share this sense of fun and are eager to join their dogs on a daily adventure\u2014whether it's a run in the park, a game in the yard, or a jog around the neighborhood. If you think it's fun\u2014and it involves activity\u2014chances are your Pit Bull will think it's fun, too. If the idea of physical exertion horrifies you, think twice before inviting a personal fitness your home.\\r\\n\\r\\n[caption id=\\\"attachment_275342\\\" /> These pups will grow up to be strong dogs who will need lots of exercise.[/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\nYou need to exercise your dog's mind as well as his body. Training your Pit Bull not only tires out his brain, but it also results in a dog who is a credit to his breed. For some breeds, training is a nice option; for Pit Bulls, it is a necessity. They are too smart, too powerful, and too active to be without a leader. A poorly trained Pit Bull is an opportunity for the public to condemn \"those incorrigible beasts and their irresponsible owners.\" A well-trained Pit Bull shows these people just how wrong they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nPit Bulls are geniuses and \u2014 like many gifted children \u2014 are prone to get into trouble with their great ideas. Add the Pit Bull's sense of humor, and you have a combination of a stand-up comedian and crazed inventor running through your house. Most of the Pit Bull's pranks are harmless and provide a great floor show, but a few are bound to go astray. Pit Bull owners need to have a very good sense of humor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll dogs are expensive to keep. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) estimates it costs an average of about $1,500 to take care of a puppy during her first year. Pit Bulls are among the healthiest and hardiest of breeds, but even so, expect to spend a lot of money at the veterinarian's office.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour dog will need vaccinations, deworming, probably heartworm prevention, and neutering or spaying. He will occasionally get sick or be injured. Pit Bulls get sick less often than most breeds, but they may get injured more often. Their disregard for danger and total immersion in every activity means they've been known to jump off rooftops after balls, fall out of trees they've climbed, race trains, tackle wild animals too tough even for a Pit Bull, and jump so wildly they damage their legs. Accident prevention will save you money in the long run, besides saving your dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs muscular, active dogs, Pit Bulls need quality fuel to keep them going. The average Pit Bull eats about 20 pounds of food each month. Active dogs (or dogs who spend a lot of time outside in cold weather) need more than that \u2014 and growing dogs need even more.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all dogs, your Pit Bull will need a place in the house he can call his own and a secure yard. Some people \u2014 who want their dog to function as a guard dog \u2014 reason that letting him sleep inside will spoil him for his duties, but your dog is far more likely to guard his family if he actually knows who his family is. The truth of the matter, however, is that if you want a guard dog, you would be better off with another breed! Most Pit Bulls are more likely to maul a burglar by licking him to death than by attacking him.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">If your dog will spend a good deal of time outside, you must provide him with a warm shelter in the winter, shade in the summer, and a fenced-in yard year-round. And when I say a \"fenced-in yard,\" I don't mean the average fenced-in yard. You know those jaw-dropping feats of strength and agility that make you proud of your Pit Bull? The ones where he can climb trees and scale walls and muscle through barriers? He's just as proud to apply those insane skills to your fence.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">Pit Bulls (especially bored Pit Bulls) are escape artists. And their escapes can lead them to their deaths. Loose dogs can be hit by cars, stolen, or taken to the pound \u2014 some are even killed by alarmists who think that a \"savage\" Pit Bull is on the loose. And as much as I hate to admit it, loose Pit Bulls have too often killed other pets and even people. Letting your Pit Bull run free is one of the dumbest things you can do.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >Making the match</h2>\\r\\nSometimes, people expect the impossible when choosing a breed. They want a dog who sleeps when they do, plays when they want to play, protects them against bad guys, introduces them to handsome strangers, barks to warn of drowning children, stays quiet when the news is on, never gets sick, doesn't eat much, looks impressive, takes up no room, never messes things up, and never sheds. No such dog exists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pit Bull is moderately active and very playful. He's protective\u2014sort of. He barks, but not excessively. He is impressive looking and comes in a wide size range. Most Pits are around 17 to 19 inches tall and weigh about 55 to 70 pounds, but some dogs can weigh as little as 30 pounds or as much as 100 pounds. As rambunctious, happy dogs, they sometimes create a trail of destruction when kept in small quarters. Most often, the destruction is caused by their wildly wagging tail that clears coffee tables in a single sweep. And although their coat is very short, Pit Bulls, like almost all dogs, shed.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">You may meet similarly minded people through your dog, but you'll also be avoided by those who don't trust the breed. And there's some merit to their distrust, so if you share your home with children or even vulnerable adults, Pit Bulls may not be your ideal match.</p>\\r\\nPit Bulls are a delightful mixture of exuberance and serenity, obedience and mischief, challenges and rewards \u2014 topped off with a sense of humor, loyalty, and gameness. Their athletic bodies can't help but elicit admiration. They are the perfect pet for many families\u2014but not for every family.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Almost all Pit Bulls share common characteristics. Whether these features are positive aspects of the dog's personality or major hindrances to the owner getting along with the pet depends on whom the Pit Bull lives with. Pit Bulls are special\u2014and they need special people.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">Read the following table to see if a Pit Bull is for you.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<table>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td width=\\\"213\\\"><strong>A Pit a get-up-and-go kind of person who is up for adventure with a canine accomplice.</td>\\r\\n<td width=\\\"213\\\">You are already overwhelmed with work and you value what little relaxation time you have left.

But their most distinguishing feature is their personality. A Pit Bull's character is as much a signature of his heritage as is his conformation.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Pit Bulls are game. </strong>Gameness, though hard to define, is in essence the quality of pressing on cheerfully and with gusto in the face of adversity. In everyday life, this spirit expresses itself in self-confidence, determination, and a certain <em>joie de vivre.</em> Of course, these very traits can also express themselves as stubbornness when owners attempt to work against, rather than with, their dogs.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Pit Bulls need not be aggressive.</strong> Gameness is not aggressiveness. A non-aggressive dog can be game (for example, he avoids a fight but does not back down if pressed), and an aggressive dog can be ungame (for example, he starts a fight but turns tail if the victim fights back). Some Pit Bulls are aggressive with other dogs. Others are not. Most though, if challenged, will attempt to conquer.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Pit Bulls love to play</strong>. They seem to interpret gameness as a love of games, and here the Pit Bull is master of the game. Pit Bulls are great comedians, and they enjoy playing the clown. Their mixture of playfulness, curiosity, and intelligence sometimes gets them into some wildly humorous situations. Pit Bulls thrive on rough-and-tumble play that challenges both their physique and their psyche.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Pit Bulls are stoic.</strong> They were bred to ignore pain and to keep their wits about them when they were hurt. Just because a dog tolerates rough children doesn't mean they should, nor does it mean they will continue to tolerate them. Don't set your Pit Bull up for failure\u2014or your child up for worse.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Pit Bulls are surprisingly sensitive.</strong> Under the Pit Bull's rowdy exterior beats one of the biggest hearts in the dog world\u2014and one of the most apt to be broken.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Pit Bulls are people pleasers.</strong> What other breed of dog would risk its life time after time at the behest of its owner? This very desire to please has\u2014unfortunately\u2014been at the bottom of some Pit Bull attacks on people. For some Pit Bulls, the only desire that can overpower their urge to befriend strangers is their need to please their masters. If a Pit Bull's master communicates to him that attacking a dog or person is what she desires, an attack can result\u2014and the Pit Bull is the one who ultimately price.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n[caption id=\\\"attachment_275341\\\" align=\\\"alignnone\\\" class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">At her best, today's Pit Bull wears her fighting heritage not as a liability, but as a badge of courage and trustworthiness. Not all Pit Bulls, however, are at their best\u2014and when a Pit Bull is bad, she can be very, very bad. Be sure that your Pit Bull represents the very best that this noble breed has to offer by choosing the very best Pit Bull.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab4\\\" >Facing the Facts</h2>\\r\\nWhen Pit Bulls are good, they are very good. But when they are bad, they can ruin lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nPit Bull owners do their dogs no favor when they ignore or refute the evidence that Pit Bulls are responsible for more disfiguring dog bites and fatalities than any other breed of dog. Understanding and accepting these facts will make you a better Pit Bull owner, so take the time to read this section with an open mind.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">Several groups track dog bites and attacks. Foremost among these are <a href=\\\"http://www.dogsbite.org/\\\">DogsBite.org</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.nationalpitbullvictimawareness.org/\\\">National Pit Bull Victim Awareness</a>. Many Pit Bull advocates dismiss these sites as being biased, but in reality, the sites just report on documented dog bite events and peer-reviewed articles.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tech\\\"><em>Peer-reviewed</em> means an article is stringently critiqued by other scientists in an attempt to find any biases, sampling errors, or statistical problems that could render the results false. Studies that do not pass muster are not published.</p>\\r\\nBasically, every major medical journal that has reported on dog bites and breed has concluded that Pit Bulls are responsible for more serious dog bites than any other breed. For example, they've concluded that Pit Bulls are responsible for more fatalities, more disfigurements, more amputations, more surgeries, more complex wounds, more attacks on family members, more attacks on strangers, more attacks on children, and more attacks on adults than any other breed. A <a href=\\\"http://www.nationalpitbullvictimawareness.org/articles/medical-studies-on-pit-bull\\\">complete list of references and more studies</a> can be found online.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last 20 years have seen a steady rise in fatal Pit Bull attacks. In 2018 and 2019, there were 89 fatal dog attacks in the United States; 66 of the victims (or nearly 75 percent) were killed by Pit Bulls or Pit Bull mixes. In 2018, 283 children were disfigured in dog attacks in the United States and Canada; of these, Pit Bulls accounted for 214 of the attacks. (That was the fifth year in a row that Pit Bulls disfigured more than 200 children.) In 2018, Pit Bulls were also responsible for 358 of the 437 adults disfigured in dog attacks in the United States and Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to statistics kept by DogsBite.org, between 2005 and 2017, dogs killed 433 Americans, and Pit Bulls contributed to 66 percent of these deaths. They killed a higher proportion of adults (72 percent) than any other breed, but they also killed the most people in all age groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, Pit Bulls killed 14,850 dogs and injured another 16,900, according to Animals 24-7. Pit Bulls were responsible for 86 percent of dog fatalities and 88 percent of cat fatalities. Pit Bulls have broken into yards and homes to attack resident pets. In many cases, owners who were walking their dogs have been killed or seriously injured trying to protect their dogs from attacking Pit Bulls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wait, are these high numbers simply because Pit Bulls make up such a high percentage of the dog population? Pit Bulls <em>are</em> popular, but how popular are they? Most Pit Bulls and Pit Bull mixes are unregistered so we can't go by registration statistics. But most estimates place them at making up about 6.5 percent of the dog population of the United States. So, that doesn't account for the high proportion of attacks or fatalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo the dogs who attack do so because they're abused? A veterinary study found that more Pit Bulls are the victims of abuse than any other breed. But many of the dogs who killed their owners were known to be beloved family members who were never treated poorly.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo they attack because they're owned by irresponsible people? It's true that far too many Pit Bulls are owned by people who don't properly contain or control their dogs, and these dogs are often the perpetrators of attacks that occur off the dog owner's property, often when walking down the street. But the statistics from 2005 to 2013 showed that only 25 percent of fatal attacks occurred off the dog owner's property.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it because the Pit Bulls were just acting as guard dogs? Unlikely. Of the 284 fatal pit bull attacks between 2005 and 2017, 149 (or 52 percent) involved killing a family or household member.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">You may think it's odd to have so much information about the dangers of Pit Bulls in a Pit Bull article, but urging people to ignore the dangers associated with a Pit Bull would be irresponsible. Ignoring or denying these dangers will only allow more accidents to happen, giving anti-Pit Bull people more ammunition against the breed.</p>\\r\\nSo, here's the dilemma: About 90 million dogs live in the United States. Of these, about 4.5 million are Pit Bulls. Pit Bulls <em>do</em> account for an inordinately high percentage of serious attacks, injuries, disfigurements, and fatalities. But the majority of Pit Bulls spend their lives not making the news, not killing anyone, and basically being peaceable pets. Most people will spend their lives with their Pit Bulls without <em>ever</em> having a serious aggressive incident. These people will proudly tell you that their dogs might \"lick you to death,\" and they're telling the truth (well, you won't be licked to <em>death,</em> but their Pit Bulls are sweet and affectionate and will never hurt a soul). The vast majority of Pit Bulls are <em>wonderful</em> dogs, especially to their own family.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould we negatively brand a breed because a small percentage (but significantly larger than any other breed) will maim or kill people and pets in the family or community? Or do you accept that a certain number of people and pets will be seriously injured or killed as an acceptable trade-off? Most people value their freedom to own the dog of their choice. But they also value their freedom to walk down the street safely.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you, your family member, or your pet is a victim of a Pit Bull attack, you probably won't think this is an acceptable trade-off at all. But if you're the owner of a loving Pit Bull, you'll feel discriminated against and defensive on behalf of your loyal friend.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Pit Bulls were bred to kill, and to ignore that fact is to put you, your family and friends, strangers, other animals, and even your own Pit Bull and the breed itself in danger.</p>\\r\\nAlthough this section may seem oddly anti-Pit Bull for a Pit Bull article, ignoring what the breed was bred to do or what it's capable of doing doesn't do anyone any favors. When you're deciding if a Pit Bull is right for you, you need to be fully informed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this section has made you rethink your decision to add a Pit Bull to your family, that's good! Not every breed is suited to every family. Pit Bulls are <em>not</em> a good choice for you if any of the following apply:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>You have small children or you're often visited by small children.</strong> Given the number of small children Pit Bulls have killed, if little ones are a regular part of your landscape, you should look for another breed.

And that goes twice as much for a Pit Bull. Because of the number of <a href=\\\"https://www.dummies.com/pets/dogs/pit-bulls-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/\\\">Pit Bulls</a> in shelters and rescues, and the number who will never make it back out, you owe it to any dog you get to make sure it's a lifelong commitment\u2014and that means making sure that a Pit Bull is right for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nPit Bulls are strong dogs, and some are aggressive. What if you can't handle your dog? What if he pulls you off your feet when you go for a walk, bowls over your grandma, incessantly escapes, or goes after other dogs? What if you want to move to an apartment building that doesn't allow dogs, get married, have a child, or have other life changes that make keeping a dog difficult? These are things to consider now, before you get a dog, rather than later.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pit Bull Rescue pages on social media are filled with such tales of woe. Sometimes the dog is at fault; sometimes he isn't. But regardless, the situation is heartbreaking for everyone involved.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">Before getting a Pit Bull, or any dog at all, ask yourself if you have the time, money, facilities, and energy to deal with a dog for the next 12 years or so. A dog is a lifetime commitment. Most adult dogs never find a second home; the situation is even more dire for adult Pit Bulls. Don't get a Pit Bull just for today; get one for all your tomorrows together. And before you search for your soulmate, do some serious soul searching.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab1\\\" >Making a commitment</h2>\\r\\nAsk yourself if you can handle a strong dog who enjoys and needs lots of exercise. Pit Bulls love to play. They love to exercise their bodies, their minds, and their senses of humor. Good Pit Bull owners share this sense of fun and are eager to join their dogs on a daily adventure\u2014whether it's a run in the park, a game in the yard, or a jog around the neighborhood. If you think it's fun\u2014and it involves activity\u2014chances are your Pit Bull will think it's fun, too. If the idea of physical exertion horrifies you, think twice before inviting a personal fitness your home.\\r\\n\\r\\n[caption id=\\\"attachment_275342\\\" /> These pups will grow up to be strong dogs who will need lots of exercise.[/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\nYou need to exercise your dog's mind as well as his body. Training your Pit Bull not only tires out his brain, but it also results in a dog who is a credit to his breed. For some breeds, training is a nice option; for Pit Bulls, it is a necessity. They are too smart, too powerful, and too active to be without a leader. A poorly trained Pit Bull is an opportunity for the public to condemn \"those incorrigible beasts and their irresponsible owners.\" A well-trained Pit Bull shows these people just how wrong they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nPit Bulls are geniuses and \u2014 like many gifted children \u2014 are prone to get into trouble with their great ideas. Add the Pit Bull's sense of humor, and you have a combination of a stand-up comedian and crazed inventor running through your house. Most of the Pit Bull's pranks are harmless and provide a great floor show, but a few are bound to go astray. Pit Bull owners need to have a very good sense of humor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll dogs are expensive to keep. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) estimates it costs an average of about $1,500 to take care of a puppy during her first year. Pit Bulls are among the healthiest and hardiest of breeds, but even so, expect to spend a lot of money at the veterinarian's office.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour dog will need vaccinations, deworming, probably heartworm prevention, and neutering or spaying. He will occasionally get sick or be injured. Pit Bulls get sick less often than most breeds, but they may get injured more often. Their disregard for danger and total immersion in every activity means they've been known to jump off rooftops after balls, fall out of trees they've climbed, race trains, tackle wild animals too tough even for a Pit Bull, and jump so wildly they damage their legs. Accident prevention will save you money in the long run, besides saving your dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs muscular, active dogs, Pit Bulls need quality fuel to keep them going. The average Pit Bull eats about 20 pounds of food each month. Active dogs (or dogs who spend a lot of time outside in cold weather) need more than that \u2014 and growing dogs need even more.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all dogs, your Pit Bull will need a place in the house he can call his own and a secure yard. Some people \u2014 who want their dog to function as a guard dog \u2014 reason that letting him sleep inside will spoil him for his duties, but your dog is far more likely to guard his family if he actually knows who his family is. The truth of the matter, however, is that if you want a guard dog, you would be better off with another breed! Most Pit Bulls are more likely to maul a burglar by licking him to death than by attacking him.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">If your dog will spend a good deal of time outside, you must provide him with a warm shelter in the winter, shade in the summer, and a fenced-in yard year-round. And when I say a \"fenced-in yard,\" I don't mean the average fenced-in yard. You know those jaw-dropping feats of strength and agility that make you proud of your Pit Bull? The ones where he can climb trees and scale walls and muscle through barriers? He's just as proud to apply those insane skills to your fence.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">Pit Bulls (especially bored Pit Bulls) are escape artists. And their escapes can lead them to their deaths. Loose dogs can be hit by cars, stolen, or taken to the pound \u2014 some are even killed by alarmists who think that a \"savage\" Pit Bull is on the loose. And as much as I hate to admit it, loose Pit Bulls have too often killed other pets and even people. Letting your Pit Bull run free is one of the dumbest things you can do.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >Making the match</h2>\\r\\nSometimes, people expect the impossible when choosing a breed. They want a dog who sleeps when they do, plays when they want to play, protects them against bad guys, introduces them to handsome strangers, barks to warn of drowning children, stays quiet when the news is on, never gets sick, doesn't eat much, looks impressive, takes up no room, never messes things up, and never sheds. No such dog exists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pit Bull is moderately active and very playful. He's protective\u2014sort of. He barks, but not excessively. He is impressive looking and comes in a wide size range. Most Pits are around 17 to 19 inches tall and weigh about 55 to 70 pounds, but some dogs can weigh as little as 30 pounds or as much as 100 pounds. As rambunctious, happy dogs, they sometimes create a trail of destruction when kept in small quarters. Most often, the destruction is caused by their wildly wagging tail that clears coffee tables in a single sweep. And although their coat is very short, Pit Bulls, like almost all dogs, shed.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">You may meet similarly minded people through your dog, but you'll also be avoided by those who don't trust the breed. And there's some merit to their distrust, so if you share your home with children or even vulnerable adults, Pit Bulls may not be your ideal match.</p>\\r\\nPit Bulls are a delightful mixture of exuberance and serenity, obedience and mischief, challenges and rewards \u2014 topped off with a sense of humor, loyalty, and gameness. Their athletic bodies can't help but elicit admiration. They are the perfect pet for many families\u2014but not for every family.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Almost all Pit Bulls share common characteristics. Whether these features are positive aspects of the dog's personality or major hindrances to the owner getting along with the pet depends on whom the Pit Bull lives with. Pit Bulls are special\u2014and they need special people.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">Read the following table to see if a Pit Bull is for you.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<table>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td width=\\\"213\\\"><strong>A Pit a get-up-and-go kind of person who is up for adventure with a canine accomplice.</td>\\r\\n<td width=\\\"213\\\">You are already overwhelmed with work and you value what little relaxation time you have left.

But their most distinguishing feature is their personality. A Pit Bull's character is as much a signature of his heritage as is his conformation.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Pit Bulls are game. </strong>Gameness, though hard to define, is in essence the quality of pressing on cheerfully and with gusto in the face of adversity. In everyday life, this spirit expresses itself in self-confidence, determination, and a certain <em>joie de vivre.</em> Of course, these very traits can also express themselves as stubbornness when owners attempt to work against, rather than with, their dogs.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Pit Bulls need not be aggressive.</strong> Gameness is not aggressiveness. A non-aggressive dog can be game (for example, he avoids a fight but does not back down if pressed), and an aggressive dog can be ungame (for example, he starts a fight but turns tail if the victim fights back). Some Pit Bulls are aggressive with other dogs. Others are not. Most though, if challenged, will attempt to conquer.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Pit Bulls love to play</strong>. They seem to interpret gameness as a love of games, and here the Pit Bull is master of the game. Pit Bulls are great comedians, and they enjoy playing the clown. Their mixture of playfulness, curiosity, and intelligence sometimes gets them into some wildly humorous situations. Pit Bulls thrive on rough-and-tumble play that challenges both their physique and their psyche.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Pit Bulls are stoic.</strong> They were bred to ignore pain and to keep their wits about them when they were hurt. Just because a dog tolerates rough children doesn't mean they should, nor does it mean they will continue to tolerate them. Don't set your Pit Bull up for failure\u2014or your child up for worse.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Pit Bulls are surprisingly sensitive.</strong> Under the Pit Bull's rowdy exterior beats one of the biggest hearts in the dog world\u2014and one of the most apt to be broken.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Pit Bulls are people pleasers.</strong> What other breed of dog would risk its life time after time at the behest of its owner? This very desire to please has\u2014unfortunately\u2014been at the bottom of some Pit Bull attacks on people. For some Pit Bulls, the only desire that can overpower their urge to befriend strangers is their need to please their masters. If a Pit Bull's master communicates to him that attacking a dog or person is what she desires, an attack can result\u2014and the Pit Bull is the one who ultimately price.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n[caption id=\\\"attachment_275341\\\" align=\\\"alignnone\\\" class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">At her best, today's Pit Bull wears her fighting heritage not as a liability, but as a badge of courage and trustworthiness. Not all Pit Bulls, however, are at their best\u2014and when a Pit Bull is bad, she can be very, very bad. Be sure that your Pit Bull represents the very best that this noble breed has to offer by choosing the very best Pit Bull.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab4\\\" >Facing the Facts</h2>\\r\\nWhen Pit Bulls are good, they are very good. But when they are bad, they can ruin lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nPit Bull owners do their dogs no favor when they ignore or refute the evidence that Pit Bulls are responsible for more disfiguring dog bites and fatalities than any other breed of dog. Understanding and accepting these facts will make you a better Pit Bull owner, so take the time to read this section with an open mind.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">Several groups track dog bites and attacks. Foremost among these are <a href=\\\"http://www.dogsbite.org/\\\">DogsBite.org</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.nationalpitbullvictimawareness.org/\\\">National Pit Bull Victim Awareness</a>. Many Pit Bull advocates dismiss these sites as being biased, but in reality, the sites just report on documented dog bite events and peer-reviewed articles.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tech\\\"><em>Peer-reviewed</em> means an article is stringently critiqued by other scientists in an attempt to find any biases, sampling errors, or statistical problems that could render the results false. Studies that do not pass muster are not published.</p>\\r\\nBasically, every major medical journal that has reported on dog bites and breed has concluded that Pit Bulls are responsible for more serious dog bites than any other breed. For example, they've concluded that Pit Bulls are responsible for more fatalities, more disfigurements, more amputations, more surgeries, more complex wounds, more attacks on family members, more attacks on strangers, more attacks on children, and more attacks on adults than any other breed. A <a href=\\\"http://www.nationalpitbullvictimawareness.org/articles/medical-studies-on-pit-bull\\\">complete list of references and more studies</a> can be found online.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last 20 years have seen a steady rise in fatal Pit Bull attacks. In 2018 and 2019, there were 89 fatal dog attacks in the United States; 66 of the victims (or nearly 75 percent) were killed by Pit Bulls or Pit Bull mixes. In 2018, 283 children were disfigured in dog attacks in the United States and Canada; of these, Pit Bulls accounted for 214 of the attacks. (That was the fifth year in a row that Pit Bulls disfigured more than 200 children.) In 2018, Pit Bulls were also responsible for 358 of the 437 adults disfigured in dog attacks in the United States and Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to statistics kept by DogsBite.org, between 2005 and 2017, dogs killed 433 Americans, and Pit Bulls contributed to 66 percent of these deaths. They killed a higher proportion of adults (72 percent) than any other breed, but they also killed the most people in all age groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, Pit Bulls killed 14,850 dogs and injured another 16,900, according to Animals 24-7. Pit Bulls were responsible for 86 percent of dog fatalities and 88 percent of cat fatalities. Pit Bulls have broken into yards and homes to attack resident pets. In many cases, owners who were walking their dogs have been killed or seriously injured trying to protect their dogs from attacking Pit Bulls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wait, are these high numbers simply because Pit Bulls make up such a high percentage of the dog population? Pit Bulls <em>are</em> popular, but how popular are they? Most Pit Bulls and Pit Bull mixes are unregistered so we can't go by registration statistics. But most estimates place them at making up about 6.5 percent of the dog population of the United States. So, that doesn't account for the high proportion of attacks or fatalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo the dogs who attack do so because they're abused? A veterinary study found that more Pit Bulls are the victims of abuse than any other breed. But many of the dogs who killed their owners were known to be beloved family members who were never treated poorly.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo they attack because they're owned by irresponsible people? It's true that far too many Pit Bulls are owned by people who don't properly contain or control their dogs, and these dogs are often the perpetrators of attacks that occur off the dog owner's property, often when walking down the street. But the statistics from 2005 to 2013 showed that only 25 percent of fatal attacks occurred off the dog owner's property.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it because the Pit Bulls were just acting as guard dogs? Unlikely. Of the 284 fatal pit bull attacks between 2005 and 2017, 149 (or 52 percent) involved killing a family or household member.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">You may think it's odd to have so much information about the dangers of Pit Bulls in a Pit Bull article, but urging people to ignore the dangers associated with a Pit Bull would be irresponsible. Ignoring or denying these dangers will only allow more accidents to happen, giving anti-Pit Bull people more ammunition against the breed.</p>\\r\\nSo, here's the dilemma: About 90 million dogs live in the United States. Of these, about 4.5 million are Pit Bulls. Pit Bulls <em>do</em> account for an inordinately high percentage of serious attacks, injuries, disfigurements, and fatalities. But the majority of Pit Bulls spend their lives not making the news, not killing anyone, and basically being peaceable pets. Most people will spend their lives with their Pit Bulls without <em>ever</em> having a serious aggressive incident. These people will proudly tell you that their dogs might \"lick you to death,\" and they're telling the truth (well, you won't be licked to <em>death,</em> but their Pit Bulls are sweet and affectionate and will never hurt a soul). The vast majority of Pit Bulls are <em>wonderful</em> dogs, especially to their own family.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould we negatively brand a breed because a small percentage (but significantly larger than any other breed) will maim or kill people and pets in the family or community? Or do you accept that a certain number of people and pets will be seriously injured or killed as an acceptable trade-off? Most people value their freedom to own the dog of their choice. But they also value their freedom to walk down the street safely.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you, your family member, or your pet is a victim of a Pit Bull attack, you probably won't think this is an acceptable trade-off at all. But if you're the owner of a loving Pit Bull, you'll feel discriminated against and defensive on behalf of your loyal friend.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Pit Bulls were bred to kill, and to ignore that fact is to put you, your family and friends, strangers, other animals, and even your own Pit Bull and the breed itself in danger.</p>\\r\\nAlthough this section may seem oddly anti-Pit Bull for a Pit Bull article, ignoring what the breed was bred to do or what it's capable of doing doesn't do anyone any favors. When you're deciding if a Pit Bull is right for you, you need to be fully informed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this section has made you rethink your decision to add a Pit Bull to your family, that's good! Not every breed is suited to every family. Pit Bulls are <em>not</em> a good choice for you if any of the following apply:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>You have small children or you're often visited by small children.</strong> Given the number of small children Pit Bulls have killed, if little ones are a regular part of your landscape, you should look for another breed. Yes, many if not most Pit Bulls do fine in families with kids, but why chance it? Your odds of having to deal with dangerous incidents are much lower if you choose another breed.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>You have other dogs or cats. </strong>As a breed created to kill other dogs, Pit Bulls are not the best choice for a multidog household. They're also not good for households with cats or other small animals (like rabbits).

They remain young of body as well\u2014up to a point. While your <a href=\\\"https://www.dummies.com/pets/dogs/pit-bulls-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/\\\">Pit Bull</a> may be active and healthy for a long time, one day you will look at your youngster and be shocked to discover that his face has silvered and his gait has stiffened. He sleeps longer and more soundly than he did as a youngster, and he's slower to get going. He may be less eager to play and more content to lie in the sun. Feeling a bit sad is natural, but getting your dog to a healthy old age is a worthy are as adorable as a mischievous Pit Bull pup discovering the world, or as magnificent as an adult Pit Bull exuding self-confidence, but other Pit Bulls pale in comparison to the wise and stately Pit Bull elder.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder Pit Bulls can enjoy full and active lives, as long as you know what extra measures to take.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Average life expectancy for a Pit Bull is about 11 to 13 years, although many have reached ripe old ages of 15 or 16.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab1\\\" >Eat and run</h2>\\r\\nMany Pit Bull owners have the idea that their macho little dog won't ever slow down with age. But staying in a state of denial about your dog's increasing age or decreasing abilities is not doing him any favors.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder Pit Bulls, who may have had minor joint problems when young, really begin to suffer from them. Keeping your older Pit Bull relatively active, without putting too much stress on his joints, is critical to his health. If your dog is sore the day after you exercise, you've probably asked too much. You may have to walk with your dog and do your marathon running by yourself. Swimming is an excellent low-impact exercise, as long as the dog doesn't get chilled and is never put in a dangerous situation. Remember that exercise is <em>essential</em> to keeping your dog Older Pit Bulls still need an active lifestyle to stay healthy.[/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder dogs should be fed several small meals instead of one large meal, and should be fed on time. Moistening dry food or feeding canned food can help a dog with dental problems enjoy his meal. He may also enjoy eating while lying down or eating off of a raised platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder dogs engage in less physical activity and have lower metabolic rates, so they require fewer calories than they used to. Older dogs who are fed the same amount of food as when they were young can become obese; obese dogs have a greater risk of cardiovascular and joint problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Pit Bulls lose weight with age, which can be as unhealthy as gaining weight. Your dog needs a little bit of padding, so that he has something to fall back on if he gets sick. Consuming high quality (not quantity) protein is especially important for older dogs. The good news is that most older dogs do not require a special diet unless they have a particular medical need for it.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >Act your age</h2>\\r\\nOlder dogs tend to like a simple life. Although they're still up for adventure, that adventure may have to be toned down a bit. Long trips can be grueling for an older dog, and boarding in a kennel may be extremely upsetting. Consider getting a house sitter who your dog knows if you want to go on vacation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome older dogs become cranky and impatient, especially when dealing with puppies or boisterous children. But don't excuse behavioral changes, especially if they're sudden, as entirely due to aging. They could be symptoms of pain or disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe slight haziness that appears in an older dog's pupils is normal and has minimal effect upon vision, but some dogs, especially those with diabetes, may develop cataracts. Cataracts can be seen through the dog's pupils as a densely clouded area. The lens can be removed by a veterinary ophthalmologist if the cataract is severe. Older dogs may experience hearing or visual loss. Be careful not to startle a dog with impaired senses, as a startled dog could snap in self-defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nDogs with gradual vision loss can cope well, as long as they are kept in familiar surroundings and extra safety precautions are followed. For example, don't move furniture, and place sound or scent beacons throughout the house or yard to help the dog locate specific landmarks. Also lay pathways in the yard, such as gravel or block walkways, and even in the house, using carpet runners. Block open stairways or pools. Dogs with hearing loss can learn hand gestures and also respond to vibrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immune system may be less effective in older dogs. As a result, shielding your dog from infectious disease, chilling, overheating, and any other stressful condition is important. A bit of good news: An older dog who's never exposed to other dogs may not need to be vaccinated as often or for as many diseases as a younger dog. Discuss this with your veterinarian.\\r\\n\\r\\nVomiting and diarrhea can signal that an older dog may have various problems; keep in mind that an older dog cannot tolerate the dehydration that results from continued vomiting or diarrhea. You should not let it continue unchecked.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">An older Pit Bull should see the veterinarian at least twice a year. Blood tests can detect early stages of diseases, and your vet may be able to spot developing problems without any tests whatsoever.</p>\\r\\nOlder dogs are somewhat more at risk when they undergo anesthesia. Most of the increased risk can be negated, however, by carefully screening dogs to determine if they're healthy enough to undergo the procedure. Many older dogs need tooth cleaning under anesthesia \u2014 this is generally safe, as long as your dog is healthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder dogs tend to have a stronger body odor. Don't just ignore increased odors, though. They could indicate specific problems, such as periodontal disease, impacted anal sacs, seborrhea, ear infections, or even kidney disease. Any strong odor should be checked by your veterinarian.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike people, dogs lose skin moisture as they age. Although dogs don't have to worry about wrinkles, their skin can become dry and itchy. Regular brushing can help to stimulate oil production.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Pit Bulls of any age enjoy a soft, warm bed, such a bed is an absolute necessity for older Pit Bulls. Arthritis is a common cause of intermittent stiffness and lameness, and it can be helped with heat, a soft bed, moderate exercise, and possibly drug therapy. New arthritis medications have made a huge difference in the quality of life for many older Pit Bulls, but not every dog can use them. Ask your veterinarian to evaluate your dog's ability to take some of the new medicines, if your Pit has arthritis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, any ailment that an older dog has is magnified in severity on account of age. Some of the more common symptoms of illness that an older Pit Bull may display, and the possible causes of the symptoms, include:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Diarrhea:</strong> tumor; periodontal disease</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nIf you're lucky enough to have an older Pit Bull, you must accept that an end will come. Heart disease, kidney failure, and cancer eventually claim most of these senior citizens. Early detection can help delay the effects of these diseases, but, unfortunately, can seldom defeat them.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab3\\\" >When you've done everything</h2>\\r\\nDespite the best of care, a time will come when neither you nor your veterinarian can prevent your dear friend from succumbing to old age or an incurable illness. It seems hard to believe that you will have to bid farewell to an animal who has been such a focal point of your life\u2014in truth, a real member of your family. That dogs live such a short time compared to humans is a cruel fact, but one that you must ultimately face.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should realize that both of you have been fortunate to share so many good times. You must also make sure that your Pit Bull's remaining time is still pleasurable. Many terminal illnesses make your dog feel very ill, and there comes a point when your desire to keep your friend with you for as long as possible may be cruel to both of you. If your dog no longer eats his dinner or treats, he's giving you a sign that he doesn't feel well and you must face the prospect of doing what's best for your beloved friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery Pit Bull owner has to determine when they feel the point has come, using whatever criteria they feel is right. In my opinion, many people put off making the difficult choice for longer than they should and for longer than is kind to the dog. They don't want to act in haste and be haunted by thoughts that, just maybe, the most recent dip into lethargy and illness was a temporary setback. And of course, they put it off because they can't stand the thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nEuthanasia is a difficult and personal decision that no one wishes to make, and no one can make it for you. Ask your veterinarian if there is a reasonable chance of your dog getting better and if your dog is likely suffering. Ask yourself if your dog is getting pleasure out of life, and if he enjoys most of his days. Financial considerations can be a factor too, if you'd have to go into debt to keep your dog alive for just a bit longer. Your own emotional state must also be considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all wish that, if our dog has to go, he could just fall asleep and never wake up. This, unfortunately, almost never happens. Even when it does, you're left with the regret that you never got to say goodbye. The best way you can simulate a natural death is with euthanasia. Euthanasia is painless and involves giving an overdose of an anesthetic. The dog falls asleep and dies almost instantly. In a very sick dog, because the circulation is compromised, it may take slightly longer for the anesthetic to go into effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you do decide that euthanasia is the kindest thing you can do for your beloved friend, discuss with your veterinarian what will happen. You may ask about giving your dog a tranquilizer beforehand, if he's afraid of the vet's office. You may feel better having the doctor meet you at home or if the vet comes out to your car. Although it won't be easy, try to remain with your dog so that his last moments will be filled with your love; otherwise, have a friend whom your dog knows stay with him. Try to recall the wonderful times you've shared, and realize that, however painful losing such a once-in-a-lifetime dog is, it's better than never having had such a partner at all.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab4\\\" >Eternally in your heart</h2>\\r\\nAfter losing such a cherished friend, many people say that they will never get another dog. True, no dog will ever take the place of your dog. But you'll find that another dog is a welcome diversion and will help keep you from dwelling on the loss of your first pet, as long as you don't keep comparing the new dog to the old. It's true that by getting another dog you're sentencing yourself to the same grief in the future, but wouldn't you rather have that than miss out on a second once-in-a-lifetime dog?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of your companion may mark the end of an era for you, a time when you and your Pit Bull grew up or grew old together. But one could scarcely ask for a better life partner than a special Pit Bull. As long as you hold your memories close, your relationship with your dog will last forever.\",\"description\":\"Pit Bulls are the Peter Pans (well, maybe if Peter Pan were a wrestler) of the dog world, eternally young at heart. They remain young of body as well\u2014up to a point. While your <a href=\\\"https://www.dummies.com/pets/dogs/pit-bulls-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/\\\">Pit Bull</a> may be active and healthy for a long time, one day you will look at your youngster and be shocked to discover that his face has silvered and his gait has stiffened. He sleeps longer and more soundly than he did as a youngster, and he's slower to get going. He may be less eager to play and more content to lie in the sun. Feeling a bit sad is natural, but getting your dog to a healthy old age is a worthy are as adorable as a mischievous Pit Bull pup discovering the world, or as magnificent as an adult Pit Bull exuding self-confidence, but other Pit Bulls pale in comparison to the wise and stately Pit Bull elder.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder Pit Bulls can enjoy full and active lives, as long as you know what extra measures to take.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Average life expectancy for a Pit Bull is about 11 to 13 years, although many have reached ripe old ages of 15 or 16.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab1\\\" >Eat and run</h2>\\r\\nMany Pit Bull owners have the idea that their macho little dog won't ever slow down with age. But staying in a state of denial about your dog's increasing age or decreasing abilities is not doing him any favors.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder Pit Bulls, who may have had minor joint problems when young, really begin to suffer from them. Keeping your older Pit Bull relatively active, without putting too much stress on his joints, is critical to his health. If your dog is sore the day after you exercise, you've probably asked too much. You may have to walk with your dog and do your marathon running by yourself. Swimming is an excellent low-impact exercise, as long as the dog doesn't get chilled and is never put in a dangerous situation. Remember that exercise is <em>essential</em> to keeping your dog Older Pit Bulls still need an active lifestyle to stay healthy.[/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder dogs should be fed several small meals instead of one large meal, and should be fed on time. Moistening dry food or feeding canned food can help a dog with dental problems enjoy his meal. He may also enjoy eating while lying down or eating off of a raised platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder dogs engage in less physical activity and have lower metabolic rates, so they require fewer calories than they used to. Older dogs who are fed the same amount of food as when they were young can become obese; obese dogs have a greater risk of cardiovascular and joint problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Pit Bulls lose weight with age, which can be as unhealthy as gaining weight. Your dog needs a little bit of padding, so that he has something to fall back on if he gets sick. Consuming high quality (not quantity) protein is especially important for older dogs. The good news is that most older dogs do not require a special diet unless they have a particular medical need for it.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >Act your age</h2>\\r\\nOlder dogs tend to like a simple life. Although they're still up for adventure, that adventure may have to be toned down a bit. Long trips can be grueling for an older dog, and boarding in a kennel may be extremely upsetting. Consider getting a house sitter who your dog knows if you want to go on vacation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome older dogs become cranky and impatient, especially when dealing with puppies or boisterous children.

Other groups call Pit Bulls maulers (and a host of other words my publisher won't allow me to include here). Neither side is right nor wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that you're reading this article probably means you're a Pit Bull lover, so you're more likely to be swayed by the group that fervently believes Pit Bulls are the victims of discrimination. But that group is also one of the greatest victims of Pit Bull attacks \u2014 because they refuse to see that there is the potential \u2014 not the promise, but the potential \u2014 that this dear family member could one day answer to his heritage and inflict serious injuries to people or pets.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy plea is this: Listen to both sides. Realize that this issue is not black and white. (It isn't even gray. It's more like a marble design, with swirls of truth running throughout both sides.) And act accordingly. Take the extra precautions that old time dogmen took because they realized the potential for danger. Don't give your dog a chance to be a statistic simply because you trusted too much. Be a loving\u2014but careful\u2014custodian who doesn't set your dog up for failure, and in so doing, doesn't bring even more bad attention to the breed.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >Show off</h2>\\r\\nIf you have a Pit Bull who is a great example of what the breed can be, show him off! Train for or enter any competitions: weight-pulling, agility, dock diving, obedience, rally, tracking, scent work, barn hunt, trick dog, canine good citizen. If your Pit Bull performs with typical Bully enthusiasm, you can be sure she'll be making a good impression on everyone there!\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab3\\\" >Be considerate</h2>\\r\\nMany people will be uneasy having your Pit Bull around their child or pet. Don't blame them for these feelings. Instead, try to understand that, statistically, they have cause for concern. Your job is to set their fears at ease, not confront or antagonize them. Keep your dog on a sturdy leash in public, close to your side, and don't allow him to stare at or threaten other people or pets. I know, I know: Your Pit Bull is a sweetheart. But they don't know that. Prove them wrong. Don't feed into the stereotype of the inconsiderate Pit Bull owner.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab4\\\" >Steer your dog away from trouble</h2>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Don't set your dog up for failure. Dog parks are generally just too exciting to take a chance on going. But if you see out-of-control dogs anywhere, just leave. Don't give them the chance to start something with your dog. Your dog may not be the one to start it, but he may be the one to finish it \u2014 and get the blame for the whole thing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab5\\\" >Be realistic</h2>\\r\\nEvery day, I see pleas from Pit Bull owners who can't keep their dogs. They deeply love their dogs, but they can't keep them because they've killed another family pet or threatened their children. They try to find a home without pets or kids, but that's not easy, and it also doesn't protect future neighborhood pets and kids. Some owners, upon realizing there are no takers, decide not to mention their dogs' problems, perhaps in the hopes that the dog will somehow be less aggressive in a new home. The situation is horribly tragic, but placing a potentially dangerous dog where he could injure anyone\u2014human or animal\u2014is not an option.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab6\\\" >Stay optimistic</h2>\\r\\nAlthough Pit Bulls have a higher chance of inflicting severe injury than other breeds do, most Pit Bulls spend their entire lives biting nothing but their dinners! Being aware and careful is not the same as being scared. Have fun with your Pit Bull\u2014there's a reason Pit Bulls are so popular, and it's because most of them are good, and when they <em>are</em> good, they're <em>very</em> good!\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab7\\\" >Explore Search and Rescue</h2>\\r\\nNo machine has been developed that can outperform a dog's nose in olfactory detection or that can outperform a dog when it comes to finding buried, lost, or even dead people. Not every dog is up to the challenge, however. To be a Search and Rescue dog, not only must a dog have a good nose, but he must also be courageous, strong, nimble, obedient, intelligent, enthusiastic, and tough. This sounds like a job for a Pit Bull!\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">Contact the <a href=\\\"http://www.sardogsus.org/\\\">Search and Rescue Dogs of the United States</a> for more information about training for Search and Rescue.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab8\\\" >Organize a local Pit Bull group</h2>\\r\\nSometimes it's difficult to lead your own private crusade, but there's strength in numbers \u2014 and few things are stronger than a group of determined Pit Bull owners. Your group can organize competitions and perhaps even hold sanctioned events under the auspices of the ADBA, UKC, or AKC; you may also conduct Canine Good Citizen tests or Temperament Tests.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab9\\\" >Spread the word</h2>\\r\\nAll your good deeds will be undone if uneducated or uncaring Pit Bull owners let their dogs run amuck. It's difficult to be a one-person crusade, but you may have to show these people the light in order to make the world a better place for Pit Bulls in general and your dog in particular. Perhaps you could write a dog care column for your local paper. Publicize cases of Pit Bull heroism and good deeds. You could volunteer at the local Humane Society and take special care to educate Pit Bull adopters. You could call up classifieds in the paper advertising Pit Bulls and make yourself available to these people or to their puppy buyers for advice. You could pass out Pit Bull information at dog events. Make yourself known in your community as a dedicated and responsible dog owner and lover. Make it difficult for community leaders to say anything bad about Pit Bull owners, because they will think of you first. Remember that your Pit Bull is the best ambassador for the breed you have, but you have to be his PR agent.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab10\\\" >Support the cause</h2>\\r\\nPerhaps being in the public spotlight just isn't for you. You can still do your part by joining a national or international group that fights for dog rights. You can contribute your time, money, or expertise to end dog fighting and animal abuse and fight breed-specific legislation or unjust laws. Dog fighting gives the Pit Bull a bad public image; many other ways exist to test this breed's gameness that don't involve cruel practices or illegal venues.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimal abuse occurs everywhere. It's just as bad if it happens to a mixed breed as to a Pit Bull. Become involved in stopping it, not only because it's the humane thing to do, but because as a Pit Bull owner you have the chance to show that Pit Bull owners care about humane animal care.\\r\\n\\r\\nFight unjust laws no matter where they are or if they affect you or not. Every unfair law that goes unchallenged in another community helps your community leaders to justify passing the same laws where you live. Help people in other communities fight their battles, and they will be there for you.

Train for or enter any competitions: weight-pulling, agility, dock diving, obedience, rally, tracking, scent work, barn hunt, trick dog, canine good citizen. If your Pit Bull performs with typical Bully enthusiasm, you can be sure she'll be making a good impression on everyone there!\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab3\\\" >Be considerate</h2>\\r\\nMany people will be uneasy having your Pit Bull around their child or pet. Don't blame them for these feelings. Instead, try to understand that, statistically, they have cause for concern. Your job is to set their fears at ease, not confront or antagonize them. Keep your dog on a sturdy leash in public, close to your side, and don't allow him to stare at or threaten other people or pets. I know, I know: Your Pit Bull is a sweetheart. But they don't know that. Prove them wrong. Don't feed into the stereotype of the inconsiderate Pit Bull owner.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab4\\\" >Steer your dog away from trouble</h2>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Don't set your dog up for failure. Dog parks are generally just too exciting to take a chance on going. But if you see out-of-control dogs anywhere, just leave. Don't give them the chance to start something with your dog. Your dog may not be the one to start it, but he may be the one to finish it \u2014 and get the blame for the whole thing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab5\\\" >Be realistic</h2>\\r\\nEvery day, I see pleas from Pit Bull owners who can't keep their dogs. They deeply love their dogs, but they can't keep them because they've killed another family pet or threatened their children. They try to find a home without pets or kids, but that's not easy, and it also doesn't protect future neighborhood pets and kids. Some owners, upon realizing there are no takers, decide not to mention their dogs' problems, perhaps in the hopes that the dog will somehow be less aggressive in a new home. The situation is horribly tragic, but placing a potentially dangerous dog where he could injure anyone\u2014human or animal\u2014is not an option.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab6\\\" >Stay optimistic</h2>\\r\\nAlthough Pit Bulls have a higher chance of inflicting severe injury than other breeds do, most Pit Bulls spend their entire lives biting nothing but their dinners! Being aware and careful is not the same as being scared. Have fun with your Pit Bull\u2014there's a reason Pit Bulls are so popular, and it's because most of them are good, and when they <em>are</em> good, they're <em>very</em> good!\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab7\\\" >Explore Search and Rescue</h2>\\r\\nNo machine has been developed that can outperform a dog's nose in olfactory detection or that can outperform a dog when it comes to finding buried, lost, or even dead people. Not every dog is up to the challenge, however. To be a Search and Rescue dog, not only must a dog have a good nose, but he must also be courageous, strong, nimble, obedient, intelligent, enthusiastic, and tough. This sounds like a job for a Pit Bull!\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">Contact the <a href=\\\"http://www.sardogsus.org/\\\">Search and Rescue Dogs of the United States</a> for more information about training for Search and Rescue.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab8\\\" >Organize a local Pit Bull group</h2>\\r\\nSometimes it's difficult to lead your own private crusade, but there's strength in numbers \u2014 and few things are stronger than a group of determined Pit Bull owners. Your group can organize competitions and perhaps even hold sanctioned events under the auspices of the ADBA, UKC, or AKC; you may also conduct Canine Good Citizen tests or Temperament Tests.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab9\\\" >Spread the word</h2>\\r\\nAll your good deeds will be undone if uneducated or uncaring Pit Bull owners let their dogs run amuck. It's difficult to be a one-person crusade, but you may have to show these people the light in order to make the world a better place for Pit Bulls in general and your dog in particular. Perhaps you could write a dog care column for your local paper. Publicize cases of Pit Bull heroism and good deeds. You could volunteer at the local Humane Society and take special care to educate Pit Bull adopters. You could call up classifieds in the paper advertising Pit Bulls and make yourself available to these people or to their puppy buyers for advice. You could pass out Pit Bull information at dog events. Make yourself known in your community as a dedicated and responsible dog owner and lover. Make it difficult for community leaders to say anything bad about Pit Bull owners, because they will think of you first. Remember that your Pit Bull is the best ambassador for the breed you have, but you have to be his PR agent.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab10\\\" >Support the cause</h2>\\r\\nPerhaps being in the public spotlight just isn't for you. You can still do your part by joining a national or international group that fights for dog rights. You can contribute your time, money, or expertise to end dog fighting and animal abuse and fight breed-specific legislation or unjust laws. Dog fighting gives the Pit Bull a bad public image; many other ways exist to test this breed's gameness that don't involve cruel practices or illegal venues.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimal abuse occurs everywhere. It's just as bad if it happens to a mixed breed as to a Pit Bull. Become involved in stopping it, not only because it's the humane thing to do, but because as a Pit Bull owner you have the chance to show that Pit Bull owners care about humane animal care.\\r\\n\\r\\nFight unjust laws no matter where they are or if they affect you or not. Every unfair law that goes unchallenged in another community helps your community leaders to justify passing the same laws where you live. Help people in other communities fight their battles, and they will be there for you.

These misconceptions truly run the gamut: Although some people consider <a href=\\\"https://www.dummies.com/pets/dogs/pit-bulls-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/\\\">Pit Bulls</a> to be the safest and gentlest companions, others regard them as evil enough to be Satan's understudies. Neither viewpoint is correct, but both have some basis in fact \u2014 and in the breed's controversial roots.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab1\\\" >The creation of canine gladiators</h2>\\r\\nDogs and humans around the world have long shared a special relationship \u2014 a relationship originally based on function. Early dogs who proved least useful \u2014 or who were too wild, skittish, or dumb \u2014 probably ended up in the cave man's pot, but the most helpful dogs (who were good at sounding alarms at intruders or at chasing down game) lived to produce others like them. Eventually, breed forerunners were created by breeding the best guards to the best guards and the best hunters to the best hunters. Of these, some strains proved to be especially brave and tough \u2014 valuable traits in a rough world.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, these strains weren't really breeds. Few cave men had American Kennel Club (AKC) or United Kennel Club papers for their dogs, so pure breeding wasn't terribly important to them. Still, with time the strains of dogs became more and more specialized. By classical Greek times, large fierce dogs called <em>Molossians</em> were so valued that Phoenician traders used them as bartering items. Because of this practice, the Molossian type was distributed along Phoenician shipping routes, some of which included stops in ancient Britain. The Molossians who ended up in Britain became further specialized and gave rise to the Mastiff family of dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Britain, Mastiffs were perfected as war dogs. When the Romans invaded Britain, they were so impressed by the Mastiff's warring ability that they brought some back to Rome. Romans valued entertainment, and the courageous dogs became infamous as gladiators who fought humans, bears, lions, bulls, and even each other in Rome's great Coliseum.\\r\\n\\r\\nRome was not, however, the only civilization to revel in blood sports. The British, too, placed high value on contests that featured animals fighting to the death. The spectacle of a dog killing a bull was the highest entertainment that most small villages could offer its poor inhabitants. But this kind of entertainment spanned all classes: By the 16th century, bull-, bear-, and even horse-baiting provided the finale for a royal evening of entertainment. In the 17th century, the King even appointed a Master of the King's Games of Bears, Bulls, and Dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dogs' owners won prizes for their animals' spectacular performances, and the progeny of famous or particularly <em>game</em> dogs (meaning those dogs who refuse to quit the task at hand despite overwhelming adversity) were sought after and capable of bringing high prices. As distasteful as it sounds, these dogs produced the never-say-die stock from which today's Pit Bull claims her heritage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn end to legal blood sports in England finally came about in 1835, but that only pushed the fans and gamblers to conduct covert matches. Staging a clandestine bull-baiting would have been difficult, but scheduling a dogfight in a barn, cellar, or back room without being discovered was quite simple.\\r\\n\\r\\nDog fighting favored a slightly smaller, more agile gladiator than the dogs who were adept at baiting larger animals. Most historians believe that the stocky bull-baiting dogs were crossed with the swift and agile terriers of the time to produce the aptly named Bull and Terrier, a relatively small, smart, agile, tough, and strong game dog the likes of which had never been seen before. Other breed historians contend that no such cross was made and point out that the Bulldog of the time, the Bullenbeisser, was, in fact, so similar to the modern Pit Bull that it was simply a matter of selecting the most successful fighters. Whatever the recipe, it worked.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Bulldogs or Bull and Terriers became known less for their bull-baiting skills and more for their fighting skills in the pits, they came to be known as Pit Bulldogs, or more simply, Pit Bulls.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">The breed known today as the Bulldog or English Bulldog is not the same as the Bulldog of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The earlier Bulldog strain is the ancestor of both the modern Pit Bull breeds and the modern Bulldog, but it was more similar to today's Pit Bull than to today's Bulldog. Many people still incorrectly refer to Pit Bulls as \"Bulldogs,\" though.</p>\\r\\nWhen English immigrants came to America, they brought with them their sport and their dogs. By the mid-1800s, dog fighting had a solid following in America. With the migration west, Bulldogs once again found themselves called upon to do the toughest jobs. They served as all-purpose farm and guard dogs, protecting families and stock from fierce wildlife, rampaging cattle, and marauding vermin. Many also served as hunting dogs, holding their own against bears, wolves, and on occasion, buffalo. Once again, the Bulldog underwent a metamorphosis \u2014 this time into a larger dog that could best serve these vital functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis variety of purpose is directly responsible for the great range in size of today's Pit Bulls. An example of one possible size here.\\r\\n\\r\\n[caption id=\\\"attachment_275324\\\" /> Pit Bulls, because of their toughness, have been asked throughout history to do the tough jobs.[/caption]\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >Dog shows</h2>\\r\\nIn the late 1800s and early 1900s, <a href=\\\"https://www.dummies.com/pets/dogs/dog-adoption/should-you-choose-a-purebred-or-mixed-breed-puppy/\\\">purebred</a> dog mania was sweeping Europe and America. Anything that looked like a pure breed \u2014 and could be paraded around a show ring \u2014 was fair game. The fighting dogs (now dubbed Pit Bulls) seemed unlikely show dogs, however, for they lacked the desired association with the upper echelons of society (any association the upper class would admit to, that is).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) was formed in 1884 to promote the interests of purebred dogs. It did so by maintaining a pedigree registry and by sponsoring performance and conformation competitions. <em>Performance competitions</em> were designed to test dogs at the function for which they were bred; for example, pointing breeds competed at pointing field trials. <em>Conformation competitions</em> were designed to compare dogs to the breed's standard of excellence, which in turn was written to describe a dog who was built to perform the job for which he was bred.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the AKC was interested in promoting both the performance and the conformation of breeds was a problem because the job that the Pit Bull had been bred to perform was illegal. The AKC refused to endorse any aspect of dog fighting. And the old-time Pit Bull fighting men weren't too interested in exchanging the excitement of the dog pit for a trot around the show ring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, an alternative registration body, called the United Kennel Club (UKC), was formed in 1898 to register Pit Bulls (and later, other breeds). The UKC, founded by Pit Bull owner Chauncey Bennett, emphasized function and included dog fighting as a legitimate function of Pit Bulls. To this day, the UKC remains a strong registry for many breeds \u2014 especially its banner breed, the American Pit Bull Terrier \u2014 but it no longer endorses dog fighting in any manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UKC fancied up the breed's name by calling it the American (Pit) Bull Terrier, later changing the name to the now accepted American Pit Bull Terrier. Because the breed's roots are mostly European, and the Pit Bull may or may not have terrier influences, the name is somewhat of a misnomer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first American (Pit) Bull Terrier to be registered with the UKC was Bennett's Ring, owned by UKC founder Chauncey Bennett.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1909, Pit Bull proponents organized yet another registry, the American Dog Breeder's Association (ADBA). The ADBA registers only one breed: the American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT). The ADBA was traditionally the registry of fighting Pit Bulls. Although it no longer endorses dog fighting, it maintains that reputation. The ADBA instead now sponsors conformation shows and popular weight pulling contests.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 1970s, neither the UKC nor the ADBA sponsored conformation shows. Yet, some Pit Bull fans wanted to try their dogs in the show ring. In 1936, Pit Bull fans who wanted to try their dogs in the show ring sacrificed the breed's name (which was unacceptable to the AKC because of its fighting connotation) and replaced it with another name: the Staffordshire Terrier. The AKC welcomed Staffordshire Terriers into its registry and show rings. This turn of events set up an unusual situation in the world of dogs. The same dog can be registered as an American Pit Bull Terrier with the UKC and the ADBA, and as an American Staffordshire Terrier (the <em>American</em> was added in 1972 to distinguish the breed from the Staffordshire Bull Terrier) with the AKC. Over the years, Pit Bull fanciers have tended to stick with one registry (and breed name) over the other.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Today, the APBT and <em>AmStaff</em>) have diverged somewhat. AmStaffs tend to be larger and more muscular than APBTs. ABPTs have a greater range in looks because APBT breeders traditionally breed for function in the fighting pit rather than for looks in the show ring. Although there is considerable overlap, in general, AmStaffs the early 20th century, Pit Bulls moved graciously from fame as pit fighters to fame as national symbols. The Pit Bull's reputation for courage and tenacity, combined with his good nature, made him a natural as the dog synonymous with the United States during World War I. A popular war poster of the period aptly captures the true Pit Bull outlook by showing a picture of a Pit Bull wearing an American flag bandana above the phrase \"I'm neutral, but not afraid of any of them.\" Another poster featured a Pit Bull named Tige, who was the companion of the then-popular cartoon character Buster Brown. (Buster Brown and Tige also represented Buster Brown shoes in advertisements.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, a possible Pit Bull (or Pit Bull mix or Boston Terrier mix \u2014 nobody knows for sure) named Stubby emerged from World War I as a national hero. Stubby was the unofficial mascot of the 102nd infantry, and when it came time to go overseas, the men smuggled him on board. Despite no training or experience in battle conditions, Stubby braved intense shelling to comfort wounded soldiers lying in the crossfire. He eventually served for 18 months and participated in 17 battles. Stubby repeatedly warned his regiment of incoming mortar shells and mustard gas attacks, and once he even prevented a spy from escaping. When Stubby was wounded, he played the role of therapy dog, cheering hospitalized soldiers. Even while recuperating in Paris, he was credited with saving a child from being run over.\\r\\n\\r\\nStubby was decorated by General Pershing, awarded the rank of honorary sergeant, and received by three presidents. He led more parades than any dog in history. Upon Stubby's death in 1926, his hide was mounted over a plaster form of his body, with an urn containing his ashes inside. He was displayed wearing a medal-covered coat, first at the Red Cross Museum and then at the Smithsonian Institute. Until recently, Stubby was largely forgotten, packed away in a crate in a back room of the Smithsonian. But in 2018, an animated movie about him renewed interest and Stubby is back on exhibition at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next Pit Bull to capture America's heart was Petey of <em>The Little Rascals</em> and <em>Our Gang</em> movie fame. Actually, Petey had already starred in several Buster Brown movies (as Tige) before becoming one of the most popular Rascals of all time. When the original Petey died, he was replaced with another Petey, an American Staffordshire Terrier registered as Lucenay's Peter. Whatever his role, Pete the Pup exemplified the Pit Bull in his role as a roguish buddy, furthering the breed's appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nPopular with families and welcomed throughout neighborhoods, the Pit Bull basked in his reputation as a fun-loving and patient member of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not to say that things were always rosy, however. As far back as the late 1800s and early 1900s, breed bans were put in place against \"bulldogs,\" as they were called in several cities, including Washington, D.C. Although people tend to think of Pit Bull attacks as a more recent trend, around the turn of the twentieth century, they had already been in the news for killing people, with many reporters calling for their banishment.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab4\\\" >Overcoming pride and prejudice</h2>\\r\\nDog breeds often wax and wane in popularity, and so it has been with the Pit Bull. After World War II, the Pit Bull gradually faded from the public eye and the family home. True devotees, however, remained as loyal to their dogs as their dogs were to them. Some of the breed remained as steadfast pets, others continued as game pit dogs \u2014 and many performed both roles admirably.\\r\\n\\r\\nDog fighting, although illegal, continued to be carried out with minimal interference from law enforcement until the 1970s, when the American Dog Owner's Association (ADOA) formed to lobby against dogfights. The ADOA was successful in bringing public attention to the pit \u2014 helping to push dog fighting into the shadows and propelling pit dogs into an unflattering limelight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with many well-intentioned laws, some unforeseen problems accompanied the crackdown on dog fighting. Dog fighting continued; it just went underground. Its illegal nature attracted patrons whose major area of knowledge was in pay-offs and threats, not Pit Bulls. Knowledgeable <em>dogmen</em> (the term for serious breeders of fighting Pit Bulls) could no longer distribute information about training methods, leaving newcomers to dog fighting \u2014 who often believed scare tactic propaganda \u2014 to experiment using cruel practices. They trained the dogs using stolen puppies and dogs as \"bait dogs\" in an attempt to encourage them to kill, fed them gunpowder in an attempt to make them mean, and hired strangers to beat the dogs with clubs in an attempt to make them aggressive to strangers. Not surprisingly, their dogs seldom succeeded at matches, and they were often discarded. The harm done to these dogs made them difficult to place as pets, and the harm done to the breed's reputation was immeasurable.\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain segment of the population has always wanted to have the toughest dog on the block. Various breeds have filled these shoes throughout the years, and beginning in the early 1980s the Pit Bull was on its way to becoming the \"tough guy\" poster dog.\",\"description\":\"Perhaps no other dog breed has endured as many public misconceptions as has the Pit Bull.

The same dog can be registered as an American Pit Bull Terrier with the UKC and the ADBA, and as an American Staffordshire Terrier (the <em>American</em> was added in 1972 to distinguish the breed from the Staffordshire Bull Terrier) with the AKC. Over the years, Pit Bull fanciers have tended to stick with one registry (and breed name) over the other.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Today, the APBT and <em>AmStaff</em>) have diverged somewhat. AmStaffs tend to be larger and more muscular than APBTs. ABPTs have a greater range in looks because APBT breeders traditionally breed for function in the fighting pit rather than for looks in the show ring. Although there is considerable overlap, in general, AmStaffs the early 20th century, Pit Bulls moved graciously from fame as pit fighters to fame as national symbols. The Pit Bull's reputation for courage and tenacity, combined with his good nature, made him a natural as the dog synonymous with the United States during World War I. A popular war poster of the period aptly captures the true Pit Bull outlook by showing a picture of a Pit Bull wearing an American flag bandana above the phrase \"I'm neutral, but not afraid of any of them.\" Another poster featured a Pit Bull named Tige, who was the companion of the then-popular cartoon character Buster Brown. (Buster Brown and Tige also represented Buster Brown shoes in advertisements.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, a possible Pit Bull (or Pit Bull mix or Boston Terrier mix \u2014 nobody knows for sure) named Stubby emerged from World War I as a national hero. Stubby was the unofficial mascot of the 102nd infantry, and when it came time to go overseas, the men smuggled him on board. Despite no training or experience in battle conditions, Stubby braved intense shelling to comfort wounded soldiers lying in the crossfire. He eventually served for 18 months and participated in 17 battles. Stubby repeatedly warned his regiment of incoming mortar shells and mustard gas attacks, and once he even prevented a spy from escaping. When Stubby was wounded, he played the role of therapy dog, cheering hospitalized soldiers. Even while recuperating in Paris, he was credited with saving a child from being run over.\\r\\n\\r\\nStubby was decorated by General Pershing, awarded the rank of honorary sergeant, and received by three presidents. He led more parades than any dog in history. Upon Stubby's death in 1926, his hide was mounted over a plaster form of his body, with an urn containing his ashes inside. He was displayed wearing a medal-covered coat, first at the Red Cross Museum and then at the Smithsonian Institute. Until recently, Stubby was largely forgotten, packed away in a crate in a back room of the Smithsonian. But in 2018, an animated movie about him renewed interest and Stubby is back on exhibition at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next Pit Bull to capture America's heart was Petey of <em>The Little Rascals</em> and <em>Our Gang</em> movie fame. Actually, Petey had already starred in several Buster Brown movies (as Tige) before becoming one of the most popular Rascals of all time. When the original Petey died, he was replaced with another Petey, an American Staffordshire Terrier registered as Lucenay's Peter. Whatever his role, Pete the Pup exemplified the Pit Bull in his role as a roguish buddy, furthering the breed's appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nPopular with families and welcomed throughout neighborhoods, the Pit Bull basked in his reputation as a fun-loving and patient member of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not to say that things were always rosy, however. As far back as the late 1800s and early 1900s, breed bans were put in place against \"bulldogs,\" as they were called in several cities, including Washington, D.C. Although people tend to think of Pit Bull attacks as a more recent trend, around the turn of the twentieth century, they had already been in the news for killing people, with many reporters calling for their banishment.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab4\\\" >Overcoming pride and prejudice</h2>\\r\\nDog breeds often wax and wane in popularity, and so it has been with the Pit Bull. After World War II, the Pit Bull gradually faded from the public eye and the family home. True devotees, however, remained as loyal to their dogs as their dogs were to them. Some of the breed remained as steadfast pets, others continued as game pit dogs \u2014 and many performed both roles admirably.\\r\\n\\r\\nDog fighting, although illegal, continued to be carried out with minimal interference from law enforcement until the 1970s, when the American Dog Owner's Association (ADOA) formed to lobby against dogfights. The ADOA was successful in bringing public attention to the pit \u2014 helping to push dog fighting into the shadows and propelling pit dogs into an unflattering limelight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with many well-intentioned laws, some unforeseen problems accompanied the crackdown on dog fighting. Dog fighting continued; it just went underground. Its illegal nature attracted patrons whose major area of knowledge was in pay-offs and threats, not Pit Bulls. Knowledgeable <em>dogmen</em> (the term for serious breeders of fighting Pit Bulls) could no longer distribute information about training methods, leaving newcomers to dog fighting \u2014 who often believed scare tactic propaganda \u2014 to experiment using cruel practices. They trained the dogs using stolen puppies and dogs as \"bait dogs\" in an attempt to encourage them to kill, fed them gunpowder in an attempt to make them mean, and hired strangers to beat the dogs with clubs in an attempt to make them aggressive to strangers. Not surprisingly, their dogs seldom succeeded at matches, and they were often discarded. The harm done to these dogs made them difficult to place as pets, and the harm done to the breed's reputation was immeasurable.\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain segment of the population has always wanted to have the toughest dog on the block. Various breeds have filled these shoes throughout the years, and beginning in the early 1980s the Pit Bull was on its way to becoming the \"tough guy\" poster dog.\",\"blurb\":\"\",\"authors\":[{\"authorId\":9962,\"name\":\"D.
