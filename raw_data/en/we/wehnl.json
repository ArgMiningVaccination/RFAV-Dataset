These conduits often were poorly constructed and are not frequently ins pected, if at all. Deteriorating conduits pose an increas ingly greater ris k for developing defects that can lead to embankment dam failure with each passing year. In an ef fort to deal with this problem, this document has been pr epared to collect and dis seminate inf ormation and exper ience that is current and has a technical consensus. This document pr ovides procedur es and guidance f or \"bes t practices \" concer ning design, construction, problem identification and evaluation, inspection, maintenance, renovation, and repair associated with conduits through embankment dams. Most of the available inf ormation on thes e topics was reviewed in pr eparing this document. Where detailed documentation existed, it was cited to avoid duplicating available materials. The authors have strived not to reproduce information that is readily accessible in the public domain. This document attempts to condense and summarize the vast body of existing information, provide a clear and concise synopsis of this information, and present a recommended course of action. This document is intended for us e by pers onnel familiar with embankment dams and conduits, such as designers, inspectors, construction oversight personnel, and dam safety engineer s. In preparation of this document, the authors frequently found conflicting procedures and s tandar ds in the many r eferences they r eviewed. Wher e conf licts were appar ent, the author s focused on what they judged to be the \"bes t practice\" and included that judgment in this document. Therefore, this document may be different than some of the various participating agencies' own policies. Embankment dams, regardless of their size, create a hazard potential from the stored energy of the water they impound. Examples , such as Kelley B arnes Dam, which failed s uddenly in 1977, s how the des tructive power of water when it is released suddenly from behind even a small embankment dam. This embankment dam was less than about 40 feet high and about 400 feet long, but when it failed, it released water downstream at an estimated flow rate of over 24,000 ft3/s, killing 39 people. The hazard potential of an embankment dam is based on the consequences of failure, rather than its structural integrity. Embankment dams can be classified according to their hazard potential for causing damages downs tream should they f ail. Various State and f ederal agencies have different systems for rating the hazard classes of embankment dams. A single, univer sally accepted hazar d classification s ystem does not exis t. All of the hazar d classification systems group embankment dams into categories based on the potential iii Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams impacts of a theor etical r elease of the s tored water during a dam f ailure. However , the mos t common pr oblem with all of these clas sification s ystems is the lack of clear , concise, and consistent terminology. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a hazard classification sy stem that is clear and suc cinct, and this system was adopted f or the pur poses of this document. The reader is directed to F EMA 333, Federal Guid elines for Da m Safety: Hazard Potentia l Classifica tion System s for Da ms (1998), f or a complete ver sion of their system. The FEMA document us es three hazar d potential levels to clas sify embankment dams . These levels are summar ized as follows : Low hazar d potential .\u2014Embankment dams assigned the low hazar d classification are those where failure or misoperation results in no probable loss of human life and low economic and/or environmental losses. Losses are principally limited to the owner's property. Significant hazard potential .\u2014Embankment dams assigned the significant hazard classification are dams where failure or misoperation results in no probable loss of human life, but can cause economic loss, environmental damage, or disruption of lifeline facilities , or can impact other concerns . Significant hazard potential classification dams are often located in predominantly rural or agricultural areas, but could be located in areas with population and significant infrastructure. High hazard potential .\u2014Embankment dams assigned the high hazard classification are thos e where failure or mis operation will probably caus e loss of human life. Hazard potential Economic, environmental, lifeline classification Loss of human life losses Low None expected Low and gener ally limited to owner Signif icant None expected Yes High Probable\u2014one or Yes (but not ne cessary for thi s more expected classification) Embankment dam hazard classifications are assigned based on their potential for causing downs tream damage, but thes e clas sifications do not r eflect in any way on the likelihood that the dam may fail. An embankment dam might be classified as having a low hazard potential based on the impacts a failure would have on the downs tream area, but have a high probability of failure if it were in very poor iv Preface condition. The hazard classification says nothing about the safety or condition of the structure. The guidance in this document is cons idered valid technically without r egard to the hazard potential classification of a particular embankment dam. However, some design measures that are commonly used for design of high and significant hazard embankment dams may be considered overly robust for use in low hazard dams. As an example, chimney f ilters that extend acr oss the entir e width of the embankment fill section are recommended for mos t high hazard embankment dams . Many smaller, low hazard embankment dams are constructed without this feature. This document recommends that even low hazard embankment dams should contain other currently accepted des ign meas ures that addr ess seepage and inter nal erosion along the conduit. Specifically, a filter diaphragm or filter collar around the conduit is recommended for all embankment dams penetrated by a conduit. Often, low hazard embankment dams are small structures (height or reservoir volume). The term \"small embankment dam\" does not have a s ingle widely accepted definition. Some designers may consider a 25-foot high embankment dam to be the largest dam in the small dams category, and others may consider this to be the smallest dam in the large dam category. The International Commis sion on Large Dams defines large embankment dams as being more than about 50 feet high. For this reason, this document will cons ider only the hazard potential of the embankment dam. The focus of this document is on significant and high hazard embankment dams due to the concern for loss of life and property damage. However , wher e appr opriate, deviation f rom the guidance is noted f or low hazar d embankment dams. This deviation is not all inclusive, and the designer may find additional guidance on the design and construction of conduits within low hazard embankment dams in Natural R esources Conservation Service (NR CS) National Handbook of Conservation Practice Standard Code 378 Pond (2002). The designer should be aware that future downstream development could require revising the hazard potential classification from low to significant or high. Pressurized conduits are not recommended at low hazar d embankment dams , since thes e structures often lack regular inspections and may not contain the appropriate safety features as discussed in this document.

Conduits through embankment dams serve a variety of purposes. Conduits typically convey releases for: Releasing stored water s to meet downs tream requirements Providing emer gency r eservoir evacuation Flood control regulation to release waters temporarily stored in flood control space Diverting flow into canals or pipelines Providing flows for power generation Satisfying a combination of multipurpos e requirements Stream diversion during construction Most conduits through embankment dams are part of outlet works systems. However, s ome conduits act as either primary or s ervice s pillways ; auxiliary or secondary s pillways to as sist the primary s pillway s tructure in pas sing floods ; or power conduits (penstocks) used for the generation of power. Conduits can be classified as either : Nonp ressurized flow.\u2014Open channel flow at atmospheric pressure for part or all of the conduit length (figure 1). This type of flow is also referred to as \"free flow.\" Pressure flow .\u2014Pressurized flow throughout the conduit length to the point of regulation or control or terminal structure (figure 2) Many types of mater ials have been us ed for conduits over the year s, such as reinforced cas t-in-place and pr ecast concr ete, ther moset plas tic, cast and ductile iron, welded steel, corrugated metal, and aluminum. Some early builder s of conduits used whatever mater ials were readily available, s uch as wood (figure 3) and hand- placed r ubble mas onry (figure 4). Regar dless of the mater ial use, a conduit represents a discontinuity through an embankment dam and its foundation. Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Figure 1.\u2014Nonpressu rized outlet works. Figure 2.\u2014Pressuri zed outlet wo rks. This discontinuity ca n cause settlement to be different a djacent to the conduit tha n it is in the res t of the embankment dam. Earthfill may als o be compacted differently around a conduit than for the rest of the embankment dam. These factors can cause cracking of the earthfill and lead to other cons equences . Failures of embankment dams caused by the uncontrolled flow of water through the dam or foundation are a common problem. A conduit can develop defects from deterioration, cracking from foundation compres sibility, or joint s eparation due to poor des ign and cons truction. Water leaking from defects in conduits can contribute to seepage pressures exceeding thos e that occur solely from flow thr ough s oils in the embankment dam from the res ervoir. When preferential flow paths develop in the earthfill through which water can flow and erode the fill, s evere problems or breaching type failures often result. The reasons that conduits contribute to these failures are discussed more extens ively in s everal sections of this document. Historically, a s ingle term, \"piping,\" has been commonly us ed in literature to describe all erosional processes involved in embankment dam failures. The reason for this is that frequently after a failure, a tunnel-s haped feature res embling a pipe is observed. See figure 5 for an example. In this document, two terms will be us ed to describe failures of embankment dams associated with uncontrolled flow of water, rather than us ing a s ingle generic term. The two terms that will be us ed in this document ar e: Backward erosion piping and Internal erosion 2 Introd uction Figure 3.\u2014A 15-inch diameter, wi re-wra pped wood sta ve pipe used a s an outlet wor ks condui t within a 75-yea r old em bankment da m.

Flow was not di rectly a long the conta ct betw een earthfill and condui t, but i n the ea rthfill away from condui t. Hydraulic fracture in highly dispersive clay embankment soi ls caused the fa ilure. The embankment desi gn included a ntiseep colla rs, but not a filter diaphragm. These two ter ms are mor e descriptive of the dis tinctly dif ferent mechanis ms by which water can damage embankment dams. In this document, the term \"backward erosion piping\" will be res erved to des cribe conditions where water flows not through preferential flow paths, such as cracks in the soil, but through the pores of a soil. The flow causing the mechanism of failure termed \"backward erosion piping\" is solely that f rom inter granular flow caus ing exces sive seepage f orces at an exit f ace. These seepage f orces caus e a boil condition or particle detachment at an exit f ace, if it is not protected by a properly designed filter. The term \"backward erosion piping\" is used in an attempt to define this precise condition of failure. The term \"internal erosion,\" discussed in the following paragraph, describes the more common way that water can damage embankment dams, as it flows through cracks, discontinuities at the inter faces between conduits and ear then embankments or their foundations , or other preferential flow paths. Seepage flow for internal erosion is typically concentr ated. The term \"internal eros ion\" will be us ed in this document to des cribe all conditions other than \"backward erosion piping\" by which water flowing through embankment dams or foundations erodes the s oils and caus es a failure. Internal erosion occur s where water flows through a discontinuity in the embankment dam and/or foundation, and er odes the s ides of the cr ack to enlar ge it and caus e a failure. The term \"internal erosion\" is used in lieu of a number of terms that have historically been used to describe variations of this generic process including scour, concentrated leak piping, and others . This term will als o be us ed for another type of condition called suffosion. Suffosion is the type of erosion where the matrix of the soil mass is 4 Introd uction unstable. When s eepage occur s, the f iner part of the s oil matr ix is eroded out, leaving behind a much coarser fraction. \"Backward erosion piping\" can develop only in a category of soils susceptible to this mechanism of failures. Certain conditions are required for backward erosion piping to occur, as described by Von Thun (ASDSO, 1996, p. 5), with added conditions suggested by McCook (ASDSO, 2004, p. 8), summarized as follows: A flow path/source of water. An unprotected exit (open, unfiltered) from which material can escape. Erodible mater ial within the f low path that can be car ried to the exit. The material being piped or the material directly above it must be able to form and support a \"roof\" or \"pipe.\" Water initially flows exclus ively within the pore s pace of s oils. This is often termed inter granular seepage. If flow is through macr o-features or cracks in the soil or along an inter face between the s oil and another structure, the ter m internal erosion is more correct for describing problems that occur. The soil through which water is seeping is susceptible to backwar d erosion piping. The most susc eptible soil types are fine sands a nd silts with little clay and no plas ticity. Clays and clayey coar se-grained s oils are highly r esistant to backwar d erosion piping. The resistance of clays and clayey coar se-grained s oils results from the high inter particle attr action caus ed by electr ochemical f orces. Internal mechanis are for mos t failur es wher e clayey s oils are in the f low path. Internal erosion may develop any time a discontinuity occurs within an embankment dam tha t is accessible to wa ter in the reservoir or to wa ter flowing in conduits. Cracks caus ed by hydraulic fracture of the earthfill, cracks in bedrock that the embankment is in contact with, and other preferential flow paths provide a way that water can er ode s oils in contact with the f eature. Internal erosion is extremely dangerous because of the rapidity in which flow paths can erode, particularly for highly erosive soils, such as low plasticity silts or di spersive clays. Figures 5 and 6 show examples of failure due to inter nal erosion as sociated with a conduit thr ough the embankment dam. The terms backward erosion piping and internal erosion are defined in the glossary in this document. To further assist readers in understanding the definition of these two terms in the context of this document, the following illustrations are provided: 5 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Figure 6.\u2014Em bankment da m failure caused by i nternal erosion of ea rthfill near the condui t.

Hydraulic fracture in highly dispersive clay embankment soi ls caused the fa ilure. The embankment da m design included a ntiseep colla rs, but no fi lter di aphragm. Figure 7 illus trates the internal eros ion proces s as a res ult of a hydraulic fracture through the embankment dam. Figure 8 illus trates the internal eros ion proces s as a res ult of low dens ity embankment materials under the haunches of a pipe due to poor compaction. Figure 9 illus trates the internal eros ion proces s associated with the creation of a void caus ed by exces sive compactive ener gy us ed to compact embankment materials against the conduit. Figure 10 shows the backward erosion piping process associated with intergranular seepage and the subsequent backward erosion of soil particles. All four of thes e mechanis ms can lead to partial or full failures of the embankment dam. Internal erosion and backward erosion piping can occur suddenly and with little warning. In these cases, little may be done to addr ess the pr oblem quickly enough to avert a failure. Recognizing conditions likely to res ult in thes e failure mechanis ms is essential to design of conduits and embankment dams that are resistant to failures. In other cases, the f ailure mechanis ms may develop s lowly and go unr ecognized until the subterranean erosion develops cavities in the embankment dam large enough to 6 Introd uction An embankment dam wit h a low reserv oir wat er level. The reserv oir wat er level rises, inducing a hydraulic f racture wit hin the embankment da m due to poor constructi on or defecti ve soils. The hydra ulic fracture ex tends through the emba nkment da m as a result of arching of the overlying embankment, resulting in low stress con centrations in the soil and a reservoir level high eno ugh to cause the fr acture. Conduits often create differenti al settlement a nd arching of the ea rthfill, beca use settlement of the emba nkment da m is less above the condui t than on ei ther s ide of i t.

The internal erosion process con tinues as w ater flowing in the hydraulic fracture widens the wa lls of the fr acture. Intergranular seepage is not involved in the proces s, and the s oils surroundi ng the fra cture a re uns aturated. Intergranular seepage rarely has time to devel op, since this type o f failure occurs most frequent ly on f irst filling of the reserv oir. Figure 7 (con t'd).\u2014The internal erosion process as a result of a hydraulic fracture. 8 A vortex may f orm at the locat ion where wat er in the reserv oir ent ers the upstream end of the hydraulic fracture. Often, the end r esult of internal erosion along the hydr aulic fracture is a tunnel- shaped voi d (see figure 5) . Loss of the res ervoir contents can occur by water flowi ng through the tunnel- shaped voi d. Where the tunnel- shaped voi d enlarges sufficiently ( see figure 5) , the roof of the tunnel colla pses, leaving a v-shaped notch i n the emba nkment da m like tha t shown i n figure 6. If the reservoir had conta ined a little more s torage and the flow ha d conti nued a little longer through the tunnel- shaped voi d, the emba nkment da m shown i n figure 5 would ha ve co llapsed and looked similar to the em bankment da m in figure 6. Figure 7 (con t'd).\u2014The internal erosion process as a result of a hydraulic fracture. 9 Poor compaction causes arching to occur in the area of the conduit's haunches. This creates a low density zone subject to hydraulic fracture. Water flowing through the hydraulic fracture can erode the sides, leading to internal erosion and the development of a void along the conduit. Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams The hydraulic fracture can propagate in a downstream direction and initiate flowing water from the reservoir.

The fo undation is assumed to be a soil susceptible to piping such as fine, poorly graded sand. A filter zone is not provided at the seepage discharge fa ce (or the fi lter ha s been i mproperly des igned), a llowing backwa rd ero sion piping to begin. Intergra nular seepage flow condi tions exist within the founda tion under the embankment da m, and soil particles are rem oved. The pa rticles are depo sited (sand boils) on the ground surface at the downstream toe, or w ashed away if flow is higher.

Visual inspection, seepage and tur bidity meas urements , and por e pressure readings are useful in detecting whether problems like these may be developing in an embankment dam. Chapter 9 discusses inspection te chniques in detail. Design and construction inadequacies are often to blame for internal erosion and backward erosion piping incidents. Designers must understand which design meas ures are effective in pr eventing thes e mechanis ms of failure. In nonpressurized conduits, water seeping through the embankment dam can enter the conduit thr ough def ects. If the s urrounding s oils are susceptible to backwar d erosion piping, cavities can develop in the embankment and foundation of the conduit. This problem is discussed in more detail in s ection 7.1. In pressure flow conduits, water under pressure can escape through defects and damage the surrounding embankment and foundation. This problem is discussed in more detail in s ection 7.2. In nonpr essurized or pressurized conduits , water seeping along the inter face between the conduit and s urrounding s oil may be concentr ated enough to r esult in backwar d erosion piping, if the s oils are susceptible. If the s oils are resistant to backwar d erosion piping, but a crack or potential flow path develops near the conduit, internal erosion can res ult. This problem is discussed in more detail in s ection 7.3. If the soils surrounding the conduit are resistant to backward erosion piping, hydraulic f ractur e may occur . The hydr aulic f ractur e created can then er ode and lead to a failure tunnel that is similar to that which develops in soils that are s usceptible to backward erosion piping. This problem is discussed in more detail in section 7.4. Internal erosion and backward erosion piping incidents are often associated with conduits through embankment dams. The following factors increase the likelihood of these problems developing at a given site: Conduits constructed across abruptly changing foundation conditions (i.e., a concr ete cor e wall or bedr ock with a quickly changing pr ofile) ar e mor e likely to exper ience dif ferential s ettlement. See s ection 1.2 f or more discussion on factors in locating conduits in the most favorable conditions. Circular conduits constructed without concrete bedding or cradles are more likely to exper ience pr oblems than conduits in mor e favorable shapes (i.e., horseshoe). See section 4.1 for more discussion on conduit shapes. Conduits with an excessive number of joints are more likely to develop defects that can lead to problems. See section 4.3 for discussion on joints in conduits. 17 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Excavations made to replace unsuitable foundation materials for conduits increase the potential f or differential s ettlement pr oblems . Section 5.1 als o discusses this factor. Conduits with compr essible foundations are mor e likely to def orm exces sively, which may damage the conduit. Compressible foundations may also contribute to differential s ettlement that can res ult in hydraulic fracture of the earthfill surrounding the conduit. Section 5.1.2 discusses soil foundations for conduits. Locating conduits on bedrock is desirable, but not always practical. See section 1.2 for more discussion on factors in locating conduits in the most favorable conditions. Conduits located in closure sections in embankment dams contribute to differential s ettlement problems . Section 5.2 dis cusses this factor in detail. Embankment da ms constructed with ma terials susceptible to interna l erosion or backward erosion piping. Sections 5.2 and 5.3 discuss this factor in detail. Conduits constructed without adequate compaction around the conduit are more likely to exper ience er osional pr oblems . Section 5.3 dis cusses this factor in detail. Embankment dams cons tructed without a chimney f ilter or conduits constructed without a f ilter collar or filter diaphr agm. See chapter 6 for more discussion on the design and construction of filters. Conduits constructed of materials susceptible to deterioration, such as corrugated metal pipe. See chapter 8 for discussion of defects in conduits. Unders tanding the s teps involved in a failure mode as the res ult of internal eros ion or backward piping erosion is important in designing defensive measures to prevent these failures. An event tr ee can be us ed to under stand the s eries of events that can lead to embankment dam failure by internal erosion or backward erosion piping. An event tr ee us ed by the B ureau of Reclamation (Reclamation, 2000, p. 15) f or inter nal erosion of an existing embankment dam is shown in figure 11. The steps or \"nodes\" of the event tree shown on figure 11 are generally described as follows: 1. The reservoir rises, causing a water load on the embankment dam. The information is generally derived from the statistical historic record of reservoir operations . Normally, it is the probability of a res ervoir to ris e onto a portion of the embankment dam that might contain a flaw and not usually the time that the reservoir exists at a s pecific elevation. 18Introd uction Figure 11 .\u2014Example of a n event tree used to i llustra te the i nterna l erosi on process. 19 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams 2. The next node of the event tr ee cons iders the potential f or a concentr ated leak to exis t or newly occur . The leak mus t be of sufficient s ize to r easonably expect the soil erosion process to begin. 3. The next node then considers if the erosion process continues. This is usually done by as sessing the potential f or an adequate f ilter to exis t at the downs tream end of the leak. 4. If there is no reasonable expectation of a filter, the potential f or the er osion process to progress is examined in the next three nodes by considering (a) the potential for a roof to form over the pipe channel, (b) the potential for an element at the ups tream end of the leak to limit f low, and (c) the er osion characteristics of the embankment material. 5. If the eros ion proces s will fully reach the progres sion stage, the potential to successfully intervene to prevent failure soon after detection of the erosion is considered. 6. If such ear ly inter vention will not likely be s uccessful, the potential f or the embankment dam to fully breach is considered. 7. If the embankment dam is of a type that can actually breach, the potential to heroically inter vene to s ave the dam is examined (e.g., the potential to quickly lower the r eservoir). The culmination of a negative outcome of all the events in the event tree is the catastrophic release of the reservoir. This event tr ee is usually us ed by Reclamation to as sess the potential f or the f ailure of an existing embankment dam in a risk context. In a risk assessment of an internal erosion failure mode, a probability of the event tree would be es timated and this would be multiplied by some consequence of the embankment dam failure, usually life loss. The event tr ee was developed f or the inter nal erosion failure mode only. An event tree for a failure mode of backward erosion piping might be slightly different than this one. For instance, ins tead of the potential f or a concentr ated leak, the initiation node might evaluate the potential for a high exit gradient to begin the erosion process. For a new embankment dam being des igned, under standing the events that can lead to failure by internal erosion or backward erosion piping can lead to improvements in the design. As most of the steps of the process are considered, opportunities for multiple lines of defense in the design can be developed. Compilations of case histories of embankment dam failures and accidents show that frequently, conduits were cons idered a f actor in the f ailures or accidents . Cas e histories such as those shown in appendix B are examples of embankment dams 20Introd uction wher e conduits were associated with f ailures and accidents . The case histories in appendix B include a variety of situations where defects in the conduit and poor design or construction decisions contributed to the failures. Several modes of failure are discussed in this document r elated to conduits , which include both the backwar d erosion piping and internal erosion modes of failure. Appendix B includes very few case histories that involve backward erosion piping associated with conduits. This is because soils that are highly susceptible to backward erosion piping have seldom been us ed to backfill around conduits . Most case histories of failures and accidents involving conduits are related to one of the internal erosion modes of failure. Both this Introduction and chapter 7 provide more discussion on modes of failure. In 1998, a s urvey of State dam s afety programs was conducted for the I nteragency Committee on Dam Safety (ICODS) Seminar No. 6 on piping associated with conduits through embankment dams (Evans, 1999, p. 1). Fourteen states provided respons es to the s urvey. The respondents indicated that 1,115 embankment dams with conduits would likely need r epair within the next 10 year s. Of these 1,115 embankment dams, 53 percent had conduits constructed with corrugated metal pipe (CMP), 23 per cent wer e cons tructed with s teel pipe, and 20 per cent wer e cons tructed with concrete pipe. Conduits within embankment dams are often designed using standards not specifically intended for penetrations through dams. For example, certain pressure pipe standards (e.g., those from the American Water Works Association) may not be applicable (without design and construction modifications) for use in pressurized conduits through embankment dams. The purpose and performance characteristics of conduits through embankment dams differ from those required for water supply pipelines. The use of certain types of manufactured pipe for conduits through embankment dams is a concer n, since thes e mater ials were developed and standardized for applications other than embankment dams. The unique performance requirements for conduits in embankment dams include: Service life .\u2014Most embankment dams are designed assuming a minimum 100-year service lif e with minimal maintenance. Manufactured pipe needs to be durable in the expected wet, dr y, and f reeze/thaw envir onments found within a conduit. Accessib ility.\u2014As the height of the embankment dam increases, the practicality of acces sing the conduit f or repairs decr eases. Manufacturing and ins tallation quality control needs to be high to ensure dependable installations. Strength .\u2014The structural loading on manufactured pipes can be very high due to positive projecting, rather than trench loading conditions, and very high embankments. The pipe needs to be structurally designed for all possible loading conditions for applications within embankment dams. 21 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Risk.\u2014The development of small def ects within the conduit can lead to s erious failure modes threatening the entir e embankment dam. Designs needs to be robust and conservative. Movem ent.\u2014Conduits within high embankments dams, built on compressible foundations , may exper ience s ignificant dis placement as the dam s ettles. The conduit joints need to be capable of absorbing such movements while remaining water tight. The conduit placement needs to anticipate s ubsequent settlement in order to remain positively sloping for gravity drainage. Inexper ienced des igners may inadver tently apply inappr opriate des ign standar ds or misuse design standards to sa ve on ti me and prov ide cost savings. Examples of the misapplication of de sign standards include: Inappropriate design references.\u2014State highway department standard plans for culver ts and culver t structures are sometimes simply r eferred to in cons truction specifications and drawings to save the designer from actually designing the conduit. Culvert designs are not intended for use within embankment dams. Inappropriate applicatio n of standar ds.\u2014The NRCS has developed several standardized conduit and joint detail drawings for use in embankment dams. Such drawings have been used to successfully build thousands of small embankment dams. Such drawings have also been misused. In one known case, the s tandar d detail dr awings were used to uns uccessfully ins tall a pressurized conduit on a high hazard embankment dam on a soft foundation. As with all standardized designs and drawings, the design and construction assumptions made in preparing the drawings need to be satisfied for the specific application and site. Inappropriate use of materials.\u2014Reinforced concrete pressure pipe has been used for pressurized conduits within embankment dams. Reinforced concrete pressure pipe utilizes gasketed joints , which could be s ubject to leakage, if improperly constructed. In a typical 100-foot high embankment dam there could be over 80 gas keted joints , all with the potential f or leakage. Conduits often penetrate other types of embankment structures or are used for utility purpos es. These types of penetrations are not addres sed in detail in this document. Some of the guidance pr esented in this document may apply to thes e types of penetrations and should be carefully evaluated by designers for implementation. Users of this document will need to evaluate the applicability of the proper guidance to their project. Conduit penetrations not specifically addressed within this document include: 22Introd uction Conduits within levees .\u2014Guidance on conduits through levees is available from other sources, such as the USACE's Design and Construction of Levees (2000). Utility conduits .\u2014Utility conduits are utilized for various functions , such as water, wastewater , sewer, electr ical, telecommunications , and gas lines . As urbanization pushes farther out into previously undeveloped or agricultural areas , more utility conduit cros sings of embankment dams are being required. While many of the new utility conduits installations are made through low hazard dams, the continued urbanization may make previously low hazard structures become significant or high hazard dams. Typically, reques ts for utility cros sings are made to local and State agencies . These agencies provide the neces sary review and r ight-of-way per mitting. If at all possible, these conduit crossings should be located outside the limits of the embankment dam, so as not to provide a discontinuity within the dam or a transverse seepage path thr ough the dam. Inexperienced des igners associated with utility conduits may utilize des igns that trench through the embankment dam for new installations or to repair or replace exis ting conduits and not us e proper excavation, backfill, and compaction practices around the conduit. This can lead to failure of the embankment dam. Any utility conduit ins tallation s hould be des igned by a professional engineer experienced in the design and construction of embankment dams. If these conduits must be located within the embankment dam, they should be positioned in the upper crest of the dam, well above the design flood elevation. Typically, this is not a problem, as the utility owner requires permanent acces s to the conduit. If the utility conduit is for a water line, special precautions should be employed, so that a rupture of the conduit will not continue unchecked and caus e eros ion of the embankment dam. Such precautions should consider applicable guidance contained within this document, automatic s hutoff mechanis ms, frequent tes ting and ins pection of the system, and visual moni toring. Another concern with utility conduit cros sings are unauthorized ins tallations . Embankment dam failures have occurred as the res ult of unauthorized utility conduit installations where no notice was given to the responsible agency for proper review and right-of-way permitting. All embankment dams should be marked with \"no tr espassing\" s igns. Unf ortunately, thes e signs are often ignored during unauthorized utility conduit ins tallations . One alternative to burying the utility conduit cros sing within an embankment dam is to cons truct the cr ossing over the cr est of the dam. This alter native has been s uccessfully us ed by USACE f or conduit cr ossings over levees and is best suited for small diameter pipes. To accomplish this alternative, additional 23Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams earthfill is added on the cres t of the dam, s o a ramp is cons tructed over the utility conduit to allow for the cros sing of vehicular traffic. Typically, a minimum of 2 feet of cover is provided over the conduit and a 6-percent grade is utilized on the ramps . Additional earthfill is ramped around the utility conduit on both the upstream and downstream faces of the embankment dam as needed to pr ovide pr otective cover . The grade on thes e ramps is usually about 10 per cent. This alter native eliminates any concer ns associated with excavation into the embankment dam. Conduits within tailings and slurry impoundment dams .\u2014This document is intended to apply to traditional embankment type dams. The design and construction of conduits through tailings and s lurry impoundments often utilize different guidelines than thos e presented in this document. Tailings and s lurry dams are an integral and vital component of mining operations . Tailings dams permanently retain mining, chemical, and indus trial waste products (e.g., ground-up rock that remains after the mineral value has been removed from the ore). Figure 12 s hows an example of a tailings dam. A slurry dam per manently r etains waste created by the pr ocessing and was hing of coal. These structures retain the was te products and allow them to s ettle out, enabling r eclamation (r ecycling) of the s lurry water , and per manent r etention and eventual restoration of the site. The coar ser fraction of the was te mater ial is commonly us ed to cons truct the dam, with the finer waste being pumped as slurry behind the dam. Typically, tailings and s lurry dams are cons tructed over the life of the mine, with the dam being raised as needed to provide additional disposal capacity. The dams may be raised by downstream, upstream, or centerline construction. In many cases, the dams reach several hundred feet in height. As with any dam, an important aspect of these impoundments is handling water , in this case both s torm runoff and water pumped in with the s lurry. Some of the dams are totally diked structures while others have contributing watersheds. Often the impoundment water is reclaimed for use in processing or in other mining activities. The seepage from these impoundments can cause chemical deterioration due to its acidity or alkalinity. In some cas es, the nature of the leachate requires that the impoundment be provided with an impervious liner. A \"decanting s ystem\" typically r emoves free water from behind the dam. Designers use a var iety of methods and mater ials to decant water from s lurry and tailings dams . Decanting s ystems often cons ist of an extendable intake structure (e.g., tower or sloping chute) and a conduit to convey dis charge away from the tailings dam. Figure 13 s hows an example of an intake s tructure for a decanting s ystem. The intake s tructure is normally cons tructed pr ogressively as the deposition level rises to avoid the costs of a high, unsupported structure 24 Introd uction Figure 12 .\u2014An example of a tailings dam. before the impoundment is constructed. Reinforced cast-in-place concrete, precast concr ete, steel, and plas tic conduits have all been us ed. Some des igners prefer to avoid having a conduit pass through the dam and use either floating pump installations or siphons to decant the water. Use of these options is especially f avored in ar eas wher e the impoundment can be located high in the watershed to minimize runoff inflow, and in areas, such as portions of the western United States , wher e rainfall is low. Designers also cite the advantage in this approach of eliminating potential problems with decant conduit risers, such as structural s tability and debris clogging. Some tailings dams are required to be provided with impervious liners due to the acidity of the leachate. In these cases, if a decant conduit is used, a water tight connection mus t be achieved between the liner and the conduit. The presence of the liner affects these installations by limiting the potential f or seepage along the conduit. Some tailings dam failures and problems have been attributed to problems with compaction of the backfill around the decant conduit. A notable occurrence was a failure at a phos phate tailings dam in Florida in 1994. While this case involved CMP, it highlighted the difficulty in obtaining adequate compaction in the haunch area under the pipe. Postfailure investigation of two other decants that had been ins talled at the s ame facility indicated gaps or loos e areas in the haunch area backfill. Interes tingly, although plas tic and s teel pipes have been used extensively in slurry impoundments, no failures are known to have occur red, and only a f ew pr oblems have been attr ibuted to inadequate haunch area compaction in thes e applications . In the pas t, decant pipes were cons tructed of CMP. However , in many cas es the acidity of the r efuse caus ed cor rosion pr oblems . Protective coatings were 25 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Figure 13 .\u2014An example of a deca nt intake structure. employed to combat this problem, but ther e also were problems with the watertightness of the joints. This problem became particularly apparent when dam safety regulators began to require pressure testing of the pipes. As a result of problems with corrosion and joint watertightness, and to deal with increas ing fill heights over the pipes , designers turned to two other types of decant pipes: thick-walled welded steel pipe, and high density polyethylene pipe (HDPE). Pipes were often des igned to withs tand the fill height loading from several stages of construction, and the pipe would be replaced by installing another pipe at a higher elevation, with the original pipe being filled with grout. Designers cons idered cor rosion-protected welded s teel and HDP E pipes to be beneficial for the type of foundation conditions and construction practices found at thes e dams . The locations of these dams are limited to ar eas near the processing plants, meaning that designers need to deal with varied, and often less than ideal, foundation conditions. Furthermore, as these pipes may be extended up- or downs tream, their length can become r elatively long, sometimes exceeding 1,000 f eet. Over such lengths , a flexible pipe could tolerate some differential movement due to varying foundation conditions. Additionally, many of these dams have underground mining in their vicinity and the pos sibility of mining-induced ground movement needs to be cons idered. The pipes used for the decanting s ystems have typically been ins talled without being encas ed in concr ete. In mos t cases, the pipes have been ins talled with hand compaction of the backfill in the haunch area. Hand held compaction equipment has often been us ed. Flowable fill has been us ed in a few cas es. A 26 Introd uction more recent pr acticed has been to place the pipe high in the dam cr oss section, so that it is above the normal phreatic level; then the pipe is grouted and replaced by another pipe when the next stage is constructed. A concern for a pipe placed high in the dam is that a large storm could result in a raised phreatic level which may s ubject the pipe to a s ituation analogous to \"firs t filling\" of the dam. That is, a pr oblem with s eepage along the pipe may only become evident at a cr itical time with r espect to the amount of water stored in the impoundment. In an attempt to address potential problems with seepage along a conduit, older installations made us e of antis eep collar s. In more recent year s, filter diaphragms have been ins talled. In spite of ins talling the pipes with hand compaction of the haunch area, a practice that has led to problems in other applications, no significant problems have been attributed over the last 25 years to piping or exces sive seepage through the backfill of a decant conduit for slurry impoundments. The International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD) has prepared a number of technical publications (Bulletins Nos . 44, 74, 97, 98, 101, 103, 104, 106, and 121 [1989a, design, construction, a nd opera tion of these types of da ms (many of these have been developed in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP]). Tailings and s lurry dams have inherent differences compared to embankment dams used for the s torage and control of water. The reas ons that tailings and slurry dams do not fit within the normal context of \"embankment\" dams include (see ICOLD publications for further information): 1. They are designed to be abandoned and not operated. 2. Construction is usually simultaneous with its operation. 3. Generally cons tructed with mill tailings , mine was te, and earth- or rockfill. 4. The primary use is the dis posal of waste and s lurry from the pr ocessing operations. They usually impound water only for sedimentation, reclamation, and mill operation. Water retention is cons idered to be incidental to their intended operation of waste disposal. 5. The was te is typically dis charged along the ups tream slope of the dam, forming a delta of settled f ines, with the water pushed back away f rom the dam. 27 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams 6. The hydraulic gradient exis ting within the dam is typically les s than that existing within in a traditional embankment dam. 7. These dams often are required to impound and release water with a low pH, which can cause corrosion and deterioration of the conduit. 8. Typically, the f ree water that is impounded is a small per centage of the total s tored volume. The majority of the s tored volume is hydraulically depos ited f ine was te. 9. These dams typically cannot be breached at the end of their useful service life and the r eservoir area returned to its original condition. These dams must retain their waste products for hundreds of years. 10. These dams are often raised many times to stay ahead of the rising impoundment water. 11. These dams are normally subjected to only a nominal amount of drawdown of free water . 12. The settled fines typically provide a low permeability zone, which acts to restrict seepage. 13. Due to the much lar ger mass of these dams , decant conduits are gener ally much longer than conduits in traditional water storage dams. Some dams have conduits over 1,000 feet in length. As a result of these factors, the per formance exper ience indicates that the combination of hydraulic gradient and backfill material characteris tics may have been sufficient to prevent internal erosion and backward erosion piping problems. Also, it may be possible that particles of fine waste carried with the seepage act to choke of f potential s eepage paths . Exper ience has shown, f or example, that moving the discharge point of the slurry to a point upstream of a localized s eepage ar ea is often ef fective in eliminating the s eepage. Since these types of dams are raised concurrent with disposal, and construction occur s over the lif e of the mine, which could be a f ew year s to over 30 year s, these dams provide a unique opportunity to monitor the structural performance of decant conduits . In applications where the height of fill propos ed over the conduit creates concerns about pipe deflection, deflection is typically monitored at various intervals of fill height. Based on thes e meas urements , parameters affecting def lection, s uch as the modulus of soil reaction (E') can be back-analyzed, and future pipe deflection, and the point at which remedial actions may be required, can be better modeled and estimated. 28Introd uction The \"best practices\" provided in this document should be applied to the decant conduits installed in tailings and s lurry dams . However, thes e bes t practices creates a dilemma in the cas e of tailings and s lurry dams . As previous ly discussed, there a re benefits to ha ving a conduit tha t can tolera te some deformation in these dams. Furthermore, these impoundments do not typically have an \"impervious core,\" and the added cost of reinforced cast-in-place conduits concrete is not as suitable for the shorter life of impoundment conduits, as compared to conduits through traditional embankment type dams. While the absence of significant problems does not rule out future problems, the exis ting r ecord does provide s ome indication that alter natives to concr ete encas ement may be reas onable in tailings and s lurry impoundment applications . The following recommendations are provided for ins talling conduits in thes e types of dams: 1. Although extens ive pr oblems have not been encounter ed with decant pipes through these dams, good conduit design and installation practices need to be f ollowed. A primary recommendation is that des igners recognize the lar ge body of evidence that indicates that adequate compaction cannot be achieved in the haunch area by conventional hand held compaction methods . Using thes e methods , full contact between the pipe and the backfill cannot be ens ured. For guidance on compaction, s ee section 5.3. 2. Decant conduits should be provided with an adequately designed filter. The filter should extend far enough out from the conduit to intercept areas wher e cracks may occur due to hydr aulic f ractur ing or differential movement of backfill/embankment materials . For guidance on filters , see chapter 6. 3. The filter should not be considered as an adequate defense, by itself, agains t problems with s eepage along the conduit. The permeability of the backfill material and its level of compaction need to be s ufficient to res trict seepage and r educe the hydr aulic gr adient along the conduit. The filter is intended to collect the limited s eepage that occur s through well compacted and s uitable backfill. The filter could be overwhelmed and rendered ineffective by exces sive seepage. 4. If the pipe is not to be encased in concrete, with sloping sides that allow compaction by heavier equipment, then an alternate construction method, that provides for adequate compaction and full contact in the haunch area, needs to be s pecified. 5. Use of an alternate construction method should only be considered where it can be shown that the combination of hydraulic gradient and backfill 29 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams material char acteristics indicat e adequat e protection agains t internal erosion and backward erosion piping. 6. Whatever conduit ins tallation method is to be us ed, the s pecifications should include a detailed s tep-by-s tep procedure for ins talling the conduit and for achieving full contact with the bedding and backfill. The type of equipment to be us ed to achieve the s pecified backfill dens ities should be specified. Quality control during cons truction s hould be the res pons ibility of a regis tered profes sional engineer who is familiar with the project specifications and the potential pr oblems . The specifications should indicate how it will be deter mined that f ull contact between the conduit and the backfill has been achieved and the required backfill moisture/dens ity specifications have been met. The engineer should be required to ins pect and accept the conduit bedding and backf ill bef ore the backfill is placed over the conduit. Even though these dams differ significantly from embankment type dams, they can exper ience f ailure. Regulator y agencies , dam owner s, and des igners may find application of the guidance provided in this document can improve the overall integr ity of their structure. They should f ully cons ider the bas is for these bes t practices and decide on the applicable guidance to us e. Wher e the design and construction of a conduit through these types of dams deviates from these bes t practices , the des igner should ens ure that potential pr oblems are other wise accounted f or in the des ign. 30 Chapter 1 General Conduits have been placed through embankments for centuries. However, placing a conduit within an embankment dam incr eases the potential f or seepage and inter nal erosion or backward erosion piping. Water may seep through the earthfill surrounding the conduit, through cracks in the embankment caused by the conduit, or into or out of defects (e.g., cracks, deterioration, or separated joints) in the conduit. If the conduit is flowing under pressure, and def ects exist in the conduit, the water escaping the conduit can er ode s urrounding s oils. Replacement of a conduit through an embankment dam is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. Designers should adopt a conservative approach for the design of conduits. The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance for both constructing new conduits and renovating or replacing existing conduits in embankment dams. When eva luating existing conduits, designers should a ttempt to determine how closely the des ign of the exis ting conduit complies with cr iteria for new conduits . If the exis ting conduit lacks state-of-the-practice def ensive des ign meas ures, it may be considered inadequate by modern standards. These design measures should provide both primary and s econdary defens ive meas ures to reduce the probability of failures . Inadequate conduit designs, poor construction, and improper maintenance can adver sely af fect the s afety of embankment dams . 1.1 Historical perspective Most designers of embankment dams have attempted to include defensive design meas ures to addres s potential s eepage along conduits extending through earthfill or earth- and rockfill embankments . Even s o, many obs erved failures and accidents of embankment dams have occurred, involving conduits or the earthfill near the conduits. For large embankment dams, about one-half of all failures are due to internal erosion or backward erosion piping. In about one-half of these failures, internal erosion or backward erosion piping was known to have initiated around or near a conduit (Foster, Fell, and Spannagle, 2000, p. 1032). This means that about 25 percent of all embankment dam failures are a result of internal erosion or backward erosion piping associated with conduits. 31 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Until about the mid-1980s , the mos t common approaches for controlling s eepage were antis eep collar s (also known as cutof f collar s) and car eful compaction (s pecial compaction us ing small hand held compaction equipment) of backfill around conduits . Antis eep collar s are imper meable diaphr agms , usually of sheet metal or concrete, constructed at intervals within the zone of saturation along the conduit. They incr ease the length of the s eepage path along the conduit, which theor etically lowers the hydraulic gradient and reduces the potential for backward erosion piping. Antis eep collar s were des igned pr imarily to addr ess inter granular seepage (f low through the por e spaces of the intact s oil). Antis eep collar s did not f ully addr ess the often more serious mechanism of failure (internal erosion), that occurs when water flows through cracks and erodes the compacted earthfill near the conduit outs ide the zone of influence of the antis eep collars in the compacted earthfill near the conduits . In the 1980s , major embankment dam des ign agencies including the U.S. Ar my Corps of Engineer s (USACE), and the B ureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) discontinued us ing antis eep collar s on conduits for new dams . Reasons why antis eep collar s were abandoned include: Antiseep collars impeded compaction of soils around the conduit. Antiseep collar s contr ibuted to dif ferential s ettlement and cr eated potential hydraulic fracture zones in the fill. Designer s realized that pr oblems associated with conduits were mor e likely to be caus ed from inter nal erosion mechanis ms than f rom inter granular seepage. Designers achieved increas ed confidence in the capability and reliability of filters to prevent internal eros ion failures . Antiseep collars can form a foundation discontinuity that could result in differential s ettlement and cr acking of the conduit. The Natur al Res ources Cons ervation Ser vice (f ormerly Soil Cons ervation Ser vice, SCS) also discontinued using antiseep collars on new embankment dams, but continues to allow them on s mall, low hazar d dams and only under certain r estrictive conditions. Figures 14 through 16 show examples of the construction difficulties involved with compaction around antiseep collars. Appendix A gives a detailed history of the design rationale used for antiseep collars and reasons for their being discontinued. Figures 17 and 18 s how examples of the inef fectivenes s of antis eep collar s in preventing embankment dam failure resulting from internal erosion near conduits. 32 Chapter 1\u2014General Figure 14 .\u2014Antiseep colla rs impeded the com paction of soi ls around the condui t. Hand ta mpers wer e used nex t to the a ntiseep colla rs. Figure 15 .\u2014Com paction around a ntiseep colla rs was difficult usi ng large equipment. Most embankment dam designers, dam regulators, and dam-building agencies now recommend a zone of designed filter material surrounding the penetrating conduit. Some des igns use a filter diaphr agm located about midway between the center line of the embankment dam and downs tream toe. Other designs use a filter collar around the downs tream por tion of the conduit. Often, a chimney f ilter serves as a diaphragm to protect the conduit, as well as satisfying other functions of 33 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Figure 16 .\u2014Good com paction around a ntiseep colla rs was difficult to achieve. embankment dam design. See chapter 6 for guidance on the design and construction of filters. Since f ilters have become a s tandar d design element in embankment dam designs, very few failures have occurred that can be attributed to internal erosion or backward erosion piping near conduits. 1.2 Locating the conduit A number of factors influence the layout of a conduit, s uch as the type and cr oss section of the embankment dam, topography, geology, and hydraulics. Conduits through embankment dams are often referred to as \"cut-and-cover\" conduits. Conduits through embankment dams should be avoided, when safe and cost-effective alter natives are available. An alter native to a conduit thr ough the embankment dam is a tunnel located in the abutment, wherever geology, topography, and economics are favorable. The advantages of a tunnel include: Eliminates potential failure modes .\u2014The tunnel is not phys ically as sociated with the embankment dam. Using a tunnel completely eliminates the potential failure modes normally associated with a penetration through an embankment dam. Facilitates construction .\u2014A tunnel can often facilitate s tream divers ion around the damsite during construction. Simplifies em bankment placement.\u2014A tunnel can allow unobstructed embankment placement, s ince it no longer hinders cons truction of the earthfill. 34 Chapter 1\u2014General Figure 17 .\u2014Failure of a n embankment da m followi ng first filling. The failure wa s attributed to i nterna l erosi on beca use the ti me requi red for seepa ge to dev elop thr ough the com pacted em bankment and cause fa ilure was very sho rt. Also, the so ils are not the type o rdinarily considered suscepti ble to ba ckwa rd erosi on piping. Antiseep colla rs were not effecti ve preventi ng the fa ilure. Figure 18 .\u2014Antiseep colla rs were not a dequate to pr event the i nternal erosion failure of thi s embankment da m. The i nterna l erosi on tha t occurred o n first filling of the reservo ir occurred in dispersive c lay so ils that are not suscepti ble to ba ckward erosion piping. 35 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Eliminate s compactio n requirements.\u2014A tunnel eliminates the need f or special compaction requirements around the conduit. Allows for independent co nstructio n of tunnel .\u2014Tunnel construction can be performed independently of the embankment dam construction. Typically, the construction of the conduit through an embankment dam is a critical path feature for construction of the dam. Eliminates the need for sp ecial filters .\u2014A tunnel eliminates the need f or special f ilter placement and drainage requirements, which can typically slow the progress of embankment dam construction. However , ther e are disadvantages associated with a tunnel, s uch as : Increa sed cost.\u2014A tunnel is often more expensive than a conduit through an embankment dam. This is especially true for smaller diameter conduits. However , for larger diameter conduits or wher e pressurized s ystems are required, the r elative cos t differences can be r educed. The reduction in cos t difference is due to a les ser need f or redundant s afety features, such as steel pipe liners, special filter and drainage requirements, and more efficient embankment dam construction. Soft ground co ncerns .\u2014A tunnel may be problematic in soft ground conditions. This could result in higher design and construction costs. Also, the portal conditions must be able to accommodate the entr ance and ter minal s tructures. Potential fo r overruns .\u2014A tunnel typically involves more ris k for cos t and s chedule overruns than a conduit through an embankment dam. Requires additio nal engineering experience.\u2014Fewer engineer ing firms maintain a qualified staff for planning, design, and construction services for tunnels than for conduits through embankment dams. Constructio n data lacking .\u2014Since tunnels are not very often constructed, up-to\u00ad date construction cost data are not always readily available for comparison of costs to conduits through embankment dams. Tunnels are seldom used for small embankment dams and may be a more costly option for some larger dams. In those embankment dams, a conduit penetrating the dam may be preferred. Conduits have typically been located at about the embankment/foundation interface. They are often located so as to align the conduit discharges with the original watercourse, bypassing streamflow during construction, and potentially emptying the reservoir by gravity. This means that for many sites, the conduit is located on alluvial soils that can be deep and compressible. This also 36Chapter 1\u2014General means the conduit is often located near the maximum section of the embankment dam, which contr ibutes to gr eater structural loading on the conduit. The des igner should cons ider the f ollowing guidance in locating the conduit (Reclamation, 1987c, p. 3): Avoid differentia l settlem ent.\u2014Whenever possible, the conduit s hould be located where the profile is entirely on bedrock, or entirely on soil. Differential settlements can occur wher e the over burden soil thicknes s is extremely var iable or foundation properties differ. The bedrock profile underlying the conduit location should not have abrupt changes in a short horizontal distance. Locate the conduit in a trench .\u2014Locate the conduit in a tr ench s ection in f irm rock when the r ock is at or near the gr ound s urface (f igure 19). For this option, the construction specifications should include provisions for rock excavation to be performed to eliminate or minimize open fractures or other damage to the rock beyond the limits of the excavation. Concrete should extend to an upper limit of the top of the conduit or to the original rock surface, if lower than the top of the conduit. Locate the conduit on a bench .\u2014Locate the conduit on a bench excavated along the base of an abutment when geological conditions and topography are favorable. Placing concrete on the abutment side or placing the conduit against the excavated rock reduces or eliminates requirements for earthfill compaction against one side of the conduit (figure 20). Consider the po tential fo r nonunifo rm settlement .\u2014Foundation conditions along the length of the conduit are often nonuniform, and concentrated settlement is common in some areas. As the height of the embankment dam is raised during the construction of the dam, periodic inspection of the interior of the conduit should be performed. The frequency of such inspections should be determined based on anticipated foundation conditions as well as any uncertainties. Some conduits have experienced distress during and after construction as a result of unidentified foundation conditions. If distress is observed in the form of cracking or separation of joints, prompt remedial action is required. Reclamation has monitor ed and r ecorded thes e concentr ated s ettlements at a number of their embankment dams after construction was completed. The results of monitoring show that nonuniform settlement along the conduit is common after completion of construction. Flatten slop es where cond uits sp an a cutoff trench .\u2014Wher e a conduit s pans a cutof f trench, the s ide slopes of the cutof f trench may r equire flattening to r educe differential s ettlement between the compacted backf ill in the cutof f trench and the founda tion soils a djacent to it. 37 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Concret e (reinf orcem ent not show n Conduit Figure 19 .\u2014Condui t constr ucted i n a ro ck. 1H:10V Conc rete (reinfor cement not show n) Conduit Figure 20 .\u2014Condui t cast against ex cavated rock slope. Limit number o f conduit penetratio ns.\u2014Designs should use only one conduit, when feasible, to minimize problems associated with penetrations of the embankment dam. Installing s everal conduits , particularly near one another, compounds the construction difficulties and increases the likelihood of problems associated with conduits through the embankment dam. However, the designer should be aware that with only one conduit, if problems develop that limit the ability to contr ol the r elease of water , this may r esult in a dam s afety concer n. Therefore, the design should be robust using proven methods. Avoid locating conduit joints at discontinuities .\u2014Locate joints for the conduit wher e under lying dis continuities do not occur . If the conduit alignment inter sects a slurry trench cutoff or vertical drainage zone, the conduit should be designed wher e thes e discontinuities are not at a joint, but near the midway point between joints . For guidance on conduit joints , see section 4.3. Consider seism ic deformation.\u2014Seis mic activity can res ult in s ignificant deformation of the embankment dam. Deformations , such as settlement and s preading can open conduit joints and caus e cracking and dis placement of the conduit. Avoid the use of b ends.\u2014Loca te the conduit so tha t bends in the a lignment or profile are not required for the portion under the embankment dam. This will 38 Chapter 1\u2014General facilitate future ins pection and renovation (i.e., s liplining). This will als o provide improved compaction near the conduit and eliminate any stress concentrations resulting from the bend. Some techniques that have been found to be applicable for designing conduits on compr essible foundations include: Excavate reduce total s ettlement, excavate compr essible foundation s oils and replace with les s compr essible compacted s oil. Properly lo cate co ntrols.\u2014Position the control gates and valves upstream of im pervious zone in the embankment dam. Avoid pressurizing the cond uit.\u2014Avoiding pressurized conduits through impervious embankment dams, unless the pressure conduit is placed within a larger conduit. To prevent pr essurizing of the conduit, a f ree standing welded s teel pipe supported by cradles can be placed within a larger reinforced concrete conduit. Access is provided along the side of the steel pipe. The steel pipe is considered to be ductile and will deform and s till maintain a watertight conduit. When pos sible, f ield weld the s teel pipe joints after the initial f oundation settlement of the conduit has occur red. Bridge over wea k areas.\u2014Longitudinal reinforcement extending acros s the joints of the r einforced concr ete encas ement s urrounding the welded s teel pipe liner can provide a rigid beam effect and bridge over weak foundation areas to minimize locally concentr ated def lections . Utilize longitudinal reinforcement across joints .\u2014Large horizontal movements often occur at randomly s elected conduit joints , rather than unif ormly along the conduit length. This type of concentrated movement can open gasketed conduit joints that are not designed for large horizontal movements. The use of longitudinal r einforcement acr oss the joints and continuous welded s teel pipe liners are effective in r educing concentr ated openings within conduits . Provid e camber.\u2014A conduit that is not located on bedrock must be designed so that the a mount of predicted founda tion settlement does not da mage the conduit or its function. A conduit constructed on a compressible foundation should be camber ed to accommodate the pr edicted f oundation s ettlement, to achieve a proper final grade. In lieu of constructing tunnels or conduit penetrations through embankment dams, siphons can often provide alternative res ervoir drawdown capability for low hazard dams. Siphons are particularly useful for recreation reservoirs that do not make 39 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams regular releas es. However, proper des ign precautions must be utilized to ens ure long term performance. For guidance on the des ign of s iphons , see section 11.4.1. 1.3 Foundation inves tigations Thorough foundation investigation and interpretation of the data obtained are required to determine whether a safe and economical conduit can be built at a selected s ite. The des igner should always participate with the planning of the subsurface exploration program. Guidance for planning, conducting, and interpretation is available in Reclamation's Design of Small Dams (1987a) and Engineering Geology Field Manual (1998b), and the USACE's Geotechnical Investigations (2001a). The designer should be aware that final alignment of the conduit may require adjustment after the complete foundation has been exposed. 40 Chapter 2 Conduit Materials Various materials have been used in the design and construction of conduits through embankment dams . The reas ons for utilizing thes e different materials have included cost, availability, operations , maintenance, and cons tructability. The mos t common materials used in the construction of new and renovated conduits have been: Concrete.\u2014Reinf orced cas t-in place and and ther moset Metal .\u2014Steel, ductile iron, cas t iron, and CMP The strength and performance characteristics of each conduit material depend on its chemistry and the relationship of its components. For example, concrete is produced us ing cement, s and, aggr egates , and r einforcement, wher eas metal is a homogenous, isotropic material. Certain design and construction advantages and disadvantages are associated with each mater ial. Each mater ial requires specific des ign and cons truction considerations . Some of these mater ials, are not r ecommended f or use in the des ign and construction of conduits through significant and high hazard embankment dams. For example, CMP is seldom used in any embankment dams other than low hazard dams and needs to be carefully evaluated for the specific dam site. For guidance on the us e of specific mater ials in renovation, r eplacement, and r epair of conduits , see chapters 12, 13, and 14. 2.1 Concrete Concrete materials used in conduit construction have included: Reinforced cast-in-place Precast concrete pipe 41 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams These mater ials are discussed in the f ollowing s ections cas t-in-place concr ete is placed and allowed to cur e in the location wher e it is required to be in the completed conduit. Reinf orced cas t-in-place concr ete is made by mixing cement, fine and coarse aggregates, sand, and water. Admixtures are frequently added to the concrete immediately before or during its mixing to increase the workability, s trength, or dens ity, or to lower its freezing point. A framework of reinforcing steel is cons tructed, and f orms to contain the wet concr ete mix ar e built around the r einforcement. The wet concr ete mix is placed ins ide the f orms and around the reinforcing steel. Typically, consolidation of the concrete mix is obtained by vibration. The final solidified mass becomes reinforced cast-in-place concrete. Reinforced cast-in-place concrete conduits are built at the construction site. Figure 21 shows typical r einforcement us ed with cas t-in-place concr ete. Reinforced cast-in-place concrete conduits (figure 22) have a long history of use by the major dam des ign agencies . Reinf orced cas t-in-place concr ete conduits are ver y adaptable in their application and can be designed to fit specific project requirements and s ite conditions . A var iety of design shapes are pos sible. For guidance on selecting the pr oper shape s ee section 4.1. Properly des igned and cons tructed reinforced cast-in-place concrete should have a service life of 100 years or longer. The advantages of using reinforced cas t-in-place concr ete for conduits include: The longitudinal reinforcement typically extends acros s the conduit joints . This prevents the joint from separating and developing a leak. A variety of conduit shapes are available to provide better distribution of loadings to the founda tion. Conduit shapes can be designed to provide for good compaction of earthfill against the conduit. Allows for redundant s eepage bar rier protection, s ince water stops and reinforcement typically extends across conduit joints . Welded s teel liner s are often used to provide additional seepage barrier protection. The disadvantages of using reinforced cas t-in-place concr ete conduits include: Construction costs are often higher than for other conduit materials, particularly for s mall diameters . 42 Chapter 2\u2014Cond uit Materials Figure 21 .\u2014Rei nforcem ent bei ng unloa ded for use cast-in-pla ce concr ete. Figure 22 .\u2014Concrete placemen t for a rein forced cast-in-place conduit. Quality of concrete depends on quality control and construction inspection in the field. Aggressive water or soil chemis try can limit s ervice lif e, unles s proper precautions are taken in design. 43 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams 2.1.2 Precast concrete Precast concrete refers to concrete pipe that is cast somewhere other than its final location. Precast concr ete pipe s ections are transported to the location wher e the conduit is constructed (figure 23). Three types of precast concrete pipe have typically been used in the construction of conduits through embankment dams: reinforced concrete pipe (R CP), reinforced concrete cylinder pipe (R CCP), and prestressed concrete cylinder pipe (PCCP). Precast concr ete pipes are typically cir cular in cr oss section. Rectangular precast conduits (also known as precast concrete boxes) are seldom used in embankment dams, because joints cannot be constructed that are reliably watertight. The advantages of using pr ecast concr ete for conduits include: Manufactured to tight tolera nce in a controlled environment. Quality is unaf fected by adver se field cas ting conditions . Can be installed quickly, thus minimizing the amount of time required for stream diversion. Articulation of joints and the ability to accommodate varying s ettlement along the entire length of the conduit without high structura l stresses. The disadvantages of using pr ecast concr ete for conduits include: Longitudinal r einforcement does not extend acr oss the conduit joints . Joints can open as a result of embankment dam settlement or elongation, unless a continuous ly reinforced concrete cradle is provided along the full length of the conduit. Due to shipping and handling limitations, short pipe lengths are required to reduce weight. This will res ult in many pipe joints for the entire length of the conduit and incr ease the number of locations for potential leakage. Gasketed joint s are the only def ense agains t leakage. Compaction of earthfill is difficult under the haunches of the pipe, unles s a concrete cradle is provided. Aggressive water or chemis try can limit s ervice lif e, unles s proper precautions are taken in design. 44 Chapter 2\u2014Cond uit Materials Figure 23 .\u2014Preca st concrete pi pe bei ng unloa ded from delivery truck. Some design agencies, such as Reclamation, do not permit use of pressurized or nonpressurized precast concrete conduits through embankment dams due to concer ns with water tightnes s, the lack of longitudinal r einforcement extending acr oss conduit joints , and the difficulty of adequately compacting earthfill agains t the conduit below its springline. Other design agencies , such as NRCS, us e precast concr ete pressure (Amer W [AWWA] C300 [2004a], 301 [1999b], and 302 [2004b]) extensively for all embankment dams other than low hazard dams. The typical NRCS application is a pressure rated pipe in a nonpressurized conduit situation wher e the entr ance s tructure is an ungated r iser or tower , and the ter minal s tructure is an ungated plunge pool or s tilling bas in. Earth Da ms and Reservoirs (1990) contains NRCS design guidance for conduits in embankment dams. 2.2 Plastic Plastic pipe is often used in the renovation of conduits (e.g., sliplining or lining of existing conduits). Plastic pipe that is used in the construction of new, significant and high hazard embankment dams should always be encased in reinforced cast-in-place concrete to assure quality compaction against the conduit. Use of plastic pipe in new, low hazard embankment dams is generally limited to small diameter s (less than 12 inches ). Plastic pipe us ed in low hazar d embankment dams is often not encased in reinforced cast-in-place concrete for economic and construction-related reasons. However, use of a filter diaphragm or collar is a valuable def ensive des ign meas ure, even f or low hazar d classification s ites with favorable conditions. Some designs may not employ a filter diaphragm around the conduit, but eliminating this valuable feature s hould be carefully cons idered and justified, based on extremely favorable soil conditions, good conduit construction materials and methods, reliable construction practices, and favorable foundation conditions. Plastic pipe is generally considered to have a shorter service life 45 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams (approximately 50 to 100 years) than concrete, but may be preferred in situations wher e aggr essive water or soil chemis try could attack concr ete. Plastic pipe consists of resins composed of polymerized molecules mixed with lubricants , stabilizers , fillers , and pigments . Plastic pipe us ed in the cons truction or renovation of conduits has included thermoplastic and thermoset plastic. These mater ials are discussed f ollowing s ections . 2.2.1 Thermoplastic Thermoplas tics are ials that change s hape when heated. Thermoplas tics commonly include polyethylene (P E) and polyvinyl chlor ide (P VC). Thermoplas tic pipe is produced by the extrusion process. The extrusion process continuously forces molten polymer mater ial thr ough an angular die by a tur ning screw. The die shapes the molten material into a cylinder. After a number of additional processes, the final product is cut into the specified pipe lengths. The advantages of using thermoplastic pipe as a new conduit or for the sliplining of an exis ting conduit include: Lightweight material that facilitates installation. Resists corrosion and is not affected by naturally occurring soil and water conditions. May be preferable in certain conduit applications where aggressive water or soil chemis try would limit the lif e of concr ete or metal pipe. The smooth interior surface reduces friction loss. Also, due to the very smooth surface of thermoplastic pipe, adherence of minerals (e.g., calcium carbonate) is minimized. The ability to heat fus e PE pipe joints provides a watertight joint. Resists biological attack. The disadvantages of using thermoplastic pipe as a new conduit or for the sliplining of an existing conduit include: High coef ficient of thermal expans ion relative to concr ete can caus e movement of the s lipliner , requiring the us e of end r estraints. Can easily be damaged or displaced by construction and compaction equipment unles s it is encas ed in concrete. 46 Chapter 2\u2014Cond uit Materials Compaction of earthfill is difficult under the haunches of the pipes unles s encas ed in concrete to provide good compaction of earthfill agains t the conduit. Heat fusion of pipe joints requires special equipment and an exper ienced operator. Requires a concrete encasement for significant and high hazard embankment dams to provide a favorable s hape for compaction of earthfill agains t the conduit. Solid wall, high dens ity polyethylene (HDP E) is the mos t commonly us ed thermoplastic material for sliplining of existing conduits. Figure 24 shows an example of HDPE pipe. HDPE pipe is an inert material and as such is not subject to corrosion or deterioration, has a long service life, and requires little maintenance. This is especially important in s mall conduits that are not eas ily renovated and cannot be easily inspected. HDPE has been used in sliplining of existing conduits, since the early 1980s . HDPE is typically available in s izes up to 63 inches in diameter. The manufacturer can fabricate HDPE pipe fittings, such as bends, flanges tr ansitions . Specialized f ittings can als o be cus tom fabricated. HDPE pipe is typically black. However, HDPE pipe is also available with gray and white pigmentation to r educe glar e and impr ove conduit ins pection us ing clos ed circuit television (CCTV) equipment. For guidance on the use of HDPE pipe in conduit s liplining applications , see section 12.1.1. PVC pipe (figure 25) is not as commonly used as HDPE pipe as a conduit or slipliner due to concerns with lack of watertightness and other inherent disadvantages. The major disadvantage with PVC pipe is the bell and spigot joint connections. This type of joint connection has the potential for leakage or can separate as the embankment dam settles. The bell and spigot joint integrity must be tested for leaks to ensure that the gasket has not rolled off during installation. Use of PVC bell and spigot joints should only be considered for nonpressurized, low hazard dam applications . PVC is typically available in s izes up to 48 inches in diameter. Figure 24 .\u2014HDPE pipe to be used for sliplining of an existing condui t. 47 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Figure 25 .\u2014PVC pi pe ha s infrequently been used i n condui t applications within low ha zard embankment da ms. The bell a nd spigot joi nt connecti on used for this type of pi pe limits its use for most condui ts. 2.2.2 Thermoset plastic Thermoset plastics are rigid after manufacturing or curing and cannot be reformed. The most commonly used thermoset plastic for lining nonpressurized conduits is cured-in-place pipe (CIPP). CIPP is also referred to as an \"elastic sock.\" CIPP consists of a polyes ter needle- felt or glass fiber/felt reinforcement pr eimpr egnated with polyester resin (USACE, 2001d, p. 11). The preimpregnation process is usually done at the factory for quality control purposes. On the inner surface of the CIPP liner is generally a coating or membrane of polyester, polyethylene, surlyn, or polyurethane, depending on the type of application. The membrane provides a low friction and hydraulically efficient inner s urface to the CIPP liner. Figure 26 s hows CIPP being us ed to line an exis ting conduit. CIPP has been s uccessfully us ed in renovating deteriorated pipelines, drain pipes, and conduits through levees for over 25 years. CIPP has been used for conduit renovation through embankment dams since about the mid- 1990s . The advantages of us ing CIPP lining for conduits include: Thermoset plastic pipe is corrosion resistant and is not affected by naturally occurring soil and water conditions. Thermoset plastic pipe may be preferable in cer tain conduit applications wher e aggr essive water or soil chemis try would limit the life of concrete or metal pipe. 48 Chapter 2\u2014Cond uit Materials Figure 26 .\u2014CIPP li ner exiting from an existing condui t via the hydr ostatic inversion method. The smooth interior surface reduces friction loss. Also, due to the very smooth surface of thermoset plastic pipe, adherence of minerals (e.g., calcium carbonate) is minimized. Thermoset plastic pipe resists biological attack. Typically, the need f or grouting of the annulus between the CI PP liner and existing conduit is eliminated, s ince it is tight fitting. The disadvantages of us ing CIPP lining for conduits include: High material and installation costs. Not suited for conduits with significant bends or changes in diameter. Inability to accommodate internal and external loadings when the original conduit is severely damaged. CIPP liners are generally applicable for lining of exis ting conduits ranging in diameter from 4 to 132 inches . Maximum lengths of CIPP liner s gener ally range 49 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams from 1,000 to 3,000 f eet. CIPP liner s are bes t suited f or existing conduits that ar e not severely damaged or deformed. For guidance on the use CIPP in conduit renovation applications, see section 12.2. 2.3 Metal Metal pipes used in the construction of conduits have included: Steel Ductile-iron Cast-iron CMP These mater ials are discussed in the f ollowing s ections . 2.3.1 Steel Steel is a strong alloy of iron and carbon that contains a lower carbon content than cast iron (lower than 2 percent). The amount of carbon determines the steel's hardenability. Steel pipe is manufactured in a s hop. The manufacture s tarts with steel plate conforming to a specified ASTM International (ASTM) standard and of the pr oper thicknes s. These plates are butt welded together . The plates can be rectangular pieces that ar e rolled to the cur vature of the pipe wall, and welded together at circumferential and longitudinal joints. Another plate configuration is spiral. For this configuration, a long length of s teel plate is rolled in a s piral pattern, and welded edge to edge. Steel plate is also welded together for specials , such as typica lly hydrosta tically tested to 1\u00bd times the design pressure in the shop. Steel pipe is also often hydrostatically tested after installation. Hydrostatic testing of fittings can be per formed in the f ield af ter installation. Straight pieces of steel pipe are normally fabricated in standard 40-foot lengths, which are shipped from the s hop to the job s ite. The pieces of steel pipe ar e installed and field welded together for a rigid, water proof joint. Joint welds are checked in the f ield us ing liquid-penetrant, ultrasonic, or radiographic methods. A flanged joint can be used to provide another rigid connection, which can be disassembled and reassemble, if needed. Flanges are typically us ed with gates and valves to pr ovide a r igid connection. Flanges are also used to connect s teel pipe with ther moplas tic pipes , such as HDPE pipe. 50 Chapter 2\u2014Cond uit Materials Steel pipe with diameters 24 inches and smaller (at some shops, 36-inches and smaller) is manufactured to standard wall thickness and diameter. Pipe greater than 24 inches in diameter can be cus tom manuf actured to any des ired diameter . However, s tandard diameters are lis ted in AWWA M11 (2004c) for s teel pipe with diameter s greater than 24 inches . Minimum plate thicknes s for larger diameter s is \u00bc inch, available plate thicknes ses increas e by multiples of 1/16 inch. Steel pipe is protected with a var iety of linings and coatings . Often the inter ior lining is different from the exterior coating, because of the different exposure conditions of the inter ior and exter ior surfaces. Typically, the inter ior surface can be lined with the same paint s ystem regardless of location. The exter ior surface coating may var y, depending on location, encasement, or submergence. The exterior surface is usually bare steel, wher e encas ed in concr ete. With the pr oper coating, good s urface preparation, proper maintenance of the coating, and cathodic protection steel pipe can las t over 100 year s, and not need r ecoating f or at leas t 25 year s. The applicable coatings and linings selected to mitigate cor rosion should cons ider the velocities within the pipe. Cement mortar should only be used on the interior surfaces of steel pipe with low velocities . Steel pipe has been us ed in s ome sliplining applications (figure 27), but has more often been us ed as a liner in reinforced cas t-in-place conduits . Steel pipe has been used in s liplining of existing conduits since the 1980s . Steel pipe us ed as conduit liner has been us ed since about the ear ly 1920s . The advantages of using steel pipe for conduits include: Manufactured to a tight tolera nce in a controlled environment. Long s ervice life, if proper linings and coatings are us ed. Cathodic protection can be us ed in addition to coatings to addr ess expected holidays in the coating for effective cor rosion pr otection. Figure 27 .\u2014Steel pipe slipliner being prepared for insertion into an existing condui t. 51 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Welded joints provide watertightness and steel pipe is often used as a lining within conduits constructed on compressible foundations. High compressive and tensile strength. Flexible and deformable under stress. High modulus of elasticity to resist buckling loads caus ed by exter nal water loads or vacuum. Various types of joints possible, including butt welding, flanged, pipe coupling, and grooved-end coupling. Many of these joints permit flexibility of the pipe in cas e of expans ion, s ettlement, etc. Figure 28 shows an example of a flanged , transitions, and other specials can be fabricated. Easy to connect additional steel pipe in the future by tapping and welding. Blind flange ends can be installed for easy future additions. Flanges provide a rigid connection to gates and valves. Has the ability to be eas ily us ed as a redundant s ystem within reinforced cas t-in\u00ad place concr ete (i.e., s teel pipe located within a lar ger acces s conduit). Figure 28 .\u2014Watertight joints can be provided for steel pipe by use of flange connections. The disadvantages of using steel pipe f or conduits include: High material costs. The proper selection of linings and coatings and any associated maintenance are require d to pre vent corrosion. Requires a concrete encasement for significant and high hazard embankment dams to provide a favorable s hape for compaction of earthfill agains t the conduit. Requir es special linings at reservoirs wher e aggr essive water may exis t (i.e., acidic Chapter 2\u2014Cond uit Materials 2.3.2 Ductile-iron . Ductile-iron pipe is manufactured by centrifugal casting. A controlled amount of molten iron is introduced into the rotating mold, which generates a centrifugal force that holds the iron in place agains t the mold until it s olidifies . The pipe is then removed and furnace annealed. Ductile-iron has greater range of deformation, and is less brittle than cast-iron pipe. Ductile-iron pipe also has greater tensile and compressive strength than cast-iron pipe. Linings and coatings are required for ductile-iron pipe; commonly asphalt paint and cement-mortar lining are used. The first manufacture of ductile-iron pipe was in 1955. Ductile iron has been commonly used in utility water and s ewer systems. Ductile ir on is used inf requently in conduit applications . Ductile iron pipe is available in diameters up to 64 inches and in lengths up to 24 feet. The advantages of using ductile-iron pipe for conduits include: Manufactured to tight tolera nce in a controlled environment. Long s ervice life, if proper linings and coatings are us ed. High tensile and compressive strength. Flanged joints (figure 29) provide improved watertightness over bell and spigot connections. Figure 29 .\u2014Flanged joints of ductile iron pipe improve the wa tertightness of the joint. 53 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams The disadvantages of using ductile-iron pipe include: Ductile iron pipe is heavy and makes handling difficult. Requires a concrete encasement for significant and high hazard embankment dams to provide a favorable s hape for compaction of earthfill agains t the conduit. Requires cathodic protection in corrosive soils. 2.3.3 Cast-iron . Cast-iron is metallic iron containing more than 2 percent dis solved carbon within its matrix and less than 4.5 percent (as opposed to steel, which contains less than 2 percent). Cast-iron (figure 30) pipe cannot be wrought, so it must be manufactured by cas ting in a foundry. The molten iron is poured into a vertical annular mold. The mold is removed after the iron cools and s olidifies . Commercial availability of cas t-iron pipe typically is up to 15 inches diameter. Cast-iron pipe has been ar ound f or centur ies, and us ed for storm water and s ewer systems. The available length f or single pieces is up to 40 f eet. Many cas t-iron pipes have been in service over 100 year s. Cast-iron pipe has been used in the past for conduits through embankment dams, but is currently not cons idered acceptable f or new embankment dam cons truction by any of the f ederal dam- building agencies . The disadvantages of using cast-iron pipe include: Cast-iron pipe is heavy and makes handling difficult. Joints are bell-and-spigot. Cast-iron pipe cannot be welded, so that flanged joints are not possible. Not normally commercially available in the realm of diameters of mos t conduits. Custom fabrication would be very expensive. Lacks a favorable s hape for compaction of earthfill agains t the conduit. Cast-iron pipe is brittle and can crack, if not properly handled. 2.3.4 CMP CMP is fabricated f rom factory-produced s heet steel with cor rugations added to provide s tiffness and s trength. The sheets are typically coated with polymer s, zinc 54 Chapter 2\u2014Cond uit Materials Figure 30 .\u2014Cast iron pipe is not consi dered a ccepta ble for use i n condui t applications. (galvanized), aluminum, or aluminized zinc alloy. Additional coatings , such as bituminous, have been applied for added protection against corrosion and abrasion. CMP was first used for conduits in the late 1890s. Generally, round pipe ranges from 6 inches to 26 f eet in diameter . Other shapes and s izes of CMP are available, but have had limited applications in conduits through embankment dams. CMP is typically joined with coupling bands that extend over several corrugations on each end of two adjoining pipes. The coupling bands are designed to be mechanically tightened against the pipe corrugation via rods, lugs, angles, and bolts. A gasket mater ial is used between the band and the pipe (f igure 31). CMP has a service lif e of about 25 to 50 years. However, depending on reaction to certain soils and water conditions , ther e are cases wher e CM P has deter iorated in les s than 7 year s. Many embankment dam f ailures have been as sociated with the us e of CMP conduits . CMP has had a history of joint separations due to differential settlement, joint separations due to lateral spreading of the embankment dam, and deterioration. Major federal dam-building agencies , including NRCS, and USACE, limit their us e of CMP to low hazard embankment dams. Reclamation does not permit CMP to be used for conduits through their embankment dams. Although CMP has the advantage of being lightweight and easily installable without the need of heavy construction equipment, there are many serious disadvantages. The disadvantages of using CM P for conduits include: Deterioration has resulted in many embankment dam failures. Joint separations from differential settlement and embankment dam spreading can result in nonwatertight joints. 55 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Figure 31 .\u2014A CMP condui t being installed. Joints are often incorrectly assembled in the field, resulting in nonwatertight joints . Not applicable for pressurized conduits due to lack of watertight joints. CMP is cons idered a flexible pipe, and flexible pipe des ign requires the earthfill surrounding the pipe to provide s tructural s tability and s upport to the pipe. If the surrounding backfill does not provide adequate s upport, flexible pipes are subject to distortion and deflection. Circular shape and cor rugations on the exter ior surface makes compaction of the earthfill agains t the conduit difficult to achieve. 56 Chapter 3 Hydraulic Design o f Conduit s The discharge of water through a conduit requires a good understanding of the purpose for which the s tructure is being des igned. For instance, the inver t profile of the conduit should be sloped to provide drainage in the downstream direction. Wher e feasible, the conduit s hould dis charge at an elevation higher than the highes t tailwater or at an elevation wher e ther e is no inf luence f rom tailwater . Free flow conduits should not flow greater than 75 percent full (i.e., 75 percent of the diameter or height of the conduit) at the downstream end, to minimize the risk of surging flow developing in the conduit as the result of inadequate air for open channel flow conditions. This chapter discusses some of the pertinent aspects of hy draulic design of condui ts. For detailed guidance on hydr aulic des ign, the r eader is directed to r eferences such as Reclamation's Design of Small Dams (1987a), and USACE's Structural Design and Evaluation of Outlet Works (2003b) and Hydraulic Design of R eservoir Outlet W orks (1980). 3.1 Outlet works The main purpose of an outlet works through an embankment dam is to control the release of water from a reservoir. An outlet works typically consists of a combination of structures. The outlet works is often comprised of the some or all of the following components (this list is not all inclusive, and the type of components may vary, based on project requirements): Approach channel .\u2014The channel ups tream from the intake s tructure. This channel is generally unlined, excavated in rock or s oil, and with or without riprap, soil cement, or other types of erosion protection. Entrance structure (typically referred to as an intake structure) .\u2014A s tructure located at the ups tream end of the outlet wor ks. Entr ance s tructures often include gates or valves, bulkheads, trashracks, and/or fish screens. Conduit.\u2014A clos ed channel us ed to convey water through the embankment dam. 57 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Control features .\u2014Typically gates or valves located in the intake s tructure, conduit, gate chamber , or a downs tream structure. Terminal structure .\u2014A s tructure located at the downs tream end of the outlet works. Terminal s tructures often include gates or valves and may include s ome type of structure to dis sipate the ener gy of rapidly f lowing water and to pr otect the riverbed from erosion. Discharge channel .\u2014The channel downs tream from a ter minal s tructure. This channel conveys releases back to the \"natur al\" stream or river. This channel may be excavated in r ock or soil with or without r iprap, soil cement, or other types of erosion protection. For guidance on the des ign and cons truction of entrance and ter minal s tructures, see section 3.4. Design and construction guidance on approach and discharge channels, control features, and gate chambers are outside the scope of this document. Additional guidance relating to various components of an outlet works is available in references, such as Reclamation's Design of Small Dams (1987a), and USACE's Structural Design and Evaluation of Outlet Works (2003b) and Hydraulic Design of R eservoir Outlet Wo rks (1980). Discharge requirements through the outlet wor ks may f luctuate thr oughout the year , depending upon downstream water needs or reservoir flood control requirements. Outlet works typically serve a number of different purposes (R eclamation, 2001b): Emergency eva cuation.\u2014The outlet wor ks should be s ized to meet es tablis hed reservoir evacuation guidelines that apply f or the State in which the embankment dam was constructed or for the agency/organization responsible for the dam. For example, Reclamation (1990b, p. 13) s pecifies depths and volumes of the reservoir to be evacuated during specified timeframes based on the levels of \"risk\" (potential for an incident to occur at the dam) and \"hazard\" (level of downstream consequences as the result of misoperation and/or uncontrolled release of part or all of the reservoir). Deviation from established evacuation guidelines may be jus tified for exis ting res ervoirs if (1) the ris k associated with firs t filling of the res ervoir has passed, or (2) the ris k reduction for increasing evacuation capacity does not jus tify the cos t of modif ications . Reservoir filling ra tes.\u2014The firs t filling of a res ervoir is a critical time. Some embankment dams have failed due to hydraulic fracture caused by the pressure of water as it penetrates the embankment dam too rapidly. The rate of reservoir filling is generally regulated to monitor the res pons e of the embankment dam to incr easing hydr ostatic loading. The outlet wor ks may be required to pas s some portion of the res ervoir inflow to keep filling rates within the des ired range. Typical filling rates are in the range of 0.5 to 2 feet per day. 58Chapter 3\u2014 Hydraulic Design of Cond uits More res trictive filling rates (e.g., firs t filling) may be required when the reservoir exceeds historically high levels . The des igner must assume that f irst filling can be s udden and unexpected, and the outlet works must have s ufficient capacity to accommodate this type of event. The Picketber g and Wis ter Dam case histories in appendix B are examples of embankment dam failures that have occurred upon firs t filling of the res ervoir. Diversion .\u2014The outlet works may be utilized for the divers ion of s tream or river flows during construction of the embankment dam. The sizing of the outlet works conduit is based upon the size of the flood that might be reasonably expected to occur during construction. Historically, diversion flood capacities are in the range of 5, 10, or 20 years, with consideration given to larger flood levels, if the consequences of failure during construction are large. Operatio nal.\u2014The outlet wor ks is typically us ed to pas s downs tream release requirements , such as irrigation r eleases, envir onmental enhancement f or wetlands , fisheries, or water quality, and municipal and indus trial releas es. Flood control.\u2014The outlet wor ks may be s ized to r estrict the amount of flow that can pas s through the s ystem, ther eby s toring exces sive flood f lows in the reservoir and limiting flood flows downstream of the embankment dam. 3.1.1 Arrangement of control features Depending on the requirements of the project, the outlet works may be controlled or uncontrolled. Controlled outlet works are used at multipurpose reservoirs that provide storage for conservation, irrigation, etc. and for single-purpose flood control projects in which control of the discharge is required. Uncontrolled outlet works are used at s ome flood contr ol reservoirs, wher e predeter mined dis charges (varying with the head) are required to meet the flood control requirements. The type and size of the controls depend on the purpos es that the outlet works will s erve. The location of the contr ol features within the outlet wor ks affects the r isk associated with internal erosion and backward erosion piping incidents. Downstream control features can allow pressurized conditions to occur in the upstream portion of the conduit. Pressurized conditions create a greater potential for water es caping under pres sure, potentially eroding the s urrounding earthfill or foundation s oils. Careful cons ideration is required in s electing the location of control features. Contr ol of the outlet wor ks discharge is accomplis hed by gates and valves . The gates and valves are typically motor operated, hydraulically operated, or manually operated. Oper ators for gates and valves are typically r equired to have backup s ystems to open them under emer gency conditions . Regulating gates and valves are used to contr ol 59 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams and provide regulation of the outlet works flow. Regulating gates and valves are designed to provide a wide range of operation from closed to fully open. The closure times for gates and valves should be clos ely evaluated to keep water hammer pressures within reasonable limits. Guard gates are designed to provide closure only when the regulating gates become inoperable or when unwatering of the conduit is required to inspect or repair the section of conduit downstream of the guard gates or to inspect or repair the regulating gates. In some applications, an emergency gate may be us ed in conjunction with or in lieu of a guar d gate. An emer gency gate is typically pr ovided only as a standby or reserve gate and is used when the nor mal means of water control is not available for use. Generally, slots are provided for stoplogs or bulkheads to be installed at the conduit entrance to allow for unwatering and inspection of the conduit. In some cases, if stoplogs or bulkheads can be quickly installed during an emergency, guard gates may not be required. However, stoplogs and bulkheads are not intended for emergency closure under unbalanced conditions or when the outlet works is operating. Specially designed stoplogs and bulkheads would be required. The contr ol features should allow f or complete ins pection by man- entry or CCT V. Certain types of gates or valves (e.g., butterfly valves) can act as an obstruction and may preclude the use of robotic camera-crawler equipment, since it may not be able to pass under or around the gate or valve. Alternate access using manholes may be required to provide access around the obstruction. An important consideration in any closed conduit design for an outlet works is the proper use of air venting. Air vents can permit air to enter the conduit to prevent collaps e or to pr event the f ormation of low pr essures within f lowing water , which could lead to cavitation and its possible attendant damage. Air vents can also be used to bleed air from a conduit prior to operation. Figure 32 shows an example of an air vent leading from the conduit that daylights onto the surface of the embankment dam. For guidance on the location, air flow r ates, and s tructural considerations of air vents, see R eclamation's Air-Water Flow in Hydraulic Structures (1980). The location f or the contr ol of the outlet wor ks can be placed at the ups tream end of the conduit, at the downs tream end, or at s ome intermediate point. For illus trative purposes, four arrangements for locating the contr ol features within the outlet wor ks have been adapted from R eclamation's Design of Small Dams (1987a, p. 446): Arrangement 1\u2014I ntermediate contr ol 2\u2014I ntermediate contr ol without downs tream acces s (figure 34) Arrangement 3\u2014Upstre am control (fig ure 35) 60 Chapter 3\u2014 Hydraulic Design of Cond uits Figure 32 .\u2014An air ve nt is required in closed condui ts downstr eam from the contr olling gate or va lve to prevent colla pse or the formation of low air pressu res. Arrangement 4\u2014Downs tream contr ol (figure 36) These arrangements are discussed in the f ollowing s ections . Figures 33 thr ough 36 illustrate the arrangement of control features only. The internal zoning of the embankment dam's filters and drains are not shown in these figures. 3.1.1.1 Arrangement 1\u2014In termediate control with downstream access In this type of a rrangement (figure 33), a control ga te or va lve (i.e., gua rd or gua rd and regula ting) is loca ted at an intermedia te point (typica lly at or upstrea m of the embankment dam center line) between the intake and the ter minal s tructures, with additional regulatory gate(s) or valve(s) located downstream in a control house. The specific aspects of this arrangement ar e: Flow conditions .\u2014Pressure flow would exis t ups tream of the inter mediate contr ol. Pressure flow could als o exist downs tream of the inter mediate contr ol, if the regulating gate in the control hous e is partially or fully clos ed. 61 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Figure 33 .\u2014Arrange ment 1\u2014Intermediate control with downst ream ac cess.\u2014The contr ol feature is located a t an intermediate poi nt within the condui t.

Figure 35 .\u2014Arrange ment 3\u2014Upstream control.\u2014The contr ol feature is located a t the upstrea m end of the condui t. Figure 36 .\u2014Arrange ment 4\u2014Downst ream control.\u2014The contr ol feature is located at the downstrea m end of the condui t. 62 Chapter 3\u2014 Hydraulic Design of Cond uits Figure 37 .\u2014A steel pi pe is located wi thin a larger downstrea m access co nduit. Access .\u2014The outlet works can be operated through an interior conduit (typically a steel pipe), which is located within the lar ger downs tream acces s conduit while the downstream portion of the conduit is inspected. Figure 37 shows an example of this type of arrangement. Access for inspection and maintenance of the lar ger downs tream acces s conduit can be mor e frequent with this arrangement. Acces s for inspection and maintenance of the conduit ups tream of the intermediate point can be limited (i.e., bulkheads must be installed). Emerg ency closure.\u2014Emer gency clos ure is possible at the inter mediate contr ol point. Risk.\u2014This type of arrangement is typically used for high embankment dams with s ignificant to high downs tream cons equences . This arrangement is considered to have les s risk than arrangements 2, 3, and 4, s ince the ability exists to pr ovide clos ure at an inter mediate location. Since the exter nal and internal hydr ostatic pr essures are usually balanced ups tream of the inter mediate control, the development of a defect in the conduit in this area will be les s of potential pr oblem. The conduit located within the lar ger downs tream acces s conduit provides another degree of protection, s ince the ability to ins pect allows for problem detection. 63 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams 3.1.1.2 Arrangement 2\u2014Intermediate control without downstream access In this type of a rrangement (figure 34), ga tes or va lves a re loca ted at an intermedia te point (typically at or upstream of the embankment dam center line) between the intake and the ter minal s tructures. The specific aspects of this arrangement ar e: Flow conditions .\u2014Pressure flow exists upstrea m of the intermedia te control, a nd open channel flow exists downstream of the intermediate control. Design consid erations.\u2014The internal pressure upstre am from the intermediate control is approximately equal to the full res ervoir head. The internal and external hydros tatic pres sures will be clos ely balanced, and the potential for leakage into or out of the conduit will be minimized. As external hydros tatic pressure around the conduit diminis hes with incr easing dis tance f rom the reservoir, there may be exces s inter nal pressure, and the conduit mus t be kept water tight to avoid leakage thr ough joints or cracks, which could allow water to be forced out of the conduit and into the surrounding soils. Normal practice limits the length of the pressure portion of a conduit to that part of the conduit upstream from the crest of the embankment dam or to approximately the upstream third of the dam. The upstream conduit should be designed to resist the full exter nal hydr ostatic pr essure when it is dewater ed for inspection or maintenance. The use of a steel liner for the ups tream conduit s hould be considered, whenever there is concer n regarding the water tightnes s of a pressure conduit. Access .\u2014Acces s for inspection and maintenance of the downs tream conduit can be limited, s ince the gates or valves located at the inter mediate point mus t be closed. Once clos ed, the downs tream conduit can be acces sed. However , the upstream conduit will r emain inundated. Acces s to the ups tream conduit requires bulkheading of the conduit entr ance. Acces s to the gates or valves (normally located within a s tructure called a gate chamber) is typically provided through an acces s shaft from the cr est of the embankment dam. Emerg ency closure.\u2014Emer gency clos ure is possible at the inter mediate contr ol point. Typically, this type of arrangement provides tandem gates or valves located at the inter mediate contr ol point. The ups tream gate or valve s erves as a guard, and the downstream gate or valve provides regulation. Risk.\u2014This type of arrangement is typically used for high embankment dams with s ignificant to high downs tream cons equences . This arrangement is considered to ha ve more risk tha n arrangement 1, but less risk tha n arrangements and 3 and 4, s ince the ability exis ts to provide clos ure at an intermedia te tion. Since the externa l and interna l hydrosta tic pressures a re 64 Chapter 3\u2014 Hydraulic Design of Cond uits usually clos ely balanced ups tream of the inter mediate contr ol, the development of a defect in the conduit in this area will be les s of potential problem. 3.1.1.3 Arrangement 3\u2014Upstream control In this type of a rrangement (figure 35), the ga tes or va lves a re loca ted at or immediately downs tream of the intake s tructure. The specific aspects of this arrangement ar e: Flow conditions .\u2014Open channel (free-flow) flow exists throughout the conduit downs tream from the gates or valves . Design consid erations.\u2014Des igned f or exter nal loadings and outs ide water pressures on the conduit. Near full res ervoir head will be exerted on the exterior of the conduit until adequate thickness of impervious embankment is provided over the conduit. Due to lar ge exter nal hydr ostatic pr essure, the conduit must be kept watertight to avoid leakage through joints or cracks, which could allow embankment mater ials to be car ried into the conduit. Access .\u2014Acces s for inspection and maintenance is greater than ar rangements 1, 2, or 4 (i.e., clos ing the gates or valves allows inspection of almos t the entir e conduit. An upstream bulkhead must be installed to inspect the upstream side of the gates or valves and the remaining portion of conduit). In most cases, this type of arrangement requires an intake tower and access bridge for gate or valve operation or bulkhead installation, which add significant design and construction cos ts, especially in ar eas with potentially high s eismic activity. Figure 38 shows an example of a footbridge. Sometimes submerged intake structures containing gates or valves have been us ed ins tead of intake tower s. Emerg ency closure.\u2014Emer gency clos ure is provided at the intake s tructure upstrea m of the regula ting ga te or va lve. Risk.\u2014This type of arrangement is considered to have more risk than arrangements 1 a nd 2, but less tha n arrangement 4. If the conduit develops a defect downstream from the intake structure, a high pressure differential will exist due to the externa l hydrosta tic pressure from the full reservoir hea d and no inter nal pressure within the conduit. A conduit def ect in the ar ea downs tream from the intake s tructure could r esult in water flowing into the conduit. In this arrangement, no emer gency clos ure exis ts downs tream from the intake s tructure. Another factor for the higher risk assignment is the potential for the free-flow conduit not being properly sized and operation resulting in a pressurized condition. If the conduit is properly sized and operated, this arrangement does not have the concern with high pressure flow being forced out of the conduit then into the s urrounding fill. 65 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Figure 38 .\u2014A footbr idge or access bridge is often r equired to oper ate gates or valves loca ted a t the i ntake tower. The use of upstream control without an intake tower is common on low hazard embankment dams . In this application, an inclined s lide gate is located on the upstream face of the embankment dam. The gate stem is often buried to avoid damage from ice floating in the reservoir or by vandalism. Trashracks are located on the inta ke structure to prevent plugging of the conduit with debris. An alterna tive to the gate stem would be the use of a hydraulic gate operator. For this application, instead of the gate stem extending from the top of the embankment dam to the gate, a hydraulic cylinder is mounted in the intake s tructure. Hydraulic lines buried within the upstream face of the embankment dam connect to a manual pump and hydraulic reservoir a t the crest. 3.1.1.4 Arrangement 4\u2014Downstream control In this type of a rrangement (figure 36), ga tes or va lves a re loca ted at or just upstrea m of the ter minal s tructure (on the downs tream side of the embankment dam). The specific aspects of this arrangement ar e: Flow conditions .\u2014Pressure flow exists throughout the entire length of conduit from the intake s tructure to the gates or valves at the ter minal s tructure. Design consid erations.\u2014The external hydrostatic pressure around a conduit normally diminis hes with incr easing dis tance f rom the r eservoir. At the downs tream por tion of the pr essure conduit, ther e may be exces s inter nal hydrostatic pressure. The potential exists for leakage out of the conduit 66 Chapter 3\u2014 Hydraulic Design of Cond uits through joints or cracks. A steel pipe liner is normally used with pressure conduits. Access .\u2014Acces s for inspection and maintenance can be s eldom (i.e., either the reservoir must be drained, or divers must perform inspections after gates or valves are clos ed, or the conduit mus t be unwater ed after an ups tream bulkhead is installed). At some sites, a submerged upstream gate or valve is provided for closure to f acilitate acces s for inspection. Arrangement 4 is discouraged unles s the embankment dam is low hazar d with minimal downs tream cons equences . Emerg ency closure.\u2014Emergency closure is typically not possible upstream of the contr ol point, unles s a submer ged intake s tructure with a mechanically or hydraulically operated gate or valve is provided. Risk.\u2014This type of arrangement is considered to have more risk than arrangements 1, 2, and 3. If the conduit develops a defect upstream from the downs tream control s tructure, a high pres sure differential will exis t due to the internal hydrostatic pressure from the full reservoir head and the lack of exter nal hydr ostatic pr essure. A conduit def ect in the ar ea ups tream from the contr ol structure could r esult in water flowing out of the conduit. In this arrangement, no emer gency clos ure exis ts upstream from the Even if an ups tream emer gency clos ure gate is provided in a s ubmer ged intake structure, a leak f rom a def ect in the conduit may not be identif ied in time to prevent an embankment dam failure. 3.2 Spillway Spillways utilizing conduits are generally s haft or drop inlet type. These types of spillways typically cons ist of an entrance (cres t) structure with or without control devices, a conduit, and a terminal structure. Figure 39 shows an example of a drop inlet type of s pillway called a morning glory. The drop s pillway is often referred to as a \"principal s pillway.\" Figure 40 s hows an example of a ris er structure for a principal spillway. A spillway provides flood control regulation for floods , either in combination with an outlet works , or as the only flood control facility. Typically, the spillway is used to releas e surplus water or floodwater that cannot be contained in the allotted res ervoir s torage s pace. The discharge capacity of a s pillway conduit is determined by the results of flood routings and is influenced by the flood surcharge volume available above the s pillway cres t. Where little flood s urcharge volume is available, the s pillway mus t be large enough to pas s the peak of the flood. If the reservoir has a large storage capacity above the normal water surface, a portion of the flood volume can be retained temporarily, and the s pillway dis charge capacity may be considerably r educed. 67 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Figure 39 .\u2014A drop inlet spi llway condui t through an embankment da m. Ideally, the s pillway s hould be des igned to operate with cres t control throughout the entire expected r ange of discharge. However , the r ange of expected dis charge is based on the current hydrologic data. Spillway flood flow rates may change due to updated probable maximum precipitation quantities; changes in the basin runoff characteristics could var y significantly with time; and the pr oject oper ation may be revised at a future date, which may res ult in an increas e above the original s pillway design flow. Any of these factors, separately or in combination, could be s ufficient to caus e a spillway des igned for cres t control to s hift to conduit control in the upper range of expected dis charge. The spillway conduit is cons idered a clos ed channel and generally takes the form of a vertical or inclined shaft connected to a horizontal or sloped conduit. In mos t cases, a spillway conduit is designed to flow partly full throughout the entire length. Another condition that could cause the control shift at essentially any discharge is partial plugging of the conduit. Plugging could occur either by external debris (i.e., logs or ice) or an internal problem resulting from cavitation damage. To ensure free flow in the conduit, the ratio of flow depth to conduit diameter or height should be limited to about 75 percent or less. Some sites have utilized log booms or specially des igned tras hracks that reduce s urface currents to prevent floating debris from entering the conduit. Additionally, air vents may be required to ensure adequate air supply is provided to prevent unstable flow in the conduit. In areas wher e high velocity f low may occur , aeration of the f low may be required to prevent ca vitation da mage. 68 Chapter 3\u2014 Hydraulic Design of Cond uits Figure ructure for a prin cipal spillway. Spillways utilizing conduits are not applicable to all s ites, and an open channel overflow s pillway or tunnel may be preferable. The limitations of a s pillway utilizing a conduit include: The required flood dis charge capacity may neces sitate a lar ge diameter conduit or multiple conduit barrels. The size and shape of the conduit can have undes irable cons equences , since it r epresents a dis continuity thr ough the embankment dam. Future incr eases in the s ize of the des ign flood ar e difficult to accommodate with a s pillway conduit. Discharge capacity limitations of conduit may require the us e of an auxiliary or emergency s pillway to provide required flood control capability. 3.3 Power conduits Power conduits (also known as \"penstocks\") are used to transport water from an intake s tructure located in the res ervoir to a downs tream facility for the generation of power. Figure 41 shows an example of penstocks extending through an embankment dam. The power conduit typically operates in a pressurized condition. The power conduit is usually cons tructed of steel pipe encas ed by r einforced 69 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Figure 41 .\u2014Penstocks ex tendi ng through an embankment da m. cast-in-place concr ete. Power conduits are often combined with the outlet wor ks conduit by the us e of a wye br anch to the power plant. Power conduits are nor mally designed and cons tructed with the s ame cr iteria used for outlet wor ks conduits through embankment dams. 3.4 Entrance and terminal s tructures Entrance and ter minal s tructures are placed at the ups tream and downs tream ends of conduits , respectively. Entrance s tructures are often referred to as intake s tructures for outlet works and inlet s tructures for s pillways . Properly des igned entrance and terminal structures are important to the safe operation of the conduit. Figures 42 and 43 s how typical intake and ter minal s tructures for an outlet wor ks conduit. Figures 44 and 45 s how examples of outlet wor ks wher e no entr ance and ter minal structures have been provided. In both of the situations shown in figures 44 and 45, serious dam s afety def iciencies exist, since the ups tream entr ance could become plugged or the downs tream toe of the embankment dam could er ode. Reclamation's Design of Small Dams (1987a, p. 451) provides a good source of information concer ning pur pose and des ign cons iderations for entrance and ter minal s tructures. The following has been adapted f rom that r eference: Intake structures.\u2014In a ddition to forming the entra nce to the conduit, a n intake s tructure may accommodate contr ol devices , bypas s devices ), and include temporary diversion openings and provisions for installation of bulkhead or stoplog closure devices. 70 Chapter 3\u2014 Hydraulic Design of Cond uits Figure 42 .\u2014Typical outlet w orks intake structure. Figure 43 .\u2014Typic al outlet works terminal structure. The type of intake structure selected should be based on several factors: the functions it must serve, the range in reservoir head under which it must operate, the dis charge it mus t handle, the f requency of reservoir drawdown, the tr ash and debris conditions in the res ervoir (which will determine the need for or the frequency of cleaning of the trashracks), reservoir ice conditions or wave action that could affect the s tability, and other s imilar cons iderations . Depending on its function, an intake s tructure may be either submer ged or extended in the form of a tower above the maximum r eservoir water surface. A tower must be provided if the controls are placed at the intake, or if an operating platform is needed for tras h removal, maintaining and cleaning fis hscreens , talling stoplogs . tructure serves only as an entr ance to the conduit and 71 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams Figure 44 .\u2014No i ntake structure exists for this outlet w orks.

The em bankment around the ex it porta l has experienced significant erosion. 72 Chapter 3\u2014 Hydraulic Design of Cond uits wher e trash cleaning is ordinar ily not r equired, a s ubmer ged s tructure may be appropriate. The conduit entr ance may be placed ver tically, inclined, or horizontally, depending on intake requirements . Where a s ill level higher than the conduit level is desired, the entr ance can be a dr op intake s imilar to the entr ance of a drop inlet s pillway. A vertical entrance is usually provided for intakes at the conduit level. In certain ins tances , an inclined intake s tructure may be placed along the upstream slope of the dam or along the reservoir bank upstream of the da m. The des igner should exer cise caution in the des ign of the tr ashracks for the intake structure. As releases are made thr ough the intake s tructure, debr is can accumulate on the tras hracks . Continued accumulation of debris will gradually begin to clog the trashracks to a point where the internal and external hydrostatic pressures on the intake s tructure and conduit ar e no longer balanced. Unles s these structures have been properly designed to resist this type of loading, the pressure differential may cause a collaps e of the s tructures. Another concer n the des igner should be awar e of is the accumulation of sediment and debris in the reservoir. Severe storms can wash tree stumps a nd othe r large debris (e .g., logs) into the reservoir. Also, if a forest fire occur s in the water shed, this can caus e mud, as h, and debr is to enter the r eservoir. For tra shracked inta ke structures, this debris ca n accumula te on the tra shracks and clog them. For intake structures without trashracks, this can result in plugging of the conduit. The lack of regular testing of gates and valves and reservoir flushing can contribute to this situation. For flood control conduits, the clogging or plugging can result in loss of discharge capacity, which could lead to overtopping of the embankment dam. Clogging and plugging can also affect the operation of downs tream turbines (ICOLD, 1994a). Reclamation's Design of Small Dams (1987a, p. 452) provides a good source of information concerning terminal structures. The following has been adapted from that reference: Terminal structures.\u2014The discharge from a conduit, whether it be pressure or free flow, will emerge at a high velocity, us ually in a nearly horizontal direction. If erosion-resistant bedrock exists at shallow depths, the flow may be discharged directly into the river. Otherwise, it should be directed away from the toe of the embankment dam by a def lector . Wher e erosion could be a potential problem, a plunge basin may be excavated and lined with riprap or concrete. When more energy dissipation is required, the hydraulic jump basin is most often used for energy dissipation of discharges. However, flow that emerges in the form of a free jet, as is the cas e for valve- contr olled outlets of pressure 73 Cond uits th rough Embankment Dams conduits, must be directed onto the transition floor approaching the basin so it will become uniformly dis tributed before entering the bas in. Otherwis e, proper energy dissipation may not be obtained. For further guidance on the design and construction of entrance and terminal structures, see Reclamation's Design of Small Dams (1987a), and USACE's Strength Design for Reinforced Concrete Hydraulic Structures (1992), Hydraulic Design of R eservoir Outlet Works (1980), a nd Structural Design and Evaluation of Outlet Works (2003b). 74 Chapter 4 Structural Design of Conduits Conduits through embankment dams differ from nonwater-retaining structures. Conduits have many unique structural design requirements, which the designer must consider in any des ign. These requirements include: Cracking must be minimized to avoid the effects of internal erosion and backward eros ion piping. Minimizing cracking will als o reduce the vulnerability of reinforcement cor rosion. Also, conduits located on weak or compr essible foundations must remain watertight during horizontal and vertical movements caused by s ettlement and s preading of the embankment dam. High velocity flow can result in cavitation or erosion. Flow within conduits can f luctuate over the year , depending on pr oject require ments. Due to the r elease requirements of the downs tream us ers, conduits may be difficult to shut down for frequent maintenance or repair. Tight tolerances are required to maintain properly functioning gates and valves. The following sections discuss some of the important aspects to consider in the structural design of the conduit. For additional guidance on the structural design of conduits , see Reclamation's Design of Small Dams (1987a), and USACE's Structural Design and Evaluation of Outlet Works (2003b) and Culverts, Conduits, and Pipes (1998a). 4.1 Conduit s hape The primary cons iderations in selecting the pr oper shape of the conduit ar e: To promote good compaction of earthfill agains t the conduit 75 Conduits through Embankment Dams To eliminate or minimize the impacts of low dens ity ar eas caus ed by dif ficulties in compaction of the earthfill To eliminate or minimize the potential for stress arching in the embankment dam leading to low density zones and hydraulic fracture of the dam To eliminate or minimize the potential for differential s ettlement leading to low density zones and maintain a positive embankment pressure on the conduit To allow acces s for periodic ins pection by either man- entry or CCT V To allow for future repairs, renovation, or changes in operating requirements To allow for the mos t economical s tructural des ign while s till addres sing all of the items above cons iderations Depending on the arrangement of the control features, type of conduit, purpose of the conduit, etc., s pecific shapes are used. Figures 46 thr ough 50 s how examples of shapes typically us ed for single bar rel reinforced cas t-in-place concr ete conduits . Figure 51 represents a shape commonly us ed with pr ecast concr ete conduits . A box shape has been us ed in both r einforced cas t-in-place and pr ecast concr ete applications (Note: Most box shaped conduits have used vertical sidewalls. However , figure 52 shows a preferred shape with s loping s idewalls ). A filter is Figure 46 .\u2014Conduit shape A Figure 47 .\u2014Conduit shape B Figure 48 .\u2014Conduit shape C Figure 49 .\u2014Conduit shape D Figure 50 .\u2014Conduit shape EFigure 51 .\u2014Conduit shape F 76 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits Figure 52 .\u2014Conduit shape G needed with any s hape of conduit s elected. A filter provides a defense against internal erosion and backward erosion piping resulting from differential settlement of the conduit, hydraulic fracture of the embankment, or deterioration of the conduit. See chapter 6 for guidance on the des ign and cons truction of filters . In some special situations, double or triple barrel conduits may be required. Operational and/or flow capacity requirements usually determine the numbe r of ba rrels require d. Struc tural design of multibarrel conduits should adhere to the guidance in this section. Figure 53 shows an example of a double barrel conduit under construction. The following s ections discuss conduit s hapes that have been us ed by the major embankment dam design organizations. 4.1.1 Conduit s hapes A, B, and C Conduit sha pes A, B, a nd C (figures 46-48) tend to be less a daptable to cha nges in loading and s tresses than f ully cir cular sections , but pr ovide an exter ior surface that is superior for compacting earthfill materials agains t. Depending on the loading, stress concentrations may be large enough in or near the base that shear stirrups may be required or concrete thicknesses must be increased. Figures 54, 55, and 56 s how the inter iors of conduit s hapes A, B , and C, r espectively. Conduit shape A is typically used for pressure flow. Conduit shapes B and C are typically used for nonpressurized flow conditions. Conduit shapes B and C are also used as the lar ger downs tream acces s conduit in ar rangement 1, as discussed in Figure 53 .\u2014A multibarrel outlet wor ks condui t under constr uction. 77 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 54 .\u2014An example of the i nterior of condui t shape A.

The steel pipe located within these types of conduits is supported on concrete saddles as shown in figure 57. Interior and exterior shapes that are curved can better accommodate high earthfill and water loads . Conduit s hapes with flat interior bottoms are generally only us ed where limited loadings are applied to the conduit. The sides of conduit shapes A, B, and C should be sloped to 1H:10V or more through the im pervious zone of the embankment dam to allow equipment to compact the earthfill directly agains t the conduit. Contractors may us e straight cords to avoid us ing cur ved forming techniques for the exter iors of shapes A, B , and C. If straight cor ds are used, the des igner must ensure that s tress concentr ations do not change and adequate concrete thickness is provided. 4.1.2 Conduit s hape D Conduit sha pe D (figure 49) ha s structura l attributes simila r to those of the circula r section (i.e., tends to be more adaptable to changes in loading and stre sses that may be caus ed by unequal fill or foundation s ettlement). The interior of s hape D will be similar to the shapes in figure 54. The sides of the condui t shoul d be sloped to 1H:10V or more through the impervious zone of the embankment dam to allow equipment to compact the earthfill directly agains t the conduit. Contractors may us e straight cor ds to avoid us ing cur ved forming techniques for the exter ior of this shape. If straight cor ds are used, the des igner must ensure that s tress concentr ations do not change and adequate concrete thickness is provided. 79 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 57 .\u2014Concrete sa ddles a re used to support steel pi pe loca ted wi thin a larger access condui t. 4.1.3 Conduit s hape E Conduit shape E (figure 50) is formed by separating two semicircular sections by short side sections. Figure 58 shows an example of the interior of conduit shape E. Conduit s hape E generally achieves maximum economy of materials by mobilizing more of the relieving fill pres sure. The sides of the conduit s hould be s loped to 1H:10V or more through the im pervious zone to a llow equipment to compa ct the earthfill directly agains t the conduit. Contractors may us e straight cords to avoid using cur ved forming techniques for the exter ior of this shape. If straight cor ds are used, the des igner must ensure that s tress concentr ations do not change and adequate concrete thickness is provided. 4.1.4 Conduit s hape F An ext ernally s haped cir cular conduit is more adapt able to changes in loading and stresses that may be caus ed by unequal fill or foundation s ettlement (i.e., better distribution of loads). As a flow surface, a circular internal cross section is used primarily for pres sure flow conditions , since it is a very hydraulically efficient s hape. The inter ior of a cir cular conduit would be s imilar to figure 54. The use of an externally shaped circular conduit through an embankment dam should be carefully evaluated due to concerns with the difficulty or inability to uniformly compact the earthfill around the conduit. Precas t concrete pipe is the mos t often us ed externally shaped circular conduit. The earthfill beneath the haunches of the conduit cannot be adequately compa cted with pneuma tic tired equipment a nd requires compa ction with hand held tampers. Efforts to obtain proper compaction using hand tampers could cause movement or displacement of smaller conduits. Improper compaction of the earthfill around the conduit and movement of the conduit can res ult in differential 80 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits Figure 58 .\u2014An example of the i nterior of condui t shape E. settlement and hydr aulic f ractur e. The use of exter nally s haped cir cular conduits differs between the major dam building agencies . Reclamation does not us e exter nally s haped cir cular conduits in their designs due to concer ns about the inadequate compaction of earthfill agains t the conduit. NRCS allows use of exter nally s haped cir cular conduits , if they ar e cons tructed on cr adles or bedding. The use of exter nally s haped cir cular conduits (e.g., pr ecast concr ete pipe) r equires thorough inspection and strict adherence to proper construction techniques to achieve quality as surance of earthfill compaction. Figure 51 s hows an externally shaped circular conduit on a cradle. The sides of the cradle should be sloped to 1H:10V or more through the im pervious zone of the embankment dam to allow equipment to compact the earthfill directly agains t the conduit. For guidance on the use of cradles and bedding, s ee section 4.1.6. 4.1.5 Conduit s hape G A box (or rectangular ) shape has historically been us ed by s ome agencies , such as the NRCS. Other agencies , such as Reclamation, no longer use this shape due to the objectionable consequences. Box shapes using both reinforced cast-in-place and precast concr ete have been us ed in the pas t with var ying degr ees of success. The shape s hown in figure 52 illus trates a box s hape with the preferred 1H:10V or more side slopes for improved compaction of earthfill agains t the conduit. Historically, the box shape has use d vertical sides. The designer must ful ly consider the 81 Conduits through Embankment Dams advantages and disadvantages of this shape before making a final selection for use. Figure 59 shows an example of the interior of a box shape. The advantages of a box s hape include: The flow capacity of a box shaped conduit is typically greater than other shapes. Using one conduit large enough to convey the design flow is preferable to having multiple smaller conduits penetrating the embankment. Other shapes may be mor e costly becaus e of the mor e complicated f orming required. However, contractors often submit a request to use a series of straight chords in lieu of constructing the circular outside cross section to avoid using cur ved forming techniques . This request is usually acceptable, as long as the thicknes s requirements for the par ticular shape ar e not compr omised. Forming the tr ansition s ection between inlet r isers and box s haped conduits is easier than the f orming required for the tr ansition s ection and cir cular conduits . The disadvantages of a box shape include: Stress concentr ations occur within the concr ete at the cor ners of the box. Reinforcement designs must thoroug hly address thi s issue. Arching of the embankment fill is more likely for the box s haped conduit. This may result both i n stress concentrations a nd low lateral stresses favorable to hydraulic fracture in zones of the earthfill s urrounding the conduit. The filter diaphr agm or chimney f ilter design for this shape conduit may need to be mor e robust than for conduits with more favorable configurations for these reasons. The sharp outside corners at the top of the box shaped conduit can cause undes irable s tress concentrations in the fill. Small tens ion zones occur in the fill adjacent to the upper portions of the conduit. The tens ile stresses that develop may caus e formation of tens ion cracks in the fill. These cracks , combined with the pos sibility that fill will pull away from the s ide walls (unles s they are sloped), may induce internal erosion near and along the conduit. Casagrande and Covarrubias (1970, p. 17) discuss the problems with uneven stress levels in earthfill next to vertical walls trans verse to embankments in more detail. While reinforced cast-in-place concrete conduits with a box shape have been used with suitable precautions, using box-shaped precast concrete conduits is discouraged in embankment dam design. Constructing precast concrete conduits with joints that are adequately watertight is difficult. Even if joint fillers are us ed in the joints , the probable movement of articulated joints of this 82 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits Figure 59 .\u2014A box shape is not com monly used for condui ts. The desi gner needs to ca refully consi der the a dvantages and disadvantages of thi s shape. shape is likely to result in poor watertightness. Reinforced cast-in-place box conduits are des igned with r einforcement extending acr oss the joint and waterstops to improve watertightness. The economy in the box shape is typically due in part to the straight sides, making forming less expensive, and the flat bottom, making foundation excavation eas ier. However , best practice f or compaction r equires the s ides of the conduit to be sloped to 1H:10V or more through the im pervious zone of the embankment dam to allow equipment to compact the earthfill directly against the conduit. The preferred shape for a box conduit is shown in figure 52. 4.1.6 Cradles and bedding Externally shaped circular conduits should be constructed on concrete cradles to avoid problems with compacting beneath the haunches of the conduit. Cradles are typically used in conjunction with precast concrete pipe. The cradle should be formed concrete that provides vertical, longitudinal, and lateral structural support to the conduit. The cradle should extend for the full length of the conduit and should encas e the lower half of the conduit extending up to the s pringline. Conduit s hape F illustrates a circular conduit with a concrete cradle extending up to the s pringline. The des ign of the conduit s upport through an embankment dam will depend upon the hazard clas s potential as sociated with the dam, compres sibility of the foundation, 83 Conduits through Embankment Dams and the use of the conduit. As noted previously, precast concrete pipe should not be used in pressurized applications within significant and high hazard embankment dams , becaus e failure of a s ingle pipe joint or joint gas ket could allow pres surized water to come in direct contact with the embankment. Conduits should be constructed on rock or firm foundations whenever possible. When a conduit is founded on a compressible foundation, the designer must exercise care in design of the conduit becaus e of the lar ge settlements that can occur . These settlements can open joints and caus e pipe joints to fail. Different approaches have been used to design conduits on compressible founda tions. NRCS uses a joint design for the cra dle tha t allows the a rticula tion a nd spreading of the conduit and its support system. To allow for joint articulation, the joint is placed at the location of the pipe joint and cradle reinforcement is not allowed to pas s through the joint. In addition, the s paces between joints are filled with a compressible material, such as high-density sponge rubber or bituminous fiberboard to allow for articulation of the cradle joints . The NRCS des ign guidelines for the configuration of pipe cradles are provided in The Structural Design of Underg round Co nduits (1958). Reclamation does not allow precast concrete pipe to be used for conduits within embankment dams and ther efore would not us e cradles . The concrete cradle should bond to the conduit. The sides of the concrete cradle should always be sloped at 1H:10V or flatter through the im pervious zone to allow equipment to compact earthfill directly agains t the cradle. There should be no s harp or protruding cor ners associated with the cr adle that could caus e undes irable stress concentrations in the fill. Blocks and wedges are required to s upport the conduit on grade until the concr ete cradle has been placed and cur ed. Designers of conduits through low hazard embankment dams often use concrete bedding beneath fully circular conduits. Bedding generally comes up to about 25 percent of the conduit height to provide s upport and facilitate compaction under the haunches. Bedding often has joints located at the circular pipe joints so as to not interfere with pipe movement. Figure 60 shows a precast circular conduit using bedding for support. For guidance on the use of bedding in conjunction with fully circular conduits , see NRCS's The Structural Design of Underground Conduits (1958) and USACE's Culverts, Conduits , and Pipe s (1998a). The selection of whether to us e cradles or bedding is typically a function of the height of the embankment dam. Cradles are often used for higher dams, where more lateral support is required. Regardless of whether a cradle or bedding is used, the us e of a filter diaphr agm or collar is a valuable def ensive des ign meas ure that s hould be employed, even f or low hazar d classification sites with favorable conditions. The designers of low hazard embankment dams have sometimes considered the use of flexible conduits (i.e., HDPE). Cradles and bedding should not be used with 84 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits Figure 60 .\u2014Precast concr ete usi ng beddi ng as support. flexible conduits , since they r equire deflection to develop s trength in the conduit walls, and cradles and bedding would prevent this deflection. If a flexible conduit is constrained by a cr adle, even one that extends up to the s pringline, the conduit could be overstressed beyond its design strength. Consideration for fully encasing the flexible conduit in concrete should be evaluated, and the sides of the concrete should be sloped at 1H:10V or flatter. Also, the use of a filter diaphragm or collar should be considered. 4.2 Structural des ign and cons truction cons iderations A conduit must withstand internal fluid and vacuum pressures, external hydrostatic loadings and buc kling pressure s, embankment loads, surfa ce surcharge loads, construction loads, operational and maintenance loadings, and combinations of these loads. Designers should also consider the effects of horizontal and vertical movements that may occur from s ettlement and s preading of the embankment and foundation. These movements may r esult in loads on the conduit in exces s of loads predicted from normal static computations. Excessive movements, both vertical and lateral, can occur when conduits have f oundations that ar e either weak or compressible, or both. Poorly compacted embankment dams can spread from shear deformations , which als o can lead to lateral s preading of the conduit. Some s hales may be relatively incompressible but have anisotropic shear strength conditions that allow exces sive later al movement without much compr ession. 85 Conduits through Embankment Dams Loading conditions typically analyzed include: Usual .\u2014This loading condition includes normal operating conditions with the reservoir at or near the normal water surface, involving combinations of vertical soil load (due to the weight of the fill column above the conduit); horizontal soil load; ext ernal and int ernal hydr ostatic pressure loads he ver tical founda tion rea ction (genera lly assumed to be equa l to the vertica l soil loa d plus weight of the conduit). Unusual .\u2014This loading condition includes loads associated with a high res ervoir water surface and high discharges due to flood conditions. However, since floods are typically s hort lived, the conduit may not come under increased exter nal hydr ostatic pr essure. The difference in loading conditions between usual and unus ual may be limited to increas ed internal hydros tatic pres sure. Extreme .\u2014This loading condition is associated with us ual loading conditions plus earthquake loading. Depending on the \"criticality\" of the conduit (i.e., consequences due to failure or severe damage of the conduit under seismic loading), a range of earthquakes should be cons idered, including s eismic loading to the ma ximum credible ea rthqua ke (MC E). Conduits a re \"low profile\" structures and tend to have a high f undamental f requency. Unles s the conduit is founded on deep layer s of soil wher e peak gr ound acceler ations could be magnif peak gr ound acceler ations are typically as sumed to act on the conduit. If the f undamental f requency of the conduit is greater than 33 her tz, a pseudostatic approach generally gives reasonable results; otherwise a more detailed seismic analysis may be required (i.e., response spectrum method or time-history method). Additional factors that may affect loading conditions are the type of foundation, method of bedding, flexibility of the conduit, and s oil characteristics (internal angle of friction, unit weight, homogeneity, consolidation properties, cohesiveness, and moisture content). Constructio n.\u2014This loading condition pertains to loads resulting from construction activities . These activities may include cons truction vehicles or equipment moving or working adjacent to or on the conduit and ar e cons idered short term loa dings. In soils, a var iety of factors should be cons idered when des igning a conduit, including angle of internal friction, density, homogeneity and water content of the soil. Various combinations of conditions and loadings will need to be evaluated by the des igner to ens ure a long s ervice lif e for the conduit. The Marston theory of embankment pressures has typically been adopted for calculating loads on a conduit that is partially or fully projecting above the original ground surface. Using the Marston theory, vertical load on the conduit is considered 86 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits to be a combination of the weight of the fill directly above the conduit and the frictional forces , acting either upward or downward, from the adjacent fill. This loading is also known as the \"projection\" condition. When the adjacent fill s ettles more than the overlying fill, downward frictional forces are induced, which can increase the r esultant load on the conduit by as much as 50 per cent of the weight of the fill above the conduit (figure 61). Convers ely, a greater s ettlement immediately above the conduit results in an arching condition, which reduces the load on the conduit by as much as 50 percent of the weight of the fill above the conduit (figure 62). This loading is also known as the \"trench\" condition. This condition may occur for conduits placed in a tr ench. Some publications indicate that higher increas es in load may be applicable (by as much as 200% over the pris m load bas ed on the Ma rston theory); see NR CS's The Structural Design of Underground Conduits (1958, p. 1- 7). The practice of cons tructing conduits within tr enches with ver tical side walls in embankment dams is not recommended. Loss of positive contact of the fill next to the conduit is possible due to the effects of arching. For guidance on the selection of proper excavation for s ide slopes, see section 5.1. The designer should use caution in designing conduits through embankment dams when the over burden is greater than about 100 f eet. This is especially tr ue for conduits that are not founded upon firm rock foundations and not constructed of reinforced cas t-in-place concrete. For large embankment dams , the fill height for which a conduit can be economically designed is limited. Conduits designed for embankment dams with fill heights greater than 100 feet s hould only be attempted by very experienced des igners . Greater fill heights result in extremely high s tresses, exces sive conduit wall thicknes ses, and/or reinforcement r equirements . For high f ill applications, designers may want to consider a tunnel rather than a conduit. The Marston theory is typically considered as a very conservative approach to quantifying loads upon a conduit for a fully projecting condition (R eclamation, 2001a, p. 8) . More detailed t ools are available t hat allow f or two- and three-dimensional and time-dependent analysis. This type of analysis involves the use of s oil interaction models . Soil interaction models can accommodate large displacements, strains, and nonlinear material behavior. Programs, such as Fast Lagrangian Analys is of Continua (FLAC) and Plaxis are ideally s uited for modeling the stages of construction for the conduit, namely excavation, construction of the conduit, and then construction of the embankment over the conduit. Modeling and analyzing the s tages of cons truction enables the pr ogram to accur ately calculate stresses within the conduit af ter the embankment has been placed. These stresses are then us ed in the des ign of the conduit. Sensitivity s tudies should always be run to account for possible variations in material properties, foundation settlements, and construction conditions. The designer may find it prudent to compare conduit loadings developed us ing soil interaction models with the res ults obtained us ing classic loadings from references, such as Design of Small Dams (Reclamation, 1987a) and Culverts, Conduits, and Pipes (USACE, 1998a). 87 Conduits through Embankment Dams Top of embankm ent Figure 61 .\u2014Condui t constr ucted pr ior to ea rthfill pla cement.

Plastic and metal pipes used in the construction of conduits are considered to be flexible. A flexible pipe is generally considered to be able to deflect without structural distress to the pipe or to any coating or lining. A flexible pipe derives its external load capacity from its flexibility. Under load, the pipe tends to deflect, developing s oil support at the sides of the pipe. Flexible pipe used in conduit construction within significant and high hazard embankment dams should be encased in cast-in-place reinforced concrete to provide shapes that allow for good compaction of embankment materials against the conduit. Flexible pipe used in conduit construction within low hazard embankment dams is often not encased in cast-in-place reinforced concrete. As discussed in s ection 2.1, concr ete used for conduits is typically either reinforced cast-in-place or precast concr ete. Specif ic guidance per taining to thes e mater ials is discussed in the f ollowing s ections concr ete for conduits is typically des igned by either the working stress de sign (WSD) or stre ngth de sign (SD) me thods or the alternate design method, which is similar to WSD, but includes some SD features . The WSD method proportions reinforced cast-in-place concrete members for prescribed service loads at stresses well below the ultimate and assume s linear distribution of flexural stresses and stra ins. The SD method re quires service loads to be increased by specified load f actors and computed nominal s trengths to be r educed by s pecified phi factors. Various editions of the American Concrete Institute building code (ACI 318) describe these design methods. Reinforced cast-in-place concrete conduits are normally subject to different loadings, more s evere expos ure conditions , and more res trictive s erviceability requirements than buildings . The major embankment des ign agencies and ACI have mor e restrictive versions of WSD and SD methods that are appropriate for reinforced cast-in-place concrete conduit design. A brief summary of the reinforced cast-in\u00ad place concrete design philosophies used for conduits by these agencies includes: Reclamatio n.\u2014Some existing conduits in R eclamation's inventory of embankment dams are as much as 100 year s old. Reclamation des igned thes e conduits with the WSD method. Reclamation has also used the WSD method for modif ying any exis ting s tructures that wer e originally des igned us ing WSD. The WSD method is preferred for any f eature cons idered to be an integr al par t of a hydraulic s tructure, s uch as a spillway or outlet works , where crack control limitations are important considerations. 89 Conduits through Embankment Dams For high- flow-velocity, high- flow-volume s tructures, cracking can caus e significant hydraulically induced s tructural problems , such as cavitation, uplift, and binding of gates or valves . This is cons idered es pecially impor tant wher e a conduit passes through or under an embankment dam and seepage could be detrimental to the s afety of the dam or wher e shutting down a s tructure for maintenance or repair can be difficult or very costly. Embankment dams and appur tenant s tructures are usually des igned f or larger load f actors than thos e used for buildings . Allowable s tresses of 1,800 lb/in2 (compressive strength for concrete) and 24,000 lb/in2 (minimum s pecified tens ile stress for Grade 60 reinforcement) ar e used in WSD. With the issua nce of AC I 318-02 (2002), the a lterna te design method wa s removed f rom the code. However , ACI 318- 02 Commentar y Section R1.1 states, \"the Alter nate Des ign M ethod of the 1999 code may be us ed in place of applicable sections of the 2002 code.\" In order to fully address the require ments for hy draulic struc tures for its da ms, R eclamation is c urrently developing guidance f or the des ign of reinforced cas t-in-place concr ete structures with unique des ign requirements . This guidance will include recommended codes, design aids, and references for use in design. This guidance will allow us e of the s trength des ign method for s tructures where crack control and/or deflection limitations have been adequately addressed. Designers may want to cons ider this guidance when it becomes available, f or use in future design work. USACE .\u2014The USACE us es the SD method in accordance with ACI 318, as modified in USACE's Strength Design for Reinforced Concrete Hydraulic Structures (1992, pp. 1-2 and 1-3). Load factors that bear a clos e resemblance to ACI 318 are modified by a hydraulic factor to account for the s erviceability needs (crack control) of hydraulic structures. This modification factor is intended to ensure that the r esulting des ign was as cons ervative as if the wor king stress design wer e used. NRCS.\u2014The NRCS us es either the WSD or SD methods for site cas t \"service hydraulic structures,\" which includes conduits through embankment dams. The cur rent NRCS WSD cr iteria follow ACI 318- 77 (1977) with s everal exceptions , including (1) allowable concr ete compr essive stress limited to 0.40 f'c and (2) allowable s teel tens ile stress limited to 20,000 lb/in2. The cur rent NRCS SD cr iteria als o follow ACI 318- 77 with s everal exceptions , including (1) s ingle load factor of 1.8 applied to all loads and (2) s teel des ign yield strength limited to 40,000 lb/in2 for all gr ades. Current NRCS WSD and SD cr iteria are styled to pr oduce bas ically the s ame concr ete des ign results. Both are intended to pr ovide lower stress levels than the ACI Code f or 90 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits buildings to ens ure long term durability in aggres sive wet/dry, freeze/thaw envir onments . The NRCS is developing updated concrete design guidance under contract to a consultant. This guidance will adopt current ACI codes and explain their application to different NRCS concrete s tructures . The guidance will als o include concrete joint design details and numerous example problems. The expected publication date is 2006. The designer should consider adoption of ACI 350 Code R equirements for Environmental Engineering Concrete Structures . ACI 350-01 (2001) s tates: \"The code portion of this document covers the structural design, materials selection, and construction of envir onmental engineer ing concr ete structures. Such s tructures are used for conveying, storing, or treating liquid, wastewater, or other materials, such as solid was te. They include ancillary s tructures for dams , spillways , and channels .\" These structures are subject to uniquely dif ferent loadings , mor e severe expos ure conditions and more res trictive s erviceability requirements than normal building structures . ACI 350-01 further s tates: The li quid-tightness o f a structure wi ll be rea sonably assured i f: a) The concr ete mixture is well proportioned, w ell cons olidated without segrega tion, and properly cured. b) Crack widths a nd depths a re minimized. c) Joints are properly spa ced, si zed, desi gned, wa terstopped, a nd constructed. d) Adequate rei nforcing steel i s provi ded, properly deta iled, fa bricated, a nd placed. Impervi ous protecti ve coa tings or ba rriers where requi red. Reinf orced cas t-in-place concr ete conduits are usually tr ansversely des igned as rigid structures, whereby higher vertical loads relative to horizontal loads are supported by the transverse bending and shear strength of the conduit. Various loading conditions that maximize potential vertical loads while minimizing potential horizontal loads and vice ver sa are nor mally inves tigated to cons ervatively deter mine the r equired transverse bending strength of the conduit. Uplift pressures should be assumed to act uniformly a cross the entire width of the conduit. Interna l hydrosta tic pressures must also be cons idered in the des ign. References, such as Reclamation's Design of Small Dams (1987a ) and USAC E's Conduits, Culverts, and Pipes (1998a) provide further details on the structural design of concrete conduits. Reinforced cast-in-place concrete conduits may also need to be longitudinally designed for tension stresses due to the friction of the spreading embankment along 91 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 63 .\u2014Longitudinal reinforcement across a condui t joint experienced tensi le failure caused by la teral spreading of the embankment da m. the conduit and for bending stresses due to nonuniform foundation conditions along the length of the conduit section. Figure 63 shows an example of longitudinal reinforcement that exper ienced tens ile failure caus ed by later al spreading of the embankment dam. Reclamation's experience has shown that cracking in reinforced cast-in-place conduits due to shrinkage and temperature can be minimized by placing conduits in 12- to 16- foot s ections (figure 64). The inter faces between conduit s ections are typically control joints . Control joints are us ed to provide for control of initial shrinkage stresses. Waterstops should be used across all control joints, and a bond breaker, such as curing compound, should be applied to control the joint surfaces to direct cr acking towar d the joints . The longitudinal r einforcement is continuous across the contr ol joint to limit movement between adjoining ends of conduit sections. The conduit sections should be constructed in an alternating pattern, such that any concrete volume shrinkage occurs prior to adjoining conduit sections being placed.

In larger conduits, horizontal construction joints typically located at s pringline have been us ed to facilitate concrete placement. Horizontal construction joints are also useful in preventing flotation of steel liners during concrete placement. For guidance on the use of control and construction joints and waterstops, see section 4.3. For guidance on construction practices for the placement of concr ete, see Reclamation's Design of Small Dams (1987a, p. 659), and the USAC E's Standard Practice for Concrete for Civil Works Structures (2001b). 4.2.1.2 are des igned as rigid structural elements in the same fashion as reinforced cast-in-place concrete conduits. Internal and exter nal loads are computed, and var ious load combinations are cons idered as acting on a unit length of pipe. Thrusts and moments at various points around the perimeter of the pipe are calculated. Required reinforced concrete proportions, including concrete thicknes s, reinforcing s teel amount, s teel cylinder thicknes s, and prestress tension, are determined as required for component concrete, reinforcing steel, and pr estressing wir e strengths , respectively. Reinf orced concr ete des ign pr ocedur es and extens ive examples specifically f or RCP and RCCP are contained in AWWA M9, (1995). AWWA C304, The des igner should us e thes e procedur es carefully since they ar e bas ically tar geted towar d pipelines wher e inter nal pressures are high, but exter nal loads are low r elative to most embankment dams. Also, for prestressed pipes, the procedures assume that pipelines are usually f ull of water over their service lif e. Some embankment dams , particularly common NR CS flood control dams, are seldom full of water, and lesser relative humidity may allow concr ete shrinkage and los s of prestress. The reader is directed to the Introduction for examples of how design standards have been misused. 93 Conduits through Embankment Dams The reinforced concrete design of some types and sizes of precast concrete pipes has been s tandar dized by manuf acturers. AST M C 361 contains tables of reinforced concrete design proportions for various sizes and classes of pipe. Sizes range from 12 to 108 inches in ins ide diameter . Classes range f rom A- 25 to D- 125 wher e A, B , C, D repres ent fill heights over the pipe of 5, 10, 15, 20 feet res pectively, and 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 re present inte rnal water pressure in pounds pe r squa re inch. The designer should us e thes e standar dized des igns cautious ly since the s tandar d assumes a simple s oil pris m load ins tead of a pos itive projecting condition typical of mos t embankment dams. Unique designs can be accommodated in the Standard Specif ication f or higher exter nal loads . An alter native to a theor etical r einforced concr ete des ign pr ocedur e is the indir ect design procedure based on product testing. Most concrete pipe plants have the equipment to do a three-edge bearing load test on full size pipe specimens. The NRCS r equirements for precast concr ete pipe tes ted in accor dance with AST M C 497 s hall demons trate the following bearing loads : For RCP or RCCP manufactured according to AST M C ), or AW WA loa d required to produce a 0.01-inch crack, 1 foot in length For PCCP manufactured according to AWWA C301 (1999b), the load required to produce a 0.001-inch crack, 1 foot in length, or the load 10 percent greater than the s pecified thr ee-edge bear ing strength, whichever occur s first The NR CS has commonly used PCCP in most of their high and significant hazard and lar ger low hazar d embankment dams over the pas t 50 year s. NRCS wor ked with the American Concrete Pressure Pipe Association to develop design curves as a basis for proof of strength of AWWA C301 (1999b) PCCP. The curves, based on test data, s how cons ervative r elations hips between the r esultant concr ete cor e stress and the three-edge bearing strength for v arious pi pe sizes. Resultant concrete core stress can be calculated f rom the concr ete thicknes s, cylinder thicknes s, prestress wire amount, and wire wrapping stress. NRCS's Certifica tion of Prestressed Concrete C ylinder Pipe, (1982) contains these des ign cur ves and pr ocedur e. The NR CS uses two construction specifications for concrete pipe, Construction Specification 41 (2001a) and Cons truction Specification 42 (2001b). Cons truction Specif ication 41 des the mater ials and acceptable cons truction pr ocedur es for reinforced concrete pressure pipe conduits. This specification is commonly used for contracts involving principal s pillway conduits on embankment projects designed by NRCS. Construction Specifica tion 41 refers to Ma terial Specifica tion 541 (2001c) which describes the minimum ma terial require ments for re inforc ed concrete pressure pipe. 94 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits Construction Specification 42 is for other types of conduits, including nonreinforced conduits, such as culverts and drainage pipe. Specification 42 refers to several different material specifications, depending on the specific application being construc ted. Material Specification 541 is re ferenced for re inforc ed concrete pressure pipe, Material Specification 542 (2001d) is for concrete culvert pipe, and Material Specification 543 (2001e) is for nonreinforced concrete pipe. A few of the early embankment dams constructed by NR CS used nonreinforced conduits, but the majority of the embankment dams constructed by NR CS have used reinforced conduits. The NRCS process for designing PCCP in embankment dams uses NRCS TR5, The Structural Design of Underground Conduits , (1958) to determine required three-edge bearing strength for a conduit considering embankment, foundation, and cradle or bedding conditions. Such three-edge bearing strength is specified on the construction plans. Pipe supplied to the construction site is either tested as described previously, or documentation is submitted indicating pipe component parameter s, which can be checked agains t the NRCS Specif ication Note No. 5 design cur ves to ens ure adequate thr ee-edge bear ing strength. As with r einforced cas t-in-place concr ete, individual pr ecast pipe s ections may als o need to be longitudinally des igned for tens ile stresses due to s preading of the embankment dam along the conduit. For PCCP, the strength of the steel cylinder resists the se tensile stresses. Sample calculations c an be found i n NRCS's Use of AWWA C302 Pipe fo r Principal Spillway Co nduit (1970). Figures 66 throug h 69 show the diffe rent arrangements of re inforc ing steel and/or prestressing wire used in the various types of precast concrete pipe. 4.2.2 Plastic Currently, the primary source of design information for plastic pipe is from manuf acturers. However , mos t of this information is targeted to s ewer and water distribution pipes and does not address the unique factors involved in using plastic pipe within embankment dams. FEMA is sponsoring the development of a supplemental \"best practices\" guidance document pertaining solely to plastic pipe used in embankment dams . This document will contain detailed procedures and guidelines for design, inspection, maintenance, and repair of plastic pipe. The guidance document will be bas ed on experience provided from experts in the fields of civil and geotechnical engineer ing and cons truction. The expected publication date is 2006. This document will be made widely available for us e by the dam s afety community. Interim guidance can be f ound in NRCS's Structural Design of Flexible Conduits (2005). This reference pr ovides design guidance f or flexible pipe mater ials, including metal and plas tic. 95 Conduits through Embankment Dams Mastic in joint Steel reinforcing cages Steel skirt Concrete core Steel spigot ring Steel bell ring Steel skirt Mastic in joint Rubber gasket Steel reinforcing cages Rubber gasket Figure 66 .\u2014Rei nforced concrete pi pe (RCP) illustr ates pi pe with steel joi nt rings, the bottom figure illustr ates a concr ete joi nt.

Therm oset plastic.\u2014See s ection 12.2. Plastic pipe used within low hazard embankment dams is often not encased in reinforced cas t-in-place concr ete. Use of plastic pipe in new, low hazar d embankment dams is generally limited to s mall diameters (less than 12 inches ). However , use of a filter diaphr agm or collar is a valuable def ensive des ign meas ure, even for low hazard classification embankment dams with favorable site conditions. Some designs may not employ a filter diaphragm around the conduit, but eliminating this valuable and relatively inexpens ive feature s hould be carefully cons idered and 97 Conduits through Embankment Dams justified based on extremely favorable soil conditions, good conduit construction materials and methods, reliable construction practices, and favorable foundation conditions. 4.2.3 Metal As discussed in the previous section, NRCS's Structural Design of Flexible Conduits , (2005) provides design guidance for flexible pipe materials , including metal and plastic. In general, the following guidance should be considered for conduits using metal pipe: Steel pipe.\u2014Steel pipe s hould be des igned in accor dance with indus try accepted methods , such as found in AWWA M11 (2004), Ams tutz (1970), and Jacobs en (1974). For guidance on the des ign of steel pipe us ed within conduits , see section 12.1.2. CMP.\u2014CMP should only be used for nonpressurized applications in low hazard embankment dams. CMP should be designed in accordance with indus try-accepted methods as found in the Amer ican As sociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials' (AASHTO), Standard Specifications for Highway Brid ges (2002) or the Amer ican I ron and Steel I nstitute's (AISI), Handbook of Steel Drainage and Highway Construction Products (1994). USACE's Culverts, Conduits , and Pipe s (1998a) pr ovides guidance f or CMP used in r ural levee s ystems and dr ainage culver ts. Certain as pects in that r eference may apply to CMP used in low hazard embankment dams. Metal pipe used within low hazard embankment dams is often not encased in reinforced cas t-in-place concr ete. However , as discussed previous ly with plas tic pipe, the us e of a filter diaphragm or collar is a valuable defens ive des ign meas ure, even for low hazard classification embankment dams with favorable site conditions. 4.3 Watertightness The major dam- building agencies require conduits within an embankment dams to have wa tertight joints. The degree of wa ter tightness depends on the a nticipa ted hydrostatic head either inside or outside of the conduit. For example, pressurized reinforced cast-in-place concrete conduits are waterstopped and have longitudinal reinforcement extending acr oss the joint. In some cas es, a welded s teel liner may be used for additional protection. The following sections discuss guidance pertaining to the watertightness of concrete conduits. Plastic and metal pipe are frequently used in the renovation of existing conduits; for guidance on watertightness using these mater ials, see chapter 12. 98 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits If the joints between the ends of conduit s ections separate or develop other defects, the conduit may develop leaks . This leakage can lead to the development of inter nal erosion or backward erosion piping failure mechanisms. The designer should carefully consider the important parameters related to watertightness, such as: Conduit joints Barriers within joints Guidance per taining to thes e par ameter s is discussed in the f ollowing s ections . 4.3.1 Conduit joint Conduit designers should be aware that foundation conditions are usually not homogenous along the alignment of the conduit. Variable foundation conditions can result in abrupt changes in the foundation settlement of a conduit beneath an embankment dam, causing large relative movements and failure of the conduit. A properly des igned joint will limit vertical and trans verse displacement of conduit sections relative to each other as the embankment dam settles. A properly designed joint will als o accommodate rotation and longitudinal movement while retaining watertightness in the conduit. Figure 70 shows a joint within an outlet works conduit tha t has settled differentia lly and is a llowing seepa ge to enter through the joint. Designers must estimate the maximum joint elongation that may occur from the compres sibility of the foundation as accurately as possible. The predicted joint elongation depends on the shear strength of the foundation, the estimated settlement of the foundation, the configuration of the embankment dam, and the lengths of conduit joints used in the design. If the predicted elonga tion is grea ter tha n the designed joints can accommodate, changes to the des ign ar e neces sary. Design changes may involve using shorter lengths of conduit, removing compressible foundation s oils and replacing them with compacted backfill, and flattening the slopes of the embankment dam. Embankment dam settlement may not always be uniform, as predicted by analyses, and is often be erratic and can res ult in abrupt joint dis placements in certain situations . Abrupt joint dis placements may be the res ult of localized joint movement, and s ettlement can be mor e extens ive than pr edicted by theor etical analys is. Figure 71 illus trates how actual s ettlement can differ from theoretical settlement. Abrupt joint dis placements may be mor e likely f or conduits that ar e constructed using precast concrete pipe than for conduits constructed with reinforced cas t-in-place concr ete. The reason for this difference is that r einforced cast-in-place concr ete conduits are cons tructed with longitudinal r einforcement extending through the joint (control joint), which a llows the conduits to bridge over a weak f oundation and s pread the load mor e uniformly over more of the conduit foundation. 99 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 70 .\u2014Wa ter seepi ng through a joint in an outlet w orks condui t. The joint has experienced di fferential settlem ent. This joint had no longitudinal reinforcement extending across the joint. The mortar joint filling ha s cracked a nd deteri orated. Based on observations of conduits through 20 selected NR CS dams constructed during the 1960s on compres sible foundations (Cas agrande Volume, 1973, p. 235): 70 percent of the joint opening occurred during construction of the embankment dam. Additional measurement of joint openings several years after construction showed negligible increas es. Conduits cons tructed on compr essible foundations are mor e likely to exper ience joint spreading problems. Special attention should be given to evaluating the compres sibility and s hear strength of thes e soil types . Performing field vane s hear tests and similar evaluations are appropriate to evaluate the undrained strength of these types of foundations. Available references and procedures for predicting the amount of conduit spreading based on foundation consolidation and shear strength parameters are not well known and can be inappropriately used by inexperienced designers. The NRCS's Computatio n of Joint Extensibility Requirements (1969) uses the predicted vertical strain beneath the conduit, the shear strength of foundation soils, and the geometry of the emba nkment a nd founda tion in a n attempt to predict the horizontal strain at the conduit. Additional information on conduit extension can be found in the Casagrande Volume (1973, pp. 209-237). For an example of a project wher e spreading of conduit joints occur red, see the cas e history in appendix B for Little Chippewa Cr eek Dam. 100 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits Figure 71 .\u2014Actual embankment dam settlement can differ from predicted settlement. Excessive lateral movement of the embankment/foundation system can also occur when thin weak layer s in the f oundation ar e loaded beyond their shear strength. These movements may res ult in s lope ins tability problems but can als o damage the conduit if it is located over the offending layer. Slope flattening and berms are commonly us ed des ign meas ures to prevent s uch movements , and this will res ult in a longer conduit than otherwise would be needed. Foundations under conduits should have relatively uniform compres sibility characteris tics to prevent differential settlement and movement of conduit joints. The Hernandez Dam case history in appendix B illustrates problems that can occur when conduits are located partly over compres sible fill and partly over nonyielding bedrock. Special pr ecautions should be taken f or joints wher e the conduit connects to a structure, such as an intake s tructure (figure 72). This location may be in an ar ea susceptible to differentia l settlement due to the differing weights of the two structures and the foundation beneath them. An engineered fill to limit s ettlement may be needed under the intake structure, when the structure and conduit cannot be located on bedrock or a firm foundation. If the intake structure is constructed on a pile f oundation, s pecial pr ecautions are also required for the f irst few joints of the conduit because high stresses can develop as a result of bending stresses caused by differentia l settlement. Extending the conduit a nd loca ting the inta ke structure beyond the limits affected by the embankment dam can r educe thes e stresses. Special precautions are also required, if the conduit operates under pressure or high velocities , has discharges that cr eate a s urging ef fect, or if the conduit is cons tructed on a compr essible foundation. This may include the us e of welded s teel pipe to serve as a liner within the conduit. The steel pipe liner provides ductility and a water tight s eal. 101 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 72 .\u2014Special design considerations are required in locations where differential settlem ent betw een tw o structures ca n occur . Chapter 2 discussed ma terials used for the construction of conduits, such a s reinforced cas t-in-place concr ete, pr ecast concr ete, plas tic, and metal. The following sections provide guidance pertaining to joints used with these types of materials. 4.3.1.1 Reinforced cas t-in-place concrete Reinforced cast-in-place concrete conduits undergo physical changes in length, width, height, s hape, and volume when s ubjected to envir onmental and mechanical conditions surrounding them (USACE, 1995e, p. 2- 1). These changes may be the result of drying s hrinkage, cr eep, s ettlement, and other effects. As these changes occur, inte rnal stresses may form w ithin the concrete, resulting in cracking. Most reinforced cast-in-place concrete conduits require joints to control or limit cracking and ar e typically placed in conduits about 12 to 16 f eet apar t. The location of joints can als o be utilized to facilitate cons truction. Four types of joints are commonly used in construction of reinforced cast-in-place concrete (R eclamation, 1987a, p. 799): Contractio n joints.\u2014Contraction joints are used in concrete to provide for the volumetr ic shrinkage of a monolithic unit or movement between monolithic units. These joints provide for a complete separation of the monolithic unit into s maller structural elements . No bond is expected between the concr ete surfaces of the s maller structural elements . Sealing (cur ing) compound applied to the joint surfaces can be used to prevent bonding. Except as otherwise 102 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits provided by dowels, reinforcement is never continuous across a contraction joint. A minimum of 7 days should elaps e between adjacent placements at contraction joints. Waterstops should be placed across contraction joints. However , exces sive movement at the joint may damage the water stop. Therefore, contraction joints are not typically used in the construction of conduits , since they may not ens ure a water tight joint. Contr action joints are often us ed in the cons truction of entrance and ter minal s tructures. Control joints.\u2014Control joints are typically us ed in reinforced cas t-in-place concrete conduit to provide for control of initial shrinkage stresses and cracks of monolithic units. Control joints are constructed as described for contraction joints , except that r einforcement is always continuous across the joint. The reinforcement pr events the longitudinal f orces from opening the joints . Waterstops should be placed across control joints to provide a watertight seal. The surface of concr ete first placed at joints should be coated with s ealing compound, s o no bond develops between the ends of adjoining conduit sections . Figure 73 illus trates a typical control joint us ed in conduit construction. These joints are ver y effective in minimizing dif ferential movement between conduit s ections . A minimum of 7 days should elaps e between adjacent placements at ver tical contr ol joints and 3 days between adjacent placements at hor izontal joints . Expans ion joints.\u2014Expansion joints are used in concrete to prevent damage due to the compressional forces from movement caused by the expansion of abutting concrete. Expansion joints separate adjoining structural elements. Dowels and keyways can be us ed acr oss these joints to resist movement. Preformed joint filler is placed in all expans ion joints . The joint filler s hould cover the entir e surface of the concr ete at each joint and be laid agains t the concrete and held rigidly in place while concrete is placed on the other side of each joint. All joints in the filler s hould be tightly fitting butt joints . Expans ion joints are not typically used in the construction of conduits, since they do not provide for a watertight joint. However, expansion joints are often used in the construction of entrance and ter minal s tructures. Construction joints .\u2014Cons truction joints are typically us ed in reinforced cas t-in\u00ad place concrete conduit to facilitate cons truction; to reduce initial s hrinkage stresses and cracks; to allow time for installation of embedded metalwork; or to allow for subsequent placing of other concrete. For conduit construction, bond is required at thes e joints , and reinforcement is continuous acros s the joint. The surface of the joint s hould be cleaned to expos e aggr egate bef ore placement of the next concrete lift. A minimum of 7 days should elapse between adjacent placements at ver tical joints and a minimum of 3 days between adjacent placements at hor izontal cons truction joints . As much as 103 Conduits through Embankment Dams Waterstop Contr ol joint Figure 73 .\u2014Typical control joint used in reinforced cast-in-place concrete conduit construction. Longitudinal reinforcement is continuous through the joint. possible, vertical construction joints should be avoided because of concerns with getting a good bond on a vertical joint surface. The joints previously described are planned joints that allow for good procedures to treat the joint. Sometimes during construction, interruptions occur during the placement of concrete and require an unplanned joint. This type of joint is referred to as a \"cold joint.\" Great care should be exercised to avoid cold joints because this type of joint introduces the possibility for higher porosity, weakened shear and tensile strength, and decreased durability. Typical cold joint treatments include high pressure washing or wet sandblasting to remove mortar coatings, or other contaminants, followed by a high volume, low pressure washing and vacuuming to remove all excess water and debris. If the surface of the cold joint is not properly cleaned, this will result in a lack of bond between the existing surface and new concrete. After cleaning, the surface should be maintained in a damp condition before placing the new concrete. Time delays are specified between placement of adjacent sections at joints to allow the concrete to dissipate heat resulting from the peak hydration temperature. The longer the concrete is given to cool, the smaller the stresses at control and construction joints and the openings at contraction joints due to the volumetric change in the adjacent sections. The length of the time delay can be affected by the concrete mix, the thickness of the sections, the placement temperature of the concrete, and the ambient temperature surrounding the concrete as it cures. Temperature-measuring instruments can be used as an aid in minimizing the curing time between adjacent concrete placements while also minimizing the joint separation between the same placements. These instruments can also be used in 104 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits estimating the in-place strength of concrete, based on its temperature history. Without these temperature instruments, specification paragraphs must be written with conservative requirements for how long a contractor must wait before closure sections can be placed. With temper ature instruments , meas urements can be taken so that it can be determined when the concrete temperature has dropped sufficiently to allow the clos ure placement to be made. This can r esult in making placements several days earlier. If there are a number of placements required, then the total time savings could be a couple of weeks . For certain pr ojects , this could be a cr itical ther mometer , thermocouple, and ther mistor are types of instruments that will meas ure temperature in concrete (USACE, 1987, p. 7-1). Temperature changes are the pr imary caus es of volume change and s tress. The temper ature rise within the concr ete caus es an outwar d expans ion dur ing the ear ly life of the concr ete. The temper ature of the inter nal mas s is higher than that of the expos ed surfa ces. Thus, as the oute r surfa ce cools and tends to shri nk, compre ssive stresses develop internally, and tens ile stresses externally. In order to determine the effect of temper ature on the s tress and volume change, temper atures can be meas ured at a number of points within the s tructure. Thermocouples are suitable f or meas uring temper ature under certain conditions and at s everal locations . However , resistance thermometer s are preferred over thermocouples becaus e they have been f ound to be more dependable, mor e precise, and les s complicated in their oper ation. Sufficient details should be shown on the contract drawings and adequate specifications provided to obtain required installation. The instruments must be properly placed and secured during installation. Care should be exercised during concrete placement becaus e lead wir es can be eas ily damaged. Identification tags should be attached to the cable to accur ately identif y the ins trument (f igure 74). Newer models of temper ature-meas uring ins truments allow f or wireless meter s. A handheld computer permits the data to be compiled and analyzed to provide a real- time concrete strength va lue. The advantages of using temper ature instruments include: They allow for improved timing of construction activities, resulting in shorter durations between placements . Temper atures in specific critical locations within the conduit can be meas ured. More accurate representation of concrete strength is possible. Strength measurements can be obtained any time. 105 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 74 .\u2014An identifying tag used w ith a thermocoupler . For additional guidance on temper ature-meas uring ins truments , see USACE's Instrumentation (1987). 4.3.1.2 Precast concr ete All precast concrete pipes incorporate joints that enable the individual sections to be manuf actured els ewher e and as sembled ons ite to f orm a continuous , water tight conduit. All precast joints are tapered bell and spigot type, which can compress a rubber O-ring gasket as adjacent pipe sections are drawn together. PCCP and R CCP are always fabricated with s teel bells and s pigots, which ar e welded dir ectly to the steel cylinder . See f igures 67, 68, and 69. RCP may be f abricated with either steel or plain concrete joint s urfaces . See figure 66. Steel bell and s pigot joints are always specified for larger dams wher e a high conf idence of water tightnes s is required. Concr ete bell and s pigot joints are acceptable f or only low hazar d dams . There is no difference in the s teel ring between All thr ee types of pipe ar e allowed in NRCS embankment dams. Preference is based solely on economics, which consider the externa l and interna l strength required a s well a s the weight of the pipe to transport and ins tall. The critical consideration for precast pipe joints is the degree of longitudinal rotation and longitudinal elongation that the joint can accommodate without overstressing the ends of the pipe or losing watertightness. For C302 (R CP), CP), the movement ca pacity of the pipe is specified by joint length and joint limiting angle. Joint length is defined as the maximum dis tance through which the s pigot can move, r elative to the bell or sleeve, f rom the f ully 106 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits engaged to the f ully extended condition of the joint when the adjoining pipe s ections are in parallel, concentric alignment while maintaining full confinement of the gas ket. The joint limiting angle of the joint is defined as the maximum deflection angle between adjoining pipe s ections that the joint will per mit bef ore the outer surface of the spigot comes into dir ect contact with ins ide of the mating bell or sleeve. Part of the elongation and r otational capacity of the joint to accommodate expected settlement a nd movement a long the conduit is lost due to insta llation tolera nces a nd designed conduit camber . Standar d and deep joints are usually available f rom mos t manufacturers. Where joint capacity is inadequate, shorter lengths of pipe can be used to decrease the movement of each individual joint. Figures 66, 67, 68, and 69 illustrate the joint details of AWWA C300, C301, and C302, as RCCP, PCCP, and RCP respectively. 4.3.1.3 Plastic Methods used to join plastic pipe are discussed in section 12.1.1. 4.3.1.4 Metal Methods used to join metal pipe are discussed in section 12.1.2. 4.3.2 Barrier within joints Chapter 2 discussed ma terials used for the construction of conduits, such a s reinforced cas t-in-place concr ete, pr ecast concr ete, plas tic, and metal. The following sections provide guidance per taining to the bar rier within joints used with thes e types of materials. 4.3.2.1 Reinforced cas t-in-place concrete Waterstops a re used to prevent the movement of wa ter through joints of reinforced cast-in-place concrete conduits . Figure 75 illus trates how a waters top is typically placed acr oss the joint of a reinforced cas t-in-place conduit. Water stops are available in a var iety of mater ials and s hapes. The mos t common water stops used in conduit construction are typically made of preformed flexible materials, the basic resin of which is virgin PVC. The water stop is fabricated, s uch that the cr oss section is dense, homogeneous, and free from porosity and other imperfections. The waters top is specially s haped, s o it will interlock with the concrete. Figure 76 s hows a waterstop with ribbed sides and a centerbulb profile. This type of waterstop (also referred to a s dumbbe ll sha ped) is ve ry versatile, and the centerbulb c an accommodate later al, transverse, and s hear movements . Larger center bulb diameter s are available to accommodate lar ger anticipated movements . 107 Conduits through Embankment Dams Transv erse reinforcement (outside face of conduit) Longitudinal reinforcement extending across (outside face of conduit) Longitudinal reinforcement extending across (inside face of conduit) Control joint Waterstop Transv erse reinforcement (inside face of conduit) Figure 75 .\u2014Wa terstop is placed across the joi nts of condui ts to stop w ater from coming through the joi nt. Figure 76 .\u2014Typi cal waterstop used i n condui t constr uction to pr event the m ovement of w ater through joints. The ends of thi s waterstop ha ve been spli ced tog ether. The mos t commonly us ed sizes of water stops are either 6- or 9-inch width. The anticipated hydrostatic head within the conduit should be considered in selecting the thickness a nd width of the wa terstop to be used. Usua lly, assuming a waterstop width about thr ee times the s ize of the maximum s ize aggr egate in the concr ete is sufficient. In some applications , the des igner may want to cons ider the us e of double waterstops. Although waterstops are an important seepage control feature, proper installation during construction is often overlooked. Common installation errors include: Poorly secured waterstop .\u2014Poorly secured water stop can r esult in uneven embedment or an undulating alignment. A poorly secured waterstop can move during concr ete placement and may become inef fective in pr eventing the movement of water through the conduit joint. Figure 77 shows an example of a poorly secured waterstop that experienced movement during concrete 108 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits placement. The most secure way to support waterstop during concrete placement is with the use of properly built forms (commonly referred to as split forms). Figure 78 shows an example of a waterstop inserted through a specially cut slot in the form. Additional support is provided to the waterstop on the nonplacement side, to ensure no movement occurs. Proper waterstop installation requires that one-half of the waterstop be embedded on each side of the joint. Nailing, s tapling, or ins ertion of wire through the waters top s hould not be allowed, s ince this may af fect the integr ity of the mater ial and s horten the seepage path around the waterstop. Often contractors use hog ring fasteners crimped along the edge of the water stop and wir ed to r einforcing steel to secure the water stop. If hog r ings are used, extr eme car e should be exer cised not to pier ce the water stop when cr imping, s ince this could r esult in s hortening of the seepage path around the waterstop. Also, reinforcing bars should not be allowed to penetr ate the water stop. Poorly spliced waterstop .\u2014Since the P VC water stop is thermoplas tic, it can be spliced at the cons truction s ite as needed. The ends of water stop to be s pliced should be properly aligned, true, and straight. A miter-box guide and portable saw is typically us ed to cut water stop. The proper splicing of water stop requires the us e of an electr ic ther mostatically contr olled water stop s plicing iron. Sometimes contractors will us e a welding torch in an attempt to s plice the waters top together (Zomok, 2004, p. 3). A torch will caus e PVC to burn, resulting in a poorly spliced waterstop joint. The joints should not be lapped. Approved manufacturer recommendations should be followed for splicing. Poorly consolidated concrete.\u2014During concrete placement, the concrete surrounding the wa terstop should be a dequately vibra ted, such tha t the wa terstop is completely embedded in concrete. Inspectors should pay close attention during construction for proper waterstop installation. Any improperly installed or spliced waterstop should be removed and replaced. The contractor's proposed method of water stop ins tallation s hould be car efully reviewed pr ior to beginning any work. Approved manufacturers' installation recommendations should be carefully followed. The use of water stops across contr ol joints is advis ed even f or steel lined conduits . Guidance on the des ign of water stops is available in the USACE's Waterstops and Other Preform ed Joint Ma terials ivil W orks Structures (1995e). The Arka butla case history in appendix B illustrates the importance of us ing waters tops in the construction of conduits. 4.3.2.2 Precast concrete For all precast concrete pipe, a rubber gasket (figures 66-69) provides the primary barrier against movement of water or soil into or out of the conduit. The spigot end 109 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 77 .\u2014A poorly secured wa terstop m oved duri ng concrete pla cement. Figure 78 .\u2014Wa terstop held fi rmly in place by use of a speci ally cut slot i n the for m. of the joint is fabricated to contain a rectangular recess that holds a continuous solid rubber ring of circular cross section. The rubber gasket is compr essed when the spigot is pushed into the bell end of the joint. Figure 79 shows an example of a rubber gasket being installed on a precast pipe. The gasket and steel rings, if used, are manuf actured to high toler ances to ens ure a reliable high pr essure seal. Lubricating the gas ket and ins ide face of the bell with vegetable s oap can eas e assembly. In embankment dams, a mastic sealing compound (figures 66-69) and metal or geotextile bands are typically placed around the outside length of the joint to prevent any movement of s oil backfill into the joint s pace that might interfere with future joint movement. 110 Chapter 4\u2014Structural Design of Conduits Figure 79 .\u2014A rubber ga sket i s installed a t the spi got end of the preca st concrete pi pe. Quality ins tallation is critical to ens ure precas t pipe joints are as sembled watertight and will remain watertight after the pipe s ettles and moves . Several careful s teps are require d (NR CS, 2001b): Pipe section shall be set to specified line and grade and temporarily supported on pr ecast blocks or wedges until the s ections are joined and the cr adle is cast. For guidance on us e of cradles , see section 4.1.6. The connecting surface of the bell and spigot shall be thoroughly cleaned and dried. The gas ket and the bell s urface shall be coated with a light coat of soft vegetable soap compound. The spigot s hall be s eated to within 0.5 inches of its final pos ition and the position of the gas ket checked with a f eeler gauge ar ound the entir e circumference of the pipe. Detection of any impr operly seated gas ket will require disassembly. A sealing compound (mas tic) shall be applied to completely fill the exterior annular space between the placed pipe s ections . Figure 80 shows mastic being applied to the annular space of a precast pipe. The sealing compound shall be covered with a metal or geotextile band where stones larger than \u00bc inch may occur in the backfill material. 111 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 80 .\u2014Ma stic being applied to ex terior annula r joint space of preca st concrete pi pe. Water or air pressure testing the completed conduit to appr oximately 10 f eet of hydrostatic head is highly r ecommended bef ore casting the cr adle. An alternative to gas keted joints in PCCP (lined-cylinder, AWWA C301) is welded joints (also known as internal welded tied joints ). Welded joints have been us ed in water pipelines to form a watertight barrier for about 30 years. A continuous interior side fillet weld is required to provide the watertight s eal. Typically, the rubber gas ket is not ins talled in the s pigot gr oove, s ince the gas ket would bur n during the welding operations. Welded joints should only be used for conduit diameters of 36 inches or larger to accommodate acces s by man entry. The des igner will need to carefully evaluate if this alternative provides adequate watertightness for the given conduit application. 112 Chapter 5 Foundation and Embankment Dam Previous chapter s have dis cussed the impor tance of placing the conduit in the mos t favorable location within the embankment dam to reduce problems with foundation and emba nkment settlement. In this cha pter, the rea ctions of soil a nd rock foundation horizons and how they can affect the design of the conduit are discussed. If conduits are located on foundations that are not uniform, differential settlement can lead to cracking and joint problems in the conduit. If foundations consist of low strength or highly compr essible mater ials, unacceptable def ormations and later al movements can damage the conduit. Other discussions in this chapter address how the settlement of embankments near conduits can cr eate hydr aulic f ractur e mechanis ms. Design appr oaches effective in preventing this problem ar e included. The impor tance of careful design of excavations made to ins tall conduits is extens ively dis cussed. Special attention is recommended f or any excavations made tr ansverse to the center line of the embankment where the excavation backfill may be different in compres sibility than the adjacent foundation materials . Recommendations for backfilling s oils near conduits are provided. Problematic s oils, such as broadly gr aded s oils and dis persive clays are def ined, and potential pr oblems associated with them ar e also discussed. 5.1 Excavation and foundation preparation Ideally, sound rock provides the best foundation conditions for conduits. However, ideal conditions are rare, and many embankment dam sites have marginal foundation conditions. If the underlying foundation is highly compressible, subject to collapse upon saturation, or has other objectionable properties, the conduit could be damaged from excessive settlement. In some cases, unsui table founda tion soi ls must be removed and replaced to prevent damage to the conduit. Backfill us ed in excavations for conduits must be compacted uniformly under the conduit. Excavations should be wide enough to accommodate motorized compaction equipment. The side slopes of the excavation must be flat enough to avoid differential settlement of the embankment dam near the conduit. 113 Conduits through Embankment Dams 5.1.1 Rock foundation The foundation line, grade, and density should be uniform. Controlled blasting or other excavation procedures should be followed to avoid damaging the foundation. Smooth blas ting techniques , such as line drilling are typically cons idered. Rocks and/or irregula rities a t the founda tion conta ct that might crea te a stress concentration s hould be removed. Cleaning and backfilling s hould treat exis ting defects , such as soft or pervious soil fillings in the rock, fault gouge, fractures , erosion channels, or solution cavities that cannot be removed. These defects require remova l to a n adequate depth (usua lly three times the width) a nd repla cement with lean concrete s lush grout, dental concrete, or s pecially compacted earthfill. Slush grout s hould only be us ed to fill narrow cracks in the foundation and not large areas . Slush grout typically cons ists of cement and water or, in some cas es, cement, s and, and water. Slush grout can harden and crack under load and for this reason, is used only in s mall areas . Dental or s haping concrete s hould be us ed to fill larger irregularities or discontinuities in the foundation. If the excavated f oundation s urface is subject to s laking when expos ed to the atmos phere, the foundation s urface s hould be protected with s uitable earthfill, a concr ete pad (mud s lab), or an acceptable s ealing compound until conduit construction commences . Protecting the f oundation can r educe the potential f or differential settlement. Shale, chalk, mudstone, and siltstone formations are most prone to slaking problems. If concrete pads are used to protect a foundation, they are usually placed within 24 hours of exposing the foundation to provide protection from weather and construction activities. If the entire foundation cannot be expos ed, the concr ete pad may have to be placed incr ementally. The surface of the concrete pad should be treated as a construction joint, and proper attention given to cleanup to ensure good bond to the conduit. 5.1.2 Soil foundation Conduits located on soil foundations require analysis to predict the amount of foundation s ettlement and s preading that may af fect the conduit. The conduit may need to be cons tructed with a camber to compens ate for the pr edicted s ettlement, and any joints in the conduit mus t be des igned to accommodate the pr edicted spreading. The des igner s hould be aware that foundation compres sibility under embankment dams often is not uniform, and abrupt displacements can occur. Abrupt vertical and horizontal movements can result in overstressing and cracking of conduits and opening of joints. In soil foundations , excavation may be r equired to pr ovide a good inter face between the conduit and foundation and to remove objectionable materials. Foundation materials that have poor s trength and permeability properties will als o require removal. These mater ials may include or ganic mater ial, such as roots and s tumps , 114 Chapter 5\u2014F oundation and Embankment Dam sod, topsoil, wood trash, or other foreign material. Other objectionable materials that may require remova l include very low ssible and collaps ible s oils. If excavation f or the conduit is required in ear th mater ials, the tr ench s hould be wide enough to allow equipment to perform backfill compaction parallel to the conduit. The side slopes of any excavation may need to be flattened to avoid differential settlement. Any excavation f or a conduit mus t cons ider the potential dif ferential settlement that could occur , caus ed by dif ferent pr operties of the compacted backf ill in the excavation and the foundation soils. This problem is most important where foundation soils are soft and compressible or collapsible. Flattening the side slopes of excavations may be required to prevent hydraulic fracture of the overlying embankment. Section 5.2 discusses hydraulic fracture of embankments in more detail. Conduits may be required to be located on a compacted soil base to provide a uniform founda tion. Rather tha n attempting to compa ct the soil founda tion to exactly the required grade, consideration should be given to overbuilding the embankment in the ar ea of the conduit by 1 to 2 f eet and excavating down to the structural grade of the conduit. Depending on the nature of the embankment, it may be desirable to construct a concrete pad directly over the prepared foundation to protect the foundation integrity and minimize degradation when exposed to air, moisture, or construction activity. The concrete pad should be placed within the lateral limits of the conduit. If a wider concrete pad is required on both sides to facilitate cons truction, it s hould be cons tructed with a vertical joint with a bond breaker. The bond breaker will allow for eas y removal of the concrete pad extending beyond the conduit edges. When soft foundation soils are encountered, some designers may propose use of piles to support a conduit. Use of piles is not recommended, because the conduit may become under mined, allowing uncontr olled s eepage to occur under it. This has occurred in at leas t two pile-s upported s pillway conduits in Maryland, where voids up to 5 f eet deep wer e found beneath one s tructure. In the other structure, complete failure of the s pillway conduit occurred les s than 2 years after cons truction was complete. For details concerning the latter s pillway conduit, s ee Bohemia Mill Dam case history in appendix B. 5.2 Cracking and hydraulic fracture of embankment dams Most embankment dams crack, but only a few develop problems from cracking. Transverse cracks that develop in an ups tream and downs tream dir ection ar e of the 115 Conduits through Embankment Dams most concern. Once a crack forms and water enters the crack, three pos sibilities can result (ASDSO, 2003): 1. Water penetrates soil adjacent to the crack and the s oil begins swelling. If the crack is small and not continuous through the embankment dam, it can swell shut and not develop into a problem. 2. Water runs through the cr ack, but the cr ack is small, so the velocities are low, and the soil is resistant to erosion. A wet spot may appear, but no internal erosion takes place. 3. The soil in the embankment dam, s uch as dispersive clay, is erosive. Internal erosion begins, and a concentrated leak develops. More and more internal erosion occur s, and the embankment dam f ails from the br each that is formed. Cracks in embankment dams caused by hydraulic fracture may provide a pathway for internal erosion. If soils in the pathway of the cr ack ar e highly er odible, the cr ack will enlarge quickly, leading to a breaching type of failure. Hydraulic fracture is common near conduits , becaus e the conduits create dif ferential s trains in surrounding embankment soils. Hydraulic fracture of embankment dams can occur when the piezometric head of water within the dam is greater than the lateral effective s tress on the earthfill. Sherard (1986, pp. 905-927) discusses hydraulic fracturing in detail. Figure 81 illustrates how on firs t filling, a wetting front moves through the embankment dam. Figure 82 shows an example of hydraulic fracture in an embankment dam. For an example of a project that exper ienced hydr aulic f ractur e near a conduit, s ee the cas e history for Piketburg Dam in appendix B. Problems often occur on firs t filling of the res ervoir. About 42 percent of all embankment dam failures due to internal erosion or backward erosion piping occur on firs t filling (Fos ter, Fell, and Spannagle, 2000, p. 1025). As discussed in s ection 9.1, filling the embankment dam's reservoir for the firs t time requires caution. Slow filling of the res ervoir is important to allow the wetting front to s lowly penetrate into the embankment dam. This will allow the s oils to swell and deform, which helps prevent hydraulic fracture. Typical filling rates are in the range of 0.5 to 2 feet per day. The designer should consider the rate of reservoir rise when determining the hydraulic capacity of the conduit. For guidance on the hydraulic design of conduits, see chapter 3. Excavations for conduits increase the potential f or differential s ettlement, and special car e is recommended f or any excavations used near and under conduits . The excavation should be wide enough to accommodate motorized compaction 116 Chapter 5\u2014F oundation and Embankment Dam Average wetting front Actual wetting front Figure 81 .\u2014On fi rst filling, a high hydr aulic gradient ex ists in the embankment da m as a wetting front m oves through the da m. The wetting front w ill not be sm ooth. Projecti ons w ill exist due to the di fferent perm eability of the em bankment da m. The wa ter pressure pushi ng against the soi l can easily be g reater than the la teral stress, and hydr aulic fracture can result. Figure courtesy of ASDSO. Figure 82 .\u2014The fa ilure of thi s embankment da m located in South Ca rolina was attributed to hydr aulic fracture. The eroded sea m located to the r ight of the condui t may have been the hydr aulic fracture that formed and allowed i nterna l erosi on and failure of the em bankment da m. The embankment wa s composed of dispersi ve cla ys. 117 Conduits through Embankment Dams equipment, and the side slopes should be flat to reduce differential strain. The USACE (2004a, p. 8-2) recommends : Speci al attenti on must be g iven to the juncti on of em bankments wi th concr ete structures, such a s outlet works . . . to a void piping along the z one . . . . A 10 verti cal on 1 izonta l batter on the concr ete conta ct surfaces will ensur e that the fi ll will be compressed again st the wall as consolidation takes place. . . . It may be desirable to place material at higher water contents to ensur e a more plastic material which can adjust wi thout cracking, but then the effects o f increased po rewater pressures m ust be consi dered. Factors that can contribute to hydraulic fracture in embankment dams include: Differential s ettlement that exceeds about 1 f oot per 100 f eet (meas ured longitudinally along the embankment dam). Settlement that exceeds this limit of acceptable s train can lead to concer n for hydr aulic f ractur e. Trenches that are transverse to the embankment dam create differential settlement, es pecially if the trench backfill has different compres sibility than foundation horizons. Conduits often require excavations to provide a uniform foundation f or the s tructure. Shaping the s ide slopes of an excavation that is transverse to the embankment center line is essential. USACE (2004a, p. 6- 6) recommends : Excavations for outlet condui ts in soil founda tions should be wi de enoug h to allow for backfill com paction pa rallel to the condui t using heavy rolling compaction equi pment. Equipment used to com pact along the condui t should be free of fra ming that prevents i ts load transferri ng wheels or drum from worki ng against the structure. Excavated slopes i n soil for condui ts should be no steeper than 1 vertical to 2 hor izonta l to fa cilitate adequate com paction and bondi ng of backfill with the si des of the ex cavation. The above recommendation suggests that side slopes of excavations should be 2H:1V. This recommendation is appropriate for favorable soil properties. Flatter side slopes should be used for less favorable conditions. Excavation slopes of 3H:1V to 4H:1V are commonly recommended for unfavorable situations. Flatter than normal side slopes for excavations are advisable when the following s ituations exist: 1. When an excavation that is transverse to the center line of an embankment dam is backfilled, the compacted s oils in the excavation may have considerably different stress/strain properties than the foundation horizons that have been excavated. These differences can r esult in 118 Chapter 5\u2014F oundation and Embankment Dam conditions favorable to hydraulic fracture in the overlying embankment. Two examples are: a. Soft foundatio n alluv ial horizons.\u2014Soils compacted into the excavation will be s ignificantly les s compres sible than the s oft soils in the foundation. This will res ult in a s harp difference in s ettlement in the excavation backfill than in the s oft foundation s oils adjacent to it. A variation of this situation is one where the excavation is made in low density, collaps ible foundation s oils that are s ometimes encountered in wes tern United States . These soil types would pr obably have much higher s train potential than the excavation backfill, creating conditions favorable to hydraulic fracture in the overlying embankment. b. Extrem ely dense found ation m aterials.\u2014If an excavation is made in weathered s hale, glacial till, overcons olidated clays , or other materials with very low compres sibility, the s oil used to fill the excavation may be significantly mor e compr essible than the adjacent f oundation mater ials. The result can be dif ferential s ettlement that can cr eate conditions favorable to hydraulic fracture in the overlying embankment. 2. If soils used to cons truct the embankment ar e extr emely s usceptible to internal erosion, excavations transverse to the embankment dam that create conditions favorable to hydraulic fracture should have special attention. Flattening the side slopes of excavations is strongly recommended. Commonly, for problematic conditions, slopes transverse to the center line of the embankment dam ar e made to be 4H:1V or flatter. Examples of soils that are highly susceptible to internal erosion are low plasticity, clayey s ilts, and dis persive clays . Closure sections in embankment dams may also contribute to differential settlement. Closure sections should be avoided, if possible. The Wis ter Dam cas e history (s ee appendix B ) illustrates the dangers inherent with closure sections in embankment dams . Many conduit rehabilitation projects involve making a transverse excavation to the embankment dam and removing the conduit to replace it. The arching ef fect of soils in the clos ure section can r esult in hydr aulic fracturing. Conduits should not be installed in closure sections unless no other alternatives are available. The USACE (2004a, p. 9-3) discusses factors re lated to closure sections as follows : Because closur e secti ons of ea rth dams are usua lly shor t in length and are rapidly brought to g rade, tw o problem s are inherent in their constr uction. First, the 119 Conduits through Embankment Dams developm ent of hi gh ex cess porewa ter pressures i n the founda tion and/or embankment is accentua ted, a nd second, tr ansverse cracks may dev elop a t the junctur e of the closur e secti on with the a djacent a lready constr ucted em bankment a s al settlem ent. . . . Cracking beca use di fferenti al settlem ent may be m inimized by m aking the end slopes of previ ously com pleted em bankment sections no steeper tha n 1 verti cal on 4 hori zontal. The soi l on the end slopes of previ ously com pleted em bankment secti ons should be cut ba ck to well-com pacted material that has not been a ffected by w etting, drying, or frost action. It may be desirable to pla ce core m aterial at higher wa ter contents tha n elsewhere to ensure a more plastic material which can adjust w ithout cr acking, but the closur e secti on design must then co nsider the effects o f increased po rewater pressures wi thin the fi ll. 5.3 Selection and compaction of backfill Proper s election and compaction of backfill material agains t the conduit will minimize the potentia l for differentia l settlement. 5.3.1 Selection of backfill material to be placed agains t conduit If the conduit is being placed in a zoned earthfill embankment dam, backfill for the conduit should usually have properties that are compatible with the adjacent embankment zones . Core zone backfill s hould only be us ed around the conduit through the core s ection, with s hell backfill s oils used outs ide the core. Where the conduit passes through the core of an embankment dam often material with higher plasticity is used near conduits . Plastic mater ials can be placed at a water content wet of optimum (between 1 per cent and 3 per cent wet of optimum) to incr ease plastic behavior . An exception is wher e rock shell zones include lar ge angular rocks that could impose point loads on the conduit. For that condition, encircling the conduit with a cushioning soil zone of smaller sand and gravel should prevent this problem. Ideally, the earth material adjacent to conduits in the im pervious zone of fill s hould be reasonably well graded, have a maximum particle size no greater than 1\u00bd inches, including earth clods , a minimum of 50 percent by weight pas sing a No. 200 s ieve, and a plas ticity index between 10 and 30 per cent. The water content of the mater ial as previous ly dis cussed should be between 1 per cent and 3 per cent wet of optimum. Dispersive clay and tr eatments are discussed in s ection 5.3.3. Flowable fill (als o known as controlled low s trength materials ) is not recommended for backfilling around conduits in significant and high hazard embankment dams , due to the f ollowing r easons: Flowable fill does not bond to either the conduit material or the adjacent foundation in which it is in contact. Measures are required to intercept flow along the inter face between the f lowabable f ill and f oundation or conduit. 120 Chapter 5\u2014F oundation and Embankment Dam The flowable fill will develop interior cracks (shrinkage) that s hould be intercepted with filter diaphragms to ensure no movement of soil particles. Flowable fill may be applicable for low hazard embankment dam applications , if used in conjunction with a filter diaphragm or collar. Use of a filter diaphragm or collar is a valuable def ensive des ign meas ure, even f or low hazar d classification s ites with favorable conditions . The use of a lean concrete in lieu of flowable fill may allow for elimination of the filter diaphragm or collar, but eliminating this valuable feature should be car efully cons idered and jus tified bas ed on extr emely f avorable soil conditions, good conduit construction materials and methods, reliable construction practices , and favorable foundation conditions . Conditions where flowable fill may be applicable for low hazard embankment dams include: Backfilling trenches dug in relatively nonyielding materials , such as bedrock or glacial till in which a conduit is installed. Flowable fill provides a uniform material surrounding the conduit, which has strain properties similar to those of the adjacent f oundation. This would allow s omewhat s teeper side slopes for the excavation. Design of the flowable fill provides similar deformation characteris tics in the cured fill as in the adjacent foundation materials . 5.3.2 Compaction of backfill material agains t conduit Recommendations for compaction of soils and rock zones against the conduit are as follows : Minimum s trength.\u2014Prior to pla cing emba nkment a djacent to the conduit, the concrete must have attained minimum strength. Minimum strength should be based on anticipated/estimated loading conditions (i.e., construction surcharge, embankment load, etc.). As a rule of thumb, placing embankment should not begin until curing of the concrete is completed (typica lly 7 to 14 da ys after concrete placement) and the concrete has achieved its design strength. Avera ge moisture content .\u2014The aver age mois ture content dur ing compaction should be in the range of 1 percent dry to 3 percent wet of optimum content, wher e optimum water content is defined by a Standar d Proctor ener gy (AST M D 698) compaction tes t. The compacted unit weight of the backfill around the conduit should be equivalent to that required for the surrounding soil. Angular particles.\u2014Earthfill placed within 2 feet of the conduit s hould not contain large angular particles that could damage the conduit from compactive effort us ed in compacting s oils near the conduit. In rockfill zones , a cus hion 121Conduits through Embankment Dams zone of smaller granular particles should be used to prevent damage to the conduit from the point loading of rocks in the earthfill. Permeabilities.\u2014Earthfill immediately adjacent to conduits should be compacted, so that no layers of material with permeabilities higher than in the adjacent earthfill extend in an ups tream and downs tream direction along the conduit. Ramping of earth mate rial.\u2014The earthfill s hould be ramped agains t the conduit on a slope of 6H:1V (figure 83) to help force the earthfill agains t the conduit and to avoid contacting the conduit with the frame of the pneumatic roller used for compaction. Pneumatic rollers should be operated in a direction parallel to the conduit. The pneumatic roller may form rutting and a smooth surface on the earthfill layer that will need s carification before new layers are placed. Lateral movement.\u2014Earthfill s hould be maintained at approximately the s ame elevation on both s ides of the conduit during backfilling. This will help to prevent later al movement of the conduit caus ed by unequal compaction ener gy applied to the sides of the conduit. Disking .\u2014The area adjacent to a conduit is normally a highly tr afficked ar ea, due to a ctivities involved with the insta llation of the conduit. Disking, a s well as being sure to eliminate drying cracks and moistening of surfaces before adding s ubsequent lif ts are required to pr event s mooth s urfaces between lif ts. Compaction.\u2014Compacting soil next to large conduits requires different approaches than for compacting soil next to smaller conduits. A single recommended approach is not possible for a wide range of conditions. Generally, compacting soil surrounding larger conduits may employ pneumatic- tired rollers or similar equipment, which is operated parallel to the conduit. On smaller conduits, operating large equipment near the conduit can damage the conduit, and hand compaction may be required. Compacting soil within 2 feet of a conduit with heavy equipment, such as tamping rollers or vibratory steel- wheeled rollers is usually inadvis able. Hand controlled mechanical compactors (also known as tampers or wackers) have been used frequently in the past. Handheld compactors should not weigh less tha n 100 pounds. A much thinner lift thickness tha n the rest of the embankment dam is required when using handheld compactors. Hand compaction is often slow, labor intensive, and tends to lag surrounding embankment dam placement. Hand compaction requires more effort to obtain proper moisture and density, may require special gradation of soil particles, and requires intense inspection and at times is a source of irritation to both contractor and owner. This results in a tendency to concentrate more on progress than good construction techniques. Operators of handheld 122 Chapter 5\u2014F oundation and Embankment t side slopes. compactors often try to s horten compaction time by utilizing thicker lifts and not as much compaction. For these reasons, handheld compactors should be avoided, if possible. Close inspection is needed to ens ure proper results, and extens ive tes ting is required to ens ure a quality earthfill. Even with the bes t of efforts , substandard earthfill material next to the conduit may occur, which increas es the probability of poor ly bonded lift s urfaces, low dens ity zones and poor bond between the earthfill and s tructure and res ult in the development of s eepage paths (Reclamation, 1987c, pp. A- 1 and A- 2). In some special cas es, certain ar eas of large conduits may not be accessible to heavy compaction equipment and the use of handheld types of compactors may be unavoidable. Handheld compactor s may be r equired wher e space available f or large compaction equipment is limited. Designers should cons ider this potential and avoid the need for hand compaction to the extent possible. Cons truction s pecifications should als o ensure that hand-compacted earthfill is not compacted at too dry a water content. A wetter earthfill material will be more deformable and will res ult in better dens ities and bond. The earthfill next to the conduit s hould be compacted at water content between 1 per cent and 3 percent wet of Standard Proctor optimum. Control testing .\u2014The frequency of control testing should be as often as necessary to ens ure that the earthfill adjacent to the conduit is properly compacted. At least one dry unit weight and moisture content control test should be taken during each s hift. Use of a penetr ometer to locate low dr y unit weight zones , as a supplement to r egular contr ol testing, can gr eatly incr ease the ef fectivenes s . Dry unit weig ht control.\u2014Dry unit weight control of the earthfill within 1 or 2 inches of the conduit s urface is difficult us ing conventional tes t procedur es. The inspector should make us e of a penetr ometer , a knif e blade, or whatever 123 Conduits through Embankment Dams device is neces sary to make s ure that the earthfill is compacted tightly agains t the structure and no voids are present. The soil's mois ture content s hould be checked, s o that it matches the or iginally intended water content. Closure section .\u2014Conduits are often located in clos ure sections within embankment dams. Section 5.2 discusses several important design considerations for closure sections. Another important factor for the closure section is the potential f or expos ed surfaces to become des iccated bef ore the closure section is filled. Before adding compacted s oil to an area that has been expos ed, the s oil should be car efully ins pected f or evidence of desiccation cracking. Soil with desiccation cracks must be removed, moistened, and recompacted before allowing s ubsequent earthfill operations to res ume. Poorly bonded lifts will res ult from placing compacted s oil on a s urface that has been allowed to dr y. Hydr aulic f ractur e can cr eate a pathway f or inter nal erosion in this zone of the earthfill. Often a few feet in depth of the exis ting embankment surface is mois tened and r ewor ked. 5.3.3 Dispersive clay backfill Embankment dams usually contain a zone of lower permeability s oil to reduce the seepage thr ough the embankment. In small embankment dams , the entir e dam may be constructed of the same soil, termed a homogeneous construction. If this zone of low per meability, clayey s oil develops cracks, particular ly transverse cracks, from hydraulic fracture, desiccation, or other causes, the integrity of the embankment dam may be compromis ed. Water flowing through a crack in any s oil will erode and enlar ge the cr ack, unles s the cr ack is able to s well clos ed bef ore erosion occur s. If the cr ack continues to er ode, this can lead to a br eaching of the embankment dam. Figures 84 and 85 show failures known to be associated with highly dispersive clay embankments. Figure 84 shows a small embankment dam that failed when water flowed along a tr ansverse crack in the dam. The transverse crack was caus ed by hydraulic fracture of the earthfill as sociated with differential s ettlement near the conduit. Failures of embankment dams constructed of dispersive clays without appropriate defensive design measures have been common (figure 85). These lower permeability zones are intended primarily to reduce s eepage in embankment dams . They may be s uccessful in this regard, but if they develop cracks , they can s till perform uns atisfactorily. The eros ion res istance of thes e zones depends on several factors, including the gradation, degree of compaction and compacted water content, plas ticity and electr ochemical compos ition. ticity with an compa cted to a high percent their permeability. The leas 5\u2014F oundation and Embankment Dam Figure 84 .\u2014An embankment da m in Mississippi constructed of di spersi ve clay soil, failed on fi rst filling with low reservoir level. Failure was likely caused by cr acks from differential settlem ent, hydr aulic fracture, or poor compaction about the outlet wor ks condui t. This embankment da m had no filter. Figure 85 .\u2014Thi s embankment da m constr ucted wi th dispersive clays failed on first filling of the da m. 125 Conduits through Embankment Dams Soils with low plas ticity indices are also more likely to exper ience r apid inter nal erosion than soils with higher plasticity, as water flows through the soils or along an interface between the s oil and an object, s uch as a conduit or bedr ock in contact with the s oil. The failure of T eton Dam in 1976 in Idaho illus trates the s peed with which failure can occur in internal eros ion involving low plas ticity embankment s oils. Some embankment dams contain zones of broadly graded soil with sufficient fines content to be cons idered low in permeability, but the s oils are found to be s ubject to suffosion from internal ins tability. The low res istance to internal eros ion of broadly graded s oils is well documented in r eferences by Gar ner and Sobkowicz (2002), Sherard (1979), and LaFleur, Mlynarek, and Rollin (ASCE, 1989). The internal instability of thes e soils results from the ability of finer s oil particles to be mobilized between lar ger particles in thes e broadly gr aded s oils. This soil movement, ter med suffosion, results in sinkholes, if erosion progresses long enough. Designing filters using current criteria has been shown to be effective in blocking internal erosion in these soil types . Dispersive clays differ from \"nor mal\" clays becaus e of their electr ochemical properties. The paper by Sherard, Decker, and R yker (1972b, p. 589) has good discussions on the r easons dispersive clays ' chemis try influences their behavior so strongly. From that paper, The main property of the cla y governing the suscepti bility to di spersion piping is the quantity of di ssolved sodi um cations in the por e water relative to the qua ntities of other main basic cations (ca lcium and magnesium). The sodi um acts to i ncrease the thickness of the di ffused double wa ter la yer surroundi ng individual clay particles and hence to decrea se the a ttractive force between the pa rticles, m aking it easier for individual particles to be deta ched from the m ass. Flow thr ough cr acks in dis persive clays can quickly er ode the cr acks and lead to rapid enlar gement of the cr acks. Failures caus ed by inter nal erosion in dis persive clay dams are common. Several case histories presented in appendix B discuss failures associated with inter nal erosion in dis persive clay s oils. The intent of chimney f ilters and f ilter diaphr agms around conduits is to inter cept f low occur ring in cracks in the embankment dam, to seal the flow of water by developing a filter cake at the f ace of the f ilter. See s ection 6.4 f or additional dis cussion concer ning filters . Identifying dis persive clays requires special tes ts that ar e not always routinely performed. The tests mos t commonly us ed for identif ying dis persive clays are the crumb test (ASTM D 6572), the hydrometer pinhole test (ASTM D 4647). The pinhole tes t is a direct meas ure of the erodibility of a s oil. A 1-mm hole is formed in a s pecimen of soil, and water is forced thr ough the hole at incr easing 126 Chapter 5\u2014F oundation and Embankment Dam heads . A dis persive clay s oil will erode rapidly under a low 2-inch head within 10 minutes of flow initiation. A non dispersive clay usually undergoes little erosion, even under sustained flow through the hole under a head of up to 40 inches. The test is performed using standard procedures established in ASTM D 4647. Two tests have been developed to study the erosion characteristics of soil in addition to the pinhole test, which is used exclusively to evaluate dispersive clays: the slot erosion test and the hole erosion test (Wan and Fell, 2004). Australian researchers at the Univer sity of New South Wales developed thes e tests, which ar e not widely us ed in the United States . The erosion char acteristics are des cribed in thes e supplemental tests by the erosion rate index, which indicates the rate of erosion due to fluid traction, and the cr itical s hear stress, which r epresents the minimum s hear stress when er osion starts. Results of the two laboratory erosion tests are strongly correlated. Values of the erosion rate index span from 0 to 6, indicating that two soils can differ in their rates of erosion by up to 6 times. Coarse grained soils, in general, are less erosion resistant than fine grained soils. The erosion rate indices of coarse grained soils show good correlation with the f ines and clay contents , and the degr ee of saturation of the s oils. The erosion rate indices of fine grained soils show moderately good correlation with the degr ee of saturation. The abs ence of soils with the clay miner als called s mectites and ver miculites , and appar ently the pr esence of cementing mater ials, such as iron oxides, improve the erosion resistance of a fine grained soil. The hole erosion test is proposed as a simple index test for quantifying the rate of internal eros ion in a s oil, and for finding the approximate critical s hear stress corresponding to initiation of internal erosion. Knowledge of these erosion characteristics of the core soil of an embankment da m aids assessme nt of the likelihood of dam failure due to internal erosion. See the NRCS's Dispersive Clays (1991) for more detailed discussions of methods for identif ying dis persive clays . Another reference (Sher ard, Dunnigan, and Decker , 1976, pp. 287-301) also discusses identification of di spersive clays. A filter around conduits is impor tant wher e dispersive clays are used for embankment dam construction. The dimensions of a filter should be increased becaus e dispersive clays are s o dangerous to the integrity of an earthfill. An embankment chimney drain/filter that extends completely acros s an earthfill, from one abutment to the other, extending upwards to the normal pool height or higher, is often used. See chapter 6 for design and construction of filters. Treating dis persive clays with chemical amendments may be ef fective in r educing their erodibility, but this alternative may be cos tly, except with s pecific embankment zones . Treating dis persive clays used as backfill in cutoff trenches and on the outer 127 Conduits through Embankment Dams slopes of embankments are examples . Sever al chemicals have been us ed to modif y dispersive clays. The most common additive is hydrated lime. The NRCS reference on dispersive clays (NRCS, 1991) discusses chemical amendment in more detail. However, the des igner is cautioned that treatment with lime will increas e the material's brittleness. Chimney f ilters that coincide with a f ilter diaphr agm or collar around conduits are the pr eferred method f or preventing f ailures associated with dis persive clays . Embankment dams constructed of dispersive clays should use a substantial filter diaphr agm ar ound the conduit, if a chimney f ilter is not included in the des ign of the dam. 5.4 Fros t susceptibility and ice lens es Some s oils, especially s ilts, are frost susceptible. When conduits are in contact with frost-susceptible s oils, large ice lens es may f orm in the s oil if the conduit is expos ed to freezing temper atures. When thes e ice lens es melt, voids are left in the ear thfill that ar e subject to inter nal erosion, if they ar e connected to the r eservoir and continuous in a dir ection tr ansverse to the embankment dam. This is a suspected failure mode in the Anita Dam and Loveton Farms Dam failures (see appendix B ) and Kels o Dam in s outhern Ontario, Canada (Milligan, 2003, pp. 786-787). Guidance concerning fros t susceptibility and ice lens es includes : Process of ice lens form ation.\u2014When wet s oil freezes , mos t of the water in the s oil pores becomes ice, and it expands about 10 per cent (Sower s, 1979). However , in frost-susceptible s oils, it has been f ound that not all of the water freezes . Capillary s oil water may remain in liquid form at temperatures of 28 \u00b0F, and some liquid water may even s till exis t at temperatures as low as -4 \u00b0F (Penner, 1962, p. 1). When the water in the lar ger pores freezes , the mois ture content in the soil is reduced, and unfrozen capillary water in the s urrounding s oil tends to migrate towar d the f rozen zone becaus e of surface tens ion. The frozen water becomes an ice lens , which will draw water from the s urrounding s oil as long as unfrozen water is available and the temper ature at the lens remains cold. The result is that the ice lens grows larger, and the total expans ion of the s oil is much lar ger than that which would occur with the expans ion of the or iginal amount of water present in the soil. The growth of these ice lens es creates very large pressures in the s oil, creating frost heave within the embankment dam. These forces can damage r igid conduits and can caus e exces sive def ormation of flexible conduits resulting in pathways for inter nal erosion. When the ice lens defrosts, it can cr eate a void or low density zone that can initiate the internal erosion process. 128 Chapter 5\u2014F oundation and Embankment Dam Frost-suscep tible soils .\u2014Silts and s ilty soils are the mos t frost susceptible, becaus e the voids can be of capillary s ize, and the permeability of the s oil is sufficient for migration of pore water. Fine grained clays are not conducive to formation of large ice lens es, becaus e they ar e too imper meable to allow s ubstantial migration of the s oil water . Sands and gr avels with les s than 3 per cent f ines content (material finer than 0.075 mm, No. 200 sieve) are not generally frost susceptible (Reclamation, 1998a, p. 54). Thousands of embankment dams constructed of frost-susceptible materials have experienced no apparent problems. For both case histories in appendix B wher e ice lens es are suspected as contr ibuting f actors in dam f ailure, the conduits were relatively lar ge metal pipes . Such lar ge pipes may allow s ufficient cold air flow thr ough them to caus e the adjacent embankment s oils to freeze, while the heat in flowing water in smaller conduits may minimize the problem. Also, the meta l pipes a re rela tively thin, so cold tempera tures a re transmitted to the surrounding s oil relatively quickly. Cold temperatures would take longer to affect the s oils surrounding conduits with thicker concr ete walls . Design consid erations.\u2014Backfilling adjacent to conduits with clayey mater ials would minimize the potential for formation of ice lenses in the embankment dam. Also, construction of a properly designed filter diaphragm or collar near the downs tream end of the conduit would contr ol seepage along the outs ide of the conduit and minimize the potential for failure by internal erosion. 129Conduits through Embankment Dams 130 Chapter 6 Filter Zo nes Zones of designed f ilter mater ial have become the accepted method of preventing failures caused by uncontrolled flow of water through the embankment materials and foundation soils surrounding a conduit through an embankment dam. This chapter discusses the theory behind the concept for using filter zones to prevent erosion of earthen embankments near conduits caused by the uncontrolled flow of water through soils surrounding conduits that penetrate the embankment. The type and configuration of the filter zone depend on site conditions and soils used in the embankment dam. Three bas ic des ignations for filter zones associated with conduits are discussed: filter diaphr agms , filter collar s, and chimney f ilters. Examples of typical des igns used by the major design agencies are included. 6.1 Theory of filter s eal development The concept behind the function of a filter in sealing a concentrated flow was developed largely from laboratory experiments under the guidance of Sherard as reported in s everal references (Sherard, Dunnigan, and T albot, 1984). Figure 86 (top) is reproduced from this reference, and it illus trates filter cake development in the laboratory experiments. Figure 86 (bottom) shows the action of the filter in sealing a concent rated leak in an embankment dam. 6.2 Federal agency policy on filters for conduits The following policy concerning filter zones has been summarized from three of the major federal agencies that have been tr aditionally involved with embankment dam construction: Bureau of Reclamatio n.\u2014From R eclamation's, Embankme nt nt Design (1992, p. 21): Structures thr ough embankments should be a voided unless econom ics or site geology dictates thei r use.

The fi lter seal results i n a thin zone of soil with a slurry-li ke consistency a nd a perm eability similar to tha t of the soi ls that eroded to for m the sea l (after Sher ard, Dunni gan, and Talbot, 1984) . 132 Chapter 6\u2014F ilter seepa ge or lea kage along the surfa ce of the structure or throug h adjacent i m pervious zones i s the use of a properly desi gned filter and drainage zones a round the condui t dow nstream of the i mpervious cor e along with qua lity constr ucted fill adjacent to the str ucture.

Filter zones are provided in embankment dam designs to meet various requirements and conditions. Filters serve the following purposes (ASDSO, 2003): For wa ter seeping through the na tural voids of the soil (emba nkment da m or foundation), a drainage system is designed to intercept this seepage and carry it to a safe outlet. A filter consists of a graded sand and/or gravel material designed to prevent the migration of soil particles from the base soil being drained. The filter supports the soil discharge face, and no movement of soil occurs with water flow. 133 Conduits through Embankment Dams Filters are placed next to the s oil. If needed, one or more coar ser zones are placed behind the filter to serve as the drain. Collection pipes may be used to carry the wa ter to a safe outlet. If the filter has sufficient permeability, it can s erve as both the drain and the filter. Filters also intercept cracks, openings, or other anomalies where water flow has the potential to develop a concentr ated leak. In cracks or openings, filters intercept soil moving in suspension with the water; a filter cake is formed that s eals the cr ack and pr events further erosion. FEMA is sponsoring the development of a \"best practices\" guidance document for filters used in embankment dams . This document will contain detailed procedures and guidelines for des ign and cons truction of filters . The des ign manual will be based on exper ience pr ovided f rom exper ts in the f ields of geotechnical engineer ing and construction. The expected publication date is 2007. Filters used in conjunction with conduits through embankment dams generally fall into thr ee br oad categor ies: chimney f ilters, filter diaphr agms , and f ilter collar s. These filters are discussed in the f ollowing s ections . 6.3 Chimney filters A chimney filter that extends upward to the highest probable pool level and extends across the length of the embankment from abutment to abutment is a common element for most high and significant hazard embankment dams. Chimney drains are also valuable f or sites with a high per manent water storage level, becaus e they intercept and lower the phr eatic line and maintain a s tronger downs tream zone of unsaturated s oil. Figure 87 s hows a double gradation zone chimney filter being installed in the construction of a modern embankment dam. Chimney filter zones are a valuable protection against internal erosion in transverse cracks that could occur in the embankment dam. Chimney f ilters are also commonly used when embankment dams contain zones of widely varying gradation. The chimney f ilter provides a transition and f iltering capability between thes e zones . Multiple filter and drain zones may be required in embankment dams that include zones of soils with a wider range in gradation. Examples are embankment dams with zones of impervious, finer grained soils with coarse shell zones of rock or gravel fill. 134Chapter 6\u2014F ilter Zones Figure 87 .\u2014Two sta ge chimney fi lter wi thin an embankment da m located in Texas. Embankment dams with chimney filters do not normally require a separate feature to control internal erosion or backward erosion piping along the conduit. The chimney filter will us ually encompas s the conduit and s erve the function of a filter diaphragm as well as the other primary functions of a chimney filter, such as providing trans ition filter capability and controlling the phreatic line. Figure 88 (top) s hows a zoned embankment dam with a chimney filter constructed along the interface between the centr al cor e of the dam and the downs tream shell. The chimney f ilter encompas ses the conduit at the inter section and s erves as a filter diaphr agm as well as a chimney f ilter. Figure 88 (bottom) illus trates a des ign where an embankment chimney filter als o serves as a filter diaphragm around the conduit. This example is for a homogeneous embankment with a vertical chimney filter. Chimney filters are typically ins talled in new construction or within embankment dams undergoing extensive renovation. Figure 89 provides another example of a typical design used for a high hazard embankment dam. This design includes a chimney f ilter, a dr ain at the downs tream edge of the cutof f trench, and a f oundation blanket dr ain. The chimney f ilter and cutoff drain satisfy the functions of a filter diaphragm around the conduit. The blanket dr ain serves as an outlet f or the collected s eepage f low. The des ign shown is typical for embankment dams that have distinctly different materials in the core zone and the exterior shells of the dam. The foundation blanket drain may also function to collect seepage in bedrock or permeable foundation horizons, and function to convey collected s eepage to the downs tream toe.

Some low hazar d embankment dams may not include a chimney f ilter for the entir e length of the dam, if the f ollowing f actors are present: The embankment dam is constructed of soil(s) with a good resistance to both internal erosion and backward erosion piping. Particularly important is that dispersive clays are not us ed in the cons truction. 136 Chapter 6\u2014F ilter Zones Figure 89 .\u2014Typi cal desi gn used for em bankment da ms with distinctly different materials in the core zone and ext erior shells of the dam. Zones of widely varying grain size are not used adjacent to one another in the cross section. Examples include cor e zones of fine gr ained s oil with exter ior zones of coars er gravel or rockfill. Abrupt changes in the cr oss section tr ansverse to the center line ar e not pr esent. Examples are bedr ock ledges , clos ure sections , and excavated tr enches . Good oversight of construction is provided, including quality assurance and contr ol that ar e cons istent and ef fective. Special care is taken in following recommendations for compaction of fill surrounding the conduit, as discussed in section 5.3.2. If a chimney drain is not included in the design of a low hazard embankment dam, the design measures for preventing internal erosion or backward erosion piping along the conduit may consist of three basic choices: 1. A filter diaphragm is a valuable defensive design measure even for low hazard classification embankment dams with favorable site conditions. The filter diaphragm will intercept flow along dis continuities along the pipe or through 137 Conduits through Embankment Dams cracks in the earthfill immediately s urrounding the conduit that are caus ed by differential s ettlement as sociated with the conduit. Cracks in the ear thfill surrounding the conduit may also be caused by desiccation during interruptions of fill placement, hydraulic fracture, and other mechanis ms discussed in this document. Section 6.4 discuss filter diaphragm considerations in detail. 2. A filter collar is sometimes used rather than a filter diaphragm. This configuration protects against flow directly along a conduit, but does not address potential flow in cracks that may occur in the soils surrounding the conduit. Section 6.5 dis cusses in more detail the guidelines for us ing a filter collar rather than a filter diaphragm. 3. Some des ign agencies , including the NRCS, s till allow the us e of antis eep collars as a defensive design measure to address flow along conduits for low hazard embankment dams with favorable soil and site conditions. Some regulations by State and other entities may als o require the us e of antis eep collar s. As discussed in detail in appendix A, the theory behind the development of antiseep collar s is flawed, and their continued us e may be cons idered a r elic of conventional des ign. Becaus e antis eep collar s impede the unif orm compaction of backfill along the conduit, and their theoretical bas is is not s ound, their us e has been lar gely abandoned. The only likely benef it of antis eep collar s would be an interruption of flow that might occur from poor construction practices on circular conduits where the pipe is dislodged by construction efforts or backfill under the haunches of the pipe is loose. However, antis eep collars are not r ecommended as the \"bes t practice\" appr oach to the des ign of conduits . 6.4 Filter diaphragms A filter diaphragm is an important component of design for both new construction and the renovation of older embankment dams. Some low hazard embankment dams constructed of soils that are inherently resistant to internal erosion or backward erosion piping may not include a chimney filter zone for the entire length of the dam. However, thes e embankment dams should s till contain a filter diaphragm around any conduits within the dam. As discussed in s ection 6.3, chimney f ilters are used in many embankment dam designs, both new and renovation. The chimney filter zone can usually satisfy the function of a filter diaphragm. A separate component is not required for those embankment dams , if the chimney f ilter surrounds the conduit in a s imilar fashion as the filter diaphr agm would. A filter diaphragm (figures 90 and 91) is a designed zone of filter material constructed around a conduit in which a chimney filter is not being used (usually in 138 Chapter 6\u2014F ilter Zones Figure 90 .\u2014Constr uction of a filter diaphragm within an embankment da m. Figure 91 .\u2014Typi cal confi guration for filter diaphragm used i n the desi gn of an embankment da m. the renovation of an existing embankment dam). This zone can act both as a drain to ca rry off wa ter and as a filter to intercept soil pa rticles being tra nsported by the water. The filter diaphragm will intercept both intergranular flow through the embankment dam and flow through cracks in the earthfill or along the interface between the conduit and the ear thfill. Any f ines being er oded f rom the embankment will be filtered by the diaphragm of s and that s urrounds the conduit. The fines 139 Conduits through Embankment Dams carried by the flowing water will accumulate on the s urface of the diaphragm and develop a f ilter cake. The filter cake that develops on the ups tream face of the f ilter diaphr agm r educes the f low and pr events further erosion of any cr acks caus ed by this flow. The filter diaphragm must extend far enough from the conduit that it can intercept all potential water flow paths associated with the conduit. A filter diaphragm is typically installed during new construction or with conduit renovations. If the only pos tulated f low path is immediately along the contact between the earthfill and the conduit, the filter diaphragm may not need to extend far from the conduit. As an example, s ome agencies only us e a filter diaphr agm 18 inches thick, which is similar to a f ilter collar . In other cases, the embankment dam may be subject to hydraulic fracture in zones that are far above and on either side of the conduit. In the abs ence of a chimney f ilter, the f ilter diaphr agm may need to be much wider a nd taller tha n the dimensions of the conduit to intercept those cra cks. A filter diaphragm that extends farther from the conduit is often recommended for designs wher e significant dif ferential s ettlement is associated with the conduit and/or the tr ench us ed to ins tall the conduit. This type of filter diaphr agm is often us ed for embankment dams cons tructed without a chimney f ilter, when s oils with a ver y low resistance to inter nal erosion, s uch as dispersive clays , are used to cons truct the dam. This type of diaphragm is a zone of designed gradation filter sand that completely encir cles the conduit. The shape of the f ilter diaphr agm is usually either rectangular or trapezoidal, and the diaphragm is typically 3 feet thick. Figure 91 shows a typical configuration for a filter diaphragm. For further guidance on recommended dimensions for a filter diaphragm, see NR CS's Earth Da ms and Reservoirs (1990) and Dimensioning of Filter Drainage Diaphrams for Conduits According to TR60 (1989). The NRCS f ilter diaphr agm typically has the f ollowing char acteristics. Agency policy and the judgment of the individual designer may dictate different dimensions: Configuratio n.\u2014The filter diaphr agm is a rectangular or trapezoidally s haped zone of filter sand that is about 3 feet wide in a direction perpendicular to the conduit; s ee figure 91. Location.\u2014Locating the filter diaphragm along a conduit depends on several site conditions. If the embankment is zoned, the filter is often located at the juncture of the impervious core zone and downstream shell zone. In a homogeneous embankment dam, the location of the filter diaphragm is usually based on the following requirements: 1. Downs tream of the cutof f trench. 2. Downs tream of the center line of the embankment dam when no cutof f trench is used. 140 Chapter 6\u2014F ilter Zones 3. Upstream of a point where the top of the filter diaphragm has at least a thicknes s of soil overlying it that is a minimum of one-half of the difference in elevation between the top of the diaphr agm and the maximum pote ntial reservoir w ater level. The rationale for the third requirement is that if an open crack occurred within the embankment dam and the full reservoir water pressure was acting on the crack, tha t pressure would be tra nsmitted a long the cra ck with little hea d loss to the point wher e the cr ack inter cepted the f ilter diaphr agm. At that point, the crack would pr esumably be s ealed f rom s loughed par ticles carried along the crack to the f ace of the f ilter diaphr agm. Then, at that inter face between the open cr ack wit h a seal and t he filter diaphr agm ( see figure 86 ostatic pr essure could exis t. The criterion is intended then to ensure that the weight of over lying s oil in the embankment counter s this hydrostatic pressure. The rule requiring the thickness of one-half the reservoir head is based on the s implification that the unit weight of mois t earthfill is approximately twice the unit weight of water . Vertical/horizontal limits .\u2014The filter diaphragm should extend below and to either side of the conduit far enough to intercept potential flow along excavation/embankment inter faces. Usually, the f ilter diaphr agm extends into the founda tion a dimension equa l to a t least 1.5 times the dia meter of the conduit, unless bedrock is encountered at a shallower depth. Lateral limits .\u2014The filter diaphragm us ually extends laterally a dis tance at leas t equal to 3 times the diameter of the conduit or a minimum of 10 feet from the sides of the conduit. In some situations the filter diaphragm may need to be wider than thes e minimum s uggested dimens ions. For instance, if an excavation has been made for the conduit, the filter diaphragm should notch into the excavation s lopes by at leas t 2 feet; s ee figure 92. A des igner s hould cons ider s everal factors in determining the dimens ions to us e for a filter diaphragm, as follows : Whether a filter d iaphragm is a \"stand-alone\" elem ent of the em bankment dam's design, or if it is a coincidental part of a chimney filter in the dam .\u2014Many embankment dams include a chimney f ilter that extends across the entir e length of the dam. When the chimney f ilter is located wher e it can als o encompas s the conduit pas sing through the embankment dam, a separate filter diaphragm is not required. Figure 88 shows two configurations commonly used for chimney filters that would serve the function of a filter diaphragm, as well as the functions of a chimney f ilter. 141Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 92 .\u2014Typi cal confi guration for filter diaphragm used i n design of an embankment da m. The fi lter diaphragm should ex tend i nto the founda tion soils, where a n excavation is made for the condui t. The type of equipment used to construct the filter diaphragm .\u2014If a chimney f ilter is used in the design of the embankment dam and it serves the coincidental purpose of a filter diaphragm, then dimensions appropriate for a chimney filter should be used. Many times , chimney f ilters are sized f or the width of equipment (about 10 to 12 feet) to a ccommoda te production equipment in pla cing and compacting this zone in the embankment cross section. In small embankment dams wher e the cos t of the chimney f ilter may be exces sive, a nar rower width may be cons idered. The method of constructing the filter zone .\u2014If the chimney f ilter zone or filter diaphragm is cons tructed concurrently with the adjoining fill zones , using a width of 10 to 12 feet is suited to most construction equipment. A chimney filter des igned with multiple filter zones complicates cons truction. Figure 87 shows such a des ign. If the f ilter zone is placed in a tr ench cut in compacted fill, a width of 3 feet is often s pecified, becaus e that is typically the width of backhoe buckets used for this method of construction. A paper by Hammer (2003) includes good discussions of the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for constructing chimney filter zones. The discussions would apply equally well to s ites wher e only a f ilter diaphr agm was used ins tead of a full chimney filter s ection. The trenching method is illustrated in figures 6, 7, and 8 of that paper. The p redicted zones of em bankment suscep tible to hyd raulic fra cture resulting from the presence of the cond uit in the fill .\u2014The filter diaphragm s hould extend vertically and laterally far enough to intercept all zones of the fill and foundation that are susceptible to hydr aulic f ractur e attributable to the pr esence of the conduit in the dam. Hydraulic fracture is discussed in s ection 5.2. Hydraulic fracture zones not caused by the conduit, but by other factors, such as steeply dipping 142 Chapter 6\u2014F ilter Zones bedrock s urfaces, are usually addr essed with chimney f ilter zones in addition to a filter diaphr agm. The ability of the filter diaphragm to prevent propagation of a crack through the zone .\u2014The purpos e of a filter diaphragm is to intercept cracks in the earthfill and collect and f ilter any f low er oding the walls of the cr ack. The filter zone mus t be thick enough to prevent a crack from propagating through the filter. Many designers consider a thicknes s of 3 feet as adequate to s atisfy this requirement. Other factors important in crack propagation include the gradation of the filter used for the diaphr agm, its degr ee of compaction, and the potential f or cementation of the filter. For less favorable conditions, wider filter diaphragms may be advis able. Intergranular seepage pas sing thr ough the f ilter diaphr agm may be collected and conveyed downs tream to the toe of the embankment dam with var ious design approaches . The outlet dr ain to convey the collected f low may be a combination of granular filters and it may or may not include a per forated collector pipe. Figure 93 shows one type of outlet drain for a filter diaphragm. This figure shows an outlet drain consisting of a zone of gravel surrounded by a fine sand filter, without a collector pipe. Collector pipes may als o be included in the des igns for outlet dr ains for filter diaphragms, particularly to provide a safety factor for conveying larger than expected flow quantities. Many designers contend that outlet drains should be designed to have a capacity to convey all of the collected f low in the gr anular zones alone, without considering the additional capacity provided by a collector pipe\u2014the reason being that the collector pipe could eventually be damaged or otherwise become inoperative, and the granular zone would s till be functional. The estimated f low quantity that f ilter diaphr agms are required to convey depends primarily on the predicted quantity of intergranular seepage, not flow through cracks that ar e inter cepted by the diaphr agm. If properly des igned, the f ilter diaphr agm will form a seal on the f ace of any inter cepted cr acks, and s ubsequent f low thr ough the face of the crack at the filter will be s imilar to intergranular s eepage. In addition to the dimensions of filter diaphragms, designers must also decide whether to use a sloping zone or a vertical configuration for the diaphragm. Each configuration has advantages and disadvantages: Sloping configuration .\u2014Filter diaphr agms and chimney f ilters may als o be constructed with a s loping configuration, as illustrated in figure 88 (top). This configuration is more common on larger embankment dams and those with distinct zones in the dam. The filter zone is often placed at the juncture between the cor e and s hell zones in the dam as shown in f igure 88 (top). This configuration r educes the ef fect of differential s ettlements between the f ilter zone and the adjacent embankment zones. Because sloping zones are typically 143 Conduits through Embankment Dams Place the filter diaphragm as far downstream as possible, leaving Extend top of filter diaphragm up to normal reservoir elevation at least two feet of cover over it Granular drain (surrounded by filter sand) Conduit Filter diaphragm to convey seepage to downstream toe. The exit details are not shown. Figure 93 .\u2014Typi cal confi guration for a filter diaphragm used i n the desi gn of an embankment da m. The fi gure shows the loca tion of the fi lter di aphragm as far downstrea m as possible, leaving adequate cover over it. wider than ver tical zones , differential s ettlement occur s over a wider distance, also lessening the potential f or cracking as sociated with the dif ferential settlement. Collaps e of the filter zone on wetting is still a concern, and proper compaction control is needed, as it is for a vertical zone. Sloping configuration zones have a lower potential to cause cracking of the surrounding embankment zones for reasons listed and ar e preferable when the des ign per mits. Constructing a sloping filter diaphragm would be considerably more difficult for small homogeneous embankments, and this configuration is seldom used for those designs. Vertical configuration .\u2014This configuration for a filter diaphragm is the one commonly used. Figure 88 (bottom) shows a vertical zone for the filter zone surrounding a conduit (In this case the zone is a combination filter diaphragm and chimney filter, but illus trates the s hape for a des ign us ing a s maller filter diaphragm as well). Vertical filter diaphragms are commonly constructed using the trenching method, as shown in the paper by Hammer (2003). This shape of filter diaphragm is common in embankment dams that do not have distinct 144 Chapter 6\u2014F ilter Zones zones, and the engineering properties of the embankment soils on both sides of the diaphr agm ar e similar . Filter zones are typically compos ed of somewhat well gr aded r elatively clean sand, such as AST M C 33 fine concrete aggregate. The compres sibility characteris tics of this zone likely are different than thos e of the earthfill in which it is placed. This may cr eate concer n over differential s ettlement between the embankment s oils and the f ilter diaphr agm. A special concer n is the potential for collapse of the filter zone upon wetting. To reduce this potential, filters are typically compacted to a moderate degree as described in section 6.8. Becaus e any potential dif ferential s ettlement is oriented par allel to the embankment, les s concer n occur s than if the dif ferential movement wer e transverse to the emba nkment da m. For an example of a project that us ed a f ilter diaphr agm, s ee the cas e history in appendix B for Waterbury Dam. 6.5 Filter collars A filter collar cons ists of a zone of filter material (us ually s and) that completely surrounds a specified length of conduit. This type of filter is recommended, if the only f low that is cons idered likely is that along the contact between the conduit and the surrounding earthfill, and embankment s oils are not dis persive clays . A filter collar s hould be limited to s ites with few problems . If conditions exist that could caus e hydr aulic f ractur e, or if soils in the embankment dam ar e ver y low in erosion resistance (such as dispersive clays), more substantial filter zones, as discussed in s ection 6.4, s hould be us ed rather than a filter collar. A filter collar is generally used in conduit renovation or new construction. For renovations, the filter collar wraps the downstream one-third length of the conduit, and the filter is about 18 inches thick. The thickness depends upon design requirements. The USACE's Design and Construction of Levees (2000, p. 8-5) and Culverts, Conduits, and Pipes (1998a, p. 1-3) s how a typical des ign. Figures 94 and 95 illustrate an example of this type of filter des ign for a conduit renovation. The dimensions for the filter should vary with the size and complexity of the embankment dam. Larger filter collar s and multiple zones may be needed f or more complex, significant hazard to high hazard embankment dams or those with problematic s oils. The gradation of the filter collar s hould be des igned for filter compatibility with the s urrounding s oils in the embankment dam. At the downs tream end of the f ilter collar , a zone of gravel may be placed at the end f or 145 Figure 94 .\u2014Filter colla r surrounding a condui t renovation.

The gravel s hould meet f ilter criteria for the s and filter. At the very downstream toe of the embankment dam, a short section of perforated drain pipe (similar to a toe drain) is often provided to collect and convey any seepage water out of the filter collar. This collector pipe will help keep the toe area from becoming boggy. The pipe will als o provide opportunity to meas ure seepage flow and monitor for sediment transport. Provisions should be made in the design of the collector pipe to allow f or inspection by CCT V equipment. See s ection 9.5.4.4 f or a discussion of CCTV inspection. Burying the collector pipe too far into the embankment should be avoided. The gravel envelope drain should be capable of providing the needed drainage. The designer should provide access provisions for the collector pipe to enable inspection and cleaning. Also, should the collector pipe become damaged, it should be located such that it can be removed and replaced. 6.6 Filter and drain gradation des ign Designing the gr adation of the s ands used in the f ilter is impor tant if they ar e to function properly. Standard filter design methods, such as the NRCS design procedure shown in Gradatio n Design of Sand and Gr avel Filters, National Engineering Handbook, Part 633, Chapter 26 (1994), the USACE's General Desig n and Co nstructio n Considerations for Earth and Ro ck-Fll Dams (2004a), and Reclamation's Embankment Dams\u2014Protective Filters (1999) are typical. Materials suitable for filters will rarely be available onsite and are usually purchased from concrete aggregate suppliers or processed from materials near the site. For many designs, ASTM C 33 fine concrete aggregate is found to meet cr iteria. However , designers should always deter mine a range of compatible filter gradations that will protect the s oils used in the surrounding embankment to increas e cons truction flexibility. Sands used to construct filter diaphragms , filter collars , or chimney filters should be filter compatible with the embankment zones being protected, and they must also be able to deform and fill any cracks that may be propagated to the filter. If the filter does not have a property referred to as \"self-healing,\" the crack could propagate through the filter, and the f ilter would not s atisfy its intended f unction. Vaughan and Soar es (1982, p. 29) and the USACE (1993, p. 8-6) have des cribed a s imple tes t for evaluating the s elf-healing ability of a filter. Factors that influence the ability of a filter to be s elf-healing ar e the per centage of fines (percent f iner than the No. 200 sieve) and the plas ticity of the f ines. Filter designs usually r equire a low per centage of nonplastic fines (usually less than 5 percent as measured after placement in the embankment dam and compaction of the filter) to ensure that filters have adequate permeability and s elf-healing characteris tics. Fine, poorly graded filters have les s 147 Conduits through Embankment Dams desirable self-healing char acteristics than br oadly gr aded, coar se filter mater ials. However, segregation of broadly graded filters can be a serious problem. The no eros ion filter tes t described by Sherard and Dunnigan (1989, pp. 927-930) is useful in evaluating whether a specific filter gradation is filter compatible with a specific bas e embankment s oil. While exis ting filter criteria generally ens ure filter compatibility, s ite-specific tes ting us ing the no eros ion filter tes t is advis able for some situations. For high hazard embankment dams, where designers want additional documentation on the f ilter compatibility between a s pecific filter source and the embankment s oils, or wher e des igners wish to explor e whether relaxing s trict filter criteria would be s afe, conducting labor atory filter tests with actual s ite materials is advisable. Other considerations for the filter and drainage zone materials include: Granular materials should be hard and durable, s o they will not break down during transportation, placement, and compaction. Overcompaction can reduce permeability and increas e fines . The specified gradation should filter the embankment dam's core material and be permeable enough to avoid excess water pressure buildup. The filter gradation should be designed to avoid segregation during placement. A two- layer filter may be r equired for zoned embankment dams wher e the cor e and shell zones are very different. Designs for drainage zones favor permeability cons iderations over filtering criteria. Ordinarily, filters that are separate from the other embankment dam drainage zones are not expected to convey much f low, becaus e their purpose is to intercept a nd prevent flow through cra cks. The most likely damage that can occur to sand and gravel filter/drainage zones or material during construction is contamination or segregation. Segregation will occur when the filter or drain material is dumped from an end- dump truck or other hauling unit, where the material falls more than about 2 feet. Close inspection is always neces sary to make s ure segregation is not occur ring. The use of narrowly gr aded mater ials helps to pr event this problem. Wide gradations (gradations that include a wide range of particle sizes) can be internally unstable. This is a problem when the finer portion of the filter can pass through the coarse portion with water flow; washing the finer portion out and leaving a very coars e soil matrix that will not s erve as a filter for the bas e 148 Chapter 6\u2014F ilter Zones soil. This can be checked by mathematically dividing the gr ain-size cur ve into two gr adations . If the coar se gradation does not meet the f ilter requirements for the fine gradation, the filter is internally uns table (ASDSO, 2003). Avoid placement of filter mater ials in freezing temper atures. Frozen f ilter material cannot be properly compacted. Recently, an additional method has been pr oposed that expands on the exis ting research on protective filters . The method (Fos ter and Fell, 2001, pp. 398-407) establishes a \"continuing erosion boundary\" that is based on the analysis of the results of laboratory tests and the characteristics of dams that have experienced internal erosion incidents . The method can be us ed to deter mine whether filters that ar e coars er than required by modern filter criteria will eventually s eal, or experience continuing erosion leading to possible failure of the embankment dam in the event that internal erosion begins. The method is intended to help evaluate filters in existing embankment dams only and should not be used to design new filters for dams. 6.7 Construction of the filter Construction of the filter should be performed carefully to ensure that high quality is obtained. The cons truction needs to ens ure that the f ilter is placed completely around the conduit. Sloppy placement techniques can result in voids in the filter or inadequate bond with the conduit encasement. Placement of the s and filter and adjacent mater ials in the embankment mus t be performed to avoid contamination of the filter. During construction, the sand filter zone should be maintained above adjacent materials to preclude contamination. Construction traffic crossings over filter zones should be minimized. The surface of the filter at the cr ossing can be cover ed with plas tic and the plas tic cover ed with earthfill to reduce contamination at the cros sing. Placement techniques should ens ure that s egregation of the f ilter does not occur . Segregation will caus e portions of the filter to be overly coars e, which can allow embankment material to flow through, negating the purpose of the filter. Segregation can be avoided by careful selection of the handling equipment. The following has been adapted from R eclamation's Embankment Dams\u2014Protective Filters (1999, p. 16). A common cause of seg regation is the m anner in which material is handled. Material placed in a pile off a conveyor, or loaded from a chute, or from a hopper segregates because the la rger pa rticles roll to the si de of stockpi les or pi les wi thin the ha uling unit. Material dumped from a truck, fr om loader, or other placing equipment wi ll almost always seg regate, with the sev erity of the seg regation cor respondi ng to the height of the drop. When m aterial is dumped on the fi ll, seg regation occurs. 149 Conduits through Embankment Dams Segrega tion can be m inimized in severa l ways. First, the desi gner should a void using widely g raded filters tha t are more prone to seg regation. Rather than using a single, widely g raded filter, a designer could speci fy a dual band of fi lters. A fine filter la yer to protect the fi ner embankment materials would be outletted i nto a coarser layer used to outlet the collected flow . Secondly, constr uction techni ques to contr ol segregation should be fied and enforced. Use of rock la dder, sprea der box es, and tremies or \"elepha nt trunks\" for loading hauling units, and hand wor king the placed materials will help prevent seg regation. If material is dumped, li miting the height of dr op wi ll help. Often the hei ght of dr op is limited to 4 feet m aximum. Placing filter/drain material with belly dum ps is a better method tha n other s beca use the hei ght of dr op of m aterials is limited by the equi pment. Limiting the w idth of the belly dum p openi ng by cha ining or other means can increase thei r ability to li mit segrega tion. Using baffles i n sprea der box es and other pla cing equi pment ca n help reduce seg regation. i nspecti ng the fi lter/dra in producti on, pla cement, and com paction should be tra ined in the techni ques effecti ve in preventi ng segregation. They should be aware of contract provisions in specifications that are intended to prevent seg regation and be prepa red to enforce those speci fications. Filter zones must be compacted properly to avoid problems. Vibratory compactors (usually smooth drum or plate), are more efficient in densifying filters than \"kneading\" compactors (such as sheepsfoot or padfoot), without causing much breakdown. Breakdown of the filter material's particles can cause the gradation of filters to change. The mos t harmful result of breakdown is the incr ease in the percentage of fines (usually defined as the material passing the No. 200 sieve size). Exces sive fines in the material will permeability ilter's attributes . Over compaction s hould be avoided. Often the gr adation of the f ilter is specified as \"in-place, af ter compaction,\" thus ensuring that the intended gradation is obtained. Also, specifying filter material that is comprised of hard and durable particles is important in helping minimize breakdown. Previous sections have dis cussed factors that can af fect the integr ity and quality of the filter diaphragm or collar around a conduit. A paper by Hammer (2003) contains valuable additional guidance on constructing drain zones within embankment dams. Recommendations in that paper include other factors in addition to those discussed in previous sections of this document. Recommendations are included for methods to avoid contamination of filter zones, advantages and disadvantages of various schemes for constructing vertical drainage zones, and others. The recommendations in that paper should also be considered when constructing filter collars and diaphragms associated with conduits, as well as when constructing other types of embankment drainage zones. 150 Chapter 6\u2014F ilter Zones 6.8 Specifications and dens ity quality control and quality as surance for filters and drains Contract specifications contain requirements for compacting sand for filters. Quality control personnel are responsible for ensuring that the specifications are met. Quality assurance personnel then ensure that the quality control methods and equipment a re satisfactory. Filters are compacted using two principal types of specifications. Compaction of sands is important for filter construction. Controlled compaction of the filter sands is important to prevent settlement of the sands on wetting and liquefaction during seismic activity. At the s ame time, f ilters should not be over ly compacted becaus e that can reduce their ability to \"s elf-heal\" or adjus t to any movements in the underlying embankment and foundation. The two types of specifications used for controlling compaction of s ands and gravels are: Method placement sp ecifica tion.\u2014A method placement s pecification r equires the filter s and to be compacted in lifts of a s tated maximum thicknes s using specified equipment oper ated in a s pecified manner . The specification as sumes that the des igner has previous favorable exper ience with a s pecified method and feels sure that the filter s and will have adequate properties , if it is compacted using thes e procedur es. This type of specification does not r equire a specific density or water content, but r elies on the s pecified pr ocedur e to pr oduce desirable filter. Quality contr ol and quality as surance f or this type of specification concentr ate on observations and documentation of the processes used to place the filter, compar ed to the acceptable methods listed in the s pecifications . An example of a method placement specification is shown in the NR CS's Drainfill , National Engineering Handbook, Part 642, Specification No. 24 (2001f, p. 24-2). Class I compaction requires each layer of drainfill to be compacted \". . . by a minimum of two pas ses over the entir e surface with a steel-drum vibrating roller weighing at leas t 5 tons and exerting a vertical vibrating force of not less than 20,000 pounds at a minimum frequency of 1,200 times per minute, or by an approved equivalent method.\" For filters, using smaller compaction equipment, s uch as walk- behind vibr atory rollers and plate compactors , may be required if working s pace is limited. Test fills can be performed in advance of cons truction to check on the adequacy of method type placements. 151 Conduits through Embankment Dams Construction specifications typically also include other requirements. Examples from the NRCS's Drainfill , National Engineering Handbook, , p. 24- 1) include: Drainfill sha ll be pla ced uni formly in layers not to ex ceed 12 i nches thi ck befor e compaction. When paction is accom plished by m anually contr olled equipment, the la yers sha ll not ex ceed 8 i nches thi ck. The m aterial shall be placed to avoid segregation of particle sizes and to ensure the continuity and integrity of a ll zones. No for eign material shall be a llowed to becom e intermixe d with or otherwise contaminate the drainfill. Traffic sha ll not be perm itted to cross over dra ins at random . Equipment cross-overs sha ll be m aintained, a nd the num ber a nd location of such cro ssovers shall be esta blished a nd approved before the begi nning of dra infill pla cement. Each crossover shall be cleaned of all contaminating mat erial and shall be inspected a nd approved by the eng ineer before the pla cement of a dditional drainfill material. Any damage to the founda tion surface or the tr ench si des or bottom occur ring during pla cement of dra infill sha ll be repa ired before dra infill pla cement is continued. The surface of dr ainfill constr ucted concur rently wi th adjacent zones of ll be m aintained at a minimum eleva tion of 1 foot a bove the upper surface of adjacent earthfill. When placed, drainfill shall be in a we t or near saturated condition. Each layer of dra infill sha ll be sa turated immediately pri or to com paction. Drainfill shall be placed in such a man ner as to prevent segregation of particle sizes. Application of water in front of the vibratory roller drum during compaction is crucial. The inability to achieve the des ired dens ity is typically due to insufficient water application. End result sp ecifica tion.\u2014An end r esult specification r equires the f ilter sand to be compacted to a s pecified value of dry dens ity. Usually, the r equired dens ity is specified by r eference to a s tandar d test. The traditional method f or specifying filter sand compaction uses relative density terminology and tests. ASTM D 4254 des cribes the tes t used to meas ure the minimum index dens ity of a filter sand; ASTM D 4 253 describes the test for ma ximum i ndex density of a sand. NRCS's Drainfill , National Engineering Handbook, Part 642, Specification No. 24 (2001f, p. 24-2) s hows an example of an end res ult specification. Class A compaction requires each layer of drainfill to be compacted \". . . to a relative density of not less than 70 percent as determined by ASTM D 4254.\" 152 Chapter 6\u2014F ilter Zones Various degrees of compaction have been historically used. Relative density specifications have typically r equired placement to r elative dens ity values in the range of 50 to 85 per cent. Values for specified relative dens ity may be as low as 50 per cent f or low hazar d projects , to as high as 85 per cent f or larger drain zones in high hazard projects. Relative density specification may not be practical f or small pr ojects , becaus e the equipment needed to per form the tes ts for index dens ity are not readily available for field us e. An alternative to using relative density tests is a special type of Standard Proctor (ASTM D 698) compaction test. Research (McCook, 1996) has shown that good cor relations exist between r elative dens ity tes t values for filter sands and a dry dens ity value obtained us ing dry s and in a AST M D 698 mold. The one-point test uses the ASTM D 698 (Method A) energy (25 blows per lift of a 5.5-pound hammer dropped 12 inches , using 3 lifts to fill the mold). For many sands, 70-percent relative density corresponds to the dry density obtained in the special ASTM D 698 test on dry sand. A value of 50 percent relative density correlates with 95 per cent of the dr y dens ity obtained in the s pecial AST M D 698 tes t. An example of a specification us ing this alter native is NRCS's Drainfill , National Engineering Handbook, Part 642, Specification No. 24 (2001f, p. 24-2) : The com pacted densi ty sha ll be g reater than 95 per cent of the m aximum dry density as determined by the m ethod in ASTM D 698. The ASTM test procedure D 698 s hall be modified to cons ist of a 1-point test performed on a representa tive sa mple of oven-dri ed dra infill. When an end r esult type of specification is used to contr ol the placement of filters in drainage and filter zones, such as a filter diaphragm, quality control testing is required to ver ify that the placed s and meets the s pecified requirements . Accur acy of the quality contr ol testing is essential to pr event misunderstanding of the in- place dens ity. Quality contr ol tests that underes timate in-place dens ity will lead to additional compaction in order to achieve the s pecified dens ity. This additional compaction can lead to additional breakdown of the filter material. Quality control tests of compacted sands are performed most frequently using one of the following two methods: Sand cone method .\u2014AST M D 1556. Nuclea r gauge m ethod.\u2014ASTM D 2922. Note tha t a sepa rate ASTM Standard Test Method a pplies to mea suring the wa ter content by the nuclear gauge, ASTM D 3 017. The ASTM S tandard Te st Me thods for performing nuclear gauge meas urements of dry unit weight and water content are being revis ed. The propos ed revis ion will combine the two test me thods i nto a single ASTM S tandard Te st Me thod. At the time of 153 Conduits through Embankment Dams the writing of this guidance document, an AST M Standard T est Method number had not been assigned for the revised standard. The sand cone method is a dir ect meas urement of in-place dens ity (weight of solids, wet of water , and volume), wher eas the nuclear method is an indir ect measurement technique (measurement of backscatter radiation from a prescribed s ource). By definition, indir ect meas urement techniques require some form of conversion or empirical relationship. Knowledge and use of these relationships should be well understood by the user to guard against drawing incorrect conclusions on the nature of the material being tested. To obta in accurate results, these tests must be performe d carefully with all the precautions listed in the AST M Test Methods carefully followed. Nuclear tests that are performed in a trench condition require that corrections to the meas urements be made accor ding to the gauge manuf recommendations . Becaus e the nuclear gauge content counting hydr ogen ions , water content meas urements must also be corrected by compar ing readings to the oven- dry method (AST M D 2216). Careful calibration of the sand used in the sand cone method is important to obtaining reliable results. Experienced personnel are essential to obtain reliable results for both tests. The reader is cautioned on two points. First, opinions differ on the acceptability of the tes t procedur es described above. Second, this discussion is only relevant to uniformly graded sand material (filter material). This section does not apply to other soil types, such as broadly graded material containing cobbles. 6.9 Use of geotextiles Due to the lack of long term performance information on the use of geotextiles in embankment dams , it is current pr actice that they ar e not us ed in locations that ar e both critical to dam safety and inaccessible for repair. The use of geotextiles can be considered in s ome cas es that may be cr itical to dam s afety, but the geotextiles must be acces sible for replacement. The des igner must assess the potential hazar d posed by failure of the geotextile and the time available to respond and repair or replacement the geotextile (F rance, 2000, p. 2- 5). Some limitations to evaluate when cons idering the us e of geotextiles (ASDSO, 2003): As with any filter, a geotextile will clog when water containing s oil in suspension enter s the f ilter face. 154 Chapter 6\u2014F ilter Zones For preventing development of a concentrated leak in a crack or opening in the embankment dam, it is desirable for the f ilter face to clog in the ar ea of the crack. Other areas should remain open so normal seepage through pores of the soil can be intercepted and safely discharged through the drainage system. Properly designed sand filters support the soil discharge face and prevent the movement of fines that would clog the filter. Geotextiles by themselves do not support the soil discharge face as a granular filter does . Geotextile installation must be made in such a way that the geotextile has intimate contact with the s oil discharge face, with the dis tance between contact points being s imilar to a granular filter; if not, s oil movement will occur and clog the geotextile. A coars e granular fill or a geocompos ite on the downs tream s ide of the geotextile generally does not provide the needed uniform pressure on the geotextile to provide the needed support to the soil discharge face on the upstream side of the geotextile. Inside the embankment dam, geotextiles will have very large s oil pres sures on both s ides of the geotextile that will hold it firmly in place with no chance to distribute stresses that are produced by differential movement within the soil mass along the plane of the geotextile. When a crack occurs in the embankment dam, it will likely tear the geotextile in the plane of the cr ack. Damage can occur during geotextile installation from equipment passing over it, from protrusions in the underlying material, or from moving sheets of the geotextile over a rough s urface. The damage may not always be detectable. The structural integrity of the embankment dam depends on complete continuity of the filter drainage zone, and when constructed with a geotextile, it must be without holes, tears, or defects. This is difficult to achieve in a typical construction operation. 155Conduits through Embankment Dams 156 Chapter 7 Potential Failure Modes Associated with Conduits Water flowing thr ough conduits can es cape thr ough def ects in the walls or between separated joints of the conduit. Soils can also be carried into a conduit through these defects. If a conduit is flowing under pressure and water is forced out of defects within the conduit, this can lead to a very serious problem that must be addressed by emergency action, since catastrophic embankment dam failure could result. If a conduit is not f lowing under pressure, defects within the conduit may allow s oils surrounding it to be carried into the conduit by seepage and hydraulic fracture. Water es caping through defects from within nonpres surized conduits will probably have a lower velocity and lower pressure and should be less damaging to the surrounding s oils, than if the conduit wer e pressurized. This may allow f or remedial measures to be undertaken in less of an emergency mode. Generally, defects in conduits are much more serious for conduits designed for pressure flow than for nonpressurized flow. Attempting to place a f ilter on the outs ide of a conduit at a def ect is likely to be ineffective, particularly for a pressurized conduit. The quantity of flow from the defect in a pr essurized conduit will likely exceed the capacity of a filter designed to protect adjacent soils. In a nonpressurized conduit, the filter designed for a given size def ect may be inadequate when the def ect incr eases in size. Replacing or renovating conduits with defects are the only reliable long term solution to preventing damage to surrounding soils. See chapters 12 and 13 for guidance on replacement and renovation of conduits. Water flowing through soils surrounding a conduit may also cause failure of the embankment dam. A conduit within an embankment dam is a discontinuity that may create stresses in surrounding soils that are conducive to hydraulic fracture. A conduit may impede uniform compaction of soils in its vicinity. The various ways embankment dams may fail (where conduits are the sole or primary contribution to the failure) are discussed in this chapter. Many other types of failure modes for embankment dams exist that ar e not as sociated with conduits and ar e outs ide the scope of this document. 157 Conduits through Embankment Dams The important factors that determine the timing and severity of problems related to soil movement as sociated with conduit def ects include: Type of material used in construction of the conduit .\u2014Some materials, such as corrugated metal, can corrode and develop defects much sooner than conduits constructed of more durable materials, such as concrete. Conduits overlain by high earthfills are more likely to be s tressed beyond their s trength, res ulting in the development of cracks. Dime nsions of the crack or hole, in relation to the gradatio n of the surrounding backfill soil.\u2014Even small defects in conduits can result in movement of finely graded surrounding soils into the conduit. Resistance of the surround ing backfill to interna l erosion a nd backward erosion piping .\u2014Very fine sands and silts are extremely prone to particle movement from intergranular flow of water into defects in conduits . All soils will erode, if subjected to s ufficient concentr ated f low, s uch as might occur in cr acks in the earthfill, but plas tic clays and clayey coar se-grained s oils that ar e not dis persive resist erosive forces better than silts and cohesionless coarse-grained soils. Cracks in surrounding soil connected to water sources .\u2014If cracks in surrounding soil connect to water sources, erosion of the cr ack walls can incr ease dramatically and lead to catastrophic failure of the embankment dam. This can occur for erosion of materials into the conduit or along the conduit. Existence of d ifferentia l head.\u2014The potential for internal erosion or backward erosion piping is directly related to the differential head causing the flow of water , whether the f low is inter granular seepage or flow thr ough cr acks in the soil. High gradients increase the likelihood of internal erosion or backward erosion piping. Even if the head in the reservoir is not high, continued flow through cr acks in the s oil surrounding the conduit is likely to r esult in exces sive erosion of the soil. Type of flow .\u2014Conduits flowing under pressure are more likely to develop problems associated with conduit defects than nonpressurized conduits. The consequences of the problems that develop related to defects will be greater in pressurized conduits than thos e associated with def ects in conduits that ar e not pressurized. Backfill able to suppo rt a tunnel .\u2014Water escaping from defects in a conduit may erode s urrounding s oils. The ability of the s oils to support a tunnel will determine the type of problem that develops. Backward erosion piping requires soil to be present that can support a tunnel feature. Otherwise, sinkholes or other types of features may be more likely to be the expression of the erosion. 158 Chapter 7\u2014Potential F ailure Modes Associated with Conduits There are four main potential failure modes involving conduits through embankment dams . These failure modes are discussed in the f ollowing s ections . 7.1 Failure M ode No. 1 : Backward eros ion piping or internal eros ion of s oils into a nonpres surized conduit For this failure mode, the conduit is surrounded over at least part of its length by soil with a low resistance to backward erosion piping. If the conduit develops a defect from deterioration, or a joint in the conduit becomes open from movement and seepage is occur ring thr ough the s urrounding embankment, s eepage f orces may car ry soil particles into the conduit. For this failure mode, the conduit is presumed to have an inter ior pressure lower than the s eepage pr essures in the s urrounding s oil. Figures 96, 97, and 98 s how conduits with def ects wher e water is enter ing the conduit. In figures 96 and 97, the defects are separated joints in a conduit. In figure 98, the defect is a poorly constructed joint in a CMP. If the soil surrounding the conduit defect is resistant to backward erosion piping and the defect in the conduit is small, the time for serious erosion of surrounding soils to develop could be lengthy. Inspections of the conduit should disclose the presence of defects and allow for timely repair before serious problems develop. However, if the reservoir head is high and the defect in the conduit is large enough, the potential for either backward erosion piping or internal erosion is significant. Backward erosion Figure 96 .\u2014Leaking joints in a 60-inch diameter RCP spillway. Several large vo ids were al so observed in the adjac ent earthfill on the upstrea m slope. 159 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 97 .\u2014Soil particles being carried into an outlet works condui t through a joint.

If the def ect is large enough and the r eservoir head is high enough, the loss of particles from the surrounding soil body caused by backward erosion piping could be severe. 160 Chapter 7\u2014Potential F ailure Modes Associated with Conduits Internal erosion could occur if a preferential f low path (like a hydr aulic f ractur e) develops that is connected to the conduit def ect. If inter nal erosion occur s in soils surrounding a conduit defect in this failure mode, the potential for eventual failure is high, becaus e all s oils when s ubjected to continued f low along a pr eferential f low path are erosive over time. Highly erodible soils, such as nonplastic silts, broadly graded s ilty coar se-grained s oils, and dis persive clays , could develop er osion features more quickly. The mos t likely manifes tation of eros ion in this failure mode is a sinkhole that develops on the embankment surface. As previous ly dis cussed, Failure Mode No. 1 may involve either a backwar d erosion piping or internal erosion mechanism of particle erosion. The Introduction of this document includes extensive discussions of factors that should be evaluated to deter mine which of these mechanis ms is likely f or a specific situation. The sequence in which this failure mode could develop is illustrated in figure 99 and described in the f ollowing s teps. Note that the f ollowing des cription s pecifically involves the development of backward erosion piping in a situation where the conduit is surrounded by s oils susceptible to this failure mechanis m. A similar s et of steps could be des cribed for a s cenario involving internal eros ion rather than backwar d erosion piping, when the s urrounding s oils are not s usceptible to backwar d erosion piping. For the sake of brevity, this description of similar steps in an internal erosion scenario is not repeated. 1. As water is impounded in the reservoir, seepage develops through the embankment dam. The time for this to occur varies with the permeability of the embankment zones . A phr eatic line develops , and s eepage f orces are active in the sa turated soils a round the conduit. 2. Seepage can enter any def ects in the conduit, if the conduit has an inter ior pressure lower than the water in the s oil por es. If the s eepage dis charging into the nonpressurized conduit has sufficient gradient and soils are susceptible to backwar d erosion piping, s oil par ticles may be car ried with the water . 3. Backward eros ion piping of the s oils in the embankment dam will caus e a tunnel to develop for soils that can support a tunnel. If the soils cannot support a tunnel, a sinkhole may occur instead. A failure can occur if the defect in the conduit is large enough to allow mos t of the r eservoir water to es cape. 4. If soils between the r eservoir and the def ect in the conduit ar e not s usceptible to backward erosion piping, and no preferential flow paths occur in the surrounding soils, the defect in the conduit may not result in immediate problems. 161 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 99 .\u2014Failure Mode No. 1 .\u2014Bac kward ero sion pipin g or internal erosion of soi ls surrounding a defect i n a nonpr essurized condui t. 5. If a preferential flow path develops in the soils surrounding the defect in the conduit, such as a hydraulic fracture in the surrounding soils, then internal erosion will occur as water from the res ervoir flows along the crack or other preferential f low path to the def ect in the conduit. 6. The extent of the eros ion that will occur depends on the velocity of the flow, the er osion resistance of the s urrounding s oil, the s ize of the pr eferential f low path, and the size of the defect in the conduit. The erosion that develops from internal erosion from a preferential flow path may have a similar appearance to that from backward erosion piping. 162 Chapter 7\u2014Potential F ailure Modes Associated with Conduits 7. If the tunnel continues to develop f rom inter nal erosion and pr oceeds backwar ds until it r eaches the r eservoir, and the def ect in the conduit is large enough, a breaching type of failure can occur. If the tunnel erosion does not progres s completely until it reaches the res ervoir, a complete breaching failure may not occur, but sinkholes may develop that must be repaired. The Introduction of this document includes extensive discussions of factors that should be evaluated to determine whether internal erosion or backward erosion piping is the cor rect ter m to des cribe the mechanis m of failure. This type of failure mode was in progress at Tin Cup Dam (Luehring, Bezanson, and Grant, 1999). Numerous sinkholes developed in an embankment dam, when a masonry tunnel developed def ects and the s oils adjacent to the conduit wer e eroded into the conduit. Later, a fter the conduit wa s repa ired, a dditiona l problems developed, as described under Failure Mode No. 2. This type of failure mode can also occur where conduits have misaligned joints or irregular ities in their walls . Joint of fsets can caus e high negative pr essures to develop at over hangs during high velocity f low within the conduit. These offsets can cr eate negative pr essures at the of fset from a Ventur i effect. The negative pr essures can pull or \"suck\" surrounding soils into the conduit through the opening, and voids can develop next to the conduit. Continued loss of surrounding soil could lead to development of a sinkhole, which, if it wer e to connect with the r eservoir, could lead to serious consequences and eventually a disastrous failure of the embankment dam. Theoretically, this failure mechanis m would develop as follows : 1. High velocity flow in a conduit with an joint offset or other irregularity in the walls caus es a negative pr essure to develop downs tream of the of fset or defect. 2. If a defect in the conduit wall or a joint that has separated occurs near the point of high negative pressure, the soil surrounding the conduit could be pulled into the conduit from the negative pressures, even though the conduit is flowing unde r pressure . 3. Continued removal of soil near the defect could result in a sinkhole, if it were allowed to continue and could even pr ogress to connect to the r eservoir or embankment surface. This failure mechanis m is less likely than the one where water under pos itive pressure is forced thr ough the def ect in the conduit and damages the s urrounding soil (Failure Mode No. 2). 163Conduits through Embankment Dams 7.1.1 Des ign meas ures to prevent failure Preventing this type of failure requires conduits to be properly designed and constructed with dur able mater ials that ar e unlikely to develop def ects. Chapter 2 discusses important design considerations for conduit materials. CMP's are particula rly susceptible to this type of fa ilure. Joints in a rticula ted conduits must be designed to a ccommoda te movement to tolera ble limits to a void sepa ration of the joints . Once soil around the conduit begins to move into a defect in a conduit, either from backward erosion piping or internal erosion, a serious problem exists. Quick action is usually advisable. Sinkholes can develop, and if the defect is large enough, perhaps an embankment dam breach could even develop. The only reliable long term solutions to preventing a failure or accident associated with this failure mode are to repair the defect in the conduit or renovate or replace the damaged section(s) of conduit. Short term remedial measures like grouting seldom are adequate to completely s top the s eepage from moving the s oil particles . Several options for addressing the def ect in the conduit ar e available, including: Sliplining the conduit Removal and r eplacement of the conduit Repair of the conduit Chapters 12, 13, and 14 have more extensive discussion on methods for renovation, removal and replacement, and repair of conduits. Once a def ect develops in a conduit, quick action is needed to pr event s erious erosion of the surrounding soils. At Tin Cup Dam, an emergency repair involving sliplining a deteriorated 2- by 3-foot outlet works conduit (masonry pipe) with a 16-inch diameter HDPE pipe was implemented to address sinkholes that had formed above it (Luehring, Bezanson, and Grant 1999, p. 3). The annulus space between the HDP E slipliner and the mas onry pipe was grouted, but the gr out was later found to ha ve floa ted the HDPE conduit, a nd sufficient grout wa s not injected to fill the annulus space completely. Later ins pections showed that cavities were present next to joints in the mas onry pipe that were not filled during the grout operations. Additional seepage problems became apparent soon after the repair. Cons equently, extens ive additional r epairs were required the next year . This example illustrates how emergency repairs may avert an immediate threat, but may not be a suitable long term s olution. This also illustrates that problems perceived to be associated with a conduit may have additional caus es. In the f inal repair of the embankment dam, evidence was found of construction problems, including use of materials containing roots and other debris. Other poor construction practices and 164 Chapter 7\u2014Potential F ailure Modes Associated with Conduits mater ial incompatibility between por tions of the embankment and coar se rock fill zones also contributed to problems at the site. 7.2 Failure M ode No. 2: Backward eros ion piping or internal eros ion of s oils by flow from a pres surized conduit When the conduit is flowing under pressure, the pr essure in the conduit can exceed the pr essure outs ide the conduit. If there are def ects in the conduit, the high pressure flow can exit the conduit thr ough the def ects. The water flowing under pressure begins to exert hydraulic forces on the embankment soils. This could also occur, if a portion of the conduit has collapsed or articulated conduits separate at a joint. Water flowing in the conduit could then flow outwa rd into the surrounding embankment through the defect in the conduit. Conduits may collapse from deterioration, poor design and construction, and other causes, as discussed in chapter 8. If the conduit wer e to become blocked by debr is, the inter nal pressure in the conduit could be much higher than the nor mal pr essure at design flow. A conduit designed to flow without pressure may then become pressurized. Designers should cons ider this possibility. Separation of articulated conduits is discussed in section 4.3.1. The sequence of failure is described as follows and is illustrated in figure 100. 1. Water flowing out of the pressurized conduit begins seeping through the embankment dam and emer ges at some exit f ace. The exit f ace may be the downs tream toe, a downs tream shell zone compos ed of very coar se gradation, or another seepage exit f ace. If the s eepage f ace is unpr otected by a pr operly designed f ilter, particles can be dis lodged by the s eepage water . 2. Seepage f orces detach s oil par ticles from the exit f ace, and backwar d erosion piping occur s if the s oils are susceptible to this mechanis m of failure and able to support a tunnel roof. 3. Backward erosion piping progresses backwards until a tunnel connecting the defect in the conduit and the exit f ace forms. If this backwar d erosion piping continues, it can lead to a failure of the embankment dam. 4. If the soils surrounding the conduit are resistant to backward erosion piping, the def ect in the conduit is small, and the hydr aulic f orce of water in the conduit is low, no immediate problems may occur. Soils not susceptible to backward erosion piping require a concentrated flow path for significant erosion to occur. 165 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 100.\u2014Failure Mode No. 2 .\u2014Bac kward ero sion pipin g or internal erosion of soils surro unding a pressuri zed conduit with a defect. 5. If soils surrounding the conduit develop a preferential flow path, such as a hydraulic fracture, and the internal conduit pres sure is large enough, internal erosion may occur, rather than backward erosion piping. The hydraulic fracture created can erode and lead to development of a failure tunnel that is similar to that which develops in soils that are susceptible to backward erosion piping. If the erosion process continues, it can lead to a breaching failure of the embankment dam. As previous ly dis cussed, Failure Mode No. 2 may involve either a backwar d erosion piping or internal erosion mechanism of particle erosion. The Introduction of this document includes extensive discussions of factors that should be evaluated to deter mine which of these mechanis ms is likely f or a specific situation. An example of this failure mode is the breach of Lawn Lake Dam near Estes Park, Colorado, discussed in more detail in appendix B. A defective seam in the 166 Chapter 7\u2014Potential F ailure Modes Associated with Conduits connection between a conduit and valve allowed water under pressure to er ode the downstream soils by combination of internal erosion and backward erosion piping, and an embankment dam failure occurred. The failure occurred when lead caulking between the outlet conduit and gate valve deter iorated and allowed water under pressure to er ode the embankment dam. The failure of Lake Tansi Dam (Heckel and Sowers, 1995) was also attributed to this type of failure mode. In some cas es, multiple failure modes may be involved at a s ingle s ite. Tin Cup Dam developed sinkholes associated with Failure Mode No. 1, as described in the previous section, when the mas onry outlet conduit collaps ed. To addr ess these problems, an HDPE pipe was sliplined in the masonry outlet tunnel and the annulus grouted. Additional sinkholes and distress symptoms related to Failure Mode No. 2 occur red when the downs tream contr ol gate that was installed as part of the f irst repair allowed pr essurized f low in the conduit. More extens ive repairs were required to addr ess these second s eries of distress symptoms , including r elocating the contr ol gate back to the upstream side of the embankment dam and placing a downstream buttres s fill (Luehring, B ezanson, and Grant, 1999, p. 7). Failure Mode No. 3, which is discussed in a following section, was probably also active at this site (see Failure Mode No. 3 for further discussion of Tin Cup Dam). 7.2.1 Design measures to prevent failure Design meas ures that eliminate or reduce the pos sibility of a conduit deteriorating and developing a defect that would allow this failure mode include (1) using conduit materials that are resista nt to deteriora tion, (2) ensuring wa tertight joints for pressure flow conduits, and (3) designing conduits to resist cracking from applied loads and foundation movements. Chapters 1 through 6 discuss many of these design measures in more detail. Two general methods might be used to address this type of failure mode once it occur s. They are (1) bar rier cutof fs, and (2) f ilter diaphr agms and collar s. A bar rier cutoff consists of a grouted zone surrounding the conduit or sliplining of the conduit. The grout can be chemical or cementitious grout, depending on the size and s hape of the s uspected voids in the s oil and the natur e of the s oils. For guidance on grouting around conduits, see section 14.1. Rarely would grouting be considered adequate without als o installing an inverted filter over the area where s eepage is occur ring. An inver ted filter is a series of layer ed filters placed on a s oil surface that is discharging s eepage. This filter is designed to filter any s oil particles being discharged with the s eepage and to pr ovide capacity f or releasing the collected water . The layer s usually cons ist of a layer of finer sand placed on the gr ound s urface wher e the seepage is discharging, which is cover ed by a layer of coar ser gravel that is filter compatible with the fine sand. A third layer of small cobbles may overlay the gravel filter. In some cas es, a fourth layer of rip rap size rock may be us ed to ar mor the filters beneath and protect them from damage. When multiple layers of filters are 167 Conduits through Embankment Dams used to backfill a s inkhole, this system of filters may be placed in revers e order, with the coarser gradations placed in the bottom of the sinkhole, and progressively finer filters used to backfill the s inkhole. The intent of this system is to block additional movement of soils above the sinkhole into the feature. Ultimately, no remedial meas ure would be cons idered safe without r epairing the conduit, becaus e the hydraulic heads at the discharge point would be excessive for granular filter/drainage zones to control. Filter diaphragms or collars that are limited in s ize are s eldom s ufficient to control this type of failure. Emergency action consisting of placing an inverted filter with rock cover over the dis charge point of water or the f ace of the embankment dam may be appropriate. Rarely should this type of measure be considered a long term solution. If internal erosion rather than backward erosion piping is the cause of the problem, a f ilter blanket over the dis charge area may become plugged, and f low will seek an alter native exit. 7.3 Failure M ode No. 3: Backward eros ion piping or internal eros ion of s oils along the outs ide of a conduit caus ed by hydraulic forces from the res ervoir For this failure mode, water flows along the inter face between the conduit thr ough an embankment dam and the surrounding soil. This failure mode is usually associated with embankment s eepage thr ough the s oils surrounding the conduit. The seepage along the inter face between the conduit and s urrounding s oil may be concentr ated enough to r esult in backwar d erosion piping, if the s oils are susceptible. This failure mode is very similar to Failure Mode No. 2. The only difference in these two modes of failure is the source of the water. In Failure Mode No. 2, the source of the water caus ing internal eros ion of the s oils is a defect in a conduit. In Failure Mode No. 3, the s ource of the water is seepage f rom the r eservoir that concentr ates at the inter face between the conduits and s urrounding s oil. The sequence of failure is described as follows and is illustrated in figure 101. 1. Seepage f orces and concentr ated f low develop along the contact between a conduit and surrounding soil. 2. Backwar d erosion piping can occur if the s eepage exits downs tream thr ough an unfiltered face or into an over ly coar se zone of the embankment dam and the soils surrounding the conduit are susceptible to backward erosion piping. Continued flow can result in the formation of a tunnel connected to the reservoir that will potentially res ult in a breach of the embankment dam. 3. If soils surrounding the conduit are resistant to backward erosion piping, but cracks or preferential flow paths occur from poor compaction techniques or later develop from hydraulic fracture, continued flow through the preferential 168 Chapter 7\u2014Potential F ailure Modes Associated with Conduits Figure 101.\u2014Failure Mode No. 3 .\u2014Bac kward ero sion pipin g or internal erosion of soi ls along a condui t at the i nterface betw een the condui t and surro unding soils. flow paths will res ult in internal eros ion. An eros ion feature s imilar to that caused by backward erosion piping can then develop. 4. If the erosion process continues, it can lead to a breaching failure of the embankment dam. As previous ly dis cussed, Failure Mode No. 3 may involve either a backwar d erosion piping or internal erosion mechanism of particle erosion. The Introduction of this document includes extensive discussions of factors that should be evaluated to deter mine which of these mechanis ms is likely f or a specific situation. Figures 8 and 9 illus trate failure mechanis ms resulting from internal eros ion along a conduit. The Tin Cup Dam case history described by Luehring, Bezanson, and Grant (1999) is an example where this failure mode probably contributed to the development of extensive sinkholes and other distress symptoms at an embankment dam. As discussed previous ly in this chapter, it s eems likely that multiple failure modes 169 Conduits through Embankment Dams occurred at Tin Cup Dam, and water flowing along the outside of the conduit from the reservoir, Fa ilure Mode No. 3, w as one of the m. Compacting s oil adjacent to a conduit is difficult, and compaction ef forts can dislodge the conduit and cr eate pathways for future concentr ated f low. A cradle is needed, so that soil does not have to be compacted under the haunches of the conduit. This is important to prevent an easy pathway for internal erosion. For guidance on the design and construction of conduits and filters, see chapters 1 through 6. Often, failures of embankment dams related to water flowing through or under the embankment have been near the conduit location. A natural tendency has been to assume that the pathway f or water flow that caus ed the f ailure was directly along the conduit, identified as Failure Mode No. 3. This mode of failure appears most likely when s oil is not compacted pr operly under the haunches of circular conduit, and a continuous zone of poorly compacted soil is subject to the hydraulic head of the reservoir. Examples of this type of failure mode are the Loveton Farms and Medford Quarry Dams Wash Water Lake case histories in appendix B. One of the r easons that antis eep collar s were used in embankment dam des ign was to pr event this mechanis m of failure. The fact that many f ailures occur red even though antis eep collar s were installed cor rectly, and that the collar s could be s een to be intact after the failure caused investigators to consider that at least a portion of the flow path may have been away f rom the inter face between the conduit and surroundi ng soil in some dam failures. Appendix A discusses in detail why antiseep collar s have been dis continued as a primary def ensive des ign element on mos t new embankment dams. Figure 102 shows a conduit with its a ntiseep colla rs inta ct after an interna l erosion failure of the embankment dam. In this case, it appears unlikely that the flow path for the failure was a continuous uninterrupted flow along the conduit, but at least part of the flow path was in the earthfill s urrounding the conduit. In mos t cases, it has not been pos sible to deter mine the exact f low path that water followed in internal erosion failures, becaus e the evidence was destroyed by the f ailure. If hydraulic fracture and other caus es of cracks in compacted backfill were ignored as the potential caus e for failures, one might incor rectly as sume that all f ailures that occur in the vicinity of conduits are attributable to flow along the conduit. In Failure Mode No. 4 (dis cussed in the following s ection), hydraulic fractures occur in the s oil mass beyond the immediate vicinity of the conduit, us ually as sociated with differential s ettlement in the fill caus ed either by the conduit or excavations made to install the conduit, or uneven bedrock profiles near the conduit. Failures of compacted dis persive clay embankment dams , such as thos e exper ienced by the NRCS and documented in Sherard (1972), probably involve Failure Mode 170 Chapter 7\u2014Potential F ailure Modes Associated with Conduits Figure 102.\u2014Condui t with intact antiseepa ge colla rs. The colla rs would have interrupted flow a long condui t. Internal erosion or backwa rd piping erosion likely occur red through hydr aulic fractures in surrounding earthfill, resulting in failure of this embankment dam. No. 4 more often than Failure Mode No. 3, where water is assumed to flow directly along the conduit. The reason for this conclusion is the known high quality of the compaction effort us ed to place low permeability clays around the conduits of thes e structures, plus several eyewitnes s accounts wher e the f low path was known to be as much as 15 feet above and to the s ides of the conduit. The known caus e of thos e failures was hydr aulic f ractur e of the embankment dam, not always immediately in the vicinity of the conduit. 7.3.1 Design measures to prevent failure A filter diaphr agm or collar surrounding the conduit is the cur rently accepted method used to prevent this type of failure mode. Filter diaphragms and collars are discussed in detail in chapter 6. In summary, Failure Mode No. 3 refers to the condition where the predicted flow path for backward erosion piping or internal erosion is directly along the inter face between the conduit and s urrounding ear thfill. Failure Mode No. 4, dis cussed in the f ollowing s ection, cover s situations wher e the pathway for the eros ion of the earthfill is a significant dis tance away from the interface of the conduit and embankment. Filter diaphragms or collars may need to be significantly lar ger to pr otect agains t Failure Mode No. 4 than ar e needed to protect against Failure Mode No. 3. 171 Conduits through Embankment Dams 7.4 Failure M ode No. 4: Internal eros ion of hydraulic fracture cracks in the earthfill above, below, or adjacent to the conduit Conduits are one of the primary causes of differential settlement of an embankment dam that can result in hydraulic fracture of the embankment in the vicinity of the conduit. When an earthfill experiences hydraulic fracture, a pathway is created along which water from the r eservoir can f low eas ily and er ode the s oil in contact with the crack. Failure Mode No. 4 is one where hydraulic fracture of the embankment dam in the vicinity of a conduit is a ttributa ble to the differentia l settlement ca used by the conduit, and f low thr ough the cr ack er odes the embankment to the point wher e a breaching type failure occurs . Hydraulic fracture of earthfill is discussed extens ively in section 5.2. This failure mode differs from Failure Mode No. 3, s ince the s eepage path forms at a location away from the soil-conduit interface. These kinds of failures are mos t common when a res ervoir fills suddenly s hortly after completion of the embankment dam, and the earthfill is highly erodible. The sides of cracks may er ode ver y quickly when water from the r eservoir flows through the crack. The eroded f ailure path can enlar ge to a s ize that can empty a r eservoir rapidly. If a crack is not intercepted with a filter zone, an embankment dam failure can result when the cr ack enlar ges from er osion. Even high plas ticity clays that ar e not dispersive can er ode over time. The sequence of failure for Failure Mode No. 4 is described as follows and is illustrated in figure 103. 1. After a crack forms in the s oils surrounding the conduit, if the embankment soils are highly er odible, the cr ack r apidly enlar ges from er osion of the s idewalls of the cr ack. The water discharging at the downs tream face of the embankment dam is muddy, and a vortex may form at the entry point on the upstre am slope. 2. The erosion tunnel enlarges to the point that the reservoir is emptied and the breaching pr ocess is completed. 3. A tunnel-s haped hole will exis t after the failure, if the eroded tunnel is narrow enough to support the roof of the tunnel. If the tunnel collapses from erosion and widening caus ed by a lack of s upport for the roof, the failure will have the appearance of an open breach in the embankment dam. 4. As previously discussed, Failure Mode No. 4 almost always involves the mechanism of internal erosion, and very rarely can backward erosion piping be correctly attr ibuted as the caus e of such failure. 172 Chapter 7\u2014Potential F ailure Modes Associated with Conduits Figure 103.\u2014Failure Mode No. 4 .\u2014Interna l erosi on of the ea rthfill above and on ei ther si de of a condui t caused by concentra ted flow i n a hydra ulic fracture or other preferential flow path in the com pacted ea rthfill. Hydraulic fracture cracks in the embankment dam may result from differential settlem ent ca used by the pr esence of a condui t within the earthfill. 5. This type of failure occurs mos t frequently on firs t filling of the res ervoir s o that intergranular seepage rarely has had time to develop. One of the requirements for backward erosion piping to be defined in the context of this document is that it res ults from intergranular s eepage, which jus tifies this conclusion. 6. Another reason that backward erosion piping is seldom the cause for failures in the earthfill above a conduit is that mos t embankment dams are not constructed of soils susceptible to backward erosion piping without proper design features to prevent the backward erosion piping. As previously discussed, Failure Mode No. 4 almost always involves the mechanism of internal erosion, and very rarely can backward erosion piping be correctly attributed as the caus e of such failure. This type of failure occur s mos t frequently on first filling of the res ervoir, s o that intergranular s eepage rarely has had time to develop. One of the requirements for backward erosion piping to be defined in the context of this document is that it res ults from intergranular s eepage, which jus tifies this conclusion. Another reason that backward erosion piping is seldom the cause 173 Conduits through Embankment Dams for failures in the earthfill above a conduit is that mos t embankment dams are not constructed of soils susceptible to backward erosion piping without proper design features to pr event the backwar d erosion piping. The Introduction of this document contains extens ive dis cussions of factors that ar e impor tant in dis tinguis hing between internal erosion and backward erosion piping mechanisms of particle erosion. Figure 7 illus trates the s equence in development of Failure Mode 4. Figure 104 shows a small embankment dam that failed by internal erosion. The conduit cr eated dif ferential s ettlement in s oils above the conduit that r esulted in hydraulic f ractur e. The embankment s oils were highly dis persive clays . If the erosion tunnel widens enough, the tunnel can collapse, and a tunnel-shaped failure s urface is not obs erved after the failure. The failure is simply a breach in the embankment dam. The near failure of the USACE's Wister Dam is a good example of this scenar io of internal eros ion. The failure of the embankment dam during firs t filling was narrowly averted by quickly lowering the pool and employing other intervention measures. The embankment dam was constructed of highly dispersive clays without a chimney f ilter. The problems occur red in a clos ure section of the embankment dam. See the Wis ter Dam cas e history in appendix B . Sher ard (1986, p. 911) provides further details on this interesting case history. Another example of internal erosion resulting from the existence of hydraulic fractur e cracks within an embankment dam is the Upper Red Rock Site 20 Dam. See appendix B for a detailed discussion of this case history. Before the NRCS gained an understanding of the behavior of dispersive clay soils, over 15 embankment dams constructed of dispersive clays failed. Most of the failures occurred near the conduits through the embankment dam. The conduits contributed to differentia l settlement, which led to hydra ulic fra cturing (Shera rd, 1972; Sherard, Decker, and R yker, 1972a). Another example of this type of failure is the Anita Dam case history in appendix B. Investigators attributed one possible cause for the formation of a flow path for water to be freezing and thawing of soils adjacent to the conduit. Hydra ulic fra cture could a lso ha ve contributed to the failure. 7.4.1 Design measures to prevent failure Several des ign meas ures are available in preventing this type of failure mode from developing. The first design meas ure involves reducing the potential f or cracking and inter nal erosion of the fill. The mechanis m res pons ible for this type of failure mode is 174 Chapter 7\u2014Potential F ailure Modes Associated with Conduits Figure 104.\u2014Failure of a n embankment da m due to i nterna l erosi on of hydraulic fracture cracks upon first filling of the reservo ir. hydraulic fracture. Hydraulic fracture is discussed in section 5.2. Dispersive clays are the most susceptible to this failure mode, and special attention should be given to testing for the pr esence of dispersive clays in all embankment dams . See s ection 5.3.3 for additional discussion of di spersive clays. The second measure involves constructing a properly designed zone of filter material around the conduit to intercept cracks that develop from hydraulic fracture. Filter diaphragms, filter collars, or embankment chimney filter zones are common design elements . Most high and s ignificant hazard dams will have as part of their des ign a full chimney filter. Low hazard embankment dams constructed of nondispersive soils may only include a filter diaphragm or filter collar. Filter zones are dis cussed in more detail in chapter 6. A third measure to address the potential for internal erosion failures in embankment dams is the us e of additives incorporated into the fill to reduce eros ivity. Lime treatment has been us ed to r educe the er osivity of dispersive clays , but its cost is seldom jus tified, except in cr itical par ts of the f ill, such as the contact between the centr al cor e and bedr ock. The case history on the P iketber g Dam in South Af rica is discussed in appendix B, and it showed that the addition of gypsum to treat the dispersive clays in the cor e of the embankment dam may not have been completely effective. For guidance on s oil amendments , see section 5.3.3. Usually, r elying on a filter zone is cons idered more pos itive than us ing soil amendments . 175 Conduits through Embankment Dams 176 Chapter 8 Potential Defects A ssociated wit h Conduit s Defects associated with conduits can lead to the development of potential f ailure modes. If corrective action is not taken to repair the damage resulting from the defect, this can lead to a failure of the embankment dam. For a further discussion of potential f ailure modes associated with conduits , see chapter 7. For guidance on the renovation, removal and replacement, and repair of conduits, see chapters 12, 13, and 14. Various materials have been used in the construction of conduits, such as concrete, plastic, and metal. Each conduit material reacts differently in embankment dam applications. A search of the USACE's Waterways and Experiment Station damage and repair data base indicated that the most common defect requiring repair in concrete conduits wa s leakage through cra cks and joints (USAC E, 1988, p. 96). This chapter will dis cuss some of the mos t common types of defects associated with conduits. Periodic inspection of the conduit by man-entry or CCTV inspection is the only r eliable method to detect the extent of damage. For guidance on ins pection, see chapter 9. 8.1 Deterioration Often, if deterioration is left unchecked, it will continue and progres sively wors en. If repairs are promptly made, the conduit may be able to continue to function in a serviceable f ashion. However , if deter ioration is allowed to pr ogress, there may come a time when a significant portion of the conduit must be entirely replaced. Action for timely repair may be more cost effective than postponing repairs and eventually having to replace major portions of the conduit. 8.1.1 Abrasion Abrasion in conduits is an erosional process and is a function of velocity and turbulence in the f low, the har dness of the abr asive mater ial, and the quality of the surface experiencing abrasion. Abrasion is caused by water flowing through a conduit at high velocities and containing silts, sands, gravels, or stones (figure 105). 177 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 105.\u2014Abrasio n/erosion damage t o concrete from flowi ng water conta ining sand and silt. This flow caus es a scouring or grinding ef fect on the expos ed surface. Most conduits do not carry significant amounts of abrasive materials in the flow. However, conduits used for diversion during construction or for reservoir sediment release are especially vulner able. Increases in the velocity of the f low can incr ease the abr asive power . In concr ete , abrasive damage has been exper ienced in concr ete with low strength and poor quality aggregates. Abrasive flow usually erodes the cement mortar mix matr ix, leaving an expos ed, polis hed, and coar se aggr egate s urface. As the abrasion process continues, the concrete may be eroded down to the reinforcement. The extent of damage depends on the flow duration and velocity, concrete quality, and compressive strength. In concrete conduits, abrasion is gener ally not a f actor when velocities are less than 15 f t/s. In metal conduits , abrasive flow can er ode pr otective linings and coatings and expos e the s urface to corrosion. Once damage f rom abr asion has begun, it will acceler ate with each oper ation of the conduit, unless the source of the a brasive ma terials is removed. Cavitation ma y also be triggered by the a brasion da mage (by crea ting rity) a nd greatly incr ease the r ate of destruction. Polyethylene plastic pipe has been found to be very abrasion resistant. However, high velocity flow containing abras ive materials can s till be problematic for any type of pipe. 8.1.2 Aging The aging process can also cause deterioration in conduits. In concrete, properties change over time and eventually af fect the integr ity of the s tructure (Pinto, 1994, p. 1111). Both the quality of concr ete (e.g., por osity), and phys ical and chemical f actors influence the rate of concrete deterioration. Processes that can weaken concrete include: 178 Chapter 8\u2014Potential Defects Associated with Conduits Freez ing and thawing.\u2014Repeated cycles of freezing and thawing can af fect the durability of concrete. Concrete readily abs orbs water and is vulnerable to damage, if the water within its system of pores can f reeze and gener ate disruptive pr essures. If the por es existing in the concr ete are inadequate in s ize and number to accommodate the gr eater volume occupied by the ice, the concrete will fracture. The rate of progres sion of the freezing and thawing deter ioration will depend upon the number of cycles , the degr ee of s aturation during freezing, the porosity of the concrete, and the exposure conditions. Concrete experiencing damage by freezing and thawing is characterized by a disintegrated appearance. Deterioration due to freezing and thawing is especially s evere in the nor thern and mountain zones of the United States . Deterioration from freezing and thawing progresses from the exterior surface to the concr ete inwar d. As the concr ete on the s urface fails and is removed by spalling, the depth of freezing progres ses inward (Reclamation, 2003, p. 7). Freezing and thawing typically is not a significant concern for conduits, since most of the conduit is submer ged or has limited expos ure. However , freezing and thawing can become a pr oblem f or entrance and ter minal s tructures. Figure 106 shows a concrete intake structure that has been exposed to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing. In new cons truction, the entr ainment of small bubbles of air into fresh concrete has been found to provide relief for pressures developed by f ree water as it freezes and expands . Repair s to exis ting s tructures require replacement concrete or epoxy-bonded concrete (R eclamation, 1997, p. 26). Figure 106.\u2014Concr ete deter ioration from freezing and tha wing. 179 Conduits through Embankment Dams Alkali-aggregate reaction .\u2014Alkali- aggregate r eaction (AAR) occur s when cer tain types of sa nd and aggrega te (e.g., opa l, chert, flint, or volca nic ma terial with a high s ilica content) are expos ed to s odium and potas sium hydroxide portland cement. In a mois t envir onment, a gel is formed around the r eactive aggregate, cr eating tens ion cr acks around the aggr egate and extens ive expans ion and fracturing of the concrete. This expansion, cracking, and loss of concrete strength can lead to pathways for seepage or localized collaps e of the conduit. Concrete containing alkali-reactive aggregate may show immediate expansion and deterioration, or it may remain undisturbed for many years. Concrete exper iencing AAR is char acterized by patter n cracking on the s urface. Figure 107 shows a concrete wall that has experienced AAR . In new construction, aggregate sources containing negligible potentially alkali-reactive materials , low alkali cements, and pozzolan replacement of a portion of cement, should be used. When abundant potentially alkali-reactive materials are available, low alkali portland cements and f ly ash pozzolan have been f ound to eliminate or greatly reduce the deterioration of reactive aggregates. There is no proven method for eliminating AAR in exis ting s tructures (Reclamation, 1997, p. 6). Sulfate attack .\u2014Sodium, magnes ium, and calcium s ulfates existing in s oils and groundwater s react chemically with the hydr ated lime and hydr ated aluminate in the cement paste in concrete. The volume of the reaction byproducts is greater than the volume of the cement pas te from which they ar e formed, resulting in disruption of the concrete from expansion. Concrete experiencing sulfate attack is characterized by a disintegrated appearance. In new construction, a sulfate resistant por tland cement or a combination of suitable cement and pozzolan s hould be s pecified, when it is recognized that concrete will be exposed to soil and groundwater with sulfates. The application of a thin polymer concrete overlay or sealing compounds may be beneficial for existing structures exper iencing s ulfate attack. Other wise, removal and r eplacement of concr ete with a s ulfate resistant cement s hould be cons idered (Reclamation, 1997, p. 23). Polyethylene plastic pipe, if exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and oxygen, can exper ience degr pr operties of the pipe. Ultraviolet light is present in sunlight. Typical applications using polyethylene pipe involve s liplining of exis ting conduits . In this type of application, expos ure to UV light is limited. Any expos ed surfaces would r equire long ter m UV pr otection. This protection is provided by compounding 2 to 3 percent carbon black into the material, which prevents UV penetration. 8.1.3 Cavitation Cavitation is an erosional process and often causes deterioration in concrete, plastic, and metal conduits with high heads , wher e high velocity vor tices are formed. The 180Chapter 8\u2014Potential Defects Associated with Conduits Figure 107.\u2014Concrete deterioration from alkali-aggregate reaction. risk of cavitation can be evaluated by computing the cavitation index for flow, which is a function of velocity and pressure. Normally, for flow velocities less than 40 ft/s, cavitation will be minimal. Discontinuities or irregularities on flow s urfaces and/or misalignments in conduits carrying high velocity f low can induce cavitation. These discontinuities , irregular ities, or misalignments caus e the f lowing water to separate from the conduit surface, resulting in negative pressure zones and bubbles of water vapor . When thes e bubbles travel downs tream and collaps e next to the conduit surface, the high pressure impact removes small particles of the conduit surface (pitting). As the pitting continues, a progressively deepening cavity develops, which causes additional ir regular ities that leads to even lar ger cavities farther downs tream (also known as a Christmas tree pattern). Cavitation is common just downstream of mechanical contr ol equipment, s uch as gates or valves (figure 108) wher e pressure flow changes to free flow. Damage from cavitation and abrasion can appear to be similar. Cavitation damage appears as a plucking out of the surface material with no fine scale evidence of flow direction. Abrasion damage is normally flow directional. The use of aeration devices (e.g., ramps and/or slots) installed along flow surfaces in moder n structures has been f ound to be an ef fective method f or preventing cavitation damage. All new s tructures should include aer ation devices , and exis ting structures that have exper ienced cavitation damage can be r etrofitted to include these. However , the mos t effective s olution is to eliminate the s ource of the cavitation, ra ther tha n attempting to minimize the resulting da mage. For further guidance on cavitation, s ee Reclamation's Cavitation in Chutes and Spillways (1990a). 181 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 108.\u2014Cavitation da mage to the ca st-iron lining of a condui t imme diately downstream of a slide gate, caused by high velocity flow. 8.1.4 Corrosion of metals Corrosion of metals is a complex phenomenon involving many inherent structural and envir onmental f actors. Cor rosion is commonly a r esult of contact between dissimilar metals , or when metals are in contact with water, mois t earthfill, or the atmosphere. Corrosion affects all types of metal and alloy pipe and reinforcing bars in concrete. Corrosion is the destructive attack on conduit materials by electr ochemical r eaction to the envir onment. Corrosion can als o be des cribed as the process wher eby metals return to their natur al state. Certain metals , such as platinum, gold, s ilver, and copper exis t in nature in a s table metallic s tate. However, other metals require refinement by heating. Unless these refined metals are protected from the environment, they will eventually revert from their temporary refined metallic s tate back to a more natural s tate. The soil and water s urrounding the conduit, and water flowing thr ough the conduit can af fect the r ate of corrosion. The soil and water can contain different types of a cids, alkalis, dissolved salts, organics , indus trial was tes, mine drainage, etc. The rate of corros ion will vary, depending on chemical and physical properties and exposure to the environment. Factors that inf luence cor rosion include (Amer ican I ron and Steel I nstitute, 1994): Soil resistivity .\u2014Corrosion involves the flow of current from one location to another. The ability of s oils surrounding conduits to conduct electrical particles can af fect their tendency to cor rode a conduit. Resistivity is a meas ure of the resistance to current flow of a material, usually expressed in units of ohm-cm. Conduits surrounded by clay s oils with typical res istivity values of 750 to 182 Chapter 8\u2014Potential Defects Associated with Conduits 2,000 ohm/cm will be more likely to corrode than conduits surrounded by sands that typically have res istance values of 30,000 to 50,000 ohm/cm. Acidity (pH) .\u2014Mos t soils fall into a pH range of 6 to 8, which is neutral. Water and s oils with lower pH values are acidic and can res ult in a more corros ive envir onment. Moisture content .\u2014Soils that drain rapidly are less corrosive than soils that tend to hold water longer . Soils with high clay content ar e typically mor e corrosive than sandy soils. Solub le salts.\u2014Salts that become ionized can decr ease the r esistivity of a soil. Oxygen content.\u2014Increasing levels of dissolved oxygen can acceler ate cor rosion. The process of corrosion can pr oceed either uniformly or in pitting of the s urface. Uniform cor rosion is wher e cor rosion occur s evenly over the s urface, r esulting in a low rate of corrosion. Pitting corrosion is not uniform and is focused only on a small surface area, res ulting in a high rate of corros ion, until a perforation eventually develops. Pitting can begin on surface imperfections, scratches, or surface deposits. Between pH 5 and 9, pitting is likely to occur , if no pr otective f ilm is present. In the pas t, CM P has been a commonly us ed mater ial for conduits through embankment dams. Thousands of embankment dams in the United States and all over the wor ld have CM P conduits installed in them. Corrosion is a common problem with CMP conduits (figure 109). Many State highway departments have made extens ive studies on the us e and durability of CMP for culverts under highway embankments. However, available information on the use of CMP for conduits through embankment dams is limited. A study of 50 existing CMP conduits in water shed dams located in the M idwes tern United States was done in 1989 (Koelliker and Lin, 1990). The study determined that the es timated average life of the sampled CM P conduits was 43 year s, but the lif espan r anged f rom 24 to 72 year s. This study also found tha t leakage and associated corrosion at pipe joints was most often the primary limiting as pect of life expectancy. Many s pillway conduit s ystems constructed with CM P exper ience cor rosion at the joint connection between the conduit section and the riser (the vertical pipe or inlet that connects to the outlet pipe). Spillway ris ers are s ubject to deformation and movement (tilting) caus ed by ice loadings or erosion, which can open the joint connection with the outlet pipe. The riser itself is also susc eptible to corrosion. The mos t susceptible por tion of a CM P to cor rosion is the inver t, since it is expos ed to the flow of wa ter for the longest length of time. CMPs tha t have inverts with sa gs could tr ap water and f urther increase the potential f or corrosion. Corrosion of 183 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 109.\u2014Corrosion has completely destr oyed thi s CMP spi llway condui t. Backfill materials that surrounded the condui t have been eroded by flow wi thin the condui t. CMPs generally consists of two types: soil side or water side. Most metal loss associated with cor rosion occur s on the inter ior or water side of the pipe. Soil s ide corrosion is not us ually a s ignificant f actor in conduit lif e. In the pr esence of oxygen and water , metal cor rodes through an oxidative pr ocess that involves the f ormation and releas e of metallic ions . The water acts as an electrolyte to carry thes e ions , which f orm the bas is for the cor rosion of the CM P. The reaction of the metal with the dis solved oxygen in the water caus es the deter ioration mos t visible on the water side of the conduit (Federal Highway Administration [FHWA], 1991, p. 4). CMPs are subject to electr olytic cor rosion due to galvanic action between the metal and the surrounding soil, groundwater, and water flowing through the conduit (Kula, Zamensky, and King, 2000, p. 2). The galvanic action results in corrosion of the CMP and a gr adual decr ease in wall thicknes s and s tructural integr ity. Over time, corros ion of the CMP will res ult in the reduction of wall thicknes s, formation of pipe perforations , and the eventual collaps e of the CM P. The service life of the CMP is affected by its metallic makeup, coatings , linings , pH and res istivity of the backfill and water, mois ture content of the backfill, and abrasion from material particles in the flow. Pipe manufacturers have applied coatings and linings to CM P to mitigate cor rosion and extend the s ervice lif e. CMP coatings have included metallic coatings (zinc [galvanized] and aluminum), and nonmetallic coatings (bituminous [asphalt], cement, and polymers ). CMP linings have included asphalt and concrete. The natural scaling tendencies inherent in some waters provide additional protection. Scaling is the deposit and adherence of insoluble products on the surface of the CMP, which isolate it from the water and protect it f rom cor rosion. The factor that mos t affects corrosion and s cale 184 Chapter 8\u2014Potential Defects Associated with Conduits formation in the CM P are the chemicals dissolved in or transported by the natur al water. All coatings and linings have s ome minor flaws (holidays ). Corros ion tends to concentr ate at thes e flaws, since water can s eep between the coating or lining and the bas e metal mois ture can become tr apped, incr easing the r ate of corrosion. Thus, it may be pos sible for a coated CM P to become deter iorated in les s time than an uncoated CM P in the s ame envir onment. Coatings applied to exis ting s urfaces of conduits are gener ally not ver y effective due to dif ficulties involved in obtaining a good bond with the conduit surface. For guidance on es timating the s ervice lif e of CMP conduits , see the National Corrugated Steel P ipe As sociation's CSP Durability Guide (2000) and FHWA's , Durability of Special Coatings for Corrugated Steel Pipe (1991). Caution should be exercised in attempting to deter mine the s ervice lif e of CMP used in conduits through embankment dams. Many of these CMPs may have used no corrosion protection, and many of the coatings and linings available today were not available when the embankment dams were originally cons tructed. Prior to 1950, galvanized steel was the only metallic coating available for CMP. If a CMP has experienced denting during ins tallation, this could res ult in corros ion in areas where the protective coating has been damaged. Figures 110 through 113 show the results of corrosion af fecting CM P outlet wor ks conduits . Corrosion of reinforcement in concr ete conduits can als o occur when it becomes expos ed. Reinforcement can become expos ed by cracking or s palling of the concr ete (figure 114), inadequate cover , or porous concr ete. When r einforcement is expos ed to cor rosive elements , the ir on oxides formed expand (r equir ing mor e space within the concrete than the original reinforcement), res ulting in tens ile stresses within the s urrounding concr ete. These tens ile stresses caus e cracking and delamination of the concrete. Rust stains on the conduit surface may be an indicator of reinforcement cor rosion. Cathodic protection attempts to retard electrochemical corrosion through the application of reverse direct current to the protected metal and to another metal which acts as a sacrificial anode. This sacrificial anode, typically cons isting of either zinc, magnesium, graphite, or aluminum alloys, must be periodically replaced. New concrete installations in hostile corrosive environments should place special attention on cr ack widths and concr ete cover , as well as cons ider the us e of protective coatings, before considering this often problematic and costly means of protecting agains t steel cor rosion. Galvanic r eaction between dis similar metals can als o result in corrosion. This can occur when a galvanic r eaction f orms between r einforcing steel and stainless steel outlet works components. Another form of corros ion is bacterial corros ion (Patenaude, 1984) caus ed anaer obic s ulfate-reducing bacter ia. Bacterial cor rosion typically has been f ound to occur on galvanized steel pipe. This type of corrosion can exist in two environments 185 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 110 .\u2014CMP corrosion within an outlet works conduit. Figure 111 .\u2014CMP corrosion on the invert of an outlet works conduit. Figure 112 .\u2014CMP corrosion within an outlet works conduit caused by a leaking pipe joint. Figure 113.\u2014An outlet w orks condui t that has experienced corrosi on and failure. Figure 114.\u2014Spa lled concr ete and exposed rei nforcem ent in an outlet works condui t. 186 Chapter 8\u2014Potential Defects Associated with Conduits and have differing products of corrosion. Soil-related bacterial corrosion produces oxidation scale, which is active in organic, poorly drained soils of nearly neutral pH. This scale is usually black, but upon being exposed to aerated conditions in conduits, becomes rust colored. Water-related bacterial corrosion produces nodular oxidation, which exis ts on pipe s urfaces associated with a water source of nutr ients. Local on the pipe plas tic pipe is not s ubject to galvanic action and will not corrode. Naturally occurring water and s oil conditions will not affect the pipe. 8.2 Poor des ign and cons truction Good design and construction practice can extend the service life of a conduit. However, poor design and construction practice can greatly shorten it. Much of the following discussion w as adapted from U SACE's Evaluation and Repair of Concrete Structures (1995b, pp. 3-1 to 3-14) for reinforced cas t-in-place concrete. Some of the most common areas where poor design and construction practice can affect conduits are: Poor design practice .\u2014Design errors may be divided into two general types: those resulting from inadequate s tructural des ign and thos e resulting from lack of attention to relatively minor design details. Common design errors include: 1. Inadequate structura l design.\u2014Inadequate s tructural des ign expos es the concrete to greater stre ss tha n it is c apable of carrying, or greater stra in than its stra in capacity. This may result in excessively high compre ssive stresses and appear as spalling. Similarly, high tors ion or s hear stresses may als o result in s palling or cracking. Also, high tens ile stresses will res ult in cracking. To prevent this from occur ring, the des igner must complete a thorough and careful review of all design calculations. Any renovation that makes use of existing conduit mus t be car efully reviewed. 2. Poor design details .\u2014While a conduit may be adequately des igned to meet loadings and other overall requirements , poor detailing may res ult in localized concentrations of high stresses in otherwise satisfactory concrete. These high s tresses may r esult in cr acking that allows water to acces s the interior of the concrete. In general, poor detailing does not lead directly to concrete failure; rather, it contributes to the action of one of the other causes of concrete deterioration described in this chapter. A frequent cause of cracking in conduits is impr operly spaced joints . Thermal cracking can also result in conduits where joint spacings are too long or are not provided in the conduit to accommodate for changes of length. In general, all of these problems can be prevented by a thorough and careful 187 Conduits through Embankment Dams review of plans and s pecifications for the pr oject. In the cas e of existing conduits , problems resulting from poor detailing s hould be handled by correcting the detailing and not by s imply res ponding to the s ymptoms . Poor construction practice .\u2014Not f ollowing s pecified pr ocedur es and techniques may res ult in cons truction errors . While individually thes e errors may not lead directly to f ailure, when gr ouped together they could lead to the development of defects that could adver sely af fect a conduit's integr ity. Cons truction er rors can occur during new construction, renovation, and repairs. In concrete, cracking and s palling can be a s ymptom of poor cons truction practice. Common construction operly located or is not adequately secured in the proper location may lead to two general types of problems. First, the reinforcement may not function structurally as intended, resulting in structural cracking or failure. The second type of problem stemming from improperly located or tied reinforcement is one of durability. T his involves reinforcement that is improperly located near the surface of the concr ete. As the concr ete cover over the r einforcement is reduced by wear , it is much eas ier for corrosion to begin. 2. Improper alignment of formwork.\u2014Improper alignment of the formwork leads to dis continuities on the s urface of the concr ete. This occur rence is critical in ar eas that ar e subjected to high velocity f low of water , such as wher e cavitation- erosion may be induced. 3. Adding water to concrete .\u2014Water is usually added to concrete at the delivery truck to incr ease slump and decr ease emplacement ef fort. This practice generally leads to concrete with lowered s trength and reduced durability. As the water /cement r atio of the concr ete incr eases, the s trength and durability decreas es. 4. Improper con solidation.\u2014Improper consolidation of concrete may result in a variety of defects, the mos t common being s urface air voids (also known as bugholes ), honeycombing, and cold joints . Surface air voids are formed when small pockets of air or water are trapped against the forms. A change in the mixtur e to make it les s \"sticky\" or the us e of small vibr ators worked near the f orm has been us ed to help eliminate s urface air voids . Honeycombing can be r educed by ins erting the vibr ator more frequently, inserting the vibr ator as closely as possible to the f orm face without touching the form, and slower withdrawal of the vibrator. Obviously, any or all of these def ects make it much eas ier for any damage- causing mechanism to initiate deterioration of the concrete. Frequently, a fear of \"overcons olidation\" is used to jus tify a lack of effort in cons olidating 188 Chapter 8\u2014Potential Defects Associated with Conduits concrete. Overconsolidation is usually defined as a situation in which the consolidation ef fort caus es all of the coar se aggr egate to s ettle to the bottom while the pas te rises to the s urface. If this situation occur s, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a problem of a poorly proportioned concrete rather than too much consolidation. 5. Movem ent of form work.\u2014Move ment of formw ork during the period w hile the concrete is going from a fluid to a rigid material may induce cracking and separation within the concrete. Cracks open to the surface allow access of wa ter to the interior of the concrete. An interna l void ma y give rise to corrosion probl ems if the void becomes saturated. 6. Settling of the subgrade .\u2014Poor foundation support can impart tensile stresses, resulting in cracking of the concrete conduit. This often occurs during the period after the concrete begins to become rigid, but before it gains enough strength to support its own weight; cracking may also occur. 7. Settling of the concrete .\u2014Dur ing the per iod between placing and initial s etting of the concrete, the heavier components of the concrete settle under the influence of gravity. This situation may be aggravated by the use of highly fluid concretes. If any restra int tends to prevent this settling, cra cking or separations may result. These cracks or separations may also develop problems of corrosion, if saturated. 8. Vibration of freshly placed concrete.\u2014 Most c onstruc tion sites are subjected to vibration from various sources, such as blasting and from the operation of construction equipment. Freshly placed concrete is vulnerable to weakening of its properties if subjected to forces that disrupt the concrete matrix during setting. 9. Premature rem oval of shores or reshores .\u2014If shores or reshores are removed too soon, the concrete affected may become overstressed and cracked. In extreme cas es, there may be major failures. 10. Improper curing.\u2014Curing is probably the most abused aspect of the concrete construction process. Unless concrete is given adequate time to cure at a proper humidity and temperature, it will not develop the characteristics that ar e expected and that ar e neces sary to pr ovide durability. Symptoms of improperly cured concrete can include various types of cracking and surface disintegration. In extreme cases, where poor curing lea ds to fa ilure to a chieve a nticipa ted concrete strengths, structura l cracking may occur . 189 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 115 shows an example of poor construction practice (improper consolidation of concrete). For an example of how poor design and construction practice can lead to the failure of a concrete conduit, see the Olufson Dam case history in appendix B. Poor design and construction practices particular to reinforced cast-in-place conduits were discussed in the previous paragraphs. However, poor design and construction practices affect all types of conduits. The following paragraphs briefly discuss effects of poor design and construction practices affecting other types of conduits, such as precast concr ete, or CMP. The appear ance of these def ects can lead to pr eferential seepage paths and the development of potential failure modes for conduits. Some of these include: Deformation .\u2014Def ormation occur s when load or force changes the s hape of the conduit. Deformation is typically caused by the application of excessive external load (e.g., improper selection of design loadings), loads from heavy construction equipment, or seismic activity. Figure 116 shows an example of wher e heavy cons truction equipment likely caus ed def ormation of a CM P conduit. CMP is flexible and is designed to deform some as it transfers load into the s urrounding backfill. The surrounding backfill provides stiffnes s and load carrying capacity. Improperly des igned backfill or inadequately compacted backfill under the CMP haunches does not provide the needed lateral s tiffnes s to the CMP. This can result in excessive deformations and structural failure or collaps e of the CMP (Kula, Zamens ky, and King, 2000, p. 3). Differentia l settlem ent.\u2014Dif ferential s ettlement occur s when the embankment materials next to the conduit are improperly or inadequately compacted or when the conduit is placed on a foundation of varying density. The conduit location and the res ultant embankment loading can res ult in differential Figure 115.\u2014A rock pock et at the bottom of a condui t side wa ll. 190 Chapter 8\u2014Potential Defects Associated with Conduits Figure 116.\u2014Deformed C MP conduit. Deformation likely occurred du ring original uction, fects the s tructural integr ity of the conduit by ca using distress to the conduit in the form of misa lignment (vertical or horizontal), shape distortion, joint offsets/separations, cracks, or spalls. Differential s ettlement occur s when one s ection of conduit s ettles more than the rest. This typica lly occurs a t joints in the conduit (figure 117). The settling process can open these joints and provide a path for water either into or out of the conduit. Examples of differential settlement and the resulting damage are: 1. Spreading of the embankment dam, causing separations in the conduit joints. As compressible soils under the embankment dam consolidate, some spreading is inevitable. As soils spread laterally, s ections of the conduit may separate, leaving joint openings through which water can then move. 2. Differentia l settlement due to founda tion discontinuity, ca using offsetting of joints . 3. Differential s ettlement of the embankment dam, caus ing loads greater than the conduit can accommodate, r esulting in cr acking and exces sive deformation of the conduit. Misalignment.\u2014Misalignment occurs when poor construction practice allows for alignment deviation or from improper or inadequate compaction of 191 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 117.\u2014Thi s condui t was severely damaged after the founda tion settled m ore than 2 feet. embankment materials next to the conduit. Misalignment can also be caused by compression of the foundation allowing rotation at the conduit sections. Separation of joints .\u2014Separation of pipe joints occurs when the conduit exper iences deformation, dif ferential s ettlement, mis alignment, or shear strains as a result of a weak foundation. Joint separation can result in a loss of conduit water tightnes s by allowing s eepage to exit thr ough the joint. The lack of joint gaskets being installed, or installation of the incorrect type of gasket, or the use of incor rect joint- connecting bands also affects water tightnes s. Seepage can lead to internal erosion or backward erosion piping of surrounding embankment materials and loss of support around the conduit. 192 Chapter 9 Inspect ion and A ssessment of Conduit-Relat ed Problems Inspection of embankment dams, including their conduits and foundations, will detect many developing problems before they can affect the safety and reliable operation of the facility. Inspection s hould als o assess the adequacy and quality of maintenance and operation procedures. Periodic inspection may reveal trends that indicate more serious problems are developing. The conduit is typically inspected as part of an overall inspection of the embankment dam and its appurtenant features. Typically, structural defects and deterioration develop progressively over time. A trained and exper ienced ins pector can identif y defects and potential pr oblems before existing conditions in the embankment dam and conduit become serious. However, some situations can suddenly arise and cause serious damage in a short period of time. Examples of these situations are operations at full discharge capacity, seismic activity, or other special conditions. The need for special inspections should be evaluated af ter occur rence of any of these situations . The main f ocus of this chapter is on the ins pection of conduits . However , reference is made to cer tain as pects of embankment dam ins pection, s ince they have r elevance to pr oblems associated with conduits. In 1986, 14 federal and State agencies developed a comprehens ive training program (Training Aids for Dam Safety [T ADS]) des igned to train individuals involved with, or having res pons ibility for the s afety of dams . The TADS program cons ists of modules that can be tailored to meet individual or organizational needs. The TADS program is widely used and recognized by the dam safety community. Further details on the TADS program are available from the Bureau of R eclamation. Additionally, training courses on dam safety inspection are available from various sources. Interested parties should consult the ASDSO website for a listing of available training opportunities. For information concerning inspection of penstocks see the Amer ican Society of Civil Engineer s (ASCE) Guidelines for Evaluating Aging Penstocks (1995). 193 Conduits through Embankment Dams 9.1 Types of inspections Inspection intervals may vary, depending on the overall conditions determined from previous inspections and the exis tence of any dam s afety concer ns. Periodic inspections can vary in scope and purpose and by the organization or personnel (damtender , agency/dis trict level, etc.) per forming the ins pection. Dam safety organizations and embankment dam owners may employ a variety of inspections during the lif e of a conduit (f igure 118). These inspections may include the following types (R eclamation, 1988, p. I-2): Initial or formal .\u2014Initial or formal ins pections include an in-depth review of all pertinent data available f or the conduit to be ins pected. Design and construction da ta are eva luated rela tive to the current sta te-of-the-a rt to identify potential dam safety problems or areas requiring particular attention. A thorough onsite inspection of all features is conducted, and an attempt is made to operate all mechanical equipment through their full operating range, if possible. Many State and f ederal agencies require formal ins pections on a s et frequency (e.g., ever y 6 year s). The firs t time the res ervoir behind an embankment dam is filled is critical to its integrity. The embankment dam will experience the hydraulic loading for the first time and will begin to adjus t to this loading. During firs t filling, the wetting front begins to penetrate the embankment dam. History has shown that a much higher frequency of incidents occur at this time. Also, the conduit through the embankment dam will be tes ted for the firs t time. Good practice dictates that the embankment dam be monitored by frequent inspections during this crucial period. Round-the-clock s urveillance is not uncommon for high hazard facilities . Special lighting provis ions may be installed to permit adequate nighttime vis ibility. There may be s everal \"hold\" periods during initial fill to allow s tresses in the embankment dam to partially s tabilize and ins trumentation to level off prior to the continuation of filling. The rate of res ervoir ris e may be limited to allow for the wetting front to slowly penetrate the embankment dam. A rate of reservoir rise in the r ange of 0.5 to 2 f eet per day is a common. Limiting the r ate of rise for small reservoirs that do not usually have large outlet systems may not be feasible. If the outlet conduit has a small capacity and large inflows follow a high precipitation event, no method for controlling the rate of ris e exists. The firs t fill monitoring may be s taggered to accommodate the amount of water available to fill the res ervoir. For s ome embankment dams , many years may be required to reach their fully operational reservoir level. Often, an embankment 194 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems Figure 118.\u2014Visual inspecti on for seepa ge on the downstrea m face of a n embankment da m. dam reaching a new record reservoir elevation during a flood is also considered to be in f irst fill status, neces sitating heightened ins pections . This is becaus e portions of the embankment dam may have never received hydr aulic loading until the f lood s tage was enter ed. Following a major modification to an embankment dam, the dam may also be placed in a firs t fill monitoring s ituation, if the modifications were extens ive. For example, if an exis ting conduit wer e completely r emoved and r eplaced, this would likely require firs t fill monitoring s tatus. Complete removal and replacement of the conduit would require a section of the embankment to be excavated and r eplaced. For guidance on the r emoval and r eplacement of conduits , see chapter 13. Periodic or intermediate .\u2014Periodic or intermediate inspections are conducted between f ormal ins pections . An in depth r eview is made of all per tinent data available on the conduit to be ins pected. However , the data r eview f ocuses on the current sta tus of the conduit, a nd the da ta are not eva luated rela tive to current state-of-the-art criteria. A thorough onsite inspection of all features is conducted. All mechanical equipment may not be tested during any one inspection. Some equipment may be operated at another time or during the next inspection. Routine.\u2014Routine inspections are typically conducted by field or operating personnel. The primary focus is on the current condition of the conduit. 195 Conduits through Embankment Dams Available data may not be r eviewed and evaluated pr ior to the ins pection, depending on the ins pector's familiarity with the conduit. Inspections may be scheduled regularly or performed in conjunction with other routine tasks. Special .\u2014A special inspection is conducted when a unique opportunity exists for inspection. For example, if low water conditions exist in a r eservoir expos ing a normally inundated s tructure, a s pecial ins pection may be ar ranged. Emerg ency.\u2014An emer gency ins pection is performed when an immediate dam safety concer n is present or in the event of an unus ual or potentially adver se condition (i.e., immediately f ollowing an ear thquake). The actual ter ms and meanings used to def ine the types of inspection may var y between dam s afety organizations and embankment dam owner s. The operating personnel responsible for daily operation and maintenance of the facility s hould als o participate as inspection team members . Where applicable, water user organization representatives should also participate in the inspection. Additionally, the applicable State water resource agency may need to be advis ed for their possible participation in the inspection. To the extent possible, inspections should be scheduled in different seasons. This will enable the s tructure or facility to be examined under differing res ervoir levels , water deliver y, and s ite conditions . Before beginning ins pection of a facility, the ins pection team s hould dis cuss the order in which f eatures are to be examined, to accommodate oper ations , as well as to ensure tha t time for the inspection tea m is appropria tely a llotted. In addition, the team should conduct a job hazard analysis (JHA) prior to the inspection, whereby procedures and equipment necessary to minimize or avoid potential safety and health hazar ds are discussed. Of primary impor tance is the need f or detailed clear ance (particular ly if there are conf ined s paces), and lockout or \"tag- out\" pr ocedur es when acces sing eas affected by equipment or gate/valve oper ations . For guidance on preparing a J HA, see section 9.4. 9.2 Factors influencing s cheduling of ins pections Scheduling of periodic conduit ins pections may be influenced by (Reclamation, 1988, p. III-7): Sufficient notice .\u2014Embankment dam owners and operators may need sufficient time to make neces sary arrangements , such as preinspections associated with lockout/tagout and conf ined s pace entr y, or special equipment or appr oval f or 196 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems unwatering conduits, terminal structures, or pools. This process could require several weeks or months , depending on the f acility. Scheduling access .\u2014Acces s for the ins pection s hould be s cheduled when mos t or all of the major components of the conduit can be examined. Some features, such as intake structures and upstream conduits, are usually submerged and not acces sible. Downs tream conduits and ter minal s tructures may or may not be able to be unwater ed and made acces sible for inspection. The embankment dam owner or operator may be requested to provide notification when reservoir conditions permit or when the reservoir can be drawn down to allow the inspection to be performed. If the f eature to be ins pected is normally inundated and inacces sible, cer tain factors (R eclamation, 1985, p. 4) should be considered in determining the extent and f requency f or inspection, s uch as : 1. Results of previous \"hands on\" inspection or evidence from the inspection of the normally accessible portions of the feature. Inspection of the normally accessible portion of a feature may provide information on the probable condition of the inaccessible portion. This information may include: a. Conditio n of the feature .\u2014Cracking, joint separation, or significant deterioration. b. Conditio n of the embankment dam and fo undatio n.\u2014Exces sive postconstruction settlement or alignment distortion of tream conduit; exces sive embankment dam s ettlement or the existence of sinkholes on the upstream face along the alignment of the conduit. c. Observed seepage.\u2014Seepage or wet ar eas observed at the downs tream toe of the embankment dam. d. Flow conditions .\u2014Changes in the dis charge capacity of the conduit. e. Damag e and de terioration.\u2014Damage or deterioration of gates/valves and met alwork. f. Water quality .\u2014W ater qua lity known to be detrimenta l to concrete, conduit linings, or waterstops. Excessive amounts of sand or other material transported by the discha rge. . 197 Conduits through Embankment Dams 2. Operational history and performance of the feature, since its previous inspection. 3. Relative cos ts for providing acces s for inspection of the f eature, including costs associated with los t water and power revenues . 4. Age of the f eature. 5. Design and construction considerations, such as: a. Changes in sta ndards or guid elines.\u2014Des ign cr iteria, cons truction techniques, and/or quality of material at the time of construction fail to meet cur rent standar ds or guidelines . b. Foundatio n conditio ns.\u2014The conduit was constructed on foundation of varying compres sibility, where there is a potential for differential settlement. This may r esult in cr acking of the conduit or exces sive opening of joints . Differential s ettlement is also possible between the conduit and gate chamber due to different pressures being exerted on them. c. Foundatio n faults .\u2014The conduit cr osses a foundation f ault wher e ther e is the potential for movement or disruption of the conduit. d. Unfavorable stresses .\u2014The conduit is located wher e conditions are conducive to arching, res ulting in unfavorable s tresses in the embankment dam and/or conduit. These stresses could be conducive to hydraulic fracture of the embankment dam or stress concentrations on the conduit. e. Conduit within the core of the embankment dam .\u2014A significant portion of the conduit ups tream from the gate chamber lies within the cor e of the embankment dam, s o that any cr acks in the conduit cr eate the potential f or water to be injected under pressure into the cor e. If erodible ma terial is used to construct the impervious core, the potential f or adver se cons equences is increased. f. Inadequate co nduit jo ints.\u2014Inadequately s ealed or encas ed conduit joints , which could lead to the es cape of water under pressure, which creates the potential f or water to be injected under pressure into the surrounding embankment. g. Filters .\u2014Lack of adequate filters and drainage material around the conduit downstream from the im pervious zone of the embankment 198Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems dam to s afely convey s eepage or leakage along the conduit to an exit point. 6. Critical function of the feature. 7. Any exis ting s ite conditions that may compr omise the s afety of the f eature. The appropriate frequency and extent to which the normally inundated features are examined will vary bas ed on available information. The review pers onnel and decis ionmakers will need to determine the appropriate frequency and extent based on the above factors. As an example, R eclamation has identified about 6 years as an appropriate frequency for a \"hands-on or equivalent inspection f requency\" f or inacces sible features, such as conduit. Operatio n.\u2014Certain problems may not normally appear when the feature is dry that appear when the f eature is being oper ated. Also, when a f eature is operating during a period of higher than normal releases, additional information may be gathered that may not have been available during normal operations. The oppor tunity to optimize both acces s and oper ation dur ing a s ingle ins pection typically is not possible. Inspection objectives may have to alternate from one inspection to the next. This may neces sitate the need f or scheduling \"s pecial\" inspections during unusual conditions, in addition to regular inspections to provide a comprehensive understanding of the conduit safety. Special inspections may be required after floods , seismic activity, or other unus ual or extreme events . 9.3 Periodic inspections by selected organizations The frequency of periodic inspections varies among organization and embankment dam owner s. Emer gency s ituations may r equire much mor e frequent ins pections , such as daily or hourly. Situations can arise suddenly that cause serious damage in a short period of time. Examples of these problems are operations at full discharge capacity, s eismic activity, or other special conditions . The need f or special inspections should be evaluated af ter occur rence of any of these situations . A sampling of periodic inspections as required by selected organizations: Reclamatio n.\u2014Reclamation employs the following process (R eclamation, 1998c, pp. 2-11) to monitor its significant and high hazard dams and attempt to detect any potential dam s afety def iciencies : 1. Annually .\u2014Annual inspections are performed by inspectors who are generalis t (as oppos ed to s pecialis t) engineers very familiar with the 199 Conduits through Embankment Dams embankment dam and its operations, and can readily distinguish changes from year to year. All inspectors attend regular training in dam safety inspections . 2. Periodic .\u2014On a 6-year cycle (alter nating with the compr ehensive facility review (CF R), each embankment dam is examined by a team or iginating in a Reclamation Regional Office, including the regional examination specialis t. This examination is referred to as a periodic facility review (PFR ) and includes a rather thorough review and reporting of all past dam safety and operation and maintenance (O&M) recommendations. 3. Comprehensive.\u2014On a 6- year cycle (alter nating with the P FR; the CF R and PFR are offset by 3 year s), each embankment dam is examined/evaluated by a team of specialis ts from Reclamation's Technical Ser vice Center that includes an examination s pecialis t, mechanical engineer , and a s enior dam engineer (either geotechnical or civil/s tructural specialis t). This examinat ion is referred to as a CF R and includes not only t he PFR activities, but also technical evaluation of all design, construction, and analys is of the dam. Federal Ene rgy Regulatory Commission (FERC) .\u2014Significant and high hazard embankment dams are inspected annually by F ERC engineer s and ever y 5 year s for a Part 12D ins pection by an independent cons ultant (FERC, 2005, pp. 14 - 43 to 14- 45). FERC engineer s inspect low hazar d embankment dams at leas t every 3 year s. An independent cons ultant als o inspects some low hazar d embankment dams ever y 5 year s, if the dam is 30 or more feet high or the reservoir is 2,000 acr e-feet or larger and the licens ee or exemptee has not requested and r eceived appr oval f or an exemption f rom the P art 12D independent consultant inspection. NRCS.\u2014The NR CS requires the sponsor/owner to be responsible for making inspections after they are turned over to the sponsors/owners (NR CS, 2003, pp. 1-2). Personnel trained in conducting the inspections perform special, annual, and f ormal (once ever y 5 year s) inspections . If requested by the sponsor/owner, NR CS may participate in inspections; provide training to ensure that the sponsor/owner understands inspection techniques and the impor tance of completing cor rective action; and pr ovide technical as sistance to address specific O&M needs . If an ins pection r eveals an imminent thr eat to lif e or property, the sponsor/owner shall immediately notify all emergency management authorities. USACE .\u2014The USACE performs periodic, intermediate, and informal inspections on the basis of project size, importance, or potential hazard (USACE, 2004b, pp. 6-3 and 6-4): 200 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems 1. Initial periodic inspection .\u2014The first periodic inspection and evaluation of a new embankment dam is carried out immediately after topping out of the dam prior to impoundment of the pool. 2. Second periodic inspection .\u2014The second periodic inspection for new embankment dams is performed no later than 1 year after impoundment is initiated. 3. Subsequent p eriodic insp ection.\u2014Subsequent periodic inspections are performe d at 1-year inte rvals for the next 2 y ears. The next tw o inspections are per formed at 2- year inter vals and then extended to a maximum inte rval of 5 y ears. More frequent inspe ction inte rvals are scheduled, if conditions warrant. 4. Intermediate inspection .\u2014For projects on a 5- year inspection cycle, an intermediate ins pection of all or s ome of the features may be s cheduled, if warranted. Selection is based on consequences of failure, age, degree of routine obs ervation, a natur al event (i.e., ear thquake), per formance r ecord and history of remedial measures. Intermediate inspections are also made of any portion of a project exposed during unwatering that could not be accomplished during scheduled periodic inspection. 5. Inform al inspection.\u2014Appr opriate employees at the pr oject per form frequent informal ins pections . The purpos e of informal ins pection is to identify and report abnormal conditions and evidence of distress. 9.4 Preparing for an inspection The success of a conduit inspection depends upon good planning and preparation. Any inspection should consider: Selection of the inspection team .\u2014The members of the ins pection team will vary, depending on the needs and resources of the organization or embankment dam owner , type of the ins pection, r esults of the data r eview, and any s pecial require ments. Review of project data .\u2014The amount of available data may var y greatly. The extent of project data review and evaluation depends on the type of inspection to be conducted. Preparation of an ins pection plan.\u2014A detailed inspection plan should be prepared to identif y all features to be ins pected, pr oblem ar eas, and ar eas of potential problems . The inspection plan will als o identif y special logis tics, acces s, or 201Conduits through Embankment Dams equipment r equirements . An ins pection checklis t is typically pr epared as part of an ins pection plan. The checklis t is used to identif y specific inspection objectives and is also useful in developing the final inspection report. Prior to any inspection, inspection personnel should review all pertinent and available design and as-built drawings, design criteria, geology, operational history, previous inspection and maintenance reports, and safety information. Typical documents that s hould be r eviewed pr ior to an ins pection ar e: 1. Technical record of design and construction 2. Design summary 3. Laboratory reports 4. Stress model reports 5. Geology reports 6. Site s eismicity reports 7. Plans and s pecifications 8. As-built drawings 9. Final construction report 10. Construction progress reports 11. Travel reports 12. Correspondence files 13. Oper ation and maintenance r ecords 14. Examination reports 15. Designers' oper ating cr iteria 16. Standing operating procedures 17. Reservoir ope ration re cords 18. Data books 202 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems After reviewing available documentation, a list of important and significant concerns should be prepared for use during the inspection. A log should be established at the embankment dam that records the date, type of inspection performed, name of the inspectors, and the results. All inspections should be documented in the form of an inspection report with photographs, reservoir water levels, discharges from the conduit, and relevant instrumentation data, such as from nearby piezometers, and forwarded to the engineering staff or personnel responsible for technical review and evaluation. An ongoing visual inspection checklist should be developed to provide guidance and cons istency in looking for s igns of dis tress. If information is found that suggests the embankment dam, foundation, or conduit was not designed to current standards, specific items should be added to the inspection checklis t to addr ess specific def iciencies . All ins pection r eports should be maintained in a s ecure location f or future reference. Good r ecordkeeping of inspection reports , technical reports , etc. will ens ure that development of any adver se trends are identif ied and pr oper actions are taken to cor rect any problems. For further guidance on inspection programs and checklists for inspection, see Reclamation's Review of Operatio n and M aintenance Pro gram F ield Examinatio n Guidelines (1991). A job hazard analysis should be prepared for embankment dam and conduit inspections , following appr oved s afety guidelines . The bas ic elements of a JHA are outlined in Reclamation's Operation and Maintenance Safety Standards (1989b, pp. 65-66). Note: Other agencies and organizations may utilize their own s et of standards for safety guidance. All personnel involved in the inspection should r eceive and r eview a copy of the J HA. As a minimum, a J HA should include: 1. Names of all participants and the agency, organization, or group they are representing. 2. Operations to be performed. 3. Special considerations, such as monitoring of atmospheric conditions prior to entr y into conf ined s paces. Detection of adver se atmos pheric conditions at any location r equires that the conf ined s pace be mechanically ventilated or the examination be abandoned. Entry should only pr oceed upon confir mation of acceptable atmos pheric conditions . All entr ants into conf ined are to have lockout/tagout and conf ined entr y space 203 Conduits through Embankment Dams training and are required to wear an approved body harnes s to facilitate extraction of personnel should they become incapacitated. 4. Potential hazar ds associated with the conf ined s paces defined pr evious ly are engulf ment by water capable of irritating the respiratory system; and othe r hazards (e .g., rode nts, snakes, spiders and/or insects, or crayfish). 5. Mitiga ting mea sures. . 6. Hazards and solutions. 7. Safety-related equipment, such as hard hats, safety boots, proper clothing, gloves , communication equipment, oxygen/gas detection meter , mechanical ventilation equipment, flashlights, first aid kit, rubber boots, safety lines and har nesses, extraction/hois t equipment, and eye pr otection. 8. Safety standards re quire ments. 9. Emer gency s ervices. 10. Signa tures of the inspection tea m members indica ting tha t they ha ve reviewed the J HA and have been ins tructed in and under stand the requirements and hazar ds associated with the entr y into conf ined s paces for the purpose of conducting this examination. Upon completion of the inspection, all participants should discuss the inspection to identif y what could be impr oved in the J HA for the next time. Any findings or recommendations should be documented for inclusion in future JHAs. Any mishaps or near misses should be identified during the postinspection discussion. A dive plan or dive hazard assessment should be prepared prior to any dive inspection. Most commercial diving companies have their own dive plans. Guidance on dive safety can be found in Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standards 29 CFR , Subpart T, Commercial Diving Operations\u2014Genera l Industry (2004), and the Association of Diving Contractors Interna tional's (ADC I), Consensus Standar ds for Commercial Div ing and Unde rwater Operatio ns (2004). Various government agencies have guidance on dive safety, such as Reclamation's Safety and Health Standards Section 29\u2014 Marine and Diving Operations (2002). 204 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems 9.5 Performing the inspection . Methods used for the inspection of the various features of a conduit mainly depend upon acces sibility. Factor s influencing acces sibility include: Inundatio n.\u2014Reservoir operations and water levels may make some features unavailable f or normal ins pection and r equire specialized ins pection s ervices (e.g., dive tea m, remotely opera ted vehicles). Confined space.\u2014Certain features may require OSHA confined space permitting for man-entry, lockout/tagout procedures, and preparation of a JHA. An alternative to man- entry is the us e of specialized ins pection s ervices (i.e., clos ed circuit television). Size constraints .\u2014Limitations in size may pr event man- entry and r equire specialized ins pection s ervices (i.e., clos ed cir cuit televis ion). 9.5.1 Inspection of entrance structures In mos t cases, due to the entr ance s tructure's location in the r eservoir, it is either partially or fully inundated. If the entrance s tructure is partially inundated, inspection of the s tructure above the water level will be fairly s traightforward. However , inspection of the por tion of the s tructure below the water level, s uch as the intake or inlet, tr ashracks, fish screens, ice pr evention s ystems, gates /valves stoplogs pection s ervices . If the intake s tructure is a tower , it may have a wet well or some other acces s to the control mechanis m. Closure of a guard gate or bulkhead may provide the ability for inspection of the inter ior of the tower . Problems common to entr ance s tructures include deterioration, damage, and misalignment. Descriptions of more specific problems related to trashracks, fish screens, ice prevention systems, gates/valves, stoplogs, bulkeads, and bridges are beyond the scope of this document. The TADS program as discussed earlier in this chapter should be referred to for more detailed information concerning the inspection of entrance s tructures. 9.5.2 Inspection of conduits Gener ally, conduits with diameter s 36 inches or larger can be ins pected by man- entry, if proper OSHA precautions are taken. Conduits with diameters smaller than 36 inches are gener ally inacces sible for man- entry and r equire specialized ins pection services. 205 Conduits through Embankment Dams 9.5.2.1 Exterior inspection Exterior inspection of the areas above and surrounding the conduit can provide many clues concerning the condition of the conduit. Items to look for include: Look for signs of infiltration of soil into the conduit. Depressions, sinkholes (figures 119 and 120), or cavities that exit onto the s urface of the embankment dam along the center line conduit alignment ar e usually an indication that internal erosion or backward erosion piping is occurring. These features often appear as holes that line up with one another. Such features should be marked with r eference points and monitor ed to deter mine whether they ar e expanding with time. Sinkholes should be probed to determine the extent of the void, which may be dome s haped and enlar ge with depth. The seepage and f low conditions on the downstream slope and through the conduit, should be examined f or evidence of association with the s inkhole. Sinkholes are a caus e for immediate concern and further investigation. Beware that some animals may take over these areas, and they may not be r ecognizable as sinkholes or cavities . Look f or signs of seepage or indications that s eepage is sometimes present. The bes t time to look f or seepage may be when the conduit is oper ating in a pressurized condition or at full discharge capacity. Evaluate the following: 1. If an ar ea on the s urface of the embankment dam is wet, the ar ea should be marked or staked, and photographed, to see if it is expanding over time. If the s eepage is flowing, meas ures should be taken, s uch as the installation of a weir , to collect and meas ure the quantity of flow. A seepage r ate that is increasing faster than expected, r elative to the r eservoir level, may be an indication of internal erosion or backward erosion piping. Seepage in thes e areas may be char acterized by incr eased vegetative growth or the pr esence of plants that thr ive in wet ar eas. If instrumentation is available, measurements of seepage should be compar ed to pr evious meas urements to reveal changes in flow rates. Piezometers should also be monitored. 2. The quantity of seepage along the conduit or through the conduit's backfill may indicate that adequate compaction around the conduit was not achieved or internal erosion or backward erosion piping is occurring. The area wher e water outlets from a s eepage diaphr agm s hould be clos ely monitor ed. Seepage ar eas may be indicated by changes in vegetation or color . The limits of a newly wet ar ea should be mar ked to deter mine whether the ar ea is increasing in s ize. When pos sible, the s eepage s hould be channeled away from the embankment dam and directed through a pipe, weir, or other device that will allow the quantity to be meas ured. 206 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems Figure 119.\u2014Sinkhole i n the cr est of a n embankment da m. Figure 120.\u2014Sinkhole a round a spillway riser. Photo cour tesy of Schna bel Engineering. Measurement of flow by a s topwatch and bucket is a simple way to collect f low information. Installation of a weir and staff gauge is preferred for more uniform data collection under longer term conditions. 207 Conduits through Embankment Dams 3. The quality of any s eepage, es pecially whether it is carrying soil par ticles should be analyzed. Water seeping into, out of, or along a conduit can cause problems by car rying par ticles with the f low. If the quality and quantity of the wa ter flowing into the conduit is different from the wa ter flowing out of the conduit, then it is likely that open joints or cracks are allowing additional seepage flow to enter the conduit, or normal discharge to leak out. The appear ance of the f low at the ar ea wher e water outlets from a seepage diaphragm is of particular concern. Any water flowing in the vicinity of the conduit should be observed for evidence of fines being transported, such as cloudiness or discoloration. The internal erosion and backward erosion piping processes can occur intermittently, with fines being transported sporadically. Evidence of fines being carried in seepage is cause for concern, further investigation, and prompt action. The monitoring of any condition involving seepage or discharge should also include the corresponding reservoir pool level. Any sudden change, or unusual trend over time, which does not correspond to changes in the reservoir level, could indicate a s eepage pr oblem. For example, an incr ease in the s eepage r ate while the pool level is constant could be an indication of internal erosion. Pool levels may be measured by a staff gauge, by calibrations placed on a fixed structure in the r eservoir, or by water -level s ensing devices . Look for signs of internal erosion or backward erosion piping where the conduit exits the downstream slope of the embankment dam near the terminal structure. Water flowing through cracks in the earthfill or along the conduit may er ode s oils and caus e a cloudy ef fluent with tur bulent f low. Depos its of sand may form at the exit point of seepage. Water escaping from intergranular seepage in gr anular soils may cr eate s and boils , and the f low is less likely to be turbid. Other indicators of developing problems include deposits of sediment not as sociated with r unoff, sinkholes , and s igns of settlement, s uch as depressions on the surface of the embankment dam or its foundation. Any changes in the embankment dam or foundation in the vicinity of the conduit. Since the location of a conduit represents a unique condition in the embankment dam, and a potential s eepage path thr ough the dam, any changes in the vicinity of the conduit s hould be inves tigated. Such changes might include s lope movement, changes in vegetation, ar eas of new or unexpected wetnes s or seepage, unus ual piezometr ic readings , etc. Check the expos ed ar eas of the conduit f or cracking, weather ing, and/or chemical deterioration. Look for any whirlpools in the reservoir in the vicinity of the conduit. 208Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems During operation of the conduit, additional items of concern include: 1. Any unusual noises, such as popping, banging, or vibrations should be investigated. Vibrations may occur, if the conduit is not properly supported. Vibrations could adversely affect the conduit and surrounding backfill. 2. Color changes or fines observed in the discharge water coming out of the conduit. 3. Pulsating or uns table flow. 4. Unexplained reductions in discharge capacity. 9.5.2.2 Inter ior inspection . Typical problems within the interior of conduits include deterioration, obstructions, joint of fsets and s eparations , defective joints , cracking, and mechanical equipment misoperation (figures 121 and 122). If the conduit is acces sible, the ins pector should us e a meas uring tape or pace of f the locations of all damaged or questionable areas within the conduit. Damage or questionable areas should be documented us ing still, digital, or video camera equipment. If the conduit is inacces sible, CCT V ins pection equipment s hould be utilized. The interior inspection should look for: Water ponding on the invert of the conduit, which could be an indication of settlement- related pr oblems in cer tain r eaches of the conduit, es pecially if the conduit as-built drawings show a constant invert slope. The locations of cracks should be documented using a crack map or similar reporting method. Be aware of any previously reported cracks, and note any new cr acks. The length and width of the cr ack s hould be meas ured. To get an indication of the continuity of cracks through a concrete structure, use a geologist's pick or similar hammer to tap the concrete and listen for changes of pitch that give clues to the condition of the concrete. At some selected sites where accessible conduits are constructed on compressible or nonuniform foundations , strain gauges , total s tress cells , and cr ack meter s have been us ed to monitor changing conditions. For guidance on performing a crack survey, see USACE's Evaluation and Repair of Concrete Structures (1995b, pp. 2-1 to 2-13).

The ideal time to look f or seepage thr ough thes e areas is when the conduit has been r ecently unwater ed and water may be dr aining into the conduit from the surrounding embankment. Spalled concrete from compression or reinforcement corrosion. Drummy or hollow-sounding concrete. The extent of deterioration may be difficult to determine. Sampling (coring) and tes ting of the material may be required. Samples taken from areas of deterioration are often compared with samples taken from good quality concrete. Testing may include determining the strength properties and use of petrographic examination. Erosion, abrasion, or damage in concrete downstream of gates/valves, offsets, and/or changes in slope. Cavitation damage. Binding of mechanical equipment. 211 Conduits through Embankment Dams Blockages at the conduit entr ance (i.e., tr ash or debr is) or at the exit (i.e., vegetation, backed up water ). In attempting to inspect the interior of a ny conduit, there ma y be difficulties to overcome, s uch as : Unwatering .\u2014A compr ehensive ins pection may be hinder ed, unles s the conduit can be unwatered. Proper precautions should be considered prior to any unwatering s ituation. The pos sibility exis ts of external pres sures being high enough to damage the unwatered conduit or vents being plugged, causing negative internal pressures to develop and collapse the conduit. This is a concer n when pr essurized conduits are unwater ed. Unwater ing a conduit may be impractical or impossible for one or more of the following reasons: 1. Lack of a bulkhead or closure device. 2. The need to limit r eservoir drawdown. Lowering of the water surface may be restricted, which would pr event expos ure of the conduit or entrance structure. 3. Structura l adequacy of the conduit to withsta nd externa l hydrosta tic pressures in a unwatered condition. Poor a ir quality.\u2014Poor air quality may exis t within conduits . Poor air quality conditions may include lack of oxygen and the exis tence of hydr ogen s ulfide. Inaccessib ility.\u2014The conduit may be too small or too dangerous for man-entry inspection. The use of CCTV inspection equipment should be considered for inaccessible conduits. If this is not feasible, the inspection must then be based solely on the condition of the exposed and/or accessible portions of the conduit. Some details of the interior may be obtained by use of a bright light and t he zoom f eature of a camer a. For an examples of a man- entry inspections of a conduits , see the Dalewood Shor es and Salmon Lake Dam case histories in appendix B. 9.5.3 Inspection of term inal structur es The terminal structure may be dry or partially inundated, depending on the time of year and the s chedule of releases through the conduit. If the ter minal s tructure is partially inundated, ins pection of the s tructure above the water level will be fairly straightforward. However, inspection of the portion of the structure below the water level, s uch as the bas in, chute blocks , baffle blocks , or end s ill, will require specialized ins pection s ervices. 212Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems Problems common to ter minal s tructures include deter ioration, damage, obstructions , misalignment, backfill and foundation deficiencies . Descriptions of more specific problems related to basin, chute blocks, baffle blocks, or end s ills are beyond the s cope of this document. The TADS program, as discussed earlier in this chapter, should be referred to for more detailed information concer ning the ins pection of terminal s tructures. 9.5.4 Specialized inspection Specialized ins pection includes the us e of a dive team, climbing team, r emotely operated vehicle (R OV), or closed circuit television. 9.5.4.1 Underwater inspections Underwater inspection is typically accomplished by either scuba diving operations or surface-supplied air diving operations. Scuba diving equipment typically includes a breathing gas supply tank, which is carried by the diver . A scuba diver has more flexibility and maneuverability compared to s urface-s upplied diving operations . However, this method of inspection limits diver communication and should be limited to areas where the diver has an unobstructed path directly to the surface. Surface-supplied diving operations provide breathing gas to the diver via an umbilical and offer deeper dive capability, the potential for longer underwater s tays, and communication between the diver and the s urface, and s hould be utilized whenever the diver enter s an over head envir onment (diver does not have a dir ect vertica l path to the surfa ce). Dive ins pections are used for the examination of conduits , and entr ance and ter minal structures . However, the focus of this section will pertain only to dive ins pections of conduits. The inspection of a conduit is often termed a \"penetration dive.\" Dive ins pections are expens ive, and the cos ts are greatly inf luenced by the depth of the dive, the elevation at which the dive is performed, and the temper ature of the water. All specialized ins pections involve a number of variables . As a general a rule of thumb, when compar ing the cos ts involved with dive ins pections to ROV inspections, dive inspections are about 3 to 5 times more expensive. A dive inspection has the advantage of using a variety of instruments for testing the structural integrity of the conduit, such as a rebound hammer for providing data on concr ete surface har dness, a magnetic r einforcing steel locator to locate and meas ure the amount of concrete cover or reinforcement, and an ultrasonic pulse velocity meter to determine the general condition of concrete based on sound measurements. Dive inspections also offer the potential for hands-on, tactile inspection of features in limited vis ibility or thos e covered with s hallow layers of organics or sediments . 213 Conduits through Embankment Dams Some important considerations for any dive inspection are (Dulin and Crofton, 2004): Certification .\u2014All divers and personnel associated with dive inspection should be certified commer cial diver s trained to meet the minimum r equirements of ADCI 's Consensus Standar ds for Commercial Div ing and Unde rwater Operations (2004) through the training standard of an accredited Association of Commercial Diving Schools program. They should be compliant with all commercial diving training standards, have onsite documentation of first aid training, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR ), and meet other standards as applicable in compliance with OSHA and ADCI standar ds. Dive team .\u2014The dive team should include the diving supervisor, a lead diver, and a backup diver for relief or emergencies. The diving team should have a Dive Master, whose primary talents are coordination of his crew and a solid understanding of what needs to be accomplished. Another member of the dive team should have a good understanding of mechanical equipment, what functions have to be maintained, and what has little importance to the equipment. Another member of the dive team should have solid experience with electr onic equipment, s uch as ultrasonic thicknes s gauges , under water still cameras, and communication equipment. All divers on the team should have the strength to a ccomplish the physica lly dema nding ta sks involved with the inspection. Communic ation.\u2014Communication with a diver under water is difficult. Everyone involved with the pr oject needs to know the chain of command and what r ole each individual plays. The means of contact, both primary and secondary, should be fully understood by all parties who may be involved with any portion of the diving inspection. Safety .\u2014A specific job hazard analysis should be performed to address all aspects of the diving operation. All parties who may be involved with any portion of the diving inspection should hold a kickoff meeting. Discussion should include the lockout tag-out (LOTO) procedure. A draft copy of the procedure should be provided to all attendees. The procedure should be finalized prior to commencement of any diving. No diving activity should start until the L OTO is finalized and accepted by all par ties involved. Diving in an envir onment wher e the diver does not have a dir ect route to the s urface is a ver y specialized ar ea of diving. No clear -cut cr iteria exis t for defining conduits that can or cannot reasonably be inspected by divers. Many conduits that are large enough f or a diver to enter may have f actors that pr eclude them f rom being inspected. Certain factors must be weighed against one another and a judgment 214 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems made as to the viability of a dive ins pection. Factors that mus t be cons idered include: Depth .\u2014As the depth of the conduit below the water surface incr eases, the difficulty of performing a dive increases. Divers have a limited amount of time on a given dive, and that time decr eases with the incr eased pressures on deeper dives . Also, as the dive becomes deeper , mor e of the allowable dive time is spent des cending to the conduit. Allowable dive times can be incr eased by means, such as using mixed gas, or diving in a pressurized \"newt suit.\" This increased dive time at depth comes at an increased cost due to requirements for items like lar ger dive cr ews, mor e specialized equipment, and a limited number s of companies that can actually do the wor k. As an example, a 25- foot deep dive at sea level using air would not have a no-decompression limit (NDL), an amount of allowable dive time before decompression is required, while an 80-foot deep dive under the same conditions would have a NDL of 40 minutes. Decompres sion diving can be utilized to increas e the work time available to the diver , but would likely come at an incr ease in the cos ts associated with the dive. Altitude .\u2014The altitude at which the conduit is located can gr eatly af fect the viability of a dive ins pection. This could really be cons idered a s ubfactor of the depth f actor. Due to the lower atmos pheric pressure at higher altitudes , the diver has an even mor e limited bottom time as sociated with a given depth of dive. For example, comparing the 80-foot deep dive previously discussed: 1. At sea level, NDL of 40 minutes 2. At 2500 feet, NDL of 30 minutes and would be treated as a 90-foot dive 3. At 5000 feet, NDL of 25 minutes and would be treated as a 100-foot dive Using decompression diving is an option for addressing the impact of altitude on dive time, but once again this would likely come with an incr eased cos t. Water temperature .\u2014As the water temper ature decr eases, it can have the ef fect of decreasing the dive time available to a diver. This is not necessarily a quantif iable var iable as it relates to dive time. Often the temper ature effect can be mitigated to some degree by the level of thermal protection worn by the diver . Care should be exer cised with extr emely , becaus failure in the ther mal pr otection meas ures (leak in s uit, hot water heater shutdown, etc.) af ter the diver has passed the NDL will neces sitate what could be a long, cold decompr ession stop with the r isk of severe hypothermia. 215 Conduits through Embankment Dams Length.\u2014As with depth, the conduit length becomes a factor relating to the amount of time the diver has available at depth. If the conduit is extremely long, it can take much more time to inspect than the diver has available. The available dive time for a long conduit can be increased, but this can be costly. Safety als o must be cons idered. Becaus e the diver does not have a dir ect path to the s urface, the f arther the diver must penetr ate into the conf ined s pace, the farther the diver is from a dir ect path to the s urface. Access .\u2014Often the entra nces to conduits a re equipped with tra shracks on the inlet s ide. The ability to remove enough of the tras hrack bars to allow eas y entry and egr ess is impor tant. Since diver s in such an over head envir onment will be utilizing s ome type of s urface-s upplied breathing gas , it is important that the acces s point be s uch that the hos es will be able to be fed into the conduit without hanging up. A second diver is required to be stationed underwater at the confined s pace entry point to tend the primary diver's umbilical. Leakage and cur rents.\u2014The leakage of downs tream gates or valves in a conduit is a safety factor that can af fect whether a dive ins pection can be s afely performed. Currents can be unpredictable. Any inspection of this type should be per formed, s uch that the diver enter s the conduit agains t any cur rent and then returns and exits with the current. In the case of an inverted siphon, this can be accomplis hed by enter ing from the downs tream end, but in the cas e of an outlet works , a submerged conduit will more than likely need to be entered from the ups tream end. Therefore, the condition of the gates or valves and how much leakage is exhibited is a big factor with res pect to the viability of a dive inspection. Conduit size .\u2014A conduit should really be large enough that the diver can turn around ins ide and exit head firs t. The size for this will obvious ly depend on the size of the individual diver and also the exact type of equipment required. Visib ility.\u2014The distance a diver can s ee is impor tant to whether a dive inspection of a conduit is advis able. In poor vis ibility s ituations , the diver can use their sense of touch for inspection. Sometimes a diver can use a hand to probe areas that cannot be s een. In the event of zero vis ibility, there would likely be little r eason to pur sue a dive ins pection, as the s hear magnitude of the entire surface of a conduit would be extr emely dif ficult to ins pect by touch alone. Also, in a circular conduit, a diver does not have a real edge or other reference point to keep track of any findings. If a dive inspection (figure 123) is planned for a conduit, consideration should be given to making a large release prior to the inspection as a means of flushing sediments from the conduit and then a llowing some a mount of time for the wa ter to settle out prior to diver entry. This time will depend on the type of s ediments in the water, but could vary from a day to a week. If visibility is good, the diver may want to us e a high 216Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems resolution hand-held video camera to document conditions existing within the conduit. The video camera can be either self-contained or configured for topside viewing. A self-contained video camera is enclos ed in a s pecial water proof case that allows for easy operation by the diver. For topside viewing, a cable is required from the camer a to the monitor located on the top. Audio can be provided during the recording by the diver or topside personnel. Video cameras can also be mounted on the diver's helmet. However, no matter how good the video camera's resolution is , if vis ibility is poor, the camera will only be able to document a f ew square inches of surface at one time. Sometimes in pressurized conduits, it may be difficult for a diver to determine, if a defect is allowing water to leak Figure 123 .\u2014Diver performing an under- water inspection. through it. In these situations the diver may want to release color ed dyes (e.g., f ood color ing) and obs erve if it gets sucked into the defect. Another option would be the use of a wand with a s tring or frayed r ope attached to it. If water is leaking out of the conduit the string or frayed rope would be sucked into the defect (Stoessel, Dunkle, and Faulk, 2004, p. 2). Temporary repairs by the divers are possible by plugging thes e def ects with Oakum or similar mater ials. However , a more permanent repair will need to be cons idered. In certain s ituations , the combined us e of diver s and ROV or CCT V equipment may be required to complete the conduit ins pection. The diver s are used to gain acces s to the conduit and place the R OV or CCTV equipment in the proper location to begin the inspection. For an example of an under water conduit ins pection, s ee the Salmon L ake Dam cas e history in appendix B. 9.5.4.2 Climb inspection Although not often required for conduits , a climbing team may be utilized to perform inspection of the inaccessible portions of intake towers and the walls of terminal s tructures (figure 124). 9.5.4.3 Remotely operated vehicle The R OV was first developed for industrial purposes to inspect oil and gas pipelines and offs hore platforms . ROVs are now being utilized for underwater ins pections of 217 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 124.\u2014Climber perf orming an inspection on a terminal structure wall. entrance and terminal s tructures and conduits . The focus of this section will pertain only to R OV inspections of conduits. ROVs are nor mally linked to a s urface power source, although untether ed models are also available. However, untethered (autonomous) vehicles are typically larger and not us ed for inspection of conduits . ROVs that ar e linked to the s urface have cables that car ry electr ical signals back and f orth between the oper ator and the vehicle. Most ROVs are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is commonly added to expand the vehicle's capabilities . These may include a s till camera, a manipulator or cutting arm, water s amplers , and instrument s that meas ure wat er clarity, light penet ration, and t emper ature. An R OV consists of a video unit, a power source for propulsion, vehicle controllers (referred to as \"joysticks\"), and a display monitor. The R OV can provide real-time viewing. Most ROVs are either observation or working clas s vehicles . An observation clas s vehicle is small and compact and is used for visual ins pection where nonintervention applications are required. Typically, observation class R OVs include a high resolution color video camera capable of zoom and manual or auto focus. Figure 125 s hows an obs ervation- class ROV enter ing the water . Precision color scanning sonar is an added option, but can be expensive. Some observation class R OVs may have a single function manipulator. Working class R OVs are typically capable of search, survey, inspection, and light intervention to depths of 218 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems Figure 125.\u2014An obser vation-class ROV enter ing the w ater to beg in an inspection. 2,000 feet. Working class vehicles can typically support a payload capacity to allow for the attachment of s ophis ticated acces sories. Most oper ator or \"pilot\" contr ols the vehicle f rom the s urface. Using a joys tick, a camera controlle r, and a video monitor, the operator move s the ROV to the desired location. The oper ator's eyes essentially \"become\" the camer a lens. The vehicle's depth and heading can be recorded. A global positioning system (GPS) is generally not available on most ROVs and is an expensive and complicated added feature that cannot be used within the conduit. Joysticks are used to control the propulsion and manipulation of the R OV and any accessory equipment. ROVs typically have three thrusters, two hor izontal and one ver tical. The thrusters allow the vehicle to move forward and backward and to turn left and right. Some ROVs may have a fourth thrus ter mounted horizontally for lateral movement. ROVs are capable of accommodating var ious attachments (i.e., a pincer claw) f or grasping, cleaning, and performing other inspection tasks. However, the addition of attachments requires larger ROVs to accommodate the attachments . Specially designed R OVs can accommodate and operate non destructive testing equipment. In the event that diving is prohibitive and dewatering of the conduit is not economically or technically practical, an ROV can be utilized. ROVs can compensate for the limitations inherent in underwater inspections performed by diver s, since they can f unction at extr eme depths and water temper atures, are not affected by altitude concer ns, remain under water for long dur ations , enter smaller 219 Conduits through Embankment Dams diameter conduits , and r epeatedly per form the s ame tas ks without s acrifice in quality. Also, the cos ts involved f or ROV ins pection ar e cons iderably les s than f or dive inspection. Inspection by R OV may be preferable in certain situations prior to performing a dive inspection. This is especially important in regards to safety. An ROV that is damaged or destroyed can be replaced. However, this is not comparable to the los s encountered by a diver who is injured or killed. Extreme caution is advis ed when per forming an ROV ins pection. The ROV operator should be qualified, experienced, and knowledgeable about the hazards involved. The potential exis ts for the ROV to become s tuck in s mall diameter conduits due to offsets, sharp bends, or debris. The R OV can also become entangled in its umbilical cable (or the umbilical cable can become entangled with debris, such as tree branches). ROVs can be expensive depending upon the level of sophistication and costs involved with the retrieval of a stuck R OV can be very expensive and time consuming. The ROV is typically ins erted into the conduit f rom the ups tream end. Depending on the entr ance s tructure's conf iguration, as sistance may be r equired from a diver to assist the R OV getting past trashracks. This approach can be used where the depth, length, and/or acces s limits a dive ins pection's viability, but it is difficult to get the ROV into the conduit. The trashracks typically have a hatch cover that can be removed, or the ROV can als o be lower ed thr ough a gate s lot to acces s the conduit. If trashracks cannot be removed, a few of the bars may need to be cut and removed to allow ins ertion of the ROV. At some sites wher e the downs tream conduit is located within a lar ger conduit, an ROV can be ins erted from the downs tream end of the conduit. For downs tream end ins ertion, the ROV is placed within the unwater ed section of conduit between the downs tream guar d and r egulating gates /valves . The ROV cables are threaded through a special manhole in the pipe. Once the conduit section is rewater ed and the guar d gate opened, the ROV can pr oceed ups tream and inspect the conduit. This method may be difficult, es pecially if umbilical cable needs to be continually fed through the opening, and should only be attempted by qualified and experience personnel. Some of the limitations using an ROV for conduit ins pection include (USACE, 1995b, p. 2-15): Two-dimensio nal.\u2014The R OV inspection provides only a two-dimensional view and does not pr oject the f ull extent of any def ect. If the conduit diameter is large, the ROV ins pection is much more likely to be limited to one s mall path along the conduit, wher eas a diver can cover a much lar ger path or wider swath as the diver moves down the conduit. Visib ility.\u2014M urky water limits the ef fectivenes s of an ROV ins pection. With an ROV in a limited vis ibility s ituation, the only area ins pected is the s mall area 220 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems directly in f ront of the camer a. A diver can us e their sense of feel, in a limited visibility s ituation and focus in on any problem areas . Orientatio n.\u2014In some situations, it may be difficult to determine the exact orientation or position of the R OV. This can impede accurate identification of the area being observed. Also, since R OVs often rely upon a compass, the steel in the conduit lining and/or concr ete reinforcement can af fect the navigation. If a CCT V camer a-crawler is used in lieu of an ROV, the length of cable tether can be meas ured to deter mine the location within the conduit. Maneuverability .\u2014In some \"tight\" ar eas the ROV may have mor e difficulty with maneuverability than divers would have in the s ame situation. Water currents can als o affect maneuverability by caus ing the tether to become entangled. The technology associated with R OVs is continually evolving. Continued advancements will allow the operator to overcome s ome of the exis ting ROV limitations by utilizing more s ophis ticated attachments and ins truments to improve diagnos tic capabilities . 9.5.4.4 Closed circuit television The use of CCTV as an inspection method has undergone significant technological advancements. The introduction of robotic and automated systems, such as smart pigs, camer a-crawlers, and other remotely contr olled vehicles has allowed pr evious ly inacces sible conduits to be ins pected. CCT V and man- entry are the mos t widely used methods of conduit inspection. CCT V is a very us eful method for examining s mall or inacces sible conduits (figures 126, 127, and 128). CCT V ins pection provides significant improvements over other methods of inspection, s uch as man- entry inspection wher e an ins pector crawls through the conduit (36 inches or larger) and documents the conditions , manual ins pection wher e a sled with a camer a is pushed thr ough the conduit us ing long pus h rods, and mechanical ins pection wher e a camer a tether ed to a wir e rope is pulled through the conduit. CCTV inspection has the advantages of being able to examine conduits regardles s of size limitations , has complete mobility, and provides real time video images. CCT V ins pection als o can be us ed in conduits wher e conf ined s pace entr y issues may require permitting prior to man-entry. OSHA regulations define a confined space as having limited acces s and egr ess, and not being des igned f or continuous human habitation. This would include not only small conduits, but also larger diameter conduits , wher e risks, costs, or system complexity may make r emote inspection more advantageous. 221 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 126.\u2014Seepa ge enter ing a CMP condui t through a defect. Figure 127.\u2014Corrosion within a 24-inch-diamet er CMP outlet works condui t. Generally, a CCTV inspection consists of a video camera attached to a self-propelled trans port vehicle (crawler). Some crawlers utilize tracks , and others use wheels . The transport vehicle and camer a are commonly r eferred to as a camer a-crawler (figure 129). An operator remotely controls both the transport vehicle and camera. The camera can provide both longitudinal and circumferential views of the interior 222 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems Figure 128.\u2014A CCTV i nspecti on ca mera-crawler entering the downstream disc harge po rtal of an outlet wor ks condui t. of the conduit s urfaces. Video images are transmitted from the ca mera to a television monitor, from which the operator can view the conditions within the conduit. The video images are recorded onto videotape (VHS) or DVD for future evaluation and documentation. The oper ator can add voice nar rative and text captions or notations as the inspection progresses. CCT V ins pection equipment was initially used for gas/oil and s ewer pipelines . Over the las t 10 to 15 year s, CCT V inspection has expanded into many applications, such as conduits. In that time period, the robotic equipment used for CCTV inspection has changed significantly. The lates t trend f or equipment us ed in CCT V is for modular efficiency (interchangeable components ), allowing greater vers atility and a wider range of applications. The benefit of modular design is the reduction of added costs required for \"application- specific\" equipment and \"cus tom des igns.\" Figure 129.\u2014Camera-crawler used for CCTV inspection of condui ts. Photo courtesy of Inuktun Ser vices, Ltd. 223 Conduits through Embankment Dams Depending on the model, camer a-crawlers used in conduits with ver y small diameter s (about 4 to 14 inches ) have camer as with s ome pan, tilt, and zoom capabilities , a wide range of tether pulling capacity (200 to 1,000 feet), and s ome steering capabilities . Camera-crawlers used in conduits with diameters of 15 inches or larger are s teerable, have a greater cable tether-pulling capacity (500 to 1,500 feet), and have cameras that can provide a wider array of optical capabilities , including pan, tilt, and zoom. As the technology of CCTV inspection equipment advances, greater tether lengths and optical capabilities will become available. Actual tether limits obtainable in the field, vary greatly, depending upon a number of factors, such as conduit diameter, bends, invert slopes, and existing invert conditions, such as sediments, mineral encrustations, and bacterial growths. In large diameter conduits , the video camer a can be attached to a s cissor mechanis m mounted to the tr ansport vehicle. The scissor mechanis m, contr olled by the operator, can r aise or lower the video camer a as needed f or inspection. In addition, the video camera usually has a high powered zoom, which can be used to provide closeup views of areas that might be dif ficult f or the tr ansport vehicle to get near . These features allow examination of very large conduits with diameter s as large as 40 or 50 feet. If required, some models of camer a-crawlers allow f or the attachment of retrieval tools , such as alligator clamps , grippers , and magnets . These tools can be us ed to remove light debris or damage. The attachment of any type of retrieval tool will require a dditiona l clea rance within the conduit to opera te the retrieva l tool. Some models of crawlers have robotic cutters attached to them. These cutters can be used to remove debris or protrusions in concrete, steel, or reinforcement. Most camera- crawler systems are por table and can be car ried to conduit acces s locations (figure 130). The use of an all- terrain vehicle (AT V) may be benef icial for transport of equipment in dif ficult acces s areas. Sometimes the conduit is too small and a transport vehicle cannot be used, or obstructions/invert conditions exist that prevent the transport vehicle from traversing the conduit. For these types of situations, a small color video camera (1.5 to 3 inches in diameter) with maximum pres sure depth ratings up to 1,000 feet of water can be used. Figure 131 shows an example of this type of video camera. This video camera can be attached to metal or PVC poles (commonly referred to as push poles) and manually pushed up the conduit. Push poles are normally used for straight sections of conduit. The use of push poles for advancement is generally limited to about 400 feet of conduit length. If bends exist in the conduit, a flexible snake device (s pring steel wir e, coiled wir e, or flexible polypr opylene- jacketed fiberglass push rod) can be used instead of the push poles. A coaxial cable connects the video camer a to a video cas sette recorder and televis ion monitor . Snake devices are generally limited to about 75 to 200 feet of conduit length. 224 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems Figure 130.\u2014Most CCTV i nspecti on equi pment is porta ble and can be carried to condui t access loca tions. The quality and adaptability of CCT V inspection equipment can var y greatly, depending on the requirements of the inspection. Any company or contr actor selected to per form a CCT V ins pection should have a wide range of available equipment for differing site conditions. No CCT V ins pection equipment exis ts that is fully adaptable for all conditions , and a variety of crawler configurations and cameras may be require d. Camer a-crawler inspection equipment is expensive to purchase, operate, and maintain. The envir onment being ins pected is typically harsh and can pose many hazards and obstructions. Although rare, camer a-crawler inspection equipment can become lodged in s mall diameter conduits if adver se offsets or obstructions exist. If camer a-crawler inspection equipment becomes lodged within a conduit, it can partially block the conduit, reducing its discharge capacity. Also, due to the har sh envir onment, this type of inspection equipment can exper ience br eakdown while oper ating within the conduit. The retrieval pr ocess for removing a lodged camer a-crawler can be expens ive and time consuming. If the camer a-crawler inspection equipment becomes stuck in totally inaccessible portions of a conduit, complete abandonment and loss of the equipment is possible. For this reason, the operator of any inspection equipment must be very experienced and have a clear unders tanding of the capabilities and limitations of the Figure 131 .\u2014A small color video camera used for CCTV inspection. 225 Conduits through Embankment Dams equipment. The operator must be very cautious and should not push the equipment beyond retrievable limits . The ability to recognize ins pection limitations is based largely on the operator's skill and prior experience. The operator mus t have a thorough understanding of potential dam safety defects, conduit materials, and obstructions within the conduit. Opera tors must understa nd tha t conduits within embankment dams are not like s ewers, wher e only a limited amount of over burden typically exis ts and where excavation could facilitate camera-crawler retrieval. A conservative approach to inspection is best advised. Experience with CCTV inspection has shown that past conduit design practices did not always allow f or accommodation of equipment us ed for CCT V ins pection. Also, certain conf iguration of entrance and ter minal s tructures may not allow acces s for CCT V ins pection due to exis ting tr ashracks, bends , baffles, etc. The des ign of any new conduit or the modification of an existing conduit should incorporate features to allow for complete ins pection us ing CCT V ins pection equipment. For an example of a conduit ins pection us ing CCT V equipment, s ee the P asture Canyon Dam case history in appendix B. The success of performing a CCTV inspection depends upon the quality of the equipment and the exper ience of the oper ator. A us ually r equires a two-person crew consisting of an operator and cable reel handler. Additional crew member s may be r equired in dif ficult acces s locations . Guidance to cons ider in performing a CCTV inspection includes (Cooper, 2000, pp. 4-5): Light.\u2014The amount of light is critical to the success of the inspection. Without the proper amount, areas of concern cannot be observed clearly enough. Lack of clarity hinders making definitive conclusions as to the integrity of the conduit. Also, the lar ger the diameter of the conduit, the mor e light that is needed. A trial-and-error procedur e may be r equired to obtain s ufficient light intens ity. The ability to vary light intens ity and control glare is an important feature to cons ider. Came ra.\u2014The video camera should be able to pan and tilt and also be capable of looking s traight ahead. Zoom capabilities allow for clos e up viewing. Not all inspections involve horizontal conduits. Inspections of vertical drops are sometimes required. The video camera should be able to accommodate different conduit diameters, shapes, and orientations. Foota ge meter.\u2014A footage meter should be superimposed on the videotape. This meter makes identif ying specific locations within the conduit much eas ier. In lieu of a footage meter, the operator should verbally record on the videotape the location of the camer a-crawler by meas uring the length of cable nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems Compass.\u2014A compas s unit will provide azimuth and inclination readings superimpos ed on the videotape. This will as sist in determining conduit alignment. However, a compas s unit likely will not work in a s teel conduit. Narration.\u2014All inspection videotapes should include narration by the operator. The operator should describe in detail what is being seen. Narration should note any deposits, changes in the slope of the invert, condition of conduit joints , areas of deter ioration, changes in shape, etc. Drawing s and pho tographs.\u2014Copies of all available des ign and/or as -built drawings of the embankment dam and conduit should be onsite during the CCTV inspection for immediate reference and confirmation of details and features observed dur ing the ins pection. Measurements and data co llection.\u2014The inspection and the technical evaluation will be gr eatly enhanced if the f ollowing data ar e collected at the time the CCT V inspection is performed: reservoir water level, any relevant data on nearby piezometer levels, history of past operations, and time/date. Videotape library.\u2014The operator and other inspection personnel should review all previous inspection videotapes (if available) prior to doing the CCT V inspection. This will provide a bas eline reference, s o the rate of any continuing deterioration can be evaluated. An important part of any CCTV inspection is the technical evaluation of the conditions observed during the inspection. A qualified professional engineer experienced in the design and construction of conduits should perform this evaluation. Interpretation of the results of the CCTV inspection should not be left to inexperienced personnel. The correct determination of conditions within the conduit is crucial in unders tanding potential failure modes involved. Many years may pass before the opportunity to perform another CCTV inspection is available. The engineer should prepare a report of findings (R OF), which documents all problem areas observed and recommends future actions. The R OF should also include pictures captured off the videotape or DVD showing areas of concern, a drawing or sketch s howing the limits of the CCT V ins pection, additional informational drawings if needed, and a detailed summary or log of observations that corresponds with time and linear footage on the videotape. Figure 132 shows a picture captured from videotape. Other innovations in ins pection s ystems are under development for sewers and for the oil and gas indus try. These systems may eventually pr ove applicable to conduit inspection. These systems involve s tate-of-the-art las er scanners (digital imaging), and gyroscope technology. Laser scanner systems allow the operator to see the total conduit s urface with color coding of conduit def ects on a digital computer image. 227Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 132.\u2014A joint has sepa rated in the steel pi pe of thi s outlet works. Data processing and report preparation are completed using a manufacturer's proprietary software. Currently, laser scanners are not readily adaptable for conduit inspection, s ince they have s ome difficulties identifying infiltration, corros ion, and conduit ovality. Laser scanners also are limited to conduits in the range of 8 to 24 inches in diameter. Inspections utilizing las er scanners generally cos t 50 to 75 percent more than for CCTV. However, the major benefit of laser scanners is the ability to produce a digital record, which reduces the s ubjective interpretation of results. Computer ized evaluation will gain wider acceptance as a reliable ins pection and evaluation tool as further technological advancements are made (Civil Engineer ing Res earch Foundation, 2001). 9.6 Cleaning of conduits Small, inacces sible conduits are especially vulner able to plugging is sues. Cleaning is usually only an is sue wher e man- entry is not pos sible. If a conduit r equires cleaning, it should only be done after careful consideration of the potential effects on known or suspected deterioration within the conduit. The basic philosophy used in the cleaning of conduits should be to \"do no harm.\" This means a very cautious approach is required for cleaning of conduits. 9.6.1 Reas ons for cleaning Inspection.\u2014Cleaning may be required to allow for operation of CCTV inspection equipment within the conduit. 228 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems Constructio n.\u2014Cleaning of the existing conduit may be required as part of the selected renovation method; see chapter 12 for renovation methods requiring cleaning of the existing conduit. Maintenance .\u2014Cleaning may be required to improve the flow capacity within the conduit due to hard deposits, bacterial growths, sediments, or debris that may have collected in the conduit. Periodic operation of the conduit will flus h out many of these types of collections. However, infrequent operation or nonoperation may allow for continued buildup of these collections. 1. Hard deposits.\u2014If a conduit has not been periodically operated, certain mechanis ms may develop within the conduit. In conduits exper iencing seepage into the conduit thr ough a joint, s olid depos its may develop wher e the seepage water evapor ates. These depos its often contain calcium carbonate, which precipitates out of solution as the mineral calcite. Calcite will form depos its when the calcium ion and bicarbonate ion concentr ations in the water increase to the point wher e they exceed the capacity to dissolve in water. Hard deposits of calcium carbonate precipitate may develop when the s eepage water evapor ates. 2. Bacterial growths .\u2014If a conduit has not been periodically operated, certain bacter ial gr owths may develop within the conduit. Bacterial gr owths are common and can develop under a variety of conditions. Bacterial growth can occur anaerobically (without oxygen) and aerobically (with oxygen). Most of the time, bacter ial gr owths are soft and eas y to remove, but in some situations, these growths can become hard and mineralized. Aerobic bacterial growth can also create hazardous conditions by depleting the oxygen in the air of a conf ined s pace. 3. Sediments and de bris.\u2014If a conduit does not discharge water completely out of the s ystem or if the dis charge channel is adver sely sloped, water may partially or completely s ubmerge the exit portal. If this occurs , sediments and debris can back up into the conduit, resulting in sediment deposits or debris accumulation. 9.6.2 Cleaning methods The impr oper use or the s election of incor rect cleaning equipment may caus e additional damage to a deteriorating conduit and further degrade its structural integrity. The type of conduit ma terial (i.e., concrete, pla stic, or meta l) must be considered in selecting the appropriate cleaning method. Some conduit materials (such as CMP) are much more prone to defects. Cleaning of inaccessible conduits should only be considered after CCTV thoroughly inspects the conduit. If a 229Conduits through Embankment Dams deteriorating conduit is cleaned without the benefit of CCTV inspection, the conduit may become unknowingly damaged. Indications of obstructions within the conduit may include r educed outlet f low capacity, etc. If obstructions are found during the CCTV inspection, the method of cleaning can be evaluated and a pr eferred method s elected. Sometimes , CCT V inspection and cleaning ar e done on the s ame day. Some cleaning s ervices have limited CCTV inspection equipment. Any cleaning should be attempted only in the presence of qualif ied and exper ienced s taff representing the agency/owner of the embankment dam. Complete documentation (including photographs) of all activities at the s ite is highly r ecommended. The success of any conduit cleaning depends upon acces sibility, type of cleaning required, and the cleaning method us ed. A var iety of cleaning methods are available: Flushing .\u2014If debris and sediments are not significant, adequate cleaning may be obtained by merely flushing the conduit with water. Flushing can be accomplished by opening a gate or valve and allowing water to flow through the conduit or by inserting a flexible hose and pumping water into the conduit. In many cas es, volume and low pr essure is all that is needed to adequately clean the conduit. Pressure wa shing.\u2014Pressure washing (f igure 133) involves the us e of a flexible hose a ttached to a meta l nozzle tha t directs jets of wa ter out in front of it to loosen debris and sediments in the conduit. The jet is created by a shaped restriction in the f low channel that f orces water to acceler ate and conver (pr essure) into kinetic ener gy (velocity). The nozzle is propelled forward by reverse angle jets. The reverse angle jets also push debris and s ediments backwar ds towar d the end of the conduit, wher e the f lexible hose exits. Pressure washing is best sui ted where biomasses or mi neral encrustation ar e to be r emoved. The pressure selected f or cleaning s hould f ully consider the condition of the types of conduit material, age, and type of joints. The lowes t pos sible pr essure that ef fectively cleans the conduits should be us ed. The jets on the nozzle should be angled no more than about 30 degrees, so the jets are not aimed directly at the conduit wall. The nozzle should be kept rotating and moving and should not be allowed to remain in one spot during jetting. Mechanical .\u2014Mechanical cleaning utilizes rotating brus hes. Cleaning pig.\u2014Cleaning pigs have wire brushes to scrape the walls of the conduit. A variety of brushes are available, depending on the type of cleaning required and the exis tence of any coatings on the inter ior surface of the conduit. Cleaning pigs are gener ally available in diameter s up to 48 inches . 230 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems Figure 133.\u2014Pressur e washing cleaning head. Again, it should be strongly emphasized that any cleaning should be given considerable thought bef ore proceeding, to avoid caus ing any damage, or worsening existing def ects within the conduit. In some situations , minor cracks or joints exper iencing s eepage s eal thems elves calcite depos ition. This process occur s when calcite pr ecipitates out of solution and forms a deposit. Deposition may occur as the seepage evaporates, leaving the calcite behind. Calcite depos its typically mineralize and harden over time. Figure 134 shows a conduit joint where calcite deposition has sealed a minor leak. If inspection s hows locations within a conduit wher e this has occur red, cleaning with high pr essure could r emove enough of the calcite depos ition to caus e seepage to begin again. This possibility needs to be carefully cons idered prior to performing any cleaning operations within the conduit. 9.7 Forensic investigation To better understand and to provide further knowledge concerning the failure mechanisms resulting from the internal erosion or backward erosion piping within an embankment dam, forensic investigation should be considered. Although traditionally a forens ic inves tigation is conducted to es tablis h the failure mechanis m for legal cas es, a detailed inves tigation can be very helpful in determining the caus es of failures and to provide ins ight into des ign changes to reduce failures in the future. For projects wher e a failed conduit is being r emoved and r eplaced, clos e coordination between des igners, embankment dam owner , and the contr actor will be required to pr eserve the s oil adjacent to the conduit. The inves tigation team s hould 231 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 134.\u2014Calcite depo sition has sealed thi s leak at a condui t joint. consist of exper ienced geotechnical and civil engineer s, geologis ts, surveyors, and construction personnel. All anticipated items of interest (e.g., voids) should be clearly communicated to all par ties involved pr ior to the commencement of embankment excavation. Test pits are usually excavated along the conduit, extending a specified depth below the bottom of the conduit. The contractor must take care to prevent damage to in-situ conditions before the investigation team can document them. Figure 135 shows an outlet works conduit excavation during a forensic investigation. Figure 136 shows how polyurethane grout flowed through the backfill s urrounding an outlet works conduit during joint s ealing operations . Close coor dination between the f orensic team and contr actor were required in or der to pr eserve this information f or study. Documentation of the conditions encountered is essential to be able to recreate the events lea ding to the fa ilure. A surveyor with a transit, theodolite or tota l station, and one or more assistants with survey rod or reflector target should be available to precisely document the location (position and elevation) of items of interest. Numerous photographs should be taken, even of items that do not appear to have contr ibuted to the f ailure in cas e they ar e needed later , since the s oil structure surrounding the conduit will likely be des troyed by the inves tigation and the information will be forever los t, if not carefully documented. A JHA should be prepared for all onsite forensic investigations. See section 9.4 for details on preparing a JHA. For details of a forens ic inves tigation, s ee the Annapolis Mall Dam case history in appendix B. 232 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems Figure 135.\u2014An outlet wor ks condui t is being excavated dur ing a forensic investigation. The top of a n antiseep colla r is exposed on the left si de of the fi gure. Figure 136.\u2014Clos e coor dination betw een the for ensic team and contr actor allowed for careful study of how polyur ethane grout injected i nto the deter iorated joi nts of a condui t flows thr ough surrounding backfill. In thi s case, the forensic investigation showed the injection of grout was rela tively successful i n sealing the jo ints of the condui t. 233 Conduits through Embankment Dams 9.8 Instrumentation and monitoring Instrumentation and monitoring are performed for three distinct reasons: 1. To aid in the evaluation of water pressure conditions surrounding a conduit and detect s igns of a problem (i.e., f irst identif ication). Key detection elements include: a. Visual monitoring for unusual settlements or deformations above the conduit b. Visual monitor ing for seepage emer ging in or near the downs tream end of the conduit c. Inspection of the interior of the conduit d. Structural measurement points in the conduit (where possible) e. Embankment measurement points in the vicinity of the conduit alignment 2. To gain a better understanding of an already detected problem for use in evaluation and design of a remediation 3. To monitor embankment and foundation water pressures during and following conduit remediation Instrumentation in a conduit or embankment dam furnishes data to determine if the structure is functioning as intended and to provide a continuing s urveillance of the structure to war n of developments that could endanger the s afety of the embankment dam facility. Conduits are not normally ins trumented unles s there is a specific concern due to known adverse foundation conditions or other unusual circumstances . The means and methods available to monitor an emer gency event or condition that could lead to a embankment dam f ailure include a wide s pectrum of instruments and pr ocedur es from ver y simple to ver y complex. The need f or instrumentation designed for monitoring potential and/or existing deficiencies at existing emba nkment da ms must ta ke into a ccount the threa t to huma n life a nd property downstream of the dam. Thus, the extent and nature of the instrumentation depends not only on the complexity of the conduit and embankment dam, and the extent of the def iciency being monitor ed and the s ize of the reservoir, but also on the potential for loss of life and property damage downs tream of the dam (FEMA, 1987, p. 51; Reclamation, 1987b, pp. 1-3). 234 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems An instrumentation program should involve instruments and evaluation methods that are as simple and s traightforward as the project and s ituation will allow. Instruments selected f or use should be accur ate, pr ecise, and pr ovide f or repeatability of meas urements . Beyond that, the des igner and embankment dam owner should make a definite commitment to an ongoing monitoring program. If not, the ins tallation of ins truments will probably be was ted. Increas ed knowledge of any def iciency and emer gency condition of the embankment dam acquir ed thr ough an instrumentation and monitoring program is extremely useful in determining the cause of the def iciency, the neces sary or probable r emedy, and monitor ing dur ing and following corrective actions. Involvement of qualified personnel in the design, installation, monitoring, and evaluation of an instrumentation system is of prime importance to developing and achieving a successful and meaningful instrumentation and monitoring program. A wide var iety of devices and pr ocedur es are available f or use in monitor ing the behavior of and deficiencies along a conduit and at an embankment dam. Table 9.1 provides a listing of potential def iciencies and conditions and their caus es that could be encountered along the alignment of a conduit. The table also provides a brief description of wher e the condition could be encounter ed and the ins trumentation that could be used to monitor the condition. Additional discussion of each meas urement is provided in the f ollowing s ections . Most of these meas urements are typically done for embankment dam concerns . However, there is some applicability to conduits. Further information or instrumentation and monitoring is available on ASCE's Guidelines fo r Instrumentatio n and M easurements fo r Monitoring Dam Perfo rmance (2000). 9.8.1 Structural deformation Structural deformation of a conduit could lead to crack development or joints opening up along the alignment of the conduit. These def iciencies could r esult in the potential for internal erosion or backward erosion piping of embankment dam materials into or a long the exterior of the outlet conduit. In the ca se of wa ter seeping into the conduit through open joints or cracks, an unprotected exit point for the seepage exis ts, which could allow f or the inter nal erosion or backwar d erosion piping of embankment dam materials into the conduit. For pressurized conduits, open joints or cracks in the conduit could allow for the saturation of the embankment dam materials around the conduit under a high seepage gradient condition, which could also lead to the internal erosion or backward erosion piping of embankment materials. Structural deformations may result from foundation settlement, lateral deformation of the embankment slopes above or below the conduit, or a collaps e of the conduit due to a s tructural def ect in the conduit or growth processes within concrete, usually resulting from alkali-aggregate reaction. 235 Conduits through Embankment Dams Table 9.1 .\u2014Instruments used for monitoring of cond uits (ASCE, 2000) Property measured Cause Measurem ent location Typical instruments Vertical- settlem ent Joints, alignment Strain gauges, extensom eter, survey profi les Structura movement Joints, survey profi les Expansion- autogenous g rowth (alkali-aggre gate reaction) Any location of interest Strain gauges, ex tensom eter Uplift pressures Shallow structure and high groundwa ter Within embankment da m Within foundation Piezometers, observa tion wells Piezometers, observa tion Internal erosion or backwa rd erosi on piping Any location of interest Calibrated container, weir, flume, flow meter Horiz. and vert. movements Internal erosion or backwa rd erosi on piping Any location of interest Survey, staking, probing Water quality Internal erosion or backwa rd erosi on piping Any location of interest Turbidity meter, jar samples Reservo ir water level and flows -Reservoir or outlet channel Elevation gauge Structural def ormation of the conduit can s ometimes be first detected by def ects noted on the surface of the embankment dam in the form of depressions, bulges, and cracks. For guidance on horizontal and vertical movement of embankment dams , see section 9.8.4. 9.8.2 Uplift pressures Where the conduit is shallow and groundwater is high, uplift pressures on the conduit may be s ufficient to the pus h the conduit or associated s tructures upwar d. 236 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems This movement could cause cracks to develop or joints to open up in the conduit similarly as discussed for structural deformations of conduits. Conduits in sandy and silty soils also could be s usceptible to damage, if the s oils are liquefiable. If this condition is suspected along the alignment of a conduit, instrumentation, such as observation wells, could be placed near the conduit alignment. Installation of instruments to measure uplift pressures cannot be relied upon as the sole means of detection of these problems. Rather, instruments to measure pore pressure should only be placed as a means of providing information on the general water pressure conditions at the location of interest. If piezometers are installed after the conduit and embankment dam have been constructed, caution should be used in considering drilling clos e to a conduit, as low s tress zones with the potential to hydraulically fracture often exist as a result of the structure. In a zoned embankment dam, locating the instrument in a zone other than the core should be considered. Installation of instruments to measure pore pressure resulting from internal erosion or backward erosion piping cannot be relied upon as the sole means of detection of these problems. Rather, instruments to measure pore pressure should only be placed as a means of providing information on the general water pressure conditions within the embankment dam. Designers should note that a trend is growing in the indus try to eliminate the installation of instrumentation within the cores of embankment dams during construction. The performance of embankment materials is well understood, so there is little need to r epeat pas t research. Also, it is very unlikely that the ins trument will be placed in the correct place to detect a chance problem. Furthermore, it is recognized that the mere act of ins talling the ins trument can advers ely affect the quality of the embankment dam. Vertical risers associated with cables and tubing can disrupt the proper flow of compaction equipment. Instrumentation trenches can potentially intr oduce f laws that could lead to concentr ated leakage. Installing ins truments in the cores of exis ting embankment dams to detect particular problems should s till be cons idered. The instrument can be placed within the embankment dam by drilling techniques , but s pecific techniques that limit the potential for fracturing the embankment dam s hould be employed. Drilling into the embankment dam with techniques that use water or air to remove cuttings should be avoided, becaus e blockages within the drill holes have been known to caus e the buildup of high fluid pres sures leading to fractures in the earthfill. For guidance on drilling within embankment dams , see section 14.3.1. 9.8.3 Seepage quantity Seepage along a conduit or through an embankment dam is a valuable indicator of the condition and continuing level of performance of an embankment dam. 237 Conduits through Embankment Dams Particular attention should be given to seepage exiting ground conduits and the quantity of seepage f lowing out of conduits . The quantity of seepage enter ing a seepage collection s ystem is normally dir ectly r elated to the level of the water in the reservoir. Any s udden change in the quantity of seepage collected without appar ent cause, such as a corresponding change in the reservoir level or a heavy rainfall, could indicate a s eepage pr oblem. Similar ly, when the s eepage becomes cloudy or discolored, contains increased quantities of sediment or changes radically in chemical content, a serious internal erosion or backward erosion piping problem may be developing. Moisture or seepage at new or unplanned locations on the downstream slope or below the embankment dam als o may indicate a s eepage pr oblem. Seepage should be monitored regularly to determine if it is increas ing, decreas ing, or remaining constant as the reservoir level fluctuates. A flow rate not changing relative to a reservoir water level can be an indication of a clogged drain, internal erosion or backward erosion piping, or internal cracking of the embankment dam. Seepage may be meas ured with weir s of any s hape, s uch as a V- notch, r ectangular , or trapezoidal; f lumes , such as the arshall f lume; water exiting a pipe meas ured with a stopwatch and bucket; and f lowmeter s. When a new s eepage ar ea that pr oduces meas urable f low is identif ied at an embankment dam, the s eepage s hould be monitored and, in some cases, measured. A qualified engineer should promptly evaluate each new s eepage ar ea. In some situations , a change in the s eepage r egime precedes failures. The flow should f irst be conf ined and dir ected away f rom the embankment dam by excavating drainage channels or ditches. Then, the quantity of seepage can be meas ured by cr eating a lar ge enough dr op in the dr ainage channel to install a pipe, weir or flume or to facilitate the meas urement of the flow by means of a stopwatch and bucket. The integr ity of the s eepage meas urement devices should be maintained s o that s eepage does not bypas s the device and the device is kept clear of obstructions. Points wher e seepage meas urement devices are added ar e often a good location to meas ure the amount of sediment that may be car ried in the s eepage. Sediment transport is often a sign of internal erosion or backward erosion piping failure modes . Providing an area adjacent to a weir where water flow is stilled can allow some of the sediment in the wa ter to fa ll out a nd collect with time. Seepage into conduits should als o be monitor ed wher e it is deter mined to be importa nt. Note tha t if the seepa ge into a conduit is tra nsporting ma terial, operations of the conduit may be transporting material out of the conduit. Frequently, the highes t seepage gr adient at a s ite is associated with s eepage into a nonpressurized conduit. For this reason, inspection of the conduit is important. The internal erosion and backward erosion piping processes are frequently intermittent, a nd in ma ny ca ses, the tra nsport of ma terials in the seepa ge is spora dic. Inspection should look for signs of deposits, as well as clarity of the seepage. 238 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems 9.8.4 Horizontal or vertical movements Movements in the embankment dam or foundation have been known to damage conduits and create potential internal erosion backward erosion piping conditions. On s oft, stiff, or weak foundations , it is important to realize that the conduit will be deformed over its length as it follows the deformations of the foundation. Conduits within large embankment dams have also experienced distress on rock foundations over areas wher e the f oundation s tiffness varies greatly due to the pr esence of shears, faults, or soft zones. Designs should account for these conditions, and consideration should be given to the pos sibility of dis tress in monitoring for horizontal and vertical movement. When monitor ing a cr ack in the conduit, cr ack meter s are also used to deter mine if the cr ack is formed due to temper ature and s hrinkage, or due to s lope movement in the embankment dam. Movements of embankment dams are generally caused by stresses induced by reservoir water pressure, unstable slopes (low strength), low foundation strength, settlement, thrust due to a rching a ction, expa nsion resulting from tempera ture heave resulting from hydrostatic uplift pressures. Monitoring displacements can be helpful in understanding the normal behavior of an embankment dam and in determining if a potentially hazardous condition is developing. The displacements, both horizontal and vertical, are more commonly meas ured on the s urface of the embankment dam. Measuring dis placements of points on the surface is usually accomplished by conventional surveying methods and the installation of permanent surveying points/monuments. External vertical and horizontal movements are measured on the surface of embankment dams through the use of level and position surveys of reference points. Reference points may be monuments or designated permanent points on the embankment dam crest, slopes, or toe of the embankment dam or on an appurtenant structure. For saturated areas on the downstream slope of an embankment dam, the perimeter of the hole or wet ar ea should be s urveyed to deter mine the extent of the ar ea. As a minimum, the perimeter of the hole or wet area can be staked out with metal fence posts or wooden s takes (figure 137) and the length, width and location of the wet area recorded and photographed for future reference. For saturated areas on the embankment dam f ace, the degr ee of wetnes s should als o be es timated and r ecorded, such as \"boggy,\" or \"surface moist but firm underfoot.\" Any flow of water from the wet area or into a sinkhole should be measured, if possible, and/or estimated and recorded. See s ection 11.3 f or guidance on actions involving s inkholes . Detecting s urface evidence of s lope ins tability is of primary importance. Such evidence includes slope bulging, s agging cr ests, foundation heave at or beyond the toe, and lateral spreading of foundations and embankments. During the operation of 239 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 137.\u2014The perimeter of a we t area at the downstream toe of an embankment da m located wi th wooden sta kes. the embankment dam, measurements of lateral transitional movements from forces caused by pool loading, reservoir drawdown, gravity, and the effects of seepage pressures are required to help evaluate safe performance of the embankment dam. The measured internal movements of embankment dams consist principally of vertical movements and relative horizontal movements caused mainly by the low shearing strength or the long term creep strain of the foundation or embankment materials. Internal move ments generally result in e xternal move ment of the embankment dam's crest or side slopes. Internal displacement-monitoring plans can be very complex and expensive. Internal movement-monitoring devices consist of baseplates , inclinometer s, tiltmeter s, extens ometer s, and s hear strips. In the event of an emer gency s ituation at a dams ite, some relatively s imple devices can be installed to monitor embankment dam movement, such as cracks and slides. If a small crack is observed on the embankment dam, it may be very important to know if the cr ack enlar ges. An eas y method of monitor ing the cr ack is to dr ive steel rebar or wooden stakes on both sides of the crack to monitor additional separation and vertical displacement on one side of the crack relative to the other side. Also, the ends of the cr ack s hould be s taked to deter mine if the cr ack is lengthening. This scheme can be used to monitor both longitudinal and transverse cracking. 240 Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems Another special situation, which would require immediate attention, is the development of a slide on one of the embankment dam slopes. A simple yet reliable method to measure movement of the slide area would be an alignment method. A strong wir e is stretched acr oss the s lide and tied to pins outs ide of the s lide ar ea. At intervals along the wir e, pins are driven into the s lide mas s. If additional movement occur s, the amount is directly deter mined by meas uring the dis tance between the pins and wire. If a def ect is suspected in a conduit, an ins pection us ing man- entry or CCT V methods is required. 9.8.5 Water quality Seepage comes into contact with var ious miner als within the s oil and r ock in and around the embankment dam and its foundation. This can cause two problems: the chemical dissolution of a natural rock, such as gypsum, or the internal erosion of soil. Dissolution of minerals can often be detected by comparing chemical analyses of reservoir water and s eepage water . Such tes ts are site specific; for example, in a limestone area, one would look for calcium and carbonates, and in a gypsum area, calcium and sulfates. Other tests, such as pH, might provide useful information on chemical dis solution. Internal erosion and backward erosion piping can be detected by comparing the turbidity of reservoir water with that of seepage water . An incr ease in tur bidity may indicate internal erosion and backward erosion piping of the materials. A method of compar ing obs ervations is to collect a s ample of the water in a lar ge glas s jar, which is marked with the date and location the s ample was collected and r etained f or future comparison. Another jar should be used for the next water sampling. Glass jars should be filled periodically with the s eepage flow and s et aside to allow for any material to settle out. By compa ring ja rs, one ca n determine if ma terial is moving and if it is increas ing. However, this method does have s ome limitations , since material transport is not usually continuous and can be episodic. For certain tests, such as iron bacter ia, the s ample mus t be kept r efrigerated until tes ted. The frequency of instrument readings or making observations at an embankment dam depends on s everal factors and could include the f ollowing items : Relative hazard to life and downstream property damage that the failure of the embankment dam represents The importance of the instrument in detecting a failure mode The nature and urgency of an emergency condition being investigated and monitored at the damsite 241 Conduits through Embankment Dams Height or size of the embankment dam Volume of water impounded by the embankment dam Age of the embankment dam History of the performance of an instrument Frequency and amount of water level fluctuation in the reservoir Frequency of staff visits for other reasons, such as operations In gener al, as each of the above f actors increases, the f requency of the monitor ing should also increase. For example, very frequent (even daily) readings should be taken during the firs t filling of a res ervoir and more frequent readings should be taken dur ing emer gency events and high water levels in the r eservoir under storm and seismic events. As a rule of thumb, simple visual observations should be made during each vis it to the dams ite. In the event of an emer gency at the dams ite under potential dam failure, and/or imminent dam failure, the frequency of the instrumentation monitor ing and vis ual obs ervation could var y from weekly to daily to hourly or less, depending on the nature and urgency of the situation. Lights are frequently employed during critical times to facilitate nighttime obs ervations . In almos t all cas es, the cons equences would be gr eates t if failure occur red at night. Document ation and r ecording of the instrument ation readings and dat a and vis ual observations are very important in the monitoring and evaluation of an emergency situation at a damsite. The documentation should include tabulations of the instrumentation readings and data, written documentation of the visual observations and findings, and photographs of key elements or features of the investigation at the site dur ing the occur rence of an emer gency. The documentation s hould include the instrumentation description, location and readings, the date and time of the readings and obs ervations , the r eservoir water surface and tail water levels , the r eleases being made from the embankment dam, weather conditions, evaluation of the present condition of the embankment dam and comparison of previous information, and the recommendation f or monitor ing and/or remedial meas ures to cor rect the def iciency. Proper training of those who are to inspect and take readings at the embankment dam is very important. Training will ens ure that the ins pection s taff are familiar with the proper method to read the instruments, what other data and information from the site is necessary, what anomalous behavior might look like, how to report normal and unus ual conditions , and what s teps need to be taken in an emer gency. 242Chapter 9\u2014I nspection and Assessment of Conduit-Related Problems 9.8.6 Reservoir w ater lev el and flow s The reservoir water surface level is a key item to r ecord when meas uring other instrumentation at a damsite and should be measured and recorded each time the embankment dam is visually inspected, and when other instrumentation is observed or read. The reservoir water level is also used when evaluating the inf ormation provided by the other instruments at the site. For instance, the amount of seepage exiting the embankment dam as it relates to res ervoir water level is often crucial. A patter n of increasing seepage at the s ame reservoir level is caus e for concer n. Water levels may be meas ured by s imple elevation gauges , such as a staff gauge or number s painted on permanent, fixed structures in the reservoir, or by complex water-sensing devices. Reservoir flow release quantities are often computed from the depth of flow in the conduit or exit channel or by predetermined conduit discharge rating tables/curves. During a n emergency, it is importa nt to monitor the wa ter level in the reservoir and the downstream pool regularly, along with the quantity of water being releas ed from the embankment dam's outlet works and s pillway. 243 Conduits through Embankment Dams 244 Chapter 10 Evaluation by Geophysical and Nondestructive Testing Geophysical and nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques can be used to investigate the condition of a conduit directly or indirectly by providing data on the condition of the conduit and the s urrounding embankment dam. These techniques are used to detect flaws, defects, deterioration, and other anomalies that could lead to a failure and do not disturb the feature being evaluated or tested. The most common techniques used include: Seismic tomography Self potential (SP) Electrical res istivity Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) Sonar Ultrasonic pulse echo and ultrasonic velocity Mechanical and s onic caliper Radiography Surface hardness Depending on the particular situation, some techniques are more effective than others. The selection of the applicable technique(s) requires evaluation of the type of information needed, the size and the nature of the project, the conditions existing at the s ite, and any impacts that may r esult to the s tructure from per forming the technique. These techniques require trained and experienced personnel to perform and inte rpret the results. The various a pplic ations for the se technique s are summar ized in table 10.1. The following s ections briefly discuss these techniques . 245 Table 10. 1.\u2014Geophysi cal and NDT techniques Investigation Problem method s identification Comme nts Seismic tomog raphy Voids along outside Best result s when i nside of conduit is accessible. of the c onduit Good results may or may not b e obtaine d, if sources and rec eivers are on outside.

Conduits through Embankment Dams 246 Chapter 10\u2014Ev aluation by Geophysical and Nondestructiv e Testing Additional information on nondestructive testing is available in Molhotra and Carino (2004), USACE's Evaluation and Repair of Concrete Structures (1995b), and ACI (1998a). 10.1 Seismic tomography The seismic tomography method (figure 138) is a noninvasive geophysical method similar to methods applied in medicine, s uch as ultras ound, computerized axial tomogra phy (C AT) sca ns, and ma gnetic resona nce ima ging (MR I). Seismic tomography uses elastic waves produced by seismic sources implanted around or within bor eholes in the embankment dam. Receiver s (geophones or acceler ometer s) installed at other locations on the s tructure record the gener ated waves . Seismic tomogr aphy us es the s ame pr ocessing technique as in the medical f ield, but the image is not as detailed, s ince s ources and r eceiver s cannot be placed at all s ides of the embankment dam, and becaus e the f requencies propagated ar e much lower than thos e used in medical imaging. However , surface-mounted s ources and receiver s may be s ufficient to dis cover potential pr oblems within the s tructure of the embankment dam. Target detection depends strongly on the ability to trans mit and receive high f requency s eismic ener gy thr ough dimens ions of the s uspected tar get, the location of the phr eatic s urface, and whether the Figure 138.\u2014Sei smic tom ography bei ng used on a n embankment da m. Photo cour tesy of UR S Corporation. 247 Conduits through Embankment Dams suspected voids or stopes are air- or water -filled. Placement of sources and r eceiver s inside the conduit, when acces sible, can impr ove the technique. The parameters recorded can provide important information about different features that may damage the embankment dam's structure, such as fractur es, low dens ity regions, saturated zones, and high stress regions. The results may be presented as cross-section images (figures 139 and 140) of compr ession (P - [primary]) wave velocity, or of seismic wave attenuation. These properties may be correlated to other engineering parameters of interest, such as possible fractured zones, and potential void areas . For an embankment dam in Maryland (Schaub, 1996, the tomogra phic of the earthfill around a CMP s pillway conduit ranged from 65 percent to nearly 100 percent. The areas with the lowes t inter preted dens ities were found to be under , along, and above the conduit. For concr ete, high compr ession (P -) and s hear (S- [secondar y]) wave velocities indicate competent concr ete. Lower velocity values may indicate cr acking, deterioration caused by ice and other weathering, alkali reaction, or defects. 10.1.1 Spectral analysis of surface waves Recently developed geophys ical pr ocedur es called Spectr al Analys is of Sur face Waves (SASW) and Multichannel Analys is of Surface Waves (MASW) meas ure the \"dispersion\" of s urface wave velocities to evaluate material properties . (Billington and B asinger, 2004, p. 4; Park et al., 2001; and Miller et al., 1999). These techniques , termed \"indirect methods,\" since the measurements can be made from one side of a structure, provide es timates of mater ial properties aver aged over relatively lar ge distances . The SASW/M ASW techniques can be us ed on a lar ge scale to evaluate embankment dams, such as for locating possible voids or potential seepage zones along a conduit (Stokoe, 1999, p. 3). On a s maller scale, thes e techniques can be us ed to evaluate the quality of conduit materials, such as concrete deterioration and loss of wall thickness due to cor rosion. Use of surface wave data is a power ful technique that allows meas urement of soft layers beneath har der layer s. This means that SASW/M ASW may be able to detect possible voids in the backfill adjacent to a conduit by making meas urements from inside of the conduit. (In comparison, the seismic refraction technique generally cannot be used to locate softer layers under harder layers.) The basis of the methods is measurement of the \"dispersion\" of R ayleigh type surface waves (USACE, 1995c, p. 3- 24). Essentially, s urface waves of different wave 248 Chapter 10\u2014Ev aluation by Geophysical and Nondestructiv e Testing Figure 139.\u2014Seismic tomography profile along failed CMP spillway conduit in an embankment da m. Figure 140.\u2014Typi cal secti on from seismic tom ography used to identify voids along the outside of a CMP spillway conduit in an embankment da m. 249 Conduits through Embankment Dams lengths (frequencies) propagate at different velocities through nonhomogeneous materials. This va riation in velocity is rela ted to the shea r wave velocity a nd thus shear modulus (Shaw, 2003). Different equipment is used depending on whether the SASW/MASW technique is to be used for geotechnical analysis of soil (to depths of 3 feet to 300 feet), or for structural evaluation of concrete. The equipment generally consists of two or more geophones, a hammer or other impact device for generating vibrations, and a seismograph or other data collection unit. Higher wave frequencies and close geophone spacing are used for shallow inves tigations , and lower frequencies with wider spacing ar e used for deeper inves tigations . The field data ar e later processed with s pecialized s oftware, such as WinSASW, developed by the Geotechnical Engineering Center of the University of Texas at Austin, or SurfSeis, developed by the Kansas Geological Survey. 10.2 Self potential Self potentia l (sometimes referred to a s strea ming potentia l or SP) (figure 141), meas ures the electr ical potentials (or voltages ) that exis t in the gr ound or within an embankment dam. Flowing water naturally generates these potentials as a consequence of the s eparation of ions in the s eepage water itself. SP is cons idered to be the only geophysical method capable of direct detection of seepage (Corwin, 2002). Other geophysical methods, such as resistivity, infer the existence of seepage based on other measured parameters. Theoretically, it is possible to meas ure thes e potentials and pr edict s eepage anomalies, such as along a conduit within the embankment dam, up to several hundr ed feet deep. However , the technique is not widely applied, and f ew people or contractors can expertly interpret the data. In addition, the measured potential (usually on the order of tens of millivolts ) in any area can vary with other in-s itu parameter s, and with man- induced voltages . Existing pr ocedur es were developed f or the USACE's Water ways Exper iment Station and published in 1989 (USACE, 1989), and also for the Canadian Electricity Associa tion Da m Sa fety Interest Group (C orwin, 2002). SP interpreta tion a nd modeling computer programs are beginning to be developed along the lines of existing programs available in other geophysical disciplines, such as resistivity and seismic methods. Canadian Electricity Association Technology, Inc. has published a series of DOS program codes (Corwin, 2002) and the University of British Columbia has available a modeling procedure that runs under Visual ModFlow, and models the SP response 250 Chapter 10\u2014Ev aluation by Geophysical and Nondestructiv e Testing Figure 141.\u2014Collecti ng self potenti al (SP) da ta on the cr est of a n embankment da m in Virginia to tra ce the source of observed seepa ge. The 75-ft hi gh embankment da m had a sinkhole, a sand boi l, and sev eral seepage points on the downstream face. This information was used in complement with electrical resistivity imagin g data.

Self potential meas urements are affected by s oil mois ture, resistivity, temper ature, and other in situ parameters. Therefore, the SP technique should be combined with other methods , such as resistivity or temper ature meas urement. 10.3 Electrical resistivity Electrical resistivity technology is relatively well developed and can be a very effective tool f or locating lar ge bur ied metal tar gets, and other highly electr ically resistive or highly conductive targets (Ward, 1990) . The technique, involving an array of electr odes that meas ure the dis tribution of voltage applied to the gr ound, has been us ed to inves tigate s ome embankment dams . However , small changes in measured data can result in ve ry diffe rent inte rpretations. Resistivity interpretations are nonunique, and should be constrained by independent data. Other field parameters (permeability, dis solved minerals , temperature) may need to be meas ured at the s ame time. The method is sensitive to inter ference f rom near by metal objects (such as pipes and wires within the embankment dam, or overhead wires and fences). 251 Conduits through Embankment Dams One- or two-dimensional, or tomographic software can be used to process the data, which can be displayed as color plots of resistivity versus depth. Currently, available field equipment is capable of obtaining and automatically processing large numbers of resistivity meas urements , regardless of data quality. Automatic pr ocessing can lead to misinterpretation of the data, if the operator does not recognize the problem, or is not familiar with nonuniquenes s effects in conducting res istivity s Ground-penetrating radar Ground- electr omagnetic ener gy to penetrate below the ground surface (figure 142). An antenna is used to transmit a short duration pulse, which travels through the air and the subsurface until it is reflected back by a change in the dielectr ical pr operties of the mater ial being imaged. The resulting r eflections are displayed in s ounding or section f ormat, with s ections being the far more common display mode. If the GPR profiles are conducted on a close spacing, the resulting data can be treated in a data volume manner, allowing arbitrary slices through a three-dimensional data mass. This three-dimensional technique can be labor intensive to acquire and process. GPR can be used to locate possible void, stope, or incipient sinkhole areas. However, the depth of penetration of radar waves in soils and concrete depends strongly upon the electrical resistivity of the material in question. Saline pore water and clay-rich soils can severely limit this depth of penetration. Metals are opaque to radar ener gy, so complete r adar wave r eflection occur s at metal s urfaces, such as steel conduit and rebar. Soils or concrete behind s uch metallic objects will have shadow zones or other absence of data. Figure 142.\u2014Conducti ng a ground-penetr ating radar survey across dam crest to locate voids beneath roadway and spillway. Photo courtesy Schna bel Eng ineering. 252 Chapter 10\u2014Ev aluation by Geophysical and Nondestructiv e Testing Known void eas are extr emely us eful in \"calibr ating\" a GP R survey at a par ticular site. Lacking known void areas , core drilling or other direct ins pection methods are highly desirable to aid in the GPR data interpretation. GPR data profiles can be difficult to interpret properly, if no site \"ground truth\" is available. Figure 143 shows a core hole being drilled to reveal voids behind the concrete, and figure 144 shows an example of GPR profiles along a conduit invert. Becaus e the r adar waves travel equally well in all dir ections , GPR may be us ed to image from the ins ide of a (nonmetallic) conduit outwards , along crown, s pringlines , and invert. Modern GPR equipment is commonly mounted on a cart or pole to allow imaging in the r equired direction. Note that s teel well cas ings, communication cables , metal buildings , over head wir es, and other cultur al features can caus e anomalous-looking radar profiles. The GPR interpreter must be aware of the locations of such features at the s ite. 10.5 Sonar For inundated conduits with a heavy suspended sediment load and very poor visibility, three-dimens ional real-time imaging s onar is advantageous . A rotating sonar transducer mounted on a s led, cr awler vehicle, or ROV can be us ed to s can and record the condition of a conduit (Sonex Corporation, 2002). Since the times Figure 143.\u2014A core hole i s being drilled to revea l voids behi nd the concr ete in this condui t. 253 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 144.\u2014GPR profi les along a condui whi on pa tterns are associated with concr ete under lain by voids in drill holes return to the tra nsducer (through a ir or wa ter) a re a function of the dis tance that the puls e travels , it is possible to pr ecisely meas ure the distance to the conduit s urface. When pr ocessed by a computer , thous ands of these meas urements can be us ed to gener ate a map (f igure 145) of the condition (deflection, joint size, depth of deterioration, etc.) of the conduit. The precision of the system is such that measurements of fractions of an inch can be made. The sonic velocity can var y with temper ature and humidity, and calibr ation is required prior to commencing with the ins pection. The accur acy of the meas urements depends upon the calibration. The sonar can also be used in navigating the transporting unit within the conduit. Recent impr ovements in this technology allowed the USACE to inves tigate the condition of a conduit without unwater ing it. A computer processed signals received from sensors mounted on an R OV to generate three-dimensional images. The user can manipulate the images on the s creen in r eal time to change the obs ervational point of view via gr aphics software. Thus, the gr aphics software allows the us er to 254 Chapter 10\u2014Ev aluation by Geophysical and Nondestructiv e Testing Figure 145.\u2014A rotating sona r transducer mounted on a sled ca n be pulled through a condui t to m easure and record changes in dimensions along the condui t.

Features that are not visible from the camer a's view angle can become r eadily appar ent (B ritzman and Hans en, 2002, velocity and f requency content of acous tic puls es of energy through metallic (i.e., CMP) and nonmetallic (e.g., concrete) materials . Piezoelectr ic transducers are pas sed thr ough the s tructure using a \"s mart pig\" device or are attached to the s tructure to tr ansmit and r eceive the puls es. These methods gener ally us e a source with known impuls e char acteristics, so that a transfer function can be computed between the input and the meas ured output (receiver ) signal. By examining typical and nontypical (anomalous ) velocity and frequency infor mation, cor relations may be es tablis hed between s ound and poor concrete conditions, and the corresponding acoustic signatures. 255 Conduits through Embankment Dams Gener ally, higher pulse velocities indicate good quality mater ial, while decr eased velocities or poor return signals (decreased high frequencies) indicate poor quality, such as voids, cracks, or deterioration. A large number of transducers used around the circumference of the conduit will improve the accuracy and the res ulting image resolution. The puls e-velocity method is widely us ed and has provided reliable in s itu delineations of the extent and severity of cracks, areas of deterioration, and general assessments of the condition of concr ete structures for many year s. The equipment can penetrate thick concrete sections with the aid of amplifiers, is easily portable, and has a high data acquisition-to-cost ratio. Although most applications of the pulse-velocity method have been under dry conditions, the transducers can be water proofed for under water surveys. Tests have s hown that the puls e-echo s ystem is capable of delineating sound concrete, concrete of questionable quality, and deteriorated concrete, as well as delaminations, voids, reinforcing steel, and other objects within concr ete. Also, the s ystem can be us ed to deter mine the thicknes s of a concrete s ection in which only one s urface is acces sible. The system will work on vertical or horizontal s urfaces. However , the pr esent system is limited to a thicknes s of about 1.5 f eet with only one s ide acces sible. For maximum us e of this system, the operator should have had considerable experience using the system and interpreting the res ults (USACE, 1995b, p. 2-17). The pulse echo is limited to about a 1 foot thickness. The pulse-echo method is a variation of the pulse-velocity method and is best suited for characterizing voids and cracks parallel to the conduit s urface. The puls e-velocity method is suitable for detecting cracks and voids in other directions. The pulse-echo method can be used from a s ingle f ace of the conduit, wher eas the puls e-velocity method r equires acces s to both faces of the conduit. Both methods are commonly used concurrently to get a complete evaluation of the conduit (Promboon, Olson, and Lund, 2002). Note that r ecent M ASW (s ection 10.1.1) and GP R (section 10.4) advances have allowed multiple different imaging methods to be us ed on a given s ite, allowing greater inter pretation conf idence in dif ficult pr oblem ar eas. 10.6.1 Ultrasonic thickness survey The thickness of an existing metal or steel pipe can be measured using an ultrasonic thicknes s survey. The survey is conducted by us ing a puls e-echo ultr asonic thicknes s gauge (f ultr asonic gauge deter mines the thicknes s of metal or steel pipe by accurately measuring the time required for a short ultrasonic pulse generated by a tr ansducer to tr avel thr ough the thicknes s of the pipe, r eflect f rom the back or inside surface, and be returned to the transducer. Different types of materials have different acoustic velocities. The advantages of performing an ultrasonic survey are: 256 Chapter 10\u2014Ev aluation by Geophysical and Nondestructiv e Testing Figure 146.\u2014Ultr asonic thickness gauge for measuring metal thickness. Thickness measurements can be taken without removing coating (with the exception of asphalt and concrete linings) on the interior of the pipe. Measurements can be taken on the exterior surfaces for exposed pipe while the pipe is in operation (i.e., full of water). Thickness measurements taken on the interior of the pipe help determine whether corrosion is occurring on the outside of the pipe shell for buried pipe or pipe encased in concrete. Measurements of paint thickness and oxidation/rust thickness can also be taken simultaneous ly dur ing the plate thicknes s survey. However, there are some limitations in performing a survey of this type. Factors that may pr event obtaining r eadings for specific sections of the metal or steel ar e: Water on the invert. Measurements cannot be taken for certain interior coatings, such as asphalt and cement- mortar lining. Rough, uneven, cor roded s urfaces can limit the bond between the tr ansducer and the s teel pipe, thus preventing thicknes s readings . Normally, the ultrasonic thickness survey is performed by man-entry into the pipe. However , for inacces sible pipes the thicknes s survey can be completed using a specially equipped pig that moves through the pipe. In some cases, if the exter ior surface of a pipe is acces sible, the s urvey can be completed without requiring man-entry into the pipe. This situation is applicable when the pipe is 257 Conduits through Embankment Dams located within a larger access conduit. This type of arrangement is discussed in section 3.1.1.1. The valleys of the pipe corrugations may be too tight to get a good bond between the transducer and the steel. Transducers vary in size, but 1/8 inch is about the smallest diameter transducer. In performing an ultrasonic thickness survey, measurements should be taken at interva ls sufficient to ga ther a n adequa te number of thickness mea surement da ta points to help ascertain the true wall thickness of the pipe. Measurements should be taken circumferentially about the pipe. Particular emphasis should be placed on taking meas urements near the inver t of the pipe, as this area is more susceptible to wall thinning (metal loss) due to abrasion and corrosion. Factors to consider in determining the amount of measured wall thinning are: Pipe manuf acturers tend to make the pipe wall s lightly lar ger than the thicknes s specified to ens ure they meet minimum wall thicknes s requirements . Testing accuracies depend upon the test instrument and the transducers. Most ultrasonic thicknes s equipment has an accur acy of at leas t 2 per cent. Accur acy is also dependent upon proper calibration of the instrument. If wall thinning is encountered, additional ultrasonic thickness surveys should be considered periodically (i.e., every 5 years, or more frequently, depending upon the severity of the wall thinning, cor rosion damage, etc.). A his tory of these wall thicknes s surveys may indicate the expected year ly decr ease in wall thicknes s, if uniform corrosion damage is occurring. A stress analys is of the pipe to deter mine structural adequacy is recommended, if the ultrasonic thicknes s survey indicates a wall los s greater than 10 per cent of its original specified value (s ee AST M A 796 and the USACE's Culverts, Conduits, and Pipes [1998a, pp. 4-4 and 4-5] for guidance on performing stress analysis for CMP). A detailed wall thicknes s survey allows an accur ate structural assessment of the pipe to be per formed. The results of the thicknes s surveys can be compar ed to the minimum acceptable plate thicknes s specified by des ign cr iteria to deter mine if the pipe has a sufficient s afety factor and if corrective action may be r equired. Inspection of welds can also be performed by ultrasonic techniques. This process requires the us e of an angle beam tr ansducer to detect f laws in the weld metal. Ultrasonic s ound waves are transmitted thr ough a tr ansducer, which r eflects them into the weld ar ea at an angle of 30 or 45 degr ees. The angled r eflection of the sound waves allows the flaw area to be detected and accurately sized. The interpretation of the results requires a great deal of experience, and should be performed by someone with a level 2 certification in ultrasonic testing. 258 Chapter 10\u2014Ev aluation by Geophysical and Nondestructiv e Testing 10.7 Mechanical and s onic caliper Calipers can provide information about the internal diameter of the conduit (USACE, 2001c, p. 32). Caliper s are used for detecting any changes or defects that cause changes in interior dimensions, such as pits, holes, cracks, deformations, damage, or corrosion. Caliper meas urements are made us ing mechanical, s onic, or ultrasonic methods. For the mechanical method, metal \"feeler\" instruments contact the ins ide wall of the conduit. The pos itions of the f eelers are sensed electr onically and r ecorded on a pr intout. The sonic or ultra sonic caliper s use transducers that beam a puls e to the conduit wall. The puls e is reflected by the wall back to the transducer and inter preted bas ed on its time of transit. Typically, caliper s are used in conduits with diameter s 18 inches or larger. Caliper s are deployed us ing a wir e cable or smart pig. Some caliper tools can be used underwater. 10.8 Radiography The radiography method encompasses any type of penetrating radiation, such as X-rays, gamma rays, beta particles, neutron beams, or proton beams. Radiography is useful for detecting cr acks, voids , and def ects, or for viewing the inter nal compos ition of a conduit. Differences in thicknes s and dens ity ar e easily meas ured and can be seen on a screen or recorded onto film. Although radiography is gener ally quick, ef ficient, and accur ate, the complex natur e of the equipment, cos ts involved, training, and certification requirements often limit its use. 10.9 Surface hardnes s The rebound hammer and penetration resistance methods are quick, simple to use, and inexpensive to perform. These methods can be performed by field personnel with a limited amount of training and instruction. These methods are useful in assessing the general quality of concrete and locating areas of poor quality concrete in a conduit. However, these methods do have a number of limitations, including imprecise measurements of the in-situ strength of concrete. The rebound hammer and penetration resistance methods require man-entry access into the conduit. 10.10 Conduit evaluation by des tructive tes ting Although not utilized often in conduits , destructive tes ting can be us ed to gather more data. Concrete cores can be cut from selected locations to obtain representative samples. Samples are often taken from deteriorated areas and from good quality concrete for comparative purposes. A petrographer can examine the 259 Conduits through Embankment Dams concrete cores, or strength tests can be performed on the cores. By using microscopic analys is and var ious chemical tes ts, a petr ographer can deter mine the air content of hardened concr ete, es timate the cement content, f ind evidence of carbonation or other reactions, and detect admixtures or contaminating substances that may have been present during construction. A petrographer can also make general observations about water-cement ratio, degree of cement hydration, early frost damage, excessive bleeding, and similar phenomena. Strength testing on the cores may include tens ile and compres sive. Drilling of concrete cores in conduits is expensive and should only be used when sampling and testing of the concrete is neces sary. 260 Chapter 11 Appropriate Emergency Actions Embankment dams are owned and operated by individuals, private and public organizations, and the government. An embankment dam failure resulting in an uncontrolled release of the reservoir can have a devastating effect on persons and property downstream. Even though an embankment dam may be well maintained, the potential for development of conditions that could lead to failure of the embankment dam always exists. Chapter 11 provides guidance on the appropriate actions needed during an emergency situation involving a conduit through an embankment dam. Often emergency situations involving the conduit lead to related problems with the embankment dam. Therefore, this chapter considers not only emergency actions for conduits, but also actions required for the embankment dam. 11.1 Implementation of an Emergency Act ion Plan Many types of emer gency events could jeopar dize the s afety and s tructural integr ity of an embankment dam and threaten the safety of the general public downstream of the dam. Whenever people live in areas that could be inundated as a result of a failure of or misoperation at a embankment dam, the potential exists for loss of life and significant damage to downstream property. Developing thorough and consistent Emergency Action Plans (EAPs) in an effort to help save lives and reduce property damage in areas that would be affected by the failure or misoperation of a specific embankment dam and maintaining up-to-date points of contact and phone numbers are important. Copies of the EAP should be provided to emergency management agencies and personnel and periodically discussed with them. If no EAP exists, contact the State dam s afety office. Emergencies involving conduit related issues are only one aspect of potential embankment dam failures. An EAP is a formal document that: Identifies potential failure conditions at an embankment dam and specifies prepla nned a ctions to be followed to a ttempt to prevent a dam failure a nd to possibly minimize downstream property damage and potential loss of life. 261 Conduits through Embankment Dams Specifies actions the embankment dam owner and others should take to mitigate or alleviate a potential dam f ailure during an emer gency. Contains procedures and information to assist the embankment dam owner in issuing early warning and notification messages to responsible downstream emer gency management author ities of the emer gency. Includes notification of the State dam safety officials and designates a qualified professional engineer who is experienced in embankment dam design and construction and should also be notified to assist in the emergency response. Contains inundation maps to show the emergency management authorities the critical ar eas for evacuation in cas e of an emer gency. An EAP is needed for two main reasons: To plan the coordination of necessary actions by the embankment dam owner and the responsible local, State and/or federal officials to provide for timely notification, warning and evacuation in the event of an embankment dam failure or releas e (controlled or uncontrolled). To reduce the risk of loss of life and property damage, particularly in the downs tream ar eas, resulting f rom an emer gency. An ef fective EAP is gener ally compr ised of six bas ic elements as follows (FEMA, 2004, pp. 4-5): 1. Notification flowchart .\u2014A notification flowchart shows who is to be notified, by whom, and in what priority. The information on the notification flowchart is necessary for the timely notification of persons responsible for taking emergency actions. The flowchart should contain a primary and alternate telephone number (including cell phone numbers) for each person to be contacted. Instructions should state that if the person being contacted does not answer the telephone, a message should be left. But the next person on the list must be called and given the inf ormation. The caller must continue the aler t proces s in each alert level until a pers on has phys ically been talked to in that level. This person then continues the alert proces s for the level in the s ame manner. 2. Detection, decisionmaking/classification and notification .\u2014Ear ly detection and evaluation of the situa tion(s) or triggering event(s) tha t initia te or require a n emer gency action ar e critical. The establis hment of procedur es for the r eliable an emer gency s ituation is imper ative to ens ure that the appropriate course of action is taken based on the urgency of the situation. 262Chapter 11\u2014Ap propriate emergency-action-related tas ks should be assigned during the development of the plan. Embankment dam owners are responsible for developing, maintaining and implementing the EAP. State and local emergency management officials having statutory obligation are responsible for the warning and evacuation of the general public within the affected ar eas. The EAP should clear ly specify the embankment dam owner 's respons ibilities , to ens ure effective, timely action is taken s hould an emergency occur at the dam. The EAP must be site specific, becaus e all embankment dams are different. 4. Preparedness.\u2014Preparednes s actions are taken to mitigate or alleviate the ef fects of an embankment dam failure or operational res ervoir releas e and to facilitate the appropriate response to emergencies. This section of the EAP identifies actions to be taken before and/or during any emergency. 5. Inundatio n maps .\u2014Inundation maps should delineate the areas that would be flooded as a result of a embankment dam failure for normal and flood conditions or uncontrolled release. Inundation maps are used by both the embankment dam owner and emergency management officials to facilitate timely notification and evacuation of areas affected by an embankment dam failure or flooding. These maps greatly facilitate notification, by graphically displaying flooded areas and showing travel times for wave fronts and flood peaks at critical locations. These maps should be used in advance to develop warning and evacuation plans, but should only be used for guidance. 6. Appendices.\u2014The appendices contain information that supports and supplements the mater ial used in the development and maintenance of the EAP . Once the EAP has been developed, approved and distributed to the proper authorities , the plan s till needs to be properly maintained and exercis ed. Without periodic maintenance, the EAP will become outdated, los e its effectivenes s, and no longer be us eable. If the plan is not exer cised (validated), thos e involved in its implementation may not be aware of their roles and res pons ibilities , particularly if emergency response personnel change over time. If the plan is not updated periodically, the information contained in it may become outdated, incorrect, and useless. An EAP should be developed for site-specific conditions and to the requirements of the agency/organization that owns or regulates the use of the specific embankment dam. The intent of this document is not to provide every detail necessary to develop an effective and useful EAP. The requirements of an EAP vary from State/federal agencies as to the format, level of detail, and information presented in the EAP. For further guidance on developing an ef fective EAP , see the r eferences from the 263Conduits through Embankment Dams Canadian Dam Safety As sociation (1997); FEMA (1987, 1998, 2004); Colorado Divis ion of Water Res ources (1997); FERC (1998); Reclamation (1989a, 1995); and USACE (1996). Once the EAP has been developed and approved, the appropriate implementation of the EAP is essential and critical to the s afety of the general public living downs tream of the dam. The EAP should lis t the pr oper procedur es for the timely and reliable detection, evaluation, and classification of an existing, developing, or potential emer gency. The conditions , events or meas ures for detection of an exis ting or potential emergency should be listed. Data and information collection systems should be dis cussed, such as inspection pr ocedur es, rule cur ves, and ins trumentation plans . The proces s that will be us ed to analyze incoming data s hould als o be discussed. Additionally, procedures, aids, instructions and provisions for evaluation of the collected inf ormation and data to as sess the s everity and magnitude of any existing or potential emergency situation should be discussed. Emer gencies are clas sified accor gency. An emer gency classification s ystem is one means of classifying emer gency events accor ding to the different times at which they occur and to their varying levels of severity. The classification s ystem should indicate the ur gency of the emer gency condition or response. Emergency classifications should use terms agreed to by the embankment dam owner and emergency management officials during the planning process, in order for the system to work and to ensure that organizations understand terminology and respond appropriately to the event. The organizations that will us e titles for emergency clas sifications should choos e them carefully, s o that everyone will unders tand what each clas sification level means eceived. Declar ation of an emer gency can be a very controversial decision. The issue should not be debated too long. An early decision and declaration are critical to maximize available response time. Depending on the type of embankment dam, possible emergency events and the potential hazard zone downstream of the particular dam, two or more emergency classifications may be required to ensure the proper and effective response to emergencies at the dam. Coordination is required with State dam safety offices. Three embankment dam f ailure emer gency clas sifications are suggested: Embankment dam failure is imminent or has occurred. A potential embankment dam failure situation is developing. Nonemergency or unusual condition. 264 Chapter 11\u2014Ap that a f ailure is imminent or has occur red should convey the impres sion that the embankment dam is failing, and appropriate evacuation procedures should be employed. This is a situation where a failure has occur red, is occur ring, or obvious ly is just about to occur . Therefore, once an embankment dam owner determines that there is no longer any time available to attempt cor rective meas ures to pr event f ailure, the \"f ailure is imminent or has occur red\" war ning should be is sued. Emer gency management agencies , for evacuation purposes, should conservatively interpret the phrase \"failure is imminent\" to mean that the embankment dam is failing, and all appropriate parties should be notified to commence emer that a potential embankment dam f ailure situation is developing s hould convey the impres sion that s ome time s till remains for further analyses/decisions and remedial actions to be made before an embankment dam failure is considered to be imminent. This is a situation where the condition of the embankment dam is deter iorating r apidly and f ailure may eventually occur ; however , preplanned actions taken during certain events could mitigate or alleviate failure of the embankment dam. Even if failure is inevitable, more time is generally available than the \"failure is imminent\" condition to issue warnings and/or take preparedness actions. All appropriate parties should be on standby-alert status and should be notified to commence their emer gency oper ations and evacuation, if required. The \"nonemergency or unusual condition\" classification applies where an unusual problem or condition has occurred, but a failure of the embankment dam is not considered imminent. This is a situation or circumstance that may af fect the integrity of the embankment dam but is considered controllable. This condition could lead to a failure of the embankment dam, if appropriate actions or repairs are not employed. All appropriate parties should be notified periodically with regard to the status of the condition of the dam and should be on standby-alert status for emergency actions, should conditions deteriorate. Table 11.1 pr ovides a guide f or deter mining the level of urgency and the emer gency classification as sociated with emer gency conditions attributed to the inter nal erosion or backward eros ion piping of earthfill materials (Colorado Divis ion of Water Resources , 1997, p. 11; FEMA, 1998). Prompt and effective response to an emergency at a particular damsite could result in the mitigation or avoidance of a embankment dam failure incident, or help reduce the effects of a dam failure or operational s pillway releas e, and facilitate res pons e to the emer gency. The preventive actions that an embankment dam owner may take include providing emergency flooding operating instructions, and arranging for equipment, labor, and the s tockpiling of materials for us e in an emergency s ituation. An effective EAP should describe preventive actions to be taken during t he development of emergency conditions. 265 Table 11.1.\u2014Assessing emer gency classification and urgency Level of u rgency and response Non emergenc y Potential dam failu re Embankment d am fai lure is condition.\u2014New o r developin g.\u2014Possible emb ankment d am imminent.\u2014Embankment d am failure increased pro blem.

Facilitating the operation of the embankment dam in an emergency through dam operator training. Minimizing the extent of damage resulting from emergencies that do develop. Timely implementation of the EAP and coordination and communication with downs tream local author ities are crucial elements in the ef fectivenes s of emer gency respons e. The hould contain a dis cussion of provis ions for s urveillance and evaluation of an emergency and should clearly indicate that emergency response procedures can be implemented in a timely manner. An important factor in the effectiveness of an EAP is the prompt detection and evaluation of information obtained from instrumentation and/or physical inspection procedures. Certain planning and organizational measures can help the embankment dam owner and local emergency response personnel manage the emergency more safely and effectively. These meas ures include s tockpiling materials and equipment for emer gency us e, and coor dinating inf ormation. Alter native s ources of power for spillway or outlet works gate/valve operation and other emergency us es should als o be pr ovided. The EAP should lis t the location of each power source, its mode of operation and, if it is a portable source, the means of transportation and routes to be followed to the dams ite. The EAP s hould document the following items as they pertain to s tockpiling materials, obtaining equipment, and contacting personnel for use in the event of an emer gency. Not all embankment dams lend thems elves to a need to have s tockpiled materials and equipment. The materials and equipment can be stockpiled at the dams ite or an acces sible site within clos e proximity to the dams ite. Resources needed may include: Materials needed f or emer gency r epair and their location, s ource, and intended use. Materials should be as close to the dams ite as possible. Equipment to be us ed, its location, and who will operate the equipment. How the equipment operator or construction contractor is to be contacted. 267 Conduits through Embankment Dams Any other personnel who may be needed, like laborers and the design engineer, and how they are to be contacted. If there is no designer of record, a list of two to three qualified professional engineers should be available for contact. The EAP should also document the following items as they pertain to coordination of information and communicating with the emergency response personnel: The need for coordination of information on flows based on weather conditions and runoff forecasts and embankment dam failure and other emergency conditions. Describe how the coordination is achieved and the chain of communications, including names and telephone numbers of responsible people. Additional actions contemplated to respond to an emergency situation or embankment dam failure at an unattended dam. Actions to be taken to lower the reservoir. Describe when and how (maximum drawdown ra te) this a ction should be ta ken. Also, a lterna tive mea ns of evacuating the r eservoir should be s pecified in the event the outlet wor ks is inoperable, releases through the outlet conduit are not recommended due to a internal erosion situation, or the outlet capacity has been reduced for some reason. Actions to be taken to reduce inflow into the reservoir from upstream dams or control structures. The inflows should be stopped or diverted around the reservoir, if possible . Actions to be taken to reduce downstream flows, such as increasing or decreasing outf lows from downs tream dams or contr ol structures on the waterway on which the embankment dam is located or its tributaries. The EAP should also describe other site-specific or emergency repair actions that can be devis ed to moder ate or alleviate the extent of the potential emer gency and possible failure of the embankment dam. The EAP will recommend actions , but serves only as a guide, s ince ther e are typically many var iables . A tr ained dam s afety official will, in mos t cases, need to determine the type of action required. Table 11.2 provides a list of potential problems and immediate response or emergency repair actions that can be undertaken. This is a relatively comprehensive list and includes problems and the associated emergency response as they relate to conduits through embankment dams (FEMA, 1987; Colorado Division of Resources , 2002). Caution is advis ed in us ing table 11.2, s ince many variables are involved, and each damsite is different. 268Table 11.2 .\u2014Potential problems and immediate response or emergency repair actions Problem or conditions Cause Response or emer gency repair actions Internal erosion Water has created an open Begin monitoring the o utflow quantity and and back ward pathway, channel or pipe establishing whether water is getti ng mud dier, staying the erosion pipin g through the emb ankment d am. same, o r clearing up . through the The seepage water is eroding If the quantity of flow is in creasing, the reservoir embankment and carryin g embankment should be lowe red until the flow st abilizes or st ops. dam, fo undation materials.

The respons ibility for maintaining a safe embankment dam rests with the owner. For many owners, the proper operation and maintenance of the embankment dam is only one aspect of their organization's activities . Safely maintaining the embankment dam is a key element in preventing a failure and limiting the liability that an owner could face. An important way to help reduce an owner's exposure to the potential for an embankment dam failure is to have a qualified dam engineer periodically ins pect and as sess the dam for the development of problems that could lead to the dam's failure. The engineer should provide a written inspection report with recommendations for repairs for any potential problems found. 11.2.1 The need for an engineer Embankment dams , like any other natural or cons tructed s tructures , will deteriorate with time. Failure of a embankment dam, whether due to conduit deterioration, inadequate s pillway capacity, s eismic inadequacies , or other reas ons could leave the dam owner liable for lives lost and property damage that occur downstream as a result of the failure. For these reasons, the owner needs to be sure that the embankment dam and any appur tenant water -retaining s tructures have been designed, cons tructed, and maintained to withs tand each of the pr obable loadings that thes e structures could be s ubject to dur ing their lifetime. To maintain a s afe embankment dam and minimize the pos sibility of a dam failure, regular periodic inspections , proper maintenance, and occas ional repair and rehabilitation of the structures are inevitable. To perform thes e tasks, an owner needs the exper tise of a qualif ied pr ofessional engineer (ADSO, undated), exper ienced in the des ign and construction of embankment dams and appurtenant structures. If no design and construction dr awings and r ecords exist for the engineer to wor k with, it may be neces sary for the engineer to develop bas ic plans and calculations . These will help the owner and engineer better unders tand the s tructures , evaluate them for s tability conditions, and understand the consequences of a embankment dam failure. An engineer can als o provide the owner with as sistance in s electing a contr actor to perform repair or remediation work if necessary and can provide construction quality contr ol if needed. 11.2.2 The type of engineer needed Choosing a registered professional engineer (P.E.) with a civil and geotechnical engineer ing backgr ound, who is competent and exper ienced in the f ield of dam safety is impor tant. Criteria to look f or in the pr ospective dam engineer include: 271 Conduits through Embankment Dams A licens ed professional engineer , P.E., with a civil engineer ing degr ee A minimum of 10 years of experience with embankment dam design, construction, and inspections A knowledge of the rules and regulations governing embankment dam design and cons truction in the State wher e the dam is located Specif ic exper ience in the pr hydr aulics , structural, or geotechnical engineer ing 11.2.3 Finding a qualified dam engineer A good way to locate a qualif ied pr ofessional engineer is to contact your State dam safety office for recommendations . If the State dam s afety office is not lis ted in your local telephone directory, you may find this information on the Internet under the (name of State) dam safety office or on the (name of State) government home page. Another source for obtaining the telephone number of your State dam safety office and/or the names of exper ienced dam engineer s within your State is the As sociation of State Dam Safety Officials (ASDSO) at 859-257-5140 in Lexington, Kentucky. 11.2.4 Choos ing an engineer who is best for your needs Cons ultants are typically s elected f or engineer ing cons ulting s ervices using one of three bas ic processes: Qualification-based .\u2014Qualification-based selection means that the knowledge, exper ience, and ingenuity of the engineer are the cr itical f actors in making the selection. This strategy is used when the owner is uncer tain about the exact problem or the best solution to the problem. Typically, several engineering firms submit their technical qualif ications , exper ience with s imilar projects , reputation with existing clients, and any other factors pertaining to the specific project. The owner selects the thr ee mos t qualif ied firms to make br ief presentations outlining cost-effective and innovative approaches to solve the problem. Based upon these presentations, the owner chooses the most qualif ied engineer to develop a s cope of work. When agr eement on the s cope of work is achieved, the engineer and the owner negotiate a pr ice that is fair and reasonable to both parties. Fee-based.\u2014Fee-based selection means that the determining factor in choosing the engineer is the engineer 's fee. This appr oach can be us ed if the owner knows exactly what wor k is needed and can clear ly def ine the s cope of work. This process has the disadvantage that the engineer best qualified to perform the wor k may not get the job. 272Chapter 11\u2014Ap propriate E mergency Acti ons Intermediate .\u2014The inter mediate option is a cross between the qualif ication- based selection and f ee-based selection pr ocesses. In the inter mediate pr ocess, the owner prequalifies engineers based on their experience and qualifications, who are then asked to submit a fee-based proposal for a defined scope of work. This proces s ensures a higher level of certainty that the work will be of s uperior quality, but r equires the owner to clear ly def ine the s cope of the wor k to be done. 11.3 Sinkholes and s ubsidence Sinkholes or subsidence of the embankment s urface in the immediate ar ea of the conduit are usually the result of erosion of the embankment material. They usually indicate a very serious problem that needs immediate attention. Figure 147 shows an example of a s inkhole that occurred over an s pillway conduit. Seepage f rom the ar ea around the conduit at the downs tream end is also a serious problem, es pecially if it is a new occur rence. Seepage that is carrying embankment mater ial, viewed as muddy water , is of immediate concer n. Seepage of this type in conjunction with active s ubsidence or sinkholes is caus e for immediate alar m and emergency action. Sinkholes can also develop around or adjacent to air shafts constructed to supply a ir to slide ga tes within a n outlet works conduit. The following s ection will dis cuss sinkholes and s ubsidence as sociated with conduits through embankment dams. These types of phenomena may occur on embankment dams for other reasons, but that is outside the scope of this document. For an example of a sinkhole that developed over a conduit, see the Sardis Dam case history in appendix B. 11.3.1 Initial response The first response to the observance of new sinkholes or areas of subsidence is to initiate appropriate emergency actions . Unles s it is determined conclus ively that the conditions on the embankment dam are stable and not deteriorating, then it should be as sumed that an emer gency exis ts. The emer gency action plan s hould be implemented. The reservoir should be drawn down as soon as possible, but not neces sarily thr ough the exis ting conduit. Section 11.4 dis cusses alter native means of reservoir evacuation. New s eepage or cloudy s eepage as discussed in chapter 9 is also of concern. 273Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 147.\u2014Sinkhole ov er a spillway condui t. 11.3.2 Initial remediation If the sinkholes are active and it appear s that immediat e remediat ion is needed t o stabilize the s ituation, the placement of a well graded s and and gravel mix with nonplastic fines into the sinkhole can be attempted. The concept is that placement of thes e materials directly into the hole will caus e the s and and gravel to be trans ported directly to the defect in the conduit. A well graded mix will hopefully contain s ome particles that are larger than the defect and thes e will thus get trapped. Once this occurs , then other, s maller particles will be trapped. Eventually the process is capable of filtering the embankment dam's core mater ial, caus ing a s eal to form, arresting the erosion completely. This type of solution should only be considered a temporary one, to be followed by a full investigation of the problem. 11.3.3 Investigation A full investigation should be conducted to determine the root cause of the sinkhole or subsidence ar ea. This is absolutely neces sary. No per manent s olution can be designed until the problem is pinpointed. Should a sinkhole become visible on the surface of an embankment dam, it is likely that an eros ional failure mode is well underway. Emergency meas ures should be instituted as described in this chapter . After the emer gency conditions have been stabilized, probably by lowering the res ervoir level, a forens ic inves tigation of the sinkhole is warranted. A carefully planned and executed investigation can provide 274 Chapter 11\u2014Ap propriate E mergency Acti ons important information that will help determine what type of repair is mos t appropriate. The surface expression of a sinkhole is most often a small indicator of a much larger cavity beneath the surface. Any investigation of a sinkhole should assume that the subsurface conditions are much worse than they appear to be. Case histories have demonstrated that sinkholes at depth can be much larger than what appears on the surface. Most often, a sinkhole that was caused by erosion of embankment material into a conduit will be located immediately above the alignment of the conduit, and the following dis cussions apply to this situation. Figure 148 illus trates a typical s equence of the formation of a sinkhole located above a conduit. Figure 149 shows an example of a sinkhole wher e the continued r emoval of soil would have caus ed the roof of the caver n to migr ate to the s urface of the embankment dam. Sinkholes that are not associated with a conduit may have different considerations and are not furthe r disc ussed here. Investigations of sinkholes above conduits should be pr eceded by a r eview of the conduit and embankment design to ensure that the investigation does not increase the amount of damage. Most often, the sinkhole is investigated initially by a backhoe excavation conducted from the s urface. This is performed to initially determine the magnitude of the pr oblem and to s ee if the caus e can be r eadily es tablis hed. Also, the interior of the conduit below the sinkhole area should be inspected to determine if there are holes or other damaged ar eas that could be the point wher e embankment material has entered the conduit. Sometimes a depression in the surface of the embankment dam will give an early indication of a A defect in the conduit allows soil to fall into the condu it. Water flowing in the conduit w ill continually remove the soil. Seepage thr ough the embankment dam can accelerate process in a non-pressurized conduit. Defect Conduit Defect Defect Conduit Surface of the embankment dam Surface of the embankment dam Surface of the embankment dam Initial formation of a cavern in the embankment dam Debris from the roof will fall to floor of the cavern and then into the conduit and be removed by flowing water can be very steep Cavern Debris may hide the defect in the conduit sinkhole forming below Side slopes of the cavern Flow Flow Conduit Flow The debris removal process continues (called stoping) until it reaches the surface of the embankment dam. Eventually, the roof will collapse. Figure 148.\u2014Typi cal sequence of the for mation of a sinkhole. 275 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 149.\u2014Inci pient si nkhole i n an embankment dam. Eventua lly, the conti nued r emoval of the soi l at the bottom of the ca vern would ha ve caused the r oof to migrate to the surfa ce of the em bankment da m. If the backhoe inves tigation res ults in limited information, it may be neces sary to perform a major excavation of the embankment dam to ascertain that the entire sinkhole has been f ound. This inves tigation may be combined with the actual r epair, as long as the excavation plans are sufficiently f lexible to allow f or complete r emoval of the s inkhole wher ever it is found. In-situ testing has been successful at some sites to l ook for soft a reas or v oids. A cone penetr ometer testing pr ogram has been us ed. A clos ely spaced s eries of tests performed on a grid pattern can help discern the limits of any soft areas. At other sites, ground pe netrating radar has been some what successful to he lp locate some incipient sinkholes that were near the embankment dam crest, but had not yet broken thr ough to the s urface. 11.3.4 Repair If complete r eplacement of the conduit is chos en as the r epair method, then it is much eas ier to repair the embankment dam. If the conduit is repaired by s ome in- situ method, then the repair of the sinkhole is made more difficult. In both cases, the basic concept is to repair the embankment dam with a material that is as good or better tha n the origina l material. The ma terial to be used should be selected to perform the same function as the surrounding material. If the repair area is within the impervious core portion of the embankment dam, then similar material should be us ed. Similarly, s hell material s hould als o be us ed in areas outs ide of the core. If 276 Chapter 11\u2014Ap propriate E mergency Acti ons existing f ilters and dr ains were impacted, then thes e too s hould be r eplaced. New filters and drains should be added as needed. Several factors determine the extent of the excavation required to repair a sinkhole that was caus ed from embankment s oil being er oded into a conduit def ect. One factor is the method us ed to r epair the def ect in the conduit. In some cas es, the conduit will be not be replaced, but will be repaired by one of the s liplining methods . In that case, the embankment does not have to be excavated to gain access to the conduit from the outside for repair operations. The extent and configuration of the required excavation will then depend on how much embankment was damaged by the sinkhole, and how the excavation must be prepared before subsequent replacement of the s inkhole and excavated embankment can pr oceed. The configuration for the excavation made to repair the sinkhole must consider differential s ettlement that will occur between the excavation backf ill and adjacent embankment and foundation soils that have already consolidated. The shape of the excavation mus t also allow ef ficient oper ation of compaction equipment us ed in the reconstruction. Section 5.2 discusses the dangers of arching that can occur in backfilled trenches that are overly s teep, particularly when the trench is trans verse to the embankment center line. Recommendations in that s ection s uggest that any excavation made to repair sinkholes should probably be no steeper than 2H:1V for this reason, and only that steep, if the embankment soils have favorable properties. Flatter slopes are recommended f or less favorable conditions . The excavation mus t also be configured for use of appropriate compaction equipment. The slopes of the excavation mus t be flat enough to operate equipment s afely as the backfill of the sinkhole pr oceeds . If the r epair of the s inkhole involves excavation and r eplacement of the damaged conduit, consider the recommendations for conduit replacement provided in chapter 13 together with the r ecommendations above. In mos t cases, the excavation required to replace the conduit will als o remove the portion of the embankment dam that was damaged by the sinkhole. 11.4 Alternativ e means of res ervoir ev acuation Alter native means of evacuating the r eservoir should be s pecified in the event that the outlet works is inoperable, releases through the conduit are not possible/ recommended due to internal erosion or backward erosion piping, or the outlet capacity has been r educed f or some reason. The selection of a means that is appropriate depends on the size of the reservoir, the physical features of the particular dams ite, the availability of equipment and materials , the volume of water that could be released, and the required rate of release. Care should be employed in deter mining the means of reservoir evacuation dur ing a s pecific emer gency, to 277 Conduits through Embankment Dams ensure that the reservoir releases do not cause loss of life or significant property damage downstream. 11.4.1 Siphoning A siphon is a closed conduit system formed in the shape of an inverted U. A siphon (figure 150) can be used to partially drain a small reservoir. A single or a series of siphons can be constructed. Typically, siphons are placed up and over the embankment dam and extended to the toe of the dam. The downstream portion of the siphon can be charged with water and then released to create the siphonic action to start the siphoning of water. The downstream end of the siphon should be equipped with a gate or valve to facilitate creating the s iphonic action. Multiple methods should be considered for priming siphons, such as a vacuum pump, water pump, or hand pump. Provisions for breaking the siphon (siphon breaker vent) should be provided at the crest of the embankment dam, should the need arise. At the discharge end of the siphon, the area should be properly protected to ensure that the discharging water does not cause erosional damage. A siphon over an embankment dam is illustrated in figure 151. The siphon in figure 151 is shown extending over the dam cr est to avoid excavation into the embankment dam. If the siphon must be excavated through the embankment dam crest, the guidance provided in chapter 5 s hould be utilized. Siphons are typically constructed of either PVC, HDPE, steel pipe and typically do not exceed 12 inches in diameter ; however , in some ins tances , siphons as large as 15 to 18 inches in diameter have been s uccessfully utilized for s mall embankment dams. Because of the negative pressures prevalent in the siphon, the pipe should be sufficiently r igid to withs tand the collaps ing forces. Pipe joints must be water tight, and the designer must take measures to avoid cracking of the pipe caused by movement or settlement of the embankment dam. In order to prevent absolute pressure s within the pipe from a pproa ching cavitation or c ollapsing presssure s, the total drop of the siphon should be limited to a maximum of 20 feet. During emer gencies , some cavitation damage may be an acceptable tr adeof f. Embankment dam owners and surrounding property owners should be aware that the use of siphons results in more frequent fluctuation in reservoir level when compared to more traditional pipe-and-ris er spillway s ystems. This is a res ult of the inherent inefficiency of the siphon prior to priming of the system. Siphons prime with a head between 1 and 1\u00bc times the diameter of the s iphon above the s iphon invert. For example, the water s urface in the res ervoir will need to ris e about 12 to 14 inches before a 12-inch diameter siphon becomes most efficient. Once the siphon primes, outflow increases very little with increases in head (reservoir level) (Monroe, Wilson, and Bendel 2002, p. 20). If a series of siphons is used at a site, they must be properly spaced to avoid close proximity. To close of proximity to 278 Chapter 11\u2014Ap propriate E mergency Acti ons Figure 150.\u2014Siph on used to lower t he reservo ir wat er surface through the upper entrance of a n outlet w orks intake structure. Figure 151.\u2014A simple siphon constr ucted ov er the cr est of a n embankment da m. each other may cause problems at the intakes of the siphons. Air may be sucked into the siphon pipe, causing the vacuum to be lost. The advantages of a siphon include: The installation of a siphon can be performed in a relatively short amount of time. A siphon can be constructed with automatic operation to eliminate the need for frequent manual manipulation. The reservoir does not have to be completely drained. Maintaining a partial pool allows for the maintenance of some of the aquatic habitat. A siphon allows for the removal of cool water from relatively deep areas within the reservoir to pr omote cold water fish habitat downs tream. In areas wher e trout populations are threatened by high water temperatures, a siphon can be used to combat the r ise in stream temper ature. 279 Conduits through Embankment Dams Specialty contr actors are not r equired, if quality engineer ing over sight is available during construction. The disadvantages of a siphon include: Inability to handle flows greater than the des igned capacity even though des ign head exceeds the des ign level. Inefficient f low at heads below 1 to 1\u00bc times the diameter of the pipe, caus ing more frequent f luctuation in the water surface when compar ed to pipe- and-riser spillways . Not cos t effective (or , in many cas es, feasible) f or large water sheds. Gener ally limited to s mall drainage bas ins with relatively s mall peak inflows . A siphon designed for automatic operation may require excavation into the embankment dam to locate it below the anticipated reservoir water level. If the s iphon extends above the res ervoir water level, it will require s ome means of initiating the siphonic action. Can be s usceptible to vandalis m unles s protective meas ures are taken. Inability to drain the entire res ervoir and limited ability to drain res ervoir deeper than about 20 to 25 feet. Some underwater work may be required for construction of the siphon. A siphon is not recommended in colder climates. Siphons are susceptible to blockage with ice unless special provisions are implemented during design and construction. Siphon piping may require removal from the reservoir during winter to avoid damage f rom ice loadings . Other wise, the ice s urrounding the siphon may have to be broken up daily. The theoretical lift on the upstream side of the siphon is less for sites at higher elevations compar ed to thos e at s ea level. Best suited for low head operations to avoid cavitation potential. Storms or snow may prevent site access for personnel to operate the siphon. For examples of siphons constructed at embankment dams, see the Crossgate and Sugar Mill Dams case histories in appendix 280Chapter 11\u2014Ap propriate E mergency Pumping Pumping of the reservoir w ater can be used to dra in relatively small reservoirs. A single or a series of high capacity (e.g., 3,000-gal/min) portable pumps can be delivered to the damsite to assist in draining of the reservoir. The pumps can be positioned in the s pillway entrance or on the embankment dam cres t (figure 152) and allowed to dis charge into the s pillway or outlet works , or the pump can be placed over and down the downs tream face of the embankment dam to the downs tream toe. At the dis charge end of the pumps , the ar ea should be pr operly protected to ensure that the dis charging does not caus e erosional damage. Pumps are us ually s elf-contained and trailer or s kid mounted. They can us ually be rented in nearby major metropolitan communities, or they can be delivered and set up by the supplier. State or local flood control agencies may be another readily available s ource for high capacity pumps . Pumps are typically gas oline, dies el, or electr ically power ed. If electr ically power ed, a r eliable electr ical source should be available at the damsite. Purchasing pumps requires continuing maintenance on the pump and has a greater one-time expense compared to renting. Purchase may be justified for remote locations or to fulfill other needs for a high capacity pump by the dam owner , especially if one pump can s ervice multiple dams . See the B alman Reservoir Dam case history in appendix B for an example of using a pump to evacuate a reservoir. Another consideration with pumps is the limited net positive suction head available, (NPSHA) which es sentially is the atmos pheric pres sure les s any s uction line friction losses and the height of the lift. To avoid cavitation, all pumps are rated with a net positive s uction head r equired (NP SHR). If the NP SHA does not exceed the NPSHR, the pump will not operate. Also, as the NPSHA approaches the NPSHR, the pump capacity decr eases. Placing the pump as close to the r eservoir water surface as possible and us ing lar ge diameter suction lines to minimize f riction los s maximizes pump capacity. For reservoirs deeper than about 15 to 20 f eet, pumps located on the dam cres t or s pillway cres t may not be able to totally drain the reservoir becaus e the height of the lif t from the water surface to the pump by its elf exceeds the NP SHA when r eservoir levels are down, unles s the pump can be moved along with the r eceding r eservoir water surface. Becaus e of the potential f or complications caused by terrain and reservoir sediments, the frequent movement of trailer-mounted pumps may not be practical. However, floating pumps are available for these situations but are usually more expensive and probably not as available for rent as trailer-mounted units . Totally draining the reservoir is usua lly not ne cessary to suc cessfully evacuate the reservoir to levels that mitigate embankment dam failure. Usually, only a portion of the total reservoir requires evacuation to stop or control the erosion processes occur ring within the embankment dam. 281 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 152.\u2014All available resources m ay need to be uti lized to dra in the reservo ir in an emergen cy. Here, t he local fire depart ment assist s in draining a lake dur ing a thunder storm after the 45-yea r old CMP spi llway collapsed. 11.4.3 Removal of the inlet structure (tower or riser pipe) of a drop inlet spillway conduit If the exis ting s pillway conduit can s afely accommodate flowing water (e.g., it is in good condition), it may be possible to provide a limited amount of reservoir drawdown by carefully removing a section of the upper portion of the inlet structure and allowing the res ervoir to drain out through the exis ting s pillway. This method is best suited for low hazard embankment dams with small diameter riser pipes. To accomplis h this method, the r iser is removed in s tages. For example, a CM P riser pipe can be removed in sections using an abrasive \"cutoff saw\" or hydraulic shears to cut ver tical s lots in the upper few inches of the r iser followed by bending the metal wall downward. The reservoir s hould be allowed to drop to a s afe level prior to removing additional sections of the riser. If the riser can be temporarily isolated from the reservoir with a portable cofferdam, a torch can be used to remove the upper portion of the riser. This procedure was used to lower the pool of an embankment dam in Maryland by about 1.5 feet (figure 153). Care must be taken when r emoving the inlet s tructure to ens ure that the materials being removed do not fall into and plug the s pillway conduit, and debris does not enter the conduit (f igure 154). 282 Chapter 11\u2014Ap propriate E mergency Acti ons Figure 153.\u2014The upper po rtion of a smal l metal pipe riser st ructure was removed wi th an acetylene torch. The ri ser wa s isolated from the pool by surro unding it with a large drum pressed i nto the so il. A pum p was used to remove the w ater betw een the dr um and the r iser so tha t the w ork was completed i n the dr y. Figure 154.\u2014Care must be ta ken to ensure tha t debri s does not clog spillway after remo val of the riser. 283 Conduits through Embankment Dams 11.4.4 Removal of the control structur e of the spillway ( concr ete spillway) The concrete control s tructure/weir of an exis ting s pillway can be partially or fully removed to facilitate the lowering of the res ervoir in the event of an emergency. The concrete control s tructure is typically us ed in earth cut s pillways as a grade fill. If blasting is employed to remove the concrete, caution should be taken to ensure that the blasting does not cause additional damage to the embankment dam or foundation. Controlled blasting techniques with minimum particle velocities can be used effectively to remove the concrete s tructure. Figure 155 s hows a concrete contr ol structure being par tially br eached to allow f or lower ing of the r eservoir. 11.4.5 Excavation of a tr ench through an earthcut spillway For embankment dams with an earthcut s pillway channel or emergency s pillway at one of the abutments , a trench can be excavated thr ough the dis charge channel to deepen and/or widen the exis ting s pillway dis charge channel. Care s hould be employed to ens ure that water being r eleased thr ough the new channel does not cause erosional headcutting of the channel, resulting in an uncontrolled larger-than\u00ad planned reservoir release. The trench should be excavated down to or into erosion- resistant materials, if possible. If not, the excavated channel should be protected by placing erosion-resistant materials in the channel, such as rock riprap, concrete rubble (if temporary), sandbagging, plastic sheeting, or geotextiles. The materials should be properly placed in the channel and s tabilized to prevent the materials from being washed away. If sandbagging is used in high velocity flows, the sandbags should be placed beginning near the edge of the f low, wher e the velocities are low, and wor king towar d the high velocity ar ea. The largest sandbag pos sible should be used, and the ends of the bags should be s ecurely fastened s o that mater ial is not washed out. 11.4.6 Excavation of a s pillway through the embankment dam abutment Similarly to excavating a channel through an exis ting earthcut s pillway, a trench can be excavated through the abutment of the embankment dam (figure 156) to provide emer gency r elease of the r eservoir, if required. The trench s hould be pr operly located to e nsure that uncontrolle d releases of the reservoir throug h the channel do not encroach upon the embankment dam and cause an unanticipated breaching of the embankment dam. Care should als o be employed to ens ure that the excavated channel does not cause larger-than-anticipated flooding downstream of the embankment dam. Construction and cautions similar to those mentioned in the previous section for the excavation of a trench through an exis ting earthcut s pillway should be employed. 284 to lower t he reservo ir. Figure 156.\u2014The owner of thi s embankment da m excavated a channel around the da m to pr event its overtoppi ng during a hurricane. 285 Conduits through Embankment Dams 11.4.7 Controlled breach of the embankment dam A controlled breach of the embankment dam is an alternative means that can be considered to lower the r eservoir to a s afe level in the event of an emer gency at a dam. The embankment dam can be partially or fully breached, depending on the situation or configuration of the dam. The breach location should be carefully selected. Cons ideration s hould be made to locate the br each wher e it can be controlled, the height of the embankment dam is the shortest, and the downstream consequences will be low. Local emergency res ponders should be involved with all planning for the breach, including any evacuation of the downstream population. The breaching of the embankment dam should be done in stages and in a controlled manner to ensure that a catastrophic failure of the embankment dam does not occur, causing unanticipated and unwanted downstream property damage or loss of life (figure 157). First, a dis charge channel s hould be excavated down the embankment downs tream face or abutment ar ea to convey the dis charging water safely to the downstream channel. This channel should be excavated down to or into erosive- resistant materials, if possible. If not, the excavated channel should be protected by lining the channel with er osion-resistant mater ials, such as rock riprap, concr ete rubble (if temporary), sandbagging, plastic sheeting, or geotextiles. The embankment dam can then be breached in a slow and staged operation. The embankment dam is first excavated down to a point that will allow a predetermined maximum amount of water to flow thr ough the br each. The initial f low of water through the br each should be as minimal as possible and allowed to s tabilize and diminis h before removing another small portion of the embankment dam. The excavation of the embankment material should be kept at a minimal amount to limit the quantity of water discharging thr ough the br each s ection at any time. This process can then be repeated until the desired breach dimensions have been obtained. If possible, a cofferdam should be ups tream of the ar ea to be br eached, which s erves to pr event a catastrophic failure, if the breached section begins to erode in an un controlled manner. See the Balman R eservoir Dam and Empire Dam case histories in appendix B for examples of controlled dam breaches to draw down reservoirs. 11.5 Gate or valve operational r estriction A gate or valve operational restriction is an emergency action used to lessen the risk associated with potential failure modes resulting from internal erosion or backward erosion piping, as discussed in chapter 7. The restriction is normally kept in force until the entir e conduit is restored to a s erviceable condition. The gate or valve operational restriction may require that the gate or valve not be operated at all or only be operated to such an opening as to keep the downstream conduit from pressurizing. The restriction typically applies to normal operating conditions. If an emer gency ar ises requiring reservoir evacuation, the r estriction could be r emoved. 286 Chapter 11\u2014Ap propriate E mergency Acti ons Figure 157.\u2014A controlled brea ch of a n embankment da m begins after the 45-yea r old CMP spi llway condui t colla psed a nd the la ke level began to r ise. In addition to the gate or valve operational restriction, other supplemental actions should be considered, such as: The reservoir water level may need to be r estricted below a cer tain water level. See section 11.6 for further guidance on implementing a reservoir restriction. A periodic monitor ing pr ogram (i.e., weekly) may need to be implemented, which includes observation and documentation of the s eepage outf low f rom the conduit. The upstream and downstream faces and the embankment dam crest above the conduit alignment s hould als o be vis ually ins pected. Periodic man- entry or CCT V ins pections (i.e., annual, s emi-annual) may need to be implemented to evaluate changing conditions with the conduit. The EAP may need to be implemented. The EAP may need to be updated to include specific discussion of the operational restriction. 11.6 Reservoir operating res triction A reservoir operating restriction is not an emergency action, only an interim measure. A reservoir ope rating restriction re quire s that the reservoir be operated to 287 Conduits through Embankment Dams maintain a water level below a cer tain elevation to r educe the r isk of inter nal erosion or backwar d erosion piping of the embankment dam to an acceptable level of risk. The water level s elected is typically lower than the nor mal water surface. The establishment of a reservoir operating restriction should consider not only the reduction of risk, but also potentially significant adverse impacts, such as: Limiting the operational flexibility of the res ervoir. Reducing or s everely curtailing water s torage availability for project purpos es. Severely compromising flood control operations. Endangering reservoir habitat. Sensitive and s ignificant cultur al resource sites may be expos ed mor e frequently, as the r eservoir is lower ed, and s ubject to vandalis m. During droughts, the reservoir could be severely reduced because of a lack of opportunity to store water as a buffer against drought. A reservoir restriction should remain in place until dam safety modifications have been completed or until a r eview of additional per formance data (i.e., s eepage [weir ] flows, piezometer data, settlement point data, and visual inspections) leads to other conclusions. 288 Chapter 12 Renovation of Conduits The selection of the proper method for renovation, replacement, repair, or abandonment of a conduit is very site specific. Many factors go into the selection of the method to be us ed. This chapter will addres s design and cons truction considerations for the renovation methods. Chapter 13 discusses replacement of conduits, and chapter 14 discusses repairs and abandonment of conduits. When evaluating older structures for renovation, the des igner should pr oceed with caution. Previous designs may have utilized differing criterion or loadings compared to what is used in modern conduit design. The designer should consider materials available at the time of construction, and changes in material properties, design practices, and construction methods. For example, reinforcing bars used in reinforced concr ete have under gone s ignificant changes in the las t 100 year s. Yield strengths, allowable stresses, bar shapes (e.g., plain round, old-sty le deforme d, twisted square), and splice lengths all have changed, compared to what is used today for modern structures. If original design information is not available, the designer will need to make cons ervative as sumptions . The des igner may find it beneficial to consult references that contain information on old design and construction methods. An example of this type of reference would be the ACI Detailing Manuals (available since 1947) (Concr ete Reinf orcing Steel I nstitute, 2001, p. 2). The des igner could utilize thes e manuals to determine typical reinforcement details commonly us ed during the period of design. The understanding of a historical timeline can often assist the designer with identifying conduits that may remain relatively free of long term deterioration and those that may require actions for renovation, replacement, or repair. Typically, timelines cannot specifically identify exact dates or structures when changes in methods or mater ials may have occur red becaus e mos t of the available inf ormation is based upon a collective understanding that evolved over a period of time. Available timelines in many cas es may be agency s pecific. An example of a his torical timeline developed by Reclamation is illustrated in figure 158. This timeline was developed based on significant events that have occurred in regards to their experience with concrete technology. Using a timeline such as this, if the designer knows the approximate date of construction for a particular conduit, a preliminary assessment of its likely condition can be made. 289 Conduits through Embankment Dams Late 1940' s: Alkali-silica r eactiv ity (ASR) reducing practices im plem ented 1933: Inter nal vibration of concr ented 1929: Basic elim inated Figure 158.\u2014An example of a historical timeline that can assist the designer in evaluating the condi tion of a condui t. The nation's inventory of embankment dams and the conduits within them are aging and deteriorating. Many conduits require renovation to avoid potential embankment dam failures. Many of these conduits are too small to enter for construction activities while renovating them to addres s this deterioration is sue. Traditionally, removal and replacement of the entire conduit has been one of the most frequently pursued alternatives, but one which can be very costly and time consuming. Removing and replacing the entire conduit requires excavation of a large portion of an existing embankment dam. Removal and replacement typically requires draining of the existing reservoir resulting in significant economic impacts. The large excavation of the embankment dam leads to safety concer ns for the downs tream population while the dam is in the breached condition, and concerns for the development of s eepage and eros ion within the recompacted earthfill en clos ure section (Cooper, Hall, and Heyder, 2001, p. 2). In recent year s, renovation has become a popular means of avoiding the tr aditional removal and replacement method. Methods for renovation include a variety of \"trenchless technologies.\" The term trenchless technology applies to the renovation of existing conduits without requiring complete excavation (open-cut) over the alignment of the conduit. Trenchless technology is rapidly evolving in response to the introduction of new materials, products, and installation systems (USACE, 2001d, p. 3). The users of this document are urged to always refer to the latest manufacturers' recommendations when considering trenchless technology. The mos t common renovation method is sliplining. Sliplining involves pulling or pushing a pipe of smaller diameter into the existing conduit and grouting the annulus . Flexible plas tic and s teel pipe has been s uccessfully utilized for s liplining. Another method that has been used in limited applications is plastic cured-in-place pipe lining. This involves the ins ertion of a membrane into the exis ting conduit, which is then cur ed in place, f orming a clos ely fitting plas tic pipe within the exis ting 290 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits conduit. See chapter 2 for discussion of materials used in the design and construction of conduits. 12.1 Sliplining Sliplining an exis ting conduit through an embankment dam generally cons ists of installing a new, s maller-diameter pipe into the conduit. The annulus between the new pipe and the exis ting conduit is grouted. New entr ance and ter minal s tructures are sometimes cons tructed if the exis ting s tructures were deter iorated or were required for removal to facilitate ins tallation of the s lipliner. Also, a filter diaphragm or collar is constructed around the downstream portion of the existing conduit. The advantages of sliplining an existing conduit through an embankment dam include: Excav ation.\u2014Excavation of the embankment dam is minimized. However, some excavation may s till be required on the ups tream and/or downs tream face of the embankment dam f or removal and r eplacement of the entr ance and terminal s tructures and for ins tallation of the filter diaphragm or collar. Maintain reservoir level .\u2014In some situations (i.e., conduit has upstream control), the reservoir can be maintained at its normal water surface, if the s lipliner can be installed from the downstream end of the conduit. Constructio n.\u2014The construction time is usually less, reducing impacts to downs tream us ers. Costs.\u2014Cons truction cos ts for s liplining are generally les s than for other conduit renovation or replacement methods. The disadvantages of sliplining an existing conduit through an embankment dam include: Deteriorated conditions .\u2014Sliplining is not appropriate for exis ting conduits in a significantly deteriorated condition or where the surrounding embankment has been damaged by internal erosion or backward erosion piping. Alignment limitations .\u2014For inacces sible conduits , sliplining is generally limited to conduits . However, in certain s ituations , sliplining may be applicable for conduits with minor changes in alignment. If the conduit is acces sible by man-entry, bends can usually be accommodated by using short sections of pipe. Specialized contractors .\u2014Specialized contr actors are needed s ometimes for installation of the s liplining and grouting of the annular s pace. 291 Conduits through Embankment Dams Loss of reservoir .\u2014The reservoir is typically drained to provide upstream and downs tream acces s to the conduit. If the existing conduit has experienced significant deterioration or damage, further consideration is required bef ore proceeding with s liplining. Further cons ideration should include: Collapse.\u2014If the existing conduit appears to be on the verge of collapse, this may be an indication of considerable disturbance or movement of material outside of the conduit. Seepage.\u2014The greater the s eepage f low, the mor e concer n that the f low regime could change cons iderably after s liplining, which could affect s afety of the embankment dam. A change in the f low regime could f orce seepage to f low along the exter ior of the conduit. Any evidence that the s eepage is under pressure from the reservoir head should be a consideration for replacement of the exis ting conduit in lieu of s liplining. Location.\u2014The location of any deterioration or damage within the existing conduit should be evaluated. Seepage upstream of a filter or impervious core may not be as much of a concer n as seepage downs tream of these features. Void.\u2014If a void exists behind an opening in the existing conduit, the conduit should probably be considered for removal and replacement. However, some consideration s hould be given to wher e the void is located (near the intake structure is less problematic than near the embankment dam center line). If the void does not s eem to be as sociated with much s eepage f low, this could be more of an indication that the void could be the r esult of erosive forces from the discha rges through the existing conduit a nd tha t sliplining ma y be a n option. In some cas es, it may be pos sible to fill the voids with grout. Sliplining of the existing conduit may not be economical, if extensive grouting of large voids along the outs ide of the conduit will be required prior to ins erting the HDP E slipliner . The cos ts involved s hould be compar ed to thos e required for removal and r eplacement of the conduit. Deterioration process .\u2014If deterioration of the existing conduit is caused by a corrosive pr ocess, then the us eful life expectancy of the exis ting conduit s hould be evaluated bas ed on the knowledge that deterioration will continue. Generally, the s lipliner s hould be des igned to accommodate all internal and external loadings without any support provided from the deteriorating conduit. If the existing conduit is expected to provide support for the new slipliner, and the lif e expectancy of the exis ting conduit is less than the lif e of the pr oject, then r emoval and r eplacement s hould be cons idered (figure 159). 292Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits Figure 159.\u2014The holes i n this CMP condui t wer e clearly visible after remo val.

The reader should understand that if the conduit is accessible by man- entry, variance from this guidance will be required. The most commonly used thermoplastic for sliplining is smooth walled HDPE pipe. PVC pipe has been used in limited applications for sliplining, but has a number of disadvantages as discussed in s ection 2.2.1. For this reason, only HDPE pipe will be discussed in this chapter. HDPE pipe us ed for s liplining s hould meet the requirements of AST M D 2447, D 3035, and F 714. Additional design and construction guidance is available from other sources, such as CPChem 's The Perform ance Pip e Engineering Ma nual (2003), NRCS's Structural Design of Flexible Co nduits (2005), Pla stic Pipe Institute (PPI) Handbook of Polyethylene Pipe, and the upcoming FEMA-sponsored \"best practices\" guidance document for plastic pipe used in dams (expected publication date, 2006). 12.1.1.1 Design considerations The des igner must evaluate a number of design par ameter s when cons idering HDP E pipe for us e in s liplining. A few of the mos t significant des ign parameters include: Seepage paths 293 Conduits through Embankment Dams Service lif e Initial inspection of the existing conduit Selection of the diameter and thicknes s Thermal expansion/contraction Stress cracking Joints Flotation Entrance and terminal structures These par ameter s are further discussed in the f ollowing par agraphs. On a cas e-by\u00ad case basis, the designer may need to consider additional parameters depending on the per formance cr iteria and des ign requirements of the s pecific application. Seepage paths .\u2014When an HDPE s lipliner ins tallation eliminates seepage into the conduit, the flow patterns within the surrounding embankment are changed and other undes irable seepage paths may develop. Any exis ting s eepage paths may exper ience an incr ease in flow. For instance, if an exis ting deter iorated conduit has acted as a drain and r educed the phr eatic s urface within the embankment dam, the phreatic s urface may incr ease and f orce flow thr ough the dam, (along the exter ior of the exis ting conduit) af ter slipliner installation. This seepage and the potential f or internal erosion or backward erosion piping along the conduit must be addressed by installing a filter diaphragm or collar at the downs tream end of the exis ting conduit. The filter diaphragm or collar should be designed to prevent migration of the fines in the embankment dam and should be placed around the entire circumference of the existing conduit. For guidance on the design and construction of the filters, see chapter 6. Service life .\u2014The service life for HDPE pipe is a function of the stress history of the pipe. A typical des ign calls for a 50- to 100- year service lif e. Initial ins pection of the exis ting conduit .\u2014A thorough inspection of the existing conduit is required prior to selecting the diameter of the HDP E slipliner . Depending on the diameter of the existing conduit, man-entry or CCTV inspection methods should be used; see section 9.5.2 for guidance on inspection of conduits. The condition of the existing conduit, existence of any protrusions or obstructions, joint offsets, amount of deflection, and evidence of leakage or movement of embankment materials should be determined. The existence of any deflections, 294Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits protrus ions, or irregularities in the exis ting conduit will control the s election of the slipliner diameter. The pulling or pus hing of a template (figures 160 and 161), inflatable pipeline sphere, or soft (typically open cell polyurethane foam) pig (figure 162) through the exis ting conduit is recommended. This will als o ensure that sliplining can be done without difficulty. Selection of the diameter and thicknes s.\u2014The selection of the diameter and thicknes s of the HDPE s lipliner s hould cons ider the following factors : Size and co nditio n of the existing conduit.\u2014The size of the existing conduit limits the diameter of the HDP E slipliner . Further, if the exis ting conduit has any protrusions or obstructions (i.e., deflection, joint offsets), the diameter of the HDPE slipliner may need to be made smaller to accommodate these restrictions. Discharg e requirements .\u2014At maximum full open operation, the HDPE slipliner should not flow greater than 75 percent full (i.e., 75 percent of the inside diameter) at the downstream end, to minimize the risk of surging or pressure flow developing in the conduit. Pressurized HDPE slipliners are not recommended for significant and high hazard embankment dams. However, an alternative to s ingle wall HDPE pipe is available. This involves the us e of a dual wall containment pipe; see the discussion later in this section for further information. HDPE pipe is very smooth. While the insertion of a new HDPE slipliner results in a s maller flow ar ea, the r educed f riction of the water passing thr ough the slipliner res ults in only minimal los ses of hydraulic capacity, if any. Typically, a new, s maller diameter HDP E slipliner has a hydr aulic capacity equal to or greater than the original conduit. For example, the Manning's \"n\" value for smooth walled HDPE pipe is 0.009, compared to 0.010 for s teel, 0.013 for concrete, and 0.022 for CMP. Clearance requirements fo r grouting of the annulus between the existing conduit and the HDPE slipliner .\u2014To maintain s ufficient clear ance dur ing the s liplining pr ocess, the outs ide diameter of the s lipliner should be at leas t 10 per cent s maller than the ins ide diameter of the exis ting conduit (AST M F 585). This clear dimens ion between the inter ior surface of the exis ting conduit and outs ide surface of the slipliner allows for problem-free installation and grouting of the annular space. The des igner needs to verify that the clear dimens ion will accommodate grout and vent pipes , when s electing the outs ide diameter of the HDP E slipliner . Internal and HDPE lipliner s hould be designed with the a ssumption tha t the existing pipe continues to deteriora te after renovation is completed and will provide no s upport. For this reason, the 295 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 160.\u2014Crossba r template attached to a CCTV camera-crawler to check for irregu larities in the CMP conduit. Figure 161.\u2014A horseshoe sha ped tem plate used for checki ng irregularities in a condui t. The tem plate is attached to the CCT V camera-crawler. 296 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation for ng irregularities in a condui t. HDPE s lipliner s hould res ist all internal and external loadings . Internal loadings consist of water pressure and vacuum. If calculations show that the HDPE slipliner is susceptible to internal vacuum pressures, provisions should be made in the design to provide a means of letting air (i.e., air vent or an air valve) into the HDPE slipliner just downstream of the gate or valve. If the HDPE s lipliner will have a downs tream control gate or valve and is designed to be pres surized, the des igner s hould cons ider the pos sibility that the gate or valve can be clos ed rapidly and caus e water hammer . Good pr actice r equires a properly des igned gate or valve to have a clos ure rate that pr events the development of s urge pres sures within the HDPE s lipliner. External loadings consist of soil and hydrostatic. In some situations, construction loadings from construction tr affic and gr outing may need to be analyzed. The des igner should evaluate potential modes of failure consisting of wall crushing, buckling, and deflection. Thermal expans ion/contraction .\u2014HDPE pipe has a relatively high linear coefficient of thermal expans ion. For the temper ature range between 22 and 86 \u00b0F , the linear coef ficient of thermal E x 10-5 in/in x \u00b0F) is compar s teel (6.7 x 10-6 in/in x \u00b0F). In designing an HDPE slipliner, means of addressing thermal expansion/contraction should be considered. In a buried application, such as a conduit, the temperature variation is usually small due to the insulating effect of the surrounding embankment on the conduit. 297 Conduits through Embankment Dams After the HDP E slipliner is placed within the exis ting conduit, time s hould be provided for its temperature to equalize prior to grouting. Typically, 24 to 48 hours should be adequate. However , the des igner should us e their own judgement and allow for additional equalizing time when ins tallations occur during periods of extreme temper atures. Circulating water in the s lipliner can as sist with the temperature equalization process. Nighttime installation may be another option to consider to reduce the ef fects of extreme temper ature. The use of ups tream and downs tream end res traints on the HDPE s lipliner will limit expansion/contraction. Once the HDPE slipliner is grouted in place, it should under go little expans ion/contr action. This is largely due to the low modulus of elasticity of the HDP E pipe. The HDP E slipliner may tr y to expand, but in a restrained condition it cannot mobilize forces of the magnitudes required to caus e expansion movement. Since HDPE pipe does not bond with the grout, the resistive forces are largely from the f riction along the HDP E pipe/gr out inter face. Therefore, thrust-accommodating end s tructures are gener ally not r equired for HDP E sliplined conduits. Stress cr ackin g.\u2014HDPE pipe failures are often attributed to the effects of environmental stress cracking (also called slow crack growth). This phenomenon can occur during the handling or installation of HDPE pipe. The HDPE pipe could be gouged, scratched, or kinked, resulting in a weak spot on the pipe wall. Subsequent operations of grouting the HDPE pipe or pressurizing the conduit result cracking of the weakened section. Specifying HDPE pipe made with ASTM D 3350 cell clas sification 345464C gr ade r esin provides the highes t level of resistance to s low growth cracking and can negate the pos sibility of this type of failure. This ensures a virgin, high-grade, very stiff resin which has been found highly resistant to environmental stress cracking. Other grades of resin often contain some percentage of low- grade r ecycled r esins. Joints.\u2014The most common method used to join HDPE pipe is heat fusion (ASTM D 2657). This method is also known as butt fusion. The butt fusion technique is a widely us ed and indus try-accepted heat f usion method f or joining s ections of smooth solid walled HDPE pipe. This method produces a joint that is watertight and is as strong or stronger than the HDPE pipe material itself, if performed correctly. A special machine (f igure 163) is used to tr im the ends of the pipes (facing or squaring off), align the ends of the pipe, heat both ends of the pipes to about 400 to 450 \u00b0F, and force the ends together under pressure. The melt bead size required for the thickness and diameter of the HDPE pipe determines how much pressure and time is needed for fusion of the joint. About 1 hour should be allowed for the joint to adequately cool after completion of the fus ion proces s (figure 164). Trial fus ions should be considered at the beginning of the day, so the fusion procedure and equipment settings can be verified for the actual jobsite conditions. Manufacturer's recommended procedures should always be observed for heat fusion. 298 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits Figure 163.\u2014HD PE pipe joi nt being fusi on welded. A small bead (f igure 165) is formed wher e the melted material is extruded from the joint. Beads appear on both the inside and the outside of the HDPE pipe. The need for bead removal is uncommon, but can be accomplis hed us ing special tools after the joint has throughly cooled to ambient temper ature. If removal is necessary, the personnel using the debeading tool should be properly trained, so the HDPE pipe is not needles sly gouged. The exis tence of the inter ior bead has a negligible impact on the hydraulic performance of the s lipliner . A bead exis ts on the exter ior surface of the joint. If proper annulus clearance is provided by the des igner, this should not affect s lipliner ins ertion or the grouting process. The beads should be throughly inspected for uniformity and proper size around the entire joint. Visual ins pection is usually adequate; however other methods, such as radiographic or ultrasonic methods, can be used. The use of fusion machine oper ators who are s killed, knowledgeable, and certified by the manufacturer will produce a good quality joint. Improperly heat fused joints cannot be repaired and must be cut out, and the ends Figure 164 .\u2014Finished fusion welded joint. Figure 165.\u2014Interior view of finished joi nt bea d. 299 Conduits through Embankment Dams must be properly joined (ASTM D 2657). Upon completion of the repair, the HDPE s lipliner s hould be retes ted for leaks . Unlike bell and spigot pipe, such as PVC, heat fusion creates a continuous joint-free pipe of nearly constant outside diameter. Bell and spigot joints are susceptible to separation as the embankment dam s ettles. Becaus e the HDP E slipliner joint does not take up a large part of the original conduit, a larger ins ide diameter s lipliner can be us ed. This is an advantage when compar ed to f langed joints . During cold weather , additional time is required to war m up the f usion machine and to heat the ends of the HDP E pipe. A shelter (figure 166) may need to be constructed f or joining the s ections of HDP E pipe in cas e of inclement weather . For additional cold weather procedur es, see AST M D 2657. Other joining methods for HDPE pipe include: Joints made by extrusion (i.e., elbows, bends, and can be joined to the HDP E slipliner with heat f usion (AST M D 3261) in the field us ing an extrus ion gun. The extrus ion gun (figure 167) is a hand held extr uder that pr eheats the s urface of the HDP E pipe and f eeds a molten bead of polyethylene into the joint. Extrusion-welded joints are not as strong as butt fusion joints. Proper training is required for using the extrusion gun. Extrusion welding has been s uccessfully us ed for connecting HDP E grout Figure 166.\u2014Cold wea ther shelter constr ucted for joining H DPE pipe. 300 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits Figure 167.\u2014Hand held ex trusion gun. Figure 168.\u2014HDPE grout pi pe attached to H DPE sli pliner. and air vent pipes to the slipliner (figure 168). Extrusion welding cannot be used to repair damaged HDPE pipe. Mechanical jo ints.\u2014The mos t common mechanical joint is the f lange adapter . Flanged connections are often used to connect HDPE pipe to steel pipe. The flange adaptor consists of a stub end, which is typica lly butt fused to the HDPE pipe, and a flanged end, which is joined with bolts and nuts to the flanged end of another pipe. Flanged connections allow for easy assembly and disassembly of the joint. Flange joints tend to require more a nnula r space tha n butt fusion joints . 301 Conduits through Embankment Dams Other jo ints.\u2014Some HDPE pipe products have integral threads or snap joints that allow s ections to be eas ily joined without s pecial equipment. However , these should only be used for nonpressurized applications in low hazard embankment dams due to the potential for pullout. Some types of plastic pipe use gasketed or glued bell and spigot joints. HDPE pipe cannot be joined by threading or solvent bonding. Flota tion.\u2014When grouting an HDPE s lipliner within an exis ting conduit, it is likely that the s lipliner will \"float\" or be dis placed upward by the fluid pres sure of the grout in the annulus between the exis ting conduit and s lipliner . Due to the r elatively light weight of HDPE pipe, floatation can be more pronounced with this material. Floating of the s lipliner may not allow f or grout to completely encas e the HDP E pipe and ther efore reduce the over all strength of the s tructure. Floatation can als o result in vertical mis alignments , which may alter the hydraulics of a conduit, especially one that would flow under open channel conditions. Steps should be taken to address this floating potential, such as using spacers or blocking between the exis ting conduit and the s lipliner . Figur e 169 s hows an example of spacers being attached to the HDP E slipliner by extr usion welding. Some manufacturers have recommended that the HDPE pipe be filled with water to reduce flotation of the pipe during grouting. However, this does not always prevent flotation, because water is not as dense as the surrounding grout, and blocking is still neces sary. Other manufacturers strongly advis e agains t filling the HDPE pipe with water and instead recommend properly installed blocking and staged grouting. HDPE pipe is flexible and can conform to alignment changes; therefore, a larger HDPE s ection is more applicable than a rigid s lipliner s ection, s uch as steel. This tends to gr eatly minimize the potential dis tance an HDP E slipliner can f loat (i.e., by reducing the s ize of the annulus ) and r educes the potential adver se effects of any displacement. One caution is that s ince the HDPE s lipliner is more flexible, it may require more spacers than a rigid line r for the same span lengths, to c ontrol floatation, and pr ovide s ufficient r oom to f ully encas e the liner . However , if the alignment in the exis ting conduit varies , then the flexible liner will adapt more eas ily to the alignment, but will s till require s ufficient s pacers to ens ure adequate encas ement. Spacer s extending the f ull length of the HDP E slipliner are not recommended. Spacers should be des igned to allow grout to fill the annulus between the exis ting conduit and the HDP E slipliner . The type and s pacing of spacers will vary depending on the s tandard dimens ion ratio (SDR) of the HDPE slipliner and should be based on the recommendations of the HDPE pipe manuf acturer. Entrance and terminal s tructures .\u2014The sliplining of an exis ting conduit may require partial or full removal and replacement of certain s tructures to improve releas e capabilities or to facilitate cons truction. Figure 170 s hows an intake s tructure 302Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits Figure 169.\u2014Spacers being attached an HDPE slipliner using an extrusion gun.

For guidance on the des ign and cons truction of entrance and ter minal s tructures, see section 3.4. Specially f abricated s teel tr ansitions are sometimes used at the cr itical upstream end of a conduit being sliplined with HDPE pipe. The transition and HDPE pipe are connected using a flanged joint. 12.1.1.2 Cons truction cons iderations The des igner must evaluate a number of cons truction par ameter s when cons idering HDPE pipe for us e in s liplining. A few of the mos t significant parameters include: Sample tes ting and cer tification Handling and storage Installation Repairs to the HDPE slipliner prior to or during the insertion process Grouting Postinspection and acceptance Maintenance and repair of the completed HDPE slipliner Alternatives to sliplining exis ting conduits with s olid walled HDPE pipe These par ameter s are further discussed in the f ollowing par agraphs. On a cas e-by- case basis, the designer may need to consider additional parameters, depending on the construction requirements of the specific application. Sample testing and certification .\u2014 Manufacturer's certification should be furnished prior to any shipment of HDPE pipe to the worksite. The certification provides proof that the HDPE pipe was manufactured, sampled, tested, and inspected in accor dance with AST M F 714 and meets the r equirements . More details can be obtained by requesting the actual test data from the manufacturer. Not all HDPE pipe is tested; manufacturers may only test certain lots of pipe or perform testing at regular, s cheduled intervals . Handling and s torage .\u2014HDPE pipe is much lighter than steel or concrete pipe and generally does not require heavy lifting equipment. HDPE pipe is shipped in longer lengths than steel or reinforced concrete pipe due to its lighter weight. 304 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits HDPE pipe should be carefully handled and stored according to all of the manufacturer's recommendations. The manufacturer often ships handling instructions with the HDPE pipe. Cold weather handling precautions should be used to eliminate any impacts on HDP E pipe when temper atures are at or below freezing to avoid fracturing of the pipe. Handling of HDPE pipe when the temperature is below -10 \u00b0F is not recommended. The pipe should not be dropped or allowed to be dumped when off-loading. Strap s lings should be utilized for straight HDPE pipe and the use of chains and hooks should be avoided. Lifting points should be well spread and evenly spaced. The HDPE pipe should be fully inspected at the time of deliver y, with any def ects noted. The HDP E pipe s hould be stacked on firm, flat ground, adequately supported, kept away from heat sources, and kept in original protective packaging until used. Pipes should not be stacked higher than five units or 10 feet, whichever is less. Stacking pipe with differing wall thicknesses and pre ssure ratings shoul d be avoided. Testing has show n tha t unlike PVC, HDPE pipe does not become brittle under exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This resistance to UV radiation is the result of the small percentage of carbon-black which is added to the HDPE pipe material during the manufacturing process. Since vir tually all conduits are bur ied, such expos ure is gener ally minimal. Installation .\u2014HDPE pipe is a flexible material and, as such, can easily accommodate minor changes in vertical and horizontal alignment of the existing conduit being lined. Guidance on s liplining ins tallation includes : Preparation of existing surfa ces.\u2014The exis ting conduit s urfaces that grout will be placed against need to be free of roots, sediments, mineral deposits, dust, latence, loose or defective concrete, curing compound, coatings, and other foreign materials. Any sediments or debris should be removed from the invert of the existing conduit. Any bolts or other projections should be cut off flush and/or ground smooth with the interior surface of the existing conduit. See section 9.6 for guidance on cleaning conduits. A thorough ins pection of the exis ting conduit is required prior to ins talling the HDPE slipliner to ensure that no obstructions remain that may hinder slipliner insertion. Prior to s lipliner ins ertion, a s oft pig or inflatable pipeline s phere of the same diameter as the HDPE pipe should be pulled through the existing conduit to check for proper clearance. Consideration should be given for adequate spa cers a nd grout pipes to be a ttached to the HDPE slipliner. Leak testing of joints .\u2014Hydrostatic testing of the joints is required and should be done prior to installation, using a sustained pressure test to find leaks in the HDPE s lipliner. Prior to performing the hydros tatic tes t, the s lipliner s hould be properly restrained from movement. Depending on the limits of the testing equipment, the entire length of HDPE slipliner can be tested at one time or the test can be s eparated into s horter s ections . If a leaking joint is found, it will 305 Conduits through Embankment Dams need to be cut out and a new section of HDPE pipe installed and the ends of the pipe heat fused together. Further guidance on leak testing is provided in CPChem's Performance Pipe T echnical Note 802 (2002) and AST M F 905. Access a nd insertion .\u2014HDPE pipe is light in weight relative to more traditional pipe materials , and as such is easier to ins ert into exis ting conduits . Pulling, pushing, or a combination of both are the typical methods for slipliner insertion. Backhoes, bulldozers, and winches have been used to assist with the slipliner ins ertion (figure 171). The HDPE slipliner should be inserted following an approved installation plan, manuf acturer's recommendations , and AST M F 585. Sufficient wor k area mus t be available at the downstream toe of the embankment dam for insertion of the slipliner. For small embankment dams, smooth walled HDPE pipe sections can be fused into one long section on the crest of the dam and transported to the downs tream toe. The HDP E slipliner is then ins erted into the downs tream end of the conduit and simply pushed upstream. For larger embankment dams, access to both the upstream and downstream portals should be obtained, so the fused sections of HDPE pipe can be pulled through the existing conduit with the us e of a s pecial pulling head attached to the s lipliner. The pulling head des ign is based upon the axial pulling (tens ile) stress. The axial pulling s tress can be es timated by dividing the force of the pull load by the Figure 171.\u2014Insertion of an HDPE slipliner into an existing concrete condui t. A backhoe i s being used to a ssist with slipliner insertion. 306 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits cross-sectional area of the pipe wall thicknes s. The pulling load is a function of many var iables , such as the weight of the s lipliner and f rictional dr ag. A var iety of pulling head configurations are pos sible, depending upon the application. Approved manufacturer pulling head recommendations should be followed. The nos e cone pulling head (als o known as the banana nos e or s oft nos e) is a simple and cos t effective configuration to us e where the pulling s tress on the HDPE s lipliner is less than 700 lb/in2. The nos e cone pulling head is made from a few extra feet of HDPE pipe that has been fused onto the slipliner. Evenly s paced wedges are cut into the leading edge of the pulling head. A couple of alter natives exist for the nos e cone conf iguration: (1) the wedges are collaps ed towar ds the center to form a cone and f astened together with bolts . A pulling cable is attached to s econdary bolts that extend acros s the collaps ed nose (figure 172) and (2) holes are drilled through the wedges and cables or narrow plates are attached to the wedges . The cables or plates are attached to a pull ring (figure 173). If the s liplining application requires higher pulling s tresses, the manufacturer should be cons ulted for s pecialty pulling head configurations . Fabricated mechanical pulling heads are available. Blocks of wood or other material (called blocking or bridging) should be attached to the top of the HDPE s lipliner, s o that the s lipliner will not contact the top of the existing conduit. Once the slipliner insertion (figure 174) begins, it should continue without any s toppage until completion. The pulling method will res ult in s ome stretching of the HDPE s lipliner (1 percent of the total length). The slipliner will als o experience differential temperatures before and Figure 172 .\u2014Nose of HDPE slipliner modified for pulling into an existing conduit.

Allowances for these changes in HDP E slipliner length need to be cons idered during insertion (figure 175). A 24-hour relaxation period is recommended to allow the s lipliner to recover its length. In some instances, a vertical riser pipe that is connected to the horizontal conduit may be required (typically as sociated with s ervice or auxiliary s pillways ). The connection of the HDPE slipliner to a riser pipe can be somewhat difficult. A cus tom tr ansition piece may need to be f abricated. Sometimes the r iser can be removed and replaced with a new s tructure that facilitates a mechanical connection to the conduit slipliner. Repairs to the HDPE s lipliner prior to or during the ins ertion proces s.\u2014 Damage to the HDPE slipliner may occur from improper shipping and handling or from poor insertion technique. Damage can be in the form of kinks, punctures, breaks, or abrasion. HDPE pipe that undergoes this type of damage cannot be repaired, and the damaged section of pipe should be removed and replaced. The damaged section of HDPE slipliner should be cut out and a new section of pipe installed. The HDPE slipliner should be cut one pipe diameter on each side of the damaged area. The ends of the existing pipe and replacement pipe should be heat fused together. 308 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits Figure 175.\u2014Thi s gap shows tha t the desi gner di d not a dequately consi der the potenti al for thermal expansion/contr action dur ing installation of thi s HDPE slipliner. To avoid this pro blem, the HDPE slipliner sho uld have been designed to ex tend beyond the end of the ex isting condui t. Grouting .\u2014Car eful grouting of the annular space between the exis ting conduit and the HDPE s lipliner is essential. This can be a complex proces s, requiring the exper ience of a qualif ied contr actor. Full encaps ulation f or the entir e length of the annulus rarely is achievable, and the HDPE s lipliner is typically des igned to withs tand all internal and external loadings independently from exterior conditions . A lightweight, low dens ity grout containing no aggregate will ens ure the bes t result. The following guidance discusses the grout pl an, mix design, sequencing, and injection: Grout plan .\u2014A grouting plan detailing the contractor's grout mix equipment, setup, procedures, sequencing, plan for handling waste, method for communication, and method for sealing and bulkheading the upstream and downstream ends should be submitted for review and approval prior to initiation of grouting operations. Grout mix .\u2014The grout mix, cons isting of water , cement, f lyash, and chemical admixture must remain fluid and not thicken for at least 2 hours. Premature thickening of the grout will res ult in high injection pres sures, and inadequate support of the HDPE slipliner. Cement meeting AST M C 150, type I I is gener ally cons idered acceptable f or use in grout mixes for injection. Other types may be considered based on particular applications . The chemical admixture us ed will depend upon the type 309 Conduits through Embankment Dams of injection application. High-range, water-reducing, shrinkage-compensating, plasticizing admixtures may be beneficial. The grout s hould be tes ted in accor dance with AST M C 939. The des ign should s pecify mix des ign, dens ity, vis cosity, maximum injection pres sure, initial set time, 24-hour and compres sive strength, s hrinkage, s tability, and \"bleed\" or fluid loss. A minimum design compressive strength of 4,000 lb/in2 at 28 days is gener ally acceptable. The grouting contractor must have dependable equipment of a size that will allow the grouting to be done quickly. The contractor must also have backup equipment available and r eady at the s ite. Any gr out not us ed af ter 20 minutes should be was ted. Grouts are susceptible to degr adation by exces sive water infiltra tion before the grout sets. Extensive use of flya sh aggravates this problem. Therefore, flyash-based lightweight gr outs are not r ecommended. Sequencing and injection .\u2014The grouting equipment should be capable of mixing and delivering the grout at a rate that will allow the annular s pace to be entirely filled in a continuous operation, unles s staged grouting is being us ed. The contractor should monitor the grout pressure. If the existing conduit has deflected vertically from a s traight alignment, trapped air could res ult in a void in the grout. Grout injection can be accomplished by a number of methods, including gravity and pr essure: 1. Gravity.\u2014 Injection of grout into the annular space starts at the upstream end of the HDP E slipliner and pr ogresses towar d the downs tream end, s o as to more eas ily dis place water and debris . Suitable injection tubes must be inserted at the upstream end. Vent pipes installed at the downstream end should be 150 percent larger than injection tubes, to minimize the potential f or clogging. Dirty water and exces s grout dis charged from the downstream vent tube should be collected and disposed of properly. Grouting should continue until heavy grout exits from the downstream vent tube. 2. Pressure .\u2014HDPE grout pipes (typically 1 to 1\u00bd-inch diameter) are extrus ion welded to the crown of the s lipliner prior to ins tallation. The designer will need to determine the required number and length of each individual grout pipe. The number of grout pipes required for a particular sliplining application is a function of the diameter of the pipe and the expected length of grout tr avel, once it leaves the end of the gr out pipe. A rule of thumb used by R eclamation assumes about 25 to 30 feet of grout travel from the end of the grout pipe. For example, if a deteriorated outlet 310 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits works conduit (150 feet in length) is to be s liplined, 4 grout pipes (120, 90, 60 and 30 f eet in length) would be needed to gr out the annulus . Bulkheads are placed around the annulus of the slipliner at both ends of the conduit to contain the grout. The bulkheads must be secured in place and s ealed, s o no leakage of grout will occur during grouting operations . Air vent bleeder systems are installed through the bulkheads, near the crown of the existing conduit at both ends of the conduit to prevent air and bleed water from being trapped within the annular space. Injection of grout into the annular space starts at the downs tream end of the HDPE slipliner and progresses upstream through the longest grout pipe first, while low pressure air (5 lb/in2) is pumped through the downstream air vent. The air pressure assists in holding the grout in the annulus space. Grout pressures should be kept as low as possible to avoid collapsing the HDPE slipliner. As grouting begins, the upstream air vent through the bulkhead remains open until grout begins to flow from the vent, and then the vent is closed. Grouting continues in the longest pipe until no air returns from the next longest pipe, or grout no longer flows through the longest pipe. The longest pipe is plugged and grouting is initiated on the next longest grout pipe and the sequence is repeated for this pipe. Pumping of air in the air vent is discontinued when the shortest grout pipe on the conduit is being grouted. Grouting of the last grout pipe is continued until the annular space is fully grouted. When the annular space is fully grouted and heavy grout returns from the downstream air vent, a grout pressure of 10 lb/in2 is maintained for 10 minutes to ens ure all voids are filled. Postinspection and acceptance .\u2014The completed HDPE s lipliner (figure 176) should be visually inspected by trained personnel to evaluate the conditions within the renovated conduit. If the s liplined conduit is too s mall for man- entry inspection, CCTV inspection methods should be used. Some designers may want to consider the us e of white or gray HDP E pipe to r educe glar e using CCT V equipment, f igure 177 shows an example of this type of pipe. See section 9.5.2 for guidance on inspection of conduits. No localized dimpling or distortion of the HDPE slipliner wall or infiltration of groundwater or grout should be present. Maintenance and repair of the completed HDPE s lipliner .\u2014No maintenance is typically required for the HDPE sliplined conduit, unless the conduit requires some type of cleaning. Periodic operation of the conduit usually is sufficient to flush sediments through the system. HDPE pipe is smooth and generally resists the adherence of sediment deposits. See section 9.6 for guidance on cleaning of conduits. 311 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 176.\u2014Com pleted H DPE sli pliner in existing CMP condui t. Photo cour tesy of Ma ryland Da Safety Division. If the HDP E slipliner exper iences some type of damage over the long ter m, the damage should be assessed by trained personnel using man-entry or CCTV inspection methods as discussed in section 9.5. Repair of HDPE pipe after installation and grouting is completed is not practicable for the buried sections of pipe. Very little can be done to ef fectively r epair the exis ting HDP E slipliner in buried sections of pipe within the embankment dam. However, another HDPE slipliner of s maller diameter can us ually be ins erted and grouted in place. Sections of HDPE pipe that are exposed and accessible may be repaired by cutting out the damaged section and replacing the entire section of pipe. Further guidance on replacement and methods available for joining pipe are provided in CPChem's The Perform ance Pipe Engineering Manual (2003). For examples of projects that have utilized HDPE s liplining, s ee the cas e histories in appendix B for Round Rock and Twin (Turtle) Dams. Alternatives to sliplining exis ting conduits with s olid walled HDPE pipe .\u2014A newer application of HDP E pipe f or sliplining exis ting conduits involves the us e of dual containment HDPE pipe. This application is recommended, if the HDPE slipliner is to be pressurized. Dual containment HDPE pipe is manufactured as two separate HDPE pipes and assembled by placing one inside the other. The inside pipe (containment pipe) is centered within the outer pipe (carrier pipe) with end spacers (centr alizer s) located at each end of a section of pipe. The end s pacers are fabricated f or a tight f it and ar e extr usion welded to the dual wall containment pipe. 312 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits Figure 177.\u2014Whi te HDPE pipe ca n reduce glare when usi ng CCTV i nspecti on equi pment. Intermediate s pacers (known as spiders) are placed at inter mediate points between the end s pacers to pr ovide additional s upport. The distance between the s piders is a function of the pipe diameter and wall thicknes s. Large diameter , thick walled pipe does not r equire the s piders to be as close as small diameter , thin walled pipe. The joints of the dual containment pipe are joined using the same heat fusion method, as used for joining s ingle walled HDPE pipe. The annulus between the exis ting conduit and the outs ide pipe is grouted. However , the annulus between the ins ide and outs ide pipe of the dual containment pipe remains open, even af ter installation of the end s pacers and s piders, and upon completion of the heat fusion of the joints. This is one of the most desirable aspects of this type of pipe. The open annulus allows downstream detection of any leakage from the ins ide pipe, while s till having full containment protection provided by the outside pipe. The end s pacers and s piders are des igned with openings to allow any leakage to pas s through the annulus between the two pipes and exit at a downs tream location. The dual containment pipe provides a redundancy and additional safety factors to the system. The inside pipe is rated at 75 percent of the normal bursting pressure due only to the inability to ins pect the outs ide surface of the heat fus ion joints . For this reason, the ins ide pipe is typically des igned for a 33 percent higher pressure than the outside pipe. When s liplining an exis ting CMP, the CMP is typically as sumed to be corroded to the point that it cannot be relied upon to provide any strength. With the dual containment HDPE pipe, both pipes can be designed for the full expected loading. This allows a factor of safety of at least 2 without relying on exterior conditions, such as the existing CMP or the annulus grouting. 313 Conduits through Embankment Dams An additional benefit of the dual containment pipe is that the inside pipe is not subjected to any outside protrusions within the existing conduit that could possibly damage the pipe. The inside pipe is protected by the outside pipe, so if there is any damage the outs ide pipe will protect the ins ide pipe. Figure 178 s hows an example of dual containment pipe. Dual containment HDP E pipe weighs appr oximately twice as much as a solid walled pipe with a diameter equal to the outs ide pipe. The cos t for mater ials and installation of the dual containment pipe is typically slightly more than twice what a solid walled pipe might cos t. The higher cost is mainly due to incr eased labor required for heat fusion and installation of the dual containment pipe. When s liplining an exis ting conduit with a s olid walled HDPE pipe, the dis charge capacity is normally not r educed becaus e any los s in flow ar ea is compens ated by the smoother surface of the HDPE pipe in comparison to CMP, concrete, etc. This is due to the extr emely low hydr aulic f riction in the HDP E pipe. With the dual containment pipe, the cr oss sectional ar ea is further reduced by the s maller diameter of the ins ide pipe. The smaller cros s sectional flow area may res ult in a net los s in discharge capacity compar ed to the or iginal capacity of the exis ting conduit. The loss in capacity is dependent on the diameter of the inside pipe of the dual containment pipe. The loss in dis charge capacity will be a s maller percentage of the original capacity as the exis ting conduit diameter gets larger. Figure 178.\u2014A 14-inch diameter interior HDPE pipe is being inserted into a 20-inch diameter outsi de pipe. Interm ediate spa cers are used to keep the interior HDPE pipe center ed and suppor ted. The a nnulus g routing between the ex isting CMP a nd exterior HDPE pi pe ha s com pleted. 314 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits HDPE joint fus ion machines require s pecialized contractors , and mobilizing them to a construction site can add to the cost of a sliplining project, especially for smaller embankment dams. For some nonpressurized projects in low hazard embankment dams, an alternative product, such as \"Snap-Tite\u00ae\" may be used. This proprietary product consists of gasketed joint grooves machined onto lengths of standard HDPE pipe. This alternative is not appropriate for use with pressurized conduits, due the pos sibility of leakage through the gas keted joints . This type of pipe is lightweight, and sections of the pipe can be easily handled by three or four workers and a backhoe (figure 179). After the first section of the pipe is inserted into the existing conduit, the next s ection is aligned with the f irst section and the joint is lubricated and pulled together with \"come-along hoists\" and chains wrapped around the liner. As in the us ual method of ins talling HDPE s lipliner, the firs t section of the pipe is tapered to allow the leading edge to ride over irregularities in the exis ting conduit. The joined sections of pipe can be pulled or pushed into the existing conduit. Pulling from the ups tream end is preferred, becaus e in s ome cas es, exces sive force us ed to pus h the liner from the downs tream end has damaged s ome joints. The blocking and grouting procedure would be the same as that for fused HDPE pipe. For further design and installation details, see the manufacture's data. The primary advantage of using Snap- Tite ins tead of standar d heat- fused HDP E pipe is reduced ins tallation cos ts, since a f usion machine is not needed. Disadvantages include the high cost of the proprietary pipe (due to the cost of machining of the joint grooves ) and that the product has a relatively thin wall, s o it may not be suitable under high embankment dams. The product usually consists of Figure 179.\u2014Secti ons of propri etary Sna p-Tite\u00ae pi pe handled with sm all equi pment. 315 Conduits through Embankment Dams pipe with an SDR of 26 or 32.5, although heavier pipes may be available for custom applications . The des igner will need to evaluate the s uitability of this type of product for their project. For an example of a conduit renovation at a low hazard embankment dam us ing Snap-T ite, see the Rolling Green Community Lake Dam case history in appendix B. 12.1.2 Steel pipe In mos t applications , steel pipe s lipliner s are used within acces sible conduits . Section 12.1.2 mainly pertains to conduits accessible by man-entry. However, some discussion of steel pipe slipliners used within inaccessible conduits is provided. Steel pipe s lipliners (figure 180) are generally applicable, if the exis ting conduit is straight and does not have bends or significant invert slope changes. Steel pipe slipliners can be installed in conduits with bends or slope changes, if adequate clearance will allow for the ins ertion of the fabricated pipe s ections . 12.1.2.1 Design considerations The des igner must evaluate a number of design par ameter s when cons idering steel pipe for us e in s liplining. A few of the mos t significant des ign parameters include: Seepage paths Service lif e Initial inspection of the existing conduit Selection of the diameter and thicknes s Thermal expansion/contraction Stress cracking Fabrication Joints Flotation Entrance and terminal structures 316 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits Figure 180.\u2014The La ke Linganore Da m outlet works consi sts of a 48-in diameter RCP condui t with a sluice gate loca ted a t the dow nstream end, which places the condui t under full r eservoir head at all times. Concer n about the i ntegrity of the RCP joi nts led to i nstallation of a steel sli pliner when the i nopera ble slui ce gate wa s repla ced. These par ameter s are further discussed in the f ollowing par agraphs. On a cas e-by\u00ad case basis, the designer may need to consider additional parameters, depending on the per formance cr iteria and des ign requirements of the s pecific application. Seepage paths .\u2014For a dis cussion of s eepage paths refer to s ection 12.1.1. Service life .\u2014The service lif e of a steel pipe s lipliner is cons idered to be indef inite, if the coatings on the inter ior surface ar e properly maintained. However , impr oper maintenance of the interior surface could result in deterioration of a steel pipe slipliner in les s than 25 years . Protective coatings are rarely completely effective, because even on application, they contain discontinuities, such as pinholes, flaws, scratches, and connected porosity. The use of a cathodic protection system (CPS) may be applicable in certain situations. A CPS has been used in conjunction with protective coatings , have been effective in controlling corros ion. A CPS cons ists of anodes that pas s a dir ect cur rent to the s teel pipe liner through the electr olyte envir onment. With a CP S, the whole s teel pipe s lipliner becomes a cathode and does not corrode. CPSs can be one of two types, galvanic anode or impressed current anode. Hybrid CPSs can contain both types of anodes to provide protective current to all s urfaces of the protected s teel pipe s lipliner (USACE, 1999, p. 1-1). 317 Conduits through Embankment Dams Initial ins pection of the exis ting conduit .\u2014For a dis cussion of the initial inspection of an existing conduit refer to section 12.1.1. Selection of the diameter and thicknes s.\u2014The selection of the diameter and thicknes s of the s teel pipe s lipliner should cons ider the f ollowing f actors: Size and co nditio n of the existing conduit.\u2014Similar s ize and condition requirements are needed f or steel pipe s lipliner s as are used for the des ign of HDP E slipliners , see section 12.1.1 for further details . Discharg e requirements .\u2014Similar discharge requirements are needed f or steel pipe slipliners as are us ed for the des ign of HDPE s lipliners , see section 12.1.1 for furthe r details. Clearance requirements fo r grouting of the annulus between the existing conduit and the steel pipe slipliner.\u2014Similar clear ance r equirements are needed f or steel pipe s lipliner s as are us ed for the des ign of HDPE s lipliners , see section 12.1.1 for further details . However, it s hould be noted that flanged joints generally require more clearance than heat f used HDP E joints or welded s teel joints . Internal and e xternal loadings.\u2014Similar loadings can be expected on s teel pipe slipliners as are us ed for the des ign of HDPE s lipliners ; see section 12.1.1 for further details . Steel pipe s lipliner thicknes s requirements are generally governed by external pressure s and the pote ntial for buc kling during future unwater ing of the s lipliner . Steel pipe s hould be des igned in dance with indus try-accepted methods , such thos found in AWWA M 11 (AWWA, 2004c), Ams tutz (1970), and Jacobs en (1974). Thermal expans ion/contraction .\u2014Thermal expansion/contraction is generally not a concern with steel pipe slipliners, as long as it does not have any portion expos ed to the envir onment. Stress cr ackin g.\u2014Stress cracking is generally not a concern with steel pipe slipliners . Fabrication .\u2014Steel pipe us ed for s liplining s hould be fabricated in accordance with AWWA C200 (1997) and ASTM A 36 and A 53. The steel pipe slipliner should be hydrostatically tes ted at the f actory bas ed on the des ign pr essures. The steel pipe slipliner should be coated as specified by the des igner. To avoid delays to the construction schedule, the steel pipe slipliner should be shop fabricated while other s ite preparations for ins tallation of the s lipliner are being performed (e.g., construction access, or concrete removal). Depending on the diameter and length of the s teel pipe s lipliner , it may be advantageous to shop 318 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits fabricate the s lipliner in s ections , so finis hed sections can be ins talled while other segments are being fabricated. Sometimes a separate procurement contract for the steel pipe slipliner is issued early, so fabrication can begin sooner. Joints. - Steel pipe s lipliner joints should be welded in accordance with AWWA C206 (2005). Flanged s teel joint r ings with AWWA (2002). \"Full face\" rubber gaskets between the f langes are required in order to ensure a watertight joint. Fittings should have a factory-applied coating to protect against corrosion. Bolts should be of stainless steel or low allow steel and should be field coated after installation. Flota tion.\u2014Flotation is a concern for steel pipe slipliners, but not as much as it is for thermoplas tic slipliner s. The weight of the s teel pipe s lipliner helps to pr event it from being displaced upward by the fluid pressure of the grout in the annulus between the exis ting conduit and s teel pipe s lipliner . Spacer s or jack s crews are always required to s ecure the s teel pipe s lipliner from movement dur ing gr out placement. Entrance and terminal s tructures .\u2014The steel pipe sliplining of an existing conduit may r equire partial or full removal and r eplacement of certain s tructures to impr ove releas e capabilities or to facilitate cons truction. For guidance on the des ign and construction of entrance and ter minal s tructures, see section 3.4. 12.1.2.2 Cons truction cons iderations The des igner must evaluate a number of cons truction par ameter s when cons idering steel pipe for us e in s liplining. A few of the mos t significant parameters include: Handling and storage Installation Repairs to the steel pipe slipliner prior to or during the insertion process Grouting Postinspection and acceptance Maintenance and r epair of the completed s teel pipe s lipliner These par ameter s are further discussed in the f ollowing par agraphs. On a cas e-by\u00ad case basis, the designer may need to consider additional parameters, depending on the construction requirements of the specific application. 319 Conduits through Embankment Dams Handling and s torage .\u2014During loading, transportation, unloading, storage, and laying, ever y precaution s hould be taken to pr event damage to the s teel pipe s lipliner sections , linings , coatings flanges . pipe s lipliner s ections should be s tored on timber blocking and adequately protected from weather and damage. Any damage to lining or coating will need to be properly repaired. If proper repair cannot be made, the damaged s ection will need to be replaced. Installation .\u2014The steel pipe slipliner should be supported and braced to prevent distortion during installation and grouting. Spacers are required to maintain separation between the exis ting conduit and the s teel slipliner during gr outing. Figure 181 s hows spacers being ins talled on a s teel pipe s lipliner. Guidance on installation includes the following. Additional guidance on s teel pipe ins tallation is available in AWWA M11 (2004c). Preparation of existing surfa ces.\u2014The existing conduit surfaces, against which grout will be placed, s hould be free of latence, dirt, dus t, greas e, oil, loos e or defective concrete, curing compound, coatings, and other foreign materials. Any sediments or debris should be removed from the invert of the existing conduit. Any bolts or other projections should be cut off flush and/or ground smooth with the inter ior surface of the exis ting conduit. If the existing conduit is full of water, considerations should be made for unwatering. A thorough inspection of the existing conduit is required prior to installing the s teel pipe s lipliner to ens ure no obs tructions remain that may hinder s lipliner ins ertion. Leak testing joints .\u2014Steel pipe s lipliner joints should be welded and tes ted in accor dance with AWWA C206 (2005), except tes ting of field welds should be by the ultrasonic method. Ultrasonic examination of field welds should conform to the requirements of American Welding Society (AWS) D1.1 (2004). Any of fsets that could r educe the hydr aulic capacity of the s teel slipliner should be ground flush and flared into the adjacent surfaces. In lieu of ultrasonic examination, the f ield welded joints can be tes ted by the liquid penetr ant method in accor dance with AST M E 165. The liquid penetr ant method provides an indication of the pr esence, location, and to a limited extent, the nature and magnitude of any discontinuities. Welds can also be tested using radiographing and magnetic-particle methods. Access a nd insertion .\u2014The steel pipe s lipliner is typically ins talled by pulling, pushing, or a combination of both similar to an HDPE pipe as discussed in section 12.1.1. Repairs to the s teel pipe s lipliner prior to or during the ins ertion proces s.\u2014 Damage to the steel pipe slipliner may occur from improper shipping and handling 320 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits Figure 181.\u2014Spa cers bei ng installed on a steel pi pe sli pliner. or from poor insertion technique. Damage can be in the form of kinks, punctures, breaks, or abrasion. Steel pipe slipliners that undergo this type of damage can be easily repaired, if the pipe has not been inserted into the existing conduit. The repair would typically involve cutting out the damaged ar ea of steel pipe s lipliner and welding a new piece of steel plate in place. An ins talled s lipliner with a damaged ar ea can only be r epaired in place if it is of sufficient diameter to allow man- entry. If the steel pipe s lipliner diameter is too s mall for man-entry, the s ection of pipe will need to be removed to perform the proper repair. Grouting .\u2014Car eful grouting of the annular space between the exis ting conduit and the steel pipe s lipliner is essential. This can be a complex proces s, requiring the experience of a qualified contractor. A lightweight, low density grout containing no aggregate will ens ure the bes t result. The following guidance dis cusses the grout plan, mix design, sequencing, and injection: Grouting plan.\u2014A grouting plan detailing the contractor's grout mix equipment, setup, procedures, sequencing, plan for handling waste, method for communication, and method for sealing and bulkheading the upstream and downstream should be submitted for review and approval prior to initiation of grouting operations. The contractor should also provide the method to be used to remove trapped air from any high points in the existing conduit during the 321 Conduits through Embankment Dams grouting operation. All welding and inspection of the steel pipe slipliner should be completed before grouting operations commence. Grout mix .\u2014For guidance on grout mix, s ee section 12.1.1. The grout mix us ed for grouting of the annulus for a s teel pipe s lipliner will be s imilar to that us ed for grouting of the annulus of an HDPE slipliner. Sequencing and injection .\u2014For guidance on sequencing and injection of grout, see section 12.1.1. Grout injection can be accomplished by a number of methods, including gravity and pr essure: 1. Grouting for a ccessib le existing cond uits.\u2014 T hreaded couplings are ins talled through the steel pipe slipliner, from which grouting operations can be performed. After grouting operations have been completed, a pipe plug is installed in the threaded coupling, tightened, seal welded, and ground flush with the inter ior surface of the s teel pipe s lipliner . Grouting is best accomplis hed in lifts (four lifts are recommended for large diameter steel pipe s lipliner s). For each lif t, grouting s hould begin at the downs tream end of the conduit and pr oceed ups tream. Grout injection should begin at the lower ports in the steel pipe slipliner and progress to the next higher ports. Grouting should begin by injecting through the lower ports and continue until grout return is observed at the next higher ports. Recommended port locations are at the invert, 45 degr ees each s ide of the inver t, both s pringlines , 45 degr ees each s ide of the pipe crown, and the pipe crown. Grout s hould be pumped at pr essures not exceeding 10 lb/in2 at the injection ports. Any trapped air along the high points in the annular space should be expelled through air vents located on the crown. Rings of grout ports should be spaced at about 40-foot intervals. The designer should determine the required number and location of all ports and actual grouting pressures to be used. The steel pipe slipliner position, circularity, and shape should be monitored during grouting operations. Upon completion of grouting, grout plugs should be installed and ground flush with the s teel liner surface. 2. Grouting for ina ccessib le existing cond uits.\u2014 Grouting of s teel slipliners will be very s imilar to that us ed for grouting of HDPE s lipliners . The main difference being the us e of steel gr out and vent pipe, welded to the s teel slipliner. Full encaps ulation for the entire length of the annulus rarely is 322 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits achievable, and the s teel pipe s lipliner is typically des igned to withs tand all internal and external loadings independently from exterior conditions. Grout injection can be accomplished by a number of methods, including gravity and pr essure: Gravity.\u2014For guidance on gravity grouting, s ee section 12.1.1. Pressure .\u2014Steel pipe slipliner grout pipes (typically 1 to 1\u00bd-inch diameter ) are welded to the cr own of the s lipliner prior to installation. For guidance on pres sure grouting, s ee section 12.1.1. Postinspection and acceptance .\u2014Trained personnel should visually inspect the completed s teel pipe s lipliner ins tallation to evaluate the conditions within the renovated conduit. If the sliplined conduit is too small for man-entry inspection, CCT V ins pection methods should be us ed. See s ection 9.5.2 for guidance on inspection of conduits. No damage to linings or coatings, or infiltration of groundwater should be present. Maintenance and repair of the completed s teel pipe s lipliner .\u2014Maintenance typically performed on steel pipe slipliners involves coatings on the interior of the slipliner. The interior s urface of the pipe may require periodic recoating, if it has been subjected to abrasion or corrosion. The only other maintenance required for steel pipe slipliners would involve cleaning of the conduit. Periodic operation of the condui t usua lly is suffi cient to fl ush se diments throug h the system. The steel slipliner is smooth and generally resists the adherence of sediment. See section 9.6 for guidance on cleaning of conduits. If the s teel slipliner exper iences some type of localized damage (abr asion, buckling, cavitation, corrosion, etc.) over the long term, the damage should be assessed by trained personnel using man-entry or CCTV inspection methods as discussed in section 9.5. Repair of steel pipe slipliners after installation and grouting is completed can be accomplis hed, if the pipe is of sufficient diameter to allow man- entry. If the damaged ar ea of steel pipe is not extens ive, the r epair would typically involve cutting out the damaged ar ea and welding a new piece of steel plate in place or applying weld material in the damaged area. The welded material would be ground to a smooth f inish. If the s teel pipe s lipliner diameter is too s mall for man- entry, a s teel pipe s lipliner of s maller diameter can us ually be ins erted and grouted in place. For examples of projects that utilized s teel pipe s liplining, s ee the cas e histories for Como and McDonald Dams in appendix B. 323 Conduits through Embankment Dams 12.2 Cured-in-place pipe Plastic cur ed-in-place pipe (CI PP) liner s are typically us ed within inacces sible conduits . However, guidance provided in s ection 12.2 bas ically applies to lining of acces sible or inacces sible conduits . CIPP liner s are bes t suited f or existing conduits that are not severely damaged or deformed and have constant diameters and no sharp bends. The designer should consider the method of CIPP liner installation as part of the design process. CIPP liners can be inserted into the existing conduit by either the inversion method (ASTM F 1216) or Additional inf ormation on CI PP liner s used in s ewer and pipeline application is available in USACE's Guidelines for Trenchless Technology: C Microtunneling (1995d) and AST M D 5813. 12.2.1 Design considerations The des igner must evaluate a number of design par ameter s when cons idering CI PP lining for conduits . A few of the mos t significant des ign parameters include: Seepage paths Service lif e Initial inspection of the existing conduit Selection of the diameter and thicknes s Thermal expansion/contraction Stress cracking Fabrication Joints Flotation Entrance and terminal structures 324 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits These par ameter s are further discussed in the f ollowing par agraphs. On a cas e-by- case basis, the designer may need to consider additional parameters, depending on the per formance cr iteria and des ign requirements of the s pecific application. Seepage paths .\u2014For a dis cussion of s eepage paths , refer to s ection 12.1.1. Service life .\u2014Research conducted by the Trenchless Technology Center at Louisiana T ech Univer sity found that the s ervice des ign lif e of CIPP liner s gener ally exceeds 50 year s. The inver sion tube pr ocesses, in which a r esin-impregnated tube is cured in place, may not be suitable for lining bituminous coated CMP conduits unles s they ar e prelined to pr event contamination of the r esin by chemicals present in the as phalt coating (USACE, 1990, p. 3). Initial ins pection of the exis ting conduit .\u2014For a dis cussion of the initial inspection of an existing conduit refer to section 12.1.1. Selection of the diameter and thicknes s.\u2014The selection of the diameter and thicknes s of the CI PP liner should cons ider the f ollowing f actors: Size and co nditio n of the existing conduit.\u2014The size of the exis ting conduit will limit the diameter of the CIPP liner. A determination of the condition of the existing conduit is required to estimate the contributing support. A conservative assumption would be that the existing conduit is \"fully deteriorated.\" For this assumption, the existing conduit provides no contributing support, and the CIPP lining needs to carry the external and internal loads resulting from the embankment dam and hydrostatic water pressures. A less conservative assumption would be an existing conduit in a partially deteriorated condition. For this condition, the existing conduit is assumed to be able to accommodate all internal and external loads for the life of the renovated conduit. If the existing conduit is large enough for man-entry, spot repairs of deteriorated areas may be considered prior to CIPP liner placement. Discharg e requirements .\u2014Simila r disc harge require ments are needed for C IPP liners as are us ed for the des ign of HDPE s lipliners ; see section 12.1.1 for furthe r details. Clearance requirements .\u2014Grouting is not normally required, since the CIPP liner fits tightly a gainst the interior surfa ce of the existing conduit. However, the designer needs to clos ely evaluate the applicability of a CIPP liner used for lining of a CMP conduit. The CIPP liner cannot tightly fit within the corrugations , and the ability to grout this annulus would be difficult. 325 Conduits through Embankment Dams Internal and e xternal loadings.\u2014The CIPP liner des ign is based on the condition (partially or fully deteriora ted) of the existing conduit, the type of a pplica tion (pressurized or nonpressurized), and the resin and fabric tube material construction. If the existing conduit can support the soil and surcharge loads throughout the des ign life of the rehabilitated conduit, it is cons idered to be partially deteriorated for us e in computing the required des ign thicknes s. Typically, If the existing conduit is not structurally sound and cannot support soil and live loads or is expected to reach this condition over the des ign life of the rehabilitated conduit, it is cons idered to be fully deteriorated for us e in computing the des ign thicknes s. Other factors affecting the thicknes s of the CIPP liner are groundwater, soil types, and loadings on the existing conduit. Guidance f or design should be in accor dance with the manuf acturer's recommendations and ASTM F 1216. Proper precautions are required to provide required venting (i.e., air vent or an air valve) to avoid collapse by internal vacuum pre ssure s. Thermal expans ion/contraction .\u2014Thermal expansion/contraction are generally not a significant concern with CIPP. Stress cr ackin g.\u2014Stress cracking is generally not a concern with CIPP. Fabrication .\u2014The CIPP liner s hould be fabricated in a diameter s ize which will tightly fit the interna l circumference of the existing conduit a fter insta llation. Allowance should be made for any circumferential stretching during the inversion proces s. The volume of res in should be s ufficient to fill all voids in the tube material at nominal thicknes s and diameter . The resin volume may need to be adjus ted by adding 5 to 10 per cent exces s resin to account f or the change in volume due to polymerization and to allow for migration of resin into open cracks or joints in the existing conduit. Joints.\u2014Typically, CIPP liners are ins talled as one continuous length, and no joints are require d. Flota tion.\u2014Flotation is not an issue with CIPP, since the interior of the CIPP liner is filled with water during the curing proces s, and grouting is typically not required. Entrance and terminal s tructures .\u2014The installation of a CIPP liner into a exis ting conduit may r equire partial or full removal and r eplacement of certain s tructures to improve releas e capabilities or to facilitate cons truction. For guidance on the des ign and cons truction of entrance and ter minal s tructures, see section 3.4. 326Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation 12.2.2 Cons truction cons iderations des igner must evaluate a number of cons truction par ameter s when cons idering CIPP lining for conduits . A few of the mos t significant parameters include: Installation Repairs to the CIPP liner prior to or during the insertion process Curing Grouting Postinspection, tes ting, and acceptance Maintenance and r epair of the completed CI PP-lined conduit These par ameter s are further discussed in the f ollowing par agraphs. On a cas e-by\u00ad case basis, the designer may need to consider additional parameters, depending on the construction requirements of the specific application. Installation .\u2014Upstream and downstream access as typically required for installation. Installation s hould be in accor dance with the manuf acturer's recommendations and AST M F 1216 (invers ion method) and AST M F 1743 (pulled\u00ad in-place method). The manufacturer should provide the minimum and maximum allowable hydrostatic pressures. The use of a nontoxic lubricant is recommended to reduce f riction dur ing inver sion. The use of an exper ienced CI PP liner installer is highly r ecommended. Preparation of existing surfa ces.\u2014The existing conduit surfaces should be free of roots, sediments, mineral deposits, and loose or defective concrete. Any sediments or debris should be removed from the invert of the existing conduit. Any bolts or other projections should be cut off flush and/or ground smooth with the inter ior surface of the exis ting conduit. See s ection 9.6 f or guidance on cleaning of conduits. If the existing conduit is full of water considerations will be required for unwatering. A thorough ins pection of the exis ting conduit is required prior to ins talling the CIPP liner to ens ure no obs tructions remain that may hinder CIPP insertion. Access a nd insertion .\u2014Two methods of installation are available for insertion of the CI PP liner : 1. Inversion method.\u2014The inversion method (figures 182 through 184) consists of utilizing air or water (hydros tatic head) to pus h the CIPP liner ins ide\u00ad 327 Conduits through Embankment Dams out as it advances along the conduit. The inversion method is used for conduits with diameter s ranging f rom 4 to 108 inches . 2. Pulled-in-place method.\u2014The pulled-in-place method consists of a winch attached to a cable, which is attached to the CI PP liner and us ed to pull the liner into pos ition. The liner is then inflated through the invers ion of a calibration hose by the use of hydrostatic head or air pressure. The pulled- in-place method is usually only done wher e sufficient water pressures are not available or the scaffold towers required for the inversion process are not practical or where a particular lining is required. Insertion by the pulled-in-place method has some limitations due to the s ize and weight of the liner and pos sible res ulting damage by moving the liner through the existing conduit. The pulled-in-place method is used for conduits with diameter s ranging f rom 4 to 96 inches . Repairs to the CI PP liner prior to or during the ins tallation proces s.\u2014Damage to the CIPP liner may occur from improper shipping and handling or from poor installation technique. Damage can be in the form of punctures, breaks, or abrasion to the CIPP liner or improper injection and care of the liquid resin. CIPP liner that experiences this type of damage must be replaced. Curing.\u2014Af ter the CI PP liner is in place, a s uitable heat s ource, water recirculating equipment, and temper ature gauges are required to cir culate heated water throughout. Curing of the CIPP must consider the existing conduit, resin system, and the surrounding embankment conditions, including temperatures, moisture levels, and thermal properties. Curing should be in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and AST M F 1216. The cured CIPP liner will take the shape of the exis ting conduit, including any deformities . CIPP is usually thermally cured by the circulation of heated water (up to 82.2 \u00b0C or 180 \u00b0F). Alter native r esins can be us ed that r equire lower curing temper atures, if thermal stresses are a des ign concer n. However , once the cur ing pr ocess is complete, the CIPP liner is stable to heat and cannot be made to flow or melt again. Ultraviolet and ambient cure methods a re alterna tives to the therma l curing method, but these methods may have installation limitations or properties not equal to those of a thermally cur ed product. When completed, the CI PP liner acts as a new water tight lining within an exis ting conduit. After the cur ing pr ocess is completed, the ends of the CI PP liner can be tr immed f lush as needed. If a service connection or air vent opening is required, this can be done by personnel using a special cutting device for conduits large enough for man-entry. If the conduit is too small for man-entry, a robotic crawler with a special cutter can be used to cut the required opening in the CIPP line r. Grouting .\u2014Grouting is not normally required, since the CIPP liner fits tightly against the interior surfa ce of the existing conduit. 328 Chapter 12\u2014Renov ation of Conduits Figure 182 .\u2014Unloading the CIPP liner prior to installation. Figure 183 .\u2014CIPP liner being positioned for installation. Figure 184 .\u2014The hydrostatic inversion method is being used for CIPP liner installation into an existing conduit. 329 Postinspection, testing, and acceptance.\u2014 Trained personnel should visually inspect the completed CIPP installation. No dry spots, lifts, delamination, pinholes, or infiltration of groundwater should be present and the CIPP liner should be in a fully expanded condition. Wrinkles (figure 185) that could reduce the hydraulic capacity of the CIPP liner should not be allowed. If the CIPP-lined conduit is too small for man-entry inspection, CCTV inspection methods should be used. See section 9.5.2 for guidance on inspection of conduits. Two samples (cut from the end of the cured CIPP liner) should be prepared and submitted for the purpose of acceptance testing. The samples should be prepared in accordance with ASTM F 1216 or ASTM F 1743 for flexural and tensile testing. Testing should be used to verify flexural properties in accordance with ASTM D 790 and tensile properties in accordance with ASTM D 638. Maintenance and repair of the completed CIPP-lined conduit .\u2014No maintenance is typically required for the CIPP-lined conduit, unless the conduit requires some type of cleaning. Periodic operation of the CIPP-lined conduit usually is sufficient to flush sediments through the system. The CIPP lining is smooth and Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 185.\u2014The ca libration hose of thi s pulled-i n-place CIPP developed \"fins.\" These fins were considered to have an insignificant effect on hydraulic capacity for this particular condui t application and wer e not remo ved. generally resists the adherence of sediment. See section 9.6 for guidance on cleaning of conduits. If the CI PP liner exper iences some type of damage over the long ter m, the damage should be assessed by trained personnel using man-entry or CCTV inspection methods as discussed in s ection 9.5. Repair of the CIPP lining after ins tallation and curing ar e completed is possible. Repair kits are available f rom the manuf acturer. For an example of a project that utilized a CIPP liner s ee the cas e history for Willow Creek in appendix B. 12.3 Spray lining Spray lining is a conduit renovation method that has been used since the 1920s mainly for s mall diameter water mains (USACE, 2001d, p. 10). Spray lining typically involves the s praying of a cement mor tar mixtur e or epoxy r esin agains t the ins ide walls of the existing conduit. Trowels tha t trail the rota ting spra yer hea d smooth the sprayed cement mor tar. Spray lining has been us ed to r etard iron pipe cor rosion and reduce the rate of deterioration of the existing walls of water mains. While this renovation method may have s ome limited applicability for low hazard embankment dams, it is not recommended for significant or high hazard embankment dams. The spray lining technique cannot ensure a long term watertight barrier and has a limited lif e expectancy. 330 Chapter 13 Replacement of Conduits Generally, removal and replacement of an existing conduit through an embankment dam cons ists of excavating the dam down to the exis ting conduit, s tockpiling the material, removing the existing conduit, constructing a new conduit and possibly new entrance and terminal s tructures , installing a filter diaphragm or collar around the downstream portion of the conduit, and replacing the embankment material. A cofferdam may also be required if the reservoir cannot be drained during construction. Removal and replacement of a deteriorating conduit can be time consuming and expensive compared to other renovation methods. Typically, construction costs for removal and replacement may be 5 to 10 times higher than for s liplining or cured-in-place conduit renovation methods. This cost difference depends upon the height of the embankment dam. However, if the embankment dam is small and the downs tream impacts to us ers are acceptable; this method may be mor e advantageous than renovation. Often, removal and replacement is the alternative of choice for low hazard embankment dams , since it generally is less expens ive. This is especially true on older low hazard embankment dams, where they may have been built without adequate engineering. Few des igners will want to try and gues s how the embankment dam was built. The safer and mor e efficient s olution would be to remove and replace the conduit and possibly the entire embankment dam.. The advantages of removal and replacement of an existing conduit through an embankment dam include: Evaluatio n.\u2014The exposed foundation of the conduit can be fully evaluated. Repairs.\u2014Areas along the existing conduit that may have been damaged by internal erosion or backward erosion piping can be repaired. Seepage.\u2014Extens ive seepage contr ol meas ures along the conduit can be installed. 331 Conduits through Embankment Dams Design modifications .\u2014The new conduit can be des igned to pr ovide incr eased discharge capacity to meet cur rent or future oper ational and emer gency r elease require ments. The disadvantages of removal and replacement of an existing conduit through a high embankment dam include: Cofferdam .\u2014Unless the reservoir can be drained, the construction of a cofferdam is generally required. Inflows into the res ervoir will need to be diverted. In some special cases a downstream cofferdam may also be required. Costs.\u2014Construction costs for removal and replacement are generally higher than for other renovation methods. Construction costs rapidly rise as the height of the embankment dam increases. Reservoir op erations.\u2014Construction may impact reservoir operations and add risk to the downs tream community. Seepage paths.\u2014If proper compaction of the embankment closure section is not obtained, potential seepage paths may exist along the junction of the closure section and existing embankment 13.1 Embankment excavation s lopes . An excavation tr ansverse to an exis ting embankment dam center line incr eases the potential for hydraulic fracture of the replacement embankment material from arching. Becaus e hydr aulic f ractur e poses special hazar ds when the r eservoir is subsequently refilled, s pecial care is required for des igns that involve excavation transverse to the existing embankment dam. The excavation should be wide enough to accommodate motorized compaction equipment, and the side slopes should be flat to reduce differential strain. The guidance f or excavation dis cussed in chapter 5 applies equally to cons truction involving removal and replacement of existing conduits. Excavations for conduits in soil foundations should be wide enough to allow for backfill compaction parallel to the conduit us ing heavy rolling compaction equipment. Equipment us ed to compact along the conduit should be free of framing that prevents its load-transferring wheels or drum from wor king agains t the s tructure (USACE, 2004a, p. 6- 6). 332Chapter 13\u2014Replacement of Conduits 13.2 Removal of the exis ting conduit The first step in r emoval and r eplacement of the exis ting conduit is usually to excavate the embankment dam to the inver t of the conduit and r emove it. Removal of the entr ance s tructure (figure 186), ter minal s tructure, or other structures may be required due to age or deterioration, or to ease construction of the replacement structures. Occas ionally, wher e removal of the exis ting conduit is difficult and expens ive, the exis ting conduit may not be removed, but will be abandoned by backfilling the conduit with grout and ins talling a new conduit at a s eparate location. See section 14.3 for guidance on abandonment of conduits. Excavations should be wide enough a t the bottom to ensure a dequate working room for remova l of the existing conduit and r eplacement with the new conduit, and compaction of earthfill materials. A qualified professional engineer or engineering geologist should carefully observe and document the excavation r equired for the r emoval of the exis ting conduit to verify that any damaged embankment or foundation materials have been fully removed and/or treated prior to construction of the new conduit and replacement of embankment materials. For an example of the replacement of a conduit, see the Pablo Dam case history in appendix B. 13.3 Design and cons truction of the conduit For guidance on design and construction of the conduit, see chapters 3 and 4. 13.4 Design and cons truction of the filter For guidance on the des ign and cons truction of the f ilter, see chapter 6. The new filter should be designed to extend upstream into the embankment dam. Frequently, the filter insta lled in this situa tion is la rger tha n that used for first time construction of an embankment dam. The filter should extend to both sides of the new conduit and key into the existing embankment dam. If the existing embankment dam has a chimney f ilter, the f ilter should be des igned to be a par t of that s ystem wher e feasible. 13.5 Design and cons truction of the replacement embankment dam The following s ections discuss aspects of design and cons truction that the des igner should consider for the replacement portion of the embankment dam. 333 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 186.\u2014Excavator removing the i ntake structure for an existing outlet works. 13.5.1 Zoning If the conduit is being replaced in a zoned earthfill embankment dam where a central core is substantially different in properties than the outside embankment shells, backfill for the conduit s hould coincide with the zoning for the embankment dam. Core zone backfill s hould only be us ed around the conduit through the core s ection, with s hell backfill s oils used through thos e sections of the conduit. An exception to this recommendation is wher e rock shell zones include lar ge angular rocks that could impos e point loads on the conduit that exceed its strength. For that condition, cushioning s oil with s mall sand and gr avel s hould encir cle the conduit to pr event this problem. 13.5.2 Compaction cons iderations for backfill us ed in rebuilding the embankment dam The soil removed f rom the embankment dam as the exis ting conduit is excavated is frequently reus ed to backfill the notch in the dam. Designers should carefully evaluate the water content of these soils and deter mine if drying or wetting is required for satisfactor y reuse. The excavated s lopes in the exis ting embankment dam may remain expos ed for a period of time before they are backfilled. The time over which the excavation made to r eplace the conduit is left expos ed may be hot, dry weather . In this case, the expos ed soils on the f ace of the excavation may desiccate to cons iderable depths . Before commencing backfilling of the excavation 334 Chapter 13\u2014Replacement of Conduits in the embankment dam, any des iccation cr acks in the exis ting dam mus t be removed, and the earthfill s urface dis ked and mois tened. This proces s will probably have to be delayed until immediately before backfill of an interval of the embankment dam is ready to commence. If backfilling of the excavation is interrupted during hot weather, the s urface of the recons truction backfill als o should be clos ely ins pected for des iccation features before placing new fill. Poorly bonded lifts can occur during interruptions of fill placement. They provide an avenue for possible internal erosion. Designers should consider these important points: Testing .\u2014Soils used to rebuild the embankment dam should be evaluated by the same tests that would be used to evaluate soils for a new embankment dam. The water content, plasticity, gradation, compaction properties, and dispersivity of clay fines are important evaluations . If the replacement fill is in a zoned embankment dam, similar zoning should be used. Water content .\u2014Soils used to rebuild the embankment dam s hould us ually be placed wet of Standard Proctor optimum water content to improve their flexibility and res istance to cracking and arching. Compacting s oils at water contents that ar e 1 to 3 per cent wet of optimum s ignificantly impr oves their flexibility. At the s ame time, the likelihood that pore pres sures could be generated in medium to high plas ticity clays in fills of significant height s hould also be evaluated. Designers must weigh the advantages of compacting s oils wet of optimum a gainst the disa dvantages of this wetter compa ction wa ter content. The lower shear strength and potential pore pressures generated by wetter compaction water contents must be cons idered in the des ign stability evaluations. Many designers consider excessive pore pressures to be a lesser long term danger to the successful performance of an embankment dam than the danger of arching and hydraulic fracture if the soils are placed dry. Expo sed filler .\u2014Special care to remove des iccation cracks in expos ed fill s urfaces is important. This applies to the exposed excavation slopes and to layers of fill used in reconstructing the embankment dam. For additional guidance on hydr aulic f ractur e and clos ure sections , see section 5.2. 13.6 Cons truction impacts Generally, the construction period for a complete removal and replacement of a conduit will require more time than other renovation methods . Mitigating the impacts of a longer construction period may require consideration of the following: 335 Conduits through Embankment Dams Water requirem ents.\u2014Providing for diversion and downstream water require ments tc.). etc), r clos ures, construction of detours (such a s detouring da m crest tra ffic). Disturbance .\u2014Larger disturbance ar eas and potential envir onmental is sues. Draining or d rawing down of the reservoir .\u2014Caution is re quire d if the reservoir is drained, since the existence of a heavy bed load could move and block the intake s tructure. 13.7 Cons truction of a cofferdam or temporary divers ion channel . A cof ferdam (f igure 187) may be needed to act as a tempor ary bar rier to pr otect the construction area from flooding (Reclamation, 1987a, pp. 499-500). If cons truction for the removal and replacement of the existing conduit can be performed during the low water season, the us e of a cof ferdam may be minimal. However , wher e the reservoir inflow characteristics are such that construction cannot be done during a low water season, the cofferdam must be designed for safety and for optimal height to accommodate the full range of expected inflows during the construction period. Often the flood selected for sizing diversion requirements is based on the projected length of the construction period. For instance, if the projected length of the construction per iod is 1 year , the cof ferdam would need to be able to accommodate a flood with a return interval of 5 years. If the projected length of the construction period is 2 years, a 10-year diversion flood would be used. At some sites, a diversion channel in lieu of a cofferdam may be more practical. Diversions or cofferdams may not be justified for smaller embankment dam projects with limited wor king room f or the r emoval and r eplacement of conduits . For these projects, certain hydrologic events during construction may impede progress and cause delays resulting in added costs for clean up of debris caused by flooding. For this situation, construction should be scheduled during periods when the lowest rainfall is probable to avoid these problems. Figure 188 shows an embankment dam site where rainfall during construction has partially flooded the exposed excavation and conduit removal. This flooding res ulted in a delay and cleanup before construction could resume. 13.8 Design of entrance and terminal s tructures The removal and replacement of an existing conduit may require partial or full removal and replacement of certain s tructures to improve releas e capabilities or to 336Chapter 13\u2014Replacement of Conduits Figure 187.\u2014Coffer dam constr ucted a round the constr uction area for a new o utlet works. facilitate cons truction. For guidance on the des ign and cons truction of entrance and terminal s tructures see section 3.4. 13.9 Microtunneling Microtunneling (als o called \"pipe jacking\" or \"boring and jacking\") is a remotely controlled proces s for ins talling conduits underground without the need for excavation of a trench. Microtunneling techniques should not be used for installation of conduits through embankment dams. Difficulties exist with obtaining a watertight seal along the conduit and potentially with disturbing the embankment dam during installation. Until emerging technology and procedures are significantly improved and shown to be reliable, it is recommended that this renovation method be restricted to installation of conduits in abutments and foundations. Installation of conduits in the abutments and foundations of embankment dams has been successfully performed. The discussion in this section only applies to conduit installation in abutments or foundations. A successful microtunneling project requires detailed site investigation, appropriate consideration of design criteria, preparation of comprehensive bid documents, accurate contractor s ubmittal information, careful execution by a highly s killed operator and cr ew, and a knowledgeable, exper ienced contr actor (USACE, 1995d, p. xviii). 337 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 188.\u2014Dur ing the r emoval of thi s outlet w orks condui t a flood occurred. No stream diversio n or cofferdam was u sed at this site. Microtunneling utilizes a two-s tep proces s. The firs t step is installation of and grouting around a liner pipe, also called a carrier pipe or shield. The second step involves installation of the permanent conduit and grouting of the annular space between the two pipes . Microtunneling has been used to construct conduits up to about 84 inches in diameter . The tunneling technique us es a tunnel bor ing machine with the tunnel lining being jacked into place as the bor ing machine advances . The tunneling procedure is remotely controlled and operated and requires limited entry into the tunnel by construction personnel. Tunnel boring machines use laser guidance contr ol systems. Machines are available to dr ive 300 f eet or more in length in s oft ground. Microtunneling consists of a tunnel boring machine that is equipped with a cutting head slightly larger than the tunnel liner. The cutting head has to be carefully selected to deal with the expected gr ound conditions . Sections of the tunnel liner are assembled outs ide of the tunnel, and as the bor ing machine excavates ahead of the conduit liner , the tunnel liner is jacked into place. The cuttings from the tunneling machine are ground into small particles and removed with a bentonite slurry pumped to a location outs ide of the tunnel. A lubricating fluid is generally pumped into the annular space between the excavation and the tunnel liner to help f acilitate the jacking of the liner . At the high s lurry flow rates and velocities typically us ed in 338 Chapter 13\u2014Replacement of Conduits microtunneling, only a ver y short time is required to er ode s oil at the f ace and caus e large settlements. The operator must vig ilantly control slurry circulation a nd machine tor que to avoid s uch unacceptable events (USACE, 1995d, p. 4- 44). Figure 189 shows a microtunneling installation when an operator stopped advancement. The selection of the micr otunnel liner mater ial is critical. The liner mater ial mus t be strong enough to withsta nd the ja cking forces a nd other a nticipa ted loa ds that the liner could be s ubjected to dur ing the ins tallation and lif e of the liner . The liner should be watertight and able to withstand internal and external water pressures. The liner should also be able to withstand any external earth and grouting pressures exerted on it. Once installed, the liner should be strong and durable enough to provide dependable service for the life of the project. Liner material considerations consist of welded steel pipe, reinforced concrete steel cylinder pipe, plain reinforced concrete pipe, HOBAS pipe (a composite fiberglass pipe) and HDPE pipe. Welded steel pipe is the liner mater ial used on mos t projects . Steel pipe is very suitable f or jacking and generally requires a relatively thin-walled s ection compared to concrete pipe, which r educes the r equired tunnel excavation to ins tall the s teel pipe liner . Welding can be us ed to r epair any damage to the s teel pipe and f or attaching f ittings . The steel pipe has a relatively smooth exterior, which helps reduce the friction between the excavation and the liner as it is being jacked into place. The steel can also be designed to withstand all anticipated internal and external loads. If the tunnel boring bends slightly, the steel liner could buckle as it is forced around the bend. If the liner does buckle, it will be very difficult to repair. Another consideration of the microtunneling technique is the selection of the liner joints . The joints should have adequate compres sive, bending and tens ile strength to withs tand the f orces required to jack the liner into place. Once ins talled, the joints between each s ection of micr otunneled liner need to be able withs tand both inter nal and exter nal water pressures without leakage. The joints need to be per pendicular to the centerline of the pipe, s quare, and s nugly fit, s o the conduit will be s traight and easy to steer with the tunnel bor ing machine. Once ins talled, the joints of the liner are generally exposed to very minor additional stresses. Because the pipe can \"set\" or \"freeze\" in a location if jacking operations are stopped for any length of time, a continuous installation process may be necessary. Common practice dictates the us e of hydr aulic jacks with a capacity gr eater than anticipated in order to avoid this situation. Once the liner is installed, the annular space between the excavation and the tunnel liner is generally grouted in a continuous operation. As the grouting procedure takes place, the lubr icating f luid is forced out of the annular space. The grouting is intended to r educe or eliminate potential s eepage along the tunnel liner . The designer s hould explicitly s pecify the requirements for the liner ins tallation and grouting. In addition, the contractor should be required to submit for approval by 339 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 189.\u2014A very large surface void appeared directly above a test microtunneli ng installation when the oper ator stopped a dvancem ent of the machine and briefly allowed the slurry pum p to conti nue to ci rculate the drilling mud.

Wors ter, et al. (2002, p. 9) s tate: Many of the contractors doing this work may be accustomed to applications where seepa ge along the outsi de of the ca rrier pipe, or between the ca rrier and liner pi pe, is not as significant of a concern. The focus on grouting and pipe placement requirements m ay be unusua l for these contr actors. For this reason, requirements for grouting the ca rrier pipe/em bankment conta ct, placement of the li ner pipe, a nd grouting the li ner pipe/ca rrier pipe annulus should contr actor subm ittal on the m eans and methods to accomplish these i tems should be requi red fo r approva l, to ensure tha t all speci fication requi rements a re met and proper procedures are followed dur ing constr uction. Microtunneling with wet r ecover y of the tunnel bor ing machine is a relatively new and rapidly developing method of ins talling conduits into a res ervoir partially or fully filled with water. For a wet recovery of the tunnel boring machine, a recovery pit is excavated into the r eservoir bottom. The tunnel is advanced f rom the downs tream side of the embankment dam in the direction of the pit. Once the tunnel has advanced to a point near the pit and wher e the advancing f ace of the tunnel is still stable, the tunneling is stopped and the hydraulic lines are disconnected from the tunneling machine. A temporary bulkhead is placed inside of the tunnel downstream of the bor ing machine. The bor ing machine and tunnel liner are then jacked f or the final length of the tunnel, until the boring machine is pushed into the recovery pit. 340 Chapter 13\u2014Replacement of Conduits The tunnel bor ing machine can then be r ecover ed by a bar ge in the r eservoir. An intake structure can also be installed by prefabricating it in the dry, floating it out to the required location, and s inking it into place. If the ups tream end of the pipe will be located below the res ervoir elevation, then a cofferdam will be required. In one cas e, a jacking pit was excavated in one abutment of an embankment dam, from which pipes were extended to upstream and downs tream cof ferdams (Wooten, F ortin, and Walker , 1997, p. 518). A properly designed filter diaphragm or collar should be constructed near the downs tream end of the pipe to inter cept and contr ol potential s eepage along the outside of the conduit. For guidance on the design and construction of the filter, see chapter 6. 13.10 Horizontal directional drilling Horizontal directional drilling (HDD) was developed in the 1970s to ins tall under ground pipelines for the oil and gas indus try without the need f or trench excavation along the entire length of the pipe (USACE, 1998b, p. 1). This method is generally used on pipes smaller than about 12 inches in diameter. Horizontal directional drilling techniques should not be us ed for ins tallation of conduits through embankment dams. Difficulties exist with obtaining a watertight seal along the conduit and potentially with disturbing the embankment dam during installation. Until emerging technology and procedures are significantly improved and shown to be reliable, it is recommended that this renovation method be restricted to installation of conduits in abutments and foundations. Installation of conduits in the abutments and foundations of embankment dams has been successfully performed. The discussion in this section only applies to conduit installation in abutments or foundations. HDD should be restricted to installation of conduits in embankment dam foundations , with the entrance and exit points located at leas t 300 feet from the dam (USACE, 2003a, p. 2). In controlled tests conducted by the USACE, hydraulic fracture of the embankment dam, ground subsidence, heave of the ground surface, and s ignificant collaps es have all occurred with HDD. HDD cons ists of drilling a pilot hole through the s oil with a fluid-powered cutting tool attached to a hollow drill s tem. Drilling fluid under pres sure is pumped through the drill s tem to power the drill tool. The drill can be s teered, both vertically and horizontally, so that HDD installations need not be straight. After the pilot hole is completed, it is often enlar ged with a r eamer . Then, a per manent pipeline is attached to the cutting end of the drill s tem and \"pulled back\" through the hole as the drill 341 Conduits through Embankment Dams stem is retrieved. The most common pipe material is HDPE, although PVC and steel can be us ed. Legitimate concer ns are associated with the f luid pr essures used for excavation during the horizontal directional drilling proces s, and the potential for hydraulic fracturing of the embankment dam. Reasonable limits must be placed on maximum fluid pres sures in the annular s pace of the bore to prevent inadvertent drilling fluid \"returns \" to the ground s urface. However, it is equally important that drilling pressures remain s ufficiently high to maintain borehole s tability, s ince the eas e with which the pipe will be ins erted into the borehole depends upon borehole s tability. The pres sures should be meas ured in the borehole, not at the pump. The in-situ pr essures should be compar ed with theor etical cr iteria that would caus e hydraulic fracturing of the adjacent soils. In a test study by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , it was found that the pres sure in an HDD hole drilled through a levee embankment was nearly independent of the drill rig pump pres sure. Monitoring of piezometer s in the embankment levee s howed that while s ignificant incr eases in por e pressures in the embankment occurred as drilling operations progres sed, the pressures quickly dissipated to their original levels. Studies on plastic behavior showed that fluid pres sure may caus e hydrofracture (figure 190) when the pres sure exceeds twice the value of undr ained cohes ion of the s oil, that is , the unconf ined compres sive strength of the s oil. Therefore, a pres sure of 100 lb/in2 would be expected to caus e hydr ofracture in a clay with an unconf ined compr essive strength less tha n 7.2 t/ft2, a ver y stiff clay. Accor ding to thes e assumptions , for a compacted saturated clay with a s oil unit weight of appr oximately 125 lb/f t3, 8.7 lb/ft2 for each 10 feet of depth would be r equired to caus e hydr ofracture. However , thes e studies did not address the propagation of hydrofracture through the soil but focused solely on the pressures required to initiate hydrofracture. Studies on the elastic behavior compar ed the s tresses on the boundar y of the hole and compar ed thes e stresses with the tens ile strength of the s oil. The coef ficient of later al earth pressure was varied to determine its effect on hydrofracture potential. As the ratio of horizontal soil stress to vertical soil stress approa ched unity, the stresses required to produc e hydrofracture wer e compar able to thos e computed f or the plas tic def ormation analysis. The fact that hydraulic fracture has not been observed in many HDD projects wher e the theor etical cr iteria have been exceeded makes it clear that important factors have been ignored (USACE, 1998b, p. 6). A properly designed filter diaphragm or collar should be constructed near the downs tream end of the pipe to inter cept and contr ol potential s eepage along the outside of the conduit. For guidance on the design and construction of the filter, see chapter 6. 342 Chapter 13\u2014Replacement of Conduits Figure 190.\u2014Hydraulic fracture of embankment levee during HDD installation is visible in this photograph. The drilling mud, whi ch was dyed pi nk, so tha t such fractures could be observed, followed an interface along a clay seam (USACE, 1998b , p. 29). 343 Conduits through Embankment Dams 344 Chapter 14 Repair and A bandonment of Conduit s When water is flowing in an uncontr olled way thr ough the embankment mater ials surrounding a conduit, some designers ha ve attempted to grout these defects to reduce the water flow. This chapter discusses important considerations for grouting around conduits. The chapter also discusses methods use d to re pair damaged condui ts when complete replacement is not necessary. Finally, the factors that are important to consider if a decision is made to leave a conduit in place, but abandon it for use are discussed. Recommendations for filling the abandoned conduit and ways to protect agains t potential pathways for water to flow through the abandoned conduit are discussed. Previous chapters have discussed methods for renovation and for replacement of conduits. This chapter discusses various other methods available for repairing or abandoning damaged and deteriorated conduits. 14.1 Grouting along the exterior of the conduit Grouting around conduits is not recommended as a sole solution for prevention of internal eros ion or backward eros ion piping. Grouting will not likely provide 100-percent encaps ulation of the conduit, and s eepage gr adients in the 'windows ' in the grout may actually be higher than the initial gradients before grouting and should always be combined with a downs tream filter diaphr agm or collar . Grouting can be used to fill or partially fill voids created by internal eros ion or backward eros ion piping, to reduce future settlements, but filter diaphragms or collars or other positive means must be used to prevent internal erosion. Water can penetrate cracks that cannot be grouted closed. Generally, grouting along the exterior of an existing conduit consists of injecting cement or chemical gr outs into voids . Grouting can als o be us ed to s eal leaking joints in the existing conduit. Grouting can be performed from the interior of the existing conduit, if man-entry is possible. If man-entry is not possible, grouting must be performed from the surface of the embankment dam. 345 Conduits through Embankment Dams The advantages of grouting along an existing conduit through an embankment dam include: Impacts.\u2014Construction impacts to downstream users are minimized. Costs.\u2014Construction costs are generally lower (initially) than for other renovation or replacement methods. However, grouting along conduits is not always fully successful and should not be considered a permanent repair. This method does a llow for a dditiona l grouting a ttempts to be ma de in the future. The disadvantages of grouting along a conduit through an embankment dam include: Not permanent .\u2014This method should not be considered a permanent renovation method. This method will have limited effect on corros ion prevention or improvement of structural integr ity of the conduit. Voids.\u2014The filling of all voids surrounding the exis ting conduit cannot be verified. Grouting from the interior of man-entry accessible existing conduits generally provides a higher degree of s uccess in filling voids outs ide the exis ting conduit and sealing joints. Geophysical methods can be used to identify areas of suspected voids. See chapter 10 for guidance on geophys ical methods . These areas can be drilled and a small video camer a inserted to deter mine the extent of the void. Accommodations will need to be made for removal and control of water leaking into the exis ting conduit as the grout injection work is performed. Partial lowering of the reservoir will reduce leakage into the exis ting conduit. While work is going on within the existing conduit, a pumping system to discharge reservoir inflows may be required to keep the r eservoir at the des ired elevation or to meet downs tream requirements . Existing conduits that ar e not acces sible to man- entry gener ally have limited s uccess in filling voids outs ide the conduit and s ealing joints . Drilling is usually accomplished from the surface of the embankment dam. As the height of the embankment dam incr eases, so does the degr ee of difficulty f or injecting gr out at the desired location along the existing conduit. Grout is advanced from the surface through the drill hole to the void us ing pres sure. The des igner is cautioned that this method, unless carefully controlled, has the potential for causing hydraulic fracture within the embankment dam. Drilling from the s urface of the embankment dam is not advisable for situations where the reservoir water surface cannot be lowered. If the reservoir cannot be lowered, grouting along the upstream portion of the conduit is not practicable. See s ection 14.3 for additional guidance on drilling in embankment dams. 346 Chapter 14\u2014Repair and Abandonment of Conduits In the repair of voids along the outside of the conduit at Lake Tansi Dam (Heckel and Sowers , 1995), grout was placed through borings drilled from the top of the embankment dam using only the pressure from gravity (no pump). Holes with large grout \"takes \" should be redrilled and grouted again to ens ure that the voids are filled. The des igner should s trategically s elect the location of any additional holes to maximize the filling of voids . In order to minimize the potential for accidentally filling the conduit with grout, any cracks or open joints in the conduit should be first repaired. For guidance on repair techniques , see section 14.2. Any cracks or other defects should be plugged prior to grouting operations. Unless conditions indicate otherwis e, grout holes should be drilled and grouted in an appropriate pattern beginning at the downstream end of the conduit at the pipe invert progressing up and around the pipe and from the downstream to the upstream end of the conduit. Figure 191 s hows the drilling of a grout hole from the interior of an existing conduit. Grouting should progress so that grout is pushed in the direction of increasing water pressures and up around the conduit to maximize grout penetration and filling of voids, and to minimize the potential for erosion of grout by flowing seepage waters. If suitably safe conditions exist, several rows of grout holes in advance of the Figure 191.\u2014Drilling a grout hole fr om the i nterior of a condui t. 347 Conduits through Embankment Dams grouting operations should be opened to monitor the progress of grouting and observe any connections between gr out holes due to exis ting voids around the conduit. This will as sist in the as sessment of areas where notable eros ion and embankment damage has occurred and the need for secondary and tertiary grout holes. Prior to any grouting or other conduit remediation work, consideration should be given to the installation of appropriate instrumentation in the vicinity of the conduit in order to (1) establish baseline water pressure and seepage gradient conditions prior to repair work, and (2) detect any changes to embankment and foundation water pressures that may result from corrective actions. Depending on the nature of the problem and the corrective actions , such ins trumentation will indicate whether the repairs are successful in lower ing embankment water pressures, or when r epairs may cause undes irable changes that r equire further corrective actions . Grouts used for injection into defects or joints and along conduits are usually cementitious or chemical. Cementitious.\u2014For guidance on cementitious grout, s ee section 14.2.2. Chemical.\u2014For guidance on chemical grout, s ee section 14.2.2. Figure 192 shows grouting operations within a conduit. Chemical grouts have also been used for grouting voids using drill holes from the s urface of the embankment dam. For additional guidance on chemical gr outs, see USACE's Chemical Grouting (1995a). See the Lake Darling case history in appendix B, for an example of grouting of voids existing along a conduit. 14.2 Repair techniques Repairs to conduits are typically performed to prevent further deterioration or prior to more extensive renovation methods. Repairs often are done to stop the inflow of water into the conduit thr ough cr acks or joints . The following s ections mainly pertain to the repair of concrete conduits. For repair guidance for plastic pipe, see sections 12.1.1 and 12.2; for repair guidance on s teel pipe, s ee section 12.1.2. 14.2.1 Concrete repairs Concrete used in modern conduits is very durable and if properly proportioned and placed will provide a very long s ervice life under normal operating conditions (Reclamation, 1997, p. 1). However , many exis ting conduits were cons tructed year s ago using early concrete technology. Neglecting to perform periodic maintenance and 348 Chapter 14\u2014Repair and Abandonment of Conduits Figure 192.\u2014Injecti on of ur ethane grout to stop lea kage. repairs could result in continued deterioration and/or failure. A successful concrete repair depends on quality of workmanship, procedures followed, and materials used. A systematic appr oach to r epair should be f ollowed. Sources, such as the B ureau of Reclamation, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, American Concrete Institute, Portland Cement Association, the International Concrete R epair Institute, and private authors have developed good systems and methodologies. A summary of R eclamation's concr ete repair system is presented her e as an example (s ee Reclamation's Guide to Concrete Repair [1997] for a detailed discussion on concrete repair): Determ ine the ca use(s) of d amage.\u2014The caus e of damage or deterioration (e.g., abrasion, cavitation, poor design and construction, etc.) to the original concrete must be assessed (figure 193), or else the repair of concrete may also become s ubject to the s ame damage or deterioration. A determination must be made as to whether the damage is the result of a one-time or a recurring event. The damage could als o be the res ult of multiple caus es, such as improper des ign, low quality materials , or poor construction technique. Evaluate the extent of the damage .\u2014The extent and severity of the damage and the effects on the serviceability of the exis ting conduit mus t Figure 193 .\u2014Determine the cause of the damage to determine the proper repair method. 349 Conduits through Embankment Dams be unders tood (figure 194). This evaluation will need to determine how quickly the damage is occurring and what the likely progres sion will be. The simples t and most common evaluation technique is by the use of sounding (hammer blows applied to the concrete surface). Experienced personnel using sounding and visual observation can assess indications of the extent of damage. In smaller conduits, CCTV inspection techniques may be required. Sounding can provide an indication of delaminated or disbonded concrete by listening for drummy or hollow sounds. For deeper delaminations or for delaminations with minute separation, placing a hand close to the location of hammer blows or watching sand particles on the surface can provide information. If vibrations are felt or if the sand particles bounce on the surface this can be an indication of delamination. Sounding can indicate concrete strength by the sounds created as the hammer hits the surface or by the rebound of the hammer. High strength concrete has a distinct ring as the hammer hits the surface, and the hammer rebounds sharply. Low strength concrete ha s a dull thud a s the ha mmer hits the surfa ce, and the hammer rebounds only slightly. Concrete cores can be taken from damaged areas to assist with the detection of subsurface deterioration. Laboratory testing and pertrographic analysis are needed to conf irm the caus es of deter ioration. Non des tructive tes ting methods can als o be us ed to as sist with the detection of damage. These include the Schmidt R ebound Hammer, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and acous tic puls e echo devices . The extent of damage determined by the above methods should be mapped and the volume of repair concrete computed for preparation of the repair specifications . In existing conduits that ar e too s mall for man entr y, CCT V should be utilized to evaluate the extent of damage. Evaluate the need for repair .\u2014The need f or immediate r epair should be clos ely evaluated. If the s afe oper ation of the conduit is affected, immediate r epair may be necessary. However, most concrete damage progresses at a slow rate, and early detection and action may be able to slow the rate of deterioration. Early detection may als o mean the dif ference between a r epair and complete replacement. Not all deterioration will require repair if it is non s afety related. Small hair line cr acking on the concr ete surface caus ed by dr ying and s hrinkage usually does not require repair. An important cons ideration in determining the need for repair is the scheduling. Except in emergencies, many conduits cannot be removed from 350 Chapter 14\u2014Repair and Abandonment of Conduits Figure 194.\u2014Evaluate the ex tent of the da mage. service for repair at cer tain times of the year without caus ing significant los ses of water. Select the repair .\u2014Once sufficient information has been obtained, the proper repair method can be determined. Fifteen standard repair materials can be used. If the s tandard repair materials cannot be utilized, cons ideration of nons tandard materials will be required. A detailed dis cussion of s tandard repair materials can be found in R eclamation's Guide to Concrete Repair (1997). Prepare the old concrete for repair.\u2014Preparation of the old concrete is required to obtain a durable repair. Even the best repair materials depend upon proper preparation of the existing concrete. All unsound or deteriorated concrete must be removed bef ore new r epair mater ials are applied. The steps involved in preparation consist of: 1. Sawcut the perimeters .\u2014Sawcut the per imeter of the ar ea of existing concr ete to be repaired using a depth of 1 to 1.5 inches. Deeper sawcuts should be avoided to r educe the r isk of cutting the r einforcement. The sawcuts can be tilted inwar d 2 to 3 degr ees to act as a retaining keyway that lock in the repair to the exis ting s urrounding concr ete. The shape of the ar ea to be sawcut s hould not have any s harp angles , since thes e are difficult to compact the r epair mater ial into. Rounded cor ners are preferable, but require the use of a bush hammer or jackhammer held vertically. 2. Concrete rem oval.\u2014Remove all deteriorated concrete to provide a sound surface for the repair materials to bond. The preferred methods of concrete removal are high pressure hydroblasting or hydrodemolition. 351 Conduits through Embankment Dams These methods leave a high quality concr ete surface in place without leaving any micr ofractures in the r emaining concr ete. Impact concr ete removal methods with jack hammers and bush hammers result in microfractures that will require s ubsequent removal by hydroblas ting. Shallow deterioration (less than \u00bd inch) can be removed with shot blasting or with dry/wet sandblasting. Some environmental precautions are required with dry blasting. 3. Reinforcement preparation.\u2014All scale, rust, corrosion, and bonded concrete must be remove d from the reinforc ement. Methods for re mova l include wire brushing, high water pressure, or sand blasting. In areas where corrosion has reduced the diameter of the r einforcement to les s than 75 percent of the original diameter, the reinforcement will need to be removed and replaced. 4. Maintena nce of p repared area.\u2014The prepared ar ea mus t be maintained in a clean and pr otected manner until the r epair mater ials are placed and cur ed. Seasonal pr ecautions may be needed f or temper ature and mois ture. Apply the repair method.\u2014Each of the 15 standard repair materials has unique application requirements. The methods differ for repair of cracks and repair of damaged areas. Cracks need to be evaluated to determine if they are live (opening and closing) or dead (static). Different resins are applied or injected depending on the objective (structural bond, water leakage sealing). Figure 195 shows an example of a repair being made to a damaged area using epoxy bonded replacement concrete. A detailed discussion of application requirements for the different repair materials can be found in R eclamation's Guide to Concrete Repair (1997). Cure the repair properly.\u2014Prope r curing is require d for a ll standard repair mater ials, with the exception of a few resinous systems. Inadequate or improper curing can r educe the s ervice lif e of the concr ete repair and r esult in significant costs for replacement of the repair. A detailed discussion of curing requirements for repair materials can be found in R eclamation's Guide to Concrete Repair (1997). Limited repairs of concrete underwater are possible. However, these types of repairs are difficult and require special products and repair methods. Only highly qualified and experienced contractors should attempt this type of work (ACI , 1998b). 352 Chapter 14\u2014Repair and Abandonment of Conduits ir being made usi ng epox concrete. The use of epox y resi n ensures a strong , dura ble bond between the old concr ete and the r eplacement concr ete. 14.2.2 Repairs using grouts Joint and defect repair in an existing conduit is an important part of the preparation process for many renovation methods. Leakage from joints or cracks in an existing conduit may s everely hamper grouting of the annular space between a s lipliner and the conduit, and every effort should be made to stop the leakage before grouting (Bendel and Basinger, 2002, p. 6). Two types of grout can be used: Cement grouts.\u2014The traditional \"neat cement\" gr out (cement mixed with water to make a pumpable s lurry) is relatively inexpens ive and can be us ed to fill large and small voids. Some additives are available to adjust the set time and also to reduce the tendency f or \"bleeding\" (which occur s when the cement s ettles out, leaving water-filled voids .) However, cement grouts are not flexible, s o if additional movement occurs, the grouted area may again develop a leak at a later date. Typically, cement grouts may be us ed to inexpens ively fill large voids prior to injection of chemical grouts. The grout mix des ign may r equire adjus tment in the f ield. Plasticizer s may be used to facilitate cementitious grout injection. The amount of plas ticizer may also require field adjustment. Chemical grouts .\u2014These types of grout the polyur ethanes are the mos t 353 Conduits through Embankment Dams common for repair of leaking joints and cracks in conduits . Polyurethane grouts a re genera lly viscous liquids which rea ct with wa ter to form a solid or semisolid material. The properties of common chemical grouts are described in the USAC E's Chemical Grouting (1995a). Chemical grouts are clas sified as hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on how reactive they are when mixed with water. Hydrophilic grouts can incorporate a large amount of water into the cured products, and may shrink substantially if allowed to dry out completely. Therefore, hydrophilic grouts should be us ed in locations which are not kept wet at all times . Hydrophilic grouts cure with lower strengths than epoxy types of grout and are not considered to produce a structural bond in the area being grouted. Hydrophilic grouts form a closed-cell flexible f oam bar rier to stop the s eepage of water through the joint. These grouts are usually injected when the ambient air temper atures in the existing conduit is above 32 \u00b0F. Figure 196 shows an example of resin injection equipment used for small repair projects. For examples of grout cr acks in an exis ting conduit s ee the cas e histories for Pablo and R idgway Dams in appendix B. 14.3 Conduit abandonment When the exis ting conduit deter iorates to a point wher e it can no longer serve its intended design purpose, a decision must be made to renovate, remove/replace, or to abandon it. In some cases, the designer may find it technically and economically more feasible to abandon the conduit by grouting it closed and leaving it in place. For instance, abandonment has some advantages over removing the conduit because a large trench is not r equired to be excavated tr ansverse to the embankment dam. Backfilled excavations in an exis ting embankment are a s ource of differential settlement and potential hydr aulic f ractur e. If abandonment is selected, a f ilter diaphragm or collar should be part of a design to intercept any flow that could potentially occur through defects in the grouted conduit or along the interface between the exis ting conduit and ear thfill. For guidance on the des ign of filter diaphr agms and collar s, see sections 6.4 and 6.5, r espectively. At embankment dams with small reservoirs, abandonment of a conduit may be done in conjunction with the installation of a siphon. See section 11.4.1 for guidance on the design and construction of siphons. For an example of a conduit abandonment, see the case history for St. Louis R ecreation Lake Dam in appendix B. 354 Chapter 14\u2014Repair and Abandonment of Conduits Figure 196.\u2014An example of resi n injection equipment used for sm all repa ir projects. Components a re pum ped independently a nd mixed at the nozzle for injection. The advantages of abandoning an existing conduit through an embankment dam include: Reservoir op eration.\u2014Abandonment can in some cases be done while the reservoir is full. See s ection 14.3.1 for precautions involving drilling from the surface of the embankment dam. Costs.\u2014Costs are generally less than other renovation and replacement methods. The disadvantages of abandoning an existing conduit through an embankment dam include: Grouting.\u2014Difficulties ma y exist trying to grout the existing conduit full. 355 Conduits through Embankment Dams Loss of use .\u2014A replacement means of providing downstream flow requirements reservoir evaluation comparability, and flood dis charge capacity will be require d. The most common way to abandon an existing conduit is by the injection of grout or concrete. Two methods are usually considered for grout injection: From upstream or downstrea m access.\u2014If conduit acces s is available f rom either an upstream or downstream location, this typically provides the simplest method for grout or concrete injection. Removal of a portion of the entrance or terminal s tructures may be r equired to attain s ufficient acces s. Concr ete (with a slump of about 6 or 7 inches) injection is typically more economical, since a larger diameter (about 5 inches ) pump line can be us ed. This type of concr ete is often called \"backfill\" concrete placed with a \"s lick\" line. Injection of grout typically us es a pump line diameter of about 1 to 1\u00bd inches . Also, when us ing concrete, a pump truck can be used. Grout injection normally requires a mixer, which will deliver grout at a s lower capacity and will require more time to fill the existing conduit. Through holes d rilled from the surfa ce of the em bankment dam.\u2014 When the ups tream and downs tream ends of the exis ting conduit ar e inacces sible, it may be possible to fill the conduit with grout or concrete through holes drilled from the surface of the embankment dam (f igure 197). In order to be s uccessful, the precis e location of the exis ting conduit mus t be determined, and the driller must be exper ienced and pr oceed with caution. For an example of this type of conduit abandonment, see the Clair Peake Dam case history in appendix B. While completely filling the exis ting conduit is recommended, the need for completely or partially filling the entire conduit will need to be evaluated bas ed on safety concerns and cos ts. The indicated grouting and backfill procedures in this section may require modification to adapt to given site conditions. The designer is cautioned that grout injection from the surface, unless carefully controlled, has the potential for caus ing hydraulic fracture within the embankment dam. Drilling from the surface of the embankment dam is not advis able for situations wher e the reservoir water surface cannot be lowered. Another possible reason for abandoning an existing conduit would be when a proposed embankment dam raise would result in much higher embankment loads over portions of the conduit. Structural analys is may deter mine that the higher embankment loads would fail the existing conduit and measures to strengthen it are not f easible. To prevent f ailure and to r educe the potential f or inter nal erosion and backward piping erosion of embankment materials, the existing conduit would need to be abandoned and a new conduit constructed. The abandonment of the existing conduit may best be postponed until after the replacement conduit has been 356Chapter 14\u2014Repair and Abandonment of Conduits Figure 197.\u2014Abandonm ent of a condui t by i njection of cem ent grout through holes dri lled from the surfa ce of the em bankment da m to depths of up to 60 feet. constructed and is fully operational. The existing conduit is used for diversion while the new conduit is constructed. Any abandonment activities should als o evaluate the need f or partial or full demolition of the entrance and terminal structures, gate houses, plugging of gate chamber s and s hafts, and r emoval of certain mechanical equipment . Blasting for demolition s hould not be permitted. Shaft s tructures can be backfilled with compacted sand instead of concrete or grout. 14.3.1 Drilling into the exis ting embankment dam Historically, drilling into an exis ting embankment dam has been performed for many reasons. Some of these included the per ceived need to extr act samples for laboratory s ampling or to ins tall ins trumentation. However, as discussed in the following paragraphs , drilling into an embankment dam can caus e serious damage. The need to drill into an embankment dam s hould therefore be carefully cons idered. Many properties of the soils comprising an embankment dam can be reasonably estimated from existing, published data, such as R eclamation's Design of Small Dams (1987a). In other cases, general conditions within the embankment dam, such as the phreatic water level, can be r easonably es timated without the need to ins tall a piezometer. Installing an ins trument within the embankment dam to develop data on a developing failure mode involving internal erosion or backward erosion piping 357 Conduits through Embankment Dams is rarely successful. The installation of an instrument in exactly the proper place would be very fortuitous. If drilling into an embankment dam has been deter mined to be neces sary, drilling through any portion of an embankment dam should be performed with extreme caution. Improper drilling procedures increas e the potential for hydraulic fracture. Drilling fluids , such as water or bentonite, are commonly us ed during drilling to enhance removal of drill cuttings , but thes e fluids should be avoided whenever possible when drilling in the fine grained embankment zones . Drilling fluids are typically pumped to the bottom of the hole through the drill s tem, exiting through the drill bit. For many reas ons, such as a small annulus space around the bit or clogging of the hole by cuttings, the fluids can be quickly pressurized by the pumping action. The drilling equipment can produce pres sures in the hole that can rapidly exceed the s urrounding ear th pressure, caus ing dir ect hydr aulic f ractur e of the embankment mater ial. Hydr aulic f ractur e has been known to occur even when extreme caution was being exer cised and pr essures were being cons tantly monitor ed. Auguring is the preferred method for drilling in the core of embankment dams . Auguring us es no drilling fluid and is inherently benign with res pect to hydraulic fracturing. A hollow-stem auger permits sampling in the embankment dam and allows sampling/tes ting of the foundation through the auger's hollow s tem, which acts as casing. If fluids must be used, the risks must be understood and specific procedur es should be employed to minimize the chance f or hydr aulic f ractur ing. Figure 198 shows an example of an auger being used. With the exception of auguring, any drilling method has the potential to hydraulically fracture an embankment, if care is not taken and attention is not paid to detail. Various agencies have developed s pecific regulations regarding drilling with fluids in dams . For ins tance, Reclamation (1998b, pp. 222-223) indicates that the drilling methods that may be approved for drilling in embankment dams , if auguring is not practical (i.e., cobbly fill) are: Cable tool Direct rotary with mud (bentonite or biodegradable) Direct rotary with water Direct rotary with air-foam Down-hole hammer with reverse circulation 358 Chapter 14\u2014Repair and Abandonment of Conduits Figure 198.\u2014An auger is being used to dri ll within an embankment da m. Selection of any one of the above methods should be based on site-specific conditions , hole utilization, economic cons iderations , and availability of equipment and trained personnel. Once drilling has commenced, drilling pers onnel are res pons ible for controlling and monitoring drill pres sure, drill media circulation los s, and penetration rate to ens ure that the drilling operation minimizes the pos sibility for hydraulic fracture. All aspects of the drilling operation s hould be clos ely monitored, including drill fluid pressures, drill fluid return volume, drill bit pres sures, and occurrence of s urface seeps (breakouts ) of drill fluid. If a s udden los s of drill fluid occurs during embankment drilling within the core, drilling s hould be s topped immediately. Action should be taken to s top the los s of drill fluid. The pers onnel operating the drill and the des igner should car efully evaluate the r eason for the f luid los s. Other agencies , such as the Corps of Engineers , may not allow drilling with any fluids. See USACE's Procedures fo r Drilling in Earth Embankments (1997) and Geotechnical Investigations (2001a). 14.3.2 Inspection A thorough inspection of the existing conduit is required prior to beginning any abandonment activities. Depending on the diameter of the conduit, man-entry or CCTV inspection methods should be used; see section 9.5 for guidance on inspection of conduits. The condition of the existing conduit, existence of any protrusions or obstructions, joint offsets, amount of deflection, and evidence of leakage or internal erosion should be determined. 359 Conduits through Embankment Dams 14.3.3 Preparations The exis ting conduit s urfaces agains t which grout will be placed s hould be free of roots, sediments, mineral deposits, dust, latence, loose or defective concrete, curing compound, coatings, and other foreign materials. See section 9.6 for guidance on cleaning conduits. Any sediments or debris should be removed from the invert of the existing conduit. Any bolts or other projections should be cut off flush and/or ground smooth with the interior surface of the existing conduit. If water is entering the existing conduit and cannot be stopped, an inflatable bladder may be required. The pressure required to inflate the bladder and seal off inflow must be clos ely evaluated to avoid r upturing the conduit. This is usually a concer n when high head is present in the reservoir. Also, some pipe materials, such as corroding CM P, are mor e susceptible to r upture. Abandonment of the exis ting conduit may need to be scheduled to allow grouting operations when the reservoir is at its lowest annual elevation. Siphons or pumps can be used to further reduce reservoir elevations. In some cases, the construction of a cofferdam may be more applicable, if the res ervoir water level needs to remain at a cons tant elevation. If a new conduit is being constructed, grouting of the existing conduit can be delayed until the new conduit can be used for diversion. For accessible existing conduits, any open or leaking joints or holes should be patched to minimize grout leakage. A bulkhead should be installed at the downstrea m end of the existing conduit to resist the loa dings from the grout or concrete. An air return (vent) pipe or a series of pipes should be installed at the crown of the conduit and extend from the upstream end of the conduit to the bulkhead. Grout pipes should be installed at the crown of the conduit. The longest pipes should be attached dir ectly to the cr own and the other pipes as closely to the cr own as possible. Vent pipes can be used as grout pipes after grout return occurs. Grout pipes typically are Schedule 40 PVC, HDPE, or electrical mechanical tubing. Generally, grout pipes less than 100 feet in length can be \u00be inch diameter. Grout pipes longer than 100 feet should be 1\u00bd-inch diameter. The grout and vent pipes installed at the crown should be water tested. Grouting equipment should be capable of continuously pumping grout at any pressure up to 50 lb/in2. Injection pipes for concrete should be about 5 inches in diameter . The abandoning of an inaccessible existing conduit is much more problematic due to the lack of access into the interior of the conduit. Stopping the flow of water into the existing conduit may be difficult, if there is an opening through the conduit. Abandonment may be pos sible by drilling into the conduit from the s urface of the 360 Chapter 14\u2014Repair and Abandonment of Conduits embankment dam at several locations and injecting a thick sand and grout mix (sometimes referred to as compaction grout, limited mobility grout, or LMG) to form a bulkhead (Cadden, Bruce, and Traylor, 2000, p. 8). This technique was successfully used to stop leakage in a deteriorating conduit through a 65-foot high embankment dam in southern Maryland (Traylor and Rehwoldt, 1999). In this case, the approximate location of the conduit was first established by use of several geophysical methods (magnetometer, resistivity, and self-potential). An experienced driller can detect when the drill bit enters the existing conduit, advance it to the middle of the conduit, and then pump the grout to form the bulkhead (Traylor and Rehwoldt, 1999, p. 6). Grout was tremied into the existing conduit through additional holes drilled from the surface of the embankment dam. 14.3.4 Grouting The following paragraphs discuss the grout plan, mix design, and procedure: Grouting plan .\u2014A grouting plan detailing the contractor's grout mix equipment, setup, procedures, sequencing, plan for handling waste, method for communication, and method for sealing and bulkheading upstream and downstream should be submitted for review and approval prior to initiation of grouting operations. Grout and concrete mixes .\u2014Use a grout mix with a water (ASTM C 94) to cement (ASTM C 150) ratio of approximately 0.7:1 to 0.5:1. A grout fluidifier (ASTM C 937) may be needed to promote flowabilty, reduce water requirements, reduce bleeding, reduce segregation, increase strength, and eliminate grout shrinkage during setting of the grout mix. Trial mixes should be mixed at the job site prior to grouting to confirm the expected performance of the mix. For concrete injection, \u00be-inch aggregate should be used. A 28-day compressive strength of 3,000 lb/in 2 is generally acceptable. Procedure .\u2014The pressure at the crown of the conduit as measured at the vent pipe should not exceed 5 lb/in2. Grouting is stopped when the air return pipe in the crown flows full with grout. Cap the grout and air return pipes. Remove the bulkhead upon completion of grouting operations. For grouting or backfilling of long existing conduits, the use of sections is recommended. Long grout or backfill placements could result in sufficient expansion and/or contraction to induce cracking of the existing conduit (concrete). The use of sections is also conducive to ensuring an acceptable seal. Figures 199 and 200 show grouting operations involved with the abandonment of an outlet works conduit. 361 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure 199.\u2014Grout is delivered to the si te and is pumped into the condui t being abandoned.

In theor y, antis eep collar s were des igned to incr ease the seepage length along the conduit and ther eby pr event backwar d erosion piping by lowering the hydraulic gradient along the conduit. Approach channel: The channel ups tream from an entr ance s tructure.

Autogenous growth ( ASCE, 2000) See Spillway, auxiliary . Backfill : Soil or concrete us ed to fill excavations . Backward eros ion piping (piping) : The term \"piping\" has often been used generically in literature to describe various erosional processes, not all of which hold to the classic definition of the term piping. Piping in the classic sense is characterized by t he formation of an open t unnel t hat starts at a downs tream seepage exit point and progresses back upstream toward the reservoir. This classic type of piping is often termed \"backward erosion piping,\" and this term is used in this document. Blowout (also known as heave or blowup) is another term used to describe the condition where hydraulic head loosens a uniform body of cohesionless sand to the point where the permeability of the s and increas es and flow concentrates in that zone that is blown out. Failures by blowout may not be exactly the same as \"backward erosion piping,\" but for the purposes of this document, are grouped under this blanket term. Backward erosion piping involves the following essential conditions: 390 Glossary Backward erosion piping is associated with intergranular seepage through saturated soil zones, not along concentrated flow paths (such as cracks). Backward erosion piping begins at a seepage discharge face where soil particles can es cape becaus e of the lack of a filter or an impr operly des igned f ilter at the exit f ace. As particles are removed, er osion pr ogresses backwar d towar d the source of seepage. The material being piped must be able to support a \"pipe\" or \"roof,\" or must be adjacent to a f eature such as an over lying clay layer or concr ete structure that would provide a roof. For backward erosion piping to progress to the point where a failure occurs, soils susceptible to backward erosion piping must occur along the entire flow path. Backward erosion piping requires a hydraulic gradient high enough to initiate particle movement in soils that are susceptible to this phenomenon. Piping can begin with relatively low gradients for horizontal flow. For flow exiting a depos it vertically, if gradients are very high, the s oil may be loos ened, creating a condition sometimes termed heave. The term blowout is used to describe backward erosion piping that results when a sand horizon is overlain by a clay horizon with a defect in it, and an excessive hydraulic gradient causes backward erosion piping through that defect in the blanket. Defects in the blanket may cons ist of crayfish holes , fence pos t holes, animal burrows, and drying cracks. The transported sand forms a conical deposit on top of the surface clay horizon that itself is resistant to backward erosion piping. In this document, the term \"backward erosion piping\" is used to describe the condition where piping occurs a s defined above. The term \"interna l erosion\" is used to describe all other erosiona l processes where wa ter moves interna lly through the soil zones of em bankment dams and found ations.

There are lesser degr ees of failure, and any 396 Glossary malfunction or abnormality outside the design assumptions and parameters that adversely affect an embankment dam's primary function of impounding water is properly cons idered a f ailure. These lesser degr ees of failure can pr ogressively lead to or heighten the risk of a catastrophic failure. They are, however, normally amenable to cor rective action. Dam safety ( FEMA, 2004) : Dam safety is the a rt and science of ensuring the integr ity and viability of dams , such that they do not pr esent unacceptable r isks to the public, pr operty, and the envir onment.

Disking : Mechanical mixing (deep disking to blend materials) or scarifying (shallow disking to r oughen the s urface). Dispersive : Dispersive clays differ from \"nor mal\" clays becaus e of their electrochemical properties. Dispersive clays usually have a preponderance of sodium cations on the clay particles compared to a preponderance of calcium and magnes ium on \"nor mal\" clays . The imbalance of electr ical char ges that r esult from this makeup caus es dispersive clays to def locculate in the pr esence of water . This deflocculation occur s becaus e the inter particle f orces of repulsion exceed the attractive f orces. The clay par ticles go into s uspension even in s lowly moving or standing water . This means that dis persive clays are extr emely er osive, and f low through cr acks in dis persive clays can quickly er ode the cr acks and lead to r apid enlar gement of the cr acks. Failures caus ed by inter nal erosion in dis persive clay dams are common. Dispersive clays are als o subject to s evere rilling and jugging on expos ed natur al and cons tructed s lopes becaus e they ar e so erosive.

In general, a failure results in the release of large quantities of water, imposing risks on the people or property downstream from the embankment dam. 400 Glossary Failure mode ( FEMA, 2004) : A physically plausible process for an embankment dam failure, res ulting from an exis ting inadequacy or defect related to a natural foundation condition, the dam or appurtenant structure's design, the construction, the materials incorporated, the operation and maintenance, or aging process, which can lead to an uncontrolle d release of the reservoir. Filte r cake: A thin layer of soil par ticles that accumulate at the f ace of a filter when water flowing thr ough a cr ack car ries eroding par ticles to the f ace. The filter cake forms when er oded par ticles embed thems elves into the s urface voids of the f ilter.

Ultras onic puls e-velocity : A nondestructive testing method that measures the speed of an ultr asonic (acous tic) wave gener to tr avel thr ough a structure to a r emotely located s ensor. Unwater : Removal of surface water ; removal of water from within a conduit. 419 Conduits through Embankment Dams Uplift (ASCE, 2000) : The pressure in the upwar d direction agains t the bottom of a structure, such as an embankment dam or conduit. Upstream access : Entry through an entr ance s tructure or inlet por tal of a conduit. Upstream control : Regulation of flow within a conduit located near or at the entrance s tructure or inlet por tal. Utility conduit : A conduit utilized for electricity, gas , telecommunications , water, or sewer service. Valve ( FEMA, 2004) : A device f itted to a pipeline or orifice in which the clos ure member is either rotated or moved trans versely or longitudinally in the waterway s o as to control or stop the flow. Void : A hole or cavity within the foundation or within the embankment materials surrounding a conduit. Water content ( ASTM D 653, 2002) : The ratio of the mass of water contained in the pore s paces of soil or rock material, to the s olid mas s of particles in that material, expressed as a per centage. Water quality : The condition of water as it relates to impurities. Waterstop (A CI, 2000) : A thin sheet of metal, rubber, plastic, or other material inserted a cross a joint to obstruct the seepa ge of wa ter through the joint. Watertight (ASTM C 822, 2002) : Will r estrain the pas sage of water to not exceed a specified limit. Weir ( ASCE, 2000) : A bar rier in a water way, over which water flows, serving to regula te the wa ter level or mea sure flow. Working stress design method (ACI, 2000) : A method of proportioning structures or member s for prescribed wor king loads at stresses well below the ultimate, and assumi ng linear distribution of fl exural stresses. Also known as the alternate des ign met hod. Zone: An area or portion of an embankment dam constructed using similar materials and similar construction and compaction methods throughout. 420 Glossary References American Concrete Ins titute, Cement and Co ncrete Terminology, Committee R eport, 2000.

this appendix is to explain: How antis eep (cutof f) collar s were historically us ed in an attempt to pr event failures from uncontrolled seepage of water along the outside of conduits How research and improved understanding of failure mechanisms caused antiseep collars to be abandoned as a standard design element in embankment dams How filters provide improved protection against failures caused by water flowing along the outside of conduits installed in earthen embankment dams Designers have always been concer ned with s eepage along conduits extending through earthfill or earth and rockfill embankment dams . Many obs erved failures of embankment dams have occur red near conduits , which accentuated this concer n. Until about the mid- 1980s , antis eep collar s and car eful compaction of backf ill around conduits were the traditional methods for attempting to prevent problems caused by water flowing along the outside of conduits. As additional failures occur red, research was instituted to deter mine the bas ic mechanis ms caus ing thes e problems . Once f ailure mechanis ms were under stood mor e completely, f ilters replaced antis eep collar s as the pr eferred des ign tool to contr ol seepage along conduits. A.1 Concrete gravity dam experience Concrete gravity dams were a popular type of water control structure early in the 1900s . Sever al failures of these structures caus ed a r eexamination of design procedures. One approach to preventing failures of these dams from uncontrolled seepage under them was to incr ease the length of the f low path under the s tructures by using cutoff walls at the upstream and downstream edges of the dam. Studies of concr ete gravity dam f ailures showed that s ome foundation s oil types were much more likely to f ail from water flowing under the dams than other s were. Tables were developed that s howed typical values of hydr aulic gr adients that wer e cons idered safe for different soil types. If a preliminary design showed that a hydraulic gradient was exces sive, the s tructure was lengthened, or the dimens ions of the cutof f walls were incr eased to r educe the gr adient at the toe of the dam. A-1 Conduits through Embankment Dams An example of a table f ormerly used in des igning concr ete gravity dams is reproduced in table A-1 from R eclamation's Design of Small Dams , Firs t Edition (1960). The table s hows twelve s oil types and the \"cr itical cr eep r atio\" f or each s oil type. The term creep r atio bas ically r epresents the inver se of the hydr aulic gr adient in a structure design. Early designs without downstream drainage considered a structure to be s afe agains t seepage f orces if the computed cr eep r atio was larger than the va lues listed for the founda tion soil type in the ta ble. If the prelimina ry design was inadequate by this criterion, the length of the s tructure was increased, or the dimens ions of the cutof f walls were lengthened. Later, more reliance was placed on dr ainage and f ilters downs tream of the s tructures. Table A-1 .\u2014Critical creep rat ios for vario us soil types Soil type Critical creep ratio* Very fine sa nd or silt 8.5 Fine sa nd 7.0 Medium sand 6.0 Coarse sand 5.0 Fine gravel 4.0 Medium gravel 3.5 Coarse grave l including cobbles 3.0 Boulders wi th som e cobbles a nd gra vel 2.5 Soft cla y 3.0 Medium clay 2.0 Hard c lay 1.8 Very hard clay or hardpan 1.6 * A structure i s consi dered sa fe only i f the com puted creep ra tio is larger tha n the li sted va lue for the founda tion soil type. Higher creep ra tios result from longer seepa ge distances a nd lower hea d differences. To increase the creep ratio of a design, cutoff w alls were lengthened. A-2 Appendix A\u2014History of Antiseep Collars A.2 Creep ratio tables In the table in the pr evious section, the ter m creep r atio is defined as the weighted seepage path length divided by the differ ence in head between the ups tream pool and the downs tream dis charge elevation. Several important points are illus trated with this listing: Soils with the highes t susceptibility to backward eros ion piping are very fine sands or silts and fine s ands, and s oils with the lowes t susceptibility are boulders with some cobbles and gravel, and clays. Clay soils have a high r esistance to backwar d erosion piping, even when subjected to lar ge hydr aulic gr adients . Although a soil may not be susceptible to backward erosion piping, internal erosion of cracks may pose serious problems for these soils. The table does not address the resistance to internal erosion of various soil types, only the resistance to piping. The resistance to internal erosion primarily depends on the plas ticity of the s oil fines, the dis persivity of clay in the s oil, and whether the soil is very broadly graded. A.3 Antiseep collar des ign in earthen and earth-rock dams Designers of earthen and earth-rock dams adopted the philosophy of increasing the length of the s eepage path us ed for concr ete gravity dams . Concr ete collar s termed antiseep colla rs were constructed a t regula r interva ls along conduits through the dams to increa se the length of the flow pa th of wa ter along the outside of the conduit. The theor y was that f orcing water to take a longer seepage path would dissipate hydraulic forces and reduce the likelihood of piping at the downstream embankment toe. The collars usually extended outward from the conduit by a dimension equal to the diameter of the conduit, or more. Antis eep collar s were often cons tructed us ing the s ame mater ials used for the conduits . Probably the mos t common mater ial was formed concr ete. Steel, corrugated metal, and plastic collars have been used for conduits made of similar mater ials. Collar s were spaced at r egular inter vals along the conduit within the predicted zone of s aturation of the earthfill zone. In the cas e of central core fills with rockfill s hell zones , the collars were us ually ins talled only within the compacted core of the embankment. The Soil Cons ervation Ser vice, now the Natur al Res ources Cons ervation Ser vice, constructed thous ands of small, ear then embankment dams , many of them between A-3 Conduits through Embankment Dams 1950-1970. Most of these sites had concrete conduits that would slowly release the temporarily impounded floodwaters. The design criterion used for most of those emba nkment da ms arbitrarily required tha t the seepa ge path through the sa turated portion of the embankment be increased by 15 percent by adding antiseep collars. This requirement did not vary with the soil type in the embankment dam. Usually, collar s were spaced along the conduit ever y 20 to 25 f eet thr ough the ear th cor e of zoned embankment dams or through the central portion of homogeneous dams. Figure A-1 shows a conduit with antiseep collars with hand compacting of earthfill next to the conduit. Figure A-2 shows a failure of a conduit with antiseep collars constructed around the conduit. A.4 Changes in philos ophy From 1960 to 1980, a number of small embankment dam failures occurred, even though antis eep collar s were carefully ins talled in well cons tructed ear then embankments . Sever al of the f ailures were at s tructures designed by the Natur al Resources Conservation Service. Sherard (1972) reported on a study of those failures. The study s howed that inter granular seepage and as sociated backwar d erosion piping was not the mode of failure for these embankment dams. The failures usually occur red almos t exclus ively when the completed embankments were first subjected to a pool, long before a phreatic surface had time to develop through the compacted earthfill. Other s tudies by Sherard (1973) on larger earthen embankment dams attributed failures and near-failures to internal erosion of clay cores through hydraulic fractures in the embankment zones. The reasons why antis eep collar s were inef fective in pr eventing f ailures near conduits may be summarized as follows: The antis eep collar s only inf luenced water flowing in the immediate vicinity of the conduit. The collar s did not s ignificantly af fect the r emainder of the surrounding earthfill. Most of the failures were found to have occurred not immediately along the conduit, but in compacted fill outs ide the zone of the antiseep collar s. The antis eep collar s were des igned to incr ease head los s in inter granular seepage, but mos t failures occur red long bef ore steady s eepage conditions occur red. Studies showed the f ailures occur red from water flowing along cracks within the earthfill, and not through the s oil immediately next to the conduit. Sherard, Decker , and Ryker (1972) dis cuss the mechanis ms by which f ailures can occur in the f ollowing quote f rom the r eference. In the quote, the ter m piping is A-4 Appendix A\u2014History of Antiseep Collars Figure A-1 .\u2014Hand ta mping embankment material next to an antiseep collar. Figure A-2 .\u2014Inter nal erosion failure along a condui t with antiseep colla rs. A-5 Conduits through Embankment Dams generically used to describe two distinctly different mechanisms of failure, backward erosion piping and internal erosion, as defined in this document. The glossary defines the ter minology us ed in this document to des cribe thes e mechanis ms in mor e detail. As quoted from the reference: One main so urce o f the commonly held idea t hat piping is mo st likely to damage dam structures i n cohesi onless soi l is the ex perience esta blishment of the r atio\", and, later La ne \"w eighted cr eep r atio\" theor y. This theor y was dev eloped fr om studi es of fa ilures of concr ete da ms on soi l founda tions. Under the theo ry, co hesionless si lts and very fi ne sa nds a re the m aterials whi ch requi re the longest seepa ge path to a void piping: a weighted creep ra tio of 8.5 or m ore is needed for da ms underla in by very fi ne sa nd or si lt, wherea s a weighted creep ra tio of 2.0 i s adequate for founda tions of m edium clay. It would a ppear, therefore, tha t the ex perience underlyi ng the creep ra tio theory indicates that piping of a give n leak along a give n seepage path is many times more likely to occur in fine sand t han in cl ay. It is also apparent , however, t hat the condi tions whi ch are needed to ca use pi ping of a leak passing through a soil founda tion directly under a concr ete da m are wholly di fferent tha n those whi ch are most likely to ca use pi ping inside an earth embankment, beca use the concr ete da m provi des a roof for the lea kage cha nnel whi ch cannot colla pse. Hence, the conclusi on that piping failures in homogeneous ea rth (em bankment) da ms may be sta tistically more likely i n embankments of clay than in embankments of cohesionless so ils does not confli ct with the w eighted cr eep r atio theor y. Completely di fferent mechanisms are involved i n the two ca ses. Becaus e seepage was deter mined not to be the caus e of mos t of the obs erved f ailures and becaus e many of the f ailures occur red near conduits with pr operly des igned and installed antis eep collar s, designers recons idered how bes t to pr event s imilar failures. Research by Sherard and others resulted in numerous seminal papers on the effectivenes s of properly des igned f ilters to collect f low thr ough cr acks in embankment dams. Other papers on causative mechanisms of cracks in embankment dams also were author ed. Hydr aulic f ractur e associated with differential movements in compacted fills was the primary mechanis m identified as creating cr acks through which s cour could occur . Based on this history, the major design organizations constructing embankment dams abandoned the us e of antis eep collar s in the mid- 1980s . Seepage collar s were seen to be inef fective in pr eventing many f ailures associated with conduits , and even thought possibly to have contributed to failures. By inducing additional differential settlement and impeding proper compaction around the conduits, cracking of the surrounding earthfill could more eas ily occur. The major des ign agencies adopted an alterna tive design mea sure to intercept wa ter potentia lly pa ssing through the ea rthfill surrounding conduits. The design includes a zone of designed granular filter surrounding the penetrating conduit. This filter zone is termed a filter diaphragm or collar. A-6 Appendix A\u2014History of Antiseep Collars Since this type of design has come into common us age, ver y few failures have occur red. The filter is thought to inter cept water that can f low thr ough cr acks in embankment dams. The filter has a designed gradation that blocks eroding soil particles and prevents subsequent enlargement of the flow path by sealing the avenue for erosion. Philosophically, the filter diaphragm is more of a crack interceptor and s ealer than it is a collector of seepage. If seepage in the embankment dam is a concern, more substantial zones including chimney drains are required. The design and construction of filters is discussed in more detail in the body of the document.

Conduits through Embankment Dams B-viii Appendix B ct name: Anita Dam Location: Montana Summary: Failure of an embankment dam by internal erosion along the outside of the outlet wor ks conduit This case history illus trates an embankment failure likely caus ed by internal eros ion despite the inclus ion of antis eep collar s. Dispersive clays also contr ibuted to the failure. Anita Dam is located about 22 miles north of Chinook, Montana, about 5 miles south of the Canadian border. The drainage, which normally flows only in response to snowmelt or heavy rain, is an unnamed tributary of the East Fork of Battle Creek, which flows southward into the Milk River. Construction of Anita Dam was completed in November 1996. The embankment dam has a height of 36 feet, a crest length of about 1,012 feet, and a crest width of 14 feet. The reservoir impounds 794 acre-feet. The embankment was constructed with an overflow 36-inch diameter s teel outlet conduit as the principal s pillway. Two additional natural s pillways were located on the res ervoir rim to s afely pas s the probable maximum flood. The embankment was constructed as a homogeneous fill with a layer of upstream riprap. After the incident, it was deter mined that the f ill mater ial was a lean clay (CL ) with dis persive pr operties. The spillway conduit for Anita Dam utilized a s eries of concrete antis eep collars surrounding the conduit, but without a continuous cradle. During construction \"flowable\" backfill (es sentially a high s lump s oil cement) was placed under the conduit to pr ovide s upport between the antis eep collar s. Rock-filled gabions were used at the downs tream end of the conduit. During the spring runoff of 1997, unusually heavy snowpack caused the reservoir to fill in the 4 days immediately prior to the failure. On the morning of March 26, a large leak beside the outlet conduit was noticed (figure B-1). Emergency response teams were dispatched to the s ite. Upon arrival, the teams verified the large amount of leakage around the conduit, along with multiple vor texes in the r eservoir water surface about 150 f eet ups tream of the embankment dam. Outflow from the outlet conduit and leakage was estima ted to be a bout 400 ft3/s; this greatly exceeded the capacity of the outlet conduit alone. Around-the-clock s urveillance was instituted. Nineteen families downstream of the embankment dam were notified of the potential for evacuation B-1 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure B-1 .\u2014Outflow of water at downstream end of outlet condui t during failure. Note flow fr om condui t itself a nd from the a rea adjacent to the condui t. and four families chos e to evacuate. During the next day, a local National Guard Unit and T ype II Incident Command T eam wer e dispatched to the s ite. A helicopter was utilized to as sess surrounding conditions , including flow into the res ervoir. The reservoir completely dra ined through the outlet conduit a nd caverns in the earthfill adjacent to the conduit, concluding on March 27, 36 hours after initiation of the incident. Complete embankment dam collapse did not occur. Following drainage of the reservoir, inspections indicated that the embankment material had been completely er oded f rom ar ound the outs ide of the conduit (f igure B-2). The open tunnels immediately adjacent to the outlet conduit extended f rom the ups tream embankment toe completely thr ough the embankment dam to the downs tream toe.

Note presence of a ntiseep nd tampers being used to com pact earthfill adjacent to outlet condui t. The caus e of the f ailure was likely the combination of the dis persive clay embankment material, hydraulic fracture, antiseep collars (figure B-3) around the conduit that required the us e of hand tampers (figure B -4), \"flowable\" backfill for conduit support in lieu of a continuous concrete conduit support, and lack of a filter and drain around the outlet conduit in the downstream portion of the embankment dam. Cold air flowed thr ough the conduit dur ing the winter preceding the f ailure. This caus ed lens es of frozen material in the conduit's backfill. These lens es may have pr ovided a path f or concentr ated leakage when they wer e thawed by the initial flow of water in the conduit during the runoff. Lessons learned Even though antis eep collars were utilized, a major leak occurred along the conduit, causing rapid erosion of the dispersive clays used to construct the embankment dam. B-3 Conduits through Embankment Dams Key changes to the des ign that would likely have pr evented embankment f ailure include: Elimination of the antis eep collars Utilizing a concrete encas ement around the outlet conduit that allowed for better compaction of the earthfill agains t the conduit and to provide ins ulation during cold weather Lime treatment to s tabilize the dis persive soils around the conduit Utilizing a filter diaphragm with drainage provis ions to the downs tream toe Provisions to stop the flow of cold air through the conduit during the winter Provis ions for s low firs t filling of the res ervoir Reference Bureau of Land Management, Anita Reservoir (Bla ine County, Monta na) Dam Failure, Report by Board of Inquiry, August 20, 1997. B-4 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories Proje ct name: Maryland : Forens ic inves tigation of a s pillway conduit failure In March 1993, a newly constructed embankment dam near Annapolis, Maryland, rapidly filled with water during a s torm and failed, caus ing extens ive environmental damage, but no loss of life or damage to downstream roadways. Figure B-5 shows the ups tream s ection of the 54-inch diameter CMP s pillway conduit, having completely collaps ed when the water level r eached the elevation of the weir s on the inlet s tructure. The 25-foot high embankment dam, built in 1992 to manage stormwater runoff from expansion of a nearby shopping mall, collapsed less than 1 year after it was constructed. Based on the original des ign drawings , the s pillway inlet s tructure (ris er) was a reinforced cas t-in-place concr ete box about 15 f eet high and 10 f eet square. The spillway conduit was 54-inch diameter CMP. The overall length of the conduit was about 75 feet, and was to be constructed on a relatively steep slope of about 10 per cent. The first conduit joint was to be made within 2 f eet of the r iser. Four corrugated metal antis eep collar s were to be ins talled on the conduit at dis tances of Figure B-5 .\u2014The upstrea m secti on of the 54-i spi llway condui t com pletely colla psed when the wa ter level rea ched the eleva tion of the w eirs on ucture. Site per sonnel r eported a a ucture shor tly befor e colla pse. B-5 Conduits through Embankment Dams 10, 15, 20, and 25 f eet from the r iser. The conduit joints were to cons ist of 13-inch wide \"hugger bands\" with o-ring gaskets installed in \"re-rolled\" corrugations at the ends of each conduit s ection. A review of a videotape of the site during construction (which was made for training purposes, not for documentation of construction, and only incidentally contained footage of the dam construction) indicated that a substantial portion of the dam embankment had been placed prior to delivery and ins tallation of the s pillway CMP. The spillway conduit was then apparently ins talled into a narrow trench with vertical sides, excavated through the partially completed embankment dam and into the foundation soils. The design engineer was not required to be onsite during construction, and construction inspection was at the discretion of the contractor. Site personnel noted that just before failure, the pool level was at the upper weir elevation, and a vortex (whirlpool) was observed in the pond adjacent to the spillway. Failure occurred at about midday on March 4, 1993. After the failure, about 26 f eet of the ups tream section of the CM P was observed to have completely collapsed. The bottom of the collapsed portion of the conduit exhibited an inverted \"V\" shape. A large amount of upstream portion of the embankment had washed out through the downstream portion of the CMP, which remained partially intact. Deep, ver tical tr oughs were visible on the downs tream slope dir ectly above the s ides of the CM P. The sediment level in the channel below the dam obs cured the bottom half of the CMP. Figure B -6 shows the downs tream s ection of the CMP s pillway remained par tially intact, but deep tr oughs were visible dir ectly above each s ide of the conduit. An unauthorized grating with small openings (i.e., chain link fence), which had been bolted to the downstream end of the conduit by the owner to prevent vandalism, was observed to be nearly plugged over its entire area with debris, indicating that the CMP probably was full of water at the time of the f ailure. The grating was detached from the end of the CM P during the f ailure, and an o- ring joint gas ket was observed entwined in the grating and debris. Grass growing on the dam embankment at the downs tream toe near the s pillway outlet was bent downs tream, indicating that water had flowed along the outside of the conduit during the failure. About 2 weeks after the f ailure, a team of geotechnical engineer s, state and local officials, surveyors, lawyer s, and the local pipe manuf acturer observed excavation of the failed s pillway conduit in order to determine the caus e of failure and who was responsible. Engineers from at least three companies were present, representing the embankment dam owner, the contractor, and the original designer. Two large excavator s carefully removed s oil from above the conduit. The sides of the excavation were s loped as required for s tability. A surveyor documented the Appendix B-6 .\u2014The do wnstrea m secti on of the CMP spi llway remained partially intact, but deep troughs were vi sible di rectly a bove ea ch side of the condui t. location of items of interest (elevation of top of conduit, conduit invert, locations of joints and antis eep collar s, etc.) as directed by the engineer s. The conduit included thr ee joints . When the hugger band at the downs tream joint was removed, one of the o- ring gas kets was observed to have been dis placed into the conduit, and there was debris from the pool under the band. This indicates that water from the pool may have flowed along the outside of the conduit, despite the antiseep collars , and into the joint. Figure B -7 shows the s pillway conduit and portions of the soils that were carefully removed and documented during a forensic inves tigation about 2 weeks after the f ailure. Figure B-8 shows the two lar ge excavators that removed the majority of the embankment dam. Figure B-9 shows the o- ring gas ket that was found to have been dis placed. The forens ic inves tigation confirmed that the CMP was installed in a trench with near vertical sides. In addition, it appeared that the trench may have been overexcavated and backfilled with poorly compacted fill material, which was quickly eroded away by flow along the outside of the conduit and/or into open joints. Loss of soil support would have caused additional conduit deformation, further opening the joints , resulting in an ever -increasing cycle of leakage and los s of earthfill by internal erosion. Figure B-10 shows the presence of undisturbed foundation soils B-7 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure B-7 .\u2014The spi llway condui t and por tions em bankment soi ls were c arefully remo ved an d documented du ring a forensic investigation about 2 weeks a fter the fa ilure.

In addition, debri s from the pool wa s found under the ba nd, indicating tha t water may have flowed unr estricted a long the outsi de of the condui t from the pool a nd into the joi nt. that conf irmed that the conduit was placed in a tr ench with near ly ver tical s ides, making it difficult to obtain good compaction of the fill s oils under and along the CMP and ar ound the antis eep collar s. In addition, it was deter mined that the antis eep collar s were installed in locations substantially downs tream of the des igned location. Seepage along the s ides of the CMP and under the \"haunches \" and the res ulting los s of backfill s oils caus ed the CMP and joints to deform. Figure B-11 shows the result of seepage along the sides of the CMP causing loss of soil support, leading to conduit and joint deformation. Lessons learned A private engineer designed the embankment dam to control stormwater runoff associated with enlargement of a local shopping mall. The original design engineer was not onsite during construction, and the contractor was to provide construction supervision. The contractor constructed the embankment dam for a local government highway agency, who also planned to use the pond for stormwater management for a nearby road improvement project. The contractor s pecialized in utility cons truction, not embankment dam construction. The inspection firm had no control over the B-9 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure B-10 tha t the condui t was placed in a trench w ith nea rly vertical sides, m aking it difficult to obta in good com paction of the fi ll soils under and along the CMP and around the antiseep collars. Figure B-11 .\u2014Seepa ge along the si des of the CMP resulted i n loss of soi l suppor t, causing condui t and joint defor B-10 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories project, and s erved only to document the placement of earthfill and compaction. The local gover nment agency over seeing the pr oject was a highway depar tment, which had little dam construction experience. The embankment dam was completely r emoved, and a new embankment dam and concrete s pillway conduit were cons tructed 2 years later in the s ame location. When the foundation f or the new dam was being pr epared, the State ins pector observed roots and other debris , under the original embankment fill. Since s uch material should have been removed, this reinforces the notion that supervision of embankment dam construction by qualified engineers is essential. After reconstructing the embankment dam, the owner eventually decided not to pursue legal action to determine fault. The original contractor went bankrupt just before the failure occurred, the local government may have incurred s ome liability for overseeing the cons truction, and the des ign was appar ently completed in accor dance with the appr oved s tandar ds in place at the time the des ign was started. (Although more restrictive standards re quiring diffe rent conduit joints ha d been developed before the original embankment dam was constructed, the design approval was apparently \"grandfathered\" under the older standard.) The failure res ulted in new requirements that s pillway conduits not be ins talled into near-vertical tr enches excavated into the f oundation or partially completed embankment dam. This trench installation technique is common procedure for highway culverts , becaus e the s ides of the trench facilitate \"arching\" of the backfill, reducing the load on the culver t. However , this results in ar eas of low s oil pressure along the conduit, facilitating s eepage along the conduit. Filters are now routinely constructed a round the downstrea m portion of the conduit to intercept this type of flow and pr event inter nal erosion. In addition, the us e of large diameter flexible conduits for embankment dam s pillways has been s ubstantially reduced in the las t 10 year s becaus e of this and other failures related to lar ge def ormations , difficulty in obtaining watertight joints , and difficulty placing earthfill under the s ides of the conduits (Va n Aller, 1993).

B-11 ct name: Arkabutla Dam ror leads to def ective joints in an outlet wor ks conduit Arkabutla Dam is an embankment dam located in northwest Mississippi on the Coldwater R iver (figure B-12). The USACE designed the embankment dam for the purpose of flood control. The embankment dam was completed in 1943 and is 83 feet high, 10,000 feet long, and controls a drainage area of approximately 1,000 square miles. Runoff from the drainage ar ea is stored in the lake cr eated by the embankment dam, and the water is releas ed at a controlled rate through a gated intake s tructure located in the lake. Water passing throug h the control struc ture is released to the dow nstream river channel thr ough an egg- shaped r einforced concr ete conduit. The conduit is 325 f eet long, 18.25 f eet high, and 16 f eet wide, and the s ides of the conduit ar e 42 inches thick. At spillway cres t, the embankment dam has a storage capacity of 525,000 acre-feet. Arkabutla Dam is cons tructed acros s a broad alluvial valley. The intake s tructure is located in the r eservoir in the alluvial valley, not in the abutment. The clay top stratum was removed and the intake s tructure, conduit, and s tilling bas in are founded on alluvial sands. Since the conduit is founded on sand, it was imperative that the Figure B-12 .\u2014Ari al view of Arka butla Dam, Mississippi. B-12 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories waterstops in the joints of the conduit be designed and installed properly. Unfortunately, this did not happen. There is no wr itten r ecord why this error was not discovered sooner. A cross section of the outlet works conduit is shown in figure B-13. The des igner s intended that the lower one- third of the conduit be constructed as one continuous monolith. Above the field joint shown in figure B-13, the conduit was designed to be cast in 25-foot long monoliths. At each monolith joint, a rubber waterstop was placed in the top two-thirds of the conduit. The water stop was placed in the center of the conduit walls and extended from 2 f eet below the f ield joint on one s ide of the conduit to 2 f eet below the f ield joint on the other side. No waterstop was installed along the lower one-third of the conduit, but the contractor also constructed the lower one-third of the conduit monolithically. This was not the design intent. With no waterstop along the bottom of the conduit, the ver y fine sand in the f oundation was eroded thr ough each joint and was continually being flushed downstream during operation of the outlet works. Problems with the joints were discovered soon after the project went into operation. Lead wool was used for several years to control the erosion of fine sand into the conduit, but pr oblems were exper ienced in keeping the lead wool in the joints . The designer s estimated that the maximum s ettlement of the conduit would eventually be 0.25 feet. However , by 1950, the conduit had s ettled as much as 0.75 f eet. Much of this unexpected settlement wa s attributed to the loss of sa nd through the joints of the conduit. The first a ttempt to grout the joints wa s underta ken in 1950. Grout \"takes \" wer e not s ignificant in 1950, except at joints 5-6 and 6- 7, wher e 47 and 98 cubic f eet of grout, r espectively, wer e pumped. There are 13 monoliths , with monolith 1-2 being at the upstream transition and monolith 12-13 being at the downstream end of the conduit. Monolith 6-7 is about 60 feet downstream of the centerline of the embankment dam. Monolith 4-5 is about 10 feet downstream of center line of dam. Additional s ettlements since 1950 have been les s than 1 inch; however, in 1970 an attempt to grout the joints again was made due to s and being eroded into the conduit through joints. Water and trace amounts of sand were again noted coming from some joints in 1977, but a ttempts to grout the joints resulted in only insignifica nt amounts of grout \"ta ke.\" Since 1977, a t least three a ttempts ha ve been ma de to stop wa ter coming from the joints using chemica l grout. Grout ta kes were s ignificant only at joints 3-4, 5-6, and 6-7, where 410, 33, and 68 cubic feet of grout, r espectively, wer e placed. Joints 3-4, 5-6, and 6- 7 have caus ed the mos t trouble, but essentially all joints have had to be grouted at least once with either chemical gr out or neat cement gr out. The above background provides an introduction to the problem experienced in the fall of 2003. While in the conduit to replace the filler in the outer dove-tail portion of the joints , joint 6-7 broke los e and s tarted to make s and at a s ignificant rate (2/3 cubic yard in 1 hour). Even though it has been known since construction that there were no waterstops in the lower portion of the conduit, it was thought that the joints B-13 1\" dia. bars, 2'0\" c.c. Field joint 1\" dia. bars, 8\" c.c longitudinally, dia. bars, 8\" c.c. 1'8\" 1'6\" Dams .\u2014Cro ss secti on of the o utlet wo rks co nduit. had been sa tisfactorily sea led with grout a nd tha t periodic grouting with chemica l grout would keep the conduit water tight. However , since joint 6- 7 broke los e suddenly and flowed sand at a significant rate, the conduit could no longer be considered safe for static loading and definitely could not be considered safe for earthquake loadings . Therefore, a team was formed to deter mine what s hould or could be done to ensure the continued safety of the conduit. The team solicited advice from personnel throughout the USACE. The consensus felt that the obvious solution was to line the conduit with a s teel liner . However , the team r ecognized that this would be very expensive and would require bypassing outflow. Also, going through the des ign pr ocess, review pr ocess, and budgeting pr ocess would take several year s. Therefore, the team elected to exper iment with an inter im meas ure that may or may not be the final solution. The team felt that if a plate were bolted across the joint with gasket material beneath it to prevent sand from exiting from the joint, then this would s olve the pr oblem. However , no one had any exper ience in doing this , and ther e was no as surance that the plate would s tay in place. Therefore, the USACE elected to exper iment with two joints during the time that the s tructure was unwater ed for the 5- year formal ins pection. A metal plate was bolted acr oss joints 5-6 and 6-7 during a shutdown of the outlet works (figure B-14). The following gives a brief outline of what was done: Cement mo rtar.\u2014Cement mor tar was used to s mooth the s urface acr oss the joint. This mortar was from 1.8 inches thick to 1 inch thick (had this much differential s ettlement at one joint). Steel plate.\u2014Twenty- two feet of stainles s steel plate was installed along the bottom of the joint. At a dis tance of about 10.5 f eet from the center line of the conduit, a 1.25-inch diameter hole was drilled in the s ide of the conduit to the existing wa terstop (a bout 21 inches). B-14 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories Figure B-14 .\u2014Meta l a cross the joi nt. Waterstop .\u2014A waterstop was formed in this hole using backer rod saturated with chemical grout. Chemical grout .\u2014After chemical grout in the backer rod had hardened, chemical grout was pumped through a tube that had been installed to the bottom of the hole. Grout was pumped under pressure to fill any voids and try to get a good contact with the rubber waterstop. Anchors .\u2014The metal plate was designed to have metal straps hold it down. The metal straps were anchored to the conduit with stainless steel anchors installed 4 inches deep. Anchor straps were installed on 1-foot centers. Therefore, 46 holes had to be drilled at each installation. A two-part epoxy was used to hold the anchors in place. Fabric .\u2014Two layers on engineering fabric were installed at each joint. Compressible rubber .\u2014A 1.25-inch thick layer of compressible rubber was installed about 2 inches from the joint on each side of the joint. Additional steel plates .\u2014A 1/8-inch stainless steel plate 36 inches wide was installed on top of everything. Several holes had been previously drilled in this plate along its centerline to let any water that seeped up along the joint pass B-15 Conduits through Embankment Dams through the filter fabric and out through the holes without building up pressure under the plate. Metal straps .\u2014The metal straps 3/8 inch thick and 3 inches wide were then bolted across the plate, compressing the material and producing a slight bow in the plate. Outer edges .\u2014The outer edges of the plate were then sealed to temporarily hold the cement grout in place. This grout was placed between the steel plate and the engineering fabric. No grout was placed between the two rubber seals, so that any seepage along the joint could pass through the fabric and not build up pressure. This was done to give the plate solid support to help minimize vibrations. After installation, the project released 1,500 ft3/s for 2 weeks and then ins pected the joint. The inspection team found the plate at one of the two repair joints displaced, bent, and torn (figure B -15). As of September 2004, the USACE had yet to deter mine why the patch did not s tay in place and can only s peculate that a log may have hit it. Currently, the USACE is evaluating ins tallation of a steel liner as the only r eliable s olution f or the def ective d metal plate.

B-17 Conduits through Embankment Dams Proje ct name: Balman Reservoir Dam Location: Colorado Summary: Reservoir by pumping and controlled breaching techniques Balman Res ervoir Dam is an earthfill embankment dam located in San Is abel National Forest in south central Colorado near Cotopaxi and is owned by the U.S. Forest Service. The embankment dam has a maximum height of 31 feet with a cr est length of 75 feet and impounds approximately 51 acre-feet of water. The embankment dam was cons tructed at approximately elevation 9,400 feet and is located in a remote area. The embankment dam has a small earthcut, 12-foot wide spillway and no gated outlet works . The embankment dam was built in 1965. On November 4, 1996, a lar ge sinkhole was discovered on the ups tream slope and crest of the embankment dam. The sinkhole was measured to be approximately 8 to 10 feet in diameter and approximately 6 to 8 feet deep. A small whirlpool was observed in the reservoir near the sinkhole, indicating the presence of continual flow into the cavity and apparent sediment transport into the sinkhole. Cracks were developing in the embankment dam crest above the sinkhole (figure B-16) and sloughing of the embankment materials into the sinkhole was observed. Extensive water flow was occur ring all along the downs tream toe of the embankment dam and along the right abutment groin up to approximately mid-height of the dam. Water exiting the s lope was also occur ring on the downs tream face above an 18- inch diameter drainpipe f or the chimney dr ain. After reviewing the original construction plans for the embankment dam and taking into account its past poor operational performance and the worsening condition of the sinkhole and dam, it was appar ent that the dam was exper iencing an inter nal erosion failure, which could eventually result in a sudden and catastrophic breach of the dam and a r elease of the r eservoir. The downs tream hazar d cons ists of a chur ch camp, a hiking trail, a campground, and a county road. Based on this, it was decided that the r eservoir needed to be lower ed to a s afe storage level and to a level wher e no more seepage was exiting on the downs tream face of the dam and along the downs tream toe. Since the embankment dam lacked an outlet wor ks, it was decided to try lower ing the r eservoir by an alter native means . The first a ttempt to lower the reservoir wa ter surfa ce to a safe level wa s made by diverting the reservoir inflow away from the reservoir. The diversion struc ture above R ainbow Lake, located upstream of Balman R eservoir, was adjusted on November 8, 1996 to direct all flows from the drainage basin into R ainbow Lake and away from Balman R eservoir in the hope that this would help lower the water B-18 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories Figure B-16 .\u2014Cra cking at the em bankment da m crest a bove the si nkhole on the upstrea m slope of the em bankment da m. Note the si mple sta king of the a rea to m onitor movement of the cr ack. surface level of Balman Res ervoir. After five days of diver ting the water , the water surface level in B alman Res ervoir was lower ed only appr oximately 1 to 2 inches , and the res ervoir level remained jus t below the s pillway cres t. At this rate, the res ervoir could not be drawn down in a reasonable period of time and be maintained at a safe level. Therefore, it was decided to par tially br each the embankment dam. On November 15, 1996, a portable 3,000 gal/min pump (figure B -17) was delivered to the s ite. The pump was set up adjacent to the s pillway and placed into operation. The pump was oper ated continuous ly for 3 days , and the water surface level of the reservoir was lowered to approximately 8 feet below the s pillway cres t. At this point, the excavation to breach the embankment dam was commenced. A Caterpillar 330 track-mounted excavator was used to per form the excavation. The area of the sinkhole and the ups tream slope wer e first excavated as far into the r eservoir as the excavator could r each, and then the embankment dam cr est was benched down approximately 4 f eet on either side of the br each. The breach was excavated on both sides at a slope of 1.5H:1V down to the water surface level. Rocks of varying sizes were placed in the bottom of the excavation and down the downs tream slope of the embankment dam to help control erosion. Then, a small amount of the embankment dam was removed f rom the br each entr ance, and water was allowed to flow through the breached section. Some minor slope erosion occurred, but no backcutting of the channel into the embankment dam was observed. B-19 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure B-17 .\u2014Portable pump used to initiate drain ing of the reservo ir. The initial f low of water through the br each (f igures B-18 and B -19) was allowed to stabilize and diminis h, and then the proces s was repeated to remove another s mall portion of the embankment dam. The excavation of the embankment material was kept at a minimal amount to limit the quantity of water discharging through the breach s ection. This process was repeated, and each time the water flowing thr ough the breach was allowed to flow out and s tabilize before removing additional embankment material. The partial breaching of the embankment dam was completed over 2 days. The final dimensions of the breach obtained consisted of an 8-foot wide bottom, a 65-foot top width, a depth of 20 feet, and side slopes of 1.5H:1V. The bottom of the br each s ection was provided with r ock riprap er osion protection. The embankment dam was not completely br eached to allow f or a small reservoir with a depth of 8 feet to remain for the purpos e of controlling s ilt depos its in the reservoir a nd to ma intain a fish ha bitat. With the pa rtial brea ching of the embankment dam, the dam was considered to no longer pose a safety hazard to the general public. Lessons learned This event demons trated that with a relatively s mall res ervoir and s mall embankment dam height, the reservoir can be released in a controlled manner by pumping and performing a controlled breach of the embankment dam. Care should be employed when attempting to release the reservoir by means of a controlled breach of the embankment dam.

B-21 Conduits through Embankment Dams Proje ct name: Beltzville Dam Location: Pennsylvania Summary : Conduit cr ack s urvey Beltzville Dam is located in northeas tern Penns ylvania. The embankment dam has a structural height of 170 f eet, a cr est length of 4,560 f eet, and a cr est width of 30 feet. Appurtenant features include a s pillway and an outlet works . The outlet works is used for flood contr ol. The outlet wor ks cons ists of a gated intake s tructure, a 7-foot diameter concrete conduit approximately 1,165 feet in length, and a s tilling basin. The USACE with as sistance from the B eltzville Lake operations personnel performed a condition survey (also called a crack survey) of the outlet works conduit in July 2003. Previous formal s urveys had taken place in 1971, 1988, 1992, and 1999. Although not specifically meeting all of the parameters defining a confined space, the outlet conduit was treated as such for man-entry. Personnel were trained in confined space operations and air monitoring equipment, and a hard-wire communications tool was used dur ing the s urvey. Drawings showing that the r esults of the pr evious surveys were used as a baseline for performing the current mapping. Stationing within the conduit is marked periodically on the conduit walls, although some markings have lessened in intensity. Digital photographs were taken of some of the more prominent features. Spalling had occurred at joints and other localized s pots. Minor cracking, s palling, surface abr asion, and calcitic ef florescence wer erved and mapped. Figures B-20 through B -23 ar e typical of these features. No major leakage was evident; however , minor seepage of water was observed in two locations but with no material being carried. The 2003 surv ey note d changes in the sizes of some of the spalls and seven additional (or not-previously-mapped) spalls. Two new (or not-previously-mapped) occur rences of cracking and thr ee new previous ly-mapped) occur no longer existed in s ix locations wher e it had been pr evious ly mapped. Flow thr ough the conduit during high releases appeared to have removed these materials. In general, the condition of the conduit had changed little f rom the 1999 s urvey. A compar ison of photos taken in 1999 and 2003 also indicated little change in the more prominent features. Drawings showing the f eatures are developed af ter each s urvey is completed using different colors to denote the different surveys in order to follow changes in condition of the conduit.

B-25 Conduits through Embankment Dams Proje ct name: Bohemia Mill Dam Location: Maryland Summary : Undermining and failure of a new s pillway conduit cons tructed on piles The Bohemia Mill Dam is a very old s tructure, cons tructed in the early 1900s with a timber s pillway s tructure s upported on piles . The embankment dam is about 15 feet high with a two-lane county road on the crest. In the 1990s, deterioration of the timber bridge over the s pillway led the county to enact weight res trictions and restrict traffic to a s ingle lane until a new s tructure could be des igned and built. Geotechnical investigations of the embankment dam and foundation revealed that the underlying s oils are very s oft, and a decis ion was made to replace the s pillway with a reinforced cast-in-place box culvert supported on 60-foot long steel piles. Seepage control along the culvert was to be provided by a bentonite slurry wall near the center of the embankment dam and by a f ilter drain at the downs tream end. Cons truction of the new s pillway, s lurry cutoff wall, filters , and new lake drain was completed in 2002 (figures B-24 and B-25). In early 2004, an engineer inspecting the br idge notif ied the owner that he obs erved clear s eepage from under the downs tream end of the s pillway conduit, but there was no indication of internal erosion or backward erosion piping of the embankment or foundation soils. However, within a few months, a sinkhole was noted in the pavement on the embankment dam cr est (figure B-26). The seepage f low had s ignificantly incr eased, and soil particles were observed moving downstream. The condition rapidly worsened, and the s ize of the s inkhole incr eased (figure B-27). Particles of the bentonite s lurry cutof f wall wer e obs erved to be was hing downs tream from an ar ea that appeared to be boiling (figure B -28). Attempts to create a s andbag weir around the boil to r educe leakage under the s pillway conduit wer e uns uccessful, and the lake was drained. Currently, the structure has not been repaired. Repair options under consideration include construction of a jet grout slurry wall along the upstream side of the embankment dam and s pillway or ins tallation of s heetpile cutoff wall along the upstream side of the dam and culvert. B-26 Appendix B \u2014Case soils, num erous 60-foot long pipe piles were installed in winter 2001 to s upport a new reinforced cast-in- place concrete spillway structure.

Reference Maryland Dam Safety Division, dam file No. 158 B-29 Conduits through Embankment Dams Proje ct name: Clair Peak Dam Location: Maryland Summary : Grouting from the embankment dam s urface to fill voids along the outside of a s pillway conduit In April 2003, a police officer traveling on State Highway 235 near Lexington Park, Maryland r eported a lar ge \"pothole\" in the r oadway. A highway r epair crew dispatched to the s ite promptly filled the 12-foot long, 1.5-foot deep hole with asphalt patching material, and the road remained open to traffic (figure B-29). However , one lane of the r oadway was closed a f ew hour s later when it was observed that the patched area had again subsided and a sinkhole was located directly above the s pillway conduit. The lake at Clair Peake Dam had been in exis tence f or many year s before the highway was widened in 1983. As part of the highway modif ication, the or iginal low-level concrete s pillway pipe was abandoned by backfilling with concrete (T he State Dam Sa fety Division wa s una ble to determine why this wa s done). After the 26-foot high embankment dam was widened by placement of new fill on the downs tream s ide, a new 24-inch diameter CMP s pillway was installed under the Figure B-29 .\u2014A sinkhole, which appeared in a heavily traveled roadway above a 20-year old CMP spillway, was filled with asphalt. Part of the roadway was closed when the a sphalt patch subsi ded a few hours la ter. B-30 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories roadway. The new pipe was installed on a s teep s lope completely thr ough the new and old embankment zones, with the upstream end of the pipe set at the normal pool elevation and the downs tream end at the toe of the new earthfill. An inspection of the embankment dam in 1996 noted some \"sinkholes\" in the downstream slope of the embankment near the location of the pipe, but no repairs were made. Another inspection of the embankment dam and pipe exterior the following year noted substantial deposits of sediment in the stream channel just below the downstream end of the pipe. An interior evaluation of the pipe could not be made, becaus e the s ediment depos its at the downs tream end obs cured the pipe, and debr is placed at the ups tream end by a local beaver precluded ins pection at the upstream end. After the r oadway collaps ed in 2003, an ins pection r evealed extens ive deter ioration of the CMP and that substantial loss of embankment material had occurred. Ground penetrating radar (GPR ) detected large voids in the embankment along the pipe, and a decis ion was made to cons truct a new s pillway at a different location (figures B-30 and B -31). The failed CMP s pillway and adjacent voids were filled with a s tiff cement and f lyash-based \"compaction gr out\" (f igure B-32). A specialty contr actor performed the grouting and pumped the grout into the 24-inch diameter CMP using a trailer mounted, diesel powered, piston type concrete pump, specially mounted for grout injection work. The pipe fill mixture was a flowable, nons hrink, moderate strength (500-700 lb/in2) grout with the f ollowing s pecifications : 600 pounds type I Portland cement 500 pounds flyash 500 pounds pea gravel 1800 pounds concrete sand 40 to 45 gallons of water 40 ounces of superplastizer The compaction grouting to fill the voids in the embankment dam was performed from the r oadway and median along the abandoned pipe alignment, with each gr out pipe extending to approximately the pipe invert elevation. The grout-hole layout plan consisted of 128 compaction grout locations based on a 5-foot offset square grid throughout the a nticipa ted trea tment zone. The compa ction grouting wa s performed utilizing a dies el powered track drill to ins tall the grout cas ing through the pavement and fill s oils to the invert elevation of the pipe.

The slump of the gr out was required to be maintained at 2 inches or less. A filter diaphragm s urrounding both the CMP s pillway and the abandoned concrete pipe was constructed near the downstream toe of the embankment dam to intercept and contr ol any s eepage along the outs ide of the conduits .

B-33 Conduits through Embankment Dams Proje ct Montana Summary: Sliplining of an exis ting outlet works conduit us ing a s teel pipe s lipliner Como Dam was cons tructed by s emihydraulic fill method from 1908 to 1910. Como Dam has a crest length of 2,550 f eet and a cr est width of 25 feet. The structural height is 70 feet, and the bas e width is 400 feet. The spillway was constructed in 1923 and is located on the left abutment. The outlet works conduit through the embankment dam was a 6-foot inside diameter, 526-foot long concrete-encased redwood stave pipe. The wood staves in the pipe are 3 inches thick. Approximately half of the downs tream conduit was relined in 1936 with 3/8-inch thick steel plate liner. Figure B-33 shows an aerial view of Como Dam. The reservoir was maintained at a r educed level, becaus e incr eased seepage thr ough the embankment dam dur ing the s ummer of 1992 caus ed concer n over the s afety of the dam. An emer gency s ituation was declar ed, which r equired modif ication to the embankment dam and appurtenances to be completed in the fall of 1992 and winter of 1993 to allow operation of the reservoir in the spring. An original plan included replacing 130 feet of the downstream conduit, since the embankment above the pipe had to be r emoved and r eplaced. However , this was not f easible becaus e of time restrictions. Potential seepage through the concrete in some areas of the pipe and the deteriorated condition of the redwood liner plates led to the plan to line the Figure B-33 .\u2014Aerial view of Como Dam, Montana. B-34 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories entire conduit with a s teel pipe s lipliner . This steel pipe s lipliner would pr ovide additional s tructural s tability and a good flow s urface, prevent s eepage through the concrete, and could be placed in an expeditious manner to allow reservoir operation in the s pring of 1993. The existing redwood liner was removed from the inside of the concrete conduit, upstream and downstream of the gate chamber. A 66-inch diameter steel pipe slipliner (figure B-34) was placed ins ide the exis ting concr ete conduit, ups tream and downs tream of the gate chamber . The steel pipe s lipliner was placed in 20- foot sections . These sections were pulled into place, and the ends were butt s trapped and welded. The voids between the s teel pipe s lipliner and the concr ete conduit wer e then grouted through grout plugs in the steel pipe slipliner. This work (about 300 feet of pipe) was completed in about 1 month. A new transition structure was placed between the conduit and the ter minal s tructure. Also, the exit channel was modified by placing grouted riprap for about 150 feet downstream of the terminal structure.

B-36 Summary: Problems encountered during the cons truction of a new s iphon s pillway Crossgate Dam was cons tructed in 1955 in a rural area outs ide of Raleigh, North Carolina. The site was eventually incorporated into the Raleigh city limits , and development in the area downstream of the 25-foot high embankment dam resulted in a high hazard classification. Very little maintenance was performed on the embankment dam after it was constructed, and 40 years of neglect took its toll on the dam and the CMP s pillway conduits . In 1996, a developer agreed to upgrade the embankment dam in order to build new homes around the res ervoir. A new 12-inch diameter s iphon s pillway was designed to be ins talled in a tr ench excavated thr ough the embankment dam cr est (see figure B-35). Leumas (1998, p. 710) discussed the design of the siphon: The desi gn for the si phon was somewhat unique in that it served no t only as a normal pool regu lating devic e which discharged wat er from the surface of the reservo ir, but also as a \"bottom drain\" could dr ain the r eservoir by di scharging flow from near the bo ttom of the reservo ir. Also, the si phon was desi gned to be self- priming, so that it would not need to be filled initially to start the siphon in order to drain the reservo ir. Unfortunately, a hurricane arrived during construction of the siphon and proved disastrous. The CMPs , which s erved as the only s pillway, had already been abandoned with grout, and the only outflow was by means of a small, temporary siphon installed by the contractor. The flood overtopped the embankment dam, and Figure B-35 .\u2014A well desi gned si phon was to be installed through the d am crest (from Leumas, 1998) . B-37 Conduits through Embankment Dams erosion severely damaged the partially constructed siphon. Temporary repairs were under way a f ew days later , but not yet completed, when another storm caus ed the embankment dam to again be overtopped. Erosion of the embankment dam, at the location of the siphon, by the second storm event caused the embankment dam to breach. A decis ion was made to abandon the s iphon s pillway and ins tead cons truct a concrete riser and barrel structure. However, the siphon was later repaired and was successfully us ed to dr ain the r eservoir (although s everal large pumps were also require d). Lessons learned (after L eumas , 1998) A siphon may be an attractive option for providing an existing embankment dam with a permanent means to drain a reservoir in lieu of excavation of the embankment to install a traditional bottom drain. However, many design elements should be considered in deciding whether to install a siphon, a low level outlet works, or sliplining the existing deteriorated conduit. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. The long term performance of the final selection and public safety considerations, rather than cost, should be the basis for the selected design. Diversion during construction is a vital element to be considered in the design process. An acceptable level of risk for diver sion requirements , which balances economics for the project and an owner's liability, mus t not compromis e the safety of the downstream public. Bad weather can occur during any project. Contingency planning should be made during the design process, which addresses what to do in the event that the capacity of diver sion meas ures is exceeded. Such planning s hould have a readily available notification lis t of State dam s afety program s taff, emergency management officials, and other State and local representatives, who can assist in the event of an emer gency. Reference Leumas, James, To Siphon or Not To Siphon: That is the Question (Among Others)\u2014A Repair History of the C rossgate Dam, 1998 ASDSO Annual Conf erence, L a deter iorated cor rugated metal outlet wor ks conduit Dalewood Shores Dam was constructed in 1960 near Lauderdale, Mississippi without benefit of a qualified professional engineer. The 34-foot high embankment dam has a crest length of 3,800 feet and impounds a surface area of roughly 1,000 acres at normal pool elevation. Normal outflow occurs by way of a concrete chute spillway. Due to downs tream development, the embankment dam is now clas sified as a high hazar d structure. During construction, a 60-inch CMP conduit with an upstream flap gate was installed through the embankment dam as a means to lower the res ervoir level. The flap gate failed the first time it wa s opera ted, a nd the owner a bandoned the outlet works by cover ing the intake and gate with s oil and r ock to pr event los s of the reservoir. Subsequent sloughing of the upstream slope damaged the upstream end of the CMP. An man- entry inspection of the pipe in 1993 noted that the pipe had ruptured, and s eepage into the conduit was observed at two locations. At that time, the s eepage f low was clear , and no soil loss was evident. However , by 1995 the seepage f low had incr eased, and s oil deposits in the pipe indicated that internal erosion or backward erosion piping of embankment material was occurring, and failure of the embankment dam was a distinct pos sibility. Figure B -36 shows the man- entry inspection being performed. Due to the potential for loss of life if the embankment dam wer e to fail, the State dam s afety agency dir ected the owner to hire a professional engineer to develop remedial plans to immediately repair the dam. Figure B-36 .\u2014A man-entry inspection of this 60-inch CMP noted seepage and extensive loss of embankment soil at two locations. B-39 Conduits through Embankment Dams Although all pr evious man- entry inspections had noted that the s eepage into the CMP was clear , the accumulation of soil in the conduit indicated that mater ial was being transported into the conduit. Until remedial repairs could be made, the engineer made f requent man- entry inspections of the conduit in or der to take emer gency action, if dam f ailure was imminent. A decis ion was made to s lipline the existing CMP with a 48-inch outside-diameter HDPE pipe and then grout the annulus between the pipes . The HDP E pipe joints were fusion welded in the f ield. A filter diaphragm was constructed downstream around the downstream end of the existing conduit to contr ol seepage along the outs ide of the conduit. The wor k was completed in 1996 a t a total cost of a bout $140,000. Lessons learned Internal erosion or backward erosion piping of embankment material may occur in an embankment dam, even if seepage appear s clear during inf requent inspections . CMP is a poor choice for use in outlet works conduits through an embankment dam. Sliplining a 60-inch CMP with 48-inch outs ide-diameter HDPE was cost effective.

B-40 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories Proje ct name: Colorado Summary: Reservoir evacuation using controlled breaching techniques Empire Dam is an earthfill embankment dam located in San Is abel National Fores t in central Colorado near Leadville and is privately owned. The embankment dam has a maximum height of approximately 10 feet with a crest length of 100 feet and impounds approximately 80 acre-feet of water above the natural ground surface. The embankment dam was cons tructed at approximately elevation 11,000 feet and is located in a r emote ar ea with limited acces s cons isting of a ver y rough 4- wheel dr ive acces s road. The embankment dam was provided with a s mall earthcut s pillway and a gated outlet works. The outlet works, however, was found to be inoperable. Records showed the embankment dam to be fairly old and was constructed to enlar ge the s torage of a natur al high altitude lake. On June 27, 1997, a backpacker reported that the embankment dam was being overtopped, and a considerable amount of erosion damage was occurring on the downs tream slope of the dam. The backpacker was concer ned that the dam may f ail and indicated that a 2-hour hike is required to reach the site. An investigation of the damsite revealed that the embankment dam had been overtopped, but was not being overtopped at the time of the inspection. On the day of the ins pection, the r eservoir was at a level of appr oximately 2.5 f eet below the dam cr est. A lar ge scarp and er oded ar ea was noted on the downs tream slope and dam crest, where the embankment dam had been overtopped (figure B-37). The scarp was eroded appr oximately 3 f eet into the dam cr est. Appr oximately 0.5 f t3/s of seepage was exiting f rom the bottom of the s carp area, and the dis charge was clear. The flow into the r eservoir was estimated to be appr oximately equal to the seepage through the erosional scarp. The embankment dam did not appear to be in imminent danger of failure, but the erosion of materials through the scarp and the reduced s ection of the embankment dam would eventually lead to a f ailure of the dam. The downstream hazard consisted of one residence located approximately 2 miles downs tream of the embankment dam at an elevation appr oximately 1,500 f eet lower than the dam. A failure of the embankment dam would release approximately 80 acre-feet of water into a very narrow and steep natural channel for approximately 0.5 mile downstream of the dam, at which point the channel grade lessens and the B-41 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure B-37 .\u2014Erosion scarp on dow nstream slope of the em bankment da m at the loca tion of the ov ertoppi ng of the da m crest. channel widens significantly. The dam br eak flood would attenuate r apidly at this point; however, the flood would s till pos e a threat to the one home and anyone fishing and hiking in or along the stream channel. With the long Independence Day weekend appr oaching, it was anticipated that heavy r ecreational us e in the ar ea could be expected, and the embankment dam in its present condition posed a real threat to the safety of the general public. Severa l futile a ttempts were ma de to opera te the outlet works. Since the outlet works was inoperable, it was decided to perform a controlled breach of the embankment dam down to a safe level. After some discussion concerning the relative dif ficulty in getting heavy equipment to the dams ite, and the s ignificant envir onmental damage that would ens ue, it was suggested that it would not take all that much effort to perform a controlled breach using manual labor. Prison inmates had been used previously to perform routine maintenance on embankment dams, such as tree and brush removal. A phone call late in the afternoon to the Buena Vista Correctional Facility found them willing to provide eight young men, equipped with picks and s hovels the f ollowing mor ning. After the inma tes and a guard were tra nsported to nea r the da msite via four-wheel drive vehicles , a plan was devis ed and explained to the inmates . Breach excavation would start at the downstream toe, and slope gently upward to within 1 foot of the upstream slope. The excavated br each would be lined with r ock, which had to be B-42 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories hauled in by hand. The final cut would be made through the embankment dam, allowing the reservoir to be drained in a controlled manner. The bottom and sides of the br each wer e excavated and lined with a gr aded r ock riprap (figure B-38). The excavation was accomplis hed by a f ew well aimed pick s wings, and the embankment dam was breached, and the water began f lowing (f igures B-39 and Figure B-38 .\u2014Excavation of the controlled brea in the em bankment dam. Figure B-39 .\u2014Com pletion of the i nitialization of the br each in the embankment da m. B-43 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure B-40 .\u2014Deepeni ng of i However , the contr ol section, wher e the f low tr ansitions from s ubcritical to supercritical f low, was located in the br each channel, wher e backcutting could occur and caus e a lar ge uncontr olled r elease. The reservoir basin ups tream of the br each would have to be excavated in order to move the control section back into the reservoir. The inmates donned hip-waders and began the arduous task of excavating under water, and af ter an hour 's effort, the contr ol section was safely located s everal feet back into the r eservoir. Empir e Dam was completely br eached by J uly 2, and the reservoir drained in a ver y efficient and cos t-effective manner . Lessons learned This event demons trated that with a relatively s mall res ervoir and s mall embankment dam height, the reservoir can be released in a controlled manner by performing a controlled breach of the embankment dam. The event also demonstrated that heavy equipment is not always needed to per form such a tas k. Care should be employed when attempting to release water from the reservoir by means of a controlled breach of the embankment dam.

B-44 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories Proje ct name: Hernandez Dam Location: California Summary: Conduit constructed over a cutoff trench Hernandez Dam is a 124-foot high embankment dam located in San Benito County, 50 miles southeas t of the town of Hollis ter, on the San B enito River. The embankment dam was built in 1961. Hernandez Dam is a zoned earthfill with ballast berms on both slopes. Slopes are about 3.5H:1V on the upstream side and 3H:1V on the downs tream side. The embankment dam has a large centr al clay cor e with outside slopes of 3/4 H:1V. The upstream shell is composed of a pit run sand and gravel zone. The downs tream s hell zone is clay to s andy clay from the s pillway excavation. An 18-inch thick layer of river run sand and gravel filter was installed to two-thirds of the embankment dam height in the abutments, and a blanket drain was used in the center part of the fill. There is no chimney drain. An idealized cros s section is shown in figure B-41. The outlet conduit of Hernandez Dam is a 48-inch diameter steel pipe encased in reinforced concrete. The pipe is 3/16 inch thick, and the concrete is 12 inches thick. There are six concr ete antis eep collar s along the outlet conduit in the clay cor e section. The discharge is controlled on the upstream end of the outlet conduit by two hydraulically operated 30-inch butterfly valves. There is no downstream valve. The maximum dis charge capacity is 400 f t3/s with the reservoir w ater level at the spillway cres t. The conduit cros ses the cutoff trench in the core s ection of the embankment dam as shown on figure B-41. The antiseep collars are separated from the concr ete encas ement by 3/4-inch as phaltic expans ion filler material. reinforcement in the r einforced concr ete encas ement var ies with the loading conditions. The longitudinal rebar is continuous across the construction joints. The joints have 1 5/8-inch shear keys and 6-inch dumbbell-type rubber waterstops. The outlet condui t was installed on v ariable thicknesses of c ompre ssible material. The first 50 f eet of the outlet conduit at the ups tream toe of the embankment dam is chert bedr ock. From this point to the ups tream edge of the cor e trench, a layer of gravel backfill above chert bedrock s erves as foundation for the outlet conduit. The gravel thicknes s varies from 1 f oot at its upstream end to 3 f eet at the edge of the core trench. In the cor e section, the outlet conduit br idges above 20 f eet of compacted clay backfill, which is in the underlying cutoff trench. Downs tream from the core, the bedrock dips steeply, and the outlet conduit is founded on streambed gravels in the upper zones , grading to gravelly clays in the lower levels above bedrock. The depth of the alluvium to bedrock was 24 feet prior to the embankment dam foundation excavation. The outlet conduit was constructed in the B-45 X Axis Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure B-41 .\u2014Idea lized cro ss secti on of Herna ndez Dam. trench condition under the ups tream shell and the f irst half of the downs tream shell; it was cons tructed in the pos itive pr ojecting condition in the s ections under the cor e and s econd half of the downs tream s hell. The impervious core backfill in the key trench was brought up to \u00bd foot above grade; the earthfill was then excavated down to gra de prior to the insta llation of the outlet conduit. In Februa ry 1997, Sa n Benito C ounty W ater District (District) sta ff attempted to operate the valves to reduce the water release and f ound that the r ight valve was inoperable in the open position. Later inspection revealed that the flexible \u00be-inch hydraulic hose connector to the hydraulic cylinder was severed by the operation of the lef t butter fly valve. The reservoir emptied thr ough the outlet conduit becaus e the open gate was the only contr ol for the conduit. Once the r eservoir was emptied, staff from the California State Division of Safety of Dams, the District, and a consultant hir ed by the Dis trict ins pected the valves and the outlet conduit. Observations of water flowing through the conduit, showed it to have a sag in its profile. This was confirmed in a subsequent survey of the outlet conduit. The outlet conduit was found to have s ettled mor e at locations over the cutof f trench than it had at locations upstream and downstream. The sharp differential in the thickness of compressible materials at that point is depicted in figure B-41. The difference in s ettlement was attributed to the condition wher e the center portion of the outlet conduit was underlain by up to 24 feet of compacted fill in the cutoff trench while the adjacent s ections under the embankment s hells had r ock or gravel foundations that wer e much les s compr essible. In addition to the pr oblems with the sag in the outlet conduit, some welded joints had cracked open and others were in various stages of corrosion. The cracked joints had cor roded thr ough the r uptured B-46 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories coal tar coating and wer e rimmed with calcium depos its. A small amount of water was dripping at thes e joints . The 1961 des ign of the outlet conduit r ecognized the need to camber the pipe, and the initial des ign included a camber of up to 1.3 f eet, water stops across cons truction joints , and planned acces s to the conduit. The steel pipe is acces sible along its entir e length for visual inspection and in case repair is needed. For unknown reasons, a decision was made during construction to reduce the camber from the planned 1.3 feet to what the as-built drawings show as a finally constructed camber of half, about 0.61 foot. This was the camber prior to any fill placement. By the end of construction in early 1962, 0.31 foot of settlement had been measured in the foundation under the pipe at the cutof f trench location, leaving a r emaining camber of about 0.3 foot. Measurements have shown continued settlement of the outlet conduit after completion of construction. In June 1997, 35 years later, the pipe invert at station 6+00 was 0.86 foot below the as-built elevation. This reflects about a 0.3-foot s ag in the conduit at the wor st section. Settlement a long the outlet conduit is not uniform, a nd the la rgest settlement is concentr ated in the s ection that s pans the cutof f trench. Figure B-42 shows the measured settlement a long the conduit. Settlement is lea st under the upstrea m sections of the outlet conduit that has a rock foundation, and highest in the portion of the conduit overlying the cutoff trench backfill, as would be expected. Becaus e the outlet conduit rested on a gravelly clay foundation in the part of the embankment dam downstrea m of the cutoff trench, tha t part of the conduit ha d also settled to some extent, a lthough less tha n that at the cutoff trench loca tion. The sharp differential s ettlement of the outlet conduit at the ups tream end of the trench is attributed as the caus e of the cr acking of the joints in the s teel pipe liner in this area. The concr ete encas ement has cracked as well. Expos ed longitudinal s teel across the cr acks are subject to cor rosion. At the downs tream end of the tr ench, the settlement decr eased gradually becaus e the tr ansition in compr essible mater ials under the outlet conduit was more gradual. No cr acks in the pipe joints were found in this area. In October 1997, the District overhauled the valves, hydraulic operators, hydraulic piping, air vent piping, and hydraulic control equipment at the control house on the embankment dam crest. The valves are now operating satisfactorily. In the same time f rame, the s teel pipe was repaired by welding 3/16-inch thick steel plate butt straps along the 5 mos t badly cr acked joints . The repairs used 3/16-inch fillet accor dance with AWWA Standar d C206- 82. Included in the f ive repaired joints were the two joints cracked by the s ettlement of the line. Heavy cor rosion of the or iginal welds damaged the other three joints . All repaired joints were coated with two coats of coal tar emuls ion. The repairs to the joints are expected to be lasting, excluding other factors, becaus e the r ate of settlement has decr eased. The B-47 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure B-42 .\u2014Settlem ent of the outlet condui t at Hernandez Dam. outlet conduit remains accessible for inspections and maintenance work. Grouting of the cracked joints in the concrete encas ement outs ide the s teel pipe will be considered, if problems persist. If additional problems develop, a recommendation to install a downstream valve on a new and smaller pipe placed inside the conduit, grouting the annulus, and preserving access to the inside of the new pipe have been proposed. Lessons learned This case history illus trated the need to ins tall a outlet conduit on a uniform foundation. Sharp differences in thicknesses of compressible material beneath sections of a conduit that are near one another can lead to differential settlement that can damage rigid conduits. Cutoff trenches that are spanned by a outlet conduit should be designed to be compacted to a degree necessary to achieve similar strain characteris tics in the cutoff trench backfill compared to the foundation materials on either side of the cutoff trench. Another approach to improve this situation is to flatten the s ide slopes of the cutof f trench to r educe dif ferential s train. This case B-48 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories history als o illustrates how important it is to have operating control on gates that are easily operated and maintained. Complicated mechanis ms may be prone to malfunction and exces sive maintenance.

B-49 Conduits through Embankment Dams Proje ct name: Lake Darling Dam Location: North Dakota Summary : Grouting voids existing outside an outlet works conduit Lake Darling Dam is a zoned embankment dam built in 1935 on the Upper Souris River for the purpose of providing water supply for fish and wildlife habitat and production. The embankment dam has a structural height of about 40 feet, a hydraulic height of about 32 feet. The embankment dam holds 112,000 acre-feet of water at the maximum nor mal water surface elevation. The catchment bas in above the embankment dam is over 9,000 square miles. The original outlet works consisted of twin (side-by-side) 10-foot by 14-foot cast-in-place, reinforced concrete conduits placed on alluvial foundation soils in the central embankment area. Two antiseep collars were constructed around the exterior of the conduits at locations that roughly align with the ups tream and downs tream edges of the embankment dam cr est. Figure B-43 shows the outlet wor ks discharge at the downs tream embankment toe. The discharge from the outlet filled a tailwater pool us ed for fis h and wildlife purposes. A small control structure on the downstream end of the tailwater pool provided limited water s urface elevation control capabilities . A cros s section with a profile of the outlet works and design cross section of the embankment dam is shown on figure B -44. Roller gates controlling releas es from the res ervoir are located immediately downs tream of the intake s tructure near the ups tream toe of the Figure B-43 .\u2014 Lake Darling Dam outlet w orks discharge, circa 1990.

The original design and construction did not include any control joints with wa terstops in the conduits. The a lluvia l founda tion ma terials benea th the conduits consist of up to 80 feet of sands, silts, and clays, some of which have moderate compres sibility. The U.S. Fis h and Wildlife Service undertook a comprehens ive safety as sessment of Lake Darling Dam beginning in about 1988. The comprehensive safety assessment included borehole investigations and instrumentation of the embankment and foundation at r epresentative locations , including the ar ea around the exis ting outlet works conduit. During the investigations in the vicinity of the outlet conduit, a large amount of grout being us ed to backfill an ins trumented boring at the downs tream edge of the embankment dam cr est was lost into an inter nal erosion or backwar d erosion feature. The grout los s occur red at the es timated contact between the embankment and foundation materials (see figure B-44) at the top of a bentonite seal installed at the top of the foundation piezometer influence zone. B-51 Conduits through Embankment Dams Becaus e of water demands and minimum f low needs downs tream of the embankment dam, and other concerns, the original investigation program did not include dewater ing and ins pection of the outlet wor ks conduits . Based on the r esults of the obs erved gr out los s, however , it was deter mined that the outlet wor ks conduits must be dewater ed and ins pected to f urther evaluate s eepage and s afety concer ns, including the pos sible caus e of the gr out los s. Following dewater ing, the condition of the conduits was thoroughly assessed in a two-phase program. During the first phase, a nonintrusive investigation was performed using geophysical impulse response to evaluate support conditions, impact echo to evaluate the condition of the concrete, and structural condition surveys (mapping of cracks and locations of seepage dis charging from the cr acks, inspecting the gener al condition of the concrete, and surveying the conduit invert along four upstream-to-downstream profiles). During the second phase, information from the nonintrusive investigation was used to des ign a program of intrus ive inves tigations , including (1) drilling through the concrete to ins pect the condition of the s ubgrade and backfill around the conduits including the pr esence of voids around the conduits , and (2) ins tallation of vibrating wir e piezometer s to meas ure water pressures and es timate s eepage gradients along the bottom and side walls of the conduits at different locations along the conduit profile. Small voids were found beneath the conduit at a number of locations near observed cracks with s eepage dis charge. The lost grout was not f ound. Based on the additional information, final design and construction of corrective actions were initiated. The USACE was going to r emove and r eplace the outlet wor ks within 5 to 10 years as part of a comprehensive flood control project. The design of corrective actions took into consideration the limited planned life expectancy of the outlet. Corrective actions included in the rehabilitation des ign included both primary and secondar y \"lines of defense.\" Primary lines of defense included (1) ins tallation of six relief wells into the foundation s oils to collect and s afely dis charge foundation seepage\u2014thes e wells were installed about 15 f eet downs tream of the r oller gates and discharged up through the floor of the conduit through a flap valve; and (2) sealing of all cracks in the conduit floors and walls with an elas tic filler that would adhere to the concrete and expand and contract during seasonal changes in the width of the crack. The secondar y lines of defense included (3) gr outing ar ound the bas e and exter ior of the outlet conduits to seal exis ting voids and incr ease the ef fectivenes s of the relief well s ystem (s ee figure B-45); and (4) cons truction of a new f loor with a filtered under drain system. While the investigation program found voids around the conduits and unfiltered seepage water discharging through cracks in the conduit floor, instrumentation also showed locations within the embankment and foundation with relatively high water pressures and s eepage gr adients , particular ly near the dis charge end. Corrective actions would not be performed on the basin downstream of the discharge. To address concerns related to potential high discharge gradients in the downstream toe B-52 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories Figure B-45 .\u2014Grouting operations within the conduit. area, a key part of the remediation program would be continued monitoring of instruments installed during the investigation/a ssessme nt pha se of the project. Target \"safe\" gr adients were identif ied. Based on estimated gradients from instrument measurements, the water in the tailwater pool would be incr eased if neces sary to reduce the exit gradients to \"s afe\" levels . Lessons learned The location and extent of internal erosion or backward erosion piping features developing within a embankment dam or dam foundation is difficult to find even when dir ect evidence is available on the approximate location of such features. Conservative judgment is required in the assessment of piping and erosion problems and development of appropriate corrective actions. In many instances, \"multiple lines of defens e\" will be required to adequately resolve the def iciency and pr ovide appropriate risk reduction. Periodic inspection of an outlet works conduit is required to make a complete assessment of its current condition and safety. While inspections can sometimes be dif ficult and expens ive to per form, they ar e the only way to observe certain conditions. Likewise, explorations and instrumentation around the exter ior of a conduit may als o be the only way to detect developing conditions that warrant further investigations or corrective actions and to monitor the ef fect of corrective actions , once completed, on the over all safety of the embankment dam and its foundation.

B-53 Conduits through Embankment Dams Proje ct name: Lawn Lake Dam Location: Colorado Summary: Failure of an embankment dam by a combination of internal erosion and backward erosion piping caused by pressurized leakage from the outlet works conduit Lawn L ake Dam was located on the Roar ing F ork River in Rocky M ountain National Park approximately 10 miles upstream from Estes Park, Colorado. The embankment dam was constructed in 1903 by the Farmers Irrigation Ditch and Reservoir Company to impound additional water in an existing natural mountain lake f or the pur pose of irrigation s torage. The original L awn L ake was created by a natural glacial mora ine and had a reservoir surfa ce area of approxima tely 16.4 a cres. An earthen dam was constructed with a maximum height of approximately 26 feet, which cr eated a r eservoir with a s urface ar ea of appr oximately 47.1 acr es and a storage volume of 817 acre-feet. The reservoir was at an elevation of approximately 11,000 f eet. The outlet wor ks for the embankment dam cons isted of a 36- inch diameter steel pipe with a gate valve to contr ol releases from the r eservoir situated at approximately the center of the embankment dam. At approximately 5:30 in the morning of July 15, 1982, Lawn Lake Dam failed. Estimates indicate that the br each of the embankment dam r eleased 674 acr e-feet of water, and the resulting dambreak flood had an estimated peak discharge of 18,000 ft3/s (USGS, 1982). The final breach dimensions through the embankment dam wer e surveyed to have a maximum depth of 28 feet, a top width of 97 feet, and a bottom width of 55 feet. The embankment dam mater ials expos ed at the f ace of the breach showed the dam to have been constructed mainly of a silty and poorly graded sand with varying amounts of fine gravels and considerable amounts of organic materials. Figures B-46, B-47, and B-48 show the breached embankment dam. The embankment dam was not obs erved as it was failing. The embankment dam f ailure occur red when a lar ge leak developed in a pr essurized outlet conduit. Flow from the leak quickly er oded the s urrounding low plas ticity embankment s oils. The probable caus e of the def ect in the outlet conduit s ystem that led to the embankment dam failure was deterioration of the lead caulking at the joint between the s teel outlet conduit and the gate valve us ed to contr ol releases through the conduit. The opening at this juncture in the conduit allowed pressurized water to es cape the conduit, becaus e the gate valve was closed, and the r eservoir was full.

B-55 Conduits through Embankment Dams The embankment dam was cons tructed of low plas ticity s oils susceptible to backward erosion piping, and the failure could have occurred from this mechanism. The high s eepage pr essures caus ed by the conduit leak would have been s ufficient to initiate backwar d erosion piping, and the exit f ace for the s eepage was not pr otected by an adequate filter. Another pos sibility is that the pres surized leakage hydraulically fractured the earthfill s urrounding the conduit and the failure occurred from the mechanis m of inter nal erosion. Probably, a combination of these mechanis ms was respons ible for the earthfill eros ion. Regardles s of the mechanis m, the failure demonstrated the dangers of a pressurized conduit that develops a defect allowing full reservoir head to be imposed on soil that is not protected by filters. The embankment dam f ailure resulted in the los s of three lives and appr oximately $35 million in property damage in the town of Es tes Park. The resulting dam break flood also overtopped and failed the Cascade Lake Dam located 6.7 miles downstream of Lawn Lake Dam. Cascade Lake Dam was a 12-foot high concrete gravity dam with a r eservoir with a s torage volume of 12.1 acr e-feet. The concr ete dam was overtopped by an estimated 4.2 feet. Extensive erosional damage also occurred along the Roaring and Fall Rivers downstream of Lawn Lake Dam. The river channels were widened by several tens of feet in some locations, and scour depths varied from 5 to 50 feet. A large alluvial fan was also created at the confluence of the Roar ing and F all River s. The alluvial f an cover ed an ar ea of approximately 42 acres and had an estimated maximum thickness of 44 feet. The fan also dammed the F all River , creating a r eservoir with a s urface ar ea of 17 acr es. The largest boulder believed to have been moved by the f loodwater s was estimated to have a weight of 450 tons. Lesson learned If possible, construction of fully pressurized conduits beneath embankment dams should be avoided. When pressurized conduits are constructed within embankment dams, the joints in the conduit should be properly designed to assure watertightness under all loading conditions .

Little Chippewa Cr eek Dam, known of ficially as \"Chippewa Cons ervancy Dis trict Structure VIIc\" is a high- hazard dam located about 3 miles northwes t of the city of Orrville, Ohio. The 27-foot high embankment dam is a single-purpos e, dry flood contr ol structure des igned in 1971 by the Soil Cons ervation Ser vice under the authority of Public Law PL-566. The embankment dam was designed with an upstream slope of 3H:1V and a downs tream s lope of 2.5H:1V. The site lies on the glaciated, moderately rolling Allegheny P lateau. The site was glaciated dur ing a s eries of advances and r etreats during the Wisconsin Stage of the Pleistocene Epoch. The foundation soils consist of glacial outwash deposits of layered sand, silt and clay. Cons truction of the embankment dam s tarted in July 1972. During s pillway construction, the ins pector noted the pr esence of soft, gray silt at the bottom of the excavation for the pipe. The foundation was overexcavated by 1 foot and backfilled with AASHTO No. 46 coarse aggregate. The pipe was installed on top of the aggregate and bedded in concr ete. After the pipe joints were cover ed with 12- inch wide s heet metal s hields, embankment material was backfilled around the pipe. Cons truction was suspended in late 1972 due to winter weather . Cons truction of the embankment dam res umed in July 1973. Earthfill placement proceeded r apidly without incident until mid- Augus t 1973. As the embankment dam was nearing completion, the downstream portion failed suddenly, severely damaging the spillway conduit. The downs tream end of the conduit moved about 2.4 feet in the downs tream dir ection. A 1.5- foot high bulge was observed in the s tream bottom, and s ome cr acks were obs erved in the s lope below the dam. However , no settlement, cracking, or other distress of the embankment dam itself were observed. The bottom of the pipe under the maximum earthfill height s ettled by about 1.5 feet, and the joints of one section of the pipe separated by more than 1 foot (figure B-49). The engineers inves tigating of the failure reported that the foundation s oils under the B-57 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure B-49 .\u2014The pi pe joi nts sepa rated movement occur red dur ing constr uction of the em bankment da m. pipe, visible through the open joints, were soft, wet silts that resembled \"stiff grease.\" The engineer reported that no s ands or gravels were encounter ed, and that the soil could be probed easily with a hand ruler to depths of 6 feet below the pipe. The report a lso indica ted tha t the sheet meta l shields on the outside of the joints appeared to support the embankment soils and minimized migration of soil into the open joints. Becaus e the near ly completed s tructure was capable of impounding water , but was unsafe, tempor ary modif ications were required to pr event its failure during a s torm. A 30- foot wide bypas s channel was immediately excavated thr ough the emer gency spillway. Also, a 30-inch diameter CMP was temporarily ins talled ins ide of the failed concrete pipe to carry stream flow and to prevent flow of water over the open joints. The per manent r epairs included r emoval and r elocation of the f pr incipal spillway conduit and appurtenances ; recons truction of the embankment dam in the vicinity of the failed s pillway; ins tallation of a new s pillway at another location; addition of 70-foot-wide s tabilizing berms to the ups tream and downs tream s ides of the dam; addition of chimney drain across the reconstructed area of the embankment dam and around the new s pillway pipe; and addition of a cut-off trench acros s the emergency s pillway control s ection to s eal the emergency breach channel. Reconstruction of the embankment dam was successfully completed in late 1974. B-58 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories Lessons learned Embankment dams constructed on soft clay foundations may experience excessive settlement and s preading, and conduits associated with them may be damaged. Design of embankment dams on soft foundations must consider the undrained strength likely to be operative during construction and incorporate design measures, such as wide berms and special conduit joint details to address these problems. Reference Ohio DNR and Phase 1 Insp ection R eport, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , 1981, which includes the 1973 \"Repor t of Investigation of Structural Def iciency\" as an B-59 Conduits name: Loveton Farms Dam Location: Maryland Summary: Failure of an embankment dam by internal eros ion along the s pillway conduit Loveton Farms Dam is a 23-foot high earth embankment dam in Baltimore County, Maryland. The dam was constructed in 1985 as a stormwater management structure to attenuate increased runoff due to commercial and residential development of the watershed. The embankment dam is a \"dry structure\" which does not normally impound any water. The spillway cons ists of large diameter (78-inch diameter) CMP constructed through the embankment dam. A vertical section of CMP about 16 feet high (ris er) was cons tructed at the ups tream end of the s pillway pipe. Low flows pass through a small (1-foot) opening at the base of the riser. Flows in excess of the 100-year s torm bypas s the embankment dam via an emergency s pillway channel excavated in the lef t abutment. The embankment dam is essentially a homogeneous embankment constructed of local r esidual s oils. These soils are micaceous silty fine sands and s andy s ilts weather ed from the par ent rock (P iedmont Geologic P rovince). They are clas sified as SM and ML under the Unified Soil Clas sification Sys tem. Typical liquid limits are about 30 percent, with a plasticity index of about 7. The embankment dam f ailed les s than a year after it was completed, when a r elatively small storm filled the pool to the top of the ris er. Failure was attributed to internal erosion of embankment fill along the outs ide of the pipe (figures B-50 and 51). The original s pillway pipe was likely placed in a vertically s ided trench excavated through the nearly completed embankment dam. This construction technique is not recommended, as it makes compaction of the soil under the sides of pipe very diffic ult. Poorly compacted fill in this area res ults in poor s upport of the pipe, which caus es exces sive def ormation of the pipe and may caus e the joints to separate. In addition, the sides of the trench may tend to s upport the fill, allowing it to \"bridge\" acros s the excavation, preventing the fill from cons olidating under its own weight. This can create ar eas of low s oil dens ity under the pipe wher e seepage can occur . In addition, differential s ettlement and hydraulic fracture can res ult. The embankment dam was redesigned to include s eepage contr ols. The structure was rebuilt in 1990 us ing es sentially the s ame embankment dam and s pillway B-60 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories Figure B-50 .\u2014Loveton Fa rms Dam failure a s viewed from upstrea m.

B-61 Conduits through Embankment Dams configuration as the original (although a second riser was added at the upstream end of the s pillway). However, a chimney filter was installed which ran axially along the embankment dam. A sand filter diaphragm was also constructed around the downstream portion of the pipe to control seepage and prevent internal erosion of embankment material along the sides of the conduit. The side slopes of the excavation thr ough the r emaining embankment dam wer e des igned and cons tructed as 3H:1V to minimize problems with bridging of the fill. Compaction of the embankment material was carefully monitored and tested during the repairs. Powdered bentonite was added to the backfill under the pipe, becaus e the bentonite would pres umably s well to eliminate any voids . In the years that followed the repair of the embankment dam, Maryland began to exper ience pr oblems with other dams cons tructed with lar ge diameter CMP spillways . In particular , it was noted that many of the joints between s ections of the pipe wer e not water tight. This deficiency is primarily the r esult of deflection of the pipe, (the design standard allowed 5 percent of the pipe diameter), but poor construction techniques and manufacturing tolerances also contributed to the problem (figure B-52). Embankment dam owners were advised to carefully monitor their s pillway conduits . Accor dingly, the owner of Loveton F arms Dam (a local gover nment agency) scheduled ins pections of the s tructure twice per year to document the condition of Figure B-52 .\u2014The fa iled em bankment da m was repa ired wi th a new 78-i n diameter CMP spi llway. However, soon a fter reconstr uction, thi s failed joint was discovered a t the upstrea m end of the pi pe nea r the ri ser. A large vo id was al so observed in t he adjacent embankment fill. Note the o-ring gasket ha s been di splaced from the joi nt. B-62 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories pipe. During an ins pection in 1994, lar ge voids (3 feet diameter and 20 f eet long) were noted in the embankment around the upstream end of the pipe, and the first joint downs tream of the ris er had s uddenly s eparated by about 0.1 m. The embankment dam was determined to be unsafe, and the riser portion of the spillway was removed to minimize impounding of water until a more detailed inspection could be conducted. A more thorough investigation of the embankment dam utilizing s eismic tomography revealed that nearly all of the embankment fill around the conduit was of low dens ity. Since the s oils are frost susceptible (s ilty sands and sandy silts of low plasticity), it is quite possible that freezing damaged the soils adjacent to the conduit. The melting of ice lens es that may have f ormed in the backfill would leave voids through which internal eros ion could occur. Also, the formation of ice lens es can cr eate f orces large enough to def orm the thin s teel pipe, causing the joints between pipe s ections to open. The embankment dam was deemed to be unsafe and is scheduled to be removed. Lessons learned Use of large diameter CMP conduits in embankment dams should be avoided. Vertical tr enches transverse to the embankment dam ar e never permissible, unles s they are in rock and backfilled with concrete. Sloping the s ides of excavations to no steeper than 2H:1V is always recommended.

B-63 Conduits through Embankment Dams Proje ct name: McDonald Dam Location: Montana Summary: Steel lining of an exis ting outlet wor ks conduit McDonald Dam is located near Polson, Montana on the Flathead Indian Reservation. A section of the 6-foot diameter elliptical conduit (figure B -53) was removed and replaced. Installation of both 52- and 16-inch diameter bypass pipes was completed in the conduit r eplacement s ection, and a hydr ostatic tes t of the 16\u00ad inch diameter bypass pipe was performed. The hydrostatic testing was performed in increments and eventually tes ted the entir e lengths of the 52- and 16- inch pipes , as well as existing pipe ins talled in an earlier contract. Due to the exis ting 2-inch diameter air vent at the intake s tructure (tower ), a por tion of the pipe was pressure tested at 20 lb/in2 instead of the 30 lb/in2 required by the s pecifications . An independent testing company performed dye-penetrant tests on the welds of all installed 52-inch diameter pipe s ections (from s ta. 5+79 to s ta. 6+60.12). The annular space around the pipes was grouted. Prior to beginning grouting, the 52-inch diameter pipe was anchored to the existing conduit to prevent the pipe from floating during the grouting operation. Anchorage was accomplished with \u00be- by 7-inch diameter mechanical anchor s placed thr ough the s teel liner and s ecured \u2014Case Histories invert of the existing conduit. A total of 11 anchors were used from stations 6+60 to 8+10. The annular space was grouted in two s tages. The first stage was to a level just below the lower grout connections . The second s tage\u2014the r emaining annular space\u2014was grouted 24 hours later. Grouting pressure was limited to 5 lb/in2. Air vents had been previously installed through the steel bulkheads at stations 6+02, 6+60, and 8+10. The vents at stations 6+02 and 6+60 were extended approximately 5 feet above the top of the conduit to allow placement of embankment to pr oceed prior to completion of the grouting. Second stage grouting of the conduit from stations 5+79 to 6+02 began at the upstream grout connection, working downstream until grout had risen to the top of the air vent at station 6+02. The next day, it was observed that the grout had receded completely f rom the air vent s tandpipe. An additional 5 f t3 of grout was pumped into the air vent. For several days prior to beginning the grouting, it was observed that water was flowing from the bottom edge of the bulkhead at station 8+10. The wa ter wa s assumed to be entering the existing conduit through a joint in the concr ete at appr oximately s tation 7+00. Grouting of the f irst stage pr oceeded from stations 6+60 to 8+10, in an effort to push the water ahead of the grout and out the bulkhead. The flow of water from the bulkhead stopped after the initial grout set, but then resumed severa l hours la ter, with just a trickle flowing from the bottom edge of the bulkhead. Problems were encounter ed with gr outing of the second s tage due to leakage of grout from the contact between the bulkhead and the pipe. The contractor attempted to us e various fillers , but res orted to placement of a filet weld between the pipe and the bulkhead. Grouting of the s econd s tage proceeded f rom s tations 8+10 to 6+60, in an ef fort to minimize entr apment of air and dilution of grout in the downstream portion of the conduit. Grouting continued until grout was observed in the air vents at stations 6+60 and 8+10. The following day, the gr out had r eceded in the vent at s tation 8+10. Additional gr out was added at the vent, requiring les s than 2 gallons to fill the vent. Seepage of water from the bulkhead did not occur after grouting was completed. The plugs installed in the gr out connections were ground down f lush with the interior pipe surface and seal welded, per specification requirements. Several days later, it was noticed that water was seeping from two of the connection points. These connections were in the vicinity of the concr ete joint in the exis ting conduit approximately at s tation 7+00. Presumably, a s mall void had developed between the pipe a nd the surrounding grout, a llowing a path for the wa ter to seep into the existing conduit at the joint. The leaking gr out connections were welded again, which effectively stopped the seepage. The 2-inch diameter air vents extending through the bulkheads at stations 6+03 and 6+60 (us ed for grouting of the annular space) wer e removed. The 2-inch diameter pipe was removed at the thr eaded coupler s (10 inches below the top of the conduit) and the void r epaired us ing sand and cement dr y-pack. B-65 Conduits through Embankment Dams The uncoated inter ior surfaces of the newly ins talled 52- inch diameter pipe and damaged paint coating on the existing pipe were sand blasted and painted. These areas consisted of the weld joints, grout connections, and miscellaneous scrapes and gouges throughout the length of the conduit. Paint coa tings were a pplied with two applications of DeVoe High B uild Epoxy. Mil thicknes s readings taken indicated the first coat was 7 mils and the s econd coat, applied the next day, checked out at only 14 mils. The paint subcontractor subsequently returned and applied a third coat, to build the coating thicknes s to the 16 mils required by the s pecifications . Final applications of DeVoe High Build Epoxy were made on weld areas and damaged paint s urfaces of the 54- inch diameter pipe, which completed all wor k associated with the pipe. Lessons learned Grouting operations must be well planned and closely monitored. Grouting operations may require field adjustment to accommodate any seepage encounter ed.

Downs tream hazar ds include r oadways , railroad tr acks, and a residence. The embankment dam is essentially an offstream basin, and nearly all inflow is pumped into the basin from a nearby wash plant. The embankment dam was constructed in 1988 as a \"temporary sediment basin.\" Although an engineer prepared plans for the s tructure, no engineer ing supervision was provided during construction. Local materials (decomposed shale and erodible silts) were us ed to cons truct the embankment dam. A CMP s pillway with conventional antis eep collar s was cons tructed in a tr ench excavated into the foundation and backfilled with low plas ticity s ilts and decompos ed rock fragments from the excavation (f igure B-54). The structure was placed into us e the following year, and it failed upon firs t filling. When the pool level was only about 2 to 3 feet deep, flow along the outside of the pipe res ulted in los s of the adjacent s oils by internal eros ion (figure B -55).

Reference Maryland Dam Safety Division, Dam file No. 318. B-68 Appendix B conduit f ailure Olufson Dam was a privately owned embankment dam located in Pierce County, near Gig Harbor, Washington that experienced an outlet works conduit failure. The embankment dam was 18 feet high, with a s torage capacity of 15 acr e-feet and 21 acre-feet at the top of the dam. The principal s pillway cons isted of a 2-foot square, concrete, drop inlet conduit. An open channel in the abutment served as an emergency s pillway. The embankment dam was cons tructed in the 1960s without the benef it of engineer ing plans . The owner did all the wor k hims elf, including placing earthfill and mixing his own concrete ons ite. Conditions expos ed by the failure s uggest that the elements of the cons truction that required s kill were substandard. In particular, the concrete work suffered from inadequate cement content, poor overall mix gradation, and improper reinforcing. Thick steel cable was substituted, in par t, for conventional r einforcing steel. Likewis e, thes e cables were improperly positioned in the conduit section thus minimizing its enhancement of the tensile load capacity of the conduit. To limit concrete volumes, it appeared the owner had embedded bricks , rocks and concrete rubble into the walls as a filler during concr ete pour s. This practice, ter med cyclopean concr ete cons truction, has been s uccessfully us ed in lar ge gravity s tructures, but was inappr opriate f or thin walled, concrete box conduits. On December 11, 1996, a s inkhole 20 f eet in diameter and 17 f eet deep opened up in the crest of the emba nkment da m (figure B-56). At the time the sinkhole developed, the property on which the embankment dam sat was uninhabited due to the recent death of the pr operty owner . The sinkhole was discovered by neighbor s walking the s treambed to inves tigate the caus e of muddy s treamflows. This was fortuitous in that the sinkhole was discovered before it lead to an embankment failure. The sinkhole appeared to have resulted from a collapse in the top section of the cas t-in-place box culver t that s erved as the pr incipal r eservoir outlet. The failed segment of the conduit allowed overlying masses of embankment soil, over time, to repeatedly dr op into the conduit, wher e flows then f lushed the s oil downs tream. This sequence of events was supported by the record of stream flows in a downstream gauging station. The gauge record shows normal flows interrupted by a series of near zero creek flows immediately followed by short, abnormally high channel dis charges. The zero flows are inter preted as incidences of soil mas ses falling into and plugging the conduit. The following anomalous high flows repres ent a blowing out of the plug and a release of backwater in the conduit and inlet tower upstream of the plug. B-69 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure B-56 .\u2014Sinkhole i n the d am crest the ni ght of Decem ber 11, 1996. As an immediate response to the threat of an embankment dam breach, county maintenance s taff filled the s inkhole with s ome 200 yards of angular cobbles and boulder s. The State dam s afety staff saw no viable alter native to the county's scheme to addr ess the immediate cr isis. Finer grained s oils would likely have been s luiced through the top of the collapsed box conduit. This could have worsened the situation by plugging what limited outlet capacity remained after sediment had largely blocked the conduit. Nonetheles s, it was obvious that the rockfill was but an interim meas ure, and immediate f ollow- up action was neces sary to lower the r eservoir and permanently r esolve the public s afety thr eat. Three days of pumping wer e neces sary to lower the r eservoir to allow excavating a tr apezoidally s haped br each of the embankment dam (f igure 57). The floor of the br each was armored with a geotextile fabric and capped with much of the r ock or iginally dumped into the void the night of the f ailure. To impr ove f ish passage, an attempt was made to include a number of pools along the breach channel at the direction of the Washington State Department of Fis h and Wildlife. The Was hington State Water Quality s taff as sisted in blanketing the disturbed sections of the embankment dam with hay to minimize furthe r sedime nts entering the water course. Damage downstream was limited to the streambed. Primarily, it occurred in the form of stream habitat degradation from sediment deposition. Many of the salmon eggs in this fish-producing stream were smothered under sediments for several hundreds of yards downstream of the embankment dam. As bad as it was, the emer gency action pr evented a likely f ailure of the embankment dam. Thus, the B-70 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories Figure B-57 .\u2014View of ups tream dam crest nea ring completion of br each. possible threat of loss of life was averted along with extensive damage to property abutting the strea mbed. Lessons learned An examination of the failed conduit through the embankment dam revealed it to be of poor quality with minimal reinforcing. What reinforcing was provided, consisted of misplaced, s teel cable r ather than conventional def ormed bar s. Given the construction of the conduit, it is remarkable that it functioned for over 30 years. This failure reinforces the concer n that conduits have a def inite s ervice lif e, meas ured in decades . At the end of that s ervice lif e, they r equire retrofitting f or their continued satisfactory functioning. A failure to do so, risks a failure of the embankment dam. Proper care taken in the design and construction can materially increase the conduit service life. Conversely, poor workmanship may reduce it. Periodic inspection of conduits is required to confirm that they are structurally sound, and to provide timely notice of a developing problem with age.

B-71 Conduits through Embankment Dams Proje ct name: Pablo Dam Montana Summary: Removal of an exis ting outlet wor ks Pablo Dam is located near Polson, Montana on the Flathead Indian R eservation. The embankment dam is an earthfill s tructure cons isting of a main dam and dikes , which flank both sides of the dam, south and north. The crest elevation of the main dam is at 3220, and the dikes are at 3217. The main dam has a structural height of 43 feet, a cr est length of 10,550 f eet, a cr est width of 20 feet, a 3:1 ups tream slope, and a 2:1 downstream slope. The north dike has a crest length of 5850 feet, and the south dike has a crest length of 10,250 f eet. The crest width of both dikes is 12 feet. Pablo Dam was constructed in three phases over 24 years. In 1911, the embankment was constructed to elevation 3202. The second construction in 1918 raised the embankment dam to elevation 3209, and the final construction in 1934 raised the dam to the pr esent elevation 3220. Pablo Dam is an of fstream s tructure that is fed by the Pablo Feeder Canal. The purpose of the embankment dam is to impound water for irrigation. The reservoir has a capacity of 28,400 acre-feet at elevation 3211.0. The original outlet wor ks was situated at the maximum s ection of the dam and consisted of a 42-foot high concrete intake structure with two 3- by 5-foot slide gates. The original outlet works consisted of three box shaped conduits. The middle and s outh conduits were 172 f eet long and 4.5 f eet wide by 5 f eet high. The nor th conduit was about 136 feet long and 3.0 feet square. This north conduit was abandoned prior to the third phase of original construction. Differential s ettlement between the intake tower and the outlet wor ks conduits caused some of fset in \"s liding joints .\" This settlement was expected, as \"sliding joints \" (no r einforcement cr ossing the joint) wer e included in the or iginal des ign. However , continued s ettlement of the intake s tructure and the f irst 13 f eet of the conduits required grouting of the foundation shortly after construction. No further settlement has been detected in the las t 50 plus years. The first sliding joint is displa ced vertically about 2 inc hes and spra ys water at high reservoir he ad. Morta r filling in all s liding joints was disbonded, cracked, and deteriorating. Tensile cracks were also discovered along the length of the conduit. Water was commonly leaking from both the cr acks and the s liding joints , and ther e are signs of possible inter nal erosion of embankment material occurring in a few areas . Spalling concrete had been dis covered in the walls of the conduits . The concr ete in the center wall at the B-72 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories downs tream end of the conduits was deter iorated, r esulting in expos ed aggr egate and rebar. Dam safety modifications were begun in 1993, consisting of injection of polyurethane grout into cracks and conduit joints. A two-man crew from McCabe Brothers Drilling of Idaho Falls , Idaho, mobilized to the job s ite. They ins talled ventilation ductwork into the two outlet works conduits and began drilling injection holes in the south conduit. Existing cracks (mostly at construction joints) upstream of station 1+27 wer e injected with polyur ethane r esin grout to s top leakage thr ough the cracks. This was done prior to repair of spalled concrete in the conduits. The subcontractor used a ratio of polyurethane to water of 1.3:1, which effectively stopped 90 percent of the seepage. However, after completing injection of cracks in the south conduit, s eepage began to migr ate downs tream and appear in cr acks that were previous ly dry. During drilling of the injection holes , two voids were dis covered, one in the crown of each conduit at s tation 0+13. The voids were appr oximately 12 inches deep and 24 inches wide and s eemed to be connected to each other . Old cons truction drawings showed this as the location wher e concr ete counter fort walls , which support the intake tower, meet the conduits. No voids were found behind any of the other cracks. The voids at station 0+13 wer e injected with polyur ethane. As injection of the south conduit was completed, some migration of polyurethane was noted through the crown and divider wall of the middle conduit. In mid-November, McCabe B rothers Drilling completed injecting polyurethane res in into cr acks in the outlet wor ks conduits . They injected a total of 305 gallons into the two conduits (the s pecified quantity was 50 gal). As the injection oper ation progressed from upstream to downstream, cracks that had been previously dry near the canal outlet began to s eep water . Therefore, thes e cracks were injected als o. Becaus e the s eepage appear ed to be f ollowing the exter ior of the conduits and exiting f arther downs tream, the s eepage continued to be unf iltered and may incr ease the inter nal pressures in the embankment. A decis ion was made to ins tall weep drains in the conduit a nd to construct a filter colla r about the exterior of the wa lls. A modif ication to the contr act was issued to pr ovide f or this additional wor k. After the polyur ethane injection was completed, the conduits were unwater ed and inspected. Repair areas were mar ked, and the contr actor began chipping out and preparing the surfaces of the repair areas for epoxy-bonded concrete. Approximately 30 small repairs and one large repair at the conduit outlet (splitter wall) were done to complete the conduit repairs option of the work. Smaller and shallow ar eas were repaired us ing an appr oved two- part epoxy mater ial. Larger areas were repaired with epoxy-bonded concrete. B-73 Conduits through Embankment Dams During an ins pection of the interior of the conduits in April 2001, it was discovered that material had been deposited inside the middle conduit near an opening in a construction joint. This was occurring through a hole in the floor of the middle conduit at a construction joint near station 1+30. Approximately 1 ft3 of silt and fine sand were deposited on the floor. However, this deposit was observed during the winter when no irrigation releases are made. More deposition may have occurred during irrigation season that was washed downstream and not observed. Consequently, the tota l volume of ma terial could ha ve been much grea ter tha n the 1 ft3 observed in 2001. Reclamation theorized that plugging this opening could result in redirecting the erosion through a different hole or crack in the conduit. Also, redirecting the erosion might cause a more dangerous path to develop along the foundation contact of the conduits, and a piping exit might develop downstream of the embankment dam. If the exit point wer e located within the outlet channel, early detection would be ver y difficult. Another area of concern was the condition of the north conduit that was reportedly plugged at each end prior to the final raise of Pablo Dam in 1932, but was never confirmed. Therefore, it could be possible that a nearly full reservoir head could exist at the end of the nor th conduit, which was less than 100 f eet from the downs tream toe of the dam. After much dis cussion between all involved par ties, it was decided to completely r emove and r eplace the or iginal outlet wor ks. As an interim measure, a temporary patch was installed over the opening to prevent additional material from being eroded into the conduit while allowing for relief of water pressures. The patch consisted of filter fabric under a metal screen. During March 2002, the geotextile portion of the patch ruptured and approximately 0.5 ft3 of silt and fine sand were deposited into the conduit. The patch was repaired soon after the r upture was discovered. Reservoir level r estrictions were implemented in April 2003 and were to be kept in place until the removal and replacement modifications could be completed. The construction of a new outlet works began in November 2004 and was completed in the by the s pring of 2005. The major aspects of the wor k included: Construction of a cofferdam to maintain an area free of water during construction. Clearing, grubbing, and stripping prior to excavation. Removing existing embankment dam slope protection. Excavating embankment materials to accommodate construction of the new outlet wor ks (Slopes transverse to the dam center line wer e excavated at 4H:1V).

Reference Bureau of Reclamat ion, Technical Construction Report-Pablo Dam Modification Contract No. CSKT/SOD Pasture Canyon Dam Location: Arizona Summary: Closed circuit television inspection of an outlet works conduit Pasture Canyon Dam is located on the Hopi Indian R eservation in Arizona. Pasture Canyon Dam is a homogenous embankment dam with a height of 17 feet. The embankment dam cr est is at elevation 4890.0 f eet, 20 f eet wide, and 632 f eet in length. The embankment dam was apparently founded on pervious, sandy alluvium. No information was available as to its construction. The embankment dam was completed in 1920s or 1930s and modified in 1975. The 1975 modification included a 3-foot cr est raise. Appurtenant s tructures at the s ite include an uncontrolled earthen s pillway and an outlet wor ks. The outlet wor ks is located within the embankment dam approximately 200 f eet from the lef t abutment. The outlet wor ks cons ists of a concrete intake structure, approximately 55 feet of 12-inch by 12-inch masonry conduit connected to 35 f eet of 14-inch diameter CMP connected to 20 f eet of 14-inch diameter concrete pipe. The intake structure contains a hand-operated slide gate. The discharge capacity of the outlet wor ks has been es timated to be 9 f t3/s. The Bureau of Reclamation's Technical Ser vice Center performed a CCT V inspection of the outlet works conduit at Pas ture Canyon Dam in April 2004. The conduit was accessed for inspection, via an existing manhole located at the downs tream end of the outlet wor ks. The camer a-crawler was inserted into the 14-inch diameter concrete pipe and was advanced upstream approximately 18 feet, where the concrete pipe ended and CMP began. Water clarity was somewhat poor and limited viewing thr oughout the conduit. The camer a-crawler was advanced upstream within the CM P for appr oximately 35 f eet, wher e the CM P ended and a masonry conduit began. The camer a-crawler was advanced ups tream within the masonry conduit f or appr oximately 30 mor e feet, wher e numer ous piles of sand wer e observed near the sidewalls of the masonry conduit. Figure B-59 shows a typical pile of sand near the sidewall of the conduit. In addition, just a few feet into the masonry conduit existed an open defect (crack) in the crown of the conduit. Figure B-60 shows the def ect at the cr own of the conduit. This defect allowed s and mater ials to enter the conduit. Based on observations made during the CCTV inspection, it was concluded that Pas ture Canyon Dam was in the proces s of failing by internal eros ion or backward erosion piping, and immediate action was required. Visual monitoring of the embankment dam and monitoring of the area around the outlet works was performed every 4 hours. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) imposed reservoir and gate operating restrictions at Pasture Canyon Dam.

The reservoir drawdown was limited to 1 f oot per day. After the r eservoir was lower ed to the des ired elevation, a siphon was installed to provide downstream irrigation releases. Figure B-61 shows the siphon discharge irrigation releases. Based on the deteriorated condition of the conduit, the BIA decided to abandon the outlet works by grouting it closed.

The downstream end was plugged using a burlap pig sealed with r edi-mix dry-pack. The bur lap pig acted as a filter to pr event gr out leakage, and the dr y-pack held the pig in place. Two grout plants were brought onsite. The grout mixer s had a volume of 45 gallons each. The plants were power ed by gasoline engine over a hydraulic system and were found to be very adequate for the grouting operations. Figure B-62 shows the grout plant used. Type II cement B-79 Conduits through Embankment Dams was utilized in the grout mix. The initial mix was 0.8:1 (water/cement ratio by volume). When it was deter mined that no pr oblems were encounter ed with the grouting operations, the mix was reduced to 0.7:1. A grout fluidfier was used in the grout mix. Upon completion of the grouting operations, an ASTM C33 sand filter was installed at the downs tream end of the conduit. Lessons learned CCT V ins pection equipment can be us ed to identif y deter iorated ar eas within inacces sible conduits . Expedited dam s afety actions require good communication between all interested par ties and agencies involved. A siphon can be constructed quickly and inexpensively in order to provide downstream irrigation re quire ments. Reference Bureau of Reclamat ion, Pasture Cany South Africa Summary: Failure of an embankment dam by internal erosion resulting from hydraulic fracture of earthfill adjacent to the outlet conduit In 1986, Piketburg Dam, a 40-foot high embankment dam was built acros s a minor tributar y of the Ver lore Vlei River , near the town of Piketber g in the Wes tern Cape, South Af rica. The new embankment dam was cons tructed over an exis ting dam at the site to incr ease storage. Figure B-63 shows a cross section of the embankment dam. After 5 weeks following cons truction, dur ing which water was pumped into the reservoir, and when it was almost full, major leakage suddenly appeared at the downstream toe of the embankment dam near the outlet. Within less than a day, the entire contents of the r eservoir had been los t through a caver n adjacent to the outlet conduit. Inspection af ter the event r evealed a major tunnel thr ough the entir e width of the embankment dam along the outlet conduit. At the time of the inspection, the roof of the tunnel had collaps ed over the entr y and exit. The center portion of the tunnel beneath the dam cr est, however , remained intact ar ching almos t 33 feet acr oss the tunnel. Large sinkholes were present in the ups tream slope of the dam. The embankment mater ial was broadly gr aded f rom coar se gravel s izes to clay s izes, typically with a liquid limit of 28 percent and plasticity index of 9. Both residual soil (decompos ed phyllite and gr eywacke) and tr ansported soil wer e utilized.

B-81 Conduits through Embankment Dams included gravelly clay gully was h depos ited in the form of an alluvial fan, as well as colluvium. Fine gr ained mater ial was intended to be r eserved for the des ignated cor e zone. The embankment dam design did not include provisions for either filtering or drainage of the core. Tests showed that the earthfill material was dispersive. During cons truction, gyps um was added to por tions of the cor e as a treatment f or dispersivity. The new outlet conduit was laid r oughly along the or iginal gr ound s urface, under the highes t section of the new dam. A pipe was placed in the bottom of a wide slot cut through the old embankment dam. The pipe was laid in a tr ench dug into the lowes t layer s of compacted fill that had already been placed, and then encas ed in reinforced concrete. Across the new core's foundation cutoff, plus along one other section, the outlet trench was deepened to weathered bedrock prior to filling with concrete, to improve bearing upon soft material present under those sections. Concrete antiseep collars were found to have been cas t over only the top and upper sides of the outlet encas ement. The collar s did not extend below the pipe encas ement. Breaching took place s oon after filling began and before the res ervoir was completely filled. This suggests that one or more concentrated leaks must have existed, to enable flow to reach the downstream toe so soon, long before the saturation front could have advanced very far into the earthfill. Failure s tarted at the downs tream toe in the vicinity of the outlet conduit, and the er osion tunnel terminated immediately adjacent to the ups tream end of the outlet encas ement. The initial concentr ated leaks alongs ide the outlet conduit ar e pos tulated to have occurred due to hydraulic fracture of the earthfill by the rapid ris e of the res ervoir. The conduit appear s to have allowed f or a low s tress zone to occur in the ear thfill next to the wall of the encas ement. In essence, the wall \"s hielded\" the adjacent f ill from the f ull weight of the over lying embankment. The stresses in this area wer e likely lower than the r eservoir head. A somewhat compr essible foundation mater ial beneath the conduit could have assisted in the formation of the crack completely along the embankment dam's cross section. Once concentr ated f low started, the dispersive nature of the embankment fill would have allowed for rapid eros ion from the downs tream exit of the cr ack, pr ogressing ups tream. Lack of any def ensive designs for embankment cracking, such as a filter and drain, contributed to the failure. Also contributing to the failure was the poor compaction of the earthfill material adjacent to the encas ement wall that was found dur ing the f orensic inves tigations . Also thought to contribute to the fa ilure were the potentia l for differentia l settlement of the new and old earthfill. Figure B-64 shows a cross section through the conduit area after failure.

Lessons learned The dam failure was likely caused by poor compa ction of the soil a djacent to the outlet conduit. Factors contributing to the poor compaction include inclus ion of antis eep collars and a poorly constructed concrete encas ement. A compr essible foundation may have assisted in the formation of a crack next to the conduit. Key changes to the des ign and cons truction that would have likely pr evented f ailure of the embankment dam include: Utilizing a conduit des ign that accommodated the likely s ettlements caused by the f oundation. If the concrete casement around the conduit had used battered side slopes rather than ver tical ones , compact ing soils against the conduit would have created mor e positive pr essures and lessened the potential for hydraulic fracture.

The embankment dam has a maximum height of 335 feet above the streambed, and a crest length of approximately 2,460 f eet. The river outlet wor ks is located near the r ight abutment of the embankment dam and cros ses the dam axis at station 11+69.07. Most of the outlet works was constructed under a Stage I contract during 1980 and 1981. The completed outlet works consists of a 50-foot long, 9-foot diameter diversion conduit, a drop inlet intake structure with a concrete plug, a 500-foot long, 9-foot diameter upstream conduit, a gate chamber with a 5- by 6-foot high pressure guard gate, 64-inch square regulating gates, a control house and equipment, and hydraulic jump stilling bas in. The spillway cons ists of a gloryhole intake exiting into a 6.5-foot diameter conduit located on a s helf on the lef t abutment of the dam.

Settlement and cr ack s urveys were taken, in the ups tream and downs tream conduits , in January of 1986 and October of 1986. The maximum s ettlement recorded in January of 1986 was about 0.74 f eet at s tation 11+24 in the downs tream conduit. For reference, the s tation at the center line of the gate chamber is located jus t downstream of the centerline of the embankment dam, station 7+50. In October of 1986, an additional s ettlement of about 0.22 f eet was recorded at s tation 11+24. Settlements of other points in the conduit varied, seemingly based on the stiffness of the foundation. Maximum tr ansverse cracking occur red in the ups tream conduit at station 7+80 and station 8+80. The dow nstream condui t had very little transverse cracking, but a maximum joint opening of about \u00bd inch occurred at station 10+73. Longitudinal cr acking occur red in the cr own and inver t between s tations 6+50 and 7+65 and between s tations 11+74 and in the ups tream and downs tream conduits , respectively. The settlement and cr acking occur red dur ing or after constructing the dam embankment to elevation 6830 in the 1985 construction season and topping out of the dam in 1986 at elevation 6886. The settlement and cr acking of concr ete in the ups tream conduit was addr essed by required injecting gr out in and ar ound the cr acks to reduce water leakage and potential backward erosion piping or internal erosion of surrounding soils in the embankment dam, along with protecting the conduit reinforcement from corrosion. Polyurethane r esin was used to gr out the tr ansverse cracks. Also, the polyur ethane resin grout was cons idered (due to its more flexible char acteristics over more rigid epoxy material) for grouting the longitudinal cracks. However, longitudinal cracks were grouted with epoxy material to provide a degree of s tructural s tability. Appr oximately 500 f eet of cracks were des ignated f or grouting. The contr actor B-85 Conduits through Embankment Dams grouted the cracks in February and March 1987 (figure B-66). Instrumentation was installed acr oss selected cr acks in the ups tream conduit, which could be r ead in the gate chamber to track opening of the cracks and additional settlement. This type of tracking was selected becaus e it is difficult and expens ive to unwater and ins pect the upstream conduit. The downs tream conduit is acces sible, and cr acking is routinely inspected. Lessons learned Settlement can occur even with bes t efforts to locate the conduit on competent foundation. Settlement along the alignment is not uniform and can result in cracking of the conduit. Grouting is an effective method for seating cracks and making the conduit water tight. Reference Bureau of R eclamation, Unpublished notes and file photographs.

Cons tructed in 1965, the 22-foot high, low hazard embankment dam contained a 24-inch diameter CMP spillway. The spillway ris er had been gradually deteriorating, and the owner had attempted r epairs at the top of the r iser by us e of a larger CMP sleeve and concr ete grout. However, no repairs to the lower portion of the riser were attempted, and the base of the riser collapsed on February 6, 1999. A large portion of the embankment dam was washed away, leaving a void about 30 f eet in diameter and 10 f eet deep around the original riser location (figure B-67). A CCTV inspection of the barrel portion of the CMP revealed that the remaining sections of pipe wer e in good condition. The engineer elected to s lipline the exis ting 24-inch diameter barrel with 20-inch (outs ide diameter) Snap-T ite\u00ae pipe (SDR 32.5). The space between the two pipes was filled with a gr out compos ed of fly ash and cement (compr essive strength 2,500 lb/in2), and a new aluminum r iser was constructed within the upstream portion of the embankment dam. Figure B-67 .\u2014When the 3 5-year old corruga ted m etal pipe riser colla psed, a large por tion of the low ha zard embankment da m was washed a way. This left a void about 30 feet i n diameter a nd 10 feet deep a round the original riser. B-87 Conduits through Embankment Dams A filter diaphragm was constructed around the downstream end of the pipe to contr ol seepage along the outs ide of the conduit. Lessons learned The use of Snap-T ite\u00ae HDPE allowed for rapid ins tallation of a s lipliner at a low hazard facility. No s pecialized contractors were needed to heat fus e the joints of the slipliner. Reference Deegan, J., Rolling Green Dam Co mpletion Sliplining of an exis ting outlet works conduit us ing HDPE Constructed in 1937 and enlarged in 1953, Round Rock Dam is a 35-foot high embankment dam, located about 3 miles from the town of R ound R ock, Arizona on the Navajo Res ervation. The original outlet wor ks at Round Rock Dam was constructed by cut and cover methods. Both the upstream and downstream outlet works conduits were cons tructed of 24-inch diameter CMP. Res ervoir releases are contr olled by a 24- inch diameter slide gate in a concr ete wet well located about 15 feet ups tream of the dam cr est. In 1991, the B ureau of Reclamation's Deficiency Verification Analys is identif ied the s tructural integr ity of the outlet wor ks conduits as a dam safety deficiency. CCTV inspection had detected corroded portions and joint separations in the CMP. Reclamation designed a modification, to address this dam safety deficiency, which consisted of an 18-inch O.D.

The lake is an integral part in an ups cale land development. When the construction permit application was submitted to the State for approval, the designer included a 16-inch diameter PVC diversion pipe in the base of the embankment dam to prevent impoundment of water while the dam was being built. The construction permit was ultimately approved with the condition that the pipe would be filled with grout when the embankment dam was completed. During construction, some foundation problems were discovered that required grouting of the f oundation. The contr actor was allowed to cons truct the lower portion of the embankment dam, and the grouting contractor was allowed to drill through it to grout the foundation. During this process, the contractor apparently observed a small amount of grout flowing from the outlet end of the temporary PVC diversion pipe (However, this was not reported to the State until after a problem with the pipe was later discovered). As the work on the embankment dam neared completion and it came time to abandon the temporary diversion pipe with grout, the owner (through his designer) reques ted permis sion to alter the plans . Instead of filling the pipe with concrete, the owner proposed to retain the pipe and place a valve on the downstream end of the pipe. Their argument was that this would allow them to us e the P VC pipe to lower the lake level in the future. The state Dam Safety Program balked at this , and it quickly became a contentious issue between the State and the dam owner . In an effort to assess the condition of the PVC pipe prior to making a final decision the State us ed a r emotely oper ated video camer a to examine the inter ior of the pipe. With the owner and his engineer present, a video camer a was inserted into the downstream end of the pipe. At approximately 450 feet upstream of the pipe outlet, a sepa rated joint wa s observed (figure B-70). Just upstrea m of tha t joint, the pipe had collaps ed, leaving a s pace only a f ew inches high at the bottom (f igure B-71) The pipe was immediately abandoned by completely filling it with grout. The owner later admitted that if the State had not been able to demons trate why it did not want a valve on the downstream end of the pipe, he would have tried to coerce the State to allow the pipe to remain by contacting his legislators or by going B-91 Conduits through Embankment Dams Figure B-70 .\u2014An open joi nt was discovered i n a 16-inch PVC tem porary diversion pipe under the 118- foot hi gh embankment dam.

If they had pr oceeded with the modif ication, this would have r esulted in an unsafe pipe, subjected to full reservoir of more than 100 feet of head pressure running through the base of the embankment dam, with a valve at the downstream end. The presence of the s eparated pipe joint could ultimately have r esulted in a disaster. B-92 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories The caus e of failure of the P VC diver sion pipe was not deter mined. The caus e may have been the result of the grouting work, poor construction practices, faulty pipe, or a combination of these factors. Lessons learned Internal inspection of all conduits within an embankment dam should be conducted at the end of cons truction to ens ure that the conduits are not exces sively def ormed and that they will perform as intended. PVC pipe is not recommended for us e in high or s ignificant hazard embankment dams , unles s it is fully encas ed in reinforced cast-in-place concrete. A better des ign would allow the permanent s pillway to als o function as a temporary diversion and would avoid the use of temporary conduits, which are intended to be abandoned in place.

The Salmon Lake Dam reservoir (Conconully Lake) was a natural lake prior to construction of the embankment dam in 1921. The embankment dam is an earthfill s tructure with a s tructural height of 54 feet, a cr est length of 1,260 f eet at elevation 2325.1 (2330.25 or iginal datum), and a crest width of 14 feet. The reservoir has an active s torage capacity of 10,540 acre-feet and a s urface area of 310 acres at spillway cres t and normal res ervoir elevation 2318.68 (2324.25 original datum). The uncontrolled automatic s iphon s pillway and gate tower are located in the left abutment of the embankment dam. A trashrack prevents debris from entering the spillway. The siphon s pillway cons ists of a tras hrack intake tructure, vertical haft, and a \"goos e-neck\" tr ansition s ection that leads to the downs tream outlet conduit. The spillway dis charge capacity at res ervoir water s urface elevation 2318.68 (2324.25 original datum) is 400 ft3/s. Outlet are controlled by two 3-foot by 4-foot 6-inch cast-iron slide gates with two hand-operated gate lifts. The gates have a combined discharge capacity of about 500 ft3/s at res ervoir elevation 2318.68 (2324.25 original datum) when operated s eparately from the s pillway. The outlet works cons ists of a tras hrack intake s tructure, a 4- foot 6- inch diameter upstream conduit, a contr ol tower containing the s lide gates , a 4-foot 6- inch diameter downs tream conduit, and transition into an open cut channel. The concrete conduit has a minimum concrete thicknes s of 9 inches . Both the outlet works and s pillway s hare a common downs tream conduit with a tr ansition immediately downs tream from the gate. Man-entry inspection of the downs tream conduit was preformed in November 2000 and revealed poor quality concrete on eroded lift lines where, in at least one location, a ruler could be ins erted beyond the thicknes s of the concr ete. The mos t severe damage to the concr ete was located appr oximately 110 f eet ups tream from the outlet portal. A decision was made to perform concrete repairs on the poorest areas the downstream conduit. In preparation of the repair work in March 2001, a tap was inserted into a cr ack in the conduit appr oximately 190 f eet ups tream of the outlet portal in order to control seepage that was entering the conduit. Figure B-72 shows B-94 Appendix B downstrea m condui t. seepa ge into the conduit prior to insta llation of the ta p. At this loca tion, it wa s discovered that a void approximately 12 inches in depth existed behind the conduit wall. The concrete in this section of the conduit, which had previously been described as good, was determined to have 3 to 4 inches of somewhat sound concrete, backed by approximately 6 inches of loosely bonded aggregate or rubble. In subsequent explorations, it was determined that the void extended a minimum of 3 feet ups tream and 4 f eet downs tream from the tap and was appr oximately 3 f eet high. The repairs amounted to jackhammering the eroded areas and soft spots and patching holes in the concrete. Repairs were made at locations identified during man-entry inspections and at some other locations where poor quality concrete was encounter ed. A lar gely uns uccessful attempt was made to gr out the void behind the conduit wall located about 190 f eet ups tream of the outlet por tal. This was attempted using a hand grout pump, which proved to be ina dequate (pa rtially due to the existing seepage gradients). One observation during concrete repairs was that only hoop steel was encountered in the concrete conduit. Additional man-entry ins pection was performed in May 2001 following the completion of the concrete repairs with the intent of evaluating possible modification alternatives. The concrete deterioration and erosion in the interior of the downs tream conduit was cons idered unus ual and pos sibly an indication of concrete with low s trength and poor durability. The current condition of the concrete indica tes tha t deteriora tion a nd leakage into a nd out of the conduit will worsen with time. The condition of the concrete may also be indicating a potential B-95 Conduits through Embankment Dams for loss of structura l strength over time. Water tests were performed to determine if the water in the r eservoir and the conduit wer e acidic or contained anything that would be detr imental to the concr ete. The water tests results were negative, and it was concluded that the condition of the concrete could be a result of poor consolidation and possibly other poor construction practices. The ups tream conduit had never been ins pected, s ince the r eservoir would need to be drawn down to the level of the intake structure. In lieu of reservoir drawdown, an underwater inspection was performed in September 2001 to assess the condition of the concr ete. The diver s found the concr ete in the intake s tructure to be in ver y good condition with no signs of deterioration. The concrete in the upstream conduit did not appear to be in as good of condition as the intake structure. The divers inspected and videotaped appr oximately 80 linear feet of the conduit. A knif e was used to probe cracks and deteriorated areas in the concrete. Figure B-73 shows the diver using a knife to probe a crack in the conduit. In general, the crown of the upstream conduit was in the best condition, with most of the concrete being smooth and free of voids. The floor of the conduit is mostly smooth to 1/8-inch relief. The sides of the conduit were in the poorest condition with concrete relief being 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick with localized ar eas to 3/4 inch thick. Some areas of uncons olidated concrete were observed on the sides of the upstream conduit, but did not appear to be as severe as what was observed on the downstream conduit. The divers also inspected the upstream sides of the two 3-foot by 4-foot 6-inch cast-iron slide gates. During the inspection, the divers took care not to stir up particles on the invert, to avoid reducing the water vis ibility to near zero. Due to the poor condition of the concrete within the downstream conduit and voids on the outside of the conduit, a decision was made to perform outlet works modifica tions to mitiga te the existing da m safety deficiencies. In 2003, a 48-inch inside diameter steel liner was installed, and the annulus between the s teel liner and existing concrete conduit was backfill grouted. As part of the outlet works modif ications , a filter collar was installed ar ound the downs tream end of the conduit. The upstream conduit was determined to be of adequate condition to continue in service without repair, but underwater inspection should be made at regular 6-year intervals . Lessons learned Man-entry inspection should be used to evaluate the condition of the conduit for both temporary repairs and permanent renovations. Where feasible, divers should be used to perform underwater inspections of conduits that cannot be dewatered.

B-97 Conduits through Dams name: Sardis Dam Location: Mississippi Summary: A sinkhole developed over an outlet works conduit due to material being eroded through a joint Sardis Dam is a hydraulic fill embankment dam cons tructed by the Corps of Engineers and was placed in s ervice in 1940. Sardis Dam is 15,300 feet in length with an aver age height of 97 feet. The outlet wor ks is located in the lef t abutment. The outlet works consists of a n intake tower with four ga ted pa ssages, a nd these passages transition in a 64-foot long monolith to a single \"egg\" shaped reinforced concrete conduit. The 18.25- by 16-foot conduit is founded on fine Tertiary sand and was cast in place. The walls of the conduit ar e 3.25 f eet thick. The conduit consists of 17 monoliths, each 30 feet in length. Copper waterstops were placed at each monolith joint. The conduit dis charges into a concrete s tilling bas in, which has baffle blocks for energy dissipation. In December 1974, a s inkhole occur red above the monolith joint at the junction of the inta ke tower a nd the upstrea m end of the tra nsition monolith. Figure B-74 shows the location of the sinkhole. Sinkhole investigation revealed that the intake tower is founded on piles, but the transition is not founded on piles. This allowed the tra nsition monolith to settle a bout 1 inch more tha n the inta ke tower. This differential settlement was enough to rupture the copper waterstop. With water in the conduit being free flowing (nonpressurized conduit), and water pressure outside the conduit being near lake s tage, a large pres sure differential exis ted acros s this joint. This large pres sure differential caus ed flow through the joint after the water stop r uptured. The water flowing thr ough the joint car ried enough mater ial to eventually caus e the s inkhole to occur . The solution to this problem was to fill the s inkhole with impervious material and to drill grout holes in this monolith joint all the way through the concrete into the surrounding s oil along the entire perimeter of the joint. The holes were drilled from inside the tr ansition. Neat cement gr out was then pumped thr ough thes e holes to fill any voids outside the tra nsition a nd to sea l the wa terstop a s well a s possible. Prior to grouting, the gates were clos ed and s ealed with s aw dus t, air compr essors and a grouting machine were s et up in the backfill area of the s tilling bas in, and s upply lines were run up the conduit to the transition monolith to be grouted. The lake stage was at its normal level f or that time of the year , and the elevation of the lake was about 20 feet above the invert of the conduit. Twelve grout holes were drilled in the monolith joint, four in the invert, four in the crown, and two in each s ide wall. Each hole was installed as follows : (1) A hole about 2 inches in diameter was drilled B-98 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories Figure B-74 .\u2014A sinkhole occur red above the m onolith joint at the juncti on of the i ntake tower and the upstr eam end of the tr ansition secti on. with a jack hammer to a depth of about 2 feet, and (2) a 1\u00bd-inch pipe with a ball valve on the upper end wa s then grouted into the hole. After the grout ha d set up, a jack hammer with bit small enough to go inside the 1\u00bd-inch pipe was used to drill the res t of the way through the conduit to the foundation or backfill material. When foundation or backfill material was encountered, the holes would s tart to flow. The jack hammer with bit was then r emoved, and the ball valve was closed to pr event the hole from flowing. A water jet pipe was used to clean out the grout pipe just prior to grouting. At the end of the grouting operation, the ball valves were removed, and caps were placed on the grout pipes. The first hole gr outed took 12 cubic f eet, and the take per hole decr eased for each succeeding hole. A total of 40.5 cubic f eet of neat cement gr out was pumped ar ound the joint. The cement gr out was anticipated to be br ittle, and ther e was some concer n that any additional s ettlement of the f oundation could caus e this neat cement to cr ack. However, this repair was completed more than 30 years ago and no other sink holes have developed. B-99 Conduits through Embankment Dams Lessons learned The problem was caus ed by a br oken water stop, which was the r esult of differential settlement. To prevent this on future designs, the monolith joints should be designed s o that ther e can be es sentially no dif ferential s ettlement at the monolith joint.

A centra l amenity of the development was an existing reservoir impounded by an old earthen embankment dam with inadequate s pillway capacity. In addition to widening the earthen emergency s pillway, five PVC s iphon pipes were installed in tr enches excavated thr ough the cr est of the embankment. The des ign called for the pipes to be bedded in concrete. Control valves were ins talled in the siphons at the top of the embankment dam inside of manhole structures. In 2002, the owner noted the pres ence of water flowing out of a hole in the embankment adjacent to the siphons, approximately 15 feet downstream of the valve manhole. The owner contacted the design engineer, who performed exploratory inves tigations in an attempt to locate the s ource of the s eepage. The engineer recommended ins tallation of a drainage s ystem to contr ol the s eepage. However , this did not work, and the s eepage s ituation continued to get wors e. In 2003, during a storm, the owner attempted to operate the s iphon s pillways , and found the manholes full of water and that the seepage had substantially increased. An internal CCTV inspection of the siphons found no problems with the PVC pipes . The engineer suspected that f low was occur ring under the pipes and advis ed the owner to replace the siphons. Upon excavation and removal of the pipes, it was found that the original contractor had not achieved adequate placement of the concrete cradle, resulting in voids under the center of each siphon. Constant flow through these voids under the pipes resulted in internal erosion of the underlying embankment soils. Lessons learned (adapted from W ilson and M onroe) Siphon s pillways do not always work as expected, es pecially when cons tructed by an inexperienced contractor. Thorough construction oversight is required. A filter should be used in conjunction with conduit penetrations through embankment dams.

The original outlet wor ks at Turtle Lake Dam was cons tructed by cut and cover methods. The outlet works conduits were constructed of concrete pressure pipe in approximately 4-foot long sections. The upstream conduit and the first 40 feet of the downs tream conduit wer e 21- inch diameter pipe. The ver tical wet well s haft at the ups tream edge of the dam cr est separates the ups tream and downs tream conduits and hous es a 24- inch diameter slide gate, which r egulates discharges. The remainder of the downs tream conduit (340 f eet, much of which extends downs tream of the toe of the embankment dam) is 18-inch diameter. During the 1996-1997 winter, a s inkhole was discovered above the lower reaches of the downstream conduit. Investigations showed that a root ball had partially plugged the outlet, and portions of the pipe had partially collapsed. During the late spring of 1997, the Bureau of R eclamation designed a temporary repair for the deteriorating outlet wor ks. Becaus e of the s mall size of the conduit and the concer n for seepage coming into the conduit, it was decided that a water tight liner should be us ed. The conduit downs tream of the embankment dam toe was excavated, but it was not desirable to excavate in the embankment dam its elf.

The embankment height was about 31 feet and it contained about 61,000 cubic yards of earthfill. The principal spillway conduit is a 36-inch diameter reinforced concrete pipe. The embankment dam was constructed in an area of Oklahoma now known to have a high concentr ation of dispersive clays . The embankment s oils classify as CL in the Unified System with an LL of about 35 and a PI of about 15. The dispersive clays are produced from weathering of Permian or Pennsylvanian age shales of marine origin. The sodium r ich par ent mater ial produce dis persive clays that ar e highly erodible. The embankment dam failed in 1986 by internal eros ion when the res ervoir filled suddenly to a r eservoir elevation higher than the r eservoir had pr evious ly ever impounded water. At the time of the failure, the res ervoir was about 1.6 feet below the top of the crest of the embankment dam. The embankment dam had impounded water continuously at a lower reservoir elevation for most of its history, until the r ainfall event that f illed the r eservoir to this unpr ecedented higher elevation. Most often, failures similar to this one occur when the res ervoir fills suddenly s oon after completion of the embankment dam. This failure occur red however when a \"second firs t filling\" type of event occurred. The site had previous ly filled to a pool level corresponding to about one-third of the embankment dam height (the dam is a flood control single purpose reservoir), and maintained that pool for most of the 13 years of its life. A large rainfall event caus ed water to rapidly fill the res ervoir and water flowed through the auxiliary s pillway, but not over the cres t of the embankment dam in 1986. Cracks in the earthfill in the upper part of the embankment dam allowed water to find a pathway thr ough uns aturated dis persive clay fill us ed to cons truct the embankment dam. The crack(s ) in the embankment dam quickly er oded and a br eaching type f ailure of the dam r esulted. The cracks in the embankment dam were thought to be a result of a combination of hydraulic fracture and desiccation. The failure tunnel was located about 40 feet to the side of the conduit that penetrated the embankment dam, in the area of the old stream channel. B-105 Conduits through Embankment Dams The differential s ettlement that helped to cr eate s tress conditions favorable to hydraulic f ractur e was probably as sociated with the pr esence of a channel thr ough the embankment dam that had r elatively s teep s ide slopes and the pr esence of the principal s pillway conduit in the vicinity. Internal eros ion failures in similar embankment dams constructed by the NR CS in Oklahoma were often near principal spillway conduits . Differential s ettlement is a primary contributor to conditions favorable to hydraulic fracture. The failure of the embankment dam was observed as it occurred from an aerial survey of the site. Figure B-77 shows the failure of the embankment dam as it occur red. Water in the r eservoir had r isen to about 1.6 f eet below the cr est of the embankment dam following about 19 inches of rainfall which had occurred over several days . Water had flowed over the cres t of the auxiliary s pillway, but had not overtopped the embankment dam. Water was observed to be flowing through a tunnel developing in the embankment dam at about 40 feet to the side of the conduit location. Water entered the upstream slope of the embankment dam at about the maximum res ervoir level in s everal locations and exited the downs tream s lope of the embankment dam through an erosion tunnel. Water exited the downstream slope about one-third of the way up from the toe of the embankment dam. The tunnel that developed in the embankment dam eroded quickly and drained the pool to about one-half of the embankment height.

B-106 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories Lessons learned The incident demonstrated that although failures by hydraulic fracture may be most common in firs t filling incidents , a potential for failures still exis ts years after the firs t filling. The soils were known to be highly dis persive, but des igners thought that by placing the dispersive soils above the elevation of the permanent pool, the threat to the embankment dam could be reduced.

B-107 Conduits through Embankment Dams Proje ct name: Waterbury Dam Location: Vermont Summary: Design and construction of a filter diaphragm around an existing outlet works conduit Water bury Dam is 150 f eet high acr oss much of a valley except over the or iginal river gorge, wher e it appr oaches 190 f eet high. The embankment dam cons ists of a wide central impervious core (CL and ML) flanked by sand and gravel (SM and GM) shells upstream and downs tream. A large rock fill zone extends acros s the toe of the main embankment s ection. The dam is founded on a thick glacial s ilt depos it beneath the western two-thirds of the embankment dam, and directly on the schist bedrock beneath the eastern third of the dam. The internal erosion of embankment dam and/or foundation silts into and through the rockfill zone attracted attention in the late 1970s . A section of the rockfill toe along the western portion of the embankment dam was reconstructed and treated by a filter injection proces s in the mid-1980s . At that time, a s eparate internal eros ion condition was revealed in the portion of the embankment dam over the original river gorge. Internal voids were treated us ing the f ilter injection pr ocess. From 1985 thr ough the late 1990s , seepage conditions within the gor ge area of the dam failed to completely s tabilize. In 1999, inves tigations concluded that additional remedial action was needed. The remediation included placing a f ilter drain to intercept any s eepage that might occur along the inter face between the conduit and the embankment materials around the downstream end of the existing outlet conduit. The outlet conduit consists of a horseshoe-shaped reinforced concrete conduit placed within a bedrock excavation. Within the impervious core zone, the conduit is mostly within the conf ined bedr ock excavation, and imper vious mater ial was compacted us ing hand tamper s. The east wall of the excavation cons ists of a near-vertical excavated r ock wall with s ome localized over hanging r ock ledges . These conditions led to the concern for potential internal erosion along the conduit or along the inter face with the s teep r ock surface. Expos ure of the conduit r equired a lar ge excavation into the downs tream sand and gravel s hell (20,000 yd3) and rock fill (10,000 yd3) zones of the embankment dam. Hand-placed riprap from the dam surface was stripped, processed to remove fine mater ials, and eventually r eplaced on the embankment s urface. Within the s hell, excavation s lopes were 1.5H:1V, and within the rock fill s lopes were 1H:1V. In spite B-108 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories of several very hard rains , there were no s tability problems . About 160 feet of the conduit, entirely within the rockfill zone, was expos ed. The drain, consisting of a coarse inner zone and a fine outer filter zone, was wrapped around the outer surface of the expos ed conduit. At the ups tream end of the excavation, an expanded f ilter diaphr agm was placed f rom the eas tern bedr ock surface to the wes tern rock fill excavation s urface. The diaphragm extended about 5 feet above the cr own of the conduit. The drain cons isted of a coars e drainage fill (AASHT O No. 7 s tone) to act as a carrying medium f or collected s eepage, and a f iner sand zone (Ver mont concr ete sand) to a ct as a filter to prevent the infiltra tion of fines from the surrounding rockfill materials . The 18-inch thick cours e zone was placed around the drainpipe and f illed the ir regular space between the over hanging eas tern bedr ock wall and the conduit s urface. The fine filter zone was also a minimum of 18 inches thick, but was broadened to fill the excavation wedge along the wes tern s ide of the conduit. See figure B-78 for c ross se ction. The filter and inner coars e drainage fill zone were des igned to meet filter criteria with respect to each other , and the f ilter was designed to handle the s ilts within the f ine matrix material within the adjacent rock fill zone. The low-plas ticity glacial s ilts, whether foundation s ilts, core material, or rock fill matrix fines , have always been the primary concer n with r espect to inter nal erosion. A relatively f ine filter mater ial is required to meet f ilter criteria. The exact limits of the rockfill zone were not known, although s ome of the original drawing information suggested that the proposed excavation would completely penetrate the rock fill to the contact with the s hell zone. As the excavation progres sed, it became apparent that the rock fill zone would not be completely penetrated as hoped. Therefore, it was decided to install a horizontal drain through the remaining wedge of rockfill to intercept s eepage before it dis persed into the rockfill zone. The drain was drilled within the conf ined s pace between the wes t side of the conduit and the bedrock s urface. Drilling was very difficult due to the presence of an unknown concr ete plug adjacent to the conduit. However , the dr ain was completed, and s eepage f lows were inter cepted near the ups tream limits of the rockfill zone. The discharge pipe from the horizontal drain was extended to the downstream toe of the dam, along with the drainage pipe placed at the bottom of the conduit drainage zone along both the east and west sides of the conduit. Becaus e of the conf ined s paces and ir regular bedr ock s urfaces, the dr ainage and f ilter zones were placed in thin lifts and compacted with hand-operated vibratory compa ction equipment (figure B-79). Although the work wa s time consuming, the uniformly gr aded mater ials were ver y easy to place and compact.

A trans ition zone of s maller rockfill was placed immediately adjacent to the filter before going to general rock fill backfill materials . B-110 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories Lessons learned The designers must be actively involved onsite during the construction phase as the actual subsurface conditions are revealed. Designers should not rely on construction personnel to make critical judgments about the need for field changes \u2014especially wher e filter and dr ain features are involved. The highes t risk to the embankment dam occur red when the excavation was at the maximum extent, and bef ore the new dr ains were installed. The contr actor was required to prepare a contingency plan for mobilization of a horizontal drilling s pecialis t to minimize the time the excavation had to be open to the maximum depth. When it was determined that a horizontal drain would be required, the drilling contractor was mobilized. The drilling contractor was onsite by the time the excavation was completed, r esulting in minimum impact on the duration of the critical phase of the excavation. This type of construction, due to subsurface conditions, is difficult to inves tigate. Since as -built records from that cons truction er a wer e lacking, a high degr ee of uncer tainty was involved. Anticipating f ield changes is required, as well as carrying a higher contingency than might be neces sary for above-ground construction. Any evidence of slime bacteria deposits should be addressed as a potentially serious problem for filter and drain features.

B-111 Conduits through Embankment Dams Proje ct name: Willow Creek Dam Location: Montana Summary: Lining of an existing outlet works conduit using CIPP Willow Creek Dam is located in wes tern Montana. The 84-foot high embankment dam impounds a reservoir of 32,300 acre-feet, used primarily for irrigation. The outlet works consists of a 54-inch diameter concrete-lined tunnel through the right abutment, with gua rd and regula ting ga tes provided within a gate sha ft upstrea m of the dam axis . The embankment dam and outlet wor ks were originally cons tructed between 1907 and 1911, and wer e modif ied in 1917 and 1941. The Bureau of Reclamation owns the embankment dam, and the Greenfields Irrigation District operates it. A large s inkhole was discovered on the cres t of the embankment dam in June 1996. The sinkhole was located dir ectly above the outlet wor ks tunnel, about 50 f eet downs tream from the gate shaft and near the dam axis . Earth materials were found to be er oding per iodically f rom a 1- inch weep hole in the tunnel s idewall. Four weep holes in the tunnel lining were s ealed, and the s inkhole was temporarily s tabilized by backfilling with s and and gravel materials . The reservoir was gradually lowered us ing the outlet wor ks, for a total dr awdown of 27 feet. Excavation of the embankment dam revealed the sinkhole extended through 40 feet of bedrock to a large cavity surrounding the concrete tunnel lining. Tremie grout was used to fill the voids around the tunnel, followed by the placement of backfill concr ete to the excavated bedr ock s urface at elevation. The embankment dam was restored by the placement of a filter blanket on the excavated f oundation, f ollowed by the placement of compacted glacial till materials to dam cres t elevation, and replacement of the slope protection on the downstream face. The outlet works tunnel was originally excavated in 1907 by hand-drilling and blasting, with cons iderable water and s oft mater ials encounter ed. Heavy timber beams and posts with timber lagging were used to support the tunnel excavation throughout its length, resulting in a square, excavated opening for the circular tunnel lining. Although it is unclear how the concrete tunnel lining was actually constructed, the s pecifications called f or a unif orm concr ete thicknes s of 8 inches , without reinforcing bars , and the placement of \"puddled fill\" outs ide the tunnel lining to the excavated s urface. Such cons truction could have r esulted in a significant quantity of fine grained backfill material along the outlet works tunnel. B-112 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories The downs tream tunnel lining was severely damaged in 1958, when maximum outlet releas es of 550 ft3/s were reported. Appr oximately 70 f eet of unreinforced concr ete in the tunnel invert was removed by the flow, beginning 10 feet downstream from the regulating gate, and the f oundation r ock was eroded to a depth of 3 feet. A 10- to 15-foot long section of the tunnel crown was also removed, revealing a large void surrounding the tunnel. The structural damage is believed to have been initiated by negative pres sures resulting from an ins ufficient air s upply to the downstream tunnel during maximum releases, due to an undersized, 6-inch diameter air vent pipe. Repairs included replacement of the missing concrete invert and crown, and placement of rubble fill outs ide the tunnel lining. Weep holes were later drilled in the tunnel lining for pres sure relief. The development of the large tunnel cavity was probably a combination of overexcavation during cons truction, gradual eros ion of the puddled fill and s oft bedrock materials, and collapse of the harder bedrock materials into the tunnel following the lining failure. The sinkhole may have developed gradually by the internal eros ion of glacial till embankment materials through open joints and fractures in the bedrock, progressive collapse or \"stoping\" of the bedrock into the void below, and er osion of earth mater ials through open cr acks and weep holes in the tunnel lining. Continued concern for the long term s tability and s tructural integrity of the downs tream tunnel lining, and the potential f or renewed er osion of earth mater ials through open cracks and joints (despite grouting efforts) resulted in the consideration of tunnel lining options. The downstream tunnel extends 429 feet from the r egulating gate to the downs tream por tal, wher e outlet r eleases enter a diffus ion-type s tilling bas in. A structural lining was required for the firs t 100 feet of tunnel, which s eemed to be the mos t susceptible to f uture problems , since it included the portion damaged in 1958, the sinkhole location, a significant longitudinal crack along the crown, and continuing seepage from various other open cracks and joints , and was located dir ectly below the wide embankment dam cr est. The configuration of the s tilling bas in at the downs tream portal, and grade changes within the tunnel (including one of over 3 degrees), made the proposed installation of a rigid structural lining more difficult. So the search for alternatives to rigid linings focus ed on CIPP s ystems, originally introduced in the United States by Insituform Technologies in 1977. A CIPP lining consists of a flexible, resin- impregnated, needled polyester felt tube, which is expanded under hydrostatic head, and cured by the circulation of heated water. Construction access through the outlet works gate s haft, for ins tallation of a CIPP lining from the ups tream end of the tunnel, would have been s everely affected by the gate hous e and exis ting mechanical equipment, including the gate operator and stem, air vent pipe, ladders, and landings. Installation of a CIPP lining by the inversion method from the downstream portal would have r esulted in the expos ure of the entir e unreinforced concr ete lining to B-113 Conduits through Embankment Dams high water temper atures, and the r equirement of an additional 329 f eet of waste tube mater ial. A finite element analys is of potential ther mal s tresses within the 8- inch concrete lining, us ing an AB AQUS computer program, predicted large tens ile stresses sufficient to pr oduce extens ive cr acking, which was unacceptable. Use of an alternative low temper ature resin, with a cur ing temper ature of only 80 \u00b0F , would avoid ther mal s tresses and pr oduce acceptable r esults, but would r equire special handling and a longer curing period. Reclamation prepared des ign specifications for a partial tunnel lining us ing CIPP and issued them in M ay 1997. A cons truction contr act was awar ded to the low bidder , Western Slope Utilities , Inc. (WSU) of B reckenridge, Colorado, in July 1997. An InLinerUSA ee, exper ienced in the pulled- in-place ins tallation method for linings up to 36 inches in diameter, and obtained the services of an InLinerUSA representative with the r equired exper ience f or large diameter linings . For design purposes, the existing tunnel was assumed to be in a \"fully deteriorated\" condition (due to the longitudinal crack in the crown) and subject to internal pressure under maximum discharge conditions. Design loads included a 10-foot external fill height on the tunnel crown, a 10-foot external hydros tatic head on the tunnel invert, and a maximum internal pressure of 20 lb/in2. The CIPP was designed to carry the external loads with no contributing support from the circular tunnel lining with a factor of safety of 2.0. An ovality reduction factor, based on the average minimum and maximum diameter s of the tunnel lining, was included to properly es timate the s tiffnes s of the elliptically deflected pipe. For internal loads , the CIPP was designed as a thin-walled cylinder with uniform pipe wall s tresses, using a hoop stress equation for plastic pipe. An epoxy vinyl es ter resin was selected over a polyes ter resin for greater strength and longevity. Design properties for the res in included an initial flexural modulus of 300,000 lb/in2 and an initial flexural s trength of 5,000 lb/in2 for external loads , and an initial tens ile strength of 3,000 lb/in2 for internal loads . To char acterize the long term performance of the CI PP over the minimum 50- year design lif e, a 33- percent creep r eduction was assumed f or the f lexural modulus and f lexural strength, and a 50-percent hydrosta tic stress regression w as assume d for the tensile strength. The final des ign thicknes s for the CI PP was 1.06 inches , including an additional 5 per cent thicknes s to provide s ufficient res in to fill the interior felt of the calibration hos e, which was to remain in place. The contractor began mobilizing equipment at the embankment dam on Augus t 8, 1997. A steel platf orm was installed 12 f eet above the bottom of the r egulating gate shaft, and a s teel elbow s ection was center ed within the ups tream end of the tunnel, to support a short flexible hose for a water column. One end of a 110-foot long calibration hose, consisting of a single layer of felt fabric with a watertight polyur ethane coating, was carefully lower ed down the haft and thr ough the f lexible B-114 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories hose and elbow, wher e it was turned ins ide out and s ecurely fastened to the outs ide of the elbow. A winch and r oller were set up at the gate hous e door way, and a second roller was positioned at the bottom of the shaft. The tunnel surfaces were swept clean, and utility lines (for lighting, ventilation, and water circulation) were established within the sha ft. The resin-filled tube was delivered to the s ite on Augus t 11 in a refrigerated truck (figure B-80). The nonwoven fabric tube was manufactured in Houston, Texas at InLinerUSA headquarters, and the resin was added in Alma, Colorado at a \"wet-out\" plant us ed by WSU. Total weight of the liner was 10,000 pounds . The liner was removed f rom the r efrigerated tr uck us ing a tr uck-mounted winch, and was carefully fed into the tunnel at the downs tream portal and s lowly pulled ups tream. The liner was pulled into final position in the tunnel within about 1.5 hours and was securely fastened to the s teel elbow outs ide the calibr ation hos e. Reservoir water from the upstrea m gate sha ft was pumped into the wa ter column to begin inversion of the calibration hose under a 1-foot head. Within 20 minutes, the calibration hose had been tur ned ins ide out and extended the f ull length of the liner , pressing the liner tightly against the tunnel surface. Two perforated water supply hoses inside the calibr ation hos e wer e used to cir culate heated water from a heat exchanger truck under the full 12-foot head. Retur n water temper atures at the tr uck r eached 135 \u00b0F in 2 hour s and wer e held constant f or 4 hour s, and then wer e raised to 175 \u00b0F within 1 hour and wer e held consta nt for 6 hours for c uring the resin. After curing was comple ted, the circulating water was gradually cooled to 100 \u00b0F in 4 hours, finishing by noon on August 12. Epoxy vinyl ester resin contains styrene, a possible carcinogen, which is released during the cur ing pr ocess. Styr ene vapor s are heavier than air , and potentially flammable and explosive. Installers and inspectors must follow OSHA regulations pertaining to workers in hazardous and confined spaces. Fresh air had to be introduced into the tunnel bef ore the contr actor could cut a s mall hole in the end of the har dened liner to release the water . The was te water was fully contained within the downs tream s tilling bas in to permit final cooling to 70 \u00b0F, removal of resin residue from the water surface, and dissipation of di ssolved styrene. Both ends of the liner were trimmed us ing chain s aws and cir cular saws, and a 0.5-inch deep groove was provided around the periphery to accommodate installation of end s eals. Amex 10/WEKO s eals were used, each cons isting of a 14.5-inch wide rubber seal with three stainless steel bands spread by a hydraulic expanding device to ens ure a tight f it. The wor k was completed on Augus t 15, one week af ter site mobilization, f or a total cos t of about $145,000. Subsequent laboratory tests on field samples confirmed the design parameters for tensile and flexural properties.

The CIPP installation has been performing satisfactorily since completion of construction. Lessons learned CIPP can be used for conduit renovation. Use of CIPP can be applicable to conduits with changes in invert slope. CIPP provides a conduit lining with minor loss of flow cross-sectional area.

Arthur C asagrande (1950) also discussed this case history . Lake Wis ter is located in the San B ois Mountains on the Poteau River in far eas tern Oklahoma. The Tulsa Dis trict Cor ps of Engineer s designed and built the pr oject. Construction began in April 1946, and the project was placed in full flood control operation in December 1949. The embankment dam is a rolled, imper vious earthfill with r ock-protected s lopes. The embankment dam was cons tructed as a homogeneous clay fill without a chimney filter. At the time the embankment dam was cons tructed, chimney f ilters were not a s tandar d design element in major dams as they ar e now. The embankment dam is 5,700 f eet long and r ises to a maximum height of 99 feet above the streambed. Later tests on soils from the embankment dam conclus ively demons trated that the clays were highly dis persive. The bedr ock in the ar ea is Pennsylvanian age s hale known to commonly pr oduce r esidual s oils with dispersive prope rties. Heavy rains caus ed the res ervoir to fill quickly beginning in January 1949. When water had risen to a height of about 60 feet, muddy water was seen discharging on the downstream slope of the embankment dam. The quantity of flow was initially estimated at 2,200 gal/min, and it increased to about 8,000-9,000 gal/min in the next several days . The spillway radial gates were opened, and within 3 days , the res ervoir had dropped about 13 feet. This exposed tunnels on the upstream slope, through which the water was enter ing the embankment dam. The tunnels were about 2 f eet in diameter and extended along the ups tream face of the embankment dam f or a distance of about 300 f eet, at about the s ame elevation on the s lope. Dye was injected into a vor tex on the ups tream slope, and the tes t showed the water was flowing along a nearly horizontal seam in the embankment dam for a distance of about 740 feet, with a head on the tunnel at the time flow began of only about 13 feet (a gr adient of a little over 50:1). The dye tes ts showed the time f or flow to travel this distance was less than 13 minutes, a velocity of about 1 foot per second. Figure B-81 below s hows an idealized s ketch of the embankment cr oss section with the flow path caus ing the er osion identif ied. After the reservoir level had dropped farther, the erosion tunnels exposed were excavated and plugged, and s everal remedial meas ures were implemented, including B-117 2 2 1 1El. 485' 2.75 1 5 1 Probable path of main leaks.

After completion of the remedial work, the embankment dam has been in operation continuously with little trouble. A major renovation program was finished in 1990. The renovation included a s lurry panel wall ins talled for the full height of the embankment. Sherard concluded that the caus e of the leakage path in the embankment dam could only be attributed to hydraulic fracture in the embankment. The flow path developed immediately above the closure section on the embankment dam, also just above the old s tream channel. Aggr avating this condition was the f act that the r ight bank of the s tream channel (viewed downs tream) cons isted of a bedr ock s helf that contributed to differential settlement. A plan view of the area of the leak is shown in figure B-82. A longitudinal profile of the area where the leak developed is shown as figure B -83. Note that this view is looking ups tream. The embankment dam was compacted to a relatively high dry density corresponding to about 97 percent of the maximum Standard Proctor dry density, and it was compacted at about optimum water content. The soils were silty, r elatively low in plasticity, and highly dispersive. Compaction at these conditions probably resulted in a somewhat brittle fill likely to crack when s ubjected to differential s ettlement. Lessons learned The incident demonstrated that even well constructed embankment dams built by what was then state-of-the-art technology are susceptible to hydraulic fracture and internal erosion if they ar e not pr otected by inter nal chimney f ilters. Modern embankment dam des ign concepts include pr otective f ilters for all significant and high hazard embankment dams, and even low hazard dams if constructed of B-118 Appendix B \u2014Case Histories A A Dow nstream toe Upst ream toe Poteau Ri ver Direction of major leaks Figure B-82 .\u2014Pla n View of Wi ster Dam showing flow path for internal erosion tunnels i n fill.
