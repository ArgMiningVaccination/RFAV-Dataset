In Western diet, foods are evaluated for proteins, calories, carbohydrates, vitamins, and other nutritional contents. However in Chinese diet (and that includes herbs), one looks for not only vitamins and minerals but also the energetic properties of food like energy, flavor and movement. Other less importance aspects include meridian tropism and common and organic actions. These refer to specific internal [organs](http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/whatyinyangorgans.html) or the [meridians](http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/whatmeridian.html) on which the foods can act. For example, celery acts on the [stomach](http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/stomachsixyangorgans.html) and [lungs](http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/lungsfiveyinorgans.html), carrot on the [lungs](http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/lungsfiveyinorgans.html) and [spleen](http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/spleenfiveyinorgans.html). According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), foods are just as herbs that can be selected and prepared appropriately to tonify, cleanse and regulate the body. |1.||The five energies of foods| Here are some food samples with different energies.

Cooling the Summer with Food: An Introduction to Medicinal Foods by Yanfang Wang, M.D., Ph.D. Yin-Yang Balance and Food Choice Whether you turn to acupuncture or allopathic medicine for healing, choosing the right foods for your constitution will speed your progress. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), health is a state of balance in which food choice is key. As a longtime nutritionist I can report profound positive changes when people get their food selections right. Nutritional balance from a TCM perspective is far different from that of Western nutrition. Modern nutrition science is based on knowing the chemical composition of foods and the biochemical pathways of the body. Western nutritionists quantify nutrients such as protein, carbohydrates, and fat, then group foods accordingly, with a one-size-fits-all serving recommendation. The Food Pyramid, for example, groups bread, pasta, grains, and potatoes together as \"carbohydrates\" and suggests 5 to 8 servings. According to TCM, however, bread and pasta are damp and cooling, and thus are not recommended for someone overweight, bloated, or suffering sinus congestion. Sprouted grains, rye, and wild rice, although also carbohydrates, do not contribute to dampness because they have energetic properties different from flour and can actually be helpful for people with such yin conditions. Understanding Yin and Yang Foods According to Eastern traditions the forces of yin and yang are energetic qualities that shape everything in the universe, including our health. The Chinese symbol for yin is the shady side of a hill, while the symbol for yang is the sunny side. Thus yin qualities include coolness, dampness, and darkness, relative to the yang qualities of warmth, dryness, and light. Winter is yin, while summer is yang, and night is yin while day is yang. Arthritis made worse by cold weather is a yin condition. A red, inflamed rash brought on by heat is a yang condition. A ruddy-faced, irritable man with high blood pressure is relatively yang. An anemic, melancholy woman is relatively yin. Yin foods tend to be cooling and/or moistening for the body. Yang foods tend to be warming and drying. This has less to do with the actual temperature or moisture of the food and more to do with its \"energetics.\" Boiled spinach for example, is cooling and moistening, as is baked tofu. Chilled wine is warming, as is roast beef. Toast, while dry to touch, actually moistens the body. The effects of such food qualities on health have been observed for thousands of years. Your acupuncturist is trained to balance your body's constitution. By observing your body and understanding the energetics of food, you can make food and activity choices to speed your body's healing progress. Imbalance can come from an excess, or deficiency, of yin or yang. Although more complex than this, the following is an overview of yin and yang patterns of imbalance and the food choices that can help restore balance. Your constitution is ever changing, so be sure you adjust with the seasons and your life situation. Yin Patterns of Imbalance Cold Tendency to feel chilled Urine tends to be clear Dresses warmly, likes heat Tendency toward loose Pale complexion stools Preference for warm food/drinks Slow metabolism drinks Soft, fleshy muscles Rarely thirsty Often tired, sleeps a lot Tendency to feel depressed Health worse in cold pressed weather Quiet, withdrawn A cold pattern often occurs in vegetarians or those who eat primarily raw foods, especially when they live in the cold. Cold can also set in with age and may be combined with dampness. Regular, warming aerobic exercise is essential. Healing food choices include warm lamb or beef dishes, dark poultry, meat-based soups and stews, free-range eggs, eel, trout, and wild salmon. Beneficial vegetables include cooked root veggies, baked winter squash, onions, and mustard greens. Nuts and seeds are warming, as are butter, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and pepper. Helpful grains include oatmeal, quinoa, and buckwheat. Food and drinks are best eaten cooked and warm. Salads, raw fruits, frozen desserts, pasta, white flour, and iced beverages should be minimized. Dampness Strong dislike of humidity Stuffy nose, postnasal drip Health worsens in dampness Mentally \"foggy\" Abdominal bloating Retention of fluids Little thirst or hunger Overweight, soft fat Urine tends to be cloudy Puffy eyes or face Easily short of breath Feeling of heaviness especially in lower body Dampness can be associated with cold or heat and is exacerbated by damp living conditions. Chronic dampness is brought on by eating on the run, excessive worry, or from a diet rich in fried foods, breads, pasta, commercial dairy, ice cream, and other sweets. Too many salads and raw fruits weaken digestion and lead to dampness. Aerobic exercise is essential for balance. Helpful foods include lightly cooked greens including broccoli, turnip greens, asparagus, and kale. Fish and grilled or roasted meats and poultry are balancing. The best grains for a damp pattern are rye, jasmine, and basmati rice as well as sprouted grains. Radishes, turnips, pumpkin seeds, green tea, and bitter foods and herbs help to dry dampness. Sweets, dairy, and starchy foods contribute to dampness. Ice cream, lasagna, white bread, and milk should be avoided. Yang Patterns of Imbalance Heat Tendency to feel warm Tendency to be talkative Uncomfortable in hot weather Urine tends to be dark May suffer fever blisters, canker sores Dresses in short sleeves Tends toward ruddy complexion May suffer headaches, nose bleeds, bleeding High blood pressure gums Often thirsty, craves cold drinks Sleep often restless, disturbing dreams Tendency toward impatience, irritability or anger May be constipated A heat pattern often shows up in hot weather or with stress. Overwork, alcohol, and sugar heat the body. Meditation, walks in nature, swimming, and/or yoga are ideal for balancing the agitated nature of a heat imbalance. Ideal foods are salads, cucumbers, and lightly cooked green leafy vegetables especially spinach and watercress. Vegetables of all kinds are helpful whereas meats should be limited. Other cooling foods include melons, pears, bean dishes, mung beans, sprouts, sushi, non-spicy soups, and lots of water. Alcohol and sugar are best avoided. Mint is a beneficial cooling herb whereas pepper, garlic, ginger, and onions should be reduced. Dryness Dry skin, dandruff Cravings for sweets Dry stools, constipation Preference for warm liquids in small sips Dry throat or eyes Night sweats Menopause Can easily become both hot or cold Thin body type Easily stressed, irritated or frustrated Rosy cheeks, especially after exercise A dry pattern is a deficiency of yin, or fluids. Hormones, skin oils, saliva, digestive juices and secretions provide us our yin element. Fluids are akin to a car's antifreeze; when low you can easily overheat or freeze. We see dryness at menopause, or as we age and skin becomes dry. Although hot flashes feel like heat, they are a sign of diminishing yin, which allows the normal heat of the body to go unchecked. Stress also depletes yin. Remedies include meditation, yoga, walks in nature and gardening. Beneficial fats are critical. Healthful choices include fatty fish, free-range eggs, grass-fed butter, goat and sheep cheeses, olive and coconut oil, dark poultry meat, pork, nuts, and avocado. Soups and stews rich with grass-fed animal fats are very helpful. Other moistening foods include black beans, green beans, Napa cabbage, winter squash, yams, sea vegetables, millet, whole wheat, fermented soy, and shellfish. All types benefit by choosing foods according to the seasons. Summer foods such as salads, cucumbers, and melons are ideal for hot weather. Conversely meats, root vegetables, hot soups, and stews are most nourishing in winter. Pay attention to your body and choose the foods that naturally seem balancing.

To maintain health, the diet should consist of 60% alkaline forming foods and 40% acid forming foods. To restore health, the diet should consist of 80% alkaline forming foods and 20% acid forming foods. This chart is for those trying to \"adjust\" their body pH. The pH scale is from 0 to 14, with numbers below 7 acidic ( low on oxygen ) and numbers above 7 alkaline. An acidic body is a sickness magnet. What you eat and drink will impact where your body's pH level falls. Balance is Key !!! We know, it sounds like it's too good to be true. But there actually are some things you can eat that spike the metabolism, trigger hormones that release fat, and eliminate toxins that make it hard for your body to shed unwanted pounds. Just be cautioned: For these foods to work their miracles, they must be consumed as part of a clean diet. That's right, don't expect to make up for a junk-filled day by noshing on a few fat-burning kale chips. This king of vegetable is not only the most nutrient-dense food on the planet, it also helps suppress the appetite and clears toxins from the body. Four cups of kale (the amount you'd use for a salad) has 10 grams of fiber and enough detoxifying nutrients to super-charge your liver's detoxification pathways for 48 hours! A cleaner body means fewer cravings for sugar and fried food, your fat cells' greatest allies. Easy meal ideas: Assemble a raw kale salad with avocado, yellow peppers, and grape tomatoes; try crunchy kale chips; or sip on a cooling green vegetable juice. Who knew that food could talk to your fat cells? That's exactly what the phytonutrient sulforaphane in broccoli does. It stimulates an enzyme that tells your fat cells to burn fat. Easy meal ideas: Saut\u00e9 broccoli with lemon zest and chili flakes, mix broccoli and sweet Italian sausage together, or toss broccoli and summer squash with olive oil, mint, lemon juice, and pine nuts. The fat in avocado is actually a triple-fat burner. Its monounsaturated fat plumps up cell membranes, enabling cells to better chat with fat-burning hormones. It also switches off the body's fat storage hormones. In addition, it boosts the metabolism by protecting the energy-producing part of cells from free radical damage. Bring on the guacamole! Easy meal ideas: Eat half an avocado with sea salt and tomatoes for an on-the-go breakfast, add avocado to a spinach and green bean salad, or make an avocado smoothie with coconut milk and cinnamon. Next time you want to discard those large nuts from the mixed nut selection, don't. They're actually little fat-burners. They help boost the metabolism by converting the thyroid hormone to its active form. They also bind up toxins that would otherwise store themselves in your fat cells and contribute to cellulite. Easy meal ideas: Snack on Brazil nuts, drink Brazil nut milk with vanilla and cardamom, or sprinkle Brazil nuts on a mango, papaya, and citrus fruit salad. Packed with omega-3 fats, fiber, and protein, these tiny seeds help suppress the appetite, fire up the metabolism, and turn on glucagon, one of the body's fat-burning hormones. The trick is to soak them for 15 minutes so they swell up to 10 times their size. Just as with oatmeal, the larger the seeds are, the quicker your stomach will release those hormones that let you know you're full\u2014and hopefully satisfied. Easy meal ideas: Make a chia seed pudding by soaking them in almond milk and then topping them with raw almonds, blend them with coconut milk and pineapple for a pi\u00f1a colada-inspired dessert, or eat a chia energy bar. While you can't eat your way to a six-pack, you can strip abdominal fat by consuming wild salmon on a regular basis. The omega-3s in wild salmon help improve insulin sensitivity, which shrinks fat from your waistline. Wild salmon also activates the thyroid hormone for a faster metabolism. Easy meal ideas: Poach wild salmon with a watercress and pink grapefruit salad, make a wild salmon ceviche, or eat smoked wild salmon with dill and mustard. Oysters Oysters are your salvation when you're dieting and dining out. In addition to being low in calories\u2014it's only 50 calories for six oysters\u2014they are the richest dietary source of zinc, which helps to decrease the appetite and PMS-induced cravings. Easy meal idea: Eat a few oysters at the raw bar with a squeeze of lemon and a dash of Tabasco. Not all dietary fats are created equal. Coconut oil is rich in medium-chained-triglycerides (MCTs), which your body preferentially uses for energy, leaving less opportunity for them to be stored as fat. This aromatic spice helps move glucose into the cells faster so our fat storage hormone, insulin, hangs around a lot less. But note: Eating a cinnamon bun doesn't count! You need to consume at least a quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon to reap its fat-burning benefits. Easy meal ideas: Add cinnamon to a vanilla smoothie, make an apple-spiced chia pudding, or toss cinnamon through warmed quinoa with raspberries and pistachios. Coffee stimulates adrenaline, which sends a message to your fat stores to burn fat. When you drink coffee 20 minutes before a workout, it also acts as an ergogenic aid enabling you to train more intensely. The key is to make it caffeinated and black, as milk reduces its fat-burning potential. Also, if you drink more than one cup a day, coffee can start to interfere with your body's ability to regulate insulin, its fat storage hormone.
