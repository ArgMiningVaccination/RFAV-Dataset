I sat on my couch and for three days I felt like I could do nothing - I felt numb. Others had swung into community and charitable action - and I saw this, and felt I should be a part - and yet I just felt so emotionally + energetically overwhelmed that I just kept sitting on the couch, feeling paralyzed. I finally got up and took the subway into the city (normally a 30 minute commute that took 2.5 hours), and the energy in those trains and tunnels was so dark, so heavy, that I felt like a zombie when I finally came back up and out of the station. Looking back on that time I was able to see that it was empathic overwhelm - I was so affected by the collective feelings of shock, stress, and anguish that many felt at that time, and the darkness that had come over the city, that my system responded like a blown fuse. It just shut down. Talking about psychic shielding right now is a bit tough for me, because I know so many of you are trying to pull yourselves out (or stay out) of a negative space. At the same time, I also know there's a lot of this going down for many people in our community: I also know that many of you in the service or care industries, whether you're offering massage, yoga, healing sessions, intuitive or psychic readings, social work, therapy, customer care, etc., have not been adequately trained in energetic self-care and shielding techniques to keep you from taking on client or customer energy that's not yours (and that is draining). I know this because I wasn't either - I've had my ass handed to me so many times on this path that I've had to learn everything the hard way. But you don't have to - here are a few things you can do right now to help you feel a bit better: [Clear your energy](https://www.krista-mitchell.com/blog/howtoclearyouraura?rq=selenite). Burn sacred herbs like rosemary, cedar, sage, or resins like copal or frankincense, and waft the smoke around and through your aura. You can also bathe or swim in salt water. For internalized dark energy, hold [satin spar selenite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-selenite-stone.html?sort_view=all) in your receptive hand and [black tourmaline](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-black%20tourmaline%20(schorl)-stone.html?sort_view=all) in your dominant hand for 20 minutes, or hold a piece of [clear quartz](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-clear%20quartz-stone.html?sort_view=all) in your hand and blow the dark energy into the crystal. Clear its energy afterwards. Ground your energy. Sit with a tree, [hold grounding stones](https://www.krista-mitchell.com/blog/groundingcrystals?rq=grounding), imagine a circuit of energy forming between you and the earth that is cycling revitalizing, adaptogenic energy. Center your awareness. Our soul center is a source of power and presence. Allow your awareness to sink down into your body to where you imagine your center or soul to be. Breathe deeply into that space, feel how it draw you into a feeling of strength + sovereignty. Raise your frequency. This helps to uplift your spirits and transcend some of the darker, lower, or harmful frequencies. Exercise, dance to happy music, find ways to laugh out loud, spend time in nature, or hold high frequency crystals like [Congo [sugilite](https://www.krista-mitchell.com/blog/howtoworkwithsugilite?rq=sugilite).

[African Bloodstone](https://www.healingcrystals.com/Tumbled_African_Bloodstone__Africa__-_Tumbled_Stones.html) from Africa, is known Seftonite or Vulcan Jasper. It is a mostly opaque stone with a lighter almost mossy-green / gray color and larger red dots. Sometimes it has inclusions of Pyrite too. Seftonite is the perfect stone for connecting with ancestors and learning their wisdom. Being grounding and protective Seftonite can be used also for dream work to stimulate and recall your dreams. It encourages patience and is calming to those who are easily irritated, agitated or angered. It also helps with emotional growth. If you are struggling to make decisions, Seftonite can support and help with clarity so that you make more flexible decisions. Creativity, intuition, strength and courage are enhanced when working with Seftonite. Seftonite brings balance when we are feeling stressed. Seftonite also re-energizes the mind and body especially for those suffering from burnout. Physically, Seftonite is a wonderful healing stone that boosts the immune system, supports healing infections and detoxification. It purifies and regulates blood flow and is especially beneficial for the heart, stomach, liver, kidneys and spleen. |Read more articles like this in the following categories:| | | "}
