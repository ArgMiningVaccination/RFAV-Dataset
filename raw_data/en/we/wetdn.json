The often colourless look of winter is fading and spring is beginning to show its face. Even though winter throughout the province was not that harsh, our yearning for warmer weather, green grass and fragrant flowers is pronounced this time of year. T o jump start my own spring, recently, I cut some forsythia branches from the bushes in my garden. I took them to the office, put them in continued on page 3\u0018 Giving Nova Scotia's Seniors a Voice The secretariat newsletter is published four times a year by the Seniors' Secretariat and distributed free of charge. We welcome letters, articles, and items of interest from you. Please include your name, address, and telephone number on all correspondence. The Seniors' Secretariat was established in 1980 to facilitate the planning and development of services and programs for seniors by coordinating plans, policies, and programs presented by the departments of the provincial government. The secretariat serves as a one-door entry to government for seniors, seniors' groups, and other provincial bodies concerned with aging issues. The secretariat develops plans, policies, and programs in partnership with other levels of government and agencies responsible for seniors.

At first, the branches looked more like dead sticks poking out of the water, but I remained patient and, as time went on, I began to see a little new growth. One day I noticed the tiniest buds, then just last week, those seemingly dead twigs were covered in the most brilliant shade of yellow blossoms. I notice how the vivid blossoms bring smiles to the faces of everyone in our office. Those tiny yellow flowers remind us that spring has arrived. As the days grow longer and the weather warms, I urge you to make the time to tend to your own gardens. While many of us see gardening as a hobby, it is also suggested by some that the cultivation of a garden offers a simple way of harnessing the healing power of nature. Gardens and gardening activity may offer a key site of comfort and a vital opportunity for an individual's emotional, physical and spiritual renewal. At the Seniors' Secretariat we are engaged in some \"gardening\" of our own as we cultivate the seeds planted by the Strategy for Positive Aging. With the goals and actions identified in the Strategy as our focus, we continue to work with individuals, communities, business, nonprofit organizations and government to advance the priorities expressed by seniors throughout the province. Planning is well underway for this year's 50+ Expo to be held June 8 and 9. This year's Expo is Western Swingin' and Country Singin' , so dust off your boots and practice your line dancing. There are lots of interesting presenters and entertainment scheduled for both days, including our 5th annual Star Search.During Seniors' week in June, we are preparing to launch the Elder Abuse Awareness and Prevention campaign, beginning with the topic of financial abuse. During a round table session held at the Westin in Halifax in March, a number of invited community stakeholders shared their visions and aspirations for combating financial elder abuse. The Secretariat will continue to coordinate the efforts of these groups, bringing the issue of elder financial abuse into the light. This year's Programs for Seniors is now available at local pharmacies in the province. T o have a copy delivered directly to you, contact us by phone, 1 (800) 670-0065 , or email, scs@gov.ns.ca . On behalf of everyone at the Seniors' Secretariat, I send out our sincere wishes that your spring be full of hope and happiness. \u0018 SECRETARIAT NEWS Preventing Abuse in Facilities: Promoting Respect and Dignity There has been a lot of attention in the news recently about abuse within long-term care facilities. Some people may wonder whether incidents of abuse within institutions are isolated events or are part of a broader phenomenon. Based on available information, we know that between 4% and 10% of older adults will experience abuse or neglect at some point in their later years. This means that, in Nova Scotia, between 5,000 and 13,000 older people experience abuse. These numbers are considered to be very low due to severe under-reporting and generally represent abuse that occurs in community dwellings. We have virtually no information available that tells us how common abuse is within institutional settings, such as nursing homes. Studies done in the eighties and nineties report on how many care workers reported witnessing abuse. For example, in a study done in Ontario in the 1990s, 20% of the nursing staff reported witnessing abuse of nursing home residents. An American study done in the late 1980s reported that 36% of staff had witnessed physical abuse, 21% had witnessed excessive use of restraints, and an alarming 81% of staff witnessed psychological abuse. More current research is needed to fully understand the extent to which abuse happens within institutional settings. There are many factors that contribute to abuse. Ageism, or negative attitudes about aging and older people, is one of the key root causes of all elder abuse. In the case of long-term care facilities, there is a great and valid concern for staffing levels and general working conditions that create stress for the care providers working within them. While environmental stresses such as these may be contributing factors, they do not explain nor excuse abusive actions. All staff and volunteers working in these facilities have a responsibility to ensure that clients are treated with respect and dignity, live free from harm, and do not experience abuse. Working in long-term care requires great patience, professionalism, creativity, and empathy for the people who live there. Attitudes people have about aging, older people, and people who are dependent will affect the way they interact with and treat those people. In addition to broader system-wide supports such as adequate staffing levels and positive working conditions, organizations need to foster an environment in which reporting of abuse is not only accepted but required. This kind of environment is created through clear policies and procedures, consistent and fair application of them, education and training, support, as well as discussing issues of abuse openly and regularly such as at staff meetings. All of these things will facilitate disclosure, information sharing, and learning among all staff and volunteers, family members and residents. Only when people feel free to talk about abuse will we be able to learn from it and prevent it effectively. All long-term care facilities should have effective abuse prevention programs that include training and education on things like: signs and symptoms of abuse, practices and strategies to prevent abuse, appropriate resident care, having empathy for residents, and communication skills. They also include self-reflection on attitudes \u0018 toward aging and/or dependency, problem- solving strategies, and how to foster a respectful environment. Training increases awareness, builds skills, and promotes greater empathy toward residents. An investment in training and education is essential to create environments where care providers have the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to meaningfully care for residents and to promote respect.

A national brainstorming session to gather Canadians' ideas for celebrating the 150th anniversary of Confederation. Background A number of events were held in 1967 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Confederation, including Expo '67 in Montreal. In 1992, when we celebrated the 125th anniversary, a series of events were held in the capital and across Canada. Canada's 150th anniversary will be another key moment in our history, and huge celebrations across the country are called for. Who can participate? All Canadians, young and old, are invited to take part in Celebrate 150. So send us your ideas! How do I participate? Go to the Ideas Section on the web site and enter your suggestion in 1,000 words or less. What will become of my suggestion? All valid suggestions will be put together in a report that will be presented in the House of Commons just before July 1, 2007, ten years before the 150th anniversary. Creative and original ideas will help inspire those in charge of the celebrations! An official report will be given to the people responsible for overseeing the anniversary. \u0018 Don't miss the deadline! Y ou can submit your ideas at www.celebrate150.ca until April 30, 2007.

Seniors Literacy Update Seniors' Literacy Programs 2007 I am happy to report that seniors will once more be able to improve their reading and writing skills while increasing their self-confidence. The Department of Education and the Seniors' Secretariat recently approved funding for six Community Learning Networks and partner Seniors' Councils to offer literacy programs for seniors.The last two rounds of seniors' programs proved to be successful and participants asked for more. If the following feedback is any indication, the 2007 programs should be just as popular. Here are some participant comments: \"It was wonderful to be part of this group.\" \"I always thought I could write. The group gave me the impetus to get started.\" \"I enjoyed it very much.\" \"I learned a lot about healthy food choices and the importance of exercising.\" \"I improved my writing skills.\" \"I learned to speak in a group.\" \"It was nice to meet people and socialize.\" With the exception of one program, the emphasis will be on health literacy covering topics such as active living, healthy eating, food safety, practicing prevention, dealing with your medical provider, understanding food labels, reading medication labels, etc. The seniors' literacy programs are free of charge and will begin soon.

Mr. Flaherty says the option is still on the table for the budget, expected March 20, despite media reports that he had decided not to pursue it. \"Joint filing is one of the items that is on the table,\" Mr. Flaherty told he Canadian Press in an interview from Rome. \"We've already agreed and announced that we'll go ahead with joint filing for pensioners and seniors with respect to pension income. Whether we go further than that will depend on the choices that we make as we get closer to budget day. I certainly want to see how the economy is doing and how our revenues are doing. I'll see that better later in February when we see the most recent figures.\" Last week, a government official said it's \"highly unlikely\" income-splitting will be in the budget, adding it's nowhere near the top of the priority list. The measure would allow couples to file their tax returns jointly, letting a higher- earning spouse off-load part of their income to a partner and potentially save thousands in taxes. But it could cost the government more than $5 billion by some estimates. The Conservatives had considered including the measure in their last election platform but opted against it, largely because of the price tag. Mr. Flaherty said the three Es - environment, economy, and education - will remain the government's top priorities for the budget. \"We're going to be balanced and take into consideration Canada's role as an energy consumer and energy producer. We're an emerging energy superpower \u0018 in the world and we're going to make sure on the environmental side that we're going to act in a constructive way looking at the long term and not just the moment and making sure that we preserve jobs in Canada. \" He said the government is considering initiatives to encourage energy conservation, but no decisions have been made. \"I think it's reasonable to assume that we're going to keeping with environmental initiatives. We're having further discussions with the oil-and-gas industry. We're having a further meeting with the automotive CEOs in T oronto next Friday, which will be our third meeting.\" Mr. Flaherty said the government has to carefully balance tax cuts with environmental spending, saying taxes are too high in Canada. \"This requires prudence in what we do and we're being careful to maintain those principles. But we are in surplus and we're carefully managing spending this year, so I'm comfortable with where we are.\" The government agreed last fall to allow income-splitting for pensioners, partly to take the sting out of its unpopular move to tax income trusts. The Canadian T axpayers Federation calculates that a single-income family with a $100,000 earner would save $4,320 this year under a split-income scheme that would allow each spouse to declare $50,000. By way of comparison, a family with one $75,000 earner and a $25,000 earner would save $1,000 if they split their declared income. A federal study says the move would benefit more than 1.4 million Canadian families - over two-thirds of them with income above $90,000. Kathy Moggridge Human Resources and Social Development kathy.moggridge@servicecanada.gc.ca (902) 426-6089New Rules for Charitable Donations Retirees are among the most generous people in Canada when it comes to making charitable donations, but it's best to plan your giving to maximize the tax benefits. And some new rules introduced this past summer make certain types of donations more attractive than ever before. Any charitable donations you make in a given year are credited at the bottom marginal rate-about 20%, depending on the province. Any additional amounts, however, are credited at the top marginal rate, up to 50%, depending on your province. As a result, while the generally recommended strategy would be to contribute before each year- end to get the tax breaks as soon as possible, you may want to hold off claiming your credit and claim two or more years' donations in a single year instead. That way, you increase the amount eligible for the higher credit rate. Y ou can carry charitable donation credits forward as long as five years. This is particularly beneficial if you are in the habit of donating relatively small amounts-under $1,000 or so. Say, for example, that you are in the habit of giving $500 a year to charity. Each year you would get a tax credit equal to about $40 on the first $200, and as much as $150 on the remaining $300, for a total credit of $190 each year. Now, say you were to give $1,000 every other year instead. Y ou would get the same $40 on the first $200, and up to $400 on the remainder, for a total of $440 over two years. That's $60 more than if you got those credits of $190 each year (2 x $190 = $380). As for that rule change, in the past you were allowed to give investments directly to charity, rather than selling them and then giving cash. Y ou still had to pay capital gains tax on this \"deemed \u0018 disposition, \" but at only half the normal rate. Since only half of your capital gains are normally taxable anyway, you would have to include only one- quarter of the gain in your income for the year. So if, for example, you gave securities that had grown in value by $1,000 arid your marginal tax rate were in the 30% range, you normally would pay $150 in tax (30% of $500); if you gave the securities to charity instead, you'd have had to pay only $75. Under new rules introduced this past summer, however, if you give securities as a gift to charity, you don't have to pay any tax at all on the gain. This strategy can be a very cost - as well as tax - effective way to donate. \"This rule doesn't apply just to stocks, \" says Warren Baldwin, vice-president of T.E. Wealth in T oronto. \"It also applies to mutual fund units, or just about anything that attracts capital gains tax. It's a wonderful way to give, but if you intend to do this, you should get on it right away. \" \"For starters, \" Baldwin explains, \"you need some time to figure out exactly what you're going to give. Y ou have to contact the charity and get the necessary documentation in order, and the transfer itself can take a few days. So don't wait until the last minute, or you might miss the year-end. \" As for what you should give, Baldwin advises that you give whatever assets have accrued the largest gain. \"Y ou might have some U.S. or foreign mutual funds that have gone up a little bit, and some Canadian funds that have gone up a lot. So give the Canadian funds, because that will give you the biggest tax savings.\" Finally, if you've blown all your cash on Christmas, don't fret; you can still donate by charging it on your credit card. Provided you payoff the loan within the grace period-typically 20 to 30 days-you won't have to pay any interest charges. Source: Good Times, December 2006Six Things to Know About Planned Giving So you have a cause you're passionate about and you'd like to write a big cheque to support the charity. The paradox is you're asset-rich, but cash-poor. An alternative is planned giving, where you can bequest funds or assets to a charity payable or transferable upon death. Here's what to keep in mind. Y ou can give money, a cottage, a building, securities, an art collection or other assets. Y our estate will derive a tax credit that can be hedged against a potential capital gains liability on other assets. With life insurance policies, the charity not only receives all the proceeds at the time of your death but also the benefits cannot be contested, taxed or claimed by your creditors. In certain circumstances, the charity can borrow on the policy while you are still alive, and sometimes the charity will pay the premiums. Estate battles can be nasty, so make sure family members are brought into the process. Make sure any conditions you set harmonize with the charity's gift acceptance policy.

This service is accessible to all; this article will provide valuable information that they have shared with me about the role and mandate of the Ombudsman office. The mission of the Ombudsman office is stated as, \"fostering confidence in the pubic service by promoting the principles of fairness, integrity, and good governance.\" The purpose of the Ombudsman office is to assist individuals who feel they have been treated unfairly and, when warranted, to recommend improvements in the delivery of government services. The role of the Ombudsman is to ensure that policies and procedures are being followed and are consistent and fair. They provide all parties with an opportunity to be heard, and treat all individuals fairly, with dignity, respect, and courtesy. The Ombudsman office can investigate concerns about provincial or municipal government services. These concerns may include the manner in which programs and services are delivered, fairness and accountability issues, licences and permits, and treatment of offenders. The office of the Ombudsman cannot investigate concerns outside their jurisdiction, although they may offer referrals to other agencies that may be able to assist. Some issues that the Ombudsman office cannot investigate include, federal government departments or agencies, private individuals and corporations, decisions of Cabinet, decisions of courts or judges, a solicitor or prosecuting officer acting for the Crown, decisions of elected provincial or municipal officers or matters covered by a legislated avenue of appeal. When do you call the Ombudsman office? If you have tried unsuccessfully to resolve your concern with the provincial or municipal government you are dealing with, you can contact the Ombudsman office and they will assess your situation. The Ombudsman office also recognizes the rights of children and youth and has established a specialized child and youth mandate. Seniors' services Seniors are the fastest growing population in Nova Scotia, according to a 2003 statistical profile prepared by the Nova Scotia Seniors' Secretariat. Nova Scotia already has the oldest population in Atlantic Canada and the third oldest in all of Canada. That population is expected to double by the year 2026. The office of the Ombudsman recognizes how these changing demographics will affect the development of policies, programs, and services within the province. In keeping with these changes in demographics, the Ombudsman office is developing a Seniors' Service Initiative designed to give a stronger presence with seniors in residential care facilities, nursing homes, and homes for the aged. The primary responsibility for seniors in care facilities rests with the Nova Scotia Department of Health. Through this initiative, the Ombudsman office hopes to increase the comfort and confidence of residents in care, as well as assist all seniors in navigating government processes by visiting facilities and maintaining open lines of communication with the Department of Health. The overall goal 11 of the Ombudsman office is to improve the delivery of government services. The office of the Ombudsman is committed to Nova Scotians in providing an independent, impartial, and unbiased investigation into complaints against provincial and municipal government departments, agencies, boards and commissions. This is a valuable service that can assist you, if needed, to resolve many concerns in an expedient process of administrative review. Get to know your Ombudsman's office in your community. They are there to help. Nova Scotians can contact the office of the Ombudsman at ombudsman@gov.ns.ca or visit their web site at www.gov.ns.ca/ombu/ or call toll free within Nova Scotia at 1 (800) 670-1111 . Source: Stride: Promoting Excellence in Seniors CarePOSITIVE LIVING Supporting a Worthy Cause Okay everyone, let's pat ourselves on the back. We're quite a generous lot. Most of us have a favourite charity for which we are willing to fork out money and spend some of our time. In fact, a significant 45% of us over the age of 15 donate time to support charities and other nonprofit organizations, according to Statistics Canada. For some of us, generosity involves giving donations, making regular payroll contributions, or purchasing products such as Girl Guide cookies. Others put in countless unpaid hours sitting on not-for-profit boards and committees. Organizing and working at various special events or running thrift or gift shops are other ways in which many of us help. Statistics Canada data from the \"Canada survey of giving, volunteering and participating\" shows that in 2004, Canadians contributed almost two billion charitable hours - the equivalent of one million full-time jobs. More recent data from the agency, as reported on CBC News, shows that nearly six million Canadians dug into their pockets in 2005, donating a record $7.9 billion to charities, up $1 billion over the year before. In fact, total donations increased by 13.8% last year over 2004, with boosts in generosity from people in almost every province and territory. Youthful exuberance Over the last 10 years, volunteering among 15- to 24-year olds has also increased substantially. In fact, almost one out of every Disappointments should be cremated, not embalmed. - Henry HaskinsI'm very pleased with each advancing year. It stems back to when I was forty. I was a bit upset about reaching that milestone, but an older friend consoled me. \"Don't complain about growing old - many, many people do not have that privilege.\" - Earl Warren 1\u0018 five volunteers is a young Canadian. And, on average, each one contributes almost 125 hours every year. Motivation varies from person to person, but more than nine out of 10 of us are willing to contribute to our communities. Almost eight out of 10 volunteer to use our skills and experience for the good of others. And six out of 10 get involved because we're personally affected by or familiar with the organization's cause. Healthy benefits Regardless of our motivation or the amount of time or money we give, it's great to know that giving benefits not only the charities we support but also our own health. A landmark Ontario study, Volunteer for the Health of It , points out that volunteering reduces the impact of stress on the body, lowers blood pressure and even bolsters the immune system. And according to the Public Health Agency of Canada, volunteering has been linked to lower mortality rates in older adults. A perfect prescription Dr. Mark J. Y affe with the Department of Family Medicine at McGill University suggests that volunteering appears to give people new meaning to life. It helps to reduce anxiety and depression, and increases life satisfaction. He believes that giving ourselves to a cause improves personal self-regard, reduces self-concern and increases mental health. \"Volunteering may produce a win-win situation,\" Dr. Y affe reports to the Canadian Health Network. \"Society benefits, and the person volunteering may also personally benefit. What a perfect prescription for health!\" The benefits of volunteering truly are reciprocal. So next time you're asked to help out, remember that giving means not only helping others but also helping yourself. Caroline Tapp-McDougall Publisher Source: Rehab & Community Care Medicine Winter 2006, Vol. 15, No. 4 Too Old for the Road Is there a right age to quit driving? With people over the age of 65 now the fastest growing segment of Canada's population, there are more seniors driving than ever before. Y et this age group has one of the highest motor vehicle crash rates per kilometre driven, which begs the question: How old is too old to drive? It turns out that health-not age-is the critical factor in determining when a driver should hang up the car keys. \"The issue is not age, but diseases and functional disabilities that often come with age, and that can affect a person's physical and cognitive performance behind the wheel,\" explains Dr. Gary Naglie, a T oronto rehab clinical researcher who holds the Mary Trimmer Chair in Geriatric Medicine at the University of T oronto. Conditions affect ability Some diseases and health conditions can affect a person's reflexes, coordination and other abilities necessary for the safe operation of a vehicle. These health conditions can include visual impairment, seizures, fainting spells, diabetes, arthritis, sleep apnea, heart conditions, stroke or 1\u0018 brain injury, Alzheimer disease and other dementing illnesses, psychiatric conditions, and Parkinson's and similar diseases, according to Can DRIVE, a national research program dedicated to improving the safety of older drivers. When seniors can no longer drive due to health reasons, it often has a huge impact on their lives. Many people rely on their cars to shop, run errands and socialize, especially when they may be less physically able to get around without a car. People who live in rural areas face even bigger challenges due to distance and lack of public transportation. \"Many view driving as a major criteria of their independence,\" says Dr. Naglie. \"Loss of a driver's license can lead to social isolation and depression. It can also lead to people not eating properly.\" Doctors unsure So how do family doctors feel when they have to tell older patients to stop driving and find some other mode of transport? Unsure and worried, according to a new study by Dr. Naglie and colleagues from CanDRIVE. In the survey of 460 family doctors across Canada, more than 80% of respondents said that driving assessment is an important issue in their practice, yet over 40% did not feel confident in their ability to evaluate patients' fitness to drive. In most provinces, physicians are legally obligated to report drivers who they believe may be unsafe behind the wheel. Significantly, 75% thought that reporting patients who they believe may be unsafe to drive had negative impact on the doctor-patient relationship.A loss of independence Most older people are perfectly fine to drive, but some are not. \"When they are not, it is our unpleasant duty as physicians to inform them that we have to report our concerns to the licensing authorities, \" says Dr. Naglie. \"This probably means they will have their licenses revoked. For many people, this is an incredible loss. \"There's more we could do to make giving the news and dealing with the repercussions much better. There needs to be more concentration on retraining or possibly restricted licensing that will allow people to maintain their independence longer, in a safe way. We could be doing a better job with alternative transportation, including special arrangements and discounts with cab companies for people in this situation.\" Better understanding Health professionals also need to have a better understanding of diseases and medications that impair older people's ability to drive. For physicians, one major problem is the lack of guidelines in this area. \"How do you ascertain who is safe, and how often do you reassess them?\" asks Dr. Naglie. Members of Can DRIVE are now working with the Canadian Medical Association on the next edition of the association's driving assessment guide. They are also hoping to develop a tool that can assist physicians in assessing patients' driving risk. \"This is something physicians are asking for,\" says Dr. Naglie. \"But we all have a personal stake in this. It's one of those issues of public safety versus individual rights.\"1\u0018 Watch for the warning signs Following are 10 questions you can ask your clients to see if they're safe on the road: Have you noticed a change in your driving skills? Do others honk or show signs of irritation? Have you lost confidence in your driving ability, leading you to drive less often? Have you ever become lost when driving? Have you ever forgotten where you are going? Do you think you are a safe driver? Have you had any car accidents in the past year? Any minor fender benders with other cars in parking lots?

He lamented, \"My hair line is in recession, my stomach is a victim of inflation, and both of these together are putting me into a deep depression!\" We can't help but grow older physically, but we can stay young in other ways. Though I cannot credit the original author, I think the following piece, sent in by a reader, is worth repeating. Do you want to stay young? Here are some tips on how to stay young Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight and height. Let the doctor worry about them. That is why you pay him/her. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever. Never let the brain idle. \"An idle mind is the devil's workshop.\" Enjoy the simple things. When the children are young, that is all that you can afford. When they are in college, that is all that you can afford. When you are on retirement, that is all that you can afford!1\u0018 Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. Laugh so much that you can be tracked in the store by your distinctive laughter. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be alive while you are alive, don't put out a mailbox on the highway of death and just wait in residence for your mail. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it is family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Y our home is your refuge. Cherish your health. If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help. Don't take guilt trips. Go to the mall, the next county, a foreign country, but not to guilt country. At every opportunity, tell the people you love that you love them. Anonymous AuthorOUR HEALTH Anterior Pelvic Tilt: Evaluating and Correcting a Common Seating Posture Many people who use wheelchairs have a preference for anterior pelvic tilt and upright - to slightly forward-oriented sitting, which allows them to function. If these individuals do not receive proper training, education, and seating intervention, this persistent tendency can lead to adaptive shortening of both muscle and non-contractile tissues that limit the potential for postural correction. This article will address the bio-mechanics, evaluation, intervention and treatment of anterior pelvic tilt in sitting. Clinicians and suppliers must conduct a thorough evaluation to determine all of the factors influencing their client's ability to sit safely and function in their wheelchairs. Intervention is directed towards optimal postural alignment for nondestructive resting postures and preparation for and support of mobility and function. Intervention must be mindful of what people need to doing their wheelchairs, how long they must do it, and in what environments. Interventions for the sitter with an anterior pelvic tendency versus the posterior pelvic tendency are very different. Location of support surfaces and orientation of supports relative to gravity are nearly opposite. Lack of attention to these differences often results in people with posterior tendencies sliding out of their chairs and people with anterior tendencies falling forward away from their back supports. A basic 1\u0018 understanding of these principles will lead to effective, long-term seating interventions. Different interventions The anterior pelvic tilt and forward orientation of trunk relative to pelvis is a very functional posture. When actively controlled, this posture provides access to all kinds of functional activities. Almost everything an able-bodied person does functionally is preceded by an active anterior and lateral weight shift, so it should be no surprise that a person with a disability desires the same. The problem experienced by a person with a disability occurs when the ability to sustain active control in an anterior orientation diminishes, but the desire to be forward does not. This leads to a passive collapse into the anterior posture and becomes a destructive resting posture. Over time, the hip flexors adaptively shorten and the hip capsule may lose flexibility. As the tendency persists, the lumbar lordosis increases, and the thoracic spinal curve may reverse from a normal kyphosis to a lordotic curve. The cervical curve may increase or decrease depending on the degree of forward rotation at the hips. Early seating intervention The goal of early intervention is to influence how a person moves forward for function and to create support for a non-destructive resting posture. A posterior slope of the seat will promote a posterior tendency of the pelvis, yet observation of most seating interventions for \"anterior tilters\" reveals level to minimal posterior slope. A posterior slope of the seat will help keep the pelvis and lumbar spine stabilized into a back support during rest and promote use of trunk flexion, rather than hip flexion, to transition forward for function.The choice for seating and manual wheelchair options that allow for adjustment of seat and back angle over time to maintain postural flexibility and optimal function is essential. Once the site loses the ability to actively restore a resting posture with good spinal alignment and pelvis and lumbar spine stabilized into a back support, progression of contractions may rapidly ensue. Manual If a manual wheelchair continues to be the choice for mobility, then passive stabilization of the pelvis and lumbar spine into the back support may be an option. Y ou may try a well-padded, four- point-mount pelvic- positioning belt capturing the anterior superior illiac spine (ASIS) with a horizontal direction of pull towards the back canes with the additional strap directed vertically to the seat-rails to prevent upward movement of the belt into the abdomen. If the tendency for collapse is too strong, this intervention may result in skin irritation or breakdown. In this case, an abdominal panel capturing the ASIS and abdomen may be necessary. If left untreated, the anterior collapse may result in loading of the ASIS directly on to the femurs leading to skin breakdown and other complications. Power If power mobility is chosen, then power tilt, along with a generous dose of education, is essential. Oftentimes, a person with the desire to be forward may be unaware of the need to reverse the tendency during rest. Persistence in this habit results in the debilitating progression 1\u0018 outlined above. Educating a sitter to use the tilt function to restore trunk support during rest is critical. Doing this early and often is key in maintaining hip and spinal flexibility, and warding off the need for anterior trunk supports. Instruct the client to tilt forward for functional activities and tilt back for rest. The earlier the intervention, the lesser amount of tilt will be needed to restore the trunk into a back support. Tilt will most likely be needed for regular pressure relief as well, and the person needs to be educated to tilt the system fully for an effective weight shift. Optimal postural alignment Pelvic tendencies in standing versus sitting are different. Understanding why is essential for a wheelchair seating practitioner. Assessment of people relative to their predominant pelvic tendency in sitting is a necessary step in determining appropriate seating intervention. An accurate assessment will lead to definition of clear goals and successful interventions. Effective wheelchair seating will help secure long-term optimal postural alignment for non- destructive resting postures and preparation for and support of mobility and function..

It is focused on building links between the aging and developmental disability sectors. The purpose is to support healthy aging and community participation in Nova Scotia for persons aging with developmental disabilities. All seniors need access to meaningful activities and the opportunity to receive the supports they need in a place they call home. To date, there has been little information about the needs of older adults with developmental disabilities who are nearing retirement. This project offers an opportunity to learn what is needed to help these seniors to participate in their communities and to \"age in place.\" Developments of the project include: Provincial network meeting that brought together service providers, planners, and policy-makers from both sectors to discuss common interests and key policy issues Seniors' community participation initiatives to help understand more about inclusion Needs assessment report to increase understanding of what is needed to support community inclusion (this report can be downloaded at www.msvu.ca/Aging is not \"lost youth\" but a new stage of opportunity and strength. - Betty Friedan1\u0018 ARCFamilyW ork/pdf_files/The_Next_ Stage_Needs_Assessment_Report.pdf ) A Retirement Planning Resource Guide for older adults with developmental disabilities, their families and friends, and for organizations that provide services to them. This Resource Guide will also be useful for organizations that provide services to seniors (it will be available in March) What is being learned from the project? The importance of retirement planning around the issue of \"aging in place\" is important for everyone who is growing older. There is a need to develop policy and programs that support the needs of all groups of seniors, with the specific focus in this project being on the needs of persons aging with developmental disabilities. The need for more education and awareness of the resources available in both the disability and aging sectors to foster relationships between the sectors and promote community inclusion. How can you become involved? A Provincial Network of interested people from both sectors is being developed for information sharing and story telling on topics such as healthy aging and community inclusion. If you would like to be involved please contact the Project Coordinator listed below. The project involves many partners working together who represent both sectors in Nova Scotia: Nova Scotia Seniors' Secretariat Maritime Data Centre for Aging Research and Policy Analysis and Nova Scotia Centre on Aging, Mount Saint Vincent University Department of Family Studies and Gerontology, Mount Saint Vincent University Disabled Persons Commission Nova Scotia Association for Community Living DirectioNS Council of Nova Scotia Regional Residential Services Society Nova Scotia Department of Community Services, Services for Persons with Disabilities Department of Health, Continuing Care Branch NSCC, School of Health and Human Services For more information about the project please contact the Project Coordinator at NSCC, Samantha Butler, at (902) 491-1616 or at samantha.butler@nscc.ca . Mount Saint Vincent University Offers Studies in Families and Aging Mount Saint Vincent University is committed to engaging students in a variety of professional studies, including the Family Studies and Gerontology degree. As a fourth year student studying gerontology, I have come to fully recognize the value that a degree such as this has. Seniors and understanding the contributions they make to their families and communities are beneficial to the overall health and well-being of the whole society. It is important, therefore, to continue to study the dynamics of families and aging so that as future professionals within our communities, we may effectively work together 1\u0018 to serve and meet the needs of those in society. The origins of the Family Studies and Gerontology degree program can be traced back to the Home Economics program that began at Mount Saint Vincent University in 1926. Currently, the degree offers a variety of courses that contributing to the professional development of students through both academic studies and practical experience, allowing for an extensive knowledge base within the field. Faculty members are very knowledgeable, each bringing a variety of specialty research and experience to the program. Upon completion of the undergraduate degree, students may opt to continue their studies and enter the FSGN Masters Degree program, also offered through MSVU, or, they may choose to pursue other areas of interest that complement the FSGN degree through additional studies and/or career choices. In addition, FSGN students enjoy participating in volunteer activities and society events that promote the program and make a positive difference in the community. In an upcoming event to take place on March 28, 2007, students and faculty from the Family Studies and Gerontology department, as well as the Applied Human Nutrition department, are celebrating 80 years of Home Economics at Mount Saint Vincent University. The goal is to promote both departments and to generate funds for future scholarships within these departments. By celebrating the past, we are able to look toward the future and the continued growth and development of the Family Studies and Gerontology department at Mount Saint Vincent University.Rebecca Mitton is a senior student in the Family Studies and Gerontology program at Mount Saint Vincent University and is currently doing a work placement at the Seniors' Secretariat. Upon graduating in May 2007, she plans to further her gerontological studies in advocacy and in acquiring translating and interpreting skills in American Sign Language. Age-Friendly Communities by Tessa Graham The World Health Organization is leading a global project to develop a tool that will assist cities to become more senior friendly as the population in most countries ages significantly. Canada has taken the lead in this project and, at the provincial level, British Columbia is one of three provinces, along with Manitoba and Nova Scotia, who were asked by the federal government to participate. Even more exciting, the municipality of Saanich was chosen through a call to all local governments with a population over 10,000 to be the pilot site for British Columbia. Saanich, with a population of 113,000 and a large seniors population, fit the bill. Sidewalks with no cracks, bank doors light enough for one person to open, restaurant bathroom stalls wide enough to accommodate a walker, businesses which actively recruit older adults as employees and recreation programs that mix the old and yung are just some examples of what makes an age friendly community.\u00180 Such a community prevents and corrects barriers that people increasingly encounter as they grow older. In an age-friendly community, policies, services and structures related to the physical and social environment are designed to support and enable older people to live in security, enjoy good health and participate fully in society. Saanich is a large suburban community, which has worked on a number of initiatives. Whether it's their Adaptable Housing Bylaw, Active Aging Strategy, Senior-Friendly Pilot Project in Shelburne Corridor, or Living Actively in Y our Community program, the municipality understands seniors are valuable to community life. \"There is not doubt Saanich is changing,\" says Councillor Judy Brownoff. \"Having had many conversations with our maturing population, it is evident that they consider Saanich a good place to age, but they do face some challenges in their day-to-day life.\" \"There is an African saying: 'It takes a village to raise a child,'\"says Brownoff, \"and I believe it takes a whole community, from municipal government, senior government, businesses and neighbours to help ensure we are age friendly now and in the future.\" In collaboration with the UVIC Centre on aging and the Ministry of Health, focus groups with seniors, caregivers, businesses, municipal leaders and nonprofit organizations discussed what makes an age-friendly city. Issues covered included outdoor spaces and buildings, transportation, housing, respect and social inclusion, social participation, communication and information, civic participation, employment, community support and health services. The focus groups finished in December and the results will be collated over the spring and added to the results of the other 27 participating cities around the world. Other cities include Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, London, Geneva, Istanbul, Moscow, New Delhi, T okyo and Melbourne. Saanich, Vancouver island and British Columbia are truly part of a global community. The Guide for Age-Friendly Cities will be released around the world on October 1, 2007, International Day of Older Persons. Given this project focuses exclusively on cities, Canada is also leading a parallel project that specifically examines rural and remote communities. Similar to the city project, a call went out to all the local governments with populations less than 2500 to seek their participation in the rural and remote-friendly community project. T wo small communities chosen as pilot sites were Lumby and Alert Bay, BC. \"We are very pleased to partner and participate in the Age-Friendly Rural and Remote Communities Initiative,\" says the mayor of Lumby, Eric Foster. 'It is our belief that an age-friendly and healthy community consists of all residents and ages being considered in community decisions, and with an ever-aging society, it would be our objective that through this initiative our community will be in a position to have our residents age in place with all the necessary services available, and that the results of this initiative will be of assistance to other communities in achieving their objectives.\" Focus groups in these two communities will begin in the spring and include seniors, caregivers, local businesses and organizations as well as municipal employees and other community leaders. \"The Village of Alert Bay, in partnership with our neighbours, the Namgis First nation, is extremely pleased to be chosen to take part in \u00181 the Age-friendly Rural and Remote Communities Initiative, ' says Mayor john Rowell. \"We already have a reputation of being a friendly community, as is evident by the comments of many of our visitors. After this project, we look forward to being known as especially age-friendly. As a senior myself, I look forward to the results of this study which will give us a road map to be followed in achieving this objective, and will help other communities to serve the needs of their aging citizens.\" The guide for age-friendly rural and remote communities should be completed by the fall. All communities in British Columbia will then have a guide to assist local planners on how to design and adapt their environments with seniors' needs and capacities in mind. Making cities and smaller communities age friendly is one of the most effective policy approaches to respond to demographic aging. (Note: Halifax, Nova Scotia is one of four Canadian cities, along with Saanich, BC, Portage LaPrairie, MB, and Sherbrooke, PQ, participating in the development of the World Health Organization's Age-Friendly Cities Guide. Guysborough, Nova Scotia has been chosen as one of the participants in the rural communities project.) Tess Graham is the Executive Director for Healthy Children, Women and Seniors at the Ministry of Health. She is also the project leader for both age- friendly projects.

The Right Stuff Want to know if a particular Pilates class is right for you? Here are some helpful questions to ask your instructor. Where did you train? Ideally, a qualified Pilates instructor's training takes place over many weeks or months not just a weekend course. There's no group that oversees Pilates qualifications in North America, so you'll have to judge for yourself whether an instructor seems qualified enough. \u0018\u0018 What's your teaching style? Find out the instructor's approach to verbal instructions and demonstrating and helping students adjust the movements. Choose someone you think you'll be able to follow. How big is the class? The smaller the class, the more attention you'll get, and the more you'll learn. In a bigger group, you're likely to make more friends, and perhaps even find a buddy to help you stick with it. What style will you be using? Classical Pilates is based directly on the work of Joseph Pilates. Some instructors use pre-Pilates, which is less intense. Stott Pilates was developed in T oronto; it's modified the practice to incorporate modern exercise principles, such as different ideas about spinal alignment. Certain classes combine yoga and Pilates, which means there's more stretching. No one style is better than another, but it's good to know which one you're taking.
