You can support healthy kidney function by adding certain foods and beverages to your diet. If you have a deficiency in a key nutrient, supplements may also help. The [kidneys](/human-body-maps/kidney) are two small organs located on either side of the spine, below the ribs. They play an important role in: - getting rid of excess waste - balancing electrolytes - creating hormones In the absence of disease, a well-rounded diet and [adequate water intake](/health/how-much-water-should-I-drink) are usually enough to keep your kidneys healthy. However, certain foods, herbs, and supplements can help support strong kidneys. From your morning glass of water to that extra cup of herbal tea, here are four ways to cleanse your kidneys and keep them functioning strong. The adult human body is composed of [almost 60 percent water](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/propertyyou.html). Every single organ, from the brain to the liver, requires water to function. As the filtration system of the body, the kidneys require water to secrete urine. Urine is the primary waste product that allows the body to get rid of unwanted or unnecessary substances. When water intake is low, urine volume is low. A low urine output may lead to kidney dysfunction, such as the creation of [kidney stones](/health/kidney-stones). It's crucial to drink enough water so that the kidneys can properly flush out any excess waste materials. This is especially important during a kidney cleanse. The recommended daily intake of fluids is roughly 3.7 liters and 2.7 liters a day for men and women, respectively, according to the [Institute of Medicine](https://www.nap.edu/read/10925/chapter/6). Grapes [Grapes](/health/food-nutrition/are-grapes-good-for-you), peanuts, and some berries contain a beneficial plant compound called [resveratrol](/nutrition/resveratrol). In one [animal study](https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/31/11/1826/2469103), researchers found that treatment with resveratrol was able to lower kidney inflammation in rats with [polycystic kidney disease](/health/polycystic-kidney-disease).

Dried cranberries are a deliciously sweet addition to trail mix, salads, or even oatmeal. Fruit juices Lemon, orange, and melon juice all contain citric acid, or citrate. Citrate helps prevent kidney stone formation by binding with calcium in urine. This inhibits the growth of calcium crystals, which can lead to kidney stones. In addition, drinking a cup of fresh juice per day can contribute to your daily recommended fluid intake. Seaweed [Brown seaweed](/health/why-is-brown-seaweed-good-for-you) has been studied for its beneficial effects on the pancreas, kidneys, and liver. In a 2014 [animal trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3910465/) Try a packet of dried, seasoned seaweed the next time you're craving a crunchy snack. Calcium-rich foods Many people believe that avoiding calcium can help prevent kidney stones. In fact, the opposite is true. Too much urinary oxalate can lead to kidney stones. Calcium is needed to bind with oxalate to reduce the absorption and excretion of this substance. You can meet the recommended daily intake of 1.2 grams of calcium by consuming [high-calcium foods](/nutrition/15-calcium-rich-foods), such as: - soy or almond milk - tofu - fortified cereals Hydrangea Hydrangea is a gorgeous flowering shrub, well known for its lavender, pink, blue, and white flowers.

B6 is required for the metabolism of glyoxylate, which can become oxalate instead of glycine if B6 is deficient. As mentioned above, too much oxalate may lead to kidney stones. Supplement with [a daily B-complex vitamin that provides at least 50 milligrams of B6.](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=B-complex+daily+vitamin&i=aps&tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) According to the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB), adults should not exceed [100 mg a day](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/) Omega-3s The standard Western diet is often high in inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids and low in beneficial [omega-3 fatty acids](/nutrition/17-health-benefits-of-omega-3).
