Conceived, developed, and implemented by Senior Program Coordinator George Sunderland, this program was designed to involve local law enforcement officials as resource persons. Despite the significant contributions made by these professionals, it was discovered that a lack of specialized training often limited their understanding and ability to deal effectively with the elderly. For this reason, the Associations began conducting seminars in 1973 to deliver such specialized training to law enforcement trainers, administrators, and others in the criminal justice system. Our experience with hundreds of such seminars throughout the country led the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to fund us in 1976 to develop the first formalized national course on \"Law Enforcement and Older Persons.\" Since that time, the course has been used 'regularly in many law enforcement training academies throughout the United States, introduced in 14 foreign countries, and translat~d into three languages. (rI With the support and guidance from LEAA, we are able to present this revised training course, which we believe is' another major step toward dealing with the unique relationship of older persons to the criminai justice system. II Our Associations are\u00b7 deeply grateful for the enthusias}lctsupport and cooperation of the law en\u00ad forcement community in this effort, which is part of\":ur continuing commitment to public service. iii Cyril F.

J INTRODUCTION In 1976, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration awarded the Associations a grant to proceed wIth the development of a curriculum base for training law enforcement professionals to understand and deal more effectively with older persons. An inquiry into the existing state of the art on police relations with older persons found that there was a sparsity of information and training in this subject. .' We designed a training curriculum, pilot-tested the materials, and disseminated \"Law Enforce- ment And Older Persons,\" the first major structured training course of its kind. The demand from training academies, criminal justice institutions, law enforcement administrators, and police practi\u00ad tioners far exceeded our capability to provide training assistance in this new area. Tn April, 1978, LEAA awarded the Associations additional funds to continue training efforts and to refine and revise the first edition of the manual. This course is the direct outcome of those efforts. )) The revised training course has been expanded as a result of research, evahiation, and.Jhe exten\u00ad sive experience g:l],ined from the implementation of over 30 law enforcemenLtraining semirtars across the nation. Grant staff designed a new training format to facilitate use of the {Jurriculum, conceptualized and tested student exercises, and designed new visual aids, including overheads, tapes, and slides. These tools for trainers will further enhance the impact of training for users of this course. From 1977 to the completion of the training effort in 1979, more than 2,000 law enforcement per\u00ad sonnel received NRTA-AARP sponsored instruction. Further, over 700 training academies, educa\u00ad tional institutions, police agencies, and sheriffs' departments tiave received the training manual. u Based on the experience gained from the broad dissemination of the ideas and concepts contained in the revised training curriculum, we anticipate that police executives, trainers and, above all, police officers, can use this manual to improve the services they provide to older persons. Purpose of Training The training addresses the general needs and concerns of the aging population and provides recommendations to improve police service delivery to this group . This curriculum would not be complete if It neglected to consider the future of law enforcement relations with older persons. Thus, the first lesson, \"The Graying of America,\" emphasizes the present and growing need for law enforcement efforts both for and with older Amr,ricans. To provide a' framework for training, Module One explores the general status of older persons and develops workable guidelines for effectively dealing with thein. Module Two analyzes the incidence of criminal victimization and its impact upon older persons, as well as effective countermeasures . 1 I Ii I, 'I if I III 11 ~1 i 'I I: :1 1 1 1 1 ) --.. -.-.-,,- \"\" A priority need of police!p'ractitioners is to communicate effectively with older persons. Module Three focuses on methods and techniques to enable officers .to provide effective professional assistance to older victims, witnesses, and persons in need of assistance. It presents techniques of delivering programs to older audiences, along with policy guidelines for law enforcement/media relations. Not to be forgotten is the older citizen's role in assisting law enforcement. Module Four provides the framework for the planning, implementation, and maintenance of programs involving older per\u00ad sons in criminal justice support roles\":\"focusing on police, <:ourts, and related community services. Also included are descriptions of model resource program types and actual case r~ports of law en\u00ad forcement programs with older persons. These are presente4 as current examples of programs which tap the resources of older citizens in their service to the l~\\v enforcement mission. This training curriculum does not provide all the answers. Rather, it preseI.ts the guidelines for in\u00ad novative change by the law enforcement practitioner. It is to this individual that we address ourselves; for he must, through rational and logical planning, bring about the needed changes in his community. It is our objective that other criminal justice system professionals will join with us in this endeavor, making this book the beginning, rather than the end.

In order to meet the victimization concerns and needs of the elderly, law enforcement professionals must understand the general attitudes, characteristics, and needs of our aging population. But even then the understanding will not be com\u00ad plete unless law enforcement also recognizes, and takes action to tap, the support and resources older citizens can provide to law enforcement efforts. The graying of America is a present as well as a future reality. The future is not some far-off time. Am~ri!;a will encounter demographic changes over the next decade which will have important political, social, and economic implications. The impact of these changes on the role of law enforce\u00ad ment requires that police administrators move away from a reactive role and begin to anticipate future service delivery needs. Exercising leadership by hindsight is irresponsible and costly in both human and fiscal terms. Law enforcement must look ahead today to plan for effective service delivery tomorrow. This is not an impossible task to accomplish; the resources for predicting future needs are available. Futurists at work today both in government and the private sector have developed technologies to look at aging trends and to forecast alternatives for the future-these technologies enable decision-makers in business, government, and law enforcement to identify new policy options that normally are overlooked. ATTITUDES ABOUT AGING Attitudinal studies reveal that older Americans believe aging \"happens to someone else.\" When older persons are asked about other older persons, theY,accept many of the same stereotypes held by the general pubHc. Older people who are healthy, active, and alert assume that they are different from ot~ers in their same age bracket. In a Louis Harris poll conducted in 1974, the elderly identified crime as their most serious per\u00ad sonal problem. 1 This means law enforcement agencies must address the perception of crime pro\u00ad blem, regardless of the actual victimization rates for older persons in their jurisdictions. Other pro\u00ad blems identified such as loneliness and money needs, will also affect law enforcement service delivery methods. The simple fact that law enforcement officers interact with older persons in a wide variety of situations-as victims, witnesses, offenders, in non-crime situations (such as accidents or injuries) and in police support roles-requires a personal understanding of one's own attitudes about aging . 1-1 , How the officer views his own aging, particularly his anxieties and fears and even his denial of the aging process, can be a key factor in the success or failure of his role as a law enforcement officer who is providing services to the elderly. Identifying his feelings about significant older people throughout his life and his present feelings toward people in their later years is also important. Is he impatient? Is he empathic? Is he emotionally involved in ways that may be counterproduc~ive, such as encouraging dependency and child-like behavior rather than independence and self-fulfIllment as much as possible? Can he distinguish between the myths and realities of aging? What stereotypes does the officer hold and what values affect his work with this population? How an officer answers questions like these has a profound effect upon his ability to work effectively with older adults. The ways in which we grow older are strongly reflected by our attitudes about 8\"ging. That, in itself, is an important reason to focus upon more positive attitudes about growing old. As we li~e from day to day and our experiences accumulate, we will be affected personally by the manner In which we define and adjust to old age. WHO ARE THE ELDERLY? Attempts to adequately identify the elderly population have generated conflict among specialists in aging. Even where benefits are afforded to older persons under Federal legislation, the age at which individuals become eligible for those benefits varies (the relevant age is 40 under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, 60 to receive nutritional services under the Older Americans Act, 55 to receive help in making the transition from one occupation to another under the Com\u00ad prehensive Employment Training Act, and 62 and/or 65 to receive Social Security and Medicare). Certain occupational groups, such as law enforcement, are forcing personnel to retire in their fifties. These conflicts in defining the elderly result because gerontologists have rejected a strictly chronological definition of old age, arguing that factors other than birthdays are more prominent in determining whether an individual is \"old.\" Such factors include, but are not limited to, measures of physical functioning, employment status, live activities, self-perception, and the interaction of these variables with others. However, gerontologists have been working to create spedalized defini\u00ad tions of the older population, using such terms as young-old (ages 55 to 65), middle-C':1d (ages 65-75), and old-old (ages 75 and over). Despite the variety of opinions on the definition of \"old age,\" some mention needs to be made regarding the people about whom this text is written. These training materials focus upon those per\u00ad sons who are over 60 years of age and who are experiencing the physiologkal and psychological changes that are more characteristic of old age than of any other period in life. While som.e law en\u00ad forcement agencies are using age 60 as a statistical baseline for col~ecting victimization data on the elderly, any definition of the elderly is useful only for the aggregrate, and does not adequately reflect the heterogeneity of this group. Just as there is no chronological age to mark the beginning of old age, there is no commonly ac\u00ad cepted word to describe the elderly. Some terms, such as \"senior citizen,\" seem to bf! less desirable than persons,\" \"older adults,\" and \"older Americans\" s'eem to be more acceptable to more people than terms such as \"elderly\" or \"aged.\" Whl.!11 addressing an older per\u00ad son or an older group, perhaps the best approach is to ask the individual or group which terms they prefer. 1-2 f / \"(' ... / .

Efforts to mcrease 1 ex. years are miserable.6 medical advances against diseases and control of the aging process itself have not yet occurred, it is an indisputable fact that even without any oj these medical technologies older persons still represent an increasingly larger proportion of the population. This group has certain needs which are only dimly .recognized and served and which could be changing in the future. There will be greater demands placed upon society to meet the essential needs of the elderly-retirement security, housing, food, clothing, transportation, medical care, and delivery of services. The old-old (those over 75 years old) are the fastest increasing part of the 60 + population. With the growing number of perSGns in this age category, communities will have to provide comprehensive support systems. The impacts of the changing age distribution in our society in general are not yet clearly understan\u00ad dable, but these impacts could prove to be very important, not only to the elderly, but to society at largf!. POLITICAL PARTICIPATION Older persons are a growing political force. Although they do not necessarily constitute a unified voting bloc, there is a growing sense of political activism and concern among the elderly over issues which dramatically affect their lives. Traditionally, the elderly's voting percentages are higher than those of other age groups. As their numbers increase, the elderly will have a greater power to com\u00ad mand the attention of public officials who will need their votes to survive. Many older persons are members of boards of trustees and advisory councils. They serve on com\u00ad mittees at all levels of community activity, including public housing, nursing and old-age homes, hospitals, voluntary agencies, health and welfare councils, community health centers, zoning agen\u00ad cies, company pension boards, pharmacies, city and state committees and commissions, and federal councils. They are often generous about contributing their time to help manage the established in\u00ad stitutions of society. Older persons are more likely than younger citizens to become personally involved in community political activities. Community groups and organizations, which are not by nature political, (such as bridge clubs and housing associations) often become involved in politics. In areas of limited special interest, it is easy to get a group consensus without having political labels for the group. Further, as older persons become more involved in community organizations, their knowledge of community concerns and problems grows. It is not uncommon to find that a local community group, such as a condominium association, will contact the police department when group members become con\u00ad cerned about the security of their neighborhood. This often happens after minor incidents, such as vandalism to cars. As influential community residents and leaders, the elderly can exert influence upon community attitudes toward the police department, attitudes that are positive/supportive or negative/hostile. It is in the best interests of the police department to enlist the support of the com- . munity's older leaders. Older persons also take a leadership role in society from a national perspective and have begun, in recent years, to develop more aggressive postures toward the Congress and State legislatures, par\u00ad ti.cularly when these governmental bodies are propnsing statutory changes which may have a negative impact upon the welfare of the elderly. For example, there are now many major national organizations which either represent exclusively the needs of the elderly or have large programs for the elderly and/or for the professionals who work with them. These organizations include: 7 1-7 4P ulan\" a , 4H\"'.X ti II i! !

National Council of Senior Citizens (nearlyA million member!). National Association of Retired Federal Employees (over 3,00,000 members). Gray Panthers (about 8,000 members). The older person's voice is beip.g heard at the federal, state, and local levels of government. In re\u00ad cent years, a large number of governmerltal and nongovernmental programs have b~e~ pr~moted and financed on behalf of older citizens. By knowing more about the elderly and the difficulties and changes they face, law enforcement can come to grips with their problems and provide more effec- tive service delivery. . EDUCATION )J The elderly today have completed fewer years of school than the general population. This was due to less emphasis upon schooling and more limited opportunities for higher education when the cur\u00ad rent older population was of school and college age. One in every eight members of the older age I I . group is functionally illiterate (less \"than five years of schooling).9 The rural elderly u~ually have less schooling than the urban elderly. On the more positive side, however, the median years of education for those over age 60 are rising steadily. The future older population will have more formal education. ECONOMIC STATUS /l Th . 't t' f ld . (( I' .... eeconomlC SI ua 0 er person lOyo ves lOcome, partIclpatlOn 10 the labor force, and the effects of retirement. \\ Most older people have the financial resources. to Be self-sufficient, but very large numbers of older persons find themselves with lower incomes and assets than younger persons. The average in\u00ad come of the older family is approximately half of the income of the average younger family, while the elderly spend larger amounts of money on housing, food, and medical care than younger per- sons.10 . Since many older persons live on fixed, reduced incomes, they have an increased need for com\u00ad munity support services and police assistance. The only widely held asset among older persons is a home; as homeowners they are vulnerable to such criminals as con artists, vandals, and burgiars. The amount of older men in the labor force has been decreasing steadily. Two out of three men between the ages of 60 and 64 work. However, at ages 70 and over, only about one out of six men are working. Conversely, the worker proportion for older women is fairly steady-one out of 12 women aged 6S and over work. 11 For financial reasons or for their own peace of mind, many older persons cannot afford to be out of work for very long. Many myths about older workers have been addressed by recent research studies in business and industry. These studies have found that older persons maintain high levels of productivity, low acci\u00ad dent rates, low absenteeism, low job turn-over rates, and have fewer difficulties in finding or keep- ing jobs. , The elderly of the future will have worked in higher-paying occupations and in more than one job type or career. They will have greater incomes and other financial resources. A higher proportion of older women will have participated in the labor force and will have their own retirement benefits. Retirement, which usually reduces income by one-half or two-thirds may result in poverty.12 The proportion of older persons living below the poverty level is much higher for Jhose who live alone than for those living with families. Many poor older persons are widows who found that their Social Security or retirement benefits ended when their husbands died or that their savings were simplY not sufficient to withstand the ravages of inflation. The limited and reduced incomes of the elderly will mean that many older crime victims will experience a relatively more severe economic loss when their money is stolen from th~m. A pursesnatching or burglary may result in the iriability of the older victim to absorb or recuperate from loss. 1-9 , Participation In The Work Force Changes in the retirement age will cause fundamental changes in the economy and in the way older persons live and view themselves. Recent legislation eliminated mandatory retirement for federal government employees and raised the mandatory retirement age to 70 in the private sector. As more aging people continue to work longer, it is anticipated that there will be an accompanying broader base of support for the Social Security and private pension systems. Although this may help to ease the burden upon. workers who are contributing to the support of those who are retired, the increased size of the labor force will have significant effects upon society. There will be increased productivity and socialization for older persons. However, there may be a problem providing jobs for all who wish to work. Providing enough jobs will require various innovations in working arrangements such as shared work, part-time work, a shortened work week, and serial careers.13 Furthermore, with changes in the nature of work because of such factors as automation and the increased participation of women in the labor force, there may be more competition for fewer jobs. If older persons continue to work longer years, this will have a direct effect upon the availability of jobs and the opportunities for promotion. Studies have documented that many retired persons would rather be working. For many, forced retirement shortens life expectancy and has negative effects on health. These issues directly affect law enforcement and require decision-makers to develop policies regarding retirement and alter\u00ad native working arrangements for older law enforcement professionals. In addition, because of shrinking budgets which lead to decreases in personnel, law enforcement administrators will need to augment their service delivery capabilities by recruiting and training para-professionals and volunteers to perform some of the tasks now carried out by fulltime civilian and sworn personnel. RESIDENCE AND MOBILITY The geographical distribution of the elderly population shows that every community will have older residents. However, almost half of the older population lives in seven states: California, New York, Florida, Illinois, Ohiol Pennsylvania, and Texas. Some areas have proportionately more older persons than other areas and have different demographic trends. The chart (Figure Four) shows the proportion of each state's elderly residents in relation to the total state population,14 Compared to younger persons, the elderly are much less likely to move. Yet, although relatively few older individuals change their residence, there are certain regions of the country which the elder\u00ad ly are mobile to and from. Older persons move to retirement states, such as Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. They generally move from the Northeast and the Midwest. The largest number of older persons live in urban areas-most of them live in central cities and the remainder reside in the urban fringe. Of those elderly persons who live in non-urban areas, most live in small rural towns (1,000 to 2,500 inhabitants) rather than on farms. Older persons are slightly more prevalent in rural areas than are younger people.

However, some futurists predict that as more women enter traditional male occupations, their life expectancy might more closely resemble that of males. Contrary to a prevailing stereotype, most older Americans live in normal communities and not in institutions. The most common living arrangement is the two-member family (husband and wife). Only five percent of older people live in institutions. This percentage has been rising as the old-old (those over 75 years old) population increases. The majority of those persons who are institu\u00ad tionalized live in nursing homes and not mental institution;;. The majority of nursing home residents are older white, widowed women,17 Most older persons live in a family setting. However, this proportion decreases with advancing age as more of the elderly live alone or with someone other than their spouse (son, daughter, other relative, or non-relative). The number of older persons who live with their children has decreased in recent years-the current trend is for older persons to live alone and maintain their own homes, resulting in greater independence as well as greater isolation. ' New living arrangements will probably develop, such as the multi-adult household. This household of the future is composed of a number of adults, often unrelated to each other by blood or marriage, who live together as a group. Today, however, the vast majority of older persons live in the community where they were employed and are dependent upon the same community services as the general population. YMCAs, churches, service clubs, the police and fire departments, bus and cab companies, electric companies, and all the other service agenci~s in the community have older people as clients or customers, if not as employees. The information presented above deals with the national' picture. This is very important as a backdrop against which to view the basic characteristics of older adults at the city and/or county level. Law enforcement agencies need to identify the older population in their own jurisdiction and anticipate demographic trends and their effects upon service needs. Police planners must address the size and growth of the older population and anticipate interstate migration rates of older persons to their areas. Specifically, each law enforcement agency will need to collect and interpret data on the older populaiion in its own jurisdiction. The older population should be broken down by age categories and identified by locale. Socio-economic descriptions of this population should be collected. This information is readily available. For example, the following agencies can provide data on aging:18 1. Any library serving as a repository of U.S. Government documents. Most libraries will have an annual census report.

University departments of planning or urban studies. 12. Voter registration records. 13. County vital statistics office. 14. University urban research centers. Once the inform~tion is collected, the police executive can apply this knowledge to various departmental operations, such as crime analysis, crime prevention programming, and departmental policies for handling older victims, witnesses, or offenders. MINORITY ELDERLY It is important for law enforcement officers to understand the unique cultural differences of elderly minorit~es and become sensitive to the compounded victimization difficulties an older minority person may experience. Three minority groups are described below, although other groups may also warrant particular attention. Depending upon the geographical location or the composi\u00ad tion of the community, the officer may want to select other groups for study. Older Black Americans The number of black elderly has steadily increased during this century and has grown rapidly in the past two years. However, their projected life expectancy is shorter than for older whites. Older blacks are geographically distributed In a pattern similar to that of the total black population. The largest concentrations are found in the southern states. Most older blacks live in central city areas. About one-fourth live in rural areas. There is a higher number of older black women who are widowed and alone, since black women tend to out-live black men. Three and one-half times more older black than older whites live in poverty. ' The black elderly are more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses and are less likely to seek profes- sional medical care than are older whites. ' ,~~'i<O.lif :. !!ii1M4ifiiIjijj~i'!;'iWl_\";!,lI!\"\"'_\"'':'''.t''_\"\",.~\"\",\",,';;;:'~~ / , I, ' One major difference between the composition of elderly black and white families is the increased likelihood that the older black family will have dependent children living with them. The majority of these children are grandchildren or children of other relatives. Consequently, child-rearing respon\u00ad sibilities are still widely prevalent among older blacks.19 -Older Hispanic Americans Hispanic Americans include individuals whose background is Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish origin. The three largest subgroups within this popula\u00ad tion are Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans. Most Hispanic Americans live in the five southwestern states of Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. Elderly Hispanic Americans follow a similar pattern of concentration in these five states and in New York and Florida. Hispanic families generally live in metropolitan areas. Like the aged population in general, most older Hispanic Americans are also urban dwellers. As with most other groups, older Hispanic males are likely to be married while older females are not. Many older Hispanics suffer from a limited command of the English language. Like elderly Italian-Americans and Polish-Americans, many older Hispanics gravitated toward ethnic enclaves within the cities upon their arrival in the United States-they never had to learn English in order to survive. 2o Older Asian Americans The Asian American population of the United States is composed primarily of Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, Koreans and Samoans, although there is a significantly large Vietnamese and Cambodian population in some urban areas. During much of this century, immigration quotas on persons from outside Europe or the Western Hemisphere greatly restricted the entry of Asians into this country. However, since the end of World War II, changes in the immigration laws have allowed a gradually increasing number of Asians to enter, and their pOPlilation has grown markedly. The Japanese are the largest subgroup, the Chinese the second largest, and the Filipino, the third largest. Older Asian Americans live primarily in California and Hawaii. Statistics on most groups of Asi~n Americans generally are believed to be inaccurate because of the large number of py6ple not reported due to their illegal immigrant status. The elderly Chinese Americans fall mainly into two different groups-those who came to this country in late childhood as laborers and those who are recently arrived immigrants. Chinese and Filipino elderly males outnumber females by as much as four to one. Asian Americans are concen\u00ad trated in urban areas and one out of every five elderly Asian AMericans is single.21 A pervasive myth about Asian Americans is that they do not de&ire or need aid to care for their elderly members. In reality, this is not the case. Some Asian American elderly have problems that are more intense and complex than the problems of the general aged population. Their suicide rate is three times higher than the national average. Many have no source of income since they were employed in occupations not covered by Social Security or private pensions. Language problems deny them the knowledge of how to obtain benefits and support. Even nutrition programs for the elderly have failed to include the special dietary and cultural preferences of the elderly Asian- 1-14 .-- ; American. For ex~mple, the food stamp program prohibited elderly Asians from purchasing ethnic foods with their stllmps. Such insensitivity to cultural preferences may act as a deterrent in providing services to those aged Asian Americans who require community support. These same problems sur\u00ad face among other ethnic groups. .' Providing For Service Delivery The minority elderly suffer many of the same problems as the general older population, although sometimes more acutely, Moreover, minority elderly have characteristics aside from their lower socioeconomic status which make them unique. Minority elderly groups are also affected by historical and cultural differences, communication and language barriers, differences in physical health, and ineligibility for various services. Because of poor health, many minority elderly do not reach their 60th birthday, and may experience \"old age\" at a younger chronological age. Minority groups have very low rates of institutionalization for their elderly. By being concen\u00ad trated in Chinatowns, barrios,. and ghettos, they have greater fears, experience more crime, and are often unwilling to bring their problems to law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement agencies need to identify elderly minority residents, contact community leaders, and establish lines of communication through support systems in the minority community. Large numbers of minority elderly are churchgoers and the police can work with the religious leaders to identify the law enforcement service needs of their congregations. Further, bilingual resources need to be tapped to enhance mutual trust and crime reporting. Community programs are essential to understand and meet the unique needs of minority older persons. Any, programs which are developed by law enforcement agencies must be responsive to the backgrounds, values, lifestyles, and concerns of the elderly minority groups in the community. The following organizations represent the needs of minority elderly groups and can direct law enforce\u00ad ment officers to the proper resources within their own communities: 22 National Center on Black Aged 1424 K Street, N.W., Suite 500 Washington, D.C. 20005 Phone: (202) 637-8400 National Indian Council on Aging P.O.

However, older people are sub\u00ad jected to more than their fair share of life's challenges and stresses, which threaten their sense of well-being. I i One of the most common stresses for older people af~ whole is the need to adjust to losses; often, these losses follow one right after the other, with no '. Jreathing space\" in between. Although peo\u00ad ple of all ages experience losses, the losses in later life become particularly difficult to handle when they are experienced simultaneously or in rapid succession. An older individual may be forced to ad\u00ad just to a loss of work, income, status~ choice, valued roles, social contacts, participation in society, home, physical health, mobility, spouse, loved ones, and friends. Any of these losses experienced in\u00ad dividually are difficult to deal with; encountered in multiples as they frequently are, they stretch a person's ability to adapt to the limits of emotional and physical endurance. For older persons ex\u00ad periencing multiple losses, the normal difficulties of daily living are compounded. Although later life is a period of potentially stressful transitions with multiple losses, this period also is accompanied by a series of gains. Over the life span, individuals display both change and stability-losses are accompanied by retentions and gains. Changes, whether gains or losses, will dif\u00ad fer in their onset. Some losses and other changes with age may be reversible. Some are immediately evident, such as baldness. Other changes are unknown or unnoticed, becoming evident only as a cumulative effect, sometimes reffered to as a \"sleeper effect.\" Each person will experience losses, retentions, and gains in varying degrees. These may include:23 Potential Losses Health and strength Hearing and vision Appearance and body image Reaction time Muscular dexterity Employment Income Independence, identity Sense of usefulness Time structure\u00b7 Social status Parents, spouse Children, i .. ,\\ / Retentions Knowledge Old learning Long-term memory Immediate memory Work productivity Personality traits Adaptability Creativity Sexuality Social awareness Nurturance Culture Coping mechanisms Sense of well-being Potential Gains Maturity, experience Frustration tolerance Cautiousness Accuracy Need for achievement Responsibility, reliability Steady work habits Work morale, loyalty Less supervision required Fewer job accidents Lower absenteeism Lower job turnover rate Higher job satisfaction More free time Interplay between physical and mental health' .

A decline in health may results in limitations in one's activities and considerable cost in time and money. There is a dual nature to the health of the elderly. The objective reality indicates declining health, eventually culminating in death. However, the subjective reality as perceived by large numbers of older persons is: \"Oh, yes, I do have problems-mild diabetes, 20 percent loss of hearing, one moderate coronary behind me, some arthritis-but I'm really fine.\"24 The lives of the majority of older Americans are affected daily by illnesses or impairments because chronic health problems increase sharply with advancing age. Heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis-four of the major chronic diseases-occur more frequently as aging pro\u00ad gresses. A principal consequence of these chronic health problems is an enforced limitation or total prevention of normal activities. About 40 percent of the elderly must limit their activities (including the ability to work, to keep house, and to participate in recreational or civic pursuits) because of chronic health conditions.25 Older people also experience a large number of acute conditions involving the restriction of ac\u00ad tivities or the need to seek medical attention. Older individuals average at least one such episode each year. The most common acute conditions are respiratory diseases and injuries to the skeletal structure, such as broken bones. Health care is expensive. The older person's annual health bill is about 300 percent higher than a younger person's bill.26 The health care costs paid by older persons today are higher than they were before the Medicare and Medicaid programs were established. The mental and physical status of the elderly depends upon their ability to function independently and their reliance upon personal suport from spouses, children, close friends, and neighbors. In the absence of personal support, the community has the responsibility to provide basic services for older persons in crucial areas, such as income maintenance, health, and transportation. Sometimes, an elderly person's personal support system will require community intervention. One important problem now identified involves cases of abuse of the elderly. This concern requires at- tention from law enforcement agencies. ABUSE OF THE ELDERLY There is increasing evidence that a number of middle-aged children (and older spouses) are physically and psychologically abusing their aging parents (or spouse) in a manner analogous to child abuse. This bas been referred to as \"granny-bashing\" or \"gram-slamming.\" It is probable that these situations will increase as greater numbers of parents live into old age and require care from relatives. 1-18 4 t 1 . . ~ 'I The minority of cases reported to poli d . 1 . psychological abuse.

Obviously, it is import~nt to reach those persons who do not have access to information sources. Older persons may be Isolated ~rom ~~wspapers, f m' formed peers and from social agencies and health facilities. At the same ~lme, It IS counter\u00ad :r~d~~tive to manip~late the elderly into accepting services that they don't particularly want. Therefore, to meet the continuum of needs of the elderly-ranging from the very demanding to the undemanding-major policy issues must be carefully assessed TRENDS IN VICTIMIZATION National surveys show that the elderly are not necessarily victimized by more crime than the rest of the population. However, there are certain crime types-robbery, purse snatching, fraud and bunco, burglary, and vandalism-which are more frequently committed against older persons than against younger age groups., Other crimes fn which older persons are not, frequent victims now-assault, auto theft, murder, and rape-may become crime problems in future years for this age group, Overall victimization rates, trends, and tendencies will shift with the growth of the older population and changing demographics. In the communitites which experience dramatic changes in the size and composition of their older populations, law enforcement agencies will need to clearly i4~lltify the crime problems; accurately assess the causes and effects of the victimization of the elder\u00ad ly, and be capable of confronting the problem. \" The causes and effects of the victimizati'on of the elderly are compOl~nded by the general at\u00ad titudes, characteristics, and needs of the aging population. Many of these attributes also increase the elderly person's vulnerability to crime. Five key factors in understanding the victimization of the elderly are described below: k' 1. Economic. The high incidence of reduced income among the elderly underlies their needs and problems-present and future. Any loss of economic resources has a greater impact when the ' economic status of the victim is low. The future elderly, who will have worked in higher-paying occupations and will have greater retirement benefits and other financial resources, still may not be able to keep 'up with inflation and higher costs of living. 2. Environmental. The high concentrations today of elderly residents in central cities and the greater likelihood that older persons will live in high crime neighborhoods puts them in close proximity to the groups most likely to victimize them. However, this trend is not likely to con\u00ad tinue in the future for two reasons. First, the future older popUlation will be urbanized, but not as concentrated in the central city; they will reside in the suburbs (but, if the suburbs become high crime areas and the same situation develops, then the problem will continue). Second, the offender profiles for the typical perpetrators of crimes against the elderly are mainly young opportunists. There will probably not be as many juveniles to commit crimes in the future because of declining birth rates. 3. Situational. About one-third of all older persons live alone and the current trend is for more elderly persons to maintain independent households. In addition to being more vulnerable to crime andJepeated victimization,older persons who live alone lack many of the social sup\u00ad ports whif!!ycan help them overcom(the consequences of the victimization experience. The need' for community support systems a.pd increased police service delivery is likely to increase in the future if even more older persons choose to live alone. \". 4. Physical. Physical aspects of aging increase the vulnerability of the elderly to crime. Older per\u00ad sons experience sensory perception changes and may not perceive threatening situations quick\u00ad ly enough to avoid them. Reduced physical strength and longer reaction times help explain why older persons may be reluctant to defend themselves or be unable to escape. Potential of\u00ad fenders are aware of these facts and readily target older persons as victims. A more vigorous older population will probably reduce vulnerability and victimization in this respect. 1-21 ';; elderly person's fear of criminal v~ctimizat~on is grea~IY influ~nced by the media. As an example, when the newspap~rs. depi:rct a Violent cru~e committed agal~st ,an old~r person, the older readers' level of fear will mcrease and they will respond b~ restnctmg theIr daily'living activities. Some studies suggest person's re~r ~f c~lme lea?s to ~f ~he nu~ber of ~1~tl~11lZatlOns ,,:hlch might have otherwise occurred. The overall effect of this IS to senously d.1mlmsh the quahty of m~ny older persons' lives. However, the changing attitudes and values of th~ future old~r ~eneratlo~ indicates they will increase their demands that law enforcement agencies be responsive to theIr needs and concerns. ATTITUDES OF THE ELDERi\\ TOWARD LAW ENFORCEMENT Older persons in general have positive attitudes toward law enforcement. They are ~or~ sati~fied with the performance of their local police agencies than are younger age group~. T~e fm?mgs ~n an attitudinal study of over 900 persons aged 60 and over conducted by the Umverslty City SCience Center reinforce previous research results. This study found that:28 88.7 percent of the older persons surveyed feel that the police have one of the most difficult jobs in our socil~ty. 74.2 percent feel that they can always tum to the police for help regardless of the type of pro\u00ad blem they are facing. 73.4 percent believe that the police are doing the best job they possibly can. These attitudes are subject to change, however, depending upon the effectiveness of police interac\u00ad tions with older persons who are requesting assistance. CRIME REPORTING BY THE ELDERLY As in the general population, about 50 percent of the elderly report cri~e. The m~jor variables in crime reporting are the amount of money invo~ved, clues as. to. who commlt~ed. the CrIme, or the feel\u00ad ing that reporting would aid in the apprehenSion of the cnml?al. The ma~onty. of the elderly non\u00ad reporters do not report crime because they tend to feel that either the polIce will not or cannot do anything about it or that the crime is not worth reporting. On the other hand, there are older per\u00ad sons with a high propensity to call law enforcement for assistnce with a wide variety of p~oblems. Typically this group has strongly perceived fears of victimization, spends time alone, and hves on a low fixed income. There are also some older chronic callers who contact police departments repeatedly . ,~,~ To enhance the ability to provide effective service, law enforcement agencies need to develop ap\u00ad proaches to each of these groups-the non-reporters, call~rs with unrealistic expectations, and the chronic callers. Suggestions for dealing with these groups mclude: 1. Non-reporters. The barriers or obstacles to reporting should .be remo~ed. One m~jor barder can be standard police reporting procedures, such as sendmg a umformed officer to the 1-22 -----, -- I victim's residence (in some inner city areas, victims are threatened with physical harm by the criminal if they notify the police-the arrival of a uniformed officer at the victim's residence would be observed by neighbors; because the victim fears the criminal will learn of the officer's visit, they avoid the problem by not reporting). Another barrier to reporting is a failure on the part of older victims to understand exactly what constitutes crimes and what they should or should not report. For example, older victims of vandalism may not realize they should report this crime. 2. Unrealistic callers. The police can overcome this problem to a great extent by educating the public and older residents in particular. Give older pei'sons more realistic pictures of what types of services they can expect from the police department. 3. Chronic callers. This small group of older persons may have psychological problems or may simply be lonely. They should be referred to appropriate programs-either for medical assistance or social contact, such as a telephone reassurance program staffed by older volunteers. Once a call has been taken, the police department has accepted a responsibility to do something about the problem and to satisfy the citizen, even if the call bears little relationship to traditional law enforcement, activities. Strategies For Effective Police Service Delivery' The ways and means to provide improved police service delivery to the elderly will require proac\u00ad tive organizational strategies\" These strategies should confront four problem areas: actual victimiza\u00ad tion of the elderly, older persons' fears and perceptions about victimization, attitudes toward law enforcement, and crime reporting by the elderly. Possible strategies include: Crime Analysis. Each department should collect, analyze, and disseminate the facts about local patterns and trends of the victimization of older persons. Department personnel can act only When the problems are identified. Victimization Surveys. Such surveys can augment reported victimization information to pro\u00ad vide a more realistic picture of crime problems. Surveys can also help identify barriers to crime reporting, ~he actions taken by older crime victims, and the various support services older vic\u00adtims or witnesses may need. Programs. Crime prevention programs specifically designed for older audiences and targeted to help older individuals and groups to deal with actual and perceived victimization problems should be top priority. Other programming can educate the older public about law enforcement capabilities and advocate crime reporting. Community service programs (such as Vial of Life) and safety programs can further enhance the lives of older persons. Police Training. Officers need training to understand and be able to communicate effectively with older persons in both crime and noncrime situations. When communicating with older persons, the officers may be required to spend more time than they would with younger per\u00ad sons. If comprehensive community support systems are unavailable law enforcement officers ' , 1-23 can provide the help and reassurance that some older persons, particularly those who live alone, may require. Police Operations. In order to provide effective service delivery to older persons, some depart\u00ad mental operating procedures might need to be modified. For example, if an officer is handling a service call to an older person, the department will need to recognize that he may need to spend more time on this call than standard operating procedures generally allow. Support Services. Providing support services to older persons will further the department's mis\u00ad sion, enhance the image of law enforcement, and develop stronger links among the department, older persons, and the community. Law enforcement officers should have a complet~ uI)derstanding of existing community services-they should refer older persons to these agen\u00ad ci~s and vice versa. They can also ide::ntify the need for additional support services or for changes in existing ones. Most importantly, law enforcement professionals should increase their involvement with the elderly. Organizing neighborhoods and older groups to help one another restores the older community's acceptance of their responsibilities to assist law enforce\u00ad ment. Older workers and older volunteers can help augment law enforcement. Older persons are generally available, skilled, conscientious, dependable, influential, and informed about their community; they are also, as a group, suppclrtive of the law enforcement mission. They can perform valuable community services, certain 'police services, and court services. Not only will the department and the older person derive benefits, but the community as a whole will be able to have support services which could not normally be provided through exisiting resources. Legislation. Efforts to reduce crimes against the elderly and reduce their fear of crime must be carried out at both the state and community levels. Few states, however, have made much pro\u00ad gress in implementing programs designed to deal effectively with crimes against the elderly. In view of the elderly's fear of crime and the responsibility of the state to prqtect its citizens, the Na\u00ad tional Retired Teachers Association and the American Assodation of Retired Persons advocate:29 1. Establishing comprehensive programs of indemnification to victims of crime, including restitution by the offender to the victim or the state with a prohibition against recovery of damages for injuries sustained by a perpetrator of a crime; 2. Establishing orientation services and special assistance for elderly handicapped vic\u00ad tims/witnesses to facilitate their appearances in court; 3. Sponsoring crime prevention programs aimed at increasing citizen participation in an effort to reduce crime and improve police training programs; and 4. Encouraging personnel of the criminal justice system to expand law enforcement training to in\u00ad clude segments on communicating with and understanding older persons in order to enable such personnel to deal effectively with the elderly. 1-24 . .. ~\\ ......

Again, there are no absolutes in these pro\u00ad jections but the possibility is very real. II Victim Characteristics Crime statistics over the past several years have shown a steady increase in the victimization of the elderly by certain crime types:,Many reasons are apparent for this increase, including the physiological, economic, psychological, and situational aspects of aging. Each of these factors con\u00ad tributes to the vulnerability of thi~ age group to the opportunistic crime types perpetrated upon it. As the older population increases in future years, victimization of the elderly can be expected to increase as well. This is another departure from the traditional law enforcement problems faced in America, in both the victim characteristics and the crime types perpetrated. It may also follow that additional crime types may increase against this age group, as the opportunity for victimization becomes greater. . Tax Resource Base As the American economy is impacted by a continued economic slow-down, coupled with increas\u00ad ing inflation, the resources necessary for the delivery of all services to its communities can be ex\u00ad pected to decline. This creates increasing competition among all govenimental agencies, including law enforcement, for the dwindling fiscal allocations necessary for effective service delivery. Tigh.ter budgets have already had a profound impact upon the operations of law enforcement agencies. Faced with ever-increasing demands for service and continued budget-cutting, law enforce\u00ad ment will necessarily change many traditional approaches to dealing with crime problems. Increased use of community resources for fiscal and manpower needs may become the only method of effec\u00ad tively dealing with community problems. Police Service Delivery The very nature of the law enforcement function has been steadily shifting toward one of social service delivery. The separation of crime from all other social ills within a community has always been impossible, and officers have always dealt with these myriad problems to some degree. The trend of American society, however, has been to adopt greater social responsibility for individual pro~~. ' What this social responsibility brings about is an increasing awareness and need to act upon an ever-increasing range of problems. The community mechanisms that deal with these problems have become more and more reliant upon the law enforcement officer to immediately respond and refer them to the appropriate agency. As this continues, the task of the line officer increasingly becomes one of social service delivery and referral, as opposed to strict enforcement of the laws. Arguments have surfaced that within 20 years police forces will metamorphose into police ser\u00ad vices, contracting with social services agencies fOr cooperative work.3o In actuality, the propagation of crime prevention and community relations has significantly increased the community interaction with law enforcement. This interaction is becoming a primary facilitator of social services delivery. 1-26 I I \" ba~~ea~OdU~!~~~r:e~:~~! deal less with traditional 'street crime' ~~C~~!~:~~~~creased relian~e u~on The inves~igati~e function be forced to cope with the highly sophisticated white-colI d co~puter c~lmes In fut~re years t~ a much greater degree.

SUMMARY 1. The population of America is aging, resulting in important demographic changes which will require police administrators to move away from a reactive to a proactive role. Crime is the most serious issue identified by the elderly in national surveys. Law enforcement agencies must address the \"perception of crime\" problem among the elderly in their c~m\u00ad munities, regardless of actual victimization rates. In addition, each law ~nforce~ent offIcer must understand his personal attitudes about aging in order to work effectIvely wIth the elder- ly. 2. National surveys show that the elderly are not necessarily victimized by more crime than, the rest of the population, but there are certain crime types which are more frequently committed against older persons. The causes and effects of the victimization of the elderly are compounded by the aging popula\u00ad tion's general attitudes, characteristics, and needs. Many of these attributes also increase t?e elderly person's vulnerability to crime. As the population grows older and de~~grap~Ics change, overall victimization rates, trends, and tendencies will shift. In the comm~mtlcs WhICh experience dramatic changes in the size and composition of their. older populatIOns, law en\u00ad forcement agencies will need to: (1) clearly identify crime problems; (2) accurately ass.ess the causes and effects of the victimization of the elderly; and (3) be capable of confrontmg the problem. 3. The nature of the law enforcement function ha~ been steadily shifting toward one of social ser\u00ad vice delivery, What this social responsibility brings about is the increasing need for the police to act upon an ever-increasing range of problems. The task of the line officer is becoming one of soc~al s~rvice delivery and referral, as opposed to strict enforcement of the laws. To be effectIve m the future, the police will need to rely more upon crime analysis and crime-speci~ic targ~ting, with administrators taking a leadership role to establish the parameters of the SOCIal serVIce referral function within the department. 1-28 \" .---~--~--- '.

Approximately 5,000 Americans celebrate their 65th birthday every d~.y. The net increase of older Americans is about 1,400 per day or a half million p~r year.1 The United States population is growing proportionately older. And as more and more com\u00ad munities have growing numbers of older residents, society's stereotypes and myths about aging are affecting the ability of law enforcement agencies to meet the service needs and victimization con\u00ad cerns of older citizens. Attitudes generally held about aging and personal attitudes toward one's own aging influence the manner in which services are provided. Increasing contact with the elderly affects all levels of the law enforcement agency-from the chief administrator to the records section clerk. Thus, it is critical that law p.i1forcement employees develop the ability to communicate effectively with older persons. SENSORY PERCEPTIONS Everyone relies upon sensory perceptions, constantly gathering information about the surroun\u00ad ding environment Which enables him to function with others. But, as people grow older, significant changes occur in the various sensory perceptions. These changes reduce the quantity and quality of sensory information received. As aging progresses, less sensory information is conveyed to the brain. In addition, the central processes of the brain which are responsible for interpreting the sen\u00ad sory information are progressively slowing down. Consequently, the older individual takes more time to process and react to sensory information. There is nodconsens~s about the general age at which sensory deficits begin. While the onset of a deficit may occur as early as the mid-twenties (e.g., color sensitivity generally declines in the early twenties), many sensory changes may never occur, depending on the individual. Actual aging changes differ markedly from person to person. Changes in the sensory perceptions not only begin at different ages, but will proceed at different rates. Because these changes are usually gradual, an older person may not be aware of sensory limitations; in many cases he may use his other senses or his experiential background to augment the remaining senses.2 For example, it is difficult to adjust to a loss of good vision, but the hearing sense can help compensate for this loss. However, if both of these senses begin changing at the same timer-as often happens in the process of aging-adjustment can require a great deal of emotional as well as physical energy. An older person's struggl~ to adapt and cope with .-/ changes can be frustrating and anxiety-provoking. However, most older persons successfully adjust to the effects of the aging process. By understanding the sensory perception changes that may come with aging, and how to deal with these changes in the older citizen, the law enforcement officer can provide services more effectively and with greater understanding. Whether the officer is in an interview situation with an older per\u00ad son, offering safety and security advice, or assisting an older crime victim, a knowledge of the sen\u00ad sory changes that may occur with aging and the ability to deal with these changes can make all the difference in providing good service. Vision Changes in vision related to aging vary widely from person to person. These changes are not strictly dependent upon chronological age or general health status.3 Because the eye is so con\u00ad structed that it can function efficiently even beyond the owner's lifetime, excellent vision without glasses is' sometimes maintained even in extreme old age.4 However, this is an exception. About three-fourths of all older women and over half of all older men experience moderate to severe ch.anges in visual functions. Those 65 or older comprise half of all legally blind persons in the United States.s The simple .statistical probabilities are that an older person will have vision difficulties of one kind or another. Visual functions tend to decline because of changes in the structure of the eye, diseases, and in\u00ad juries. These changes commonly affect persons 45 years of age and 0lder.6 Visual functions which may change with age include the capacity to see details, to focus at varying distances, to adjust to changes in the intensity of light or darkness, and to distinguish colors. Changes in vision will affect different people in different \u00b7ways. While some visual functions decline, others may not. The follow\u00ad ing specific visual functions will be described in detail: Visual Acuity Farsightedness Nearsightedness Focusing Ability Depth Perception Peripheral Vision Glare Resistance Dark Adaptation Color Vision Visual Acuity. The ability to discriminate fine detail when objects are placed at varying distances in commonly referred to as visual acuity, which is usually measured and expressed numerically as 20120,20140 vision and so on. For example, a person with normal 20120 vision can see letters of a given size at 40 feet, while a person with 20140 vision can see these letters only at 20 feet. The probability of losing sharp visual acuity increases as one grows older. Decline can begin in in\u00ad dividuals with normal undiseased eyes as early as the mid-twenties, and tends to accelerate in later years. About three-fourths of all women and over half of all older men have 20140 vision or po.orer,' 1-32 . . , \\; ./ .' / A loss in visual acuity affects the ability to read small print. This vision difficulty may also partly explain why some older adults are more susceptible to certain types of fraud. The victim may not want to admit his inability to read small print and therefore may sign a contract without being aware of everything in the contract. Visual acuity is seriously affected by lighting conditions. When older persons are having dif\u00ad ficulties with glare resistance or dark adaptation, they cannot see details. Even in optimum light, older persons may have trouble reading names on mailboxes and doors, labels on cans and packages, and many traffic and directional signals. An older person also may have difficulty in detecting or handling small objects. There are many ways in which law enforcement personnel can enhance visual acuity for the aged. In any written communications-letters, memos, signs, and hand-out literature-large lettering should be used. The visual field should be simplif,ij:~: focus on important information rather than adding too many details. Whenever possible, provide adequate lighting. Farsightedness. Technically known as presbyopia, farsightedness is a condition which facilitates the ability to see distant objects clearly but makes it more difficult to focus on objects at close range. Farsightedness is caused by a loss of elasticity in the lens of the eye, a fairly normal occurrence for most people as they grow older.s Inside the eye, there is a small transparent lens behind the cornea . which changes its shape to focus on objects at varying distances. Around the age of 40, the lens becomes less elastic and is unable to change shape as it once did. Vision at the usual reading distance starts to become blurry. By age 55, the lens has lost most of its flexibility, and nearly all people over that age will exhibit symptoms of farsightedness.9 When older adults are farsighted, they may have difficulty seeing close objects clearly. The law enforcement agency can assist older visitors by identifying its rooms and floors with large numerals and by marking police vehicles with large decals. In addition, school crossing guards should be pro\u00ad vided with large hand-held \"stop\" signs or dressed in very visible clothing, such as a day-glo orange jacket or vest. Because of farsightedness problems, an older woman may have greater difficulty identifying the face of a pursesnatcher, since the only opportunity she maY,have to recognize him is when he is very close. ' Conversely, the nearsighted person who experiences a loss of elasticity in the lens of the eye can expect some improvement in vision. He will be able to focus on distant objects more clearly. Nearsightedne~s. With increasing age, the eyeballs sometimes elongate, enhancing the ability to see near things more clearly than distant ones. Because of this problem, the older driver who is near\u00ad sighted may not be able to read a road sign until he is too close to follow its instructions. When the elderly are nearsighted, they may need to hold objects closely to see them clearly. Older persons are twice as likely as the rest of the popUlation to wear glasses to facilitate reading. However, simply because an older person is wearing glasses, it may not be true that he has compen\u00ad sated adequately for vision changes. The prescription may be outdated or the eyeglasses, if they are dirty, may be interfering with clear vision. When the law enforcement officer is assisting the older person who is nearsighted or farsighted, positioning is important. The most suitable distance will vary from individual to individual. Thus, . Iii MilWal4 tu4J142ib t lJ I HI \" I q , .' the officer will need to adjust his physical position and any objects, devices, or materials he wants the older person to see clearly. To do this, he must quietly test the older person's visual skills. (Methods for conducting these visual tests are explained in Module III, Lesson 1.) Focusing Ability. This visual function combines the' images seen by two eyes so that the things we see are three dimensional and in sharp outline. The ability to focus requires rapid, flexible ad\u00ad justments in the lens, so that the eye can make instant shifts in focusing from a book)n hand to a star in the sky. With increasing age, the lens loses its elasticity and it cannot adjust fo~~s rapidly on objects at varying distances. For example, the older driver cannot as rapidly f(\\>cus on the speedometer on the dashboard and then on a car 500 feet up the road or a person waUting into the roadway. In addition, many important environmental cues may dissolve into a blur,because of changes in focusing ability. Three behavioral symptoms may indicate a slowdown in the older person's focusing ability: un\u00ad controlled eye movements, inability to follow an object in motion, and slow visual coordination. An older person should not be expected to focus quickly on objects at varying distances. This will cause his eyes to tire more quickly. Whether conducting an investigation, giving directions or speak\u00ad ing to an older audience, the law enforcement officer should make every effort to facilitate the older person's focusing ability. The officer who repeatedly requires an older person to look up from a paper and over to him or across the room is draining the older person's energies; he cannot clearly follow the efforts of the officer to communicate with him. As the older person becomes aware of his focusing limitations, he begins to realize that he will not be able to see what is happening around him and that he will not be able to respond quickly to potential dangers and hazards. This can serve to increase his fear of criminal victimization. Depth Perception. Depth perception is the ability to judge the distance of objects and the spatial relationships of objects at different distances. As this ability diminishes with age, the older person can experience difficulty in buildings with long corridors. Stairways can become obstacles, par\u00ad ticularly when the risers are not distinguishable from the steps-when all the steps are painted the same color or the stairway is carpeted with a pattern or a \"busy\" print.to Crossing the street may become a slow and uncertain process. This occurs nQt only because the older person needs to judge the speed and direction of cars and the timing of traffic lights, but also because of the need to place foot movements. Bodily motions which were previously automatic now need to be carefully monitored. Climbing stairs and getting on and off of buses becomes a chore. An older person may also miss things when he is re~ching for them. In most situations, there are important environmental cues which can augment an older person's depth perception abilities. While law enforcement agency personnel cannot shorten corridors or eliminate stairs, they can, however, clearly mark floors, offices, meeting rooms, and steps. The safe\u00ad ty as well as the mobility of the older person who visits the department will be greatly enhanced. Peripheral Vision. Peripheral vision is the ability to recognize objects in the outer portion of the field of vision. The normal eye has a three-degree cone of vision in which objects appear in clear w.,_.' < / .. detail. Around the central vision are 90 degrees of peripheral vision, which is highly sensitive to mo\u00ad tion, light and darkness, and varying shapes and sizes'! 1 Figure One represents the field of both cen\u00ad tral and peripheral vision. Peripheral vision comes close to 150 degrees of the visual field. FIGURE ONE OBJECT r .......... I l _____________ . __ Peripheral vision generally begins to constrict after the age of 45 and continues its decline after age 65 with greater shrinkages.12 Shrinking peripheral vision limits the older person's ability to detect objects on either side of his line of vision-he will see only things directly in front of him. A person experiencing this change will begin to:place objects as directly in front of himself as possible. In addition, his mobility and balance may 'be less steady and certain. To illustrate, an older driver, who has been stopped for a traffic violation, will remain seated in her car as the officer approaches. The officer has been trained to stand beside the car and slightly behind the driver's seat to explain the driving violation. In this case, the violator will tend to be less cooperative and more reticent. If the officer changes his position to face the violator directly as he is speaking, he may be dealing with a more pleasant and cooperative citizen. It can be extremely frustrating for an older driver to respond to a law enforcement officer when she cannot see or understand what is going on behind her. Changes in peripheral vision limit an older person's ability to pay attention to the surrounding en\u00ad vironment. For the law enforcement officer, coping with this problem involves changing the usual practice of standing off to the side of a citizen at an angle. Whenever an officer rapidly or unex\u00ad pectedly approaches an older person, he should use verbal reinforcement to avoid frightening the person. He should try to face the older person as directly as possible. Whether talking with an older individual or addressing a group of senior citizens, the officer should keep them positioned directly in front of himself. Glare Resistance. The eye's sensitivity to the intensity of light and darkness changes with age. Beginning around the age of 40, this change affects a person's ability to adjust to bright light. Older persons generally experience a lowered glare resistance. With age, the lens of the eye becomes more . opaque and glare causes discomfort. Glare can be either direct or diffuse. Direct glare comes from a concentrated light source such as car headlights or sunlight reflecting off a store window. Diffuse glare refers to the overall intensity 1-35 , of light, a common problem on bright days after a snowfall.~3 Glare is ~ ser~ous problem which ca~ be partially controlled by the use of tinted eyeglass lenses or tmted glass m wmdows. However, these devices do not always solve the problem- they may cut off the light level too much for the aged. Because of lowered glare resistance, an older person may not. be able to immediately recognize a law enforcement officer standing in the bright sunlight outside his door. Squinting eyes can be a signal of possible problems with glare resistance. Tinted glasses or eyeshades help the older person compensate for his lowered resistance to glare. Lighting conditions constantly affect\" visual perceptions. In circumstances of uncontrolled natural light (such as a sunny or bright, snowy day, or when in a room n~a~ a .large win?o~), ol~er persons can experience problems with glare. There are many ways to mmlmlze glare mSlde bUlldmgs for older persons; for example, curtains can be pulled, seating can be arra?ged so that older perso?s are not facing the incoming sun, and meetings can be held duri~g the time of day when glare IS not prevalent. When dealing with the older person o~ the stre,et,. It may be helpful for the law enforce\u00ad ment officer to invite him into the patrol car or mto a bUlldmg. In artificial light, the older eye functions more comfortably under incandescent (yello,w) ligh~s than tmder fluorescent (blue) lights. Larger wattage electric bulbs (150 watts) usually prOVide suffi\u00ad cient light without producing problems with glare. Shiny materials, or even glossy paper, create glare problems for older persons. Dark Adaptation. The older person will have difficulty seeing at night long before?e notices that he is having problems during the day. This problem is caused by the fact that the dl~meter of the pupil decreases with age, thus allowing less light to enter the eye.14 As a result, the a~m~ ~ye ?e~ds more light to see well. In a dimly lighted environment, for example, an older person s VISion IS Im\u00ad pe;ded and the potential for accidents increases. The eyes of an older person may also require a longer period of time to adjust from light to darkness. Driving at night, for example, can be a problem because sight recovery after exposure to oncoming headlights is delayed. On the average it takes five seconds for the normal eye to fully recover from bright light to dim light. It takes several seconds longer for the older adult. IS An exam\u00ad ple is an older person who returns home, enters, and gradually. perceives th~t ,a ~urglary ~as been committed. How long would it take to react? How fear-provokmg would thIS mCldent be. There are no devices presently available that will improve this condition in the older eye. A delicate balance is required-getting enough light to the eye while preventing glare. 16 The law enforcement officer who cannot control the light should allow for extra adjustment ti~e when escorting an older person from one light intensity level to another: For ~xample, ~hen entermg or leaving a darkly lighted church, movie theater, or home, a person With agmg eyes wdl tak~ 10,n~er to adjust. The officer should wait several minutes befo~e requ~ring the older ~erso~ t~ use hiS vIsion again. The police department can also take corrective action to m~k~ ItS b~ddl~gs. more ac\u00ad comodating to the needs of older visitors: for example, entrances and eXits m publIc bUlldmgs can be hazardous to the elderly and could create momentary confusion-o~der pe~s?ns may trip o~er ste~s as they adjust to dramatic changes in the intensity of light. PolIce offiCials can examme their building under different lighting conditions and correct any problems that could be hazardous to older visitors. 1-36 I . , -~-----------:~\".........,.,,~-.-~-----------:----------------- :) , . \\ ~ Color Vision. The ability to see and idenldfy different vivid colors changes whh age. The lens of the eye actually yellows with age, thus reduc:ing the quality of light entering the eye and filtering out colors.l ? When this occurs, all colors tend to fade, with red fading the least. Blue colors fade most and tend to merge into greens. Thus, the older person may have difficulty distinguishing the boun\u00ad dary between green carpeting and a blue wall. Boundaries are also unstable for the older person when inte1llsely contrasting colors are used next to each other: for example, hot red and bright green will seem to vibrate. Such colors used on a wall and on an adjacent staircase create a hazard for the elderly.l8 Loss of color vision can have more serious consequenses for the older person. Some traffic signs can fade into the background if color contrasts are not strong. 19 The older pedestrian who hesitates before crossing at an intersection may be having difficulty seeing a green traffic light against a blue sky. Color blindness, on the other hand, is not age-related. This tendency generally is inherited. While most people perceive three primary colors, those who have red-green color blindness only see yellows and blues. They tend to confuse reds, blue-greens, and grays. The color vision change process for older persons is comparable to viewing the world through yellow-tinted lenses. The law enforcement officer should be aware that this problem can affect significant perceptions. For example, older victims and witnesses may be unable to provide correct descriptions of the colors of cars or clothing. , In addition, older persons may not be able to see clearly many environmental cues and signficant boundaries, such as traffic signs, directional signals, and even patrol cars. Weather conditions and seasons can also affect the color vision abilities of the elderly. , . The effective use of crime prevention displays and hand-out literature can be maximized by using high contrast colors (intense color contrast selections, such as red or green, are as troublesome as a harmonious color selection, such as green on blue). To create a high color. contrast comfortable to the eyes of older persons, use a black or dark brown print on an off-white or white background. The eyes of an older person may also require a longer period of time to adjust from light to darkness. Driving at night, for example, can be a problem because sight recovery after exposure to oncoming headlights is delayed. On the average it takes five seconds for the normal eye to fully recover from bright light to dim light. It takes several seconds longer for the older adult. IS An exam\u00ad ple is an older person who returns home, enters, and gradually perceives that a burglary has been committed. How long would it take to react? How fear-provoking would this inciden.t be? There are no devices presently available that will improve this condition in the older eye. A delicate balance is required-getting enough light to the eye while preve~ting glare.16 The law enforcement officer who cannot control the light should allow for extra adjustment time when escorting an older person from one light intensity level to another. f'or3Jxample, when entering or leaving a darkly lighted church, movie theater, or home, a person with aging eyes will take longer to adjust. The officer should wait several minutes before requiring the older person to use his vision again. The police department can als'o take corrective action to make its buildings more ac\u00ad comodating to the needs of older visitors: for example, entrances and exits in public buildings can be hazardous to the elderly and could create momentary confusion--older persons may trip over steps 1-37 as they adjust to dramatic ch~nges in the intensity of light. Police officials can examine their building under different lighting conditions and correct any problems' that could be hazardous to older visitors. Color Vision. The ability to see and identify different vivid colors changes with age. The lens of . the eye actually yellows with age, thus reducing the quality of light entering the eye and filtering out colors.17 When this occurs, all colors tend to fade, with red fading the least. Blue colors fade most and tend to merge into greens. Thus, the older person may have difficulty distinguishing the boun\u00ad dary between green carpeting and a blue wall. Boundaries are also unstable for the older person when intensely contrasting colors are used next to each other: for example, hot red and bright green will seem to vibrate. Such colors used on a wall and on an adjacent staircase create a hazard for the elderly.l8 Loss of color vision can have more serious consequenses for the older person. Some traffic signs can fade into the background if color contrasts are not strong.19 The older pedestrian who hesitates before crossing at an intersection may be having difficulty seeing a green traffic light against a blue sky. Color blindness, on the other hand, is not age-related. This tendency generally is inherited. While .most people perceive three primary colors, those who have red-green color blindness only see yellows and blues. They tend to confuse reds, blue-greens, and grays. The color vision change process for older persons is comparable to viewing the world through yellow-tinted lenses. The law enforcement officer should be aware that this problem can affect significant perceptions. For example, older victims and witnesses may be unable to provide correct description,s of the colors of cars or clothing. In addition, older persons may not be able to see clearly many environmental cues and signficant boundaries, such as traffic signs, directional signals, and even patrol cars. Weather conditions and seasons can also affect the color vision abilities of the elderly. The effective use of crime prevention displays and hand-out literature can be maximized by using high contrast colors (intense color contrast selections, such as red or green, are as troublesome as a harmonious color selection, such as green on blue). To create a high color contrast comfortable to the eyes of older persons, use a black or dark brown print on an off-white or white background. Some high contrast color selections will not be easy for an older person to read, such as white print on a dark blue background. Law enforcement officers should consider readability as well as contrast when developing cr~rne prevention program visual materials. /1 ,. Severe Vision Problems. In addition to the common vision changes related to aging, the law en\u00ad forcement officer will encounter some older persons who are experiencing severe vision pro\u00ad blems-low vi~ion, blindness, and even visual hallucinations. Many definitions of \"low vision\" exist among various federal and state agencies.20 In most states, a person is considered legally blind if, with the best eye, he can see no more at a distance of 20 feet than a person with normal sight can see at a distance of 200 feet.21 Blindness does not necessarily 1-38 .. ~, ... , . mean a complete absence of light perception (totally blind). It may mean being unable to read newpaper print or being unable to see weB enough to work (functionally blind).22 Blindne,ss is the tot~l inability to see because of visual loss brought on by disease or injury or total degen.er~tlOn of functJo~. Over half of the newly reported cases of blindness each year are persons aged ~5 and over. Of thIS, more than 80 percent are 70 years of age or 01der.23 Cataracts, glaucoma, and dIabetes are the three greatest threats to vision and the commonest causes of blindness in the older person, Cataracts affect the lens of the eye, changing it from clear to cloudy. Cataracts are rare before the ?ge o~ 50 and, occu~ almost universally after the age of 70,24 The first signs of a cataract are trouble 10 se,emg detaIl, seeI~g better in twilight than in daylight or in bright light, or seeing double or triple or dIm and blurred Images,25 Cataracts still transmit light, but filter out all visual detail. This vision difficulty is surgically treatable. The operation consists of removing the cataract under gener~l or loc~l anestMsia. The surgeon will either put in a plastic lens, or, after the eye has healed, preSCrIbe sp/!cIallenses, The success rate is 75 to 80 percent and it would probably be higk~t:r if more cases were treated early.26 , Glauco?Ia,i~ a most ~erious ey~ condition among chances of developing glaucoma mcrease sIgmfIcantly ~Ith age, Nmety percent of all caSes occur in persons 40 years old or 01der.27 ~laucoma is characterized by increased fluid pressure inside the eye because normal fluid d~~mage has been obstructed,28 The fluid pressme becomes too high and causes progressive harm to VISIon, There are two types of glaucoma: wide-angle and narrow-angle. Wide-angle glaucoma develops slowly over a period of years and is not characterized by pain until total blindness has resulted. Narrow-angle glaucoma generally occurs in the fifties and sixties, more often in ',Yomen than in men. It--,comes with little or no warning, and is characterized by sudden acute at$~ks. of blurred vision, ra~nbow-colored halo vision, redness of the eye, and pain. Recurrenj,~'t\\:2',~des can lead to blIndness,29 ..... ' .. Gl~uc?ma its,elf can' be controlled, although vision which has been lost cannot be restored. MedIcatIon, or 10 some cases surgery, are used to regulate this disease. It ~s also common for older persons to suffer from visual hallucinations. Most people .have perceIved something which, upon closer inspection, was not at all what it first appeared to be. It is not uncommon for persons in their fifties to \"see\" floating spots. This does not necessarily mean that there is visual impairment, but \"floaters\" can be somewhat aggravating. Older persons ex\u00ad periencing changes in their vision may see moving shapes and shadows in their fields of vision usdually this cause~ no particular problem. However, if the person is confused, disoriented, isolated: un er severe emotIonal stress, or affected by some medications, these visual impressions can resem\u00ad ble frig~t~ning visual hallucin~tions.30. This phenomenon may serve to increase feelings of vulnerabIlIty to ~anger and to crIme.3) NIght can also create special problems for the older person. ~ completely OrIented person can seem to be disoriented at night if he is undergoing changes in vi\u00ad SIon. In more severe cases, the older person may become so disoriented that he wanders away from friends, family, or familiar places. ':0 , 'I 11 d 1 :1 '( Misperception causes special problems to which law enforcement officers must'resPPild. Without adequate sight, an older person must rely a great deaJ on past experience to interpret his surroun\u00ad dings. For example, an. older person may' 'see\" a shape or shadow moving outside his bedroom win\u00ad dow. It is very easy for him to perceive this \"shadow\" as a \"prowier\"\" Although there may be no prowler-or even a real shadow-the fear experienced by the person is very real. Often the police are called to the homes of older persons to check for prowlers. The officer should c()nduct a careful check and then take the time to reassure the older person that tpe prowler is gone. The officer should never tell an older person that he is \"just imagining things\". Not only is this poor police\u00ad community relations, but such an attitude could also cause the older person to hesitate before call\u00ad ing the police the next time he hears a noise outside his window-and that may be the one time there actually is a prowler. Older persons who undergo severe changes in vision may be materially helped by agencies qualified to assist them. Skills F'or Dealing With Vision Changes Widely varying vision changes occur with age. There can be changes in visual acuity, far\u00ad sightedness, nearsightedness, focusing ability, d~pth perception, peripheral vision, glare resistance, dark adaptation, and color vision. Blindness in old age often results from glaucoma, cataracts, and diabetic complications. The older person who has uncontrolled eye movements, squinting eyes, slow visual coordination, inaccurate discrimination of detail, or high intensity color selections probably has vision problems. He may also have shrinking peripheral vision or changing depth perception. It is important for the law enforcement officer to remember that older persons are not alike. They are individuals with different cultural backgrounds, unique personalities, and different physical and emotional needs, problems and strengths. The suggestions described below must be adapted by the officer to meet the individual needs of each older person he encounters. Verbal Reinforcement. The officer should always tell the older person who he is and what he is doing. This technique can help offset most vision changes and is a good general rule for the of\u00ad ficer to follow whenever he comes into contact with an older person. Simplify Visual Field. The officer should keep the visual field as simple as possibll~ to help the older person distinguish the message he wishes to communicate. For example, a handout with too many details or an overhead transparency containing too much information can confuse rather than communicate clearly to an elderly audience. Use Clear Lettering. When commlUlicatirl! in writing with older persons, law enforcement of\u00ad ficers should use large, well-spaced lettering (letters, memos, or signs). Use High-Contrast Colors. By selecting high contrast colors for written materials and en\u00ad vironmental cues, officers can, help the older person who may have color vision and depth perception problems. Facilitate Focusing Ability. Officers who are presenting crime prevention programs to older au\u00ad diences should allow longer viewing times for audio-visual materials, such as slides or posters. . ,., .-, . \" I ~he elderly r~quire ~ore time t~ identify designs, words, and pictures. The aging eye has dif\u00ad fl~U~ty. ~ocusmg rap~dly on objects or persons at varying distances without soon tiring. By mmlmlzmg such ra~l? eye .mo~ement activities, the officer who is communicating with groups of older persons, glVlng dIrections, or conducting an interview, will find that his audience is able to respond more effectively. ' Provide Suitable Lighting. Lighting conditions affect the vision perception abilities of older ~ersons. Natural and ~rtif~cialligh~ can create problems with glare resistance and dark adapta\u00ad tion. Whether the offIcer IS speakmg. to an older person on the street or inside a building, he should attempt to control glare and gIve the older person time to adjust to changes in the level of lighting. Positi?ning. T?e o~ficer will need to .adjust his proximity to suit the older person's visual c~paclty ,espeCIally If the older person IS nearsighted or farsighted. The officer should position hlmse~f clearly within the older person's field of vision and arrange objects, devices, ,or mf~tenals so that they can be seen clearly. The same principle applies to older groups. Officers conducting crime prevention meetings should adjust seating arrangements and presentations to compensate for thtl constrictirig peripheral vision of older persons. Positioning also assists older persons with changes in visual acuity and focusing ability. . These techniques to compensate for vision losses can enhance the older persnn's ability to express hIS ne~ds and concerns to law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement practitioners will find that by applymg these techniques, their activities will be more effective and provide more satisfactory results. Hearing Hearing ~mpairment. is America's most common chronic disorder, yet most people are not aware of ho~ the~r own he:armg may be affecting their ability to communicate. 32 Hearing loss may be the m?st Isolatmg sense loss that occurs. Communication is a basic need and 'the spoken word is our pnme means of communication. Since our ability to hear affects our ability to understand the spee~h of others and t? m~nito~ our voices, a hearing loss can dramatically affect our ability to com\u00ad mUDlcate. A person WIth a hearmg loss 'may speak unnecessarily loudly or may not speak clearly. He may not react to a verbal message or a sudden noise and he may even have a reduced attention span. It has been estimated that a loss of hearing in one or both ears significantly affects one in four per\u00ad sons over age 60. However, this condition is found to affect men more often than it does women.33 Unless an individual is wearing a hearing aid, a hearing impairment may at first go unnoticed. ~ ,\"Normal\" hearing has been defined as the ability to recognize comfortably all the distinguishing n:atures of speech under usual hearing conditions- normal conversation presents no problem. Some ?ld~r persons w~o misund~rstand what is being said during a \"normal\" conversation may be expenencm~ ~ subtle Imbalance 10 their hearing ability or a mild hearing loss. They can tune in ~learly on specifiC sounds, although they cannot hear some others. A person with this type of hear- 109 loss can even be unaware that he does not hear everything. Other people are more conscious of an indi-vidual's hearing ~oss than is the person who is suffering the loss. The hearing-impaired person may gIve an understandmg nod when, in reality, he has not heard what is being said. He may answer 1-41 i\\ f()lalimud ! \\ t ,I,)'\" . riatel or answer when no question has been asked. He may have problems loc~ting and ~~:~~~~fng so:nds; noises down the hall may seem to be coming from only a few feet e,way. Older persons who experience an overall distortion of practically all sounds have a moderate hear\u00ad ing loss. They are well aware of their inability to hear clearly.34 With severe heari~g loss, older pers?ns hear fsou~dS b~t !~~~!U!~!~::~~~~e:~:dm~~:~i~:! that words be repeated.

'\"\\ ' Hearing loss resulting in a distortion of sounds generally is caused by changes in the inner ear. The two major causes affecting an elderly person's ability to hear clearly are presbycusis and Meniere's syndrome,. Presbycusis is permanent hearing impairment brought on by hardening of the inner ear bones. It cannot be medically or surgically treated. When presbycusis occurs; both ears are usually af\u00ad fected-and to the same degree. This results in a diminution in the ability to hear the loudness and the clarity of sound, and may result in slowing of signals going from the ears to the brain.37 N() definite cause for Meniere's syndrome has been identified, although many experts feel that it stems from allergies, trauma, or diabetes. Persons with Meniere's syndrome experience hearing loss, equilibrium difficulties, a feeling of fullness in the ear, anda loud, low-pitched tinnitus (head noise). The balance problem, in particular, can ir?!capacitate an individual for short periods of time. The ef\u00ad fects of Meniere's syndrome may last only a few moments or they can persist for days or weeks at a time. In severe cases, Meniere's syndrome is surgically treatable. Too often, presbycusis or Meniere's syndrome is used to explain the hea.ring loss problems of older persons. However, a variety of other underlying causes may be associated\u00b7 with hearing loss, such as: inflammatory diseases (allergies); viral disorders (measles, mumps, and including quinine, certain antibiotics (neomycin, streptomycin), and diuretics; a traumatic injury or a 110ise trauma (prolonged exposure to loud continuous noise or brief exposure to a loud impulse noise); metabolic disorders (diabetes); vascular insufficiencies (arteriosclerosis); system (multiple sclerosis).38 A somewhat disturbing change-called \"tinnitus\"-sometimes accompanies the variQus underly\u00ad ing causes of hearing loss. Tinnitus is a condition in which the older person suffers from \"head noises\" or ringing in the ear. The noise disturbances can range from buzzing to clicking to roaring to crackling sounds in the ear. The condition may be temporary 'or permanent depending upon the degree of the impairment involved. It may be caused by such factors as medication (large doses of aspirin), by hypertension, or even by a blow to the head. This is a condition that must be diagnosed by specialists. The disorder can be treated by surgery or alleviated by a simple change in diet. Sometimes hearing aids are helpful. Those who do not benefit from these trrtments can gain some relief from special \"masking devices\" to screen the noises.39 Volume. D~Jing trye early and middle adult years, hearing loss usually is minimal. As people age, however, they Ihay\"hegin to note a reduction in their ability to hear sounds as loud as they truly are or to hear sounds with complete clarity. It is important that the distinction between these two hear\u00ad ing abilities is understood~ The healthy normal ear can detect very faint sounds and, at the same time, can tolerate extremely loud sounds. Hearing impairments may lead to a reduced ability to hear the fainter sounds or speech of normal loudness. Losing the ability to hear faint background sounds has a psychological ef\u00ad fect-the older person may tend to feel removed from things happening around him. Depending ~pon the degree and kind of hearhlg impairment, some older individuals may not hear their names being called from across a room, or hear a horn blaring a warning. Generally, when an older person has simply lost the ability to hear the intensity or volume of 1-43 . sou.nds, he has still retained the ability to hear the clarity of words, even though the loudness fades. Simply speaking louder to him will enable him to hear clearly. However, a law enforcement officer will want to avoid giving the impression that he is reprimanding or \"speaking down\" to an older person. A hearing aid can make sounds louder or more intense although it cannot entirely c(Jmpensat~ for a loss, especially when the loss concerns hearing clarity. However, even for the ~lder pers~n Wlt~ a clarity hearing loss, a hearing aid can often provide a great deal of help by simply makmg famt sounds louder. Older persons are 13 times more likely to wear a hearing aid than the general populatio.n, b~t evidence suggests that older persons are less likely to get satisfactory'performance from a hearmg ald than other age groups.40 A hearing aid makes all sounds louder-those a person wants to hear ~nd those he doesn't want to hear. The concentration which is required to block out unimportant nOIses and background sounds must be relearned by the user of a hearing aid. Many older persons will not wear hearing aids, or they do not know how to operate hearing aids properly. Some older persons with hearing aids do no~ rec~gn~z~ ~hen the batteries have ~eak~ned. When communicating with a person who wears a hearmg aid, It IS Important to let the hearmg aId do its work' this is facilitated by not shouting. Officers presenting crime prevention programs to older audienc~s should also be aware that microphones can distort speech when the listeners are wearing hearing aids. Hearing Level. Hearing is generally measured by determining the level where sound can just b~re\u00ad ly be heard across the range of seven different pitches. This level is called the \"threshol~ of .acUlty\" or \"hearing level.\" \"Hearing level\" explains a surprising phenomenon occurnng molder persons who have hearing impairments. In such cases, soft sounds are inaudi?le an~ loud sounds ~c\u00ad tually sound louder. 41 Thus, the only sounds which are at the older person s hearmg level are. diS\u00ad turbingly loud. Since some older persons with Ithis problem cannot easily tolerate sounds or VOIces, they ;ill complain that \"you are speaking too loudly\" or that \"you are hurting my ears.\" Some might even say, \"Don't shout at me ... I'm not deaf!\" This condition presents difficulties for both the hearing impaired and those who are trying to communicate with that person.42 Loud speech may cause discomfort because sounds that the person has little trouble hearing are made too loud in an attempt to amplify those sounds he has trouble hearing. (Some hearing aids can be custom-designed specifically to compensate for certain hearing losses.) Clarity. Hearing impairments may also lead to a distortion of sound; the older person might com\u00ad plain, \"I can hear you, but I can't understand you.\" Anyone who has listened to an old, scratchy recording of a song or to a radio with poor sound quality understands that no matter how lou~ the volume is turned up, the words just do not come across clearly. Similarly, for the older pers~n Wlt~ a hearing impairment a loss in the ability to distinguish among the various sounds or a loss m clanty results in speech so~nding muffled or fuzzy no matter how loudly the message is delivered. Crucial to the ability to hear clearly is the ability to hear the pitch of sounds.43 The normal ear can detect sounds across a very wide pitch range, from very low to very high sound frequencies. So long as a person's hearing is normal or nearly normal across the pitch range encompassing the sound~ of speech, clarity is preserved. With age, some people lose their hearing in only a portion of the pitch c:;;:A they continue to hear certain sounds normally but fail to hear higher-pitched sounds. (A decline in the abiktty to hear low-pitched sounds occurs less frequently.) Older persons who have this problem do not hear clearly because they do not hear many key sounds in the English language, such as (f), (g), (t), (q)p (th), (sh), and others. Thus it is easy to misunderstand such words as shot much hush, thin, saw, fifty, and hundreds of single-syllable and more complicated words containi~g high~ pitched sounds. TIO miss a key sound in a word can change a key word in a sentence' thus the listener misunderstands the entire sentence. Older persons with this type of hearing loss ~i11 a~pear to hear but usually they miss large parts of the conversation because they misunderstand much of what is betng said.44 Most people have experienced verbal confusion, or misunderstanding words that sound alike when they are taken out IOf context-words like che(;.;e, sees, these. Changes in the ability to hear the pitch of sound can increase the amount of verbal confusion. Thus, police officers need to make cer\u00ad tain that their words are dearly communicated to the elderly. Increasing the volume will not help a person who has lost the ability to hear high-pitched sounds. In fact, when an officer increases the volume of his voice in response to a person who cannot hear the pitch of his voice tends to rise. On the other hand, a whisper lowers the pitch of the voice. Con~ sequently, the older person having difficulties with high-pitched sounds may hear more clearly when the officer whispers to him rather than shouts.4s Similarly, an elderly person with this kind of hear\u00ad ing change will more easily understand a man than a women or child because the man usually has a lower-pitched voice. ~olice officers often have phone conversations with people who cannot hear well. If shouting does not seem to enhance understanding, then perhaps whispering or lowering the pitch of the voice will help. For the older person who has problems distinguishing sounds, this difficulty can result in feelings of defeat, frustration, anger, embarrassment, anxiety, 'and withdrawal. The reactions are very real. An inability to hear and understand what others are saying can be terribly isolating. For example, when an older person is attempting to answer questions or follow directions given by a police of\u00ad ficer, the officer may notice that the older person is becoming anxious as he tries to follow the con\u00ad versation. The officer, himself, may become anxious as he constantly repeats what he is saying so that the older person will understand him. Finally, the older listener may become frustrated and angrily respond, \"Why don't you speak mOire plainly!\" Gradually, though, the older person with an inability to distinguish sounds clearly begins to avoid such frustrating situations and becomes withdrawn when in the presence of strangers. Officers should be aware that it is very difficult for the hearing impaired to call in a crime report; police dispatchers need to be trained to recognize when the person calling in a report is hearing impaired so that they can respond properly. Another problem arises if the older person does not admit he cannot hear clearly or does not ap\u00ad pear to be confused. The officer may mistakenly assume that his message was communicated clear\u00ad ly. When an older person not only has an inability to hear most sounds loudly enough but also has an inability to hear most sounds clearly enough, the problem is complicated. Loud speech in this case may make the problem worse because it makes everything louder, and the sounds remain distorted. \" ! , I ; I ': i 11 \\1 Ii \\ U h j f I If a person has lost all hearing and has hand mobility enough to write, a chalk slate or pad and pencil are the best means of communicating with him. Police ~fficers must us~ time and patience to effectively communicate with people who have problems heanng clearly. Offlcers must repeat and rephrase messages so that they can gradually be understood (remember, the listener has to expend a great deal of effort and energy as well). Background Noise. Everyone has the ability to selectively hear one sound from among a group of sounds. For example, a person can often hear the doorbell ring over a backgrou~d of m~sic and conversation. But there are definite limits to this ability. Unwanted sounds and nOlses can mterfere with hearing what a person wants to hear. The ability to hear clearly is significantly affected by background noise. Research has shown that when speech is presented clearly with a minimum of extraneous noise, there is little or no impair\u00ad ment noted. However, as background noise is added, hearing loss accelerates quickly. A person's ability to understand speech in the presence of background noise begins to deteriorate at about age 30 and it declines steadily thereafter. Noises from television, appliances, music, traffic, airplanes, subways, air-conditioning, and crowded places (for example, restaurants and theaters) interfere with hearing what one wants to hear. Generally, older persons experience difficulty in separating background n~ises fron,t the speech or sounds they want to hear. The reason for this is that the background nOlse con tams many low\u00ad pitched sounds. These background sounds interfere with the older person's ability to hea~ the low\u00ad pitched speech jumbled and mixe~ ~ith t~e bac~gro~~d nOlse. Most people with hearing great dlfflculty m th~lr ablhty t.o hear con\u00ad versations while they are in noisy places. The hearing loss caused by the nOlse results m a gre~ter overall hearing difficulty. Persons with hearing losses of high-pitched sounds can get along fauly well in quiet listening situations. The very nature of this kind of hearing loss can lead to inconsistent behavior. Because ~any sounds are heard normally, the older person will respond at times to faint commands and questlOns. However, at other times he may misunderstand what is being said and give an incorrect reply to a question or fail to respond at all. Such people are sometimes mistakenly considered to be stubborn, slow, uncooperative, or even mentally dull. Frequently, we will hear someone say, \"Dad's hearing isn't so bad; he always seems to hear what he wants to hear.\" While there are times when a hearing loss of this type can appear to work to one's advantage, the listening problems associated with the inability to hear high~pitched sounds are difficult for others to understand and tolerate.46 The law enforcement officer who is speaking with an older person on the street, or even in a noisy! area of the police building, should try to establish a quiet listening environment. It is easier for the older person to understand him if background noises are minimized. Officers should also speak more slowly when talking to older people. The older person may hear words clearly, but be unable to make any sense out of words that come at t?O r~pid a pace. '~he words are a meaningless jumble of sounds, almost as if the person were hstemng to a forelgn language. 1-46 ;'/ . . \" / l \\ Skills For Dealing With Hearing Changes Hearing impairment has many causes and there are several problems that result from it. The more difficult it is for a 'person to hear with his ears, the more he relies upon other skills for com\u00ad municating. People with normal hearing will naturally watch a speaker's face and lips more careful\u00ad ly in a noisy place and concentrate heavily on what is being said in order to follow the conversation. But a person who suffers from a hearing loss must take advantage of every opportunity to use other skills in communicating, such as speechreading. Speechreading, often thought of only as lipreading, is the process of visually receiving cues from all lip movements, fa,cial expressions, body postures and gestures, and the environment. Speechreading is a skill that everyone has to a certain degree. It is only when hearing becomes impaired that this skill becomes so important. When he en\u00ad counters a hearing impaired person, an officer will need to provide cues and gestures to support speech reading by the listener and to reinforce his efforts at communicating. 47 The officer will be able to communicate most effectively and patiently with hearing impaired peo\u00ad ple by following these suggestions: Reinforce and Rephrase. Whenever possible, give a clue to the topic of the conversation. If the o,lder person does not appear to understand What is being said, rephrase the statement in short, slmple sentence~. Do not repeat the whole sentence. Some persons with a hearing loss are undu\u00ad ly sensitive about their handicap and they pretend to understand when they don't. An officer who detects this situation should tactfully repeat his meaning in different words until it gets across. He should use gestures and objects to reinforce his message. Gain Attention. An officer should wait until he is visible to the older person before speaking. Attract the older person's attention first by facing him and looking straight into his eyes, or by touching his hands or shoulders lightly. Arrange the environment so that the speaker's face and body can be seen easily and clearly. Good lighting on the speaker's face is important-facial ex\u00ad pressions, gestures, and lip and body movements serve to illustrate the verbal message. Chew\u00ad ing, eating, or covering the mouth with hands or a piece of paper minimize effective com\u00ad munication. Positioning. The best distance when speaking to an older person is from 0.9m to 1.8m (3 feet to 6 feet). Speaking. The officer should carefully monitor his speaking voice for volume, pitch, pace, and enunciation. Speak slightly louder than normal. However, shouting may sometimes distort the message; the voice should be kept at about the same volume throughout each sentence and should not be dropped at the end of the sentence. A low-pitched voice is often easier to hear; older persons may have difficulty understanding the high-pitched voices of women and children. Speak at a moderate pace, but make the change to a new subject, a new name, a number, or an unusual word at a slower rate. Do not exaggerate sounds when speaking; this disorts the message and makes visual cues from the face difficult to understand. Control Noise. Communication wi,th the hearing impaired older person is much more difficult when there is a great deal of environmental noise. On the other hand, rooms which have sound- 1-47 ? ifAQ J proofing that minimizes background noises may not be suitable for the elderly; some combina\u00ad tions of carpeting, acoustical ceiling material, and drapes make hearing clearly almost impossi\u00ad ble. Encourage Participation. Encourage the older person to communicate. Because the hearing im\u00ad paired elderly take longer to respond, give them enough time to answer a question. In many ways a hearing loss can have a greater impact than a loss of vision. Many people seem to have less patience and sympathy for those who cannot hear well than they do for those with vision impairments. Because of this, people with hearing losses may pretend to understand. Hearing loss is very strongly related to feelings of depression and suspicion. 54 The isolation that can result from a declining ability to communicate detracts from the quality of life. By using the skills that help offset these hearing changes, an officer can communicate more effectively with those who need to understand and be understood. PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF AGING Physiological changes which occur as part of the p~ocess of aging include declines in muscular strength and dexterity, changes in the organ systems, and changes in the skeletal system of joints and bones. As a result of these normal aging changes, older person will become less mobile, more susceptible to serious physical damage from injuries and falls, and generally will require more time to compen\u00ad sate for these physiological changes. In addition, normal physiological changes may disturb an older person's sleep patterns or may contribute to emotional, social, and physiological isolation prob\u00ad lems. In some instances, these normal physiological changes make the elderly person more vulnerable to injury if they are attacked by criminals. Law enforcement officers should also be aware that a simple activity like crossing a street can become a serious problem, fraught with risks, for an elderly person whose mobility has decreased and whose balance, or position sense, has been reduced with age. If law enforcement officers are aware of these physiological changes that occur in the elderly, they can then recommend appropriate precautions that will reduce the risk of injuries-recommenda\u00ad tions that will make the everyday environment of the elderly safer and more secure. Muscular System Maximum muscular strength normally occurs between the ages of 25 and 30. After the age of 30, however, the individual usually shows a gradual decline in physical strength and speed.48 This occurs partly because, as a person ages, the muscles begin to deteriorate. While muscle loss is normal and typical for the elderly, the greatest loss occurs in inactive people. Muscular strength will waste away from disuse. What is the consequence? At age 80, the average muscular strength in males is approxi\u00ad mately the same as that of 12 year-old boys.49 The older person's inability to maintain higher muscular activity relates to reduced muscle mass, a decline in nerve activity, a slower rate of chemical reactions, and reduced blood supply.50 Even in a f I \" .-1-48 . . \" o \" ' , / resting state, the older person will show a decline in the following physiological functions: nerve im\u00ad pul~e speed, cardiac output, blood flow and filtration rate, basic metabolism, and sex hormone ex\u00ad cretIOn. A weak handshake or the inability to button clothes are commonplace clues to the lessening of muscular strength and 'dexterity in an elderly person. Rapid, voluntary muscular movements, such as those required to flee from a criminal will be even more .difficult and ,require additional time and effort on the part of an ,older perso~. Older . muscles f~tIgue more easIly. As an overall result, one can expect to encounter in the elderly a general decrease m strength, endurance, and agility.51 Organ Systems The older adult will usually be slower, weaker and more easily fatigued since many older people confront different rates of aging in various organ systems. 52 As an example, the same individual may possess a c~:np~~at~velY.\"YOuthful\" cardiovascular system, a relatively \"middle-aged\" skeletal system, and an. old dIgestIve system. However, a slowdown in one system usually creates strains and energ~ drams on the other parts of the body., During the aging process, all organ systems lose cells and tIssues that are not replaced. The physiological pattern of change beginning in the forties is a gradual reduction in the performance of many organ systems.53 Organ s.ystems generally do not deteriorate rapidly. Moreover, the body initially possesses more cells and tIss~es than are n~cessary for survival. For these reasons, many of the declines in the organ systems go VIrtually unnotIced. One of the first changes to be noticed is the dramatic reduction of the body's tremendous reserve capacities, which are used whenever illness or emotional upsets arise. The elderly's recovery rate-the time it takes for the system to replenish its reserves-is also slower. Because of th~s~ changes. occurring in the organ systems, an injury can create special problems for the elderly. An mJury can mclude bumps, bruises, breaks, and abrasions, most often affecting the outer surface o~.t~~ body. F~r .the elderly, physical injury can become an important contributory fact?r to the debIlItIes of age; mJury can transform the gradual physiological declines accompanying age mto sudden reductions. More often, injury will decrease the older person's reserve capacities. Skeletal System . A .pers~n's bones and joints make up the major parts of the body's skeletal system. Changes oc\u00ad cur m th~s system, too, as part of the process of aging. Joints slowly and inevitably undergo ~egeneratlv~ changes and stiffen and degenerative joint disease is not unusual; it is present in vary\u00ad mg. degrees m many people. The onset of degenerative joint disease is characterized by stiff joints ~hICh a pers~n can feel after sitting for a long period of time. Later, mild pain may develop, which IS ~sually n~tlc~d .only when s~anding? w?lking, or making any movements which involve using the ~elght-bearmg Jomts. Severe mcapacltatIOn from degenerative joint disease will be found in about fIve percent of the older population. 54 , Bones, too, cha~gewith age. Osteoporosis is a degenerative bone disease not limited to, but quite frequently found m, the older adult. It is four times more prevalent in older women than in older men. The reasons for bone degeneration are not clear: as the bones age, their substance does not change but the total amount of bone tissue decreases, and the bones become more porous. 55 As a result, an older person's bones are weaker and more susceptible to fracture. 1-49 d I Sleep Disturbance There are a number of reasons why some older persons are wakeful and wander at night. Con\u00ad trary to popular belief, the elderly sleep better and feel more secure when they hear the usual noises of daily living. It has been established that older people sleep less deeply and have more frequent awakenings. Sounds (such as a radio turned down low), a night light, smells, and temperature ch;mges in the sleeping quarters are reassuring and may often lull an olde:rperson back to sleep. Isolation Problems I~I In the majority of older persons who have exhibited psychological problems, it is possible to find isolation of several kinds: 1. Emotional isolation. The person rejects friends, withdraws from social activities, and withdraws into apathy; 2. Social isolation. Friends age and die; the person is left widowed; children become involved with their own families; and retirement separates the person from occupational interactions; 3. Physiological isolation. Age brings changes in the sensory perceptions, producing difficulties with seeing and hearingj,mobility is reduced, restricting exposure to persons outside the home. These isolation problems tend to alter the older individual's ability to maintain a healthy men\u00ad tal status. However, the effects of isolation brought about by a lack of sensory stimulation are rever\u00ad sible. Alleviation of the underlying causes for the isolation, insofar as is possible, has dramatically affected disturbed older persons and can forestall future disorders in presently healthy older per\u00ad sons.56 Minimizing Hazardous Situations There is little that can be done to halt or reverse the organic, muscular, mobility and balance changes that occur in the elderly as part of tlie aging process. However, from a crime prevention point of view, there are several steps which law enforcement officers can take to help make an older person's environment more suitable to his changing needs. The suggestions listed below can become part of a public education campaign aimed at older persons and their families. Officers can also make suggestions for environml!ntal changes on an individual basis to older persons when they are responding to calls for service. The most common problem areas and suggestions for improvement include:57 Safe Home Design 1. Older persons can use furniture to assist them in moving safely around their homes. Officers should recommend that they arrange furniture in a safe home design to allow smooth traffic flow in all rooms; this will eliminate the hazard of falls and allow a quick exit in case of fire or other emergencies.

CONCLUSION IJ aging process, significant physiological h ., . tions tend to reduce the quantity and aft ang~s Occur. M?dlflcatl~ns in the sensory percep- qu I y 0 sensory mformatIOn received. Although I-51 .\\ \\ I :( physiological changes begin at different ages and proceed at different rates, most older persons suc\u00ad cessfullyadjust to the effects of the aging process. These changes, however, can have significant im- pact on the effectiveness of services provided by the law~enforcement officer. D., The officer will be able to communicate more skillfully with older persons who have vision pro\u00ad blems ot nearing impairments by modifying his speaking methods, adjusting his positioning, and providing environmental conditions which facilitate mutual understanding. Physiological changes in the muscular, organ, and skeletal systems can affect anJ)lder person's mobility and balance, risk of injury, and susceptibility to criminal victimization. Law'enff>rcement officers should recommend appropriate precautions which enable the older person to avoid.poten- tially hazardous situations. Although the\u00b7 aging population is comprised of a diverse group of individuals with un.lque at\u00ad tributes, the officer can adapt the technique of effective service delivery in order to meet the older persons' needs. SUMMARY 1. Society's stereotypes and myths about aging reflect many attitudes held by law enforcement of\u00ad ficers about older persons,' these erroneous attitudes negatively affect an officer's ability to com\u00ad municate effectively with older victims ,and witnesses. There may be certain changes in the sensory perceptions of an older crime victim or witness which affect his ability to describe what was seen, what was heard, or even to deal with the fast pace of an interview situation. However, certain facts about an aging individual can be manipulated by the law enforcement officer to maximize the older person's ability to com\u00ad municate. Various vision and hearing changes related to aging may require different communica\u00ad tion techniques and skills on the part of the officer. By rec:ognizing that older persons may have vision and hearing problems, and by taking steps to compensate for these problems, law enforce\u00ad ment practitioners will enhance their ability to meet the service needs and victimization concerns of the elderly. 2. Aging, physiologically and psychologically, is an individual mattf!J;.; . Many sensory functions hold up reasonably \\well with aging. ~~\\~;~ js not synonymous with ill\u00ad ness and some of the common sensory perception changes occurring in old age may become more treatable in the near future. Different organ systems in the same individual may age with dif\u00ad ferent times of onset and at different rates; the onset and rate varies from .one individual to another. The majority of older persons will successfully adjust to changes in their sensory percep- tions and other effects of the aging process.

' I-54 o \",'. 0 o 1 AGING I', The \"psychology of aging\" is a diverse field of study. However, one fact is generally agreed upon-that variation in all attributes increases. From maturity onward, people become less and less alike. The elderly represent the most heterogenequs group in our population. THE MYTH OF SENILITY \"Senility\" pr~bably is the most misunderstood word in the vocabulary of aging. Most people slow down phYSIcally as they age, and this sometimes is true of their mental processes as well. However, senility is not a normal or natural orinevitable part of aging. Careful research has failed to document visible failings in mental abilities as we grow older. The decreases that have been noted may occur because ofJess efficient vision, hearing, and coordination rather. than from any specific brain changes. If the'brain is not used, it becomes less efficient and dullness and confusion may result. Although senility or dementia is one bf the most feared aspects of old ag~, it is actually one of the least common. Studies indicate that the rate of moderate to severe cases in the elderly is estimated at about 2.3 percent. 1 Senile dementia, organic brain syndrome (OBS), or disorientation is a change in mental abilities and personality because of generalized brain damage. Some of the.most common physical factors associated 'Yith the onset of organic brain syndrome are:2 1. Head injury (for example, concussion or contusion) 2. Infection \" 3. Metabolic disorder (for example,' hypoglyc~mia) 4. Toxic chemicals (such as lead or alcohol) 5. Drug reactions 6. Vascular (heart diseases) 7 .. Brain cel1loss (senile dementia) . 8. Other (fdr example, multiple sclerosis) (Short-term delirium is often found in older persons approaching or recovering from a coma those who have a high fever, and those who are intoxicated. Delirium symptoms include confusion disorientation; and incoherence. Perceptual problems occur: for example, people suffering fro~ this condition will improperly identify others, incorrectly interpret stimuli, The most common characterisitics of organic syndrome are: 1 .. 3. Perception: Intellect and Thought: Disorientation about time, place, or person; Mild to severe memory lOSS, unable to recall recent events; Impairment of judgment, occasional auditory and visual hallucinations; Weak intellectual ability, slowed stream of thought; inability to learn new information; , , 5. ~;-~~~ '\\ <:~-- These characteristics may range in \u00b7severity' from barely perceptible changes to proftdrtd difficulty in functioning. Once brain damage has occurred, the person will suffer stresses which may ~ring about pe~s?n\u00ad ality changes. These changes vary, ranging from suspicion, passive, depel}.dence, egocentnclty, rigidity, and irritability to complete neurotic or p~ychotic rea~tions. The behavior. patte~ns originating during periods of brain damage may persist. If OBS IS acute (temp~ra~y), It ma~,.')e reversible. However, if OBS is chronic, it is permanent. Because symptoms are so SimIlar, reversIble and irreversible OBS are often confused. Reversible Organic Brain Syndrome Reversible organic brainsyidromes result from a temporary malfunctioning. of the br~in. ,ce.lls. Alcoholism, anemia, malnutrition, congestive heart failure, diabetes, drug,reach.ons, head mJ~t~s, and infectious can cause the disorder. Treatment usually involves dealing With the underlymg physical disorder. Irreversible Organic Brain Syndrome () In irreversible OBS, the brain damage is permanent. Brain function will progressively decline., The three most common forms of irreversible OBS are senile dementia, strokes, and cerebral arteriosclerosis. Irreversible OBS generally does not occur until after 65 or 70 '~1eat's of age. The causeis not known and the average survival rate is five years. ) . // --' In more and more cases, physicians are diagnosing pseudo dementia, a severe but reversible form of depression that can appear identical to senile dementia. .-Law enforcement officers might find the following suggestions helpful when dealing with con\u00ad fused older persons: 1 . Ensure that the older person is receiving information, i.e., can see and hear you. 2. Establish a familiar enviromrient (a change in environment or strange surroundings can create confusion for some older persons even though they may be able to manage well at home). 3. Communicate slowly and, if possible, break down the information into independent steps (to overcome the confused elderly person's incapacity for short-term memory). 4. Moderate anxieties, fears, and agitations, as necessapr. Reinforce reality, and do not react to' delusion responses. ? u 5. Maintain a tolerant, calm, unflustered manner. There is no direct or simple cause and effect relationship betweel!l brain damage and the presence of impaired mental functioning. At an autopsy, for example, it Js ll10t unusual to find rather exten\u00ad sive changes in the brain although there was little clinical evic(ence of mental impairment before death.4 Mental health is not simply related to the physical characteristics of the human brain but instead is greatly influenced by the way a person deals with his life and the way others treat him. As the scientific community's understanding of the functioninig and changes of the brain in\u00ad creases, the medical profession may then be able to treat older perso,ns who have irreversible organic brain syndrome. Diet, Drugs, And Alcohol Confused older persons generally havefJeen referred to as se,nile; This label has acted to perpetuate a serious myth-that certain behaviors are a consequence; of senility. However, law en~ forcement professionals who encounter older persons with,senility-mimicking behavior have been rejecting the use of the term \"senility,\" ~ince they are becoming more ',aware that there may be other causes for the behavioral patterns. For example, the underlying re~lsons for behaviors generally associated with brain damage in older persons include: health problems, \"normal\" physical changes, dietary deficiencies, food and drug interactions, and drug abltls,e. The law enforcement oj\u00ad ficer has a responsibility to carefully assess the reason for an older individual's behavior-or serious consequenr;es may result. 'I) ,'. Dietary deficiencies can bring about confusion, fatigue, irritability', and insomnia in the elderly. Because of loneliness, lack of mobility, or poverty, an older person Imay fail to maintain proper dietary habits. Malnutrition is common among the elderly.' Older persons are very susceptible to food and drug interactions. li\u00bberhaps the most hazardous interaction is between drugs often' prescribed for depression and high. blood pressure, and such foods as aged cheese, Chianti wine, chocolate, coffee, and cola beverages. s Some drugs can affect ,the way the body uses food. The older person, who generally takes certain drugs over long periods of time, will find that the drug has depleted the body's supply of various nutrients. For example, diuretics, often used to trea~ congestive heart failure, can lead to severe potassium depletion, making the heart more sensitiv,to the effects of the ~mg.6 , ---:--- Nearly 70 percent of t~e elderly have visited a doctor in the past six months. As many as 47 per\u00ad cent of the elderly may misuse medications at anyone time.7 The nature and extent of drug-related problems experienced by the elderly is being examined by the medical profession. However, law enforcement officials must also recognize that this problem exists, since it can affect the behavior of older persons. An officer working with an older victim or citizen in need of assistance may regard his behavior as senile when, in fact, the older person is misusing or abusing drugs. Unfortunately, this problem is not generally recognized until it reaches emergency proportions. Law enforcement officers must be informed and prepared to recognize and deal with these situations since the circumstances associated with drug abuse will affect the officer's ability to understand and effectively provide services to older persons. . There are three primary areas of drug abuse among the elderly: 1. Over-the-counter medications and home remedies 2. PrescriptJon drugs 3. Alcohol land illicit drugs Over-the-counter medications and prescription drugs represent approximately 50 percent of the elderly's total health care budget. he elderly are the largest consumers oj legal drugs. Over-the\u00ad counter medications are mainly analgesics (aspirin), antacids, and laxatives. These last two drugs interfere with the body's ability to absorb nutrients. It is not uncommon for an older person to be prescribed eight or 10 medications ona maintenance basis. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, the federal government's primary agency for issues involving the misuse and abuse of drugs, reports that, while almost two-thirds of the entire patient population are female, the greatest users of sedative-hypnotic drugs are males over age 65.8 Two major concerns with prescription drugs are reactions to standard dosage levels and drug-drug interactions. All too frequently, standard dosage levels are prescribed which are safe for younger age groups but are excessive for older persons. Changes in the body's handling of drugs with age tends to in\u00ad crease the elderly person's susceptibility to the overdosage of many medications-especially sedatives, diuretics, and anti-coagulants. In addition, the older person's increased sensitivity to drug effects makes him more likely to suffer side effects. Drug-drug interactions are a significant problem for the elderly since multiple and unmonitored use of medications is commonplace. Different physicians may not have checked on previously prescribed medications pefore prescribing. Hence, the rate of adverse drug-drug interactions in\u00ad creases as the number of drugs prescribed increases. The drugs most frequently prescribed for' the I-58 ,~ '# . y ., \\ . ' I elderly are (sleeping pills), pain ffelievers, and sedatives (tranquilizers). Drug-drug inter\u00ad actions will intensify, negate, or alter the effect of one or both drugs. Alcohol is believed by some to be the most abused drug among the elderly. Misuse can involve drug-drug interactions or excessive use of alcohol, leading to addiction. Alcohol does not mix well with a wide variety of medications often used by older persons. Antibiotics, anticoagulants, an\u00ad tihistimines, antidepressants, and antidiabetic drugs, including insulin, will interact with alcohol to produce undesirable side effects. Alcohol may increase the risk ofl';:~':\\i)oglycemia, or result in ex- cessive sedation and loss of balance. 9 . ' . It is estimated that two to 10 percent of the elderly are alcoholic. Some older alcoholics began drinking heavily late in life, While others have been abusing alcohol for most of their adult life. Late life alcoholics often develop their drinking problem for different reasons than younger alcoholics. Environmental circumstances rather than personality factors contribute to alcoholism among the elderly. Bereavement, with its loneliness and depression~ and retirement-with its boredom, loss of status, and lower income-are two major situations influencing older persons who become problem\u00ad drinkers. However, this type of alcoholic is often much more responsive to treatment then younger alcoholics. The law enforcement officer should be cautious in making an assumption of alcohol intoxication on the basis of staggering gait, slurred speech, and an odor of alcohol on the breath. In such cases, an older person may actually have diabetic acidosis, hypoglycemia, uremia, impending or completed strok~, or other cerebral impairment. Alcohol abuse in the elderly may bring about drug interactions .or may develop into addiction. By attempting to determine the causes of behavioral problems in an older person, the officer can decide the proper action to take. Although research efforts are still being conducted to identify the extent of substance abuse among the older population, training efforts have begun for physicians, pharmacists, health care providers, and law enforcement officers. Many law enforcement agencies are endorsing community programming efforts, such as \"Vial of Life\" and' 'Medic Alert\" bracelets, so that officers On street patrol will be able to assure that older victims obtain the proper medical attention. MENTAL DISORDERS Although many law enforcement officers do not view dealing with persons who have mental disorders as one of their obligations, many people consider this to be a police role. The community expects its law enforcement agency to deal with mentally disordered persons because of the potential for violence and their frequent disturbance of public order. In such cases, the officer is expected to resolve problems rather quickly and usually without much information about the individual's past history . .But, in order to perform satisfactorily, the officer needs to be able to recognize thesymp\u00ad toms of mental disorders in the elderly, as well as techniques to deal with these problems. .

Contrary to popular belief, the overwhelming majority oj older persons live normal, emotionaily stable lives. 11, I-59 ... ,; I , I n 11 \\l \\l 'I H II 11 \\\\ i \" )l The psychological mental disorders of old age may persist from youth and adulthood or they may first appear in old age. These two kinds of psychological ment~l disorde~~ are called carry-~ver and age-specific. With carry-over mental disorders, the psychologIcal conditlOns.a~e brought .mto old age and are usually modified to some extent by the aging process. In age-specIfic mental dIsorders, psychological conditions appear for the first time in old age. Generally speaking, m~ntal disorders may be classed as neurotic reactions or psychoses.lo Neurotic Reactions The neurotic person generally recognizes that his feelings and, reactions a~e inappropriate. Neurosis is regarded by most modern authorities as a rGsponse to anxIety, dev~lopmg from actual or perceived stress. Symptoms of neuroses appear to be nearly univers~l; m?st people ~t some. ti~e. are likely to develop some form of neurosis. Since the quantity and mtensity of stress m late hfe IS mcreased, the older person's vulnerability to neurosis becomes greater: Neurotic reactions in the elderly encompass a variety of emotions and behaviors, including grief, stress, anxiety, depression dissociative reactions, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and hypochon- dria. Grief. The normal emotional reaction to an actual loss is grief, which involves a cl~ar, co~scious recognition of the loss, After feeling the initial shock of the loss, there may be recumng penods of crying and waves of sadness. For example, grief fr0!ll the dea~h of a loved .one may be .felt from three to 12 months before the impact of the loss begms to subsIde and energIes,may. be dIrected to new interests and people. Grief resolution requires acceptance of ~he new, sItuation. However, resolution may be difficult or impossible when the older person has ~Ixed ,feelIngs ~bout the loss., In the case of the death of a spouse, the partner may have a\u00b7sense of rehef mmgled w~th the desolation of losing a companion. This may not be recognized,and, the survivor m~y feel gmlty ~t the lack of appropriate emotion. 1 1 When grief is prolonged and It gams momentum, It may merge mto a depres- sion. Stress. The older person's responses to emotional or situational stress is influenc~d by prior life experiences. Stress reactions are normally of short duration. As a person ages, he wlll have to.co~e with accumulating stresses. At the same time, the physical and mental energy nee~~d for copmg IS diminishing. As the body ages, sensory perceptions, muscular strength, a~d mobIhty and balance change. Inteliectual abilities, speed of response, and memory also are chan~m~. T~us, the older per\u00ad son must find adaptive techniques to cope adequately with the stresses wlthm ,hIS bo~y a~ well as those within his environment. He must preserve self-esteem, avert f~rther d,ISorgamzati~n, and maintain order and equilibrium in his life. A changing marital role, famIly relatlOns, and retue?Ient can profoundly affect the older person's self-concept, his responsibilit.ies, and his preoccupatlOns. At the same time, the older person must continue to meet his basic surVIval needs-a dec,ent. p~ace t,o live, good diet, adequate income, clothing, friendship, and a sens~ of useful~ess. The ~~d1Vldu~1 s ability to fulfill these basic needs independently becomes more taxmg as physIcal capaCItIes declme and, in some cases, income diminishes. 1-60 ~hh din.\" Ok, hiS :1 ~'i\"'It\".jl\\\"'ii~iR~&Jii_1 _~I\\~:::\u00b7,\u00b7J ~ , . \\ Other changes contribute to the stress load for older persons. The loss of a spouse and old friends as well as the approach of one's own death add stress. The increases in violence and crime occurring over the past few years have been a source of much stress to many older persons, particularly those who live in changing city environments,12 But one of the most stressful factors in an older person's life is becoming dependent and losing control over his own life. The losses and stresses of old age are real and inescapable. Even the anticipation of losses causes internal stresses for the older person. It matters little whether the loss is real or imagined. In fact, imagined losses contribute to even greater internal stresses. Imagined losses can impair the older per\u00ad son~s capacity to evaluate reality and to adjust psychologically. Anticipation of an impending loss is frequently more troublesome than actuality. Anxiety. Anxiety is a complicated psychophysiological response. Physiological symptoms which accompany anxiety include: muscular tenseness, restlessness, rapid heart rate, and excessive sweating. These are body signs of preparation for fight or flight. The psychophysiological response to anxiety changes with age. Anxiety in old age may be related not to a specific event but to the more general aspects of growing old. Older adults experience many situations which produce anxiety; conversely, they do not experience very many situations which reduce anxiety.I3 Anxiety reactions may be acute or chronic. In an acute anxiety attack, the older person may show panic and be temporarily incapacitated. Owing to its dramatic nature and the briefly severe disabili\u00ad ty, an anxiety reaction is frequently mistaken for a serious organic disorder, such as a heart attack. In chronic or prolonged anxiety states, the older person will,experience changes in appetite and in\u00ad somnia. He will feel irritable and experience fear, dread, panic, nervousness, apprehension, 'or uneasiness. But he will not be able to explain why. Depression. Depression is the most common symptom olf neurosis in the elderly. The signs of depression in younger age groups-anger, self-deprecatory thoughts, and crying spells-are not as common in older groups. More often, the depressed older pe~,'son will seem to be inattentive and suf\u00ad fering from memory impairments; he will have a loss of enerSlY and initiative. All too often, an older person who is essentially depressed will be diagnosed for organic brain syndrome, institutionalized, and treated inappropriately. Dissociative Reactions. In the process of dissociation, :a portion of the personality seems to operate more or less independently. A common manifestation of this disorder is sleepwalking, which involves movements that occur outside of ordinary cI)n.sciousness. An older person also may experience a loss of memory and leave his usmll environment. He may wander about, perhaps in a strange city or in other unfamiliar surroundings, sometimcis in an aimless or confused fashion for days, weeks, or longer.' . Obsessive-Compulsive Behaviors. Examples of obsessiv()-compulsive behaviors are easily obser\u00ad vable-ear pulling, eyebrow raising, or finicky cleanliness, Often included with these reactions are socially undesirable behaviors, including exhibitionism (clxtreme attention seeking), kleptomania (compulsive stealing, for other reasons than the intrinsic v~lue of what was taken), pyromania (com\u00ad pulsive fire-setting), and voyeurism (peeping-tom behavior)l. Although rare, the law enforcement of- ficer may have to deal with the older kleptomaniac. I 1-61 , , I( .' Hypochondria hypochondriac displays an obsessive type of preoc\u00ad cupation with bodily functions. This symptom is common in older women and can be quite difficult to change. ' There are wide differences in neurotic reactions among older individuals; the same environmental stresses that bring on acute anxiety in one person may leave another relatively undisturbed and disable still another. Two concepts about neurotic emotions and behaviors have useful application' for law enforcement officers who deal with the elderly: 1. A person's previous life experiences will take emotional precedence over subsequent events. For example, the police officer who stops an older driver for speeding may approach the vehicle and notice that the driver is very afraid, is perspiring, and is shaking. There are many explanations for this type of behavior. If the older person is an immigrant fmm a nation which has a totalitarian system of government, he may genuinely fear ALL police-based upon previous negative life ex\u00ad periences. Similarly, an older person whose home has been burglarized for the second time in a month may be sarcastic toward the patrol officer who responds to the call simply because the of\u00ad ficers who responded to the burglary a month earlier were surly and did not seem to care about help\u00ad ing the victim-thus, the victim, who did not receive courteous assistance from the police after the first burglary, may expect the same negative police response after the second burglary. 2. A number of advantages are derived from neurotic emotions and behaviors. Often, older persons with inadequate personal support from their relatives, friends, and neighbors will rely on neurotic activities to get the sympathy, help, and understanding they need. Thus, they may frequently call the police to complain (attention-getting needs satisfied), to report a \"prowler\" or \"burglar\" (which assures them of a police visit and some \"company\"), or to voice suspicions about \"illegal\" activities in their neighborhood (this enables them to become a \"celebrity\" by brag\u00ad ging to other older people that they are \"helping the police solve a big crime\"). Psychoses Psychoses commonly designate severe or major psychiatric disorder~ in which the people who are labeled psychotic do not seem to realize that there is anything wrong with them. Many classifications for psychoses have beef). proposed. One that has been generally recognized distinguishes between organic psychoses (such as organic brain syndrome) and those in which an organic basis has not yet been generally established or agreed upon. Each type of psychotic disturbance varies considerably in .1efinition, causes, symptoms, and treat\u00ad ment, and should be examined separately. The psychoses described below are of particular '.significance in some older persons. Schizophrenia. Late life schizophrenia (Greek: \"split mind\") encompasses a numoier of similar patterns of reactions to the stresses of life. Generally, there are disturbances of feeling and thinking and a withdrawal from the outside world. In an attempt to escape from tension and anxiety, the 1-62 ~=--= ___________________________ ~ __ ~ I .-(I \".::'1 \" , / older schizophrenic will abandon realistic interpersonal relationships and, in their place, construct delusions and hallucinations. These people are typically apathetic, seclusive, rejective of social con\u00ad tact, dull, and unresponsive. Late life schizophrenia is more frequent among the unmarried, immigrants, those with low economic status, and those ~ho live in large cities. Paranoia. Many psychiatrists consider paranoia to be a variety of schizophrenia. Mild paranoid reactions are not entirely outside the range of normal experience, however. Most people have been, at one time or another, unjustly suspicious of neighbors and friends, and have interpreted neutral acts as hostile and threatening. Paranoid reactions are more frequent in old age, particularly in older persons who are socially isolated and have vision problems or hearing losses (especially deafness). In many cases when sen\u00ad sory loss is corrected with eyeglasses or a hearing aid, the paranoia will disappear. Generally, unmarried men in their forties and fifties who tend to have difficulties in relating io people are diagnosed as paranoid. This perSOll feels persecuted or imagines plots and conspiracies organized against him or against parts of society with which he identifies. At times the person sees himself as a hero whose mission it is to save society. Sometimes the paranoid person may attempt to kill the alleged persecutors, but more often he becomes the plantiff in almost endless legal suits. Paranoid delusions will range from hostile (persecutions and injustice) to grandiose (grandeur and supernatural powers). Some older persons react to these delusions by constantly moving. For exam\u00ad ple, over a period of eight years, one 66-year-old man had moved in and out of 14 boarding homes. Paranoid older persons often call for and respond well to police officers. Paraphrenia. The term \"paraphrenia\" dates back to the early nineteenth century and has been used by authorities in different ways. Sigmund Freud suggested the term \"paraphrenia\" to describe a middle-aged patient whom he analyzed as suffering from paranoia as well as schizophrenia. Some experts deny its existence as a separate clinical entity and claim that it is a variety of schizophrenia. However, paraphrenia is often used by psychiatrists trained in clinical geropsychiatry (the psychiatry of aging) and needs to be made part of the vocabulary for law enforcement practitioners who deal with the elderly. Late life paraphrenia is a mental state characterized by a thought disorder with paranoid delu\u00ad sions, with or without hallucinations; yet the intellect, personality, and memory remain healthy. Older persons with paraphrenia have not had previous personality disorders.14 Paraphrenia commonly occurs after age 60. The paraphrenic is typically a single or widowed female; she has few close relatives and has been living alone for many years. Good health is com\u00ad mon, except for problems with vision and hearing. The paraphrenic often has persecutory delu\u00ad sions-she is being drugged, or her body is being assailed by rays, machines, or electricity. She \"hears\" threatening voices, obscenities, and loud noises. Such delusions and hallucinations may have erotic overtones. 1-63 -\"\"\"\"F'>I!!~\"'~~_i4I.iiiZ).!liiiAi i.1 \"~_'ilIi!Il;ilili_\"ilSllil2i&!i.'ii!lI;~a it. iIt~~q proximity to the paraphrenic of the external enemy, intr:uder, or foreign body indicates the severity of the disorder. In its early phase, the enemy is seen outside the home-hoodlums on the street or in front of the house who are acting obnoxiously or speaking vulgar language. During the next phase, the intruder comes into the garden or onto the porch. The third phase is the penetration of the home, e.g., in the plumbing, electrical wiring, or even the food in the refrigerator. The fourth and final phase brings the enemy into the person's person~(l space. The paraphrenic's behavior and thoughts can subside for intermittent peliods. For example, a 74-year-old widow phoned various community agencies complaining that the neighborhood boys kept her awake at night and damaged her property. She feared the boys would burn her house if she made any complaints (projection of her own sense of feeling \"burned up\" about being victimized). AJew weeks later, the delusions changed: she accused the pharmacy of giving her pills with the wrong color. Again, a few weeks later, she became acutely apprehensive during the night and called the police for help. After this, she complained that it had taken the police many hours to arrive, and they had searched her house for illegal liquor . It is significant that once the woman was placed in a boarding home, the paranoid symptoms subsided. IS The paraphrenic may survive for a long period of time and generally does not recover. Emotional Psychoses. Emotional psychoses include manic-depressive psychoses and psychotic depression. In the case of manic-depressive psychosis, the individual has no insight into the abnor\u00ad mal nature of his mood-he experiences periods of depression followed by manic attacks. These moods are recurring, sometimes cyclical, attacks. During depression the person neglects his ap\u00ad pearance and slows down to the point where he seems unable to move or to talk. Insomnia, de\u00ad creased appetite, and weight loss are common symptoms. Depressive attacks have a longer duration than the manic ones, especially as the disorder progresses. The manic individual typically shows a good humor; however, he may change to sarcasm and hostility when in a conflict situation. Accom\u00ad panying motor activity can be excessive and exhausting. Older persons rarely exhibit intense, endur- ing manic attacks. Feelings only of depression are more likely to be considered as a separate disorder-psychotic depression. Some authorities will consider it a partial form of manic-depressive psychosis. Psychotic depression occurs more frequently in later life. Experts compare the symptoms to normal grief. The poor judgment of manics and the possibility of suicide and violence among depressives are traits which often demand law enforcement attention. The older psychotic depressive often has con\u00ad vinced himself that his depression and suffering are intolerable. This individual is dangerous to himself. The officer may consider the underlying reasons why the older driver doesn't brake quickly enough at the stop sign or the older pedestrian isn't finished crossing the street before the traffic light changes to green. In other instances, older persons with emotional psychoses are a danger to others. An older alcoholic may provoke fights or attack a police officer. The older person may verbally/physically abuse his spouse. Some people who have this disorder consider their spouse as part of theplselves and may kill the spouse before attempting suicide. In older persons whose religion or cultural values 1-64 {I .I pr~hi~it suicide, there are many ways and means to have someone else '\\doctor officer etc) take theIr bves. ' ,. . It is advisable to hospitalize older persons with emotional psychoses, particularly since they can be a danger to themselves as well as others. SUICIDE AFTER SIXTY Older Americans are d~a~IY serious about killing themselves. Each year the proportion of suicides among older persons outw~Ighs that of any other age group. People aged 60 or older comprise about 15. ~ercent of t~e populatIon but account for 25 to 30 percent of the total number of reported su~c~des. (See FIgure Oliepelow.)16 Among adolescents, there are 50 attempts for every actual su~c~d~. Among the elderl~'i!~owev~r, the ratio is two to one. Many experts agree that the number of SUICIdes by olde~ persons IS,:I~ realIty, much higher than the reported figure. False certifications of an older person s actual SUICIde because the death appears to be accidental or natural may b a great as the number of reported suicides. e s 50 45 z o ~ 40 ::l :s 25 Q. o g 30 o\u00b7 o ,.. ffi 25 Q. ct) W 20 ~ a: ~ 15 U 5 en 10 5 FIGURE ONE Suicide Rates in the United States in Relation to Age and Race KEY: _ white males .

For men suicide rates rise sharply and consistently with age. Rates of sUlcIde are hIgher for wh~t~s than for 'non-whites. The highest incidence of suicides is among white males over the age of 75; It IS more than seven times that of young adults in their early twenties. There is still no definitive explanation of why suicide is more prevalent ~mop~ men than wom~n.

The negative ~ffects are .not as. mte~se among those who enter retirement with hobbies, organizational memberships, and fnendshIp/km networks to occupy their time and attention. ., f h d The variation in male/female suicide rates can be partially explamed m terms 0 t e m~ans an motivations leading to suicide. Men are more likely to use violent means (e.~., guns, kmves, and ropes) to take their lives while women show a strong preference for more pass~ve approaches (e.g., d as and poisons) In addition to the typical methods of self-destructIon, the elderly have o~~;:';ea~s that are pec~liar to their age group. These include: self-iIilP~sed. starvation, refu~i~~ to follow a physician's orders, not taking medications as pre~cribed, engagmg m hazardous actlVltIes, delaying treatments or operations, and voluntarily secludmg themselves. The association of suicide with the inability to cope with a vital loss has been well documented. There c~uld be losses associated with: (1) Severe physical illness, extraordinary pain, chronic conditions, or terminal illness; . (2) Mental illness; (3) Threat of extreme dependency (su.ch as loss ~f a .dri~er's !ice?se: inability to walk, having to live with relatives against one's WIll) and/or mstItutIonalIzatIon,,- (4) Death of a spouse or relative (a particularly severe hardship during the first year of bereave\u00ad ment); (5) Retirement (loss of job or income); (6) Alcoholism and drug abuse (most commonly used were sleeping pills; tranquilizers, and pain relievers); (7) Loss of a best friend or cherished neighborhood;_ (/\\\\ (8) Any cumulative effect of multiple misfortuner}:;) ) , The crucial factor is not the effect of anyone loss ip:pJhicular, but rather the unexpectedness .and suddenness of its onset and the sufferer'S personal reacfion to it (especially its effect when com~med It II I( 1-66 . f I , .-, . \" \"\\ \\1 with existing problems). Thus, a series of losses striking in rapid succession is often devastating. A suicidal reaction will 'depend upon how well developed the older person's coping abilities are and how strong the \"will to live\" is. Although the suicide rate has declined over the last two decacies, there still has been a continuous increase in the number of elderly suicides. The problem will be difficult to address since suicide is such a complex behavior that it is exceptionally difficult to prevent or effectively control. Suicide by older people can be a more' difficult problem in another sense-even people who are adamantly op\u00ad posed to suicide per se are often able to condone the older person who commits suicide to relieve pain, suffering, and extreme anguish. , The majority of people who kill themselves, regardless of age, appear to consult a phYF).>ian shortly before their lethal acts. It seems reasonable to conclude that \"suicidal peopl~ seek or.;.physi\u00ad cians as potential rescuers.\" Although much of the responsibility for the reduction of suicides by older people rests with physicians, there is also a great need for more public education about how to recognize and respond to clues the older person presents. Many of the suicidal elderly will present clues-either verbal or behavioral-to their impending suicides. The lack of knowledge, fear, and a basic inability of their families, friends, neighbors, and physicians to act in a prudent manner seem to play a critical role in many of the suicides of the elderly. It may become necessary for the police officer to refer older persons to suicide centers. Some of the clues to suicide include: A suicide attempt or threat A statement of one's desire to die A gun purchase While not necessarily clues to suicide, under certain circumstances the following behaviors could warrante...areful attention; ,if \\\\ Tears 'for no appr,tr~fnt '( Funeral plans n1f:;;~:-sliortly arti3r t.~~ death of a loved one Arrangements t~~ donate one's body to science Giving away val\\~ed possessions Breaking a long-~tanding behavior Putting one's business affairs in order Thousands of lives could be saved each year if people would recognize and respond to such behaviors quickly,l7 \" LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE Law enforcement officers cannot be expected to be experts on the psychological problems of aging. Nevertheless, in the course of their duties, they will be called upon to respond to situations in\u00ad volving older persons as complainants, as victims, or simply as persons in need of help. In many in- , I p \" ... ~/~tances, the police are the first to respond; in some instances, they 'are the only plfblic agency responding to the problem. If the older person is manifesting symptoms of brain damage or of severe emotional distress, the law enforcement officer will be expected\" to recognize these symptoms and to deal with the older person appropriately. Each law enforcement officer should know well 'those portiof\"'s of the state's statntfs that,d~fihe the authority and responsibilities of the law enforcement officer with regard to per~ons suffering from mental disordei~~\u00b7~.ldividual jurisdictions may also have specific regulations on mental cases, or will have either established policy or informal procedures fOr the voluntary or involuntary admis\u00ad sion of persons to psychiatric facilities. The individual officer needs to be familiar with these regula\u00ad tions and procedures. An example of the type of general order p~~cribed is giverr)below: \" Emergency Admission Policy and Procedure If a police officer of the rank of sergeatiVor above has determined. there is probable cause to belie\\\u00b7i~ an (older) individual is mentally disoriented and is in imminent danger of causing grave and immediate personal injury to himself or others, he shall:18 1 . Complete a petition for emergency admission. 2. Take the individual named or described in the petition into custody. 3. Take the person to an \"emergency facility\" to be examined by a physician within 6 hours. 4. Notify the court within 24 hours. 5. If iLia determined that probable cause exists, the reviewing judge will have the person detained for an additional period not to exceed 96 hours. 6. Any fUrther action (or detention) will require the signature of two physicians. Some responsible person within the law enforct;:ment agency-if not the individual officer-must be aware of and maintain a working liaison with those agencies within the community that are equipped and trained to deal with older persons who are suffering from brain damage or mental disorders. LEARNING The ability to learn is a( complex process. Three particularly important aspects of the learning process are inte1,ligence, tndnory, and problem-solving. On the following pages, thefe aspects will be discussed briefly, especially as they relate to older persons. Almost any older person can learn almost anything he \\\\.\u00b7~nts to,. giv~n time and a~sis~~nc~. Although there are substantial individual differences in learnihg ability ,httle of the varIabIlIty IS relatelt to age. Adult learning reflects the innate ability, practical values and accumulated experience that the individual combines in performance. . :::;; f / , . At present, there is no .instrument to estimate adult learning ability; However, there are certain ~ea~h.mg procedures and educational practices that\u00b7 optimize the performance of the older mdlVldual. (, Some factors which can affect the oider adult's learning ability include: Personal Character.~tics. Physiological condition and health can affect learning in various ways. Sensory changes in vision an~ ~e~ring can restrict se?sory input. Stress can impair memo~. Steps sh?uld be !aken to mtmmize the extent to physiological condition and health mtcrfere WI!~ le~rnmg: Examples incl~de the provision of sufficient lighting glar.e, sound amplIfIcation WIth go0c!acoustics, and conditioIis that minimi2;e fatigue and anxIety. i tI '\\ 'personal outlook and personality chan!.cteristics, such as open-mindedness o~ defensiveness c~n affect the way i? which an adult deals with spG:;lfic types of learning situations. Some adult~ With open and flexIble personality characteristics and learning stYles achieve better with such methods as discussion, while adults with more rigid and structured personality characteristics and learning styles learn more effectively with such methods as the lecture. \" Situ~tional C?haract~ristics. Over-arousal, such as defen~iveness and tectIve.learDl~g, ~hIle .moder~te levels of arousal do not. If an older person believes that he can deal WIth a .sItuatI<~n, It may De a challenge; if not, it may be perceived as a threat. People can deal best WIth a faIlure when they have experienced many sucs~sses. \\ ... i . Support and assistance is especially important for adults with few recent educational exper\u00ad Iences. The law enforcement Officer should realize his responsibility to enhance the climate fo'\" learning when he is attempting to teach something new such as crime prevention to olde;' adults.19 Unsuitable training methods may introduce anxiety and lead to failure which will so shake ~/d.er people's confidence that they are then unable to learn or to do jdbs they would otherWise have been able to tackle wel/.20 . Expectation~. M~st older adults approach learning activities with specific expectations about what .they wIll gam from the expenence. Older adults are more likely to emphasize reasons for learnm~ that are related to content and activity, while younger adults tend to be goal-onented.21 When. t~e mate~jal is not meaningful, there is a marked decline in learning with a~e. For this reason, It IS most Important to establish a rapport and climate that encourages and allows older persons to consider their own expectations and those of others and to help identify objectives select iearning tasks, and understand. procedures. . ' One way in which older adults can clarify their expectations is to h~ve an example or model of what they should.know or to b.e able to do. For example, home security techniques might be ta~ght most effec~Ively by takmg a group of older adults to a typiC'll home in their neIghborhood, the mstructor can teach security principles as he guides the group ona walking tour of the inside and outside of the house. ' 1-69 r) Relevance. The older adult's motivation and cooperation in learning is more likely when the tasks are meaningful and of interest to him. As with younger age groups, individual values vary greatly. However, the older generations will have certain values and expectations. Usually, wht=m an older adult sets out to learn a~out something, he makes use of past experiences and past reactions to increase his ability to learn and use knowledge. Prior learning and personal. experience may not have produced an adequate mind set (or expectation) about the relevance of a learning task. Questions, prompting devices, organizers, and directions can guide the older person's attention and help establish the connectjQT'.between his current knowledge and the new information .. When the information is perceived as I \"'. vant, the older person can apply what he learns in his daily life. If not, the older person may distod the new information to minimize any discrepancies or he may totally withdraw from the learning situation. Intelligence The concept of intelligence, as well as the instruments used to measure it, are usually d~fined in terms of the abilities and skills deemed to be most important during youth and early adlHthood.22 For years, it was generally believed that a person's IQ tended to rise through youth and adolescence, reach a plateau in the thirties, and then, after forty, begi~ a slow decline. But in 1973, the Task Force on Aging of the American Psychological Associatiori found that the facts contradicted this notion.23 Longitudinal studies have shown no change in intellectual functioning with age. Intelligence is measured by testing verbal skilis, memory, spatial perception, and arithmetic abilities. From these measurements, intelligence wa~ found to vary with age in different ways. For example, mental abilities that require speed or which depeno.llpqn immediate memory will show a greater decline with age than those abilities that are untimed or depend on experience. Qn the other hand, tests on general information, general verbal ability, and arithmetic operations will frequently show evidence of increased capacity with age from the twenties to the sixties and beyond.24 Any precipitous decline in intelligence is not indicative of normal aging but instead results from a drop in the health status of the individual. Memory Memory is an important part of the ability to learn. The memory function can be described as a three-step process involving: registration, the input of information into a system; storage, the reten\u00ad tion of that information for subsequent use; and retrieval, the process of obtaining information from stored information. Most psychologists advocate that different processes are involved with short-term memory as opposed to long-term memory. As an example, short-term memory has a limited storage capacity while long-term memory has a much longer, more stable storage capacity which is limited only by the rate at which it can accept information. Research studies at present indi\u00ad cate that older persons can maintain and recall about as much information in short-term memory as younger persons; howlever, when the storage capacity of short-term memory is exceeded age deficits occur. The problem of \"int:erference\" may explain why older persons experience memory losses.2s They may be more susceptible to conditions 'which interefere with memory. Interference with registering data may have occurred prior to learning. An older person may be unwilling or unable to accept and 1-70 \\ / internalize new information which conflicts with his experiences. Interference also can occur during learning. Outside interferences, such as extraneous noise, movements of others in and out of the learning situation, and simultaneous activities which are~ccurring all compete for the elderly per\u00ad son's attention.26 Or th~ information may not be adequa\\\\~ly heard or seen. Interference can occur after learning, as when information that appears to be irrelevant, insignificant, or of little value is not retained. There are many techniques to enhance an older person's memory. These include: 1 . Presentation Pacing. A slower presentation rate will enable older persons to increase their ability to retain information and avoid informatiolloverload. Instructors should consider tak\u00ad ing a short break even during a lecture session wJ:.Jch lasts only an hour. Older persons will also learn better if the training is spaced at intervals'/~>ver a period of several weeks rather than con\u00ad centrated in an intensive course. The ideal pacing for older adults is to allow them t< I set their own pace and take a break periodically. Although adults vary greatly in the speed at IWhich they learn most effectively, older adults tend to reduce the speed of If~arning and give greate\\' attention to accuracy. If older persons are forced to proceed much faster or slower than their preferred pace, their learning effectiveness generally declines. 2. Response Pacing. A longer response time will enhance the older adult's ability to retrieve needed information. There is substantial research evidence that older persons are more suscep\u00ad tible to interference with retrieval of information. If an older person is having difficulty recall\u00ad ing information, it should be noted that he will probably be able to recognize information much more readily than to recall it. 3. Organization. Organization of the information with mediators and mnemonic groupings serves to increase learning and improve memory. Older persons should be given specific in\u00ad structions to increase their use of organizational techniques. For example, it would be helpful to provide a skeleton outline indicating points to be covered. Older adults learn more ef\u00ad fectively if the instructor provides organizers, sets o( categories, and generalized structures to assist them in organizing complex material.27 Prob~em Solving The characteristics of problem-solving tasks that are most associated with a decline iIi learning ability with age (even in middle age) are tasks that are fast paced, unfamiliar, and complex. The pac\u00ad ing can be slowed down, more care can be taken in providing directions, and complex tasks can be broken down. Older adults tend to learn most effectively when problems are complex enough not to be boring but not so complex that they are overwhelming. The critical area of problem-solving for older adults is previdus learning. An older person tends to repeat his errors. Unlearning an incorrect response is particularly difficult for him. Therefore, it is essential to deal with problems immediately and not allow misconceptions to persist. If, for exam\u00ad ple, directions are not simple, the older person sometimes arrives at misconceptions based upon in\u00ad complete information. When that occurs, it is usually diWcult to overcome. When older persons I ,!

To summarize, some ways law enforcement officers can help older adults learn effectively include: 1. Emphasize abilities and experience. 2. Establish a comfortable climate for learning-physiological and psychological. 3. Assess the older person's learning expectations. 4. Minimize interference. 5. Decre~se pacing-allow more presentation response time. \\\\ !!\\ 6. Clarify and provide organization and structure. ,\\1 7. Identify obstacles to problem-solving') Allow older persons to practice and reinforce new information.\" CONCLUSION The psychology of aging is a diverse field of study encompassing changes in br~in functio~s, me?\u00ad tal processes and personality. Researchers have documented that senile dementIa or orgamc br?In syndrome (OBS) is rare in the elderly. As older persons who exhibit behavior patterns resem~lmg 'senility are thoroughly diagnosed and treated, more and more cases are found to be reversIble, treatable and not caused solely by brain damage. ' To satisfactorily deal with the myriad of situations involving law enforcement and older per~ons, officers need to recognize symptoms of brain damage, mental disorders, an~. severe emotIonal distress. Solutions in handling such circumstances can vary, from provIdmg support and reassurance to suIcide intervention. Most importantlYl: law enforcement officers should apply teaching prm:edures and edu~ational practices in their wOI:k with volunt':!~~s, me.m~ry, arid assisting in problem~solvjng, the officer can best help older persons to mamt.am lIves of dIgmty, independence and purppse. ' , , ',',- As gerontologists discover or establish new facts about aging, la~ enforcement profe~sionals ~ill need to update their understanding in order to protect and proVIde older persons wIth effective services. 1-72 c . Senility is not a normal or natural part oj the aging process. /1 1'1 . Law eriforcemcimt officers should not~6nfuse \"senility\" with erratic behavior on the part of older persons. Rather than suffering from any specific changes in the, brain, the older person may be having difficulties expressing himself or moving about in public because of less effi~ cient vision, hearing, and coordination. Whe!'acdealifllfwitln:onfUsed older persons, ,~he law en\u00ad forcement officer should: (1) ensure that the older per\\;on is receiving information; (2) establish a familiar environment; (3) communicate slowly al1d, if possible, break down the in~ formation into independent steps; (4) moderate anxieties, fl~ars, and agitations and reinforce reality, and; (5) maintain a tolerant, calm, unflustered manner. ()o, '. Law enforcement officers need to be able to recognize the symptoms of mental disorders in the . elderly In order to deal with these problems effectively. The community expects its law enforcement officers to deal with mentally disturbed persons ber:ause of the potential for violence and their frequent disturbance of public order. However, contrary to popular belief, the overwhelming majority of older persons do not suffer from mental problems: most older people live normal, emotionally stable lives. But there are mental disorders of old age, either carry-over or age-specific, which th(~ law enforcement officer needs to know how to recognize so that he can effectively assist the older person w,Q.o is, suffering from a mental problem. Someone within the law enforcement agency should be assigned the responsibility for maintaining a working liaison with those agencies within the community that are equipped and trak~td to deal with older persons who are suffering from prain damage or mental disorders. 3. Law enforcement officers who conduct crime prevention programs for older persons or who train older volunteers should familiarize themselves with the process of learning as it applies to older adults. Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence to demonstrate that intellectual functioning decreases with age. Almost any older person can learn almost anything he wants to, given time and assistance. However, there are certain factors whicK can affect the older adult's learning ability; these factors include personal characteristics, e~k'~ctations, and };'elevance of the sub.;. ject matter. To overcome these problems, there are certain teaching procedures and edtwa\u00ad tional practices which can be used to optimize the performance of the older individual-th~se include: presentation pacing, response pacing, and organization of the information with mediators and mnemonic groups to increase learning .and improve 'memory.

M ! LESSON ONE CRIME PROBLEM IN PERSPECTIVE The issue of victimization of the\u00b7 elderly' is complex in nature and requires a careful analysis of in\u00ad formation that has been developed frOID a variety of sources. While victimization studies are valuable tools in developing problem-solving approaches to the issue of crimes against the elderly, there al'e, however, important limitations on their scope of jurisdiction. Thus, studies presented in Lesson One must be qualified by the following factors: 1. The geographical locations surveyed are overwhelmingly urban and suburban in nature. This is due entirely to the availability of field research, such as the National Crime Surveys, which focus upon urban/suburban environments. Despite such an urban orientation, these studies can still serve as indicators of future problems in rural areas. Rural crime is rapidly increasing and is mote and more reflecting typologies once found exclusively in urban settings.l 2. The survey information becomes more dated with age. However, some of the studies cited here have been repeated over a period of time: comparison of c9rr:~nt data with past findings in\u00ad dicates that problems identified in-:::~~JieI' s,urveys have inteDsified in more recent years. While this finding either says something about 6ur crirninal justice system' or indicates that crime reporting systems have improved, it also maintains the credibility of earlier studies. 3. The most important qualifier of all is the need for local crime analyses. Regardless of the time and location of any victimization study, it can only produce findings for that jurisdiction. This issue will be addressed throughout all four lessons, and cannot be overemphasized. Lesson One does not speak for every locality, but identifies trends on a nationwide basis. LAW ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES The responsibility for law enforcement in the United States is divided among over 20~OOO autonomous agencies.2 This disparity of responsibility creates many levels of decision-making, rant\u00ad ing from national program direction to the discretionary decisions made by officers on patrol within a community. At each of these ends of the spectrum, there is a distinctly different law enforcement role, although each role is a~fected by common issues and interests . From the national perspective) federal allocation of fU!Ads can affect significantly the emphasis placed upon issues by virtually all criminal justice agencies. Wh(lv. federal agencies such as the Department of Justice direct funds into a specific program area, many local agencies are then able to address that issue to a greater degree than their own funding will allow. Therefore, not only do the federal programs themselves have an impact upon particular areas, but the local agencies par- ticipating in the programs \"(Ul als~ necessarily have their \\ ' .~ .. Ithe local level, the police department directly affects the citizens in its own jurisdiction by the emphasis it places upon specific i~sues. Fiscal and manpower allocations are determined by the perceived needs of the community. In every community, various population groups, including older persons, compete for scarce law enforcement resources and services. At the same time, organized community groups, such as the service clubs and the Chamber of Commerce, help shape law en\u00ad forcement priorities to meet the needs of the community. Such community-based political action may eventually spread throughout the nation, affecting law enforcement priorities at the federal level. What must be done to develop a comprehensive law enforcement approach to deal with victimiza~ Ilion of the elderly? Any program which is going to be effective must necessal'i~y involve law enforce\u00ad ment personnel at all levels of the system-local, state, and national. Through\\a unified national ap\u00ad proach, a wide variety of programs can be developed which are mutually supportive in their efforts at confronting the problems older persons face. IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM A cursory look at the following four studies will aid in a diagnosis of the problem. Victimization of the elderly has been carefully measured in each s~J~dy ,~,nd a brief conclusion to each could appear as follows: ';. , 1. National Crime Survey In 1974 a National Crime Survey of crimes against persons and property showed that in\u00ad dividuals aged 65 and over experienced the lowest victimization of any age group. This was a survey that included all 50 states and the District of Columbia.3 2. Houston Model Neighborhood Area A 1974 study conducted by North Texas State: University showed that persons 65 and over were undervictimized in comparison to the general population of the Houston Model Neighborhood Area. Of alLcrimes committed, individuals 65 and over experienced a victimiza\u00ad tion rate approximately two-thirds that of the general population.4 3. Kansas City. Missouri A 1977 study of crime against the residents of Kansas City, Missouri was conducted by the Midwest Research Institute. This study compared crimes against persons aged 60 and over with crimes' against persons younger than 60. It showed that the total crime rate of older persons was approximately one-half that of p'ersons younger than 6O.s . 4. St. Petersburg. Florida The St. Petersburg Police Department has COilducted extensive age-related crime analyses. Over a four-yearperiod, beginning in 1974 and ending in 1977, reports have shown that while persons aged 60 and over made up 37 percent of the total population of St. Petersburg, only 16 percent of all crimes in this time period were committed against this lage group. This represents a victimization rate of less than one-half that of the general population.6 11-2 ~-~---'~-, ,,----,-,...----- , :)\\ \\\\, A Closer Look \\ Before any conclusions can be drawn from these studies, a more in-depth look is required. A com\u00ad prehensive analysis will identify severa] specific problem areas found repeatedly in these and other victimization studies: National Crime Survey The previously mentioned 1974 survey conducted by the National Crime Panel showed that persons aged 50 and over, while experiencing low overall victimization rates, were the second most frequent age group subjected to personal larceny with contact.

It is eiitremely fear-provoking; 2. It results in economic loss; 3. It may cause physical injury, oftenwith more long-term consequences to the older victim; and 4. It may result' in adverse behavioral changes for the .victim .. Each of t~ese c~n.?it~on~ is traumatic, especially to an older victim. (Lesson Three wIll examme the effects of victimization in greater detail.) The 1975 National Crime Survey indicated that persons 50 and over had significant increas,ies in crimes of violence and theft committed against them.8 / Age Group 12-15yr.old 16\u00b719 20-24 25-34 35\u00b749 50+ National Crime Survey: Change Victimization Rates, 1974\u00b71975 (percentage) Robbery Aggravated \" of Theft -5.0 1.5 .2 3.4 1.3 7.9 \\1.

By natural lifestyle they are less likely than younger persons to put themselves in high~risk situations. By imposed lifestyle, they are likely to change their habits and behavior, often remaining at home. 11-6 '-~'--'-~\"-'-'-\"'--'.:--'. -,: . J -\\ ..

In 1976, 71 percent of all pursesnatchings . were committep against women 60 and over, who constituted 20 percent of the population. Older persons were also . highly victimized by pick pocketing and robbery, again significant because of their decreased mobili\u00ad ty and accessibility as a target.

But yet in each example there are specific crime categories in which older pers(msare victimized disproportionate to their numbers. The Department of Justice, in its recent publication on crime victimization, clearly recognizes these very important realities.12 Thus, it is im\u00ad portant th~t law enforcement personnel adopt approaches which take these realities into account, as Lesson Four will explain.' 11-7 , , , --~.,.-------., Other studies reflect similar victimization trends. The following examples represent a wide disparity in geography and type of locality, and yet the findings are similar. 1. Oakland, California The University of California surveyed 320 victiIJ;ls of strongarm robbery and 190 Jpurse\u00ad snt.~tching victims in Oakland in, 1969. This study found that for both crime categories perso~s aged 65 and older wt\\re the most frequently victimized of any age g~oup.

Older persons experience low overall victimization by criminals, and 2. Most importantly, they are highly victimized by particular types of criminals. Th~ realization of ~hese points is crucial to effe~tive programming for o!;(Jer per\u00ad ~o~~ I? the comrtlUmty. The law enforcement officer, as a program implementer, has a kci3' role in ImtIatmg the changes necessary to confront these problems. ' A necessary step to program implementation is to clearly identify the crime problems within each ~pecific community. Such identification is brought about by crime analysis, which will be discussed In Lesson Four. A~o~h~r n~cessary step to program implementation is to accurately identify the causes and effects , of VIctImizatIon of the elderly. These concerns will be explored in Lessons Two and Three. SUMMARY While older persons experience the lowest overall victimization of any age group for certain crime categories they are overvictimized. ' ~lderly persons ~ost frequently are subjected to the crimes of personal larceny with contact and SWIndles: These. c~lmes ~ause trauma, economic losses, physical injuries, and negative behavioral changes In the VI~tIm. I~ IS necess?ry for law e~forcement personnel to recognize that the elderly sufi fer from these CrImes disproportIonate to their numbers in the general population. It is the responsibility of law enforcement personnel to implement programs to combat the criminal victimization of the elder(v. For program implementation to be effective, the law enforcement agency must conduct crime analysis within its own community and accurately identify the causes and effects of victimization of the elderly. 11-11 c REFERENCES \"(U blished manuscript, January 1 F A Rural Crime Prevention Cenler, npu 1 G Howard Phillips and Gary R.

U.S. Depar men , LESSON TWO CRIMJlS AFFECTING THE ELDERLY The crime problems affecting older persons today are pervasive throughout the United States and share common feature~. Lesson Two will identify these crimes and d.escribe the factors W'hich make elderly persons particularly Suscer.'tible to certai~ types of criminals. When 'analyzing data from vacle'us victimization studies, the following considerations should be kept in mind: Different studies use different age breakdo;ivns for measurement, purposes. For example, St. Petersburg, Florida considered the age of 6() as the beginning of their elderly category, while Oakland, California defined their elderly ~iltegory as age 65 and over. Each study has spechl circumstances surrounding it, such as sample size and characteristics of the area to be studied. For example, the B/ouston Model Neighborhood Area that was studied was a select area oriented toward providitl,lg services to older persons. A situation such as this can affect the type and frequency of cririle being reported. Such considerations are further tempered \"by the fact that no two jurisdictions are exactly alike. Each jurisdiction must consider its owp uniqllle situations When analyzing the crime problem. Even if the Uniform Crime Reports categorize the c!rime victims by age (as they do for murder), such find\u00adings do not reflect the specific problems of anyone are,a. In order to make reliable decisions for the delivery of crime prevention services to the elderly, pro\u00ad gram managers must receive reliable data af!.d info:rm~tion about the needs of older persons in their communities. It is vitally important that each loca\\it~ should determine its own crime problems. There are several common trends and tendencies for the criminal victimization of older persons. These trends and tendencies are best examined thro.'~gh the statistical techniques of rate and fre-quency, which are defined as follows: \" iI!I Crimes of Increased Rate: the frequency of occurrence as compared to the younger population's victimization (proportionately). Crimes of High Frequency: the frequency of Occurrence as compared to other crimes affecting older persons (numerically). 11-13 -Ii iil!\\!llllillM!\\M!I!IlIla Jldll,aaeZiti(JJl,QQQilliili.A\" .~.!:?~~;.,.\".;l,;..,;.,*\"!.\",~;;;:\",. , I ! .. \" !I \" CRIMES OF INCREASED RATE \" . . d t\" are robbery/pursesnatching and fraud/bunco.

This crime was cited as a serious ~roblem in six of the eight victimization studies described m Lesson One . Il-14 \", . . , .------------------ '. , . \" ,/ A pursesnatching usually is committed in the following manner: the assailant approaches the vic\u00ad tim from the rear and makes an iIi1mediate escape after seizing the purse. Little contact with the vic\u00ad tim is sought. The main advantage of this approach is speed of escape, with little or no identification of the perpetrator by the victim. The chance of bodily harm does exist though, since the assailant usually will not hesitate to. use force to seize the purse. Older women are disproportionately chosen as targets by the pursesnatcher for several reasons in addition to those previously discussed in connection with victimization by robbers: Their reaction time tends to be slower than that of younger persons; Pursuit of the assailant becomes more difficult, if not impossible with advancing age; and Older women tend to carry more items of value in their purses, including cash rather than checks or credit cards, than do younger women. Fraud and Bunco l'his is a crime category with infinite variations, such as flimflams, swindles, and confidence games. The National Criminal Justice Thesaurus, in its definition of confidence games, notes a charaqteristic common to fraud and bunco schemes in which older persons are victimized: \"A form of fraud in which advantage is taken of the confidence the victim reposes in the swindler\" .2 The Federal Bureau of Investigation recognizes in its description of confidence games that winn\u00ad ing is dependent upon the confidence the victim places in the con artist. 3 \" It is generally agreed that fra'ld and bunco schemes are frequently committed against older per- sons. The California Crime Prevention Division of the Attorney General's Office estimated in 1973 that 90 percent of the victims of the pigeon drop scheme (see definitions, page 18) were older per\u00ad sons. Of all medical fraud cases that came to the attention of the Division, 70 percent involved older victims.4 This is not to say that fraud and bunco is a crime that is exclusively perpetrated against older per\u00ad sons.s Businessmen and professionals often are victims of fraudulent investment schemes, as they usually have the interest and the means to invest, but are not knowledgeable of the investment en\u00ad vironment and are therefore very susceptible to fraud, as the following examples illustrate: Wall Street bankers and investment counselors were bilked in the $200 million Oklahoma Homestake Oil Company swindle; Five bank presidents -all fired because of unwise investments -were drawn into the $40 million Washington-New York wine swindle; and' A businessman looking for diversification received a wad of paper worth five dollars when he invested $35,000 in a computer dating franchise. ' II-15 .1 .i I -~----------- ~---- While it is impossible to generalize across such a heterogeneous group, some older persons have psychological characteristics which make them particularly susceptible to specific kinds of fraudulent schemes. These characteristics are brought about by a variety of situations, but primarily include seven common factors: 1. Loneliness: Many older persons do not often have a chance to talk with others. A friendly, smooth-talking con artist provides a real opportunity for conversation itself, not to mention the fantastic opportunity to mruce or save some money. 2. Grief: The loss of close friends or relatives causes people to seek alternatives as replacements. The .older person tends to lose those alternatives as the people who made up his world pass on. This opens up the door to a variety of con artists who are glad to share, if only temporarily, the emotions and feelings of the individual. Religious schemes and fortune-telling/medium opera\u00ad tions are big business by virtue of this search for replacement. 3, Depression: The feeling of lost self-worth which many older persons experience can cause a generally depressed state of being. Frantic efforts toward image rebuilding often lack the nor\u00ad mal judgment and caution found in sound decision-making. A con artist can present to the depressed older person the opportunity to be of real use again. A successful con artist will find such people useful again and again. 4. Sensory impairment: Some con games, such as the pigeon drop, rely on sleight of hand to be successful. Fraudulent contracts which sell to or take from the victim more than he bargained for do so in the small print. The older person who cannot easily read small print, or who has difficulty hearing oral explanations, may be too embarrassed or proud to ask for clarification. Additionally, sleight of hand becomes easier to use when dealing with a person who cannot see well to begin with. 5. Illness and pain: Anyone who experiences illness or pain seeks relief. For the older person, the consequences of these problems may be absolute; thus, the need for relief is amplified. A fran\u00ad tic search for help may lead the older person to the con artist who has the \"miracle cure\" that conventional (legitimate) doctors \"don't want to use.\" Snake oil is found in all shapes and sizes. 6. Avarice: This is a characteristic found in many people, but for the older person time is running out. Opportunities which arise could be the last chance, and many swindles and confidence games require immediate action or the chance will be lost. The older person can't afford to pass it up and, unfortunately, many don't. 7. Non-acceptance of aging: Madison Avenue seems to tell us that it is undesirable to be old in America. Such distaste for aging may cause older persons to search for cures for the symptoms of aging or for the aging process itself. Such \"cures\" are in ready supply.6 Beyond these seven situations is the economic reality that many older persons are retirees o:n fixed incomes. In 1977 only 13 percent of persons aged 65 ~md older were in the work force-either work\u00ad the value of a fixed retirement income limited savings to offset the infl~tiona~~~ectsls~:ct~:e~l!~ft ~~sons a~e ~~ious to increas~ th~ir approaching investment chances to :nake easy money ;~~r~~se e ne~e:sary cautIon 10 ~~i~! ~~~~:' benefits, assets easU; Fina~l~, many ~lder p~rsorlS, especially women, live alone. This mea~s that they do not have a sec\u00ad ~n~ \u00b0fmlOn readIly avaIlable, and many fraudulent schemes require immediate action as part of the t;a. ~ :ev;re ca~es, t~e older person who is n1)t in the social mainstream may become detached to e polO 0 not nowmg the cost of repairs or the true value of his property. Successful con artists ~re astute students of human behavior. They are experts in the a lied kno;ledge Of/~~ to ~~mpulate people to go along with their schemes. They exploit the desir~: and wea . nesses 0 t elr vIctIms. They are convincing and ingenious, and often very charming. The ~on artist uses a variety of methods to select potential victims. Some of these methods are: Random, person-to-person contacts; Indiscriminate, house-tQ-house canvassing; Mailing using list acquired from another group; A \"soft touch\" mailing list acquired from a legitimate charitable or religious organization; Offering. prizes to people to induce them to suggest names of their friends who might b . terested 10 the \"product\"; . e 10- SU?tdlel probing by the bunco artist of local people in order to elicit names of likely subJ' ects for a swm e; ~ames from newspape~ articl~s: ~or example, the con artist calls the victim and says \"I see by t e paper that you are mterested 10 someone to repair your driveway;\" N~mfe~dfdrom thl e .obituary columns, tipping off the CQn artist to the names and addresses of gne -n en re atIves; ~~~aal/e'nlsOPOekc~~onf~f nl.ekig1hborhoOds by roof repair, driveway repair, or home repair defrauders Illg or ley prospects; Checking. ~hone books for people having unusual Biblical first names: such charactenstIc of some older people; and names are Female~\\ listed in phone books or on mail boxes, which indicates that they may live alone.9 11-17 , ; I In short, the con artist is astute and clever. He can find victims for his fraudulent schemes among any segment of the population. Older people happen to have many of the characteristics he is look\u00ad ing for. There is no way, short of isolation, to prevent a con artist from contacting an older person as a potential victim. The efforts of law enforcement officers should be focused on a response to that in\u00ad evitability. Bunco sch~mes include a variety of fraudulent and deceptive crimes. There are estimated to be over 800 varieties. 10 Although there are regional variances in fraud/bunco schemes which local law enforcement agencies should document for themselves, the following examples are standard for~ mats from which other schemes and frauds are drawn. 1. Bank Examiner. The bank examiner scheme usually is performed by a three-person team and occurs as follows: The team pinpoints bank locations on a map within a certain target area. They go through the telepl.ione directory to underline listings of women's names.ll Then they single out a vic\u00ad tim, usually a woman, who lives alone and who is unlikely to discuss the scheme with some\u00ad one el~e; The first team member makes an initial telephone call, verifies the identity of the victim's bank, and informs the intended victim that a bank official will be calling shortly; The second con artist -impersonating a bank official- telephones to obtain the victim's correct bank balance, to advise the intended victim that a number of bank accounts have some suspicious withdrawals, and to persuade her to withdraw money to help trap a suspected dishonest employee; The third member of the con team serves as a bag man who, displaying forged credentials, collects the money withdrawn from the bank by the victim. This scheme often is easy to accomplish because the con artists prey on the victim's civic pride and duty and point out to her a personal interest since her own money is in the bank. , 2. Pigeon Drop. The pigeon drop scheme, like the bank examiner fraud, usually targets women -often older women -as prime victims. The typical pigeon drop scheme operates as follows: A pigeon drop team usually consists of a racial mix, or a team that isn't apparently working together; 12 An elderly person is approached by one member of the con team. As they talk, the second member of the team plants a package of money and then joins the conversation by inquiring whether or not the money belongs to either of them; A note is pulled from the package of money and shown to the intended victim. The note in\u00ad duces the victim to think that the money has been gained by illicit means - or will be used for illicit purposes -and that the finders should keep the /' :: I The con artist holding the money offers to consult his \"boss\" or \"lawyer\" to ask what to do with the money. He reports back that the three can split the money. However, they will have to withdraw money from the bank to show good faith and to prove that they will not spend the money found until the \"boss\" has worked out some legal procedures; and The accomplice, pretending not to know the finder, produces money and urges the victim to do the same. The victim withdraws savings and shows the money to the con artists. They place it in an envelope and, in a fast switch, give the victim ari envelope stuffed with nothing but paper. 3. Home Repair Fraud. J'he older homeowner is frequently victimized by home improvement or home repair frauds. These take many forms. A typical home repair. switldle operates as follows: \"Workmen\" approach an older homeowner -they-point out a home repair need; They confide to the homeowner that they have just finished a job nearby, have material left over, and can do the repair for only a fraction of the actual cost, since the material was already paid for; Their line may go something like: \"We don't have to return that oil. We can ifix your roof, make a couple extra dollars for ourselves, and save ~ou some money;\" The homeowner allows the workmen to do the job -by allowing them to use materials someone else paid for, he may feel c.ompromised; and The homeowner pays the. workmen; but the material used is inferior and deteriorates very soon afterward,13 .:1/. The Building Inspector. The inspector scheme also victimizes homeowners, often older per\u00ad sons. The typical building inspector or home inspector scheme operates as follows: A con artist poses and appears at the door as an \"inspector\" -unknown, unsummoned, and displaying false credentials. He informs the homeowner that he is making a routine in\u00ad spection and gains entrance to the home; After his inspection, he declares that the house is unsafe, placing the homeowner in an ex\u00ad tremely frightening or uncomfortable situation. For example, he may tell the homeowner that the water must be turned off immediately because the hot water heater is unsafe; and The \"inspector\" knows someone (a plumber, for example) who can do the repair. The \"repair\" is arranged and performed at an exorbitant fee.14 5. Sales Frauds. Some sales fraud perpetrators find older persons to be particularly vulnerable and susceptible to their fraudulent approach. A typical sales fraud operates as followS:15 The \"salesman\" begins with this statement, \"Mrs. Anderson, I know you already have a hearing aid, but I get 10 dollars from my company for every demonstration I give. Won't you let me show our product to you?\" 11-19 I The \"company\" may have bestowed on the salesman the title of hearing aid audiologist, 16 and may conduct some form of hearing test as part of the demonstration; and In one case, the salesman had an older woman in her eighties sign a piece of paper, which he pretended was a statement from her that he had performed the demonstration. In reality, he had her sign a contract for a $175 hearing aid which she did not need. 6. Medical Quackery. Older persons are frequently victims of fraudulent medical or quick-cure schemes. Fake laboratory tests, \"miracle\" cures, and offers of free medical diagnoses often trap the older personinto expensive, long-term, and useless treatments. 7. \"Work At Home\" Frauds. One newspaper advertisement drew more than 200,000 applicants in response to a fraudulent offer. Applicants, in order to qualify, had to send a. small registra\u00ad tion fee and perform a sewing task to demonstrate their skill. No one qualified and no money was returnedP 8. Mail Frauds. The U.S. Postal Service categorizes the wide variety of mail frauds as: consumer frauds, business opportunity frauds, medical frauds, and self-improvement frauds. IS Mail frauds often victimize old and lonely persons who may value and read carefully a piece of mail which a younger person would discard as junk mail. While these eight schemes are found nationwide, the law enforcement officer must become aware of the schemes and ploys in his individual area, since new twists to the basics lire found in each area. A successful community education program to prevent' fraud and bunco victimization must include a review of the psychology of the victim/perpetrator interaction, which surfaces a spirit of larceny by the victim in order for the scheme to be accomplished. Discussion of that fact after community arousal produces negative results for effective police involvement in community education and problem solving. CRIMES OF HIGH FREQUENCY Crimes of high frequency involving older persons as victims include burglary and vandalism (especially when the older persons live in a community with a large population of teenagers). Burglary As is the case with any age group, burglary is one of the most frequent crimes committed against older persons. It is not necessarily an age-related crime, but is usually determined in type and fre\u00ad quency by the locale. Burglary was cited, however, as a serious problem for older persons in the Detroit victimization study described in Lesson One. Most burglaries are committed by adolescents who usually live near the targeted residence. The typical burglar is not a hardened criminal; rather, he is most often one of the neighborhood kids. For this reason and the fact that the victim rarely is present during the commission of the crime, there is usually little danger of physical harm to the victim. However, real danger exists if the victim is present or arrives at home while the burglary is being committed. The average burglar does not 11-20 ----- ---~ to hav~ any Itontact with the victim, but because of his youth and inexperience, he can be un\u00ad predictable if he is discovered. In many cases older persons live either in public housing projects or in older houses. Security measures in public housing projects are often lax or non-existent.I9 Projects are often placed in close proximity to the criminals who prey upon them. This provides the burglar with a variety of accessi\u00ad ble targets in one convenient location. An older house very often has many points of entry because it was designed in an era when crime was less of a problem. The property surrounding an older house may have many overgrown trees and shrubbery. This foliage pr,ovides excellent cover for the burglar entering the house. Burglary is a nationw~de crime problem that does not seem to seek out older persons as victims more than anyone else. However, one characteristic about older persons does make them attractive targets to the burglar. While they may not necessarily rJwn more expensive possessions, they do tend to keep larger sums of cash in the house. This is p-l!'tkularly advantageous to the burglar, since cash is easy to carry and is immediately available for use upon possession. Finally, the older victim usual\u00ad ly has followed a distinguishable pattern of travel for a long period of time. This makes it relatively easy for a burglar to determine the most opportune time to break into the house. Vandalism Older persons very frequently are the target of this crime. In a 1977 study of victimization of the elderly in Montgomery County, Maryland, vandalism was found to be one of the most frequent crimes committed against older persons.20 Adolescents are almost exclusively the perpetrators of vandalism. They choose their targets for a variety of reasons and, in the case of older victims, one of those reasons is increased social isolation. Many older persons in a mixed community will withdraw from social contacts in their neighborhood more than the average resident would.21 Whether by choice or fear, this withdrawal tends to make them \"outsiders\" in the eyes of a vandal, and a choice target for destruction of property. The older residents usually have lived in their homes for many years. This extended length of residency brings about a greater concern for the sanctity of their house and property. The surround\u00ad ing environment assumes an importance to older persons not often found in the younger popula\u00ad tion.22 Therefore, juveniles in the neighborhood may be violating the defensible territory of an older person by taking a shortcut across the lawn. This action, which is perfectly normal to the juvenile, may cause a forceful reaction from the older resident. This can antagonize the juvenile to the point of retaliation, frequently by vandalism. Other Crimes Other crimes in which older persons are victims include assault, auto theft, and murder. However, the elderly are not frequent victims of these crimes, compared to other age groups. Assault. Most assaults do not occur against older persons. Proportionately, they are under\u00ad victimized by this crime. Due to the nature of the crime, an indeterminate number of assaults are 11-21 I' I' victim-induced to the point that there is essentially no difference in the culpability of the victim and the offender. 23 However, this is usually not the case with older assault victims. Many do not know their assailant, which is unusual for this crime. St. Petersburg, Florida, ~olice found that in 38 per\u00ad cent of the assaults on an older victim, it was a stranger-to-stranger confrontation, an usually high percentage when compared to the stranger-to-stranger confrontations within the general popula- ~~ . Auto Theft. While this is a crime that rapidly is increasing in the general population, it is not a seri'ous problem for the elderly. This is due primarily to less ownership of vehicles by this age 'group, plus greater precantionary measures which are typical of the cautionary acts found with the aging process. M.urder. In both rate and frequency, older persons are victims of this crime far less than average. The frequency of murder is low for all ages, but the rate of murder decreases steadily as the age group gets older. This is the one crime that the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports classify by the age of the victim. The following table of incidents for 1978 reflects the low victimization rate for older per\u00ad sons. As is shown, persons 65 and older represented 5.9 percent of the murder victims for that year, but yet make up 10.9 percent of the total population.25 1 / .- ..... J, ----~~--~~~----~-----------------------------------. Q; 41 d\"X ,.' 'I I ' I \" , (::~ ,,/ ,I ---,,, ~ap~. This is another crime which rarely occ~rs ag~h'!st an older person. The frequency of this crIme ~s very .lo~ overall. Most vic.tims are young wgrr(im. These two factors make an older woman ~ ~nhkely VIctIm of rape. In one m-depth study of rapists who choose older victims, the offenders, mdlcated no love, respect, or admiration for their parents. Instead, physical and/or emotional abuse ~ended to be the patt~rn.26 The rapist who preys upon older women generally shows severe ?IaladJ~stment patterns and IS, fortunately, a rare entity. Nationwide, the occurrence of elderly rape IS very mfrequent, as the following chart shows:27 Estimated Rate (per 100,000 persons 12 years or older) of Attempted and Actual Rapes, by Age of Victim - United States 1976 Age of Victim Rate Per 100,000 12 -15 105 16 -19 209 20 -24 259 25 -34 123 35 I? The International Association of G'irlefs of Police conducted a survey of 180 police\" and s?eriff departments to determine the crime problems older persons face, as seen by law enforcement Itself. The survey results, as shown below, parallel closely the findings presented earlier in the lesson.28 7 I\u00b7 Senior Citizen Victimization and its Prevention Crime Forcible rape Robbery Aggravated assault Burglary Pocket picking or plirse snatching Theft of income checks (Le. social security welfare, etc.) Theft of motor vehicles Theft of recreational equipment or bicycles Theft from motor vehicle Confidence games and deceptive flractices Embezzlement Intimidation Telephone harrassment Vandalism Arson Other .~ Most Frequent Crime Victims 2 (1%) 66 (37%) 20 (11%) 122 (68%) 0 5 11-24 Prevention Needed (3%) (32%) (8%) 102 (57%) , , . FACTORS INFLUENCING VICTIMIZATION The older person is vulnerable to many different crime situations. This vulnerability is greater than in other age groups due to personal and environmental factors, and contributes to the increas\u00ad ed victimization previously discussed. Vulnerability factors can be categorized into the following areas: Physical; Psychological; Environmental; and Situational Physical Factors As part of the aging process, the physical capabilities and sensory perceptions of older persons decline. This increases their chances of victimization becaUSe: 1. They are less aware of their surroundings. They: May not see or hear approaching danger; May not be aware of an initial contact with an attacker and thus be unable to react; May not be able to identify the offender if he is apprehended; and t' May not be able to read and understand the terms of a fraudulent contract. 2. They have experienced a loss of muscular coordinating capabilities. They: Are less able to defend themselves from attack; Are less likely to retaliate with physical force; Are less likely to pursue an assailant; and Are less able to protect their property from attack. 3. They have reduced reaction times. They: May not react to a crime situation immediately; and Are less able to understand a fast-talking bunco artist. Psychological Factors Aga~n due to the aging process and the circumstances which surround it, older persons experience psychological problems which contribute to their vulnerability to criminal acts. This increased vulnerability occurs because: 1. They may be pre-occupied with economic, physical, or other personal problems. This preoc\u00ad cupation would reduce their internal warning signals of a danger situation, such as with a bun\u00ad co artist or potential attacker. 2. They may periodically lose contact with the immediate situation. While this is dangerous in the street environment, it also provides the bunco artist with an easier mark t9 exploit. 11-25 , / . \\ 3 They may be lonely. They may welcome a stranger into their homes for the opportunity of . conversation, and unknowingly invite physical harm or property Joss. 4. They may be depressed. T~is can significantly alter ~he behavio~ ?f an otherwise normal per\u00ad son, and cause them to make erratic and often detrimental decIsIons .. 5. They may be afraid. The fear of reprisal will affect the r.eporting of the crime to police. 6 They may be more trusting. This is a luxury many of us can no l~nger affor~, a~d it can be ex\u00ad . tremely difficult for older persons to adjust to an attitude of warmess, considermg the era they grew up in. Environmental Factors Many older persons live in central city areas, where crime is rampant. In 1970, 34 percent of per\u00ad sons aged 65 and over lived in central cities.29 These elderly persons have either been unable or unwilling to move ou~ of the Qld~r neighborhoods, or they have been placed there by a social welfare program. In eIther case, theIr chances of being victimized are increased because: 1. Central cities are generally high-crime areas with inadequate police protection. 2. As neighborhoods change, the older residents become more isolated from the mainstream. 3. They may have to rely on public transportation thro~gh areas. they would normally avoid, and must stand at transportation stops for extended periods of tune. 4. They are more likely to be victimized by criminals repeatedly. Much of the crime problem is area-related, and definite patterns develop. Situational Factors Older persons are more likely than their younger counterparts to live alone. This has negative con\u00ad sequences in the following areas: 1. They face a greater risk of physical attack, and have less of an ability to adequately defend themselves. 2. No one is present to protect their homes 01 property. when they leave .the hous~ even for short periods. 3. They have little opportunity for consulting others concerning possible fraud, when being pressed for immediate decisions. ' 11-26 . . , f / \" , \" ~ ... ; \"',i Further, older persons tend to maintain a routine in their daily activities with much more regulari\u00ad ty than the general population. 3o These routine patterns are easily identified and, as a result, their major activities ate easily discernible to criminals. Because of this: 1. The robber knows when the older person is carrying large amounts of cash (such as for groceries) and the route he will be taking to the store or to his home. 2. The burglar knows when and for how long the older person's house or apartment will be va\u00ad cant. 3. The con artist knows the best times and places to \"accidentally\" encounter the older person. THE OFFENDER PROFILE In nearly every case the criminal offender is an opportunist, evident by the significant success of effective crime prevention programs. The older person presents an excellent target for the offender. It is no coincidence that 90 percent of the \"pigeons\" in the pigeon drop swindles in California are 65 or 0Ider.3! Youthful muggers in New York call their attacks on older pen lOllS \"crib jobs\"-the equivalent of taking candy from a baby.32 In nearly every case the criminal offender is an opportunist. A determination of a \"typical of\u00ad fender\" can be made only from an available data base. From a national perspective, such data is generally derived from large metropolitan population areas. Profiles determined from such data are useful when speaking in general terms; however, each locale must identify its criminal population through local crime analysis. Except where noted, the following statistics are derived from the 1978 Sourcebook o/Criminal Justice Statistics. The percentages given apply to the national average and include all known criminal offenses against all age categories.33 Robbery The typical robber is: 15 to 21 years old in 53.8 percent of all robberies; Male in 93.0 percent of all robberies; and Black in.59.0 percent of all robberies. Pu..sesnatching This crime is classified differently by each police department and, even within one jurisdiction, circumstances surrounding the crime will place it in different classifications. The Sourcebook 0/ Criminal Justice Statistics does not list this crime separately. 11-27 --, -. __ , . However, the Wilmington, Delaware Crime Analysis Project did construct an offender profile for the combination of street robberies and pursesnatchings and attempts to commit either of these crimes.34 Their analysis determined that for these crimes the offender was: 13 to 21 years old in 85 percent of 174 samples; Male in 96 percent of 203 samples; and Black in 92 percent of 203 samples. Aggravated Assault The typical perpetrator of assault is: 17 to 2;~ years old in 52.4 percent of all assaults. (aggravated); Male in 89.7 percent of all assaults (aggravated); and White in 50.8 percent of all a~saults (aggravated). . ~ Violent Crime This category includes the crimes of murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. The typical perpetrator of a violent crime is: 15 tc 24 years old in 52.9 percent of violent crimes; Male in 89.7 percent of violent crimes; and White in 50.8 percent of violent crimes. Vandalism Tlie typical vandal is: 11 to 17 years old in 57.4 percent of vandalisms; Male in 92.0 percent of vandalisms; and . White in 83.2 percent of vandalisms. Burglary The typical burglar is: 15 to 20 years old in 52.3 percent of all burglaries; Male in 94.6 percent of all burglaries; and White in 69.8 percent of all burglaries. Fraud .and Bunco As stated earlier, ther is no single description of a bunco artist. There are at least as many descrip\u00ad tions as there are bunco schemes. Howeverr the FBI, in its \"Portrait of the Confidence Man,'\" has defined some qualities that swindlers share:3s Totally lacks conscience and mercy toward free from remorse; } '\\ Lacks affection or empathy for others; Intelligent, affable, and is a skilled salesman; Winning personality; shrewdness, agility, and a sense of timing; and, A good actor at home in any number of roles. The last point is extremely important in describing the con artist. His ability and intelligence allow him to be virtually anyone, and therefore he defies physical description. This problem is com\u00ad pounded by the reality that very few bunco artists are apprehended . THE OLDER OFFENDER \". ,. The older offender has received very little attention from either the law enforcement community or the many criminolpgical research studies. This lack of attention is due primarily to the negligible over-all older offendbr problem; however, there are some crime areas in which the involvement of older offenders is statistically significant. St. Petersburg, Florida Police have noted one category that has become a problem-shoplifting by older persons. Out of 88,000 persons aged 60 or over, a total of 1,401 were involved in criminal activity from 1974 to 1977. Of the 1,401, over one-half (728) were charged with shoplifting. For total crimes committed by older offenders in St. Petersburg, the typical offender was a white (80 percent) male (69 percent). For shoplifting the typical offender was also a white (93 percent) male (57 per\u00ad cent).36 Huntington, West Virginia Police conducted an analysis of arrests from January through June of 1975. Their findings, shown in the following table, indicate that person 60 and over constituted 7.8 percent of adult arrest.

SUMMARY Certain types of crimes present serious problems to older persons; therefore, police programs must be directed against prevention of these offenses. The crimes which represent the most serious problems to older persons are robbery, pursesnat\u00ad ching, fraud/bunco, burglary, and vandalism. Older persons have a low victimization rate for the crimes of assault, murder, and rape; however, each time an older person is a victim of one of these crimes, injury or death results and the experience is traumatic. Inspection of police incident reports often reveals that the serious crimes of assault, murder, and rape against elderly persons often result as an escalation of a lesser offense, such as burglary or pursesnat.:hing. Therefore, police programs aimed at deterring the lesser offenses against the elderly will further s,erve to reduce the more serious offenses. In order to effectively plan and implement programs to prevent the victimization of eldel'ly per\u00ad sons, police must be aware of the factors which contribute to the victimization of the elderly and analyze the presence of these contributory factors within their own communities. Vulnerability factors can be categorized into the following areas: physical, psychological, en\u00ad vironmental, and situational. These vulnerability factors touch virtually every facet of the lives of older persons. The best of efforts simply cannot change many of these factors, but law enforcement officers should be aware of the contributing circumstances and plan their programs and operations accordingly. An awareness of these factors which contribute to the victimization of the elderly serves to explain victimization from an overall point of view, but each police department must analyze the presence of these factors at its individual community level in order to plan effective pro\u00ad grams. The perpetration oj criminal acts is very much age-related. Offender profiles indicate that the majority of cri;runals who victimize older persons are between the ages of 15 and 21 (robbery, pursesnatching, and burglary). There are no readily available of\u00ad fender age breakdowns for such white-collar crimes as fraud and bunco; however, the talent necessary to commit such crimes can be found in all age groups. The older offender does not present a significant problem for police, with the exception of shoplifting, white-collar crimes, and alcohol\u00ad related crimes. Il-32 \\ / REFERENCES 1. u.s.

'I Lesson Three IMP ACT OF ~RIME Among criminal justice system personnel, there is a fairly universal understanding of what a crime 'is and how it is committed. In Lesson Two the major crime types affecting older persons were described; law enforcement officers nationwide are\u00b7 able to immediately recognize and define these crimes. While Classifications may vary, major crime typologies are one of the few consistencies within our fragmented system. Therefore, the event described by the statement that an older person \"is the victim of a burglary\" is not subject to a wide range of interpretations-a clear concept of that situation exists. . What at\u20ac-not so clear, however, are the ramifications of the incident to the victim. While this is true for ail age groups, Lesson Three is concerned only with the older person and the special prob\u00ad lems he encounters as a victim of crime. The three aspects of concernme~ The economic impact of victimization. The physical injuries from criminal attack. The psychological trauma of exposure to crime. All oldefc.persons who are the victims of crime are affected by at least one of these aspects. Many crimes, however, such as a strong-arm robbery or pursesnatching, can affect an older victim in all three areas. Further, because of the widespread differences which exist among members of the older population, one person may be mOre severely affected economically, physically, or psychologically than another victi.r'l of a similar criminal act. THE MOST FORGOITEN VICTIM The criminal justice system in America has established various levels of priorities. Through the ef\u00ad forts of a great many dedicated individuals, the level of concern in the United States for the juvenile delinquent, the adult offender, and prisoners has risen tremendously from the early 1900s to today. The rights of juvenile and adult offenders, as well as the .rights of inmates, are well established, and voluminous amounts of research are conducted into each of these areas.,. However, notably lacking suff;cient attention are the rights of the victims and the demands the criminal ju~tice system places upon them. Nevertheless, the burdens placed upon the victim do not stop with the crime itself. . . c The judicial process requires the victim to assist iI~ the prosecution of the offender, pndergo cross\u00ad examination, and bear whatever costs are incur~ed (transportation, leave frorn work, etc.) throughout what is often a lengthy legal proces&\\ since the defense often seeks numerous postponements. 2 c \\ . D 11-35 , I I ! J , ! ! I \\ I :! ; ~ = =-\" The irony is that the victim will undergo this only if fortune allows for the apprehension and prosecution by trial of the offender. If not, the crime and its victim merely become statistics. For the older victim, a/l of the negative consequences of the system are accented. The heightened impact of the crime further intensifies the anxiety-producing adversary relationship in the court\u00ad room arena. Testimony and cross-examination tend to be more taxing for the older victims, and can significantly increase an already high fear level. The courtroom setting provides little of the emo\u00ad tional support the older person requires, and the likelihood of the defendant's short incarceration period or outright release on probation will heighten the elderly victim's fear of reprisal. Recognition of the undue demands placed upon older'ictims by the criminal justice system has helped bring about some responses by criminal justice administrators and legislators, who have been developing programs to attempt to give needed support to the older person. Such programs include: ---- --~- Victim Compensation: many states have either adopted victim compensation legislation or are in the process of developing it. Further, some of the federal funding priorities seem to be mov\u00ad ing in this direction and, if the trend continues, much more will be done for the victim in ~he future. Presently, the remuneration benefits allowed by most state statutes are very limited, often covering only a portion of the victim'S medical costs.3 Victim Witness Assistance: many jurisdictions are instituting this program for the procedural and emotional support of the victim or witness throughout the criminal justice process. This support generally is carried out by community volunteers who work in conjunction with either the police department or the pro,secutor's office.4 ECONOMIC LOSS The average income of older persons is in many cases fixed and, according to recent Department of Commerce data, is much lower than that of the general population.s Of the 23 million Americans over age 65 in 1976, 15 percent were below the poverty level.6 There are even greater differences in income between the older women and the general popula\u00ad tion.7 The low participation of women in the labor force in the earlier years of the century -those who are 65 or older today -is disallowing many older women from benefiting from pensions and requir- ing increased dependence on Social Security income. - , \" Regardless of the source, the fixed incomes of the elderly are seriously affected by inflation which has become part of our economic system. Each year the value of the dollar decreases; hence: 11-36 -', \" 1 \\ o , . Q the purc?asing.power of the older consumer on the fixed income decli~es. The following table illus\u00ad trates thiS declIne over a lO-year period, using a hypothetical inflation rate of 10 percent: Year Face Value Actual Worth Yearly Purchasing Power Loss 1 $3,600.00 $3,600.00 cost-of-living adjustments on a fixed Social Security income occur only once a yea~. ThiS annual adjustment method requires approximately seven months into the new adjustment period to compensate fully the losses from the prior year's inflation. Because of this the retiree most likely will have to draw upon cash reserves just tq keep pace with his current standa~d of living. An unexpected loss from a robbery or burglary will further strain the cash reserves of a retiree. As ,a family's (or individual's) income level decreases, their chances of being victimized increases. The following table shows victimization rate increases by burglary, assault, and robbery in relation to decreases from a hypothetical family income of $12,500.8 11-37 J\\ n II II i I I 'I I J If \\l I o I> ___ ~ II Proportionate Change in Victimization By Change in Family Income of $12,500 Burglary X 4.6 (l -3.0 Assault X Robbery X 24.5 $12,5000 -30% 8.5 24.1 19.8 67.3 45.7 Family Income of $12,590 N'\" ( This increase in victimization rates occurs because a family which continues to lose income most often must move to cheaper housing, usually located in high~crime areas. Thus, the family finds itself caught in a vicious trap. \" The elderl~ poor not only experience this increased victimization, but the percentage of income they lose each time they are victimized is a significantly greater part of their total income. , The Kansas City victimization study mentioned in Lesson One pointed out that with an. over?ll median income of only $3,000 per year, older victims suffered severe consequences fro~ fman~lal losses. Losses were computed as a percentage of one month's income to determine Im~edIate impacts; overall, victims of all ages lost 23 percent of a month's income. Bu~ i~ the lower mcome categories, losses were over 100 percent. In many cases, these losses forced victims to cut b~ck on basic necessities.9 [i J' . The eiderly poor are the favored targets of much criminal activity and the (~ffects of\\~uch activity are devastating to the victims. 11-38 1 I \" ,-\" l \"\" ':\"'\" / \\ On the one hand, the actual percentage of income lost by older victims often is great~r. Even if the percentages were equal throughout all income levels, the low-income victim who suffers monetary losses must often sacrifice necessities such as food and clothing. The high-income victim may sacrifice luxuries and non-essential goods, and perhaps can tap other resources to distribute the financial loss over a longer period. However, the reality is that poor people lose a higher percenta.ge of their income when they are victimized. By the same tok~n, fixed income is very hard to replace wQen it\u00b7 is lost. As the previous table showed, the value of fixed income declines over time. After victimization, the remaining resources must be stretched to make ends meet. Such options as working overtime or at a part-time job are simply not available to many older persons. The monetary losses suffered by older victims can increase tbeir chances for future victimization. These losses can either force an older person to move to cheaper housing or trap him in such housing if he is already there. Cheaper housing is very often found in high-crime areas, and this exposes the older person to even greater criminal activity. The deprivation caused by victimization can have other negative results for the older person. Malnutrition, increased exposure to the elements, and seriously curtailed activities are all possibilities. Along with these problems are the psychological effects of victimization and its impact upon the community. PHYSICAL INJURY The aging process causes a general deterioration in bodily capabilities and resiliency. The rate of physical deterioration depends upon the individual and the care he takes of his body. Physical deterioration with age is a reality for everyone. The U. S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare report~ these facts about elderly health and health care: 10 c\u00b7 \" Chronic physical problems are more prevalent among older persons than younger persons. In 1976, about 39 percent of older persons were limited in their major activity (working or keeping house) due to physical impairments, as compared to only seven percent of younger persons. In 1976, about 18 percent of the 65 and older age group had an interference with their mobility due to chronic physical conditions -six percent had some trouble getting around alone; seven percent needed a mechanical aid to get around; and five percent were homebound. )/ In 1976, older people had about a one-in-six chance of being hospitalized during a year, higher than for persons under age 65 (1 in to). Among those hospitalized d,uring the year, thepropor\u00ad tion with more than one stay was greater for older persons than for younger persons (26 percent vs. 15 percent) and the average length of stay was about five days longer (11.6 vs. 6.9 days). On the average, older people had more physician visits than did persons under age 65 (6.9 vs. 4.7 visits) in 1976, and a. higher p,roportion had visited a doctor within the last six months (70 percent vs. 58 percent). 'I, 11-39 , The fact is that people become more frail with age. Bones become brittle and wounds take longer to heal. All other things being equal, when an older person is injured as opposed to a younger per- son, three consequences will result. . , 1. The injury will be more serious; 2. The injury will take longer to heal; and 3. The injury will disrupt normal activities to a greater degree. The older victim who is the target of a personal crime is much more likely to be injured than is a younger person. For example, the Kansas City study found that 15 percent of all older crime victims (including victims of property crimes) were physically injured. I I The Wilmington study revealed that 41 percent of older victims of street crimes sustained injuries.I2 Another problem is the severity of the injuries administered to older persons by criminals. Con\u00ad gressman Claude Pepper of Florida, at a meeting of the House Select Committee on Aging, made the following observation of this severity:I3 \"Criminal victimization of the elderly has radically altered and restricted the lifestyles of elderly people. The 'Golden Years,' as we like to say, have become years of terror for millions of elderly who are virtual prisoners in their own homes. Americans are doomed to live out the remainder of their lives afraid to go to the grocery store, afraid to go to church on Sunday, or on their Sabbath. For too many, the grisly alternative is a brutal death at the hands of someone who sees the aged as an easy mark.\" The Human Resources Commission of New York City observed:I4 \"It used to be that the money was taken away from them and they were left alone. Now, many people a.re being beaten even though they've given their money freely.\" And the New York City Housing Authority reported:I5 \"We have noticed in a ~mall number of cases -but an increasing number of cases -that the physical injury has been intentional. Broken arms, legs, dislocated hips, striking about the face and head after the money was taken, either because the robber is disappointed in the amount of money he gets or is venting his frustration on a helpless victim.\" The older 'Victim, because of his decreased physical resilience and the inability of his body to heal, will often suffer injuries that are sustained for the remainder of his life, The New York Office For the Aging states that it is quite likely that the older person will never fully recover from an injury aria will carry it with him to his grave.I6 Indeed, many victims have had their life-span considerably shortened due to injuries. The increased physical impairment brought about by the aging process can lead to greater vulnerability to crime. A disability makes the older person an even easier target for an assailant. A physical disability, particularly one which significantly restricts walking about, climbing on buses, and getting into cars complicates adjustment to the environment for the older person. The Kansas City study disclosed that 20 percent of the victims involved in the study had some visible physical handicap that Impaired their mobility.I7 11-40 = PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT Criminal victimization often creates several psychoiogical problems for older persons. Among these problems are a devaluing of the self-image, intensification of social isolation. Fear itself stem- ming from criminal victimization, has important negative repercussions. ' Self-Concept The Connecticut Justice Commission, in a 1978 report on crimes against the elderly discussed the psychologi~al.conditions o~ olde! persons and how the self-image may be devalued b; the following factors statIstIcally or phYSIOlogIcally related to aging:I8 Series of losses; Reduction of income/purchasing power; Inadequate housing; Limited access to transportation; Problems with mobility; Poor nutrition; Breakdown of social network; Loss of spouse; Loss of peer relationships; Loss of meaningful roles; Decrease in vision, hearing, and muscular coordination; and Slowed reaction time. Being victimized by criminals serves to aggravate the already reduced self-concept an older person has. In the case of burglary, one of the most frequent crimes against the elderly, the victim loses ir\u00ad rep~aceable items of monetary and sentimental value as well as cash. Family heirlooms, gifts, and an~Ique~ cannot be valued at any dollar amount. Further, the impact of the sanctity of one's hom,,} bemg VIolated by a stranger can take a great psychological toll on the older victim. Fraud. involv~s m~ch more than a loss of money; the impact on an older victim's ego is often d~v~statmg. T~lS ~rIme often goes unreported because of embarrassment, fear; and the age of the VIctIm. Older VIctIms must contend with the speculations by others that they are becomi11g senile' t~e~ may fear losing their independent living status. For these reasons, they do not report being vic~ bmIzed by con art~s)js, a fact which makes them attractive targets for this type pf crime. Social Isolation The design of the criminal justice system requires a close examination of the role of the victim to determine his own ~egree of culpability. This in itself presents an additional pressure the victim r.nust endure after the CrIme has occurred. Beyond these pressures, however are the reactions of the com\u00ad munity to the victim's plight. American society attempts to under~tand human motivation and soc~al (and anti-~ocial) b~havior as rational parts of a fair and equitable world. According to tht~ SOCIal psychologISt Melvm J. Lerner, blaming the victim, (i.e., \"they brought it on themselves\") allows us to preserve our \"just world.,,19 11-41 , i , II ! I \\/ I j l II :~j n I tl !I II , 1 I) n .. J. L. Barkas, in her analysis of victimization and its consequences, described university experi\u00ad ments W'ftich measured people's reactions to hypothetical crime occurrences. The experiments showed that the less responsibility a victim had for a crime, the less sympathy he will receive from others.2o These reactions of the community intensify the social isolation felt by older victims, adding to the psychological traumas of victimization. Vicarious Victimization In an older, established community, news tends to travel fast through informal communication networks. When a neighbor is victimized, the crime problem is brought to a personal level, and in communities with many older residents this personification is pervasive. In addition, the media tend to sensationalize a crime against an older person because of its shock value and society's attraction to grisly reporting. Therefore, a rape or murder of an older person quickly may become a \"crime wave.\" As has been shown previously, older persons have good reasons to fear crime. This fear, however, can be generated for incidents that bear little relevancy to the' 'vicarious victim. \" The Montgomery County, Maryland study found that the majority of older persons felt the elderly were more likely to be victims of crime, regardless of the actuaI.,<:rime problem in their neighborhood or of personal victimization.21 Fear of Crime Older persons are usually more fearful of crime than their younger counterparts.22 This fear is caused by actual exposure to crime, vicarious vIctimization, and the location and type of neighborhood in which they live. This fear is not only brought about by actual victimization; older persons generally experience fear levels well above the actual crime level, regardless of personal victimization.23 -1 I The Connecticut Justice Commission report points out, through an analysis of national surveys, that victims of crime are only slightly more fearful of further attacks on their security than are non\u00ad victims. The most important determinant of fear is the perception of the crime problem by the individual.24 The Montgomery County study surveyed 178 persons aged 60 and over. They found that personal victimization had very little effect upon the levels of fear experienced by the individual. In that parti\u00ad cular jurisdiction, actual crime was considerably lower than the respondents perceived it to be.2s One of the primary influences upon perceptions of crime levels by citizens is their exposure to the crime of vandalism. This was the case in the Montgomery County study, and was also found to be true by the Maryland Commission on Law EIiforcement and the Administration of Justice. The Commission surveyed Maryland residents in 1976 and found that vandalism generates in the victim a great fear of crime in genera1.26 11-42 .. '0 t ! Another contributing factor to fear levels is the death of a spouse. The isolation and loss experi\u00ad en~ed by the older widow or widower contribute to a view of an increasingly di'fferent environment. It IS a human tendency to fear that which is strange. One's world may seem increasingly hostile as friends and loved ones are lost. This overall un\u00ad certainty about the world and people in general leads to a very specific fear of crime. 'Yhile t~e cau~e~ o~ such fear ~re significant, the effects an older person's lifestyle can be per\u00ad v.asl~~. Bemg victImized by a personal attack such as robbery, assault, or pursesnatching can slgmflcantly change an elderly person's lifestyle. The House of Representatives' Select Committee on Aging concluded that fear of victimization results in older persons locking themselves into their homes, too terrified to leave.27 The New York study of crime and the eld\u20ac!rly determined that:28 \"In most cases ~fter a criminal assault, the elderly feel they are deserted, unprotected, powerless and WIthout security. As sad as it may seem, in reality loneliness and despair are greatly aggravated if the television has been stolen.\" The stu~y continues with an excerpt from the New York Daily News: \"Visiting nurses, who daily travel to some of the worst sections of the city hear terrifying stories from their patients. Old people cower in the dark while someon~ batters dn the doors, then find one or two locks broken in the morning.\" The result of this increased fear of crime, regardless of the'source is further isolation virtual self-. , \" lmpnsonment, and a lower quality of life. SenatOI! Harrison A. Williams acknowledged this phenomenon in his widely quoted observation: 29 \"The sad fact is that millions of older American now live under a form of house arrest barricaded from the outside world. Many are afraid to answer a knock at the door.\" , Older persons may reduce essential trips outside the home due to a fear of crime. They may do less shopping, which in turn can lead to undernutrition and malnutrition. Older persons may also reduce t~eir social activities at a church, synagogue, community center, golden-age club, or the homes of fnends. Reduced social activity increases their isolation, and for many it causes depression and lessened self-care. Fear of crime can prevent some older persons from visiting theIr physician, dentist, podiatrist, health care center, and medical clinic. It may also cause some health care professional and social worker to become increasingly reluctant to visit the home of incapacitated inner-city older patients for fear of their own safety. Advancing age increases the prospects of isolation. Isolation heightens feelings of fear and paranoia which, in turn, are magnified by a crime situation. The conditions which lead to social isolation are common to the elderly. They tend to live apart and are concentrated in central cities.3o They suffer social isolation when crime or the fear of crime aggravates this life situation. Social isolation, coupled with fear, diminishes the quality of their lives and increases their vulnerability ! : I ; 1 ; crime. Carl Cunningham, in testimony before the Senate in 1973, described this situation in the following example:31 \"Two widowed women, aged 69 and 74, lived together. Their home was burglarized \"many timel) -five times in a single month. On one such occasion, the intruders entered while the occupants were at home. They mauled the two women when. they found only a crumpled dollar bill. The burglars' crime became easier when the victims eventually left their home at night due to fear. Their destruction caused $900 in property loss, a ran\u00ad sacked house virtually uninhabitable, and two demoralized residents, unlikely ever to regain peace of mind. The two widows must continue to live in that area because they have no place else to go.\" The Multnomah County, Oregon Study described the altered lifestyle of the fearful older American:32 \"Generally, it seemed that thbse persons who lived in most isolation and with little com\u00ad munity support, were those felt most alienated from their urban environment and the social service network. They were most withdrawn from contact with the social system in general. Many times there was a manifestation of lack of faith in system response and resilience. Such perceptions contributed to withdrawal from society but also would ac\u00ad count for stronger fear toward the society. There is, as well, some tendency for persons to withdraw more following a criminal incident with the intent of increasing their personal protection. As the isolation increases, fear increases which, in turn, promotes further isolation. \" Similarly, the Montgomery County study found that over one-half of the surveyed older persons said that fear of crime keeps them from doing the things they would like to do. Nearly two-thirds of actual victims surveyed now take protective measures, including not going out after dark.33 A recent National Crime Survey measured fear levels among the different age groups. The follow\u00ad ing charts indicate the degree that fear of crime affects older persons and their activities.34 Survey Personal Safety -Daytime Neighborhood Safety During The Day Age Very Reasonably Somewhat Very Safe Safe Unsafe Unsafe 16 to 19 58% 35% 5% 2% 20 Crime Su\\'vey Personal Safety -Nighttime Neighborhood Safety During The Night Age Very Reasonably Somewhat Very Safe Safe Unsafe Unsafe 16 to 19 21% 43% 20% 16% 20 I j k 1 , r I It 1 1 I National Crime Survey J !

':; \\ 0 ,~ .~< C) ~. D \\ 0\\', / It is more than apparent that fear of crime affects the lives of older p'~rsons. U is important for law enforcement officers to address this concern in the delivery of crime prevention awareness (lnd education programs. Without a realistic understanding of the problems to be dealt with and those that are exaggerated, law enforcement officers will lack the direction n.ecessary to provide positive change for elderly members of the community. Fear and hopelessness will inhibit active community involvement by older persons and individual protective measures may be targeted against crimes which are unlikely to occur. Further, other social program!!. outside of law enforcement cannot succeed until crime problems are sufficiently addressed. ' CONCLUSION Crime reports and victimization statistics do not reflect the added impact of crimes committed against older persons. The impact of monetary loss may create severe economic problems .. The physical injury inflicted by an attacker may cripple, if not kill, the older victim. Such injurles are often permanent. The psychological impact of crime and the fear of crime result in self-imprisoned living conditions and social isolation. For the elderly, these conditions produce hopelessness and frustration. ' SUMMARY When elderly persons are victimized by criminals, the impact upon them is much greater than society has been willing to recognize, I, First, the elderly victim suffers the trauma induced by the crimiR\\ll justice process itself. System personnel, for the most part, have not learned that the criminal justice process has negative conse\u00ad quences for an elderly victim and further increases his fear level. Second, the elderly victim who is living on a fixed income suffers economic losses far greater than those suffered by younger victims. Third, because of the physical deterioration brought about by the aging process, the elderly person is likely to suffer permanent physical harm as the result of a criminal attack. Finally, these prob\u00ad lems, in combination with the normal psychological changes common to the aging process, tend to produce a great sense of isolation and fear in the older victim, which can lead to further victimization. Iii ord~'tvo implement effective crime prevention awareness and education programs for the elderly, lay/enforcement officers must develop an understanding of why older persons in their com\u00ad munitie{ have such a fear of crime. Law enforcement officers must learn the consequences Of crime upon older persons in their com\u00ad munities and develop programs to help elderly victims cope with the criminal justice process and the aftermath of victimization. It should be a responsibility of law enforcement, in conjunction with social service agencies, to help elderly victims of crime survive the economic, phyisical, and psychological traumas brought about by criminal attacks.

LESSON FOUR CONFRONTING THE PItOBLEM There are many ways in which law enforcement agencies can reduce victimization and fear levels, assist victims, and enlist the aid of other institutions in the community. However, in order to ac\u00ad complish these goals, law enforcement a.gencies need to move from a traditional emphasis upon reactive policing to a new fQcus upon proactiVE policing. This proactive approach necessitates an awareness of the following points: Law enforcement must adequately identify the problem. Law enforcement must develop multi-faceted approaches to address the problem. Law enforcement cannot by itself alleviate the problem. Each of these points is equally important in the development of a proactive program to reduce victimization of the elderly and fear levels. There is logical sequencing to these points; if they are follqwed, then the law enforcement agency should be able to develop a leadership role in addressing community problems. This leadership role simultaneously will serve the interests of\u00b7the agency and its community, since this approach enables the police department to confront the crime problem by involving citizens as extra \"eyes and ears\" for officers. In addition, this approach provides a vehicle for the law enforcement agency to communicate with citizens and address other civil problems through cooperative police! community activities. Most importantly, this type of approach equips the department with the means to better fulfill its public service role. CRIME ANALYSIS Law enforcement agencies must have problems defined in clear reliable terms before they can develop strategies for a tactical or strategic response. Historically, the law enforcement response to community crime and service demand has been based on agency traditions or opinions'formed by personal experience. This technique was utilized by patrol officers as well as chief executive officers. However, recent trends to reduce funding for public service agencies have caused many police departments to reexamine their organizational service delivery approaches. Crime analysis is one method which is being used for planning purposes by police departments because this process provides data which supports all of the operations of a I:..:w enforcement agency. The 1977 Integrated Criminal Apprehension Program Crime Analysis Executive Manual presents this definition of crime analysis 1: c c. set of systematic, analytical processes directed at providing timely and pertinent in\u00ad formation relative to crime patterns ... \" 11-49 .. < , This definition relies on the pr()cesses. A complete description of crime analysis is determined by the level of analysis deployed; t~~ detail: of the analysis will establish its uses. J,1urposes 1) \"I) }\\ Crime analysis provides fpr: Data which has universal utility throughout the agency. Data which has been compared to other department data and reviewed for consistency. Data which may be collected, collated, stored, and disseminated with a centralization of staff effort. Data which can be placed in a format to provide the user with a clear understanding of its im\u00ad plications on agency operations. Crime analysis enables decision-makers to respond to community needs with the aid of data which accurately describes the problems. Uses How crime analysis data are used is limited only by the level of sophistication which the agency decides upon. This level may range from the pin maps of the early 1900s (and which are stilI widely used) to the computerized analyses and stochastic projections available to some police departments today. Although the products of crime analysis are limitless, some specific uses of the process are to: Develop crime pattern bulletins for patrol. The sp~6ifidty and timeliness of such bulletins are determined by the analysis methodology; but such information can be provided on daily basis. Identify special crime problems according to areas of interest. ~ Assist special task forces in determining program targets and ways to approach the problems. Increase the percentage of cases closed. A comparison check of offender patterns (MOs) may allow for more cases being attributed to apprehended offenders, thus increasing the number of cases closed by exception. Provide investigative leads to detectives. Identifiable evidence correlated with case numbers may allow for faster and more thorough searches ofJj[sf'cases and suspects. Assist crime prevention efforts by determining crime, victim, offender, a,rid location characteristics and thus the viability of particular crime prevention approaches. Be used to generate citizen support for such crime-specific programs. f I \" , ' \" \" / Measure and evaluate the results of crime-specific and over-all prevention efforts. Assist in-house decision-making processes that determine priorities and resource allocations, such as administrative and budgetary concerns. Assist with community crime prevention environmental decisions, such as housing, lighting, and related topics. Project future problem areas to be encountered. While all departments have always conducted crime analysis to some degr~e (wheth~r they realize it or not), two internal situations typically exi,st that prevent a comprehensive analysIs approach: 1. All data pertinent to a crime situation has not been coIlect~d, due to the varying degrees of im- portance the department places in the reporting process. ' 2. What data is extracted from the crime situation is not systematically collected ~nd stored for efficient retrieval. Generally, reports are stored, either physically or electromcally, by case number. This requires an exhaustive manual search of files in the case of phY~ical,. storage. With electronic storage, computers often are not adequately programmed to delIver mforma\u00ad tion beyond crime type and case number. Report Form Some jurisdictions have no flexibility in modifying report forms because, of le~islated re\u00ad quirements or expensive data processing systems which s.tore records. For agencIes WhIch do have the flexibility to ~})dify reporting formats, several reporting form procedures are recommended. ( Crime analysis depends primarily on the offense report for raw data. ~f the offense report is in\u00ad adequate or if it is completed inaccurately, the crime analysis efforts are severely crippled. Questions which should be asked to determine if a report form meets crime analysis needs include: Is the descriptive data complete? Is data organized so that significant data elements are listed at the same place on the offense report for ease of data extraction? Is there space available for a description of the suspect's method of operation? Revising an offense repo,rt form is a complex and lengthy process for, most agencies. In addition, it usually is an emotional issue for the primary user-the patrol offIcer. Report form changes, therefore, should not be made without cause. II \\1 k d .. If however the law enforcement agency wants to obtain the data necessary to ma e eCISIons <'abo~J service delivery, then it must review the offens~ report form to insure that adequate data is be\u00ad ing captured for a crime analysis. II-51 ! ( But creating an adequate report form is only the/irst step. Patrol officers who win be using the form must be trained to fill it out properly. Supervisors and report review personnel also must be trained so that they can properly review the work of the officers. As the data collection instrument for crime analysis, the report form also is the principal source (If information for every decision-maker in the agency. Therefore, it is a document which should serve all members of the department and provide the best data collection service possible. Data Collection The process of categorizing the data from the report form is extremely important. It must be ~stematic to account for all incidents from all areas of interest, and should be timely to allow for the most effective use of the data by the department. Crime analysis data are used over a period of time to establish patterns, but they also can be used immediately to augment routine patrol in\u00ad vestigative functions. The data should be categorized as specifically as possible, including a breakdown of crime types. The age categories selected should coincide with available census data for the jurisdiction to allow for comparison with this existing data. For example, if census data defines older persons as 65 and over, then the department must follow that definition if it is to draw on this source of information. Victim Survey There is a great deal of information pertinent to a crime situation that cannot be collected from an incidtmt report form submitted by the responding officer. Due to time constraints and the condition of the victim, it is often not appropriate for the responding officer to ask detailed questions about the crime to help determine why it occurred. Similarly, it is often inappropriate for the responding officer to ask the victim about his previous history of victimization and whether or not he may have contributed to the criminal act through negligence, provocation, or other acts. Information about the factors leading up to the crime is essential for developing effective countermeasures. For example, the previously mentioned Wilmington, Delaware project::~astrates the necessity for complete information. The initial propof'al to combat street crime ill Wilmington involved increasing street lighting at night. However, a ten-question survey of victims revealed that the overwhelming majority of personal attacks were occurring during daylight hours (see Appendix A for the actual survey).2 Thus, expensive and ineffective countermeasures to a crime problem. were avoided, and valuable information leading to practical solutions was obtained. A victimization survey neF.:d not be limited to identified victinis only. The Akron, Ohio Police Department, for example, has developed a questionnaire it regularly distributes to its older popula\u00ad tion. (See Appendix A for the actual survey). Section One of this survey form contains questions for all respondents, and Section Two contains detailed questions for crime victims only. Regardless of the approach used, a local victimization survey will capture valuable information about the crime problems within the jurisdiction. In addition, it will clearly demonstrate that a con\u00ad cerned law enforcement agency is taking an affirmative community leadership role. II-52 ff An offender survey will generate detailed information about a crime situation from the offender's point of view. This type of sm'vey goes directly to the source in determining causal factors. For ex\u00ad ample, the Wilmington Police obtained valuable information from youthful offenders by conduct\u00ad ing an offender survey. This information was extremely useful for tailoring police activities to specific crime targets. It can also be very helpful to the police officer who has been assigned to pres\u00ad ent information to community groups.3 There are\" of course, important factors which must be considered when using this type of infor\u00ad mation. The motivation and veracity of the offender must be taken into account. Consistent response tendencies usually will indicate usable information. As with victimization surveys, the in\u00ad formation culled from offender surveys may go well beyond what can be determined from incident reports. Data Collection and Collation Crime analysis data are collected from the three sources previously mentioned: 1. The incident reports; 2. The victim surveys; and 3. The offender surveys. Each source must be consistent with the others in the various categories pertaining to the crime, the victim, and the offender. For example, the category in all three data gathering instruments for \"older persons\" must include people aged 65 and over if 65 is the age used to delineate \"older per\u00ad sons.\" Further, these categories must be consistent with outside sources, such as census data. Once they have been collected, data are then arranged in an organized format so that compalison among sources is quick and efficient. This organizational format permits retrieval by any number of criteria, such as crime type location, residential area blocks, and so forth. Data Analysis Data analysis is the systematic combination of the information collected into relevant patterns, trends, and relationships. Some of the variables included in this process are: Victim characteristics; Offender characteristics; Location of vict.im's residence in relation to crime scene; Location of offender's residence in relation to crime scene; Victim's activities before crime; Offender's activities before crime; crime; Tim.~ of occurrence; Location of crime scene; ~ Modus operandi;. Losses suffered by victim; and Other extenuating circumstances. II-53 ill. Jj ;) il q lj ; 1\\ , i I II } i II 1\\ I! I I: !l Through this process, detailed \u00b7victim and offender profiles can be developed, and high-risk times, places, and occasions can be identified. While computer capabilities will greatly aid this process, the use of a compute~ is by no means mandatory. As an example, the Wilmington crime analysis study was conducted wIthout the use of computer (see Appendix B for Profile). .. . When computer facilities are available, there are a number of software program~ng packages such as SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) available for use t V t~e la!?Ian. I~ood sources of information about programming packages are the local colleges and umverSItIe~, wl,~Ich also may have facilities available to process data. Computer capabilities will permit the police dl,rpartment to conduct a very detailed analysis of the data. Incident Analysis This process involves inspecting the actual incident report to determine which activities may be contributing to the occurrence of a particular type of crime, such as ag~ravated assault. Due t.o the specificity of the information obtained, prevention measures can be deSIgned to deter these CrImes. The need for such detailed analyses becomes apparent with cases of escalating crimes. Many times serious crimes grow out of lesser offenses, due to opportunity. An aggr~v~tedassault, for example, may have grown from an initial breaking and e~teri?g; however, the v!ctIm was home and the .of\u00ad fender assaulted him. An incident analysis of thIS CrIme would tell polIce planners that preventIon techniques should be directed at the initial burglary rather than the subsequent a.ggravated assault. In a case such as this, controlling the crime of burglary will also control the CrIme of aggravated assault. Conducting a detailed incident analysis is costly in terms of the personnel time required; however, the department can derive two major benefits from this time investment: 1. An incident analysis can eliminate the need for costly counterme~sures to co~bat escdalatin dg crime problems; the incident analysis helps define proper cnme preventIon nee s an techniques. 2. Through proper crime prevention techniques, an incident analysis can help officers effectively control initial crimes of a less serious nature. Victimization Analysis This is a process by which the overall impact of crimes affecting ~ particular cOI?mu?it! is ?eter\u00ad mined. The purpose of this process is to find out what types of cnmes are affectmg VIctIms In the following categories: Daily routine and activities; Feelings of fear; Financial situation; Health status; Security and ,. , , 1 I .-\\ , -- / This process should also help police determine how often citizens do not report crimes, and the reasons why they fail to report. A victimization analysis will also provide police with information about the precautionary measures former victims are taking as a result of their previous experiences with crime. Dissemination nnd Evaluation The results of the findings derived from'the crime analysis processes must be carefully directed to the appropriate area of the department, be it patrol, planning, crime prevention, etc. The rapid:ity with which the information is disseminated will dictate the uses it may have-the more uses iden\u00ad tified, the greater the value of the crime analysis process. The crime analysis process also can be us,ed to monitor and evaluate departmental activities. This evaluation should include the crime analysis process itself. If the process is not fulfilling its planned roles, then someone must determine why this is happening. Crime Analysis: Conclusions In order to marshal resources to respond to community needs, law enforcement personnel at all levels must be armed with a clear understanding of the problems. Community needs are complex and the solutions are even more difficult to comprehend. It is only through the application of sound data collection and planning principles that law enforcement can hope to meet the challenge. The techniques and expertise have been developed; it is .'Up to each individual police agency to use them. Approaching the decision-making process arm<:d with accurate data will enhance a law enforement agency's effectiveness in the community it ser\\.'es. CRIME PREVENTION Crime prevention can be defined as the \"anticipation, recognition, and appraisal of a crime risk and the initiation of action to reduce or remove this risk.' '4 This is another example of proactive policing: attack the problem before it becomes one. The cornerstone of a crime prevention program is community awareness. Citizens are made to realize that they must take action, with the assistance of the police, to reduce their likelihood of be\u00ad ing victimized. As Lesson Two established, the overall crime problems for older persons consist of: Strong-arm robbery; Pursesnatching and pickpocketing; Fraud/bunco; Burglary; and Vandalism. crime categories represent nationwide tendencies -they do not typify anyone particular jurisdiction. Local crime analysis is necessary in order to accurately determine local crime problems. While the application of crime prevention techniques is an easy and effective way to reduce crime, each individual technique must be directed in its approach.

Upon receiving such training, law enforcement officers should be prepared to initiate preventive action in the community, an~ should be able to identify and use other community resources to help accomplish this. A leadership role should be taken by the police department. COMMUNITY RESOURCES In addition to establishing working relationships with the community's older population, the law enforcement agency must develop joint programming efforts with other institutions in the comM munity. This means actively seeking the cooperation of such organizations as: Other law enforcement agencies: A regional network of law enforcement agency interaction will expand the population base affected by programs, and facilitate the dissemination of inforM mati on throughout a jurisdiction and its fmrrounding areas. Social service age~cies: Such agencies can deal with specific problems encountered by law enM forcement on a referral basis, and strengthen ties between law enforcement and existing comM munity groups. Area agencies on aging: The coordination of law enforcement programs with other efforts targeted at the problems and needs of older persons builds a comprehensive framework for dealing with issues. This is notably lacking in current approaches. Other governmental agencies: Interaction with the many resources provided by government agencies avoids duplication of efforts and a shotgun approach. Community groups: The informal power structure in virtually any jurisdiction lies in its com\u00ad munity groups. The success of a law enforcement program will rely heavily on its acceptance by such groups. Traditionally, they are the building blocks of social programs. Banks and savings and loan associations: These institutions generally have tremendous inM fluence over the flow of resources, financial and otherwise, in a community. Second, they are often the last line of defense against fraud and bunco schemes, and in the past have demonstrated an ability and desire to significantly curtail these schemes, Local chamber of commerce: The strong link between community resources and social net\u00ad works often is the local chamber of commerce. This body can provide much of the cooperation required for a successful program. Schools: The children of a community are not only a frequent target audience for law enforceM ment programs, but can serve as effective vehicles for reaching the parents.

The importance of studying the ramifications of legislative action is easily seen with~lthe cririnal justice system today. Cohesive community involvement has effectively addressed suc aw en orce- ment concerns as: Reducing \"revolving door\" justice; Reinstating into the correctional system the idea of punishment as a deterrence to crime; Securing stricter penalties for white collar crimes, including fraud and bunco; and II-58 f I '\\ I~creasing victim compensatio:1 measures. Changes in each of these areas are affecting the crime problem. A proactive approa.~h to crime by law enforcement and its supporters will continue to improve the quality of life within our com\u00ad munities. CONCLUSION The expansion of traditional law enforcement procedure1: to involve community:..oriented and citizen participation programs has integrated the role of the police more closely with the formal and informal operational structures of communities. Equally important, such expansion has provided a vehicle for citizen participation and self-help in addressing the crime prevention needs of the com\u00ad munity. The actions which law enforcement agencies have been taking to address the needs of older O'~r\u00ad sons are based upon an actual awareness of the crime problems the elderly face and the impact of those crimes. A clear perspective of the problems, brought about by the many forms of crime analysis, enables a police department to develop effective cO)J:tt:1termeasures. The success of these countermeasures relies upon the department's ability to remove the criminal opportunity (crime prevention), and the degree of community il),volvement. This combination is a proven technique for significantly reducing crime. SUMMARY To effectively reduce criminal victimization of the elderly. law enforcement agencies must ac\u00ad curately identify the problems in their own communities. Problem identification is accomplished through crime analysis efforts. An effect:}~H~~.(rne analysis program enables a law enforcement agency to direct resources to respond to commtinh~ needs. By utilizing crime analysis, the law enforcement agency is able to become proactive, rather than reac\u00ad tive, in its efforts to prevent and control victimization of the elderly. To prevent criminal victimization of the elderly. police must take a leadership role in the crime prevention efforts of their communities. The law enforcement agency has a definite role as a manager of community resources. As the agency responsible for community crime control, the police department must marshal other com\u00ad munity resources in its crime prevention efforts. Community agencies will be able to help the police department communicate with older citizens and teach them how to avoid Assistance Administration, Integrated Criminal Apprehension priJgram Crime 1.

There is good profit at $10 each due to the small overhead. MIRACLE CURES: there is always someone who claims a cure for any condition. Often, these are publicized through newspapers or magazines and the quackery is consummated by the use of the mails. MAlI,. ORDER CLINIC: the victim is drawn into the scheme by offers of free medical diagnosis or some, other bait and then is trapped into expensive long-term and useless treatments. THE FAKE CONTEST: it often starts with the exciting statement that you have won. In reality, it is a contest wherein no one wins-there are only losers. This can be practiced by mail or adver\u00ad tisements or by telephone solicitations. HOME IMPROVEMENTS: this swindle places high on the list and has long been among th~ most popular. Often the US Postal Service is brought into the case because the mails are used to defraud. CHAIN REFERRAL SCHEMES: where you buy an appliance or some product and supposedly will have little difficulty getting the item for \"free\" since you will get a commission for each addi\u00ad tional item you sell. Usually the item is overpriced. DEBT CONSOLIDATION: involves dishonest services that place the debt-ridden person into a worse situation by \"consoli~atin~\" his debts with heavy additional financial burdens. \\\\\"', )) THE BANK EXAMINER: prhicipal targets are people in the 60 and over age group. A phony bank or savings and loan \"investigator\" calls you at home or comes to your home. He has probably brought along deposit slips from your bank and other official looking papers. He tells you that the bank is checking up on a dishonest employee, and explains how you can help. He says he wants to make a test \"to see what the suspected emloyee does when a customer draws out of ,his account. He suggests that you go to your bank, draw a specified amount of money, then let him use it for the test. Either he or a \"bonded messenger\" or other \"official\" will pick up the money. You withdraw the money. He has advised you of the need for\" absolute secrecy\" and that the money must be cash in order to check serial numbers. You give the money to the \"examiner\" and he hands you a receipt. Once he is gone, you'll never see ,him or your money again. RETIREMENT ESTATES: where the bargain looks so attractive you cannot turn it down. An acre of land for $350 and sunshine for 360 days per year. Investigation reveals that if you go to the area there is no provision for development and the site i~ under water or unsuitable for building. 11-77 , o i i .. I; EMPLOYMENT OFFERS: where persons, eager to achieve self-improvement, are drawn into contracts requiring payments for useless services purportedly leading to attractive job opportunities. CORRESPONDENCE COURSES: the fraudulent correspondence school usually induce the vic\u00ad tim to sign contracts which trap them into regular payments from which they cannot legally escape. ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN: where you are chosen to be featured in an advertising campaign. You may be told that a survey has shown that you are a \"leader\" or that you are unique in some way and this feature will be used to build an advertising campaign. You will be given benefits or some in\u00ad ducement to participate. Be aware that the legal document you may sign does not bind you tQ make payments or lose your home. BAIT AND SWITCH: is advertising a commodity at a low price, even at cost or 'below, with the idea that you will be attracted to the store and buy something else or get into the habit of shopping there. This describes the legitimate merchant. The illegal \"come-ons\" are ridiculously-priced mer\u00ad chandise that does not exist, or wili-not be sold, and the only intention was to get you into the store to steer you to an unknown brand at a high price. CONTRACTS: signing a contract that contains terms that go far beyond what you anticipated is one of the integral parts of so many swindles today. KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SIGNING. FEAR-SELL: is a technique to rush a'victim into the arms of a swindler, i.e., ... Your hot water heater is .about to blow up and must be replaced immediately. The electrical wiring is so bad that unless something is done about it right away your home will probably burn down. If this part of your car is not replaced now you are likely to have to buy a new engine. THE INSPECTOR: someone posing as an official inspector displays phony credentials and says he is making a routine inspection to gain entry into your home. The hot water heater is inspected and declared unsafe. You will have to turn off the water until something is done about this p6tential disaster. The insector happens to know a plumber, who resI=.:>nds and does little or no work, charges an exorbitant amou,nt, and may even sign up the homeowner to a fat maintenance contract. Strategies to reduce fraud incidence and impact include law enforcement agepcy cooperation with community institutions and the judicial system, as well as with the fraud/bunco squads of other jurisdictions. Another strategy is education, bot.h for elderly persons and the police. The elderly should be taught measures for spotting fraud and for initiating action once it is in process. Police should expand their knowledge of fraud. THE PIGEON DROP: the victim is approached by one of the swindlers and engaged in conversa\u00ad tion. When the swindler has gained the victim's confiden,r,;(;~.>she mentions a large sum of money found by a second swindler who, at that moment, \"happc~(s\" \\0 pass by. The victim is led to beUeve that whoever lost the money probably came by it unlawfu'-,.~h:~The swindlers discuss with the Victim what to do with the money. One of the swindlers says that ~\"~e works in ~}1..e vicinity, and decides to contact her \"employer\" for advice. She returns in a fev/ minutes and states that her boss has counted the money and verified the amount, and thait he ~!~rees that as the money undoubtedly was stolen, they should keep and divide the money three wa~~, but that each should show evidence of financial responsibility and \"good faith\" before collecting a share.

They are trained to use a variety of \"tools\" to re- ., spond to the many calls for assistance they receife. Among the more visible \"tools\" a.re physical prowess, handcuffs, batons, firearms, radio~)/~ p~trol cars. Interestingly, however, most ponce problems are solved without resorting to the \"hea\\~y\",artilIery\" tools. Rather, the officer is likely to talk-to communicate-his way out of a problem or\"'i~to p:?>lution~ , '.~ Officers do not immediately recognize that words are a practical police \"tool\" because the act of communicating is so commonplace it is often taken for granted. About 70 to 80 percent of an of\u00ad ficer's on-duty time is spent talking, listening, reading, or writing. Because the officer spends so much time communicating, his ability to skillfully usec;.words and non-verbal \"signals\" probably is the most significant determinant of his professional effectiveness. /-' \" \" Communicating effectively is indeed a skill and, like other skills, it must be learned. Most people learn by doing. By the time a young person enrolls in a law enforcerr ~nt academy, his com\u00ad IlLunicative habits\u00b7 and patterns are well established. Thus, he seldom takes time to examine the elements of the cCimmunication process and he may never identify methods which he can use to im\u00ad prove hiscomfu~}nicative abilities. An officer who works to improve his ability to communicate ef\u00ad fectively eventually learns that he can solve many more problems without resorting to' threats or the use of physical force. ,\\'., o Communicating with older persons is not very different from communicating with others in the sense that all corftmunication has common elements. It is different, however, in two respects: the . methods in which the common elements of communication are emphasized and articulated. Because the aging process may cause changes in the older person's physiology, sensory perception, psychological well-being, and frame of reference, law enforcement officers should recognize that they may need to use different c~mmunication techniques when \\fuey are assisting an older person. . , \" \\\\ ~ ~ The l~\u00a7son emphasi:z;es the elements of the communication proce~s which are particularly impor- tant in working with the elderly. . COMMUNICATION IS. PURPOSEFUL AU communication has a purpose. It ranges' i~om the mundane, such. as cocktail party chatter to pass the time, to the vital-obtaining information about a life-threatening crime. In most official contacts~ the law enforcement officer wants to maintain a reasonable level of control over the flow of information. He:: is usually respbnding to a request for service which must be sandwiched between other reqweS~S0~ of higher priority;-For the officer, being \"ontop\" of the communication is im- portant. \\, .~ \" ' III~l Y! I , ;' ~. ..) Purpose Influenced By Role The purpose or objective of a conversation between an officer and an older person will vary ac\u00ad cording to the role of each. The officer must be acutely aware of his role and objectives. For exam\u00ad ple, the patrol officer who responds to a call for assistance from an older person must assess the situation to determine what is needed from that encounter. If the older person is the victim of a crime, the officer obviously needs specific information about the incident, any valuables lost, any injuries sustained, and possible suspect descrimions. Additionally, the officer needs to provide reassurance to the older person, who may ,t~lighly agitated, emotionally upset, suffering from shock, or require medical attention. Second, the patrol officer needs to leave the older person with a positive attitude about the en\u00ad counter. This is important because the follow-up investigator will have to deal with any dissatisfac\u00ad tion which results from the first contact. It is also important becal'.se the older person's attitude toward-and ultimately support for-the police will be strongly affected by the extent of satisfac\u00ad tion he receives from the original service encounter. 1 The follow-up inve~tigator also needs to obtain specific and accurate information from an older crime victim. Unlike the patrol officer, however, the investigator must go one step further: he needs to assess the victim's potential as (:t witness who will be able to identify suspected perpetrators and provide believable testimony in court. Yet a third role in which a patrol officer might find himself is that of crime prevention program\u00ad mer. In this role, the communication needs and processes are significantly different. The objectives usually are to inform, to enlighten, and hopefully to modify the behavio. r of citizens so that they can ~ assist in protecting themselves and their property. 1\\ Just as the officer must be aware of his own actions and attitudes, he must also be sensitive to the older person's abilities, restrictions, and point of view. Recognition of these factors is the first step toward effective communication. The ability to recognize and appreciate the other person's view\u00ad point is called empathy, communication awareness, or psychological adaptation. \"Walking a mile in the other person's moccasins\" is a more down-to-earth description of the same phenomenon. Whatever name applies, the ability to empathize usually results from a person's curiosity about human behavior and from a genuine interest in other people. It contributes significantly to one's ability to aim a message at the right target. If the officer has an inaccurate perception of the older pers<;m's needs, then his messages to the older person will most likely be inaccurate, resulting in wasted time, mutual discomfort, and ultimate dissatisfaction. Purpose Implies Planning If all communication is purposeful, then logic dictates that it should be planned, at least if the communicator wants to be as effective as possible. Many police officers confuse efficient comI1i'unication with effective communication. Efficiency is an input to output measure. It tells how mu(!h energy must be used to get an established unit of production. For example, if an automobile gets 35 miles to a gallon of gas, the manufacturer then 111-2 . l' ! . , \" .- ... ', (J , . \", / claims that the engine is efficient. The basic purpose of an efficiency measure is to find the most economical, or cheapest, way Of doing something. Effectiveness, on the other hand, measures the extent to which any effort or activity accomplishes its goals. An effectiveness measUre does not focus on economy alone; it also considers the qualitat,lve aspects desired. For example, with the car that has an efficient engine, prospective purchasers will ask several qualitative questions, such as: Is the rid~ ill the car comfortable? Can seven people be accommodated? How much luggage room is there? This exampl(idemormtrates that the most efficient approach to an undertaking may not be the most effectiv~.i:Tha.~ is paflticularly true of the. commu~ication act is measured by ItS~l2Pld rate/pnly, then the total Impact of the commUnIcatIon IS not lIkely to be effec\u00ad tive. An commu'i1ication process would be considered successful if the pel:son who receives the message is satisfied with both its content (substance) and the way it was\u00ab;~!Uvered (form). \\,/ Planning, as it applies to communication, does not need to ,'pe complicated. Most people think about particularly important conversations they are going to haye, such as employment interviews. They also plan what they are going to write in letters when the\u00b7 subject matter is very important to them, such as a letter requesting a loan. Therefore, it is reasonallle to 'suggest that such forethought should also be given to contacts with persons who are seeking help from\"''the police, especially if they are elderly people who may be .very vulnerable and afraid to ask for help. Planning a communicative act depends Oil a variety of factors. One of the most important is the \"stakes\" involved. Every communicative situation in law enforcement is different, despite the natural tendency to homogenize them for ease of classification and response. The officer must ask himself what the \"pay-off\" is for putting time and energy into planning something as commonplace as commuaicating. Pay-offs vary according to individual needs and perceptions. For one officer, planning a field contact may be seen as making the job easier. For another, it will help him be more in control of the situation. For a third, it might just help resolve the problem in a more timeiy fashion so that he can move on to other pressing matters. For them all, it might result in a sense of satisfaction in doing a thorough job and helping someone in the process. Whatever ,the pay-offs are, officers must be aware of them. They affect behavior even if they are not consciously recognized. When the officer recognizes what he could gain from a particular com\u00ad municative experience, then he is much closer to gaining it. If an officer knows what the pay-offs are, then he can develop a plan to attain them. Achieving this goal requires a reasonable knowledge of the elements of communication and the techniques available for influencing those elements. OVERVIEW OF THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS Law enforcement officers are practitioners who must view academic th~ories guardedly. Theories can be extremely practical, however, if they are seen as road maps to help officers reach their desired goals. Understanding communication is made easier by constructing a theoretical model, a road map, that identifies the elements of the process. 111-3 j) , __ FEEDBACK Interpret Non-Verbal , One useful model views communication as taking place within an aren~ in which people use words as symbols for the ideas they wish to transmit. In simplified form, the Ideas ar~ sent through tw~ channels One channel is verbal; ideas are put into a language code, or words. 1 he se~ond channe transmit~ non-verbal behavioral clues, which show the true me&ning of the words. OffIcers WI~ are experienced at interviewing people are skilled at \"reading\" non-verbal clues-they seem to now when a person is lying to them. The arena in which the communication takes place indudes the im~ediate p~ysi~al area. It ~lso includes the space around the communicatOI's. The use of that space IS a factor 10 tne commumca- tion equation. The critical elements of this model are people (the communicators), the verbal and non-ve~~al transmission channels, and the arena itself. Each of these must be examined closely to understan ItS impact on overall communicative effectiveness. '. .~ / -~----~~~---People: The Communicators People communicate what they feel; psychologically, people communicate what they are. Put simply, this means that a person's personal background, cultural experiences, and value system in\u00ad fluence what he says and what he hears. Self-awarenes~ is a fundamental component of effective communication. This is particularly true in a law enforcement contact, since the officer plays the role of problem-solver-he is responsible for making the communication work. The process which a person uses to become aware of his own feelings and attitudes is similar to other problem-solving processes. For example, when a persan first tries to dive for an object on the bottom of a swimming pool, he quickly learns that there is a trick to this process. Diving directly for the object will result in missing it. The wat:r bends light rays, mak\u00ad ing the object on the bottom appear to be in one place, when it is actually some distance away. If the diver knows this in advance, he can adjust the dive and hit the target on the first attempt. If not, a rapid <:~adjustment must be made after the dive. Meanwhile, the diver has used up valuable energy and air going to the wrong spot. A person's background experiences and valu,e systems affect what he sees much as the water bends light rays; each person interprets events in light of his own unique background. What a per\u00ad son sees is partly what he wants to see-he \"bends\" reality a bit. Thus, the more a person knows about himself and his tendency to interpret, or bend, the facts, the more likely he is to compensate and \"hit the target\" on his first try. If an officer devel<?ps an understanding of how his own built\u00ad in biases and attitudes affect the way he interprets things, he has taken the first step toward com\u00ad municating more effectively. Lenses o~ Bias Affect Communication Reality Them ) \\ \\ Reality \\ -I t / ,I Us Reality , .. Much has been written about the value systems of law enforcement officers. ij;z:search conclusions are unimportant here except to reinforce the need to recognize the common ~t{read of cynicism and suspicion that seems to be woven into the fabric of the police experience. B~ing sli:5iJi~ious is a car\u00ad dinal rule of good police work. Carried to extremeS, however, it becomes fa hindrance. More important than supposed profession-wide biases ate the officer,\u00b7g personal feelings about, and attitudes tow(trd, older Americans. Each officer must cl6Sc1y examine his own feelings. What experiences has he had with older people? When were those experiences? Were the older people relatives, friends, or unknown faces in the neighborhood? Did the. cultural system in which the of- ficer grew up place a high value on age? The answers to these questions, and many others, will give the officer some indication of the source of his attitudes toward older persons. Understanding how these attitudes influence his cur\u00ad rent perceptions and behavioral patterns requires further self:~analysis. The extent to which t:he offi(';er wants to spend time and energy in self-examination depends to some degree on the pay-off. What is the return on such an investment? Once again, the answer will vary with the individual. The simplest answer might be to ensure greater control over other people. The more the officer knows about himself, the less susceptible he is to manipulation by others. It is particularly important for an officer to be a.ware of his \"hot spots.\" Simply defined, \"hot spots\" are ideas, words, or behaviors which provoke an emotional reaction from the officer before he has a chance to think about it. \"Hot spots\"V'ary from person to person. For example, one of\u00ad ficer might react negatively to crying, believing it is used as a manipulative ploy. Another officer might react to certain words which suggest to him an ethnic slur. Still another might react to a par\u00ad ticular accent. Women officers sometimes react to what they consider to be \"patronizing\" or \"de- meaning\" words when these words are used by men. It is relatively easy for an accomplished communicator to discover a person's \"hot spots.\" It is a little like prospecting for gold. Scratch around with a few test \"digs,\" find out what words or behaviors produce the desired emotional response, and then go for the mother lode. The result will be to draw the unsuspecting party away from the intended topic. Just as a person's experiences filter how he perceives the external world, they also affect how that person tells the world things about himself. The manner in which a person interprets things may be called receiver behavior. How the same person expresses thoughts, feelings, and ideas constitutes sender behavior. Each individual in a communication network is both a sender and a receiver of data. The sending process is an external behavior and is observable. The receiving and interpreting process is internal and is not readily observable. Figure Two illustrates how biases affect the flow of information from both directions. It is critical to recognize that the communication awareness process is bidirectional. Just knowing oneself is only part of the battle; one must also be sensitive to the attitudes and perceptions of the other party in the communicative relationship. This is especially important for police officers to realize since people have a tendency to project their own value judgments onto others.

' a spen \\1 II )I Ii \\1 . \" . The Verbal Transmission Channel In our culture, communication relies heavily on words, whether they are spoken or written. Despite this reliance, it is amazing how easily people can misuse words and confuse others (and perhaps themselves). A good example of a person who confuses others by using the wrong words is television'S Archie Bun\u00b7ker. One of the most common word-related errors is labeled the \"container myth\" by semanticists (people who study the meaning of words). This myth holds that words have meanings. In fact, words themselves do not have meanings; rather, people have meanings which they apply to words they hear. For example, the word \"run\" has more than 170 meanings in the Random House Unabridged Dictionary. It is critically important that officers occasionally test whether the words they are using are being heard with the intended meaning. Closely relat~d'to the \"container myth\" is an over-emphasis on jargon. This is especially true of work-related jargon, such as that used by police officers. Officers routinely talk in terms of codes, numbers, and acronyms: ten codes, penal codes, geographic codes, car numbers, beat numbers, of\u00ad ficer numbers, MOs, NCIC, and OWl. People become \"subjects\" and getting out of a car becomes \"exiting the vehicle.\" Running across the street becomes \"proceeding laterally through the boulevCtfd intersection.\" What is obviously shorthand or witness stand precision to the officer becomes gobbledygook to the average citizen. It is also possible to use the improper word level, or to talk \"above someone's head.\" Sinc<? the officer is responsible for solvinz the problem in an official contact, he must take care to match the words used to the listener's knowledge level. A related problem is circumlocution, or using words that are so ambiguous or imprecise that they do not focus on the subject. The talker \"walks around\" the subject, hopefully getting closer and closer until the listener grasps the intended meaning. The Verbal Reception Channel: Feedback The same problems that can interfere while a message is being trnnst~litted can ~lso damage its reception. The person requesting police assistance can be as imprecise or unclear-as any officer. It is still the responsi.bility of the officer, however, to stay on top of the situation and to interpret correct\u00ad ly the verbal information he receives. It is only through feedback that the communicator can deter\u00ad mine whether his message is getting through as desired. Active listening is perhaps the most difficult challenge in communication. Despite the fact that people listen more than they talk, listening remains the least developed skill in most people. People talk at approximately 125 to 150 words per minute. However, the mind is capable of processing and understanding 300 to 700 words per minute. In addition, it is a known fact that, under normal cir\u00ad cumstances, a speaker only can hold a listener's undivided attenti~n for 15 to 45 seconds before the listener's mind begins to wander. Thus, people who appear to be listening are often thinking about other things. Ii ,/ ':'.1' ; . -. There are some techniques which an officer can learn to put people at ease so that they pay more careful f,Jtention to what he has to say. One of these techniques is to use small talk. The importance of sma\u00a5( talk will become evident quickly when working with older persons. Smal! talk is a reliable technique for making the older person comfortable and establishing rapport. Small talk can prevent relationships from becoming strained or marked by mistrust. Small talk is often a ten-to-fifteen minute conversation in which the officer sincerely asks something about the older person's personal life. It is often easy to develop a question to ask by looking at objects or people in the older person's surroundings; for example, a photograph, a flower garden, or a piece of antique furniture is a suitable conversation item. The older person must be a!lowed suffi~ient time t.o respond, or the officer's sincerity will be doubted. While listening, the of\u00ad fIcer can begm to orgamze hIS plan for taKing control of the conversation and turning it toward the business at hand. The more an officer lets people talk, the more they will like him and respond to him. This tends to be true of everyone, and older persons are not exceptions. It is usually best for the officer to allow the subject of the interview to start the conversation. However, the officer needs to control and guide the conversation toward the objective at hand.:: For many older persons, long term memory is better than short term memory. Thus, officers should expect older people to recall details periodically during the interview as well as for some time after it. An officer who wants to conduct an effective interview should not rush older persons nor should he rush immediate reconstruction of a traumatic event if it can be avoided. The officer should attempt to desensitiz~ the older victim or witness by reassuriflg'and calming him. With older persons, rage, fear, frustration, and shock can lead to serious consequences, such as a heart attack. .. As the interview or interrogation proceeds, the officer should pay careful attention to the feed\u00ad back from the older person. Feedback indicates how \"close to the mark\" communicative efforts are coming. Avoiding closed questions-those that can be answered by a yes or no or a nod of the head-will help keep vital feedback cues flowing. Open-ended questions will also provide the older person with an opportunity to provide a better information base for the interviewer, a role that can generate significant ego satisfaction for the elderly. Officers also find it effective to build questions out of the older person's last response. In this way, the interviewer is able to verify the accuracy of his own understanding while moving the con\u00ad y~rsation forward. A related technique is to select topic statements out of the main points in the dialogue. If the officer repe~lts such statements back to the older person in a varied question and answer format, then he can check for consistency. The officer should not hellitate to ask for ,clarification of a statement or to challenge the answer in a direct, but tactful, fashion. Controlling The Verbal Channe!s: Some Techniques It is important to control intervi~ws or interrogations by mastering cl.~mmunication skills rather than relying on the \"weight of authority\" which the uniform and badge provide. An officer who relies on such authority symbols and demands answers simply because he is a police officer may pro\u00ad voke defensive behavior on the part of the interviewee. Once an officer builds these barriers it becomes very difficult for him to communicate effectively with the person he is trying to intervi~w. ' 'I' ;, A crucial element of control is\\ understanding the role of the interviewer. When an interviewer makes a subjective, personal, emotional, or value judgment of the other person, he is reacti~g .to that individual. Conversely, when the interViewer attempts to understand the other person, he IS m\u00ad teracting. If the interviewer's objective is to obtain factual, relatively unbiased information, then in\u00ad teractive behavior is more beneficial than reactive behavior. Reactive behavior flows almost naturally because most people learn from chlIdhood to deal with others particularly authority figures, in a reactive fashion. One of the behaviors most likely to gener~te a reactive response is being told lies or distorted facts. For children, lying universally generates a strong reaction from the significant adult in their lives. Most children are heavily pro\u00ad grammed with negative values toward deception or distortion of facts, and cQ,ntinue to react negatively toward lying when they become adults. However, an interviewer who wru\\J.ts to be suc\u00ad cessful needs to understand rationally why people lie or distort. The interviewer's very act of at\u00ad tempting to understand will allow interaction to take place. One of the most common reasons for lying or distorting the truth is to make oneself look good. Everyone wants to be regarded positively by others. When placf~d in a threatening situation, thefirst thought many people have is to. protect their image; they do not want to look foolish. They will then attempt to cover up those elements of the truth that threaten them. People may use a variety of defense mechanisms to make themselves look good. If the interviewer reacts to those defense mechanisms, he will generate even more defensive behavior. The distortion escalates and it becomes continually more difficult for the person who is lying to retreat to the truth. By this time, the interviewee realizes the distortion itself has become an issue, and to admit having told a lie will only add to the officer's perception that the credibility of the interviewee is suspect. The officer's best option for maintaining control of an interview or interrogation situation is to understand the dynamics of defensive behavior. The officer also needs to understand how the use of defensive behavior by another person can potentially affect him. However, even though an officer tries to understand another person on his terms does not automatically mean that the officer is ac- cepting the behavior that is being displayed. Several planned responses can help keep the interviewer in the role of interactor. These tactics in\u00ad clude the mirror response, paraphrasing, and the use of feeling responses. The Mirror Response. As its name implies, the mirror response involves repeating, or \"mirroring back,\" what the interviewee has just said. Obviously, if this technique is overused, it can cause the conversation to become unnecessarily repetitive. It is valuable, however, to ensure correct understanding and to provide an opportunity for the older person to recall details that become available as the incident recedes in time and long term memory begins to work. It is also a critical tool when interviewing an aphasiac (someone whc suffers from a speech disability caused by brain cell damage). The mirror response technique is simple: Older Person: \"The man seemed so familiar. I wonder if I haven't seen him before?\" 111-10 \"I want to make sure I understand what you are saying. You think the man looked familiar and you might have seen him somewhere before.\" or \"Correct me if I'm wtong, but ... \" Paraphrasing. In paraphrasing, the interviewer repeats in his own words what the interviewee has just said. The advantage of this approach is the interpretation of a defjned situation from an objec\u00ad tive, outside perspective. The melding of viewpoints crystalizes the intent of the message to both the interviewer and interviewee. This technique also eliminates the redundancy of mirror-response: Old~r Person: \"The man seemed so familiar. I wonder if I haven't seen him somewhere before?\" Police Officer: \"You think it might be somebody you know or have seen around town?\" Feeling Response. A person can state clearly what is on his mind without really explaining how he feels about it. The person may feel angry, resentful, embarrassed, confused, or amused, among others. His feelings may be directed at whatever he is tallcing about, or they may be reflecting his at\u00ad titude toward the presence of the law enforcement officer. Knowing how a person feels about the information being related is necessary to understand and interpret facts. Knowing how a person feels about the present situation and his attitude toward the officer is important for maintaining effective person-to-person communication. The officer may need to use a \"feeling response\" to identify these attitudes, to help verbalize them, and to determine what they are related to. He may begin the \"feeling response\" with a ten\u00ad tative statement, such as: \"It sounds to be like you are. , .\" or \"I think I hear you saying ... \" By using a combination of these verbal communi(;ation techniques, the officer can understand better what an older person thinks and how he feels about the situation while encouraging continued communication and increased trust. Vocal characteristics, or how the voice is used, can create communication problems. It is not un\u00ad common for older persons to have hearing difficulties. If the law enforcement officer, while trying to ~ompensate for the older person's difficulty, begins to shout or to pace his words too deliberately or m an exaggerated monotone, then the listener might begin to feel uncomfortable, \"talked down to,\" or scolded. Skillful communication by the officer in this instance generally calls for speaking clearly and comfortably. The person who is talking provides other \"clues\" which tell an officer what his emotional level is like. For example, disrupted speech (stuttering or stammering), tremulousness, chi:mges in intona\u00ad tion (usually low to high), nervous or misplaced laughter, or intensity that seems unwarranted under the circumstances can all indicate that the person is giving the officer faked or staged answers. 111-11 , I [ r {- I r culture's heavy reliance on words frequently causes us to ignore or underemphasize the non\u00ad verbal channels of communication. The value of reading and accurately interpreting non-verbal communication signals, or body language as this process is commonly called, should not be underestimated. Body language is a valuable data channel because it is so difficult to fake. People cannot see themselves respond, especially the most expressive parts of their bodies-their faces. The law enforcement officer can achieve a broader understanding of the older person's point of view by observing non-verbal cueg\" He cIJ.n also avoid misunderstandings about his own point of view by making sure he does not send out the wrong non-verbal cues to the person being inter- viewed. When non-v(\";rbal cues seem to ~atch the words being spoken, they are said to be congruent with the verbal message. If the non-verbal cues suggest something different than the words being spoken, they are incongruent; when this happens listeners have a \"vague, gnawing feeling that something is not right.\" Such a feeling, sometimes called intuitive, is usually correct. Rather than intuition, however, the listener is probably reacting to the lack of congruency between the verbal and non- verbal channels. When communicating wUh an older person, a variety of non-verbal signals are particu}afIy impor\u00ad tant. Eye Contact. Our culture values eye con.tact during communication. Establishing and maintaining periodic eye contact indicates interest and concern. However, constant eye contact ca!1 be upsetting, so it is wise for the officer to establish a pattern of rocusing on the other person's ~y-'es, looking away, and then re-establishing eye contact. With older people, eye contact can have as-e,?ondary pay-off: the officer may discover that the interview~e is not able to see very well, is uncomfott~ble, or is ill at ease, ''', \"'\" A person is uncomfort.able during an interview when he refuses to establish eye contact, deliberately and uncomfortably avoids iooking the officer in the face, rolls his eyes and changes their focal point, or squints frequently.7 A common interpretation of such eye signals might be, \"go away, I don't want to deal\" with you.\" Body language varies according to a person's cultural background as well. Officers must take these cultural factors into consideration when interpreting body language signals. For example, it is commcn in the some cultures to avert one's eyes from a person in authority, particularly if the com\u00ad munication involves an allegation of wrongdoing. To interpret such behavior as indicating guilt or lying might well be inaccurate. Hand Signals. An interviewee can send a-variety of clues about how he feels by using his hands. For example, clenched fists typically indicate that the speaker fully supports what he is saying.8 The fists communicate forcefulness. However clenched fists are typically a masculine gesture and are seldom used by women. ,_, 111-12 \" Clenching the hands together can indicate frustration or suspicion. 9 When the clenched hands progress to the poh~t of a wringing motion, the person may be feeling as though he is on the \"hot seat,n and the discut1fJion is a threat to him. \\ ~ Some success in relie\\\\~'ng tension may be achieved by using gestures of openness toward ~he inter\u00ad viewee. Leaning toward him and exposing the trunk of the body will suggest trust and reassurance. Certain hand signals ~ugg~~t that the person is evaluating what is being said. It is useful for the of\u00ad ficer to be sensitive to wheth~r he is using them. For example, placing the hand under the chin wrapping the thumb around tht~ side of the chin, and extending the index finger up to the side of th~ nose indicates evaluation. If thJ,., hand motion is accompanied by leaning to.ward the speaker the suggestio~ is o~ten critical evahi\\'ition.l0 However, the officer should avoid \"steepling\" mo;ions when deahng wIth older persons. '}}le classic \"steepling\" position of the hands is usually interpreted as a signal of superiority. The pers<.\\n who uses this signal indicates that he is in command of what is happening. 11 \\ Gestures. Some people use gestures.more than others. Usually, the hands and arms are involved. Movements th~t ~tar~ away from the hody and move toward it generally are viewed as signals of openn~ss a~d .mvItatIon. The m,ore ~heArunk of the body is exposed (particularly the chest), the morehkely It IS that the person IS bemg ~)pen and honest. Frequently, a person will make small fint~er movements, as if he were brushing crumbs off a table. Such movements away from the,body may, indicate reje(~tion; the person is saying \"I don't want h G,,' , ~u ~. o~~. \\ \\ Folded arms may indicate defensiveness or d\\~fiance. This is especialiy true if the fists are clenched beneath the folded arms or if the person tutns ~,t a 45 degree angle to the other person in the conver- ~~. . Post.ure. ~osture is unquefitionably authonty fIgures. The offIcer s umform, badl\\:e, gunbelt and shiny metal only add to that author~tative ident~t~. It is valuable, then, for thei\\:pfficer to lessen any negative consequences of his authonty role by sIttmg down. But once he sits dOi,wn, the officer's positioning becomes important. Frequently, it is necessary for the officer to sit dl\\rectly in front of the older person. This lets the older person who has eye or ear trouble see the offil~er, read his lips if necessary, and watch his facial expressions. ., 'I '\\ . . Touch. An older person may touch, the officer (\\)r hold his arm or hand. The desire for human ~ontact is universal; it affects both the young and tpe old. fI~wever, touching may be particularly Important for the elderly person who may have fewelr personal contacts due to the deaths of friends . a~d thea~sence .of fami~y members. In some cases i'pe officer will need to touch the older person, \u00b7\u00b7elther to dIrect hIS attentIon or to reassure and comfdrt him. While touching may seem awkward for tileofficer in some situations, due to sociological and age group differences, it is incumbent upon theo{ficer to overcome such inhibitions. 111-13 , :~I 'I ;-'( \\ \\ I \\1 I.

ThIS IS most true when t e In truder is a stranger. Zones Intimate Intimate Personal Personal Social Social Public Public 111-14 ,-- / There are four zones surrounding each person, which may be visualized as concentric circles, with the person in the center. As another person moves from the outer edge of the farthest circle toward the center, he increasingly becomes a nuisance or a threat. The farthest zone is that which typically extends from 12 to 25 feet or more. This distance is usual\u00ad ly non-threatening for most people, because someone in it is too far away to be perceived as a danger unless their behavior is bizarre or thl~y are making overt threats. This is the \"public\" zone.I3 The next closer zone is the \"sqcial\" zone.14 It extends from four to 12 feet. This is the area within which casual conversations maybe carried on. It is the comfortable party chatter zone. The \"personal\" zone extends from one and one-half to four feel' from the body. IS This area is u~ually restricted to persons one knows well, such as relatives and close friends. Others who intrude into, this zOne can make the focal person uncomfortable unless there is a sound social reason for the intnisipn, such as a crowded bus. However, one only needs to watch behavior on\" an elevator to realize how uncom~ortable a person can be if he is in such close proximity to a stranger. The close'st zone is the \"intimate\" zone, which extends from actually touching the focal person's body to about .one and one-half feet.16 This area is restricted to persons who are invited to be that close. In the intimate zone, physical touch is the uppermost in each person's awareness. In most non-crime situations, officers deal with people in either the personal or the social zones. If they have been invited into the personal zone, such as when they are performing a requested ser\u00ad vice, there is usually no problem. However, if they are intruding that close, they should be aware that the person ,may react negatively. Officers are usually taught to take positions in relation to other people that will give the officer the advantage if a physical confrontation develops. This usually means standing slightly to the per\u00ad son's weak side at a 45 degree angle, close enough to be able to grab the person if necessary. Since such training literally helps the officer survive, it is internalized quickly and becomes habitual. Thus, when the officer is dealing with a non-crime related situation, he may unconsciously position himself defensively. Obviously, there are two drawbacks to the officer's defensive positioning if the subject of the in\u00ad terview is an older person. First, standing to the older person's side may complicate communication if he suffers from a hearing difficulty or failing eyesight. Second, this position usually requires the officer to intrude into the personal zone, which could irritate or confuse the older person. Such feel\u00ad ings can quickly escalate because older persons frequently feel more vulnerable to victimization of any kind than do younger persons. When dealing with the older victim, witness, or seeker of service, the officer should explain movements to him and ask permission to enter the older person's personal zone. This can be done under the guise of escorting him to a chair, the patrol car, or a more comfortable interview site. Moving into the older person's personal zone provides an opportunity for the officer to test his hearing and eyesight. This is accomplished by speaking at various volume levels and by averting the face to see if the older person can still hear the message without having an opportunity to read the officer's lips. III-IS Sensitivity to the use of space must be learned. Careful observation of how people position themselves in everyday activities will help the officer develop this skill. Most people will un\u00ad consciously position themselves at comfortable distances from other people. Regular attention to the tendency to do so will help an officer establish his use of space as a communicative tool. The Arena In Which Communication Occurs The arena, or the setting, in which communication takes place influences both the content and the form of messages sent and received. The effective communicator must be aware of his or her sur\u00ad roundings and their impact on the communication flow. it Type Of Space. A first consitleration is the type of space in which the communication occurs. Is it out of doors, on a busy street corner, in a patrol car, in the older person's home, in a police depart\u00ad ment office, or in some other setting? The answer to this question should tell the officer something about how to handle the sending and receiving of messages. If the setting is familiar to the older person, such as his home, then he will probably be relatively comfortable. The officer should make an effort to build on this. It will influence the conversation's pace as well as the speed with which the officer might be able to introduce traumatic issues or ques\u00ad tions. W\"~i1. the interviewee is in a familiar surrounding, there will be many opportunities for the officer to diwrt the conversation from the subject at hand if this becomes necessary. Personal possessions may become a topic of conversation, as may photographs. If the older person deliberately diverts the conversation to talk about his personal possessions, then the officer must determine whether it is because the interviewee is uncomfortable with' what is being discussed, or whether he finds it easier to deal with things from long term memory. Based on an analysis of the probable cause, the officer can gently lead the discussion back to the original topic. If the setting where the communication takes place is out of doors, the officer should be aware of the many distractions that will impede the smooth flow of information. Traffic noises s pedestrians, bright sunlight, and a great deal of movement can combine to confuse an older person. It is more difficult for the older person to concentrate when there is constant motion around him. Also, if the older person suffers from the common visual difficulty known as glare re~istance, he may find it im\u00ad possible to distinguish objects from one another. A high level of noise around him may prevent an older person from hearing spoken words clearly. If the individual suffers from a higher noise threshold than the younger officer, then the officer. may not understand the problem and try to compensate by speaking louder. The correct response to this difficulty is to remove the background noise; this means that the officer must move the interview to a more quiet location. If the officer chooses to move the interview to a patrol car, problems of glare and distracting mo\u00ad tions may still persist. In addition, the older person may focus on the radio and other police-related equipment in the vehicle. If the officer takes time to explain what he wants to accomplish and to comment (\"small talk\") about some of the equipment, the older person's curiosity probably will be satisfied and the interview can proceed. Still, the patrol vehicle is not a satisfactory interview site. III-16 I . ; Interviews conduc.ted in a police depart.ment office have advantages over those conducted in the stre~t because there IS greater control over distractions. However, the older person is in unfamiliar terntor! an~ prob~bly will be uncomfortable. Also, the office setting can be sterile and formal. If the. offI~er SitS beh~nd a desk. opposite !he older person'l then he is emphasizing his authority and SOCial ~Istance, which may. alIenate the mterviewee. It can be much more difficult to establish rap\u00ad ~ort with an older person m a police office setting. Preparatory \"small talk\" may consume more tIme than would be required in other settings. The choice of an inte~view site is not always open. Many times, the officer and the older person meet at the scene of a CrIme or other traumatic incident. If the officer must quickly broadcast crime suspect da~~, request other e~ergency equipment (e.g., an ambulance), or make rapid decisions ab?ut a crItical course of actIOn, then he will not have time to seek a more suitable location As q~lckly as such priority activities are completed, however, the officer should a;sess the fram~ of mmd of the older person to determine if moving to another site would be appropriate. Pr0p,s. The use of props usually brings to mind acting. In a sense, a controlled interview setting is much.lIke a stage, and many people use props to help them \"get into their part.\" If they do so un\u00ad consciously, howeve~, they may be missing the true value props can have. But if they use props pur\u00ad posefully, they may mcrease their effectiveness. An~ physical object that ca~ be m~~ipulated as part of the communicative act is a prop. Common .pro~s mclude .eyeglasses, pencIls, wrItmg pads, and small items that can be used either to attract at\u00adtentIOn or to Illustrate a point. Nervous .habits some~imes surface through props. The unconscious rolling of a pencil or pen be\u00ad tween the f~ngers or takmg off and putting on eyeglasses are excellent examples. Desk items, such as a paper weight or letter opener, can serve the same purpose (which usually is to expend nervous energy). . The conscious use of a pencil as a pointer with which to illustrate or emphasize what is being said ~s perhaps the In:0s.t common use ?f a prop. However, it can be overdone, and it can have negative Impact because It IS usually perceived as being a very authoritarian gesture. The use of a pad of paper, wh~n combined with the judicious use of a pencil or pen as pointer, can ~e very helpful. Older persons wIll be extremely conscious of note-taking in their presence. If the of\u00ad flc~r occasIOnally shows the older person what he is writing, underlining important points, then this actI~n can help ~ake an .older person more comfortable. It is also helpful to draw simple diagrams to VIsually deSCrIbe phYSical settings which are important to the discussion. ~n the olde~ person's home, most of the available props will belong to him. However, the umformed offIcer. should not mis.s the opportunity to make points by using police paraphernalia. For example, the s~mple act o.f takmg off a hat or helmet when entering the room will be well regard\u00ad e~ by the ?lder p:rson. ~avmg notepaper and the appropriate forms readily and neatly available wIll help give the ImpreSSIOn of efficiency and professionalism. If the oPP?rtunity arises, the. officer i? eit~eJ; a ~ome or office setting can use props to test an older person s sensory perception. Askmg him dIscreetly if he can see certain objects or read III-17 , _. something held at a reasonable distance will give the officer an idea of the older person's visual perception abilities. Asking him to take a small object from the officer's extended hand may provide a clue about both visual ability and coordination. When using a prop, the officer should try to ensure that it does not become a distraction. Asking the older person to shift his focal point rapidly may result in disorientation for him. It is also imp or- t~nt not to let a prop become the sole object of the conversation. . Awareness of the arena and its components will help the law enforcement officer gain greater con\u00ad trol over the communication process. The setting, its furnishings, the psychological impact they have on the participants in the communication, and the props available are material elements in the control formula. THE CAUSE OF THE COMMUNICATIVE CONTACT: CRIME-RELATED AND NON-CRIME RELATED SITUATIONS Purposefulness in communication implies that the officer is sensitive to the c~use of the .contac.t. Thus, he may tailor the form and substance of the conversation. At the most b~SIC l~vel, 0r~Icer~ wIll contact older persons in situations involving crimes or in non-crime related SItuatIOns WhIch eIther require a direct gervice or a referral to other services. The crime related situations in which an officer may have to deal with an older person include: the older personas a criminal offender, as a crime victim, or as a witness to a crime. Older Persons As Offenders How should a law enforcement officer conduct himself when dealing with an older person who is a criminal offender? Four points are worth special consideration: 1. O.on't stereotype the older offender as a vagrant or a \"dirty old man.\" 2. Realize that older offenders are generally apprehended for the same offenses as persons in other age groups. Except for their age, they are really not very different. 3. Understand that any of the following situations may be influencing the deviant behavior: f I a. Loss. The inability to adjust to a loss, whether real or imagined, can lead to deviant behavior. Bereavement, for example, may lead to excessive drinking in later life. b. Health Problems. Older persons often incur chronic illnesses and pains. For example, in a case of disorderly conduct the suspect may have undergone an operation or recently ab\u00ad sorbed a psychological shock of some kind. c. Restraint. There arle many physical and social restraints on the lives and activities of older persons, including society's negative attitudes toward sexuality in the older person, which may have influenced an older person to commit some criminal offense. It should also be III-I 8 .-. _____ = \" . . \" noted that the anticipation, as well as the realization of losses, health problems, or restraints mE',y influence older persons and affect their behavior. ., 4. Realize that the older person must adapt to the stresses and losses that are part of aging. They may be acting out some form of social delinquency to compensate for unmet needs arising from these changes. Of course, while this may be an explanation, it should not be considli!red an excuse for criminal behavior. The Older Person As A Crime Victim The number of all victims who 'report crime is quite low. Less than half contact the police.l8 Studies have confirmed that this is true among older age groups as well. Some common reasons that older persons give for not reporting crimes include: 1. The police could not do anything and there was no reason to report; 2. The incident was too trivial to report to the police; or, 3. A fear of reprisal, as indicated by the quote: \"The likelihood of the offender being sent to jail is negligible and you will have to face him on the streets. Even if the offender is sent to jail, his friends will get even with you.\" 19 Dealing with an older victim of a crime requires sensitivity. It is a classic example of a situation in which efficiency-getting job done in the fastest possible way -is the wrong criterion for success in this regard. The officer instead should strive for effectiveness, and this requires that he deal with the victim as a person in need of help. Quite often an efficient officer is viewed as too impersonal and indifferent to the victim's plight. This complaint is lodged more often in cases involving crimes against property than in cases which involve crimes against the person.20 Such property crimes are so common the officer may become hardened to their human impact; however, to the elderly person, the loss of his property is extremely important and emotionally upsetting, particularly if he lives on a small fixed income. It is also important for the preliminary investigator to be honest; he should try not to give the older person an unreasonable expectation for solution of the crime or recovery of the property. When the probabilities of recovering stolen property are remote, the investigator should be candid with the older victim. The Older Person As A Crime Witness Interviewing witnesses requires skill and patience. Admittedly, the officer's attitude toward the older witness will affect his ability to use effective interview techniques. Although some older witnesses wiIl be ineffective because of severe physical impairments, older p.ersons as a group gener\u00ad ally may be classified as very effective witnesses.21 Older persons often are keenly aware of other age levels. They exercise mature judgment and have the leisure time for careful observation. An officer should always challenge himself to develop good interview techniques which maximize the effec\u00ad tiveness of a witness; age should be a factor in assessing what techniques to use. III-19 , , , i -----------~-- When approaching an older witness, the officer should first identify himself and his department. He should explain his role and responsibilities to older persons, many of whom have probably had more contact with television cops than with real law enforcement officers. As discussed earlier, one reliable technique to establish quick rapport is \"small talk.\" The officer can win a high level of confidence and trust and can also \\lise \"small talk\" to evaluate the reliability of the witness as a source of information. While maintaining a businesslike manner, he can turn the simple conversation toward obtaining needed information. Effective fact-gathering generally requires controlling the problem many older people have with sticking to the subject. However, the officer should not break off an older person's rambling discourse too quickly. Older persons often take longer to process information and to organize and report the facts. Premature interruptions on the part of the investigating officer may keep important facts from being reve~led. If he is writing the report while he is conducting the interview, the officer may find that the older witness becomes more interested in watching what is being written than in relating the facts. The older witness may become hesitant to divulge information if everything he says is being written down. By listening first and then writing the report, the officer can sometimes circumvent such pro\u00ad blems. It is also useful to explain to the older person what is being recorded. During an interview, an older person may not remember all the things he wants to say. Or he may be sensitive about vision and hearing difficulties and want to avoid disclosing this information-he may be embarrassed by his own confusion. It is important fGr the officer to convince and reassure the older person that he really wants and needs additional information. Basic communication skills, especially responses which indicate that the officer feels sympathetic toward the older person, are good for breaking down these barriers. Saying, for example, \"I know how traumatic the experience must have been,\" can encourage continued communication. In closing the interview, the officer should explain exactly what will be done in the investigation. He should not give false hopes of solving the crime, but instead should assure the older person that the department is going to do everything possible to take care of the situation. He should exit as graciously and cooperatively as possible, even though he may be frustrated and any hope that the case will be solved may be futile at that point. If at all possible, the officer should conduct some kind of case foUow-up-a short memo or phone call to the elderly witnefss will make a difference. Generally, older people as a group strongly support law enforcement activities and are favorably impressed by police service.22 However, there is an interesting distinction between older persons who called the police for a general type of service and victims who had called to report a crime. Of those who called the police for general aid, 83 percent thought the response was good. Of all persons who had reported victimization, however, only 68 percent were satisfied with what the police did.23 Ef\u00ad fective and sensitive communication with elderly victims and witnesses of crime will, in all likelihood, keep their favorable impressions of the police at a high level. Older Person In Non-Crime Situations There are many non-crime situations in which law enforcement officers encounter the elderly. Some of these problems are described in the material which follows. 111-20 Caller. Many times when older persons telephone the police department, they only may have imagined problems, or they may be lonely and just want to talk to someone. Chronic com\u00ad plainers frequendy call about problems with children in their neighborhood. Some assistance in dealing with chronic callers can be obtained by establishing working relationships with social service agencies, or by arranging visits from volunteers. Care should be taken not to treat \"chronic callers\" too lightly. On occasion, the problem is real and serious and may require a police response. Older Driver. Older drivers generally have had many years of driving experience and tend to be more cautious in their driving habits than younger p!~rsons.24 Moreover, the older driver generally avoids driving in bad weather, high traffic areas, rush-hour traffic, and night-time traffic. Never\u00ad theless, studies show that when driving exposure is donsidered, the older population has a higher crash experience per mile traveled than the middle-aged, and about equal to that of the young.25 The older driver has greater difficulty in accommodating visually to varied distances and adapting to dark and light. He may suffer from reduced visual acuity and poor hearing, experience slower reaction times, and show greater susceptibility to conlfusion when responding to mUltiple, concur- rent stimuli. ' The older person may miss traffic lights or signs: because of their location, or because his peripheral vision is constricted and he has a slower reaction time. His knowledge of traffic laws may not be up-to-date and he may be unaware of some common safe driving practices. To help elderly drivers, the police officer on patrol can note overhanging traffic lights, stop signs that are higher than usual, and signs obstructed by natural overgrowth. He can then contact the authorities in charge of other city services to get the problems remedied. These measures will help to prevent ac\u00ad cidents. When he encounters an older driver who is having difficulties, the officer might ask certain ques\u00ad tions. Does the older person take medication? Has he taken it recently? Does he need to do so? Is he diabetic? The older person may be preoccupied; may have poor c\\\\riving habits, a slower reaction time, or vi\u00ad sion problems. If so, he needs to recognize his deficienci(\\s. Multiple physiological changes must be adjusted for in a driving situation. Can the older person r(lad the officer's name tag or the patrol car license plate? Does he refuse to try? Or, if the older driver is hard of'hearing, can the officer com\u00ad municate with him? Re-examination citations, as an alternati'~'~ to arrest or license revocation, may be given to the older driver who is stopped by an Officer, especially in areas which do not require periodic re\u00ad examination after the age of 65. The police officer needs to assess the capabilities of the individual older driver, and given the considerations previously discus~\\ed, make an intelligent decision in the best interests of the public safety and the welfare of the older person involved. Wandering Older Adult. Situations involving wandering ohier adults may vary, from hopeless to discretionary. The hopeless situation is typified by the elderly lady with her shopping bags who is destitute and without a home b family, or frie~ds. She repeatedly runs away after referral to social 111-21 , service agencies. A discretionary situation can occur when an elderly person, out walking the dog, has simply wandered into an unfamiliar part of the neighborhood and is lost and ~mbarrassed. (One good-natured and sensitive officer explained how he handled such a situation-by dropping an older man off a few blocks from his home so his wife would never know about the accident.) Family Problems. All experienced law enforcement officers must be prepared to intervene in family problem incidents involving older persons. These may involve such diverse situations as disagreements over family finances, to drunken arguments, and threatened suicides. Good com\u00ad munication skills will determine the officer's success in dealing with any of these situations. CONCLUSION Communicative skills are critical tools of effective law enforcement. Planned responses to the many situations in which law enforcement officers will encounter older persons rely on und.erstan\u00ad ding what communication is and how it functions. The officer must be aware of the verbal and non\u00ad verbal communication channels, the environment within which the communicating takes place, and the roles he and others play. Most importantly, the officer must be sensitive to himself, and alert to his own biases, value judgments, and assumptions as well as those of the older person. Such self-knowledge is the key to being able to establish rapport with others. That key will open the door to successful problem\u00ad solving in dealing with the entire spectrum of law enforcement and older persons. SUMMARY An officer's ability to communicate skillfully probably is the most significant determinant of his professienal effectiveness. Developing effective communication skills requires practice. The officer must learn the elements of communication, how messages are transmitted and received, and factors which inhibit effective communication. When communicating with older persons, the officer should be aware that he may have to utilize special communication techniques because of visual or auditory problems which the older person may have. Effective communication with older persons requires patience on the of\u00ad ficer's part. The officer who makes an effort to communicate with older persons will often find that they provide him with valuable and needed information. In order to communicate effectively with older persons, the officer must be aware of his own biases, value judgments, and assumptions about the aging process. Officers must be sensitive to the older person's attitudes and points of view; he must realize that the older person also is seeking information and assistance from the communicative act. The officer should leave the older person with a positive attitude about the encounter. His communication with the older person should be effective -the older person should be satisfied both with the content of the message and the manner in which it was delivered. 111-22 . ,\\ Ill( REFERENCES 1.

LESSON TWO PROGRAMMING WITH OLDER PERSONS ,) Law enforcement agencies regularly conduct educational and informational programs for v,(',rions segments of the community. The elements of a successful program presentation do :I'l~t vary significantly from one target group to another. However, the emphasis given to each ektmeT'it does differ, as does the ability of ,each audience to participate in the learning process. Since the older audience has special problems and needs, this lesson emphasizes how to plfln~ de,vclop, and present effective programs for and to this age group. Lectures and films, followed by discussions or question-and-answer pC2'.1'1ods, prove to be better learning experiences for older persons than do formal lecture' presentations.! In all situations, however, basic communicative skills are needed to deliver the message effectivelY. To present a pro\u00ad gram to an older audience, the speaker's talk must be properly paced and well-organized; in addi\u00ad tion, the speaker needs to know how to use memory cues and visual aids. Other factors, such as a supportive environment, audience participation, and meaningful content also contribute to effective programming for older persons. Practical consideration of physical fac\u00ad tors such as outside interference, rest breaks, lighting, room temperature, and even accessibility to the meeting area is equally important. /1 Each of these factors should be considered when designing educational and informational pro\u00ad grams for older persons. PROGRAM PLANNING Planning a program presentation includes consideration of several factors which are examined in later sections of this lesson. In this sense, it is important not to regard this section as wholly self\u00ad contained. Rather, its purpose is to emphasize the importance of careful planning to ensure the pro\u00ad per coordination of all other programmatic efforts. There are many planning approaches which will yield a successful program. Each has its unique elements. A useful composite avproach is represented by the acronym STAR: (S)tudents, (T)rain\u00ad ing, (A)tmosphere, and (R)equirements. In these four elements one finds the most important plann\u00ad ing steps. Students: Who Are The Targets? While \"student\" may not be the most accurate term to represent the person in the older audience, it nonetheless serves to identify the most crucial variable in program planning. The persons who are 111-25 . . ' .. , \"It' ~ to receive information k~y be viewed as \"target;~\" The outer ring. of th: program planner's \"target\" contains the most general descriptions of the audience. towar? t~e center, each ~uccessive concentric: ring furthei' refines what is known about the audIence untIl, m the bullseye, one finds its most specific chara,cteristics. The first step in planning a program prese~tation is to assess' the ~haracteristics ~f poten~ial par- t\u00b7\u00b7 t -a useful \"target\" can then be drawn. The crime preventIon or commumty relatIOns of\u00adICIpan s . f' . I 'f' sfons to ficer responsible for presenting the program should ask a seI:Ies 0 mcreasmg y spec! IC que .1 ensure that he fully understands the audience's composition and needs. Some of the questIons he should ask are: What is the source 9f the program? .. Has it been requested specifically by a sponsoring group or agency? 0 Is it one of a series scheduled in advance by the law enforceme,nt agency? Is it part of a more encompassing program? The answers to these questions will begin to establish the context for the program presentat~on. For example if the presentation has been requested by a sponsoring group, then the representatIves of that gro~p can provide a sense of why they requested it. The program planner should seek answers to such questions as: What occurrence or concern led to the program request? If there were no specific occurrences or concerns, why did the group decide to request a presen\u00ad tation on a specific crime prevention topic? Who in the group 'specifically wants the program? What are the characteristics of the group? Age? Affiliation? Neighborhood? Economic status (if this is not too sensitive a question)? Sex? Ethnic background? If the program is one of a series scheduled in advance-or even periodically- by the law en~orc~\u00ad ment agency, the q'!lestions may differ. While the planner of a regularly ~cheduled pro~r~m IS stIll interested in audience characteristics, his focus shifts somewhat to determme where p~rtIclpants are most likely to come from, such as a specific neighborhood with numero~s street m~ggmgs ~f elderly residents. The planner also must examine his own motives for selectmg the tOPIC, 10catI~n, and audience. Are those motives in line with the interests of the target group? O~, are they defI~ed too much in terms of the department's purposes? A successful program is one WhICh says somethmg the participants need to hear. If the planner is preparing a short presentation which wi~l be ~~rt of a .larger progra~, such as a day-long workshop, he must add several questions to those IdentIfIed earlIer. Some addItional ques\u00ad tions he might want to ask are: What is the overall topic of the workshop or conference? , Who are the .What are the other elements of the program~~ .. How are the participants being recruited? What is the sponsor \"promising\" the participants? Will every participant be a part of the planner's session, or will they be choosing from among a \"menu\" of workshops or presentations? It is impossible to know too much about a prospective audience. It is possible, however, to collect so many details that one loses sight of their use. The purpose for analyzing the\"audience is to help in making decisions about what to say, why it should be said, where to say it, and how to say it. Training: What To Say And Why In practice, the \"why\" question comes first; it is essentially the reason for the program itself. What is the need the program must meet? Was the topic requested by a host group? D~d an aiIalysis of crime and service trends conducted by the law enforcement agency suggest a need for programs on the selected topic? Is the audience likely to be receptive? Do they want to hear the message? The more general the topic, the more applicable it is to a variety of audiences. Conversely, the more narrow-focused the topic\" the more relevant it is to a specific audience. The program planner should bear in mind that interest on the part of the listener will relate directly to how the message af\u00ad fects him personally. If an objective of the program is to stimulate action on the part of the audience, then the message must be applicable specifically to that audience. This means that having a Eeries of \"canned\" programs which are general enough to present throughout the jurisdiction will ,/be convenient for the speaker but less interesting to a given audience. ~ ; (I ~\\ The program planner must develop a list of objectives for each program. At the top of this list will be the most general and fundamental goal or purpose of the specific program presentation; it will help the planner develop more specific objectives. The fundamental goal statement must reflect whether the program aims merely to inform members of the audience about a particular subject, or whether it aspires to change the behavior of program attendees. If the basic intent is to inform, then the more specific objectives may be stated in passive terms. For example, an objective may be stated, \"The participant will be informed about the most com\u00ad mon street crimes committed against persons over the age of 55.\" Information-oriented objectives may also be stated in intellectual terms, such as, \"The participant will be able to know (or under\u00ad stand, or perceive) the importance of depositing checks immediately in a bank account.\" It is easy to measure whether or not the program presentor accomplishes passively stated objec\u00ad tives. He has succeeded if he has performed his task satisfactorily. For the objective in the preceding paragraph to be met, the program presentor only has to list the most common street crimes commit\u00ad ted against the target population. Those crimes may;,be listed orally, flashed on a screen by using overhead projections, or listed in a handout or brochure. III-27 / 'i \\, \" ~ \"] iI tl ;; 'I Ii '! ,I . i Intellectually stated objectives, on the other hand, are slightly more difficult to measure. They re\u00ad quire that the presentor test whether the program participants-or a selected portion of the par-' ticipants-can show that they have in fact understood what was said. This can be accomplished rather easily by a question-and-answer period, or ,by a simple evaluation form distributed at the end of the program for either immediate or later collection. If the basic intent of the program is to change behavior, then the statements of objectives will be drastically different. In this case, they will say something like, \"Participants will be able to identify the personal behaviors that make them susceptible to street crimes and will plan behavioral changes to reduce their susceptibility.\" While this objective falls short of proving act:ual behavioral change, it is probably as much as the program planner can expect. It is not reasonable to require follow-up action to determine whether behavior does change unless the program is part of a more in-depth crime prevention effort. Recognizing the fundamental outcome desired from a program presentation allows the planner to develop his objectives with a greater degree of comfort than would otherwise be possible. Evaluating program success is also made easier by writing down the expected outcome. It is likely that some programs will be solely informational while others will be change-directed. Most programs, however, probably will fall somewhere between these polar extremes. The program plan should list the objectives in concise, simple language. It is not necessary for anyone else to know the objectives. Their purpose is to guide the planner in developing the program, in selecting message content, in structuring the message, in determining delivery methods, and in personally evaluating the success of a given presentation. When the \"why\" question has been answered to the planner's satisfaction and he moves to the point of specifying objectives, answers to the \"what\" questions flow almost automatically. The pro\u00ad blem then becomes one of proper organization. Atmosphere And Requirements: Where And How To Say It The final elements of a program plan deal with the physical environment where the program will be presented and with the equipment and resource materials required by the speaker. The physical environment is a critical factor in successfully delivering a program. There will be times when the program planner does not have any control over the program site itself. When this happens, the only options available to the program planner involve the organization and duration of the presentation-if the physical facility is inadequate and cannot be modified, then the program must be structured to work around the worst physical features. This might require shortening the pre~entation time, using more (or fewer) visual aids, dividing the audience into smaller groups and conducting \"buzz sessions,\" or making other concessions to cramped, poorly lighted, poorly ven\u00ad tilated, cavernous, or otherwise unsuitable \u00b7;surroundings. The best way to determine the adequacy of a location is to visit it sufficiently in advance of the presentation to select an alternate site if necessary (and if it is possible). If the program planner can- \"'~, I .-111-28 . ,. y \\ , . ,,' I not visit the site, then a telephone interview with the proprietor or with someone familiar with the site will help. Several considerations in planning how to present a program focus on the room itself: 1. What is its size? Shape? 2. What is its seating capacity? 3. What kind of tables and chairs are available? Are they moveable? Are they comfortable? 4. Is the room convenient to other rooms which will be used (such as sp:lall breakout rooms for discussions)? 5. What is the entrance/exit layout? 6. Are the building and room accessible to the handicapped (some elderly persons use walkers and wheelchairs)? ' 7. Are there convenient rest rooms? 8. What is the adequacy of: Heating/air conditioning? Ventilation (especially to there darkening drapes? Lighting? What is the lighting type? Is it rheostat-controlled? May the room lights be dimmed without creating total darkness? Floor coverings: Carpet? Tile/linoleum? What is the room height? cords? to. Are there any charges for the equipment listed above? If so, the program presentor may want to use his agency's equipment~theplanner will need to make certain that the equipment is delivered to the meeting site and that the program presentor knows how to operate it. In addi\u00ad tion, the equipment will need to be returned to the agency. Other questions focus on the building and area within which the meeting room is located: 1. Is the neighborhood perceived as safe? Is it actually safe? 111-29 , -----.--.-- - 2. What is the accessibility to public transportation? 3. What is the parking availability? 4. Is the meeting room being used for other programs immediately before, during, or after the planned presentation? Depending upon the length of the program and the planner's responsibility for such things as refreshments, questions might also determine whether it is necessary for the law enforcement agency to supply coffee, water, tea, soft drinks, sugar, cream, cups, glasses, and ice. Other questions should deal with the availability of telephones, the convenience of restrooms, and what cleanup arrangements must be made. The law enforcement agency will not always be responsible for attending to these details. In most cases, the planner will simply be preparing a presentation to be delivered to a group at a site of their choosing. However, even if the program planner is not the overall sponsor, it is in his best interests to ask many of these questions. They will help him develop the final plan-for example, if he had planned a program based largely around small group discussions, he better find out in advance if there are breakout rooms for these discussions; otherwise, his meeting room will become very noisy with dozens of people talking at once in groups and gradually the participants will lose interest in their own group's discussion session. Five conditions, at a minimum, need to be given special attention. Interference. Outside interference, distractions, and noise in the program area must be kept at a minimum. Selecting a program time which avoids peak use of the facility can help in this regard. It will also help to structure the program so that only one thing happens at a time. Explaining one item well before undertaking a second will minimize concentration difficulties and will take into account the older adult's shorter attention span. Lighting. Programs $hould be conducted in a well-lighted room. Any uncontrolled natural light, such as sunlight shining through a large window, can create glare problems. In conditions of ar\u00ad tificiallighting, older persons will need more light than younger groups for comfortable vision. In\u00ad candescent lights are more comfortable than fluorescent lights. A single intense light source will also create problems with glare. Temperature. Older adults find it difficult to adjust to temperature changes. Cool or fluctuating room temperatures are the most uncomfortable. Older adults are generally more comfortable in temperatures that may be considered too warm by younger age groups.2 Physical Problems. Older adults may experience pronounced discomfort if they are forced to sit for a long period of time. Rest breaks should be provided about every 20 or 30 minutes so that par\u00ad ticipants can move about and use the restrooms. Tables and comfortable chairs are better for older III-30 f / .-.. 'j / ... ;,.- persons than are student-type chairs. Well-lighted and unobstructed corridors, hand grips on stairs, and clearly marked room numbers also create a safer and more accommodating physic;a} environ- ment for older people. . Accessibility. The plunner must consider time, place, and transportation factors. Mornings and afternoons are generally the times that older persons prefer to go places. The locatio:n should be convenient both in terms of available transportatio~ and access to the room where the program is to take. place (planners should always be aware that older audiences probably include people who use walkers, canes, or wheelchairs). Churches, senior centers, and locations near the homes of the elder\u00ad ly may be useful sites. Figure One provides an inventory form which can guide the program planner in identifying the characteristics of a meeting site. With the information Qbtained from such a form, the planner can more accurately construct the program itself. 111-31 , , , ~ j ~ I 1\\ I .-.... ~, , , PRESENTATION SKILLS Almost anything which must be absorbed (e.g., a written or spoken mess8,ge, a physical activity) is subject to some degree of organization. Informational and educational materials must be organized in advance by the speaker to help older adults learn. One useful way to acc()mplish this is to index and categorize smaller topics. into larger ones. The whore program should be summarized for the older audience before individual topics are discussed in detail . This technique has obVious benefitS-both for the presentor and for the audience. It forces the presentor to take the objectives he has identified and translate them into presentation modules Each module becomes a building block for the overall program. Consideration of one leads logically to consideration of the next. The listener benefits from that very logic. If the presentor summarizes the program by providing an outline to the members of the audience, they may more easily understand each individual topic. Thus, the program is presented in an orderly way and the audience finds it rel.atively simple to relate the parts to the whole.3 Older pers90salio l5()n,efit from the redundancy of both the written outline ..... .>. \\\\ and the spoken word. r;>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. \\\\ Ij . Since members oUhe audience will be mentally deciding how the material presented affects them personally, the presentation should focus on incidents which are easily identified or have occurred in the neighborhood as one way to drive home important points. This requires some research. While. there are numerous national, state, and regional studies which provide statistics and illustrative ex\u00ad amples of the crime and service problems of the older generation, over~reliance on such far-removed data diminishes the immediate impact of the message. It is also important to recognize the potential negative result of over-emphasizing statistics which amplify the plight of the older citizen. Obviously, the audience must hear the truth. However, the facts should not cause a frightened over-reaction, for that will tend to close the minds of the par\u00ad ticipants to the remedies the speaker might wish 'to suggest. The speaker should provide facts but should not embellish them with unnecessary \"war story\" illustrations. He should move quickly to understandable and reasonable prescriptions for minimizing risks to the listeners. Research on th~ topic is the single most critical determinant of the speaker's success. Even poor delivery can be excused if the speaker establishes that he is a master of the subject. Conversely, nothing is worse than \"being caught with your statistics down\" by a penetrating question from a member of the audience. It is useful to obtain the following information regarding any study or report which will be used as a basis for statements made in a presentation. 1. Person(s) or institution(s) conducting the study. 2. Sponsor(s) of the study (where did the money come from?). rr Ci 3. What was the objective of lUI U au SUSI / I i .1 4. What was the study population by: a. Age? b. Sex? c. Socio-economic status? d. Ethnic background? e. Neighborhood (urban, suburban, rural)? 5. What was the effective date of the study? 6. Can the study be generalized, particularly to the audience in question? It can also be helpful to ask someone familiar with survey research to critique study reports. Many studies funded during recent years have serious procedural flaws which reduce their reliability or leave their credibility suspect. If a study, government report, periodical (e.g., a newspaper or news magazine), book, or speech is to be paraphrased or quoted, a complete bibliographical reference should be available. Members of the audience seldom ask for such references but it is possible that a social service agency represen\u00ad tative, a newsletter writer, or a reporter will hear the presentation and seek additional information. Even if this does not occur, the practice of documenting references is a good insurance measure for the presentor. Public Speaking An educational or informational program usually revolves around a lecturer, speaker, or moderator. Even if a panel is to be used, someone will have to assume the responsibility for coor\u00ad dinating the various presentations. The spoken word is inevitably an important element of any pro\u00ad gram. Occasionally, a crime prevention or community relations officer is fortunate enough to be a \"natural orator.\" More often, however, he is unprepared for the public speaking role which the department .has assigned to him and he must suffer through a number of programs to develop an ac\u00ad ceptable or comfortable speaking style through that old stand-by process: trial and error. Audiences react to the tone or mood set by a speaker. If the speaker is tense and uncomfortable,. then the audience reaction will be similar. If the method of presentation is stiff' and formal, then the audience response will mirror that formality. When conducting a program, therefore, it is good practice never to read a speech. The speaker must be intimately familiar with the su~ject. Then he can use the particular style of delivery which is most comfortable and natural for hIm. Notes help the speaker keep to the general format and flow of the presentation. Refreshing one's memory by looking at notes is acceptable; it also provides an occasional pause i~ the delivery to let the listeners catch up. Scanning the faces in the audience also promotes attentIOn and allows the speaker to take the \"participative pulse\" -to determine if members of the audience understand what he is saying. Active, alert faces, sporadic eye contact with the speaker, and heads titled slightly to the side are feedback which suggest the listeners are indeed attentive. 111-34 1 f --------4_A_j-~_~=_ _______ 4b __ ~\u00b7 . ,.,., .-/ The speaker must recognize that older persons may suffer ff()m restricted peripheral vision. Thus, the best place for him to stand is directly in front of the largest: segment of the audience, preferably on the same level. Room lighting must be on the speaker's face' and not in the eyes of the audience. If the speaker's face is clearly visible, it will facilitate lip-reading and promote concentration. The speaker should talk in a normal tone without shouting or mouthing words and should project his voice to the last row in the audience. Public address systems do not always help when talking to an older audience, since such amplification can cause distortion for people wnth hearing aids.4 Shouting does not help either, since it raises the speaker's pitch, thus making comprehension dif\u00ad ficult for older persons who suffer from a diminished pitch range. Women's voices may pose difficulties for persons suffering from pitch-related hearing difficulties since women!s voices are in the higher end of the range. For women who have high-pitched voices, a good public address system which allows for adjustments to the amplified pitch might be useful to flatten pitch peaks. . A chalkboard or flip chart can be usedl to reinforce what is being said, but explanations of charts or illustrations should be made only wheln facing the audience. Older adults may understand little or nothing of what is being said if the speaker's back is to them. Howev\\~r, when a chalkboard or flip chart is being used, the speaker should remember that chalk or felt-tip pen lines are extremely thin. When they are made on a dark surfac(~ -the chalkboard-or on a glaring surface-a newsprint pad-they will be even more difficult for many older people to read. Gestures and props are useful to illustrate the message the speaker is attempting to deliver. However, they must agree with the sp~)ken word, and they must be timed properly. Also, the speaker must recognize that when he draWS an older person's gaze away from the mouth and toward his hands or a prop, there may be a temporary loss of the verbal message. Many speakers like to hide behind a lectern or a table. This is a common defensive reaction to the stress which always accompanies public st)eaking. The speaker should keep in mind that a lectern emphasizes the different status he has-it says III am the authority here. \" Stepping out. from behind the lectern occasionally helps to establish a feeling of openness; people feel the speaker is relating to them informally. Moving back behind the lectern tends to reestablish control-it is a good maneuver to make when shifting from a, question-and-answer period to a lecture. If a lectern is not available, the speaker must take care not to move around too much. Pacing back and forth in front of an audience of older persons will make it difficult for them to concen\u00ad trate. It will also cause variations in volume level as the speaker moves away from one segment of the audience and then moves back again a few seconds later. Occasional movement a few feet each way will add life to the presentation as long as it is not overdone and as long as the speaker main\u00ad tains eye contaGt with the group. Pace Of The Presentation. An older audience requires a relatively slow delivery pace. Rapid speech, no matter how significant the message, frequently will be unintelligible tiO this group. On the other hand, pacing which is too slow can become boring and cause the.iaudience not to pay attention to the speaker. Careful attention tanon-verbal clues of misunderstanding or boredom will tell the speaker if the pace is comfortable. The pace should suit the audience, not the speaker. :1 ! d i , ' .. i , \\ , Sufficient time must be allowed for audience response, as well as for them to process the informa\u00ad tion being provided. Older adults benefit both from a longer time to hear the presentation and a longer time to respond. Having longer time to respond is of little help if the pace is too rapid.s Memory Cues. Closely related to the pace of the presentation is t?e judicious use of memory cu.es. Older persons do not tend to use memory aids .u~less they ~e mstr~cted to ?O so: Deve.lopmg memory cues to highlight points and to help participants associate the mformatIo? with theIr own life and environment will help to get the point across. Even though two or more tOPICS may not se~m to be obviously related, there may be something which they indirectly have in common to provide the necessary link. One common approach is to form a single word out of key letters (acronym). Each letter of the word serves as a trigger for the full piece of information, and the constant order of the letters serves as a cue for each following piece.6 For example, C.O.P. could be a memory C1JC for a program theme entitled \"Crime and Older Persons.\" When illustrating an important point or giving definitions or directions, the speaker should use oral and written presentations to aid the memory. The chalkboard can be used to spell out the spoken word. Directions or important concepts can also be included in handouts. An older person's memory can be helped if the speaker can rephrase the same idea in different words. Finally, the au\u00ad dience can be encouraged to take notes as another memory cue. VISUAL AIDS Visual aids can reinforce the spoken word and help an older audience remember ideas. It must be remembered, however, that many older persons have difficulty seeing details. Thus, all visual materials must be orally reinforced. Because a person's peripheral vision tends to constrict with age, all visual obj.ec~s, de~ice.s, and materials should be positioned directly in front of audience members-clearly wlthm their field of vision in a well-lighted but non-glare location. Older persons should not be forced to focus their,vision at varying distances w~thin a short time period. For example, instead of lecturing and using the .chalkboard and then refe~rmg to a ha~d-out and returning to the chalkboard to make another pomt, the speaker should fIrSt summanze the hand-out using the chalkboard, then have the group read through the handout together. Often it is helpful to pass visual materials through the audience to allow them a closer look. There a~e six useful rules relating to the decision to use visuals7: 1. When the visuals are to be used in conjunction with oral or other audio materials, they must be directly related to the audio content. Using a visual just to break up the monotony .of ~~e presentation or to impress the audience with the thoroughness of the program plan may mhlblt desired learning. 111-36 . ., ,~ .--~-- ~-----------,-..,....------------' , ' .' I 2. Excessive redundancy between visuals and the spoken portion of the program should be minimized. Visuals should reinforce, not merely repeat. If visuals are used, for example, to list points the speaker wishes to make, he should allow the audience time to read them before com\u00ad menting or rephrasing the projected message. 3. Visual displays should not be punishing. They must be legible,which means they must project clear and bright images. They should not be ambiguous. They should be simple and clean in design. 4. Visuals should not be distasteful to the audience. This is particularly important with older per\u00ad sons who may have different values than the presentor or the community-at-large. Attempts at humor are particularly susceptible to errors in judgment. Analyzing the characteristics of the audience during the program planning phase will go far toward avoiding this problem. 5. It is best to design visuals in a horizontal format. This makes it easier for projected visuals to be seen from the back of the room. The horizontal format also coincides with that used by the entertainment media (television and motion pictures), so people are conditioned to expect it. 6. Color usually adds very little to learning. If it adds to the readibility of the visual, it is ap\u00ad propriate. Otherwise, it can detract from the overall message by leading the viewer toward ir\u00ad relevant thoughts or emotional reactions. When designing visuals, plan on using one foot of screen width for each six feet of viewing distance from the screen. This is known as the 6W formula. 8 It can be tested in the following man\u00adner: Measure in inches the width of the artwork or lettering display to be projected. Divide your answer by two. Hold the artwork or display that many feet away from a viewer and aks him to read the content or to describe the image. If the viewer is successful, your design is adequate for projection. Example: Your artwork is 10 inches wide; divide it by 2 = 5 inches. Have the viewer read the display from a distance of 5 feet.9 The designer should not test read the viSUal. Rather, he should have someone else do it. With an older audience, it might be helpful to have an older citizen-perhaps a department volunteer worker-do the test reading. Films A movie can be an important visual aid in any program-films often supplement instruction and add credibility to the presentation. However, several cautions should be observed when using films. The facts presented in the film must be up-to-date and must be compatible with the intent of the program. If, for example, in.a program for older women, a film is shown which has an actress using karate in self-defense, then the use of this film should be questioned. The aUdience, while viewing 111-37 \u00b7\"'~~-\"tMtll.J . L_IM.1 LIUlldikJl$JEuJi i,I.A\":..liEltklt8,. Sit j , the film, may think that they are expected to resist the offender. The spe~ker actu~lly want~ to deliver the opposite message-older persons who resist an' attacker are hkely to mcur serIOUS physical injuries. When previewing a film to determine its suitability for older persons, the following elements should be evaluated: 1. Narration: Vocal quality should be low-pitched, slow, and relatively loud. The narrator must be enthusiastic and consistent. If, for example, the voice is too soft at a critical point in the plot, the older audience may miss the point. This can be compensated. for by manually turni~g up the volume at that point. It is better to have the spoken words commg from the person~ PIC\u00ad tured-the actors-than from an off-camera narrator. The latter, called \"voice over,\" can be confusing to some older persons. 2. Plot: The film's plot requires good organization. Actors, locations, and props must be clearly visible to those in the rear of the room. If the location or a prop is critical to understanding the film's message, it must be shown long enough for older persons to get the point.. Otherwise, the film will not be very useful. Discussion after the film should highlight critical points that may be missed because of poor cinematography. In some instances, a film can be re-shown to the audience after the discussion. This might be especially useful if it is attempting to teach so\u00ad meone how to do something. 3. Acting: The actors must speak cleariy. They must be identifiable and ~elievable. If, f?r ex~m\u00ad pIe, a con artist is very easily identified by his high pressure salesm~nshlp. st~le, then dlScussl~n should clarify the difficulties in recognizing a con artist in real hfe. It IS Important to aVOld films which resort to \"grade B movie\" stereotypes of criminals. 4. Message: The film's message must be presented in a manner with which an older audience can identify. Its purpose should be to inform as well as to entertain. S. Length. The film should not be longer than 20 minutes to avoid over-reaching the older adult's attention span. Several prevjews may be necessary to fully evaluate a film and devise methods to compensate for flaws if the film is to be used. Posters, hand-out literature, and demonstrations can supplement a movie or fill the informational gaps of the film. Posters . Posters can provide flexibility in a presentation. They can be dry-mounted on hardboard and laminated (dry mounting is an adhesive and heat process; lamination waterproofs the poster). Posters must be large enough to be seen. Loose, individual posters are best. They can be held by the instructor and then passed throughout the audience. Posters should be simple and easy to com\u00ad prehend, with illustrations as \" ' o Hand-Out Literature In terms of volume of use, hand-out literature for older persons is the most frequenHy used visual aid. It C!ln be a record of the program and assist. the older person in remembering what he has learned, or it can be used to further supplement law enforcement goals. Hand-out literature must be factual and concise. An older person should be able to read handout literature at one sitting, or it may not be read. Printing and Layout. If there is no available hand-out literature for programming with older per\u00ad sons, it can be prepared and produced by the law enforcement agency. Four factors to consider are: type, color, paper, and lay-out. The type size, type style and spacing should be selected to facilitate readability. Large lO-to-12 point type size (the size of this text) is generally suitable for older persons. In selecting type style, or type face, the main principle is to avoid extremely stylized or excessively ornate styles. A good type style to choose is described as times roman (it is quite clean with few embellishments on individual letters). In spacing type for older persons to read, the lines should not be tightly set (too close together). Spacing between lines, known as leading, is usually expressed with the size of type-10/12, for ex\u00ad ample, is lO-point type with l2-point leading. Proper print size and style will not be easily readable if there is not sufficient spacing between letters and lines. Color selection requires high contrast without creating a harsh effect on the eye. Black letters on white backgrounds, although not unacceptable, are not the best choices for hand-outs for older per\u00ad sons. Generally, a soft-white, eggshell, or buff-colored paper provides sufficient contrast for the older reader without creating a harsh effect. Dark color prints on pale backgrounds are generaily good, while bright pastels, although eye-catching, are harsh. It is also best to avoid light print on dark b~ckgrounds. 1n selecting two high-contrast colors for hand-out liter.ature, avoid red-green combinations which 'cannot be distinguished by color blind individuals (of any age). Avoid paper types that reflect light, such as glossy finish ma,gazine paper stock. The matte finish papers are all g~nerally very good, and they need not be expensiv~. Headings, text, and iliustnitions should have si~iple lay-outs. Any illustrations, such as line draw\u00ad ings, should not insult older persons by strong stereotyping. Hand-out literature should b~ designed to be simple, of high-contrast, and to the point. Demonstrations Older persons can actively participate in the program by taking part in demonstrations or in role\u00ad playing skits. For example, an older woman can be asked to carry her purse. While she is in front of the audience, proper methods of carrying the purse to deter purse snatching can be also walk through the audience so that everyone can see clearly the proper procedure. Use of whistles and lock displays are other examples where the audience can actually participate in learn\u00ad ing how to use these devices. CREATING A POSITIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT Presentation skills alone, no matter how effective, will not guarantee good informational or educational programming for an older audience. The older persons themselves must be motivated to absorb the informalion into their lives. While the program's presentor cannot motivate everyone, he can do certain things to create a positive learning environment which will enable members of the audience to identify their own motivations in terms of the program's content. Such an environment enhances individual motivation by being supportive, allowing audience participatiCin, providing meaningful content, and showing a personal commitment to the cause.~' /' Supportive Environment Most older adults experience some anxiety in a learning situation. This anxiety may be reflected in passivity, hostility, or refusal to interact. Conversely, it may result in excessive demands for interac\u00ad tion. Being in a peer group rather than an audience with different age levels will be more comfortable for the older person. 10 Having an opportunity to get acquainted before the program might also help. The presentor can aid this process by spending a few minutes asking for audience characteristics, either by a show of hands or by asking persons to volunteer to speak. A supportive environment is a comfortable environment. The speaker should avoid being too for\u00ad mal. Chatting with members of the audience before the presentation begins and during intermission will help. It may also be useful to learn a few names and to use them during the presentation to es\u00ad tablish a feeling of rapport. Participation An older audience generally will include men and women from diversified social, economic, racial, and cultural backgrounds. Their interests will be as varied as their total life experiences. When they attend a program, they bring with them a fund of rich prior experience and can become quite frustrated when this experience seems of little value in the program. This experience can be tapped and audience participation encouraged by positively reacting to audienc~questions and comments, saying such things as, \"That is a good question, because ... \" or \"That is an interesting comment, because ... \" When presenting a program for an. older audience, it is a good general rule never to ignore a question or comment from the audience, no mat\u00ad ter how insignificant it may seem. Each individual's contribution to the program should be accepted and dealt with. 111-40 \\ I ~ . . Audience participation can be encouraged by the program presentor in a variety of ways:ll Request definitions from the group. Make certain obscure words or phrases are defined. Avoid jargon except where it is a necessary part of the instruction. Do ~ot do all the talking. Encourage the group to verbalize concepts~ Rather than continually statmg facts, attempt to get persons in the audience to verbalize the facts by presenting cases and examples; help the audience draw conclusions. Listening is a valuable tool for both speaker and listener alike. Foster self-discovery. Rather than doing their thinking for them, encourage individuals to par\u00ad ticipate in the learning situation. Illustrate c~ncepts by sharing personal experiences that can serve as examples of the ideas you are attemptmg to teach. Request examples of similar experiences from the older audience. When using specific examples of traumatic events, the speaker should exercise caution. If some\u00ad one in the audience has recently been similarly victimized, he may experi~nce a \"flashback\" reac\u00ad tion, causing a recurrence of the psychological side effects of the incident. The speaker should be sensitive to audience reactions to illustrative stories. These techniques will not only encourage audience participation-they will also help create a more supportive environment for learning, especially for older persons. Meaningful Content To stimulate a desire for participation, information must be meaningful. Ideas and thoughts must be rel\",ted to an older person's personal experiences or to events familiar to that group. Analysis of the audience and of their crime and service problems during the program planning phase will begin to tell the presentor what meaningful topics can be discussed. These topics can be planned beforehand, and they can be modified as necessary during the program. What may seem important to a law enforcement officer may be of little or no concern to an older' person. Program content must be directed toward meeting the needs and concerns of the audience, not the program sponsors. . Personal Commitment . Althoug~ it is ve~y difficult to describe, a ;significant factor in establishing a positive learning en\u00ad VIronment IS behaVIor on the Pl,ut of the presentor which shows that he cares about the audience and its problems. Older persons recognize their vulnerability. They know they are frequently victimized. When they are going to be told even more explicitly that they are vulnerable, they want to hear it from someone who cares about that fact. Otherwise, as the old saw goes, it \"adds insult to injury.\" It is easy for a law enforcement officer to become hardened to the harsh realities of life even to the victimization of virtually helpless members of society. This hardness develops partly fdr the of- personal psychological survival. It allows him to keep working without sinking pnder the weight of frustration, depression, and rage that otherwise develops. ' When dealing with the older population to enhance their survival skills, the law enforcement pro-' gram speaker must not let his cynicism show through. On the contrary, a positive attitude and de\u00ad meanor are necessary, for they will give hope to the older person who is seeking an indication that help is truly available. . CONCLUSION Effective programming for older persons requires a commitment to do necessary research, to develop a program plan, to sharpen presentation skills, and to work closely and sensitively with that target group. None of these points individually will be sufficient to ensure program success. When coordinated in a comprehensive program development and delivery process, however, they go far toward providing meaningful service to a significant part of the community. SUMMARY Programs with lectures and films jollowed by discussion or question-and-answer periods are well\u00ad suited to older audiences; however, proper planning by the program speaker is absolutely essential. A plan serves as a road map-it does not have to be followed point-by-point. Essential to the planning process is specifically identifying who the members of the audience are. The program plan\u00ad ner must ask a series of key questions to focus in on the audience since a successful program says something the people in the audience need to hear. The program planner, to be effective, needs to know what to say, why to say it, where to say it, and how to say it. A variety oj presentation skills contribute to the success oj an injormational or educational pro\u00ad gram jor older persons. I;' I These skills include research, public speaking,. pacing, providing memory cues, and using visual aids effectively. Many crime prevention officers fall into the trap of thinking that because they have presented one, two, or even dozens of programs that they can go into a new one and \"wing it.\" When they do this, they risk providing a disservice to the participants, who regard the law enforce\u00ad ment speakers as a representative of a critical~ lifeline service. Professional performance requires cultivation of presentation skills. 111-42 . , ~:t f I v .-\" REFERENCES 1. ~t;:;~en~e E. Vickery, Creative Programmingfor Older Adults.

However, there may be times when non-reporters may be interested in information. For example, disk jockeys, high school newspaper writers, talk show hosts, or neighborhood newsletter publishers may occasionally want information about the law en\u00ad forcement problems of older citizens. Thus, the agency's policy must be broad enough to include such non-traditional news seekers as recipients of program information and news releases. What? Eacq law enforcement agency prohibits its employees from releasing certain kinds of in\u00ad formation, such as the names of juv~niles who have been arrested, the identity of suspects prior to arrest unless a warrant has been issued, the existence or content of admissions or confessions, the identities of prospective witnesses, the names of victims of sexual offenses (both males and females) and other information which would not normally be available through reports open to inspection under the various \"freedom of information\" acts. These policies vary from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The release of some types of information (such as the names of juvenile offenders) is specifically prol;libited by law in many states while the release of other types of infor\u00ad mation is left to the discretionary judgment of each law enforcement agency. For example, most law enforcement agencies will not release the names of victims of sexual offenses. Others will not list the names and specific addresses of burglary victims. Law enforcement agencies might want to consider prohibiting personnel from releasing specific information about elderly crime victims, such as exact addresses. However, such a policy would have to involve cooperation by local news outlets since there may be little or no legal basis for withholding such information. ' Information provided to media outlets through news releases or news conferences must conform to these guidelines. In most cases, such department-generated information does not include sensitive details. Rather, it focuses on subjects of general interest or concern. Thus the major consideration for the officer working with older persons is to establish an un~erstanding with his supervisors con\u00ad cerning the types 1)f news releases he can issue directly as a function of his assignment. Coordination with the central media relations officer, if the department has one,.must be maintained. Usually that person will refer inquiries about older persons to the program director, since reporters always ask to talk to the department's \"expe~t\" on specific subjects. When and Where? There are basically two kinds of information required by reporters: that in\u00ad volving a developing news story and that which is feature information. \"Developing news\" refers to events that are unfolding at the time of the reporter's inquiry. Examples are crimes that have just oc\u00ad curred or investigations that are under way. Usually, the director. of programm'ing for older 'persons will not be involved in providing such \"hot\" news. Even if a 'crime involves an elderly victim or perpetrator, it is probably best to let the media relations office! handle inquiries. However, the director of the program for older persons should be willing to assist with providing specific details if necessary. For example, if an 80-year-old man was arrested for shoplifting in a grocery store, reporters might want to know if this is a com\u00ad mon problem among elderly residents in the community; with such a question, t\\1e media relations officer might ask the director of programs for the elderly to provide' statistical information to reporters. 111-47 , Feature information usually includes stories that are less time-specific and provide more in,ter\u00ad pretive content than do \"straight\" news stories. Such information is u~iquelY su~ted for dissemm~\u00ad tion by the director of programs for the elderly, since he is the substantIve e~pert 10 the age?cy. ThIS type of information may be provided in advance through a news. release or,It ma! be provIded dur\u00ad ing an activity, such as a seminar or conference, through ~he m~dlUm of an mtervIew. It also may be provided after-the-fact through either a news release or mtervlew. It is a good rule to provide information sufficiently in advance of a planned event to ensure that it is received in time to be used by the targeted media outlets. This requires knowing press-run or broadcast deadlines of the affected outlets. It also requires knowing where to deliver the informa\u00ad tion and the proper format for the information. If the program director finds himself in the position of providing in.formation about a sensitive issue he should make every effort to be responsive to questions without being \"put on the spot.\" One ~uthority on media relations suggests keeping several \"do's and don'ts\" in mind during a crisis situation.2 MEDIA RELATIONS IN CRISIS SITUATIONS DO: -get exact question wording -give the facts -answer \"what are you going to do?\" -show concern for the public -treat accusers as sincere, but uninformed -respect deadlines-return every call -keep your cool -advise employees and promptly DON'T: -go off the record -guess -lie -use complicated sentence structure -say more than you intend ~answer what you don't understand -lose your temper -be funny or sarcastic -go \"No , ~. \" . The department's program director for the elderly should also be aware of the setting in which in\u00ad formation is provided. Spot news information frequently is provided by officers at the scene of a crime or other emergencies; at an on-the-scene event, the person providing the information to the media usually cannot select his setting and background. However, it is important to be aware of such things, especially when dealing with television crews. When there is an opportunity to control the setting for TV interviews, the officer should try to select a site which is uncluttered and which contributes as much as possible to the tone he wishes to convey as part of the overall message. Why and How? Timely information should be provided to news media emtlets because it is to the law enforcement agency's advantage to do so. A wellplanned and orchestrated flow of information conveys an image of concern and responsiveness. It also helps to establish the context within which subsequent news stories will be cast by reporters. It allows the deiPartment to tell its story. And, it establishes and helps to nourish productive relationships between members of the department and representatives of the media. The goals and objectives of the public information component of the program conducted for older persons should be carefully considered. They will help to guide subsequent activities and will contribute to the success of the overall program. Contacts with media representatives will be both formal and informal. Formal contacts include news releases, news conferences, structured announcements, and responses to media inquiries. In\u00ad formal contacts include social visits (e.g., lunches), occasional calls to \"keep in touch,\" provision of background information, and recognition of reporters' contributions to program success through telephonic, written, or personal messages of thanks. Conclusions. Each of the preceding elements should be considered as the agency develops its policy regarding relations with news media. Each of these elements has significance in the broader context of overall department operations. In addition, each element also has specific signifi,':ance for specialized programs to serve older citizens. One major concern of each law enforcement agency must be the coordination of its media rela\u00ad tions efforts, particularly if these responsibilities are to be shared by various department units. One mechanical method for maintaining control involves the use of a Media Contact and Activity Report, sqch as that illustrated in Figure One., Each department member who deals with reporters should cf,)~hplete this form weekly or monthly. When submitted to the central public information unit, the 'C!lmulative picture is useful in outlining the totality of the agency's media contact program. Terms And Definitions It is important to establish a precise vocabulary to describe the department's efforts in dealing with older persons. There can be various definitions of \"older,\" \"elderly,\" \"aged,\" and \"senior citizen.\" It is to the agency's advantage to select the term preferred by the community it serves and to define that term for use by all members of the department. The definition should specify the age range included. 111-49 \\ I, It is also important to sensitize members of the department to the need for using standard ter\u00ad minology and for avoiding the use of words or phrases which negatively stereotype the target population. For example, the use of the word \"senile\" is generally discouraged as being too im\u00ad pr~cise and too negatively loaded to convey a useful message to the public. Sharing the department's approved vocabulary with representatives of the media will accomplish three purposes. First, it will provide insight on the department's thoroughness. Second, it will ensure common understanding. Third, it will provide insight to the department's philosophical stance toward older persons. KNOW THE MEDIA It is Ul'lfortunate that many law enforcement officers and administrators have a vague, poorly defined mental picture of \"the media.\" An effective system of media contacts requires knowing what the media outlets are, where they are, and who represents them. The person responsible for programming for older persons must analyze the media network in his community. This will ensure sufficient working knowledge, not only to further departmental goals, but also to respond to the media's need for information. Depending upon locale and demographics, developing an accurate picture of the media network may be easy or complex. In either case, certain information is required. Identify The Outlets There are variety of media outlets in almost any community. The most obvious are those that are most visible in everyday life. They typically include the major newspapers and broadcast stations serving the area. Depending upon the population and degree of urbanization, thertewspaper group\u00ad ing may include a local or regional daily, a local or regional weekly, neighborhood newspapers, and \"shoppers\" or \"throwaways\" delivered through pick-Up distribution points or door-to-door. The broadcast media include local or regional television and radio outlets. Sometimes these are locally owned and programmed. In other cases, they are affiliated with chains or networks and many programming decisions are dictated for them. Regional magazines are enjoying increasing popularity. They tend to focus on issues of concern to local residents, frequently from a promotional point of view. Their audience is typically the younger, more affluent person with a significant disposable income. However, this fact should not preclude efforts to reach them with information and stories. But it does require that articles be writ\u00ad ten in a way which appeals to the magazine's target group. There are also many specialized magazines devoted to audiences which have something in com\u00ad mon, e.g., those who enjoy a particular sport or share a hobby, those of a particular ethnic heritage, or those in a particular age bracket. These magazines may be published at some distance from the local community. However, they might be interested in a locally generated story if they feel it has general applicability or if there is a significant subscriber population in the area. III-50 , . , ? is the \"grass roots\" media comprised of club, church, association, and nelghborho?d newsl~tters. :hese. publications have restricted distribution, but they are usually ~un~~y for mfor\";1atIOn to fIll theIr columns. They are also read avidly by subscribers, so there is slgmflcant potentIal for getting the message across. Develop A Media Profile ~t can ~e useful t~ construct a media profile to aid in determining the distribution of information. Thl~ profl~~ s~ould mclude the name of the publication or broadcast outlet, its pUblication frequen\u00ad cy, Its af~dlatlon (owners, network relationships, etc.), the circulation or coverage in numbers and geographIcally, publication or air deadlines for various types of stories, names of relevant editions and.reporters, address, telephone numbers, and any special consideration, e.g., preferred types of stones. S,ome of, the. infor~a!ion, ~~quired in developing a media profile may be obtained from The Ayer's GUide, ~hlch I,S the bIble I~ the ~ublic relations profession. Other information may be gathered throug~ I?tervle~s or a questIonnrure, depending upon the number of outlets involved. Once col\u00ad lected, It IS also Important to keep all of the information up-to-date. T~e profile can be ~s~d to. prepare ~ distri?ution list. This need only be a one-page form with the medIa outlet and speCIfIC edItor or wnter prmted on it. It should provide space to log the name or number of a news release and the date of its mailing or delivery to the outlet. Such a control device is useful in keeping track of information flow and in checking one's \"track record.\" MEDIA CULTIVATION In ~ost law enforcement agencies, the officer responsible for programming for older persons has had l~ttle or ~o experience in working with the media. The suggestion that this person should assume a ~aJor role m such dealings will elicit varying reactions, usually of apprehension or outright dread. ThIS need not. be the case, h?wever, because as the substantive expert, the program director possess~s the VItal element reqUIred of every effective media relationship-accurate information on the subject at hand. All that is required to establish a good working relationship with reporters is to structure the delivery of that information. When the department has a designated public information officer (PIO), the program director for older persons can ~ollow ~he PIO's lead, deferring to his authority and to established policy and pro\u00ad c~dure when questIOns arISe. ~~e.n there ~s no centrally identified information officer, the program dl.rector has a broader responSIbIlIty. In eIther case, however, the primary function and that which WIll consume most of his media time, is to \"cultivate\" the media. ' Much as the term implies, media cultivation involves efforts to create conditions under which media outlets will be positive in their coverage of the department. Even if a media outlet is critical of th~ department in some way, effective cultivation efforts can contribute to keeping that coverage obJectIve. III-51 \\\\ \\ lJ \\ , Media cultivation is an on-going process. It includes such simple practices as being available to reporters, returning telephone calls promptly, and providing occasional updates on activities. It need not be elaborate, but it must be continuous. There are six key elements to the process: Be accessible. Provide background information-make the reporter look good. Initiate information flow. Generate ideas. Set the context. . Follow through. Accessibility requires more than aJ.'lswering the telephone. It starts with making a commitment to news people to answer questions in a reasonable and timely fashion. It includes setting ground r.ules so that all parties recognize that some questions cannot be answered, ~d that w~len such qu~s!lons arise the officer will tell the reporter that such is the case. It further reqUires occasionally provldmg a bit more information than has been requested. One of the major payoffs for being accessible to the media is that the process is reciprocal. A good reporter, much as a good law enforcement. officer, .nurt~res his in~o.rmation sources. R~asonable ef\u00ad fort expended in developing a good workmg relatIOnship pays diVidends to both parties. Providing background on department activitieS-In the case at hand on programs for older per\u00ad sons-serves at least two objectives. First, it helps to promulgate the agency's message. Second, and perhaps more importantly, it helps to make the reporter look good. A. reporter w~o has a firm grasp of the fundamentals of a problem will develop a better story, more qUickly, and With less effort than would otherwise be required. This makes him look good, both to his supervisors and to the listerners to a broadcast or the readers of a newspaper. The result should be a degree of gratitude to the sources. who contribute.d to the successful news gathering effort. Background information starts with a basic \"media kit\" on the target topic. It might i.nc!ude. a summary statement of the problem, an overview (,I)f the department, background stat~stlcs, il\u00ad lustrative examples of the problem and of the department's response, and the names of key mforma\u00ad tion resources, both within and outside the department. This can be updated occasionally a~ new statistics become available or as the director of the program for older persons encounters new mfor\u00ad mation or initiates new activities. Providing background information leads logically to initiating an~ ,:,ainta~ning a flow of !nfor\u00ad mation from the department outward. Being a regular source of lfilormatlOn keeps one m the reporter's mind. Every news organization has \"slow news days\" when they have extra column space or air time available. Editors and news directors will fill such space with information at hand. Why not something about how the local law enforcement agency is working to help older citizens in the community? It can be helpful to create a \"tkkler\" file, perhaps by month, in which to dr?p items that mig~t later prove useful or interesting. In the early winter months, for example, remmd the local media about the dangers of hypothermia to older persons. In the spring, a note about the probable upsurge in home repair frauds might be interesting. III-52 ? I , .- .. \" ---------.:-~:....:.....:...---------------~--- ..... ,.\"----- ._--J) , ' / Generating ideas in this way can occasionally be discouraging-they will frequently not be used-but in the long run it usually pays off. A quick telephone call to a reporter to pass along in\u00ad formation about a study one has recently read or about a case that appears to have some human in\u00ad terest appeal might be received at just the right time to get in the next edition or on the next newscast. It is also a good practice to develop feature story ideas. A short outline with photo suggestions can be filed by the local media outlet for development at a more opportune time. Even if the ideas are not used in their original form, they wiil contribute to the reporter's overall understanding of the problem and the department's efforts to deal with it. Internally written news releases will frequently suffer the same fate as generalized story ideas. News releases are most likely to be used by smaller, less frequently published newspapers that have small news staffs. It is still productive for the agency to disseminate news releases, however, because even if they are not published as written they may spark enough interest for an editor to assign a reporter to follow up. An almost inevitable result of these several media cultivation practices will be to set the context within which the news outlet deals with the crime and service problems of older persons. When a reporter is completely unfamiliar with a story topic, he will cast about for a \"peg\" on which to hang a story. The' 'peg\" will emerge from interviews with various sources and reviews of available written material. A successful cultivation effort will make such searching less necessary. The more prior awareness the reporter has, the more likely it is that he will develop the story to somehow reflect that point of view. An addendum to each of these cultivation activities must be tofollow through. Follow through on inquiries; follow through on story ideas; follow through even if the contact was initiated by the other person. It should not be over done, but a note or telephone call thanking a reporter, providing another item of information, or commenting favorably on a story is almost always in order and ap\u00ad preciated. One could easily identify other practices which might help in cultivating the media. In a sense, however, mechanical steps are less important than is having a philosophy which recognizes the value of positive media relationships. When such a philosophy is actualized through the several activities described, the payoff to the law enforcement agency can be significant. INTERNALLY PREPARED NEWS RELEASES: DOING IT YOURSELF Sometimes the best way to get a story told is to tell it yourself. That requires a rudimentary knowledge of how to prepare a news release. If the message is aimed at broadcast media, a public service announcement (PSA) may be used. And, if the need is to publicize a special event, such as a conference or speech, coordinative activities must be added to the repertoire.

Preparing The News Release One does not just write a news release. Stringing the thoughts together is only part of the process; first, \u00b7it is necessary to understand how to prepare a news release so that it has the greatest chance of being used. This involves understanding style, structure, and format. Style. All news outle~s mandate a particular writing style, which includes rules governing gram\u00ad mar, spelling, abbreviations, and punctuation. One of the most common formats used by many media outlets is that of the Associated Press; their stylebook is readily available from book dealers. If there is a dominant newspaper in the area, the department may wish to use their preferred style. Regardless of the style adopted, it is important that the department include rules to cover terms and definitions adopted locally as a matter of policy. Adherence to the stylebook should be man\u00ad datory. Structure. News releases usually are written according to a structural skeleton known as the \"in\u00ad verted pyramid. \" This means that the most significant facts are presented early, at the beginning, or \"top\" of the story. Less significant information, which serves primarily to elaborate on the basics, is placed in subsequent paragraphs. This structure aids the reader by giving the most important points first. Then he may decide Whether to read further. It also serves the editor, who can easily cut material from the end of the story to keep it within space limitations. Usually, the most important facts involve who the story is about or What is is about. Less impor\u00ad tant is the why, and less important yet are the when, where, and how. There are obvious exceptions to these rules. The writer must determine what he believes are the most important story elements and lead with them. Figure Two provides an example of a routine news release written in the \"inverted pyramid\" structure. ' Format. News copy should adhere to a standard format. It shQuld be typed, double-spaced, with paragraphs indented five spaces. Margins should be wide. Words should not be divided between lines and paragraphs should not carry from one page to the next. If there is more than one page, the word \"more\" should be typed at the bottom of each page except the last. Either the symbol \"-30_\" or an acronym such as cc-CPD_\" (for City Police Department), should be typed, centered, at the end of the story. All releases should have the name of the writer or principal contact person typed at the end of the narrative. Pages should be firmly fastened together at the top left corner. Public Service Announcements Radio and television stations must provide free air time to public and non-profit agencies; this re\u00ad quirement is mandated by the Federal Communications Commission as part of the broadcast outlet's licensing procedure. When the license comes up for renewal, the station must demonstrate to the FCC that it provided a specific amount of free air time for public service announcements. III-54 ------~----------,-, ------\"\"'''''=-'''''-''''''''''=.~' 1 f . . \\ / .-A good design for a publiC service announcement uses the acronym AIDA: A-attention; grab the listener or viewer. 1-interest; promise a benefit; how will the listener or viewer gain? D-desire; make the listener or viewer want to do something. A-action; tell the listener or viewer what to do. The information must be specific enough to get key ideas across. It must maintain interest from beginning to end. It can be done in script form for the radio or television station to use, or it can be done on tape. As a rule, however, remember that:\" A lO-second spot has approximately 20 words. A 20-second spot has approximately 50 words. A 30-second spot has approximately 75 words. A 60-second spot has approximately 150 words. A television PSA usually will require either slides or video tape for the visual element. These can be expensive to develop. If the agency is interested in a television spot, it is advisable to seek expert assistance, either from the television outlet, from an independent consultant or advertising agency, or from a local college or university. Special Events Occasionally, the department's program director for older persons will need to promote a special event. A conference, a seminar, or a crime prevention fair can involve many people and generate the need to accommodate\u00b7 a variety of news reporters, camera crews, and photographers. The University of Southern California's News Service outlines several steps required to help ensure a successful media relations component to a special event. 3 Everything that can be done in advance, should be done in advance. The day of the event will go most smoothly if advance arrangements have been properly made. Prepared Information. A media kit is in order. It can be a simple manila folder, or something more elaborate, but it should contain certain background information. Fact sheet -event name -sponsor(s) -goals/purposes of the event -origin of the event -number of participants -participant breakdown; job, organization, etc. -PR person to contact for follow-up -media workroom location -nearest \\1 I ,I ;i ,. . Map of location, parking, buildings Event schedul . :. ' Biographical Summaries; a paragraph oJ? each speaker or panelist Question-and-Answer sheet regarding the event topic Advance copies of speeches Logistical Support. A variety of activities will make the media representative's job easier. They will also make the sponsor's job easier by minimizing potential last-minute problems. A media information table is helpful if a significant number of reporters is expected. It serves as a starting point and a reference and information center. It should open at least one-h~~ ~our before registration for the event starts. Staff should be well-versed on program plans and actlVltles. At least two knowledgeable persons and two runners should be on hand. The table should never be unat\u00ad tended. Persons working at the media information table should meet before the program to ensure that they understand the mechanics of the conference and their own responsib~lities .. The t~ble should be well marked. Staff should have easily readable nametags. All medIa representatIves should also have nametags identifying them as \"MEDIA\" and giving their names and organiia- tional affiliations. Staff should maintain a telephone, directories, a media sign-in sheet, a supply of media kits, and staff business cards. Media Workroom. A reserved work area with telephones, tables, chairs, and, if pos.si~l~, typewriters can be a boon to reporters. They also will appreciate coffee or other refreshments If It IS possible to provide them. Electronic Media. Radio and television reporters and crews have some special requirements. A connection box that allows taping from the public address system is useful. Television cameras will benefit from bright stage lights. If individual interviews are to be conducted by television reporters, set aside a spot that displays the conference or department logo in the background. Also ensure th~t there are sufficient electrical outlets and maneuvering room for camera crews and sound techm- cians. Arranging Interviews. Frequently a reporter will not know who to interview. The ~edi~ coor\u00ad dinator of the event should be able to suggest people and topics. It can be embarrassmg If staff members cannot easily recognize speakers or panelists. Try to have photographs of those persons available or identify participants or other staff members who can point them out. Be sure that speakers and panelists are aware they might be signaled out for individual interviews so that they are not surprised. III-56 / CONCLUSION Positive relationships between the law enforcement agency and the news media will do much to enhance the effectiveness of programs to serve older citizens. The extent and sophistication of the media relations program mounted by department programmers will vary. Seldom will efforts such as those described in this lesson fail to yield benefits, however. Careful attention to the flow of in\u00ad formation to news outlets can help to reach more people and generate a broader support base than is otherwise possible. SUMMARY The department's program for older persons can derive numerous benefits if the department has established an effective working relationship with local media outlets. . . Media relations activities can be beneficial to the director of the department's programs for older persons. Such activities enhance the department's ability to communicate with the target group, heighten the awareness of the entire community to the problems of older persons, and improve the department's image. Police personnel are prohibited from releasing certain types of information, either by the agency itself or by state statutes. The media has a legal right to receive certain types of information from law enforcement agencies. However, departmental policies may prohibit the release of specific types of information, such as the names of victims of sexual assaults. In addition, some states prohibit, by statute, the release of specific types of information, such as the names of juvenile offenders. Each department must develop a media relations policy statement which spells out the types of information which can and cannot be released to the media. It might be advisable to develop a policy to withhold certain infor\u00ad mation about older victims, such as exact addresses, in order to help prevent further victimization. The director of the program for older persons should serve as the department's spokesman for in\u00ad formation about crime problems involving the elderly; however, he should coordinate his activities with the department's public information officer or media spokesman. The director of the program for older persons should become proficient in media relations techni\u00ad ques. This involves: knowing who the media representatives are; developing an on-going working relationship with them; understanding what types of information they need; and learning how to prepare news releases and public service announcements, conduct news conferences, and plan for media coverage at special events.

I LESSON ONE OLDER PERSONS AS VOLUNTEERS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT This lesson examines the involvement of older volunteers in law enforcement and considers ways that older volunteers can add new dimensions to a law enforcement agency by providing support ser\u00ad vices. HISTORY From the earliest civilized times, police agencies have been aided by civilian volunteers. For exam\u00ad ple, in the mid-1200s Henry III of England asked householders to volunteer to help the head con- stable keep the peace. /. I,' Centuries later the spirit of providing wihelping hand to neighbors was carried by settlers to the New World. The willingness of these pioneers to help each other survive became a way of life in America because of the dangers and perils which existed: neighbors had to help each other or all might perish. Various academicians attribute the belief in volunteerism in America to the pioneer's religious sense of responsibility to his fellow man, enhanced and made more immediate by the prob\u00ad lems of life in a harsh and strange land. Established religious institutions took the lead in assuming responsibility for works of mercy and for the management of organized groups of volunteer members. Even today, the churches of America sponsor the greatest number of volunteer groups, followed by hospitals, fire departments, and law enforcement agencies. After the Revolutionary War, groups of immigrants formed volunteer societies in order to aid newcomers of the same ethnic background. Later in the 18th century, organizations were formed to combat specific social problems, s~ch as providing food to the needy, rather than to give aid solely to persons from one country or from one religion. The frontiers could not have been settled without the help of citizen-neighbors who banded together to raise barns, build schools and homes, and protect each other from attacks by criminals. With the advent of the Industrial'Revolution, the leaders of American communities began to realize that they needed to develop programs which would combat the pr9blems generated by a new social order. Families, communities, and society as a whole were facing stresses brought about by the process of industrialization and urbanization. Because of an increase in social disorder, the need for professional police services became apparent. Thus, by the 1870s every major city in the United States had a fulltime paid police force. 1 With the development and acceptance of these departments, the citizen volunteer was no longer needed. The concept of volunteering for police duty gradually disappeared, both in the United States and abroad.2 IV-1 I During the Depression there was a large increase in the number of volunteer organizations, although law enforcement agencies generally were hesitant to use untrained civilians for police work. However, World War II created severe manpower shortages and greatly increased civil defense requirements. The reserve/auxiliary volunteer concept developed and grew during this period as a partial alternative to the personnel shortages of law enforcement agencies. These units were trained primarily for civil defense work, but many police departments established courses to teach the volunteers basic police procedures. During the later years of the war when the threat of enemy attack upon the United States diminished, many volunteer police units disbanded. However, the Korean conflict soon created new demands on the male work force, resulting in the revival or reorganization of a number of these units. Law enforcement agencies have been training civilian volunteers both for enforcement and non-enforcement duties since that period. To a great extent, volunteers have become a permanent part of the agencies which utilize them. In recent years the number of criminal justice agencies which use volunteers has increased and these volunteers have been given broader responsibilities.3 It has been estimated that there are over 500,000 voluntary associations in the United States today, including 100,000 voluntary health and welfare agencies; 100,000 fraternal, civil, veterans and related organizations; and over 300,000 churches which offer some kind of health and welfare services.4 Even though there are over 500,000 volunteer organizations in existence, there is a need in society for additional assistance from non-paid workers. The demand for trained volunteers in law enforce\u00ad ment programs, for example, far exceeds the available personnel. Police officials realize the value of the assistance they obtain from crime prevention advisory committee members who serve without remuneration, the professional person who provides expertise and advice at no charge to the tax\u00ad payers, and the volunteers whose talents are utilized in every possible way. The untrained volunteer can be trained in formal classes and on-the-job by professional police of\u00ad ficers. Once they are properly trained, volunteers can contribute many needed skills to improve the effectiveness of the community's law ~nforcement programs. These volunteer programs stress participation and a partnership between the private and public efforts needed for effective law enforcement. Volunteerism, in the sense of citizen participation and involvement, cannot be limited to the traditional, long established, so-called \"power structure\" of the communities. It must include leadership and fellowship across the whole community.s The recent public initiatives for lower taxes and improved productivity from public agencies leave little doubt that law enforcement agencies will, in the future, need to rely heavily upon volunteers, especially for crime prevention duties. One source of volunteers that has barely been tapped, at least in law enforcement, is that of the senior citizen. The old adage that \"a person who retires from a job has not retired from life\" has been proven true often by those law enforcement administrators who have augmented their shrink\u00ad ing budgets with the labor of older volunteers. Law enforcement administrators are keenly aware that 80-85 percent of their total budgets are for the salaries of personnel. When portions of that money can be redirected because of volunteer labor, then, hopefully, the agency can increase its effi\u00ad ciency. The two primary functions of police officers are enforcement of laws and providing general IV-2 1 I . , \" , - ./ community safety service~. Man~ have demonstrated that enforcement activitief) require only a?out one-fourth the polIce officer s -tIme; community service activities occupy the larger share of hiS workday. Many service deli~ery functions can be assumed by civilian volunteers, freeing the police officers for enforcement dutIes. In a~~~tion, it appears that many municipal and county governments are turning down requests for additIonal s~orn personnel and that some jurisdictions are cutting existing positions due to ~udgetar~ restraInts. Many govern,ments would prefer to pay highly trained professional police of\u00ad flcer~ a hlgh.er wag~ to perform theIr enforcement activities if older volunteers are available for com\u00admumty servICe duties. LAW ENFORCEMENT INTEREST IN OLDER VOLUNTEERS The willingness of o!der volunteers to provide public services is attracting the attention of many la~ enforcement agencies across the country. The demands and needs for police services are growing whI1~ ~he.~eso~u~:es to m;et th~se demands an~ need1f are budgets are forcing police admInlstr atOtii to fl~d alternative ways to delrvt!lf $crvices normally provided by highly skilled law enf?rcement prOfeSSl?nals. Because of shrinking budgets, police executives are transferring various duties to paraprofeSSionals and volunteers. Older persons as a group have been identified as a valuable resource to meet the need for v?lunteers. They provide many benefits to a law enforcement agency and can augment current ser\u00ad VICf~S to enable the department to meet service delivery needs. Since older volunteers provide assls~ance at a ,lOW cost, budgeted departmental funds which would have been used to pay the salarIes of fulltlme employees can instead be allocated to vital service delivery areas. Fro~ a mana~ement p~rspective, volunteers provide many benefits to a police department. Inter\u00ad ~al polIce operatIons are Improved as sworn personnel are freed from low priority and time consum\u00ad mg tasks and allowed to concentrate their professional efforts on \"police work.\" Fulltime employees are able to make fuller use of their technical skills and training. Thus, professionalism in,. creases, both for the department and for each officer. With improved service delivery by law enforcement officers and volunteers the public image of the police department is enhanced. When a law enforcement agency opens the door to volunteers it als~ opens th~ door to the com~lUn~ty. M,any volunteer programs, as part of their activities, help ;x\u00ad plal~ th~ polIce role and functIon In society to the service population. Volunteers open new com- mumcatIon channels between the community and the department. . When ~ police dep~rtment d,elegates mean~ngful duties and responsibilities to the volunteers, the commumty beco?Ies m~olved In the p~eventlOn of crime and takes a greater interest in supporting the work of polIce officers. The polIce department gains stature as community members look to~ard law enforcement officers and administrators as community leaders. Public confidence in the polIce department and in local government as a whole grows. IV-3 .' \\' t ~'. .., , ' \", \" J I .'. There is another benefit which is often overlooked. When volunteers increase community involve\u00ad ment in law enforcement activities, the political support for the department increases as well. With increased political support, may come such attendant benefits as salary incr,eases for police employees, funds to purchase needed equipment, and so forth. Volunteer programs can also be viable tools for effecting change in the community and represen\u00ad ting departmental concerns for the quality of police service delivery. Inevitably, volunteerism can improve the proficiency of the entire criminal justice syste)m. More crimes will be reported. Communities also find that more criminals are apprehended and prosecuted as a result of the alertness of law enforcement volunteers. Law enforcement agencies assisted by volunteers can reduce crime. Every law enforcement professional, from the line patrol officer to the chief, can benefit from the experience and expertise of the community's residents, who may be will\u00ad ing to serve as volunteers. Through a volunteer program, the officer can increase his effectiveness in dealing with both the community and the department. Volunteers provide the officer with greater flexibility to meet his law enforcement duties and responsibilities-the officer can focus on tasks which require his special skills and training while volunteers handle some of the more routine func\u00ad tions a.nd service activities. In addition, volunteer programs require the officer to use managerial and supervisory skills, enabling him to demonstrate whether or not he has executive abilities and the potential for promotion to leadership roles in the department. The results achieved by the volunteers mesh with the work performed by the officers. Involving older volunteers in police work is a great opportunity which can provide many benefits for both the police department and the community as a whole. CHARACTERISTICS OF OLDER VOLUNTEERS It is important to consider how much factual evidence there is to support the stereotyping and prejudices that link age with senility, incompetence, and lack of worth both in the labor market and as volunteers. Law enforcement agencies are recruiting older persons who have many qualities which enhance their effectiveness as volunteers, bringing into question the factual validity of the prejudices associated with the aged. The productivity of older persons in working situations has been researched and documented by industries. Many such reports identify particular companies in various parts of the United States which have continued to be profitable and efficient with workers well into their 70s and 80s. U.S. Steel has permitted more than 153,000 nonoffice employees to continue working as lonf) as they can maintain satisfactory levels of performance and can pass medical examinations. Polaroid has found that those employees who choose to remain on the job after age 65 tend to be better perfoqners. Even among older workers whose jobs entail heavy physical demands, high performance is main\u00ad tained. Among sales workers, older persons have achieved superior standing and have remained as high performers. Reports from insurance companies; auto dealers, and large department stores sug\u00ad gest that age and experience improve performance. 6 IV-4 .. ' .. ,. \" .. \" Many law enforcement ~gencies select and prefer older persons as volunteer resources. Older per\u00ad sons possess certain abilities and characteristics which match the law enforcement organization's ll,eeds. Among these are the following attributes: Available. There are potential older volunteer~ in nearly every community. Over 40 million Americans are 55 years of age or older. That's 20 percent of the total U.S. population-one out of every five persons-a percentage that is increasing yearly. Although few law enforcement agencies have taken full advantage of this volunteer resource, a growing number of retirees have time to give and want to provide volunteer service. Older persons generally no longer face the time and energy-consuming responsibilities of fulltime work or raising a family. However, many retired volunteers have to manage their living expenses on fixed (and often very limited) incomes. Incidental expenses, such as lunch money, public transportation fares, parking fees, mileage for the use of a personal car, and an increased fee for personal insurance premiums (necz:ssitated by volunteer work) may have to be provided for the older volunteers. The avzdlability of older volunteers may be limited because they may not be able to absorb out-of\u00ad pocket expenses.' But older persons are available. They have time to serve. Skilled. Many older persons do not posses~. diplomas and educational certificates often' associated with today's job functions and requirements. Very often however, their experience and skill levels more than compensate for this lack of formal education. This age group con\u00ad tains a considerable number of \"self-made\" persons. General intellectual abilities do not decrease with old age, and some of these abilities are enhanced by experience, assuming that mental faculties receive regular exercise and use. Those who perceive the elderly as inflexlble and \"set in their ways\" overlook the social, economic, and technological changes that have occurred-and the elderly have adapted to-in the last few decades. Older persons have had to adapt to radical changes brought about by the two world wars, the Great Depression, and modern means of tr~velllmd communication. This adaptability has required flexibility in their lifestyles and points ,~r ~,~w, Older persons can offer a 'wi.de range of experience, knowledge, maights, know-how, and personal contacts to a law enforcement agency. They show more interest in getting the job done than they do in agency politics, day-to-day bureaucratic practices, or office gossip and socializ\u00ad ing. At least half of the persons in this \"retired\" category already have the skills to serve as volunteers, or can easily be trained to do SO.8 Conscientious. The majority of today's older citizens relate the work ethic to their self esteem and value as an individual. Older persons often experience a loss of their life role and a change in their status as they retire from their jobs. They are often motivated to volunteer because they want (and need) to continue to make a valuable contribution and to be involved in meaningful . work. Older persons appreciate the opportunity to provide service and are conscientious about carrying out assignments. Research shows that older people are more conscientious in\\~he evaluation of decision criteria before making a dedsion. They require a 75 percent chance of certainty before , l' ' i);. , themselves, while younger people will take far greater risks. Industrial studies sho,w that older persons in managerial positions are less willing tqtake risks and hav~ a lower estimate of the value of risk in general. Older decision-makers tend to take longer to reach decisions. However, they are better able to accurately appraise the value of new information.9 Dependable. Older volunteers and older workers have impressive attendance records and low turnover rates and they show steady performance in their work. They possess the patience necessary to persist with a task-the result of maturing experiences of their earlier years-until it is completed. These findings indicate great reliability among older persons. Influential. Often, older persons are actively involved in many community activities and .c~n provide a valuable community relations function fo!' the police department. Many older per\u00ad sons have personal contacts in business, industry, government, and the local community. They are able to form groups to support 1aw enforcement programs. Informed. The older person may demonstrate a knowledge and awareness of the community's needs and concerns which are unknown to and sometimes overlooked by law enforcement of\u00ad ficers. Long-time residents possess a sense of the life and history of the community. They can <;lffer valuable perspectives to law enforcement programs and activities. With their knowledge and reasoning and discriminatory. capacities, the elderly provide unique contributions as law enforcement volunteers. Supportive. Gerontological research indicates that older persons are often more \"system\u00ad oriented\" than other groups. Generally, older persons strongly support the police and the criminal justice system in particular, while their feelings toward the court system often reveal ambiguity and dissatisfaction.lO Older volunteers are advocates for law enforcement. Older volunteers are involved in law enforcement in many communities throughout the United States. Their activities reflect the value of the unique qualities they possess. OLDER VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT Since the involvement of older volunteers in law enforcement is a relatively new concept, a look at some on-going programs may prove helpful. These programs have been selected to illustrate the possible roles for older volunteers in large and small departments, an9in urban and rura~ settings. Older volunteers are now performing COinmUi1 jy services, police services, and court servIces. Community Services Older volunteers, in supplementing responsibilities traditionally assigned to law enforcement agencies, have contacted citizens, maintained liaisons with social service agencies and other com-. munity organizations, assisted with citizen referrals, arranged meetings and lectures, conducted tours of the police department, and implemented community service projects (such as the Vial of Life) under the sponsorship of the departments. IV-6 f I . ~ \" , . , \", / '., \\ \" \"'.. .\" ~ -..... --..;,:........ F For example, in a West Virginia city of 75,000 people, older volunteers and the police department provide a useful and necessary service to isolated elderly and handicapped persons. (Nearly 20 per\u00ad cent of the population consists of older persons.) Operation Lifeline offers a daily phone contact to each program member, checking on basic needs for medical, fuel, and food services. The emergency intervention capability, combined with regular telephone reassurance, are activities which enhance the quality of life for program recipients. Operation Lifeline can be structured to serve large or small communities, both urban and rural. For a small commitment, the police department, the volunteers, and program members reap great rewards. Another area of community service-crimt: prevention education programs- focuses attention on older volunteers performing active roles to protect themselves. In some cases, older people pro\u00ad . vide crime prevention education and delivery programs to the entire community. They also organize Neighborhood Watch programs. In a mrai area of western Oregon, for example, a police department trained older volunteers in burglary'prevention. They visited homes, assisted in property identification, and conducted security surveys. In a three year period the volunteers delivered crime prevention education services to more than 1,000 households at a cost to the city of approximately $200 per year. The Senior Citizens Crime Prevention Program has had favorable results in terms of burglary reduction and has established the older volunteers as community leaders on many issues. The program has also created strong ties between the police department and the community. In other crime prevention programs, older volunteers serve as beat representatives; organize residential public housing security and escort teams; cooperate in Neighborhood Watch and vaca\u00ad tion checks; promote crime reporting; and work with community leaders, businesses, and youth groups. For example, in Florida a long-standing crime prevention education program for youth is operated by older volunteers. The Sheriff's Department Junior Deputy League program in one Florida county was founded and incorporated by a group of concerned older citizens in 1958. As a private, charitable, non-profit corporation, the League is able to give presentations on traffic safety, drug awareness, crime prevention, and other topics to all schools, both public and private. Supervis\u00ad ed by sheriff's department deputies, the older volunteers make presentations and conduct fund rais\u00ad ing activities to support program costs. For the older volunteers, there is satisfaction in making a worthwhile contribution. For the Junior Deputies, the benefits will continue into the future . Police Services Law enforcement agencies utilize older volunteers for community service activities, but may not realize the support they also provide in police services. They assist in evidence packaging, identifica\u00ad tion (as fingerprint or photography technicians), proofing lab reports, supplementing communica\u00ad tions, providing follow-up on investigative tasks, assisting with administrative and clerical func\u00ad tions, and helping with specialized tasks, such as search and rescue and emergency first aid. Older volunteers can perform many tasks normally assigQ~d to sworn personnel. For exampie, senior aides in a CaIiforniapolice department's crime analysis unit perform various tasks, including encoding data on incident reports, entering and checking computer data, and burglary alarm reports and intrusion incidents. The older. p~rsons who work a,s p:ut-time police employees supply manpower and skills to cOII~plete wor~ withm the department s time and budget constraints. Senior aides offer a new ~ternatIve for pollce managers. The most diverse police support roles are provided by volunteer posses. In an Arizona county, for example, the sheriff, has the right of posse comitatus (form~tion of the sheriff's posse), ~nd county residents have been actively engaged in general posse functIons for over twenty years. Smce 1973 a retirement community of 50,000 people has been patrolled by volunt.e~r posse member~'~4 hours a day, seven days a week. Posse members receive many hours of trammg; the~ have CitIze~ arrest powers and assist hl escort services and ~rowd and traffic contr~l. !he posse I~ funded entirely by community donations for patrol cars, umforms, and a commumcations system, memb~rs also con\u00ad tribute funds. The uniqueness of the posse program has led to replication and adaptatIon by other agencies. The sheriff's posse in a Florida county, which is managed by sworn deputies, consists of m~y retired civilian volunteers. The posse provides communications support through ham ra?IO operators; crime prevention education programs at homes, businesses, shopping centers, a~d falrs; search and rescue assistance with four-wheel drive vehicles; waterway rescues and patrols WIth posse members' boats; mounted police; motorcycle escort; and victim advocacy. In short, the volu?teer posse lowers costs to the sheriff's department and to the public. Posse members contnbute thousands of manhlours to police services. Court Services Older volunteer program activities in court services reflect the ambiguity and dissatisfaction many older persons feel toward the court system. For example, citizens in a California town established a group known ~s the Communit~ C:riminal Action Committee (CCAC). This committee promotes bette: p~osecutlOns,of c~eer c~Imm.als. by serving as a liaison between the police department and the dIstnct attorney s o~flce whIle cnmmal cases are proceeding through the system. Committee activities integrate the polIce, the prosecutor, and the citizens in an area of mutual interest. The volunteers, who are almost exclusively older persons, watch the court process while following a case research criminal records, and work wiih the district attorney. They keep performance record~ for all judges in the jurisdiction and analyze questionable legislative proposals. A member of the police department serves on the CCAC decision-making bo~d ~ith three v?l~?teer leaders. This board recruits, selects, and trains volunteers and establishes gUIdelInes for activItIes and dona- tions. When concerned citizens join together to demand accountability from the criminal justice system, law enforcement must be willing to offer support and guidance. Another court-related program established by a California police department deals with .the criminal victimization problems of the elderly. The activities of this program go beyo~d crIme prevention education efforts to reduce vulnerability. Rather, this program has been deSIgned to IV-S )\\ .. ' ./ assist older crime victims and individuals with civil problems. Older 'volunteers work in crime prevention and community education program delivery, as well as victim assistance and information and referral. Police officers conduct both civil and criminal investigations. Together, they benefit many of the city's older residents. The broad range Of programs possible with older volunteers enables law enforcement agencies to develop new areas of concern and successfully attack traditional problems. ROLES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOLUNTEER ASSISTANCE How can older volunteers assist officers in their duties? Older volunteers have been fulfilling the following roles in many police departments throughout the United States:ll 1. Community services; 2. Crime prevention; 3. Public 7. Clerical; S. Investigation; 9. Traffic control; and 10. Consulting on technical problems. There are many jobs in police departments which are not being accomplished primarily because the department does not have enough personnel to assign to these tasks or because personnel who do have time available feel the particular task is \"not in their job description.\" These jobs could be assigned to 1,(0Iunteers. There are also service-type jobs which take up a police officer's time' this \" ' work, too, rl~ight .be assigned to volunteers. However, placing older volunteers in law enforcement agencies might seem to be a very com\u00ad plicated task in itself-enough of a complication to scare off some departments. For example, there carl be hidden program costs and out-of-pocket expenses, professional staff tensions toward the volunteers, and concerns about potential liability situations. These considerations cannot be overlooked. Because they are so important, they will be covered in detail in the next lesson. While these are general issues common to all volunteer programs, if they are addressed during the program planning stage, then it is likely that a successful volunteer program can be implemented. The ad van- .. tages to be gained by sharing work and service responsibilities with older volunteers need to be thoughtfully and carefully assessed. Current volunteer programs in law enforcement which utilize older persons c/ear{v demonstrate that the advantages outweigh any problems. I --- ~--~ , ' \" ' '.'. , . . . ' CONCLUSION Law enforcement officers and volunteers have been traditional partners. In order to maintain ef\u00ad fective service delivery programs under the constraints of shrinking budgets and limited manpower, police administrators have recruited older volunteers. The efforts of older volunteers in commun~ty service functions and police assistance roles have met the organizational needs of departments while enhancing their community involvement and public support. As the older population continues to expand, law enforcement and volunteering will grow together-allies in the fight against crime. SUMMARY Since the earliest days of United States history. volunteers have been assisting law enforcement agencies. The demand for trained volunteers in law enforcement far exceeds the available personnel. Many law enforcement agencies are turning to older volunteers as a source of needed manpower for specific jobs, since the older volunteers possess specific attributes which are valuable to a police or sheriff's department. These attributes include availability, skills, conscientiousness, dependability, influence, and support. In addition, older volunteers are often well-informed about the problems and needs of the community's residents. Law enforcement agencies have been finding that volunteer programs can be viable tools for in\u00ad creasing the professionalism of the department and improving overall operations. Older volunteers are able to supplement certain responsibilities traditionally filled by fulltime of\u00ad ficers, thus freeing the officers to concentrate on enfoI'cement activities. Among the community ser\u00ad vice activities which older volunteers are successfully handling in many law enforcement agencies are: citizen contacts, maintaining liaisons with social service agencies, assisting with citizen referrals, arranging meetings and lectures, conducting tours of the police department, and implementing com\u00ad munity service projects under the sponsorship of the police department. Older volunteers are also able to assist with crime prevention programs and certain types of police services, such as providing follow-up on investigative tasks.

LESSON TWO STARTING A LOCAL VOLUNTEER PROG,RAM Identification of potential roles for older volunteers in a law enforcement setting is a necessary, but not a completely sufficient, condition for deciding to develop a volunteer program. Other fac\u00ad tors must be considered by individuals who want to establish such a program. This lesson describes f6ur general issues which need to be addressed before actual program development begins. These issues are: 1. Agency commitment 2. Agency costs 3. Potential liability 4. Departmental environment These issues underlie such questions as: Would the department be willing to have the assistance of older volunteers? How much does a volunteer program cost? Who would administer the program? Where would the program be placed organizationally and physically in the agency? What sort of problems could elderly volunteers present to the department? Analysis of questions such as these will assist police department officials in determining whether or not to pursue a volunteer program and how to prevent or reduce any potential problems. COMMITMENT An agency cannot have a volunteer program no one knows about and cannot have a volunteer program no one wants. This statement addresses the essential factor in any decision to establish a volunteer program-agency commitment. There must be a willingness on the part of an agency and its personnel to become involved in and supportive of new enQeavor~, such as volunteer programs. Commitment does not exist in a vacuum. If a law enforcement agency wants to establish a program which utilizes older persons as volunteers, then a necessary 'first step is to make administrators aware that such a program could exist and that the program could be beneficial both to the department a~d to the community. \" As a first step, the idea of the volunt~~r program must be presented at various levels of the,agency or department. The program ideas should be discussed with those personnel who would be most likely to have the greatest interaction with the older volunteers. If departmental officials want to ob- IV-13 , . ,fl:', ,l,.\u00b7 ,\".,' : of personnel to the program, then these! affected personnel must be made aware of the potential benefits and drawbacks of the program SOl that they can express their support or resistance while the program is still in the planning stages. Sometimes the idea of a special pro\u00ad gram is discarded on the assumption that there would be no support for it. Agency officials say that no interest in the program had been expressed by departmental employees. However, no real oppor\u00ad tunity was offered to them to express their interest. Once a program idea has been presented and discussed, the agency's administrative officials may enthusiastically offer their commitment. Or it may require a consliderable amount of persuasive ef\u00ad forts by program developers to obtain their support. Outside groups in the community which sup\u00ad port the program can help in efforts to enlist the commitment of agency administrators. The second, step involves assessing the reactions of agency personnel to the idea of a volunteer , program in terms of their levels of commitment. If no one is interested in the program, it will never get off the ground. However, this rarely occurs. But equally rare is unanimous support for the pro\u00ad gram. It is more common to encounter mixed reactions. An administrator's reactions toward the program can generally be: classified into one of five posi\u00ad tions: supportive, tolerant, ambivalent, isolationist, and resistive. The (Jupportive position is the most desirable. With a tolerant response, no support is given and the individual will usually comply with the program if it is initiated. An ambivalent or vacillating response is, in the long run, most likely to be detrimental to the success of the program. The isolationist may condone the program but want it kept separate and distinct from the rest of the departmcmt. In the long run, this would also decrease the possibilities for a successful program. Finally, the resistive response is an open re\u00ad jection of the program idea. Assessment of organizational commitment requires consideration not only of the frequency of each type of response encountered but also of the departmental position or rank level of the responding employee. A response supportive of the program from upper-level administrators can overcome ambivalent and even resistive responses 'from lower ranking employees. Conversely, sup\u00ad portive responses at lower levels in the agency may be to no avail if the top ~dministrators are resistive. It is doubtful that any workable volunteer program can be implemented without at least a tolerant response from top administrators and an ambivalent response from the majority of those personnel who will work most actively with the volunteers. Agency commitment is an essential element for program success. Consideration of this element necessitates that appropriate agency or departmental personnel be made aware of the program and the level of their support assessed. If the agency response is favorable, then planning for program implementatiori should begin. If not, a major barrier has been encountered. Considerable work must then be done to develop a positive agency attitude. Otherwise, the program will be rejected. Other obstacles or issues also will be raised before commitment to the program is obtained from departmental personnel. These issues, which require further consideration in determining the feasibility of the local volunteer program, are: agency costs, potential liability , and \" . \" / \" AGENCY COSTS d It is ofte.n incor~ectly ?ssumed that a volunteer program costs no money. After all the vol t oes contnbute hIS serVIces free of charge. However, a volunteer program does co~t m un eer ~hese c~sts .have to be regarded as a budgetary matter.

Since these are continuing activities, it is necessary tt keep tra~::'~ IV-IS \" ',\" the amount of time consumed. For example, the non-profit Pinellas County, Florida Sheriff's Junior Deputy League, Inc. shares personnel costs with the Sheriff's Department. The Sheriff's Department covers personnel costs for the program coordinator, four unit commanders, and four secretaries. The League contributes approximately 30 percent each year. Even when volunteers are paid minimum wages, a program can still operate at costs lower than those required for most fulltime employees. For example, in San Diego, California, senior crime analyst aides are paid $3.00 an hour. When their wages and work are compared to a fulltime clerk typist's salary, the savings to the department are nearly $5,000 each year for each aid. Fringe Benefits. A cost analysis should also include the fringe benefits for each paid staff member who works with volunteers, prorated on the basis of the time he spends on volunteer program ac\u00ad tivities. Travel. Some older volunteers will require transportation assistance. Taxi fares, fuel and depreciation for police department vehicles, and a mileage allowance for volunteers who use their own vehicles should be computed in the cost analysis. Some transportation costs might be eliminated through contributions. For example, the volunteer program in Cottage Grove, Oregon involves extensive transportation. A crime prevention van, which is donated by a local dealership, is recalled after a minimal mileage is accumulated and reclaimed for retail sale. The volunteers are then provided with a new v~. There are many community resources available to meet transportation needs and costs. Equipment. Any additional equipment needed by older volunteers or for program implementa\u00ad tion should be listed in the cost analysis. In Huntington, West Virginia, for example, the major equipment cost for Operation Lifeline is a telephone line and a desk. Supplies. A good record-keeping system assists in evaluating a volunteer program. The costs of the forms needed to keep records on the volunteers should be projected. Printed materials may be needed to train volunteers and to operate the program. Additional stationery and office supplies will be consumed. Contract. If the law enforcement agency hires consultants to work on the program, contracts with outside agenices, or pays speakers, then these costs should be included in the program's budget. Other Costs. Adequate insurance coverage for volunteers to protect both the agency and volunteers from potential lawsuits may be necessary. The expense of \"riders\" on city or agency in\u00ad surance policies and the costs of other forms of protection must be taken into account. Indirect Costs. As a general rule, add 150/0 to the program's costs to cover contingencies and in\u00ad direct costs not identifiable in a visible manner. 2 Once the direct and hidden costs for the program have been identified, a comparative cost analysis can be developed to show the ways in which volunteers can reduce service delivery costs for the police department. This budgetary justification for the program can serve as a convincing fact to share with the department and the community in firmly establishing the volunteer program. An ac\u00ad counting system should be devel<:.\\ped to permit these cost .. , l' I .-, . l If such a budgetary analysis demonstrates a potential cost savings to the department then program managers must identify a source of funds for the volunteer program. Will the funds come from the department's budget? If there is no supporting budget line item, then consideration must be given to developing a funding source. A possible source of funds is other areas in the departmental budget. Budgetary categories which can be used to absorb anticipated costs should be identified in conjunc\u00ad tion with the possiblity of reallocating existing financial resources. Potential Federal, state, and local sources of funds also should be reviewed. No savings can be realized if the initial funds needed to start a program are not available. An ac\u00ad curate assessment of program costs and budgetary support are crucial elements for consideration in the establishment of a volunteer program. Funding Sources Some possible funding sources are: Federal funding agencies, such as the Departments of Justice; Health, Education, and Welfare; and the Administration on Aging. Federal programs such as ACTION, which coordinates volunteer programs nationwide. State planning agencies within the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration network. Regional and local planning agencies. \" Local service clubs and groups. Local chambers of commerce. Area agencies on aging, and other social service agencies. Banks and savings and loan associations. Community civic groups and churches. POTENTIAL LIABILITY The possibility exists for incidents to occur which lead to legal liability. This is another important factor to consider while reviewing the feasibility of establishing a volunteer program which involves older persons. These situations can arise out of what is known as tort claims. Torts are dvil, as op\u00ad p,')sed to criminal, legal wro~gs. They bring about liability. Liabiiity may lead to an award of money damages. The best defense against civil litigation is to avoid it in the first place. Law enforcement agencies need to plan for potential liability situations confronting volunteer programs with which they may . be associated. A great diversity of laws and statutory provisions have been enacted by most states to IV-17 t_, problems from interfering with the operation. of volunteer pro~~a~s. In states where these laws do not entirely eliminate potential liability situations, the ageI!~y utIhzmg the volunteers ought to secure private insurance coverage. A comprehensive plan should be developed to protect the state, the law enforcement agency, and the volunteers. Although the question of liability is a complex one because circumstances di~~er greatly from o~e state to another, a simple and effective solution can be developed once the specIfIc areas of potential liability have been identified. Types Of Liability There are various kinds of liability inherent in volunteer program operations: Tort Claims Against The State. Every state except Maryland provides some method of recovery by the injured party for the tortious acts of its agents and employees. La~ enforcement depa~tment personnel are usually considered as employees of the state. A volunteer IS not ~enerallY consIdered to be an employee of the state, since there is no contract for hire or compensation. However, there are a series of cases indicating that the volunteer may be considered as an agent who renders a valuable service to the state. In such cases the state is liable for thtl tortious acts of the volunteer within the scope of such service. A person who suffers an injury or a. loss as the result of the negligence of a volunteer performing duties under the direction of an organized volunteer program mtly, therefore, recover damages from the state. Tort Claims Against The Department Or Volunteer Program. Volunteers who are harmed or in\u00ad jured in the course of their program work may attempt to hold the program or the department ac\u00ad countable. The department has a duty to assure that the volunteer's visit and stay at the department is a safe one. If this duty is violated, then the agency may be liable to the volunteers.3 Tort Claims Against The Volunteer. Once a private citizen has volunteered to perform an act on behalf of the police department, then he owes a duty of care to. others in the ex~cution of tha~ act and can be held personally liable for tortious conduct. In practice, the legal tactic often used IS to sue the principal or employer (Le., the state) where there i~ a greater likelihood to collect m~ney to pay damages. The issue of confidentiality is relevant to th.IS ~rea. All volunteers who work ~n con\u00ad fidential areas (e.g., handling records of arrests and conVIctions) need .to be thor~u?hly tramed to use this information appropriately. This can be done by proper screemng and trammg procedures and need not be a problem.4 Liability Remedies Potential liability reme/'lies are contained in the city or county charter (or other appl~cable special acts); general or professional liability insurance policies; the Workmen'sCompensation AC.t; and local rules, regulations, or court decisions. It is essential that legal counsel be consulted o~ thiS m.at\u00ad ter.s Perhaps the best method of protecting the state, the agency, and the volunteer IS securmg general private insurance coverage. Many states have liability insurance which covers the state. and its agencies-the state accepts its full responsibility for tort liability situations and, at the same time, protects the public treasury. The insurance should also provide for legal defense. IV-IS '\" (1 .. _, I, ~.,\"\" I ,\" \" It is essential to check with the state attorney general's office and obtain legal counsel for clarification of the law in each jurisdiction. Depending on the state, volunteers may be placed under existing insurance policies by: 1. Defining the volunteers as employees or agents of the state; 2. Amending the\\Jolicy to specifically cover volunteers; or, 3. Making volunteers \"salaried employees\" by paying them a dollar a year. III addition, the liability relationship between the department and the volunteer can be limited and controlled by such provisions as: 1. All states have Workmen's Compensation laws, which cover employees injured while at work. Some states have extended ~~overage to include volunteers. Check with the state labor depart\u00ad ment to ascertain their policy. 2. Waivers are employed, not so much to avoid liability, but to inform volunteers that their work, as is true in any occupation, may contain potential liability situations and that they ma,: want additional protection. 3. Some sheriffs' departments cover volunteers under the posse comitatus laws. Liabilities are of great potential concern when considering the establishment of a volunteer pro\u00ad gram. However, experience demonstrates that when the volunteer is properly trained and adequately supervised, liability situations rarely occur. With adequate preparation, the possibility of losses due to liability litigation is minimal. DEPARTMENTAL ENVIRONMENT The implementation of any new program in a polic~ department or criminal justice agency brings about change. Within an agency, administrative operations, chain-of-command, co-workers, and even the physical location of personnel may change because of a new program. These changes are most pronounced and frequent in those sections or units where the new program is located. However, other parts of the agency will also be affected to some extent. In considering the/\u00b7':.ia~ibiIity of a local volunteer program, some thought should be given to the effects that th~ preseilceof older volunteers would have upon the agency or department. The creation of a suitable program requires that the departmental environment be mapped out and the needs and requirements of the organiza\u00ad tion in relation to the program be understood and addressed. Administrative -Bequirements. The initiation of a volunteer program, whether it assists with pre\u00ad sent activities or provides new services, will require some new and different administrative respon\u00ad sibilities. There will be more people to supervise and coordinate. More police officers will be in\u00ad volved in supervisory roles and they may require addition~l training to meet this responsibility. Scheduling may become more complex. Volunteers may be able to work for only short periods of time or during daylight hours, for example. Additional space may also need to be secured or current space adapted to accommodate volunteers . \".'. ;'.' \" , '_ ' 01 , There will be new internal communications requirements related t? the sh~ing o~ information through2ut the agency. Volunteers should qe given a sense of belongIng, provlde.d with an oppor\u00ad tunity.to work and share together at peer level~,. a~d receive .fe~dba~k from ~upervlsors on how ~hey are doi~1g. Information on organizational polIcies and admInistrative practices should be provided to volunteers. To create a sense of belonging and teamwork, departmental employees must be en\u00ad couraged to communicate with the volunteers. Discipline must be mE{intained. Quality performance standards, too, ?Ius~ be kep~ !,at .hi~h levels-for volunteers as well as paid staff. Nevertheless, the agency must maIntru~ a fl.e,?bIllty l~ Its own production schedule f';)r the personal and developmental needs of ~olunteers. This IS especlal!y important for older volunteers who seek in volunte~ring a sense of fulfillment no longer av~lable In a regular work life. . Volunteers are extremely use~ul in supplementing the efforts o~ patrol offic~rs. The voluntee~~ can be trained to perform routine serviceaelivery tasks, thus enablIng patrol officers to conc.e~t~~L\\,;; on major law enforcement functions. However, the 9ffi~e~ will need ~o assume t~e resP.o?slbllItI~s for supervising and counselir.g the volunteers and providIng them with on-the,-J?? ,trruning. ThiS may involve further administrative complexities and the realignment of responSibIlities. .\\ Adjustments also will have to be made in the agency's nodnal a?mi~istra~ive practices for pro\u00ad gram planning arId organizing managing the volu~teers. C:0ordInatIon wIll have t? be c~nstant in order to eliminate unproductive or counterproductive practices that often crop up In an Increas\u00ad ingly complex administrative sysiem. Staff Relationships Every effort must be made to convince departmental employees to, accept the volunte~rs, if the volunteer program is to succeed. The introduction of this new element In an already estahhshed per\u00ad sonnel structure can produce tensions and resentments.7 Tension may stem from a variety of sources. First, there are a series of myths that some profes\u00ad sionals maintain about volunteers in general: \"They don't get paid, so they come an.d go a.s they lease \"or \"They meet their own needs and not ours and they take too much professIOnal time to ~onsuit whit and supervise.\"8 There are also myths that may affect relationships between fulltime employees and older volunteers. For example, older volu~teers ~ay not b~ looked upon a~ ~ valuable resource due to a persistent belief that aging is associated wIth decreasIng.~ork productIVI\u00ad ty and an inability to learn. Unless these beliefs I\\re seen as myths and not as real~tles, unne~essary tensions may result. Sharing the experiences of ,Qther l~w enforcement a.gencles regardIng the valuable contributions made by older volunteers can help to correct such attitudes. Another possible source of tension lies in the beliefs held by some officers that volunte~rs .are .in\u00ad truders. Paid employees may look upon the volunteer as a threat to job secu~ity or as an In~lc.atI0!1 that paid staff members are not doing their jobs. Many times an officer's attitude ~oward hiS Job IS reflected in his attitude toward volunteers. The majority of older volunteers are retired persons who do not want fulHime work and need not be viewed as threats. IV-20 f / \" ! / \" Under the pressures of tight budgets and frozen levels of paid personnel, volunteers may be assigned work that police offiic'-:ifs have neith~fthe time nor the resources to do. Conversely, tension may result when volunteers are assigned tasks that officers received satisfaction in performing in the past. Departmental personnel may encounter greater job stress when they take on the increased resRon\u00ad sibility for the training and coordinating of volunteers. Special burdens may be placed on these agency personnel in designing rewarding opportunities for older persons whose interest in voluntary work stems from a desire to gain relief from a routine, monotonous, and fragmented lifestyle. The older person may require support from paid staff members to help with physical problems or learning difficulties. Extra time and care may have to be given to some older volunteers. Professional staff res;'stance to volunteers can be expected to increase as the volunteers assume more diversified duties. This problem should no~ be discounted. Working out effective relationships between departmental personnel and volunteel\\~ requires care and attention. Proper training for both groups concerning the volunteer program c~\\n help reduce potential tensions. 9 Organizational commitment to and planning for this type of training effort is most important for a successful pro\u00ad gram. A careful examination of an agency or department's capability in this area should be con\u00ad sidered in any plans for local program implementation. Unions If there is a union or association of police officers, this group needs to be consulted at the initial planning stages and involved along the way. Although each manager of a volunteer program must decide on his own course of action insofar as union involvement is concerned, he must, nevertheless, agree upon working relationships with the union before any volunteer activity is initiated. Other\u00ad wise, misunde:rstandings, disagreements, and apprehensions may destroy the program. A resistive response on the part of a strong union will severely diminish administrative support for the pro\u00adgram. Some questions about volunteer programs that have arisen in the past and have been easily re\u00ad solved were based on the following concerns of unions and police associ~tions: Volunteers would eliminate paid positions. They would inhibit promotions. They would interfere with sworn personneL They t~Jould limit preferred as~jgnments (which would ~ring better working hours and easier working conditions).' ;J They would cause a reduction in fringe benefits such as overtime pay. The unions need to be made aware that volunteeJjprograms can actually enhance their professional standing a~ ens:ur~ better pay levels. IV-21 / '\" -----;---:-------- ~ CONCLUSION q I r \\ Before a law enA)rcement agency make a final decisicrAo recruit and involve older volunteers in the agency's operat.ions, a number of factors need to be considered in relation to the viability of a local program. Of primary importance is the issue of organizational commitment to the program. This requires both a,: presentation of the volunteer program idea to agency personnel and an assess\u00ad ment of the response in terms of support. As part of that commitment process, other major issues also must be addressed in order to determine the feasibility of utilizing elderly volunteers successful\u00ad ly. These other issues have been identified as: agency costs, potential liability, and the departmental environment. All of these issues are important and the possible problems they present are not insurmountable. However. a failure to consider each issue and its ramifications cpuld lead to the inappropriate im\u00ad plementation of a program or create unintentional resistance. Some primary~c~ncerns are: ,~ -~0 \\ --,..:~\\ 1. Although volunteers work free of charge, volunteer programs will cost thc;/~genci money to operate. 2. While the likelihood is remote, liability suits are possible in a volunteer program. 3. With volunteers, the law enforcement agency will have to make administrative changes and in\u00ad itiate new administrative procedures. 4. Volunteers could become a source of tension and resentment to paid personnel. A law enforcement agency should not initiate a volunteer program until each of these considera\u00ad tions have been carefully examined and decisions made regarding them. SUMMARY To be successful, a program utilizing older volunteers must have the firm support of police de\u00ad partment personnoi. If departmental administrators are not supportive or tolerant, the volunteer program stands little chance of succeeding. To gain this support, the program coordinator must present the idea of the volunteer program at all levels of the dep~rtment and provid~ employees with an opportunity to ex\u00ad press their support or resistance while the~program is still in the planning stages. If resistance is en\u00ad countered, considerable work must be dorl~ t.Q generate a positive agency attitude. I' . , )! \"; ,) A police department which wants to establish a program utilizing older persons as volunteers must carefully consider the costs to the agency, potential liability, and the impact which the program will have upon the denartmental environment.

Program implementation re\u00ad quires a great deal of effort and involvement on the part of many people. For a volunteer program to survive and grow, strong commitments are needed from everyone involved with it. According to the National Information Center on Volunteerism, Inc., one out of every four or five volunteer pro\u00ad grams fails within the first two years of operation) Program implementation involves three major components: planning, initiation,'and monitoring. The volunteer director/coordinator plays a critical role in overseeing 01' managing these processes, as the diagram below illustrates in a simplified format. Phases of VOLUNTEER PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION Planning phase Initiation phase Program Management ~:------ Monitoring phase The program management component encompasses the entire imple\u00ad mentation process. The absence of strong program management In any phase can result in program failure. IV-25 , As the diagram points out~ the program management component encompasses the entire im\u00ad plementation process. Strong program management is necessary t.o progress through each of the phases; its absence in any phase can result in program failure. By applying effective management techniques in each of the program phases, the issues and obstacles raised in previous lessons can be overcome. The diagram also illustrates that the program phases run in a continuous loop-even after a pro\u00ad gram has been set into operation, information or feedback gathered in the monitoring phase should be used to generate new plans for improving, revising, or expanding the program. Thus, new pro\u00ad gram phases continue to be initiated and subsequently monitored; the program, if it is effective, becomes self-perpetuating. The three major phases of planning, initiation, and monitoring represent a developmental se\u00ad quence. It is not uncommon to find programs which are performing poorly because they were in\u00ad itiated with little planning or permitted to continue operating without adequate monitoring. The planning phase establishes the nature and scope of the program within the agency. If considerable efforts and resources are expended in this phase, then potential problems can be greatly diminish~~d. The initiation phase represents a fairly short but critical period when changes in personnel and pro\u00ad cedures are established and the program itself is actually put into operation. Management sensitivity to program needs and the capability to \"get the program launched\" is most important at this time. The monitoring phase involves utilizing various management methods and tools to continuously assess the program's daily operations. Each of these three phases is discussed in more detail in the following sections. PLANNING PHASE When an organization becomes aware of a particular need or problem, or learns that funds are available for a certain type of program, there often is a strong desire to \"d.o something about it.\" Like the diver who forgets to check the water level in the pool before he jumps off the high board, the organization which ('/leaps before it looks\" often ends up in serious trouble. Organizations which neglect the planning component usually initiate programs which, if they do not jail entirely, spend much of their first 12 months trying to decide what they are supposed to be doing. The logical premise that \"careful planning must precede initiation\" often is overlooked in the rush to \"do something.\" Planning is thejirstphase ojprogram implementation and it cannot be skipped. An ef\u00ad fective planning process considers the agency's needs and climate as a first step. The second step consists of actually designing a volunteer program, using the information gathered in Step One. Plann,n~ Principles For Volunteer Programs In general, planning should define the scope and purpose of the volunteer program. It should represent the io.tegration of agency and staff needs with volunteer resourc.es. Planning is a dynamic process which must involve everyone who will be affected when the plan is implemented. Super\u00ad visors, patrol officers, and civilian employees who will work with the volunteers should participate. They can assist the program manager by identifying unmet needs in their work, volunteer oppor\u00ad tunities, and requirements for translating needs into opportunities. The specific program objectives for volunteer services within each division or unit should be formulated with the active participation IV-26 j' I ), . , I' \", / of staff members. Planning must also involv,e others ~ho have the. skills needed to promote the pro\u00ad gram, such as the law enforcement agency's public information officer, civic leaders, directors of other volunteer agencies, and the local media. Program plans should be flexible enough to allow for future changes while avoiding the pitfall of mUltiplying too quickly the number of tasks and assignments which volunteers are expected to fulfill. It is possible to both under plan and overplan a program. The scope of the planning process and the ti~e involved should reflect the resources which can be allocated to the program. Except for very sImple, small programs, the planning process usually requires two to six months. Longer plan\u00ad ning times without program startup tend to dissipate enthusiasm for the program. Planning efforts should begin by focusing on a few activity areas at a time. Planners often benefit by visiting the directors of other volunteer programs and asking questions about operational meth~ds a?d problems. It never hurts to learn from the experiences of othe~s. However, each pro\u00ad gram IS unIque. Law enforcement planners should remember that they cannot simply copy another program and expect it to work with equal success.' The planning process should involve the agency's chief administrators, who should review and ap\u00ad pro~e the program plans as they are developed. Their informed I:;:ommitment is required to promote the Involvement of staff members at other levels in the agency. It is this administrative group who can establish the policies necessary to implement the program. Needs And Climate Assessment Simply stated, a needs and climate assessment addresses the questions of:. what can volunteers do in the agency and where can they do it? To answer these questions, a number of procedures and t~chn:lqueS call b~ used. Representatives from various sections and units of the agency can be as\u00ad sI~n~d to a plannmg task force or committee to identify needs. Questionnaires or surveys can be ad\u00ad mInIstered or the program manager can informally talk to various staff members at all levels of the agency about the work which volunteers could perform. A task analysis of various jobs in the department may identify some areas for the utilization of volunteers. For example, the program manager can ask agency personnel to identify those tasks they have performed in the past few days which they rather would not do (in order to free their time for better use). Or personnel can be asked to identify jobs which need to be done but which they seldom have time to accomplish. The program manager \u00b7should also ask these same staff members how they . would feel about having elderly volunteers perform each of these tasks. But whatever techniques or methQds are used, a list of tasks which could be performed by the older volunteer should be com\u00ad piled. Some possible roles and opportunities for utilizing eJderly volunteers in law enforcement agencies were presented in Lesson One; these roles and task functions might serve as a starting point for the program manager as he conducts a survey of the personnel in his agency. Once the job task list is compiled, then three other planning operations should be initiated. First, job tasks requiring similar levels of responsiblIityand capability should be grouped to define a job or position for the volunteer to fill. Second, those jobs or positions which require more responsibili\u00ad ty and commitment from volunteers should be separated from those which require less. Finally, a IV-27 (: '; j JI \\i :' -----~------~ priority ranking should be assigned to those positions which are more important to the agency's needs and which should be filled first. ;.) A good rule for planning a potentially successful volunteer program is to develop jobs at every skill level which have some interesting and challenging components. Simply dumping all the menial and distasteful tasks onto volunteers is a sure way to shorten the program's life expectancy. It is also a good rule to start small-it is unwise to attempt to meet all the agency's needs at once. A small program in which the volunteers do a few things well will be more satisfying to all concerned. Such a program can easily expand in the future. Once the positions to be filled by elderly volunteers have been identified and ranked, then the pro\u00ad gram manager must analyze the organizational climate in order to determine where th,e volunteers should be placed. Some sections or units where the volunteers would have to be located in order to perform specific job tasks may provide little or no support. Resistance to volunteers on the part of staff members or supervisors may create an unfavorable work climate for the volunteers. Ideally, volunteers should be placed into, or' work closely with, sections or units where they are performing the roles which were asked as \"first priorities.\" Because the roles were considered to be so impor\u00ad tant by agency staff members, the environment should be one of support and appreciation. Plan\u00ad nil1g decisions are most difficult when the more important volunteer roles would require interaction between the volu.nteers and the most resistive members of the department. Under such cir\u00ad cumstances, other lower priority job assignments should be considered or plans should include a major effort to orient and educate those agency personnel who will work with the volunteers. Planning should also consider the physical environment where the older volunteers will be work\u00ad ing. Locations which would require extensive walking or climbing jtairs should be avoided if at all possible. Other factors to consider are noise (will the volunteer be working in areas with constant background noise?)\" lighting (can written materials and writing assignments be comfortably read?), and safety (will the volunteer worry about his personal safety or be too concerned about protecting his personal property, such as a wallet?). Once the law enforcement agency's needs and climate have been assessed, jobs identified and ranked, and potential organizational placements considered, the program director should begin working on the second step in the plamiing phase: designing the actual volunteer program to meet the agency's needs. Program Design A program design is comparable to a master blueprint; it provides the program directo~.with a step-by-step guide for developing the program, initiating it, and monitoring it. A program design defines the goals and objectives of the program, its stl,~,cture, operational procedures, timelines, budget, and staffing needs. It indicates what resources will be needed and who will do what, when, how, and for what purp'ose. Preparing a good funding proposal for a volunteer program is an exer\u00ad cise in program design. Based upon the needs assessment, the first step in designing a program is to develop goals (the end result of the volunteer program effort) and objectives (specific actions that need to be taken in order IV-28 / \\. 1.' } I' \\. ~ .' to reach or achieve a given goal.) Next, a workplan should be drawn up detailing the activities that ne~d to be un?e.rtak~n to reach the objectives. This workplan should indicate the time frames in . WhIC~ each a~tIvity w.Il~ take place and describe who will be involved in the activity (people should be descnbed by ~ob posItIOns, not by names. For example, if a job task must be performed by both a volunteer radIo. ope,~ator. and an officer, then these titles will be used in the work plan. The pl~m would not specIfy: Officer Mark Thompson and Volunteer Jim Snow will work together ... \") A budget should be developed, in as much detail as possible, outlining the costs to establish and opera!e the progra~. Recruitment, selection and placement procedures for the volunteers should be establIshed along wIth the necesary forms, such as job descriptions. Wh~n the volunteers arrive to begin work, it may be necessary to adjust the schedules of some supervIsorS', police officers and civilian employees. Any contemplated adjustments should be incor-. porate? int\\) the program design. The program director will alsl) need to plan time for training since the p~~ ~talff members who will be working with the voluntee~'s may need to develop new skills if they wIll De expec;:ted to supervise, counsel, and train the volunteers. Extra time should be built into !he schedules of fulltime employees who will be providing on-the-job training for volunteers attend\u00ad Ing staff meeting!! and maintaining records dealing with the performance and superviso~ of the volunteers. Met~ods which will be used to monitor and evaluate the program should be described in the program desIgn. The de~igll plan sh?uld also address an~ ,necessary administrative changes that will accompany program ImplementatIOn. ~ew agency polIcIes and procedures which will be necessary to facilitate volu?t.eer . program operatIon ~hould be specified. Existing policies and procedures should be mOdI.fled If nec~ssary and co~sIderation should be given to changing any unwritten policies which may Interfere wIth the effectiveness of the volunteer program. . The organization of the program itself and its relation to the law enforcement agency's organiza\u00ad tIon structure should be spelled out. A good design describes the lines of authority within the volunteer program and be~ween the program and the agency. Areas of responsibility for volunteers ?nd ~~ency personnel are clearly indicated. Individuals with policy-making responsibilities are IdentifIed, Generally speaking, the administrative structure of a volunteer program can be classified as one of two types. One type views the volunteers ,as an unpaid staff member while the other views the volunteer as part of an independent auxiliary. In the first structural type, volunteers are placed in the agency dIrectly under the supervision of paid staff members. This requires that agency person\u00ad nel, w~o may have ?ad little experience in directing the work of others, must now learn how to Su.~e~vlse. Und~r thI~ structure, the program director must provide the fulltime employees with traI~Ing and onentat~on to the volunteer program; in addition, the importance of the roles of the full time empl~yee.s wIll need to be explained carefully, or some employees may begin to feel that an extra burden IS be~ng plac,ed u~on the~: There may a~so be some discontent from employees who do not want anyone InterferIng wIth their Jobs; often thIS type of problem arises when employees who have been fulfilling a specific job for several years are asked to make changes in the job. Some of these employees may resent the idea that someone else, such as the volunteer program director would even know anything about their job, let alone have the audacity to suggest how it could b~ chan~ed to accommodate volunteers-this happens because the employee thinks he owns the job and IS the only person who knows how to perform the job tasks. He may not want to \" anyone else, and may be especially resistant if he is being asked to teach a volunteer how to handle specific components of his own job. When volunteers are used as an independent auxiliary, they may operate as a fairly self-contained unit, fulfilling a certain role for the agency while they also manage their own organization; with this type of program, the volunteers handle their own recruiting, screening, training, and administra\u00ad tion. More complex programs may involve elements of both type~ of administrative structures. Once the program design has been fully developed, a formal enctorsemehi of the plan should be obtained from the agency's chief administrators. This is important since it emphasizes that the agen\u00ad cy has fully committed itself to a particular plan of action rather tha,n the earlier, unspecified sup\u00ad port for a volunteer program idea. Throughout the entire design phase, the chief adminstrators should be informed that their feedback and support is welcomed- the program director can solicit feedback by forwarding tentative design plans and related problems or questions to the ad\u00ad ministrators. Once the design has been approved, major work can then begin on the initiation phase of the im\u00ad plementation process. INITIATION PHASE The planning phase of the program implementation process ends with a program design. Like a recipe, i.t specifies on paper the ingredients and directioI1s for creating a volunteer program. As with a recipe:, the actual act of combining the ingredients as prescribed may be subject to a great deal of variabiJiity and unforeseen circumstances. The second phase of the implementation process-initiation-addresses the actual activities in\u00ad volved in the program startup process. For purposes of discussion, these activities have been separated into two categories: program development and interventions. The first category, program development, includes those preliminary activities outlined in the program design which are necessary to prepare for the first volunteers in the agency. Interventions are those administrative ac\u00ad tions which must be conducted when the volunteers first begin work. The initiation phase is fairly brief-two weeks to two months-depending upon the size and complexity of the program. Program Development Program development activities may encompass a wide variety of functions; however, only the more common elements will be presented in this section. For the most par(preparatory activities are directed towards either fulltime employees or the volunteers. I l\\ Most efforts usually focus on orienting fuUtime employees since an effective ~\\(Orking relationship between staff members and volunteers is critical to program success. Special tr~ ,ning or orientation sessions should be provided to agency personnel in those sections or units wher/'r the volunteers will be placed. If the program plan calls for supervision of the volunteers by agencyipersonnel who have I' had little or no previous experience in management, then some type of supervi~lory training may be helpful. /; .r jj IV-30 ; ; 3: 14 ; Q$ inform agency personnel ,,:~o volunt~er, what each person's responsibilities are, and ho\" .. but wha~ to expect from the older suggestIOns of staff members should be consid d b th'iV pro lems wIll be handled.

It may also be desirable for recruitment purposes to prepare written promotional m~terials about the volunteer program and distribute them to interested individuals and groups. Audio-visual aids also should be developed if presentations about the program will be made to civic and volunteer groups. Recruiting, selection, training, and placement procedures to be followed in setting up the pro\u00ad gram should have been identified in the program design. In the program development component of the initiation phase, these activities actually begin. It is at this point that the program director begins - to contact community sources of volunteers. The)volunteer candidates are intervitwed and those ' selected are trained. On the basis of their performance during the training program, volunteers are either placed in the program or, if they prove to be unsuitable for a law enforcement agency, they are referred to outside volunteer groups. The volunteer training program significantly determines how welHhe volunteers eventually per\u00ad form oil the job and whether or not they are accepted by agency staff members.

Exactly what kind and how much informa\u00ad tio~ should be collected ,can be difficult to det~rmine. However, if the program objectives have been ~ntten to have the qualIty of measur~bility, then these obje~tives will dictate what type of informa\u00ad tIon should be collect~d. Program design and agency policy and procedures will usually dictate whatever else may need to be acquired. Where possible, volunteer program record-keeping should be made a part of the already existillg procedures for paid staff nembers. The program director should also allocate sufficient time and personnel to maintain an\\lidequate record-keeping system for those data collection needs which cannot be incorporated into agency procedures. Some standard files which should be maintained by the program are a \"volunteer file\" an~': \"program file.\"3 The \"volu,nteer file\" would include some background information on each volunteer from the applicatiol1 or registration form; 'the dates and types of training he received a.'1d his work assignment. , VOLUNTEER FILE NAME_, dif!~~::\\~~I~~~~~~O!; ~~~~~~~a::~7;:~ . eluded for each position would be a descrIption of J:b a~d th~ hours to be worked.

'. , Record-keeping should also incorporate qualitative as well as quantative data on the services be\u00ad ing provided by the volunteers. Supervisory assessments of volunteers and volunteer assessments of the program ought to be' collected on a regular basis. Periodic progress reports, which 'summarize .\"\\ volunteer activities,. should be SUbmitted by the employees who are supervising volunteers. All data which is collected over a set perio~ of time (usually monthly or quarterly) should be,:;,aggregated to supp]y program and agency administrators with a current overview of the program's operations. In addition, good files and crecords can prevent or reduce mistakes, identify good volunteer characteristics, substantiate claims, identify outstanding pefformance, and serve as part of a local cdhtribution (or match) in a Federally-funded project budget. The maintenance of files should be a continuous activity. Accuracy is of primary importance. Duplicate, irrelevant, or miscellaneous information should not be collected. If it has been, it should be discarded. Emphasis should be placed upon the consolidation and centralization Of all informa\u00ad tion files, limiting access to others. This will reduce the possibility that information will be lost; in I:' addition, it will provide a specific location to whicg,;agency personnel can forward records and reports about volunteer activities. ,):/ Good record-keeping provides continuity to a program. This is of considerable importance when changes in key management personneJ\"occur. Not only can new managers learn more quickly about the program, but they also can avoid'the problems of their predecessors . Evaluation ,;;/ Evaluation is the mechanism\u00b7 by which t,he program takes a look at itself to see if it has done \\Yhat was intended and if it is working as planned. Besides being a requirement which many volunteer pro\u00ad grams face as a stipUlation for funding, evaluation can identify which aspects of the program work or don't' work. In addition, evaluation procedures point out whether the program needs improve\u00ad ment, modification, expansion, or termination. The actual act of evaluation~ Lends further credibility to the entire effort in the eyes of the staff and the volunteers; Sharpens the ynderstanding \u00b7of the purposes, goals, . and problems of the program for ad\u00ad ministrators afld staff members; and\" Identifies indicators of success. Evaluation may be in!ormal{e.g., a review of program reports and files by program ad\u00ad ministrators) or formal (e,g., methodology, designs, and surveys are developed). It may be con\u00ad ducted by someone within the agency or program or an outside, independent consultant. Outside evaluators may be' beneficial if there is internal tension among volunteers, staff members, and pro\u00ad gram administrators, or if there is a question of continuing the program. Evaluation re~orts should < be timely and not assess what happened last year; they should be written clearly enough so that agen\u00ad cy personnel can comprehend the methods, purposes, and results of the study. Most importantly, they should have meaning. Interesting but trivial data will be of little value in helping to make .the program fUl1~tion better. Evaluation should asseSs the significant\u00b7 elements I , i , I b In general, an evaluation addresses two broad areas-theprog:;am itself and the individuals work\u00ad ing within the program. Insofar as the program itself is concerned, the goals and objeCtives of the program design will dictate t~e types of analyses which ,need to be performed. Data obtained in the record-keeping process will \"Qe the basic source of information about the volunteers and staff members who are involved witb the prograrll. The attitudes, perceptions, and experiences of thes,e individuals are also part of the evaluation process. Because evaluations can be undertaken for many reasons, the particular study design used will vary depending upon the purpose and the evaluation questions being addressed. In order to ensure that an appropriate study is done, it is important tl1at the purpose of the evaluation be clearly for\u00ad mulated before the data is collected and analyzed. The following chart provides a very brief over\u00ad view of the more common evaluation types and purposes. Sample questions and data used in assessments of volunteer programs are also provided. This chart is not comprehensive. Rather, it is presented only to serve as an example for the types of questions which need to be asked when evaluating a volunteer program.

If an evaluation is to be used for the purpm1e it was intended, its results must b~ acted upon. This requires that the evaluation findings be distributed to those personnel in the agency and program who can address the issues raised ~y the evaluation. Next, meetings should be arranged to discuss the evalua\u00ad tion results and recommendations; plans should then be developed to resolve any problems iden\u00ad tified. Evaluations that are read and filed benefit no one. Evaluation results that are dismissed as in\u00ad accurate or incomplete undermine the true purpose of the process-which is to critically examine the qfiality and worth of the program. Once, a program has begun, evaluation provides the inputs for each new planning phase. OVERALL PROGRAM MANAGEMENT , It is:necessary that sound management principles be applied throughout the three phases of the program implementation process. In addition to the planning and monitoring functions described in the previous sections, volunteer program managers must also be able to make decisions, motivate people, coordinate their work efforts, cOIr.stihnicate with them, and delegate authority to them. Because there is no single role for a manager, but rather a diversity of roles, the program manager must develop the flexibility needed to skillfully respond to many different types of situations and people. In the law enforcement agency, these managerial skills and abilities are critically important since older volunteers may have little understanding about the nature of police work; it is up to the program manager to effectively use the skills of the volunteers by assigning them to jobs they can handle and then providing them with the necessary training, support, and supervision required for program success. ~rogram managers have three major concerns in the planning phase of program implementation. Tht) first concern is to develop strategies for involving agency staff members in the implementation !}Ir'ocess. This task can be accomplished by: ,1. Providing staff members with ample opportunities to express their feelings about the program in a non-threatening environment. 2:. Exposing staff members to personnel in other agencies which use volunteers and asking representatives of these agencies to discuss the types of se\\\\'vices rendered by older volunteers, their strengths as \"employees,\" and problems which may occur, as well as methods of solving these problems. 3. Soliciting rutd using suggestions and recommendations froffilstaff members during the pro\u00ad gram planning phase../ 4. Identifying receptive individuals and workingiiwith them; the program managers should not at\u00ad tempt to convince all employees that the voltint.eer program is beneficial-there will be some staff members who have negative attitudes toward the program.~,) 0 5.

ThethProgr: managers should be wary of employees who suggest only tri~ial ro es or vo un eers? ose w say nothing at all or those who keep asking the same questions over and over agam when the program manage; has already answered these questions satisfactorily.4 The second concern is to identify a few job task areas where superior perf~rmance b~ the volunteers will produce outstanding, and immediately visible results. It is ~ot Su~flcient to s~mplY start the program small so that resources and effort will not be spread too thm. ~Olnts of n:~mum program impacts and benefits should h~ ~onsidered. This .ca? be done by settmg and stIckmg to priorities. But too often, when resistance IS encountere~ w~thm an. agenc~, then only the safe an~ easy things are 'tried. However, good management requzres mnovatIon-wlth a focus on future op portunities and an avoidance of past problems. Properly delegating work and responsibility is the ihird major management co~cern in t~e plan\u00ad ning phase. No one person can do everything well; nor can one person do everythmg. EffectIve pro\u00ad gram management requires that other individuals-both staff me~?ers and volunteers-. take charge of certain program areas. Knowledgeable, competent, and wtlh~g perso~~el must be Iden\u00ad tified and responsibility for a program area delegated to them. EffectIve admmlstrators learn to recognize their own limitations and their appropriate role as a \"manager\" of people rather than as a \"doer\" of things. Effective delegation requires: 1. That the responsibilities being delegated to each person are defined clearly and comprehensive\u00ad ly; 2. That the tasks delegated form some unified whole and are not bits and pieces; 3. That ip,dividuals are chosen for assignments which utilize their strengths and avoid their weaknesses; 4. That standards of performance are mutually set; '\\~) 5. That individuals with delegated responsibility have a voice in decision-making; and 6. That individuals with delegated responsibility are kept fully informed.s Finally, effective delegation requires ~hat the pr~~ram ~ana~er really allow individuals to perform without conLtantly \"looking over theIr shoulder and dlrectmg them. During the initiation phase of program implementation, heightened mana~erial concern sho~l~ ~e focused on coordination of activities. When the program design was bemg prepared, actIVItIes should have been planned in their proper \"real-life\" sequence and relationshi~ to e~c~ other; thus, if the manager assigns an ~mployee to obtain desks for the volunteers, t~IS. actIVIty shoul~ be planned so that the task is completed before the volunteers show up fo~ theu fust day on the l.ob: Effective managers will oversee the entire program development op~ratIO? to e?sure that the nght hand knows what the lef,t hand is doing, and that tasks are accomphshed m theIr proper sequence. . ' \" , \" .-(i I .\"::!,< This requires that all groups be kept informed about each other's progress; it also means that the manager will need to conduct regularly scheduled coordination meetings to deal with problems of delayed schedules. While motivating others is a constant and pervasive managerial role, it becomes particularly im\u00ad portant in the program initiation phase when older volunteers are being brought into a law enforce\u00ad ment agency for the first time. The key to successful motivation and recruiting is to identify and em\u00ad phasize the role of the program in meeting the volunteer's basic human needs. In surveys of the reasons why people volunteered, some responses given by the majority of the respondents were:6 Wanted to help others Enjoy volunteer work itself Had sense of duty Rewarding relationship with people served Enjoy being with people Work is extremely interesting The program manager should keep these reasons constantly in mind when talking to older volunteers, who often obtain many positive personal benefits from donating their time to a law en\u00ad forcement agency. In addition, designing the jobs to fit the older volunteers' needs for peer-group relationships with others or achievin~ success from accomplishing needed work will ensure their continued motivation on the job. This is where the manager should also consider the benefits to be gained by recognizing work that has been performed we1l7';;hile a public recognition (such as a newspaper article about a volunteer) goes a long way in motivating volunteers to achieve, so, too, does a \"thank you\" or a few words like, \"You did a great job, John! Your analysis really helped tell us we need to put more cruisers in that neighborhood!\" In the monitoring phase, managerial emphasis should focus on the continuing concerns of pro\u00ad gram operations, such as public relations, recruiting, program diversification, in-service training, funding, and evaluation. During this phase, the interpersonal skills of the manager become increas\u00ad ingly relevant as the program recycles itself. In order to retain personnel, obtain program improve\u00ad ment suggestions, and/or diversify the program, managers must effectively commuriicate with their supervisors, peers, and subordinates. Some guidelines to keep in mind during this process include: 1. Recognize and relate to each person as a human being who has feelings, opinions, and goals that are as important to him as yours are to you. 2. Realize that each individual has certain strengths and weaknesses. 3. Recognize that people will do things for their reasons and not yours. Translate your needs into theirs and the chances of a favorable response irlcrease. 4. Make the most of your time with someone-plan your mee{~ng and rank those things you want to discuss in terms of their importance. 5. Keep individuals informed. When people are left out, they tend to reciprocate. IV-43 , 1\\ Recognition and support of the old~r volunteers are especially ne~ded at this time in order to maintain their interest and enthusiasm for the program. Managerial fadur~ to attend to such matters shortens the length of the volunteer's service commitment and increases turnover. Conversely, th~ manager must not permit lower standards of service. o! 'perfo~mance for volunteers because lower standards will negatively affect the program's credIbIlIty. HIgh perf~rn;t-a~ce stan~ards m.ust be maintained although this may, on occasion, necessitate some type of disCIplmary actIon agamst an older volunteer.

Uninformed Optimism: A preplanning state of implementation-the program concept sounds good and there is verbal support. Problems and obstacles have been discussed and feelings are strong that they can be overcome. II. Pessimism; Real planning and program initiation begins, but problems and obst~cles are tougher than expected. The department may \"forget\" the program by withdrawing its finan\u00ad _ cial and organizational support. Volunteers may feel that their work is pointless. .. -III. Realism: If the pessimism state is overcome by determination, planning, and support, then the program is about to turn the corner. Perceptions of what can be done are realistically ex\u00ad plored. The program begins to operate within the confines of the agency. Volunteers know and accept their responsibilities and limitations. \" IV. Informed Optimism: The services provided by the volunteers begin to be recognized as valuable contribut.ions to agency functioning. There is a fresh burst of energy and support. Additional; realistically feasible roles for volunteers are identified and efforts are expanded into these areas. Because of experience, problems and obstacles are handled more effectively. V. Satisfied Acceptance: The program's place in the agency is ensured. A niche has been treated for the volunteer operations and, when new agency problems arise, the program is considered as a viable response. \" Director/Coordinator Of Volunteer Services The most crucial management position in any volunteer program is that of the director or coor\u00ad dinator of volunteer services. With the possible exception of some early activities in the planning phase, this individual, as prbgr~ manager, will have primary responsibility for program implemen\u00ad tation and operati0n. The quickest way to gauge the potential Sl.lccess or failure of a volunteer program is to look at this individual. If the program is being taken seriously by the law enforcement agency, the program manager is a capable, carefully selected person who is in a paid supervisory position within the agen\u00ad cy. He was hired or involved at the beginning or in a very early phase of the planning process. While this is not always practical since funds may not be available until the program begins, it should receive priority consideration. If not, the program manager has the problem of instituting plans which someone else has made. The director/coordinator should be considered as a member of tl)e law enforcement agency's regular\" administrative staff and have direct access to the agency's policy-makers and chief ad\u00ad ministrators. When a marlager is being selected or hired, job qualifications should include ex\u00ad perience with the agency, one like it, or the criminal justice systentj in addition, service as a volunteer program director is also a factor to be considered. It is also desirable to select a program manager who is familiar with the community from which the volunteers will be drawn.

''-\"' < \" \"'; If the program is going to use 30 to SO volunteers or more, then a fulltime director/coordinator is suggested. With fewer than 30 vclunteers, a half-time manager should be adequate. For five to ten volunteers, a volunteer should be able to direct the program or a current staff member can absorb the program management responsibilities. 8 Because the director/coordinator spans the boundaries between the law enforcement agency, the volunteers, and the community at large, he serves as a crucial linking pin. As a controller of com\u00ad munication, this person plays a major role in dispelling the myths about elderly volunteers which can prevent a positive program experience. . CONCLUSION Implementing a volunteer program involves three major phases: planning, initiation, and monitoring. The program manager plays a critical role in coordinating each phase of program im\u00ad plementation. The planning phase, which establishes the scope and purpose of the volunteer pro\u00ad gram, involves two st~ps: first, a needs and climate assessment, and second, a detailed program design. Once these steps are completed, work can begin on the initiation phase of the implementa\u00ad tion process. The initiation phase addresses the actual preparatory activities to involve older volunteers with staff. Program development activities in this process include orientation sessions for full-tim.e employees, and recruiting, selecting training and placement of older volunteers. Interventions, Dr how vadous problems are handled, or not handled, in these early stages of program implement~,tion can have a strong impact on the program's future. As the program continues, the need for more for\u00ad mal and regulated monitoring arises. During the monitoring phase, record-keeping systems and evaluation designs are established. This material is essential for management and future planning purposes. In addition to the planning, initiation, and monitoring functions, the director/coordinator of volunteer services must also be able to make decisions, motivate staff and volunteers, coordinate their work efforts, communicate with them and delegate authority to them. The program manager must develop the flexibility needed to skillfully respond to many different types of situations. SUMMARY Careful planning must precede the implementation of the volunteer program Program implementation requires a great deal of effort and involvement on the part of many peo\u00ad ple; because so many people are involved, the volunteer program must be planned carefully. The planning process establishes the nature and scope of the volunteer program within the agency and involves a consideration of the agency's needs along with actually designing the program. This pro\u00ad cess involves four major principles: (1) It should define the scope and purpose of the volunteer pro\u00ad gr'.lm; (2) The scope of the planning process and the time involved should reflect the resources which can be allocated to the program; (3) Planning activities should begin by focusing on a few activities at a time; and (4) The planning process should involve the agency's chief administrators. IV-46 1 I . , ........ .. If the agency expects\u00b7 its volunteer program to be successful in the long run then agency officials' must carefully monitor program activities in order to detect and deal with pr~blems as soon as the~ sur.fac~ . Program administrators must establish procedures to maintain records and program data in order to ma~age and evaluate the program and plan for the future. The main. thrust of the monitoring P?ase IS the development of a data base and information system which will enable the program dIrector to know: (1~ The w~o, what, when, where, and how of daily program activities; (2) Whet~er these ~pe~atH:;,ns are In conformance with the program design; and (3) Whether the pro\u00ad gram IS,accomplIshIng ItS goals and objectives. Record-keeping represents the cornerstone ofa good evaluatIOn plan. However, before a record-~eeping system is established, administrators must clear\u00ad ly formulate the purposes of pro~ram evaluations. Once evaluations are conducted, the results must be acted upon and problems whIch have been identified should be resolved. The absence of strong management for the volunteer program can result in program failure. The volufIt.e~r .~rogram coordina.tor plays a critical role in overseeing the program. Sound ~anagement prInCIples must be applIed throughout the program planning, initiation, and monitor\u00ad Ing pro~esses. The progra~ m,anager must develop the flexibility needed to skillfully respond to many dlrferent. types of SItuatIOns an~ people. The interpersonal skills of the program manager become IncreasIngly relevant as the program recycles itself, IV-47 . , , / REFERENCES d'cial Department Volunteer ervlces , I t Manual, Denver C u I 's K Bashant Volul1teer Program Deve 1973, p.ll. , 1 of senior volunteers in the 101 Precinct of New Yor I Y 5-166 2 sam' pie J'ob description is based on the ro e , D Mo'lnes Area Community College, 1970, ,~l\" 16 .

When recruiting, selecting, and placing older volunteers, the manager of volunteer services should attempt to mesh individual needs with organizational goals in such a way that the volunteers can fulfill their needs by doing the agency's work. There are seven \"key steps\" involved for a police or sheriff's department in recruiting, selecting, and placing older volunteers. These \"steps\" involve: 1. Developing contacts with resource, agencies; 2. Developing personal contacts with caqdidates; 3. Conducting an orientation and informational meeting; ,4. Accepting formal applications for volunteer service; ,5. Interviewing volunteer candidates; 6. Conducting a pre-service training and screening process; and 7. Placing the volunteers within the agency. GENERAL PRINCIPLES 'I', The law enforcement agency should be selective in its use of time when it is recruiting and placing volunteers-otherwise, this process can become very time consuming. For example, it is too time consuming for the agency to attempt to recruit by using the general media. Issuing broad and vague appeals in the various media will produce a large number of people who want to be volunteers, but most of them won't meet the agency's needs. SU(lh a generalized public appeal also places a burden upon agency personnel who must screen and train the potential volunteers. The best recruiting method is to draw upon outside resource agencies which can assist ill attracting and selecting the types of volunteers the law enforement agency needs. The director of the law enforcement agency's volunteer program should establish contacts with individuals who deal with older persons on a face\u00ad to-face basis. Another source of assistance in the recruiting process is the older volunteers themselves. Older volunteers will be able to help recruit other older volunteers-happy, productive volunteers are the program's best recruiters. The enthusiasm older volunteers generate about their work and the law enforcement agency staff make them effective recruiters, especially since it is a relatively ne~d~.a to II allow older volunteers ~o work in law enforcement agencies. IV-49 , \"''''r I , \" I d I! !,'! , ,I I, I it I' I, .. , ,P \\ ~.. I 1, \" n'. ' ' ,,\"~, \" , \" . . tf ....,. While recruiting older volunteers, law enforcement agencies should assure them that they will be accepted and made to feel wanted by the agency personnel with whom they will work. The significance and the challenge of the work should also be highlighted. The quality of the volunteer program itself is an important recruiting attraction. The law enforcement agency volunteer program manager should identify a variety of specific job assignments prior to initiating a recruiting drive; in addition, he should also determine how many volunteers he needs to recruit. Before asking for a commitment from the prospective volunteers, they should be taken on a tour of the law enforcement agency so that they can understand the agen\u00ad cy's operations and needs-many older persons have never been inside a police station and their total concept of what a police station is like comes from watching television \"cop shows\" . It is best for the agency to show these older persons the inside of a real police department bef17re they commit themselves to the volunteer program. If it is possible, recruiting efforts should focus on forming groups of older volunteers who can work together on the same day and at the same time. This provides opportunities to enhance the per\u00ad sonal and social relationships valued by older persons. It is best to recruit an older volunteer for a specific assignment and for a specific period of time-not to exceed one year -an agreement which can then be terminated or renewed by mJ,ltual consent. A \"people\" file should be established to pro\u00ad vide a source of volunteers or volunteer references to meet future needs. Th~ -cfuitment and placement process should move as quickly as possible to involve older per\u00ad sons in volunteer work at the height of their interest and enthusiasm. At the same time, the recruit\u00ad ment process should be continJ,lous, not sporadic, in order to establish new groups, expand existing ones, and maintain a high level of participation. Older volunteers are available almost anytime, of the year, but concentrated recruiting drives should not be held during the holiday seasons when everyone is involved in other plans and activities. RECRUITING, SELECTING, AND PLACING VOLUNTEERS Step One: Contact Resource Agencies. Initiative is the key to a successful recruiting effort. Volunteers must be sought out. One of the better methods of finding potential volunteers is for the law enforcement agency's volunteer program coordinator or director to write a letter to service agencies, businesses, and civic organizations which are involved in regular face-to-face contact with elderly persons. The letter lets the directors of these agencies or organizations know that in the next few months the law enforcement agency is going to recruit a certain number of elderly volunteers. In addition, the letter provides a general idea of the kinds of volunteers who will be needed and seeks the names of older persons who can fulfill police department needs.l Some typical groups which have face-to-face contacts with elderly persons on a regular basis in\u00ad clude:2 Senior citizen centers; Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP); Social service agencies and public housing departments; / Area agencies on aging; Labor unions and companies with a retired persons club' , , Service Corps of Retire Executives (SCORE): Service clubs (which often have retired business men and women as members)' Retirement villages; , Bank officers (who may be able to provide leads); and Church groups. A community vol~nteer c~ordinating agency, such as a volunteer bureau, may be particularly helpful. As an orgamzed servlCe, the volunteer bureau is able to generate more publicity and reach more groups and, as a central coordinating service, it often is able to match a volunteer's skills with the most suitable job. In some instances, ~t may be necessary for the law enforcement agency's volunteer program direc\u00ad tor to make presentatIOns to these groups~ These presentations should focus on the work to be done and the kinds of older volunteers who are needed. Blanket recruiting messages should be avoided to prevent people from volunteering for the wrong reasons. The resource agencies may also be a source of other program support for the law enforcement agency-in some cities they offer to provide additional finances and sponsorship. Step Two: Develop Personal Contact With Recommended Candidates. When the directors of the various resource agencies have responded with their recommendations, the law enforcement agency's volunteer program coordinator should write a letter to each recommended older person who seems to be a possibility. If appropriate, the letter can mention who suggested his name. This letter should explain that the law enforcement agency is recruiting a number of volunteers and the person is invited to an orientation meeting and public discussion of the proposed program . . Step T~ree: Sponsor Orientation-Information Meeting. At the orientation and public informa\u00ad tIon meetmg, the volunteer program is explained-preferably by a uniformed officer. A tour of the depart~ent's.headquarters should b~ provided at this time. If the volunteer program itself is already oper~tIOnal, It should be 'a focal pomt of the tour. The orientation meeting will serve as a further ,,:eedmg-out ~roces~; generally, if the presentation is effective, 40 to 60 percent of the people atten\u00ad dmg. t~e ~eetmg wIll want to volunteer to participate in the program. Those who wish to consider partIc~patIon should be handed a \"Volunteer Program Information Sheet.\" The volunteer program coordmator should allow the participants time to examine, the sheet and ask questions if they have any. He should explain volunteer opportunities clearly so that the prospective volunteers can make a c?oice. ~ tim~ limit should be set for returning the sheet on which the prospective volunteer inM dl~ates ~IS assIgn,ment preferences. There should be adequate time for questions and answers at the onentatIOn meetmg. , Step l!0tJr: Re~e~ve Formal Applications for Service. should be pro\u00ad VIded wI!h a sufflcl~nt amoun~ o~ time to t?ink over the matter of volunteering, to work out their own !eehngs about It, and to JustIfy acceptmg the volunteer opportunity. They might need time to convmce relatives and friends that participation in the program will be worthwhile for them' in some cases, adverse reactions from friends and relatives will cause the prospective volunteer to drol' out.

Fu,(those who fail to respond before the deadline,the pro\u00ad gram coordinator should write a letter saying that he is sorry they did not respond in time. He should ask .if they are still interested and seek a new commitment. The coordinator should ask them to write back and he might want to enclose a stamped, addressed envelope. If these persons respond favorably, the program coordinator should follow up with another letter letting them know that there will be other opportunities and that he will be back in touch later. He should follow up on this promise. ,j Step Five: Interviewing Voll!nteer Candidates. Those persons who formally apply as volunteers by filling out the \"Volunteer Program Information Sheet\" should be invited to an interview, which should be structured with ~oth the needs of the agency and the iridivirlual in mind. The interview process involves three steps: pi'e-interview preparation, during-interview activities, and post-interview decisions. A. Pre-interview preparation: An interviewer, particularly one who has little experience with this process, must become familiar with the purpose of an interview and the techniques and qualities of a good interviewer. Inexperienced interviewers often may feel uncomfortable screening elderly volunteers because they feel it is inappropriate to interrogate people who are volunteering their ser\u00ad vices. When the interviewer feels this way, then only the most casual and superficial interviews are conducted. However. blind acceptance and inappropriate placement oj volunteers in an agency can do more harm than good jor everyone concerned. The basic goal of the interview process i~ to select. and place those volunteers who are most clearly suited to the jobs or tasks which the agency needs to have performed. This requires that the inter\u00ad viewer under~t.and the jobs or tasks which the volunteer will do and the requirements or qualities needed to perform them. In order to accomplish this, the interviewer must: 1. Get to know the volunteer as a complete person; and 2. Convey to that person the essential facts about the agency and the job or jobs which are available. There are a few general guidelines which can' always be applied when interviewing elderly volunteer candidates. The most basic is to always be concerned about the individual candidate as a person, not as an object to do a job for the agency, It is necessary for the interviewer to listen aUen\u00ad tivelY.:land hear accurately what the volunteer has to say. The interviewer's attitude toward the vohmteer candidate will determine the quantity and quality of the information which the candidate discloses. In addition, a positive personal attitUde will help to establish arid maintain a favorable rapport, which is a crucial requirement for a good interview. Adequate time without interruptions is another prerequisite for a good interview. Sensitivity to the comfort needs of older persons should be taken into account. This may be a simple matter of ar\u00ad ranging seating close enough for easy hearing, shutting out outside noises as much as possible, or ar\u00ad ranging chairs so that the older persondo~s not face the sun streaming through a window, bright light, or glare. Awareness of his own personal biases is also important to the interviewer. An interviewer's per\u00ad sonal dislike of certain types of volunteers because of their style of dress, appearance, behavior, and so forth should be held in check and not allowed to influence the conduct of the intervh~w or subse\u00ad quent decision-making. Interviews should not be conducted in a mechanical fashion ueing the same manner and pattern-each interview should be tailored to the individual volunteer. However, there are certain basic steps which the interviewer should follow at the beginning of the interview: 1. Perform introductions and express appreciation for the volunteer's visit and interest'1n the program. 2. Explain the purpose of the interview-match the volunteer's interests and schedul'frwith the agency's needs. 3. Have the volunteer complete any short forms, if necessary. 4. Start with broad, open questions to get the volunteer to talk. Questions should start with what, why, where, who, or how,' the interviewer should avoid questions which could bf! answered with a short yes or no. The interviewer should set a time limit in advance for the interview, usually not to exceed one-half hour. Those older persons who are lonely or isolated may tend to hold onto the interview because the personal contact and attention means a lot to them. Perhaps the most difficult yet interesting aspect of conducting a good interview is the establish\u00ad ment of rapport, or open communication, with the interviewee. Invariably, some interviewers seem to do this better than others. They seem to have certain qualities that are helpful in interviewing volunteers. Some of these desirable characteristics have been identified and include:3 Ability to converse easily with a stranger; Acceptance of people; Skill in observing or sensing other peoplePs reactions, attitudes, concerns, and personality traits; Ability to speak clearly and explain matters in simple terms; Capacity to recognize individual strengths and potentials; Familiarity with the volu.nteer program; and Ability to guide the conversation efficiently without sacrificing sensitivity or purpose. B. During-interview Activities. Once the prelimiary introductions are over and some rapport has been established, the activities of the interviewer fall into two general ',.\" .l ... ~ ab:~::' in order for the volunteer to be fully informed, the interviewer should tell the volunteer 1. The agency or department's organizational structure and function; 2. The role and place of the volunteer in the agency and the particular tasks that wI'11 b formed;'. e per- . 3. ~!~ relationship between the volunteer's service and the total services provided by the agency; 4. The areas of volunteer and staff responsibility. Se~ond, in order to de~ern;tine ~he suitability of the volunteer for the job, the interviewer must ask ~uestlon~ a~o~t the motivation, mterests, skills, abilities, and personality of the volunteer In addi- I~n to 0 ~amm~ the necessary biographical information about ex erien\"~ and '0 ~kllls, .the mt~rvlewer ~~st motivation a~out the s eC~fi~ JO~~ hIS ;m?tIon~1 stablbty. hIS work habits. and his interpersonal relations with others in th~ work ~~lomg;h nSlglhts mto such ~actors can be gained through the use of non-directive questions which d. Wt' e vo u~teer to deCide what the content of the answer should be. Some examples of non Ifec Ive questions are: - 1. What would you consider the ideal volunteer job for you? 2. i:a~:~ have you enjoyed most in previous volunteer assignments? What have you enjoyed 3. What kind of supervision do you prefer? Ddurbing. this ~rocess, it is important for the interviewer to avoid some of the more common errors ma e y mtervIewers, such as:4 1. Making decisions too early in the interview' 2. Faili.ng to understand or describe the job i~ sufficient detail; 3. Lettmg the pressure of duties shorten the interview time' 4. D~i?g more. talking than is necessary; and ' 5. FaIlmg to dIfect the interview. As the.intervie~ progre~ses, the interviewer shQuld attempt to get an impression of the volunteer's personality, espeCIally as It relate~ to the tasks tb~t are to be performed. It is often hel ful to have ~omed s~rt ~~ ,~ctured form whl~~ reflects a prome of the particular worker charaJeri'tic, pre- er~e or e JO I. For example, must like to work alone\" may be an important consideration ~hlS frm ~h~? can ~e used a~ a guide the interview and assessing the interviewee o~ . e re evan .1Il~enslons reqUIred for the Job. If there is a great discrepancy between the referred !~b c~\",;,cte~Stl~S and what the volunteer has expressed or what the interviewer has Obs~ed then d. eret~sf es~ Ike1hhood that ~he volunteer would be suitable for the job. The possibilities of ~utual Issa IS actIon ater on are mcreased. ' IV-55 , , ~ i , C. Post-interview Decisions. After the interview has been completed, the interviewer must make a decision concerning the prospective volunteer. Assuming that the volunteer interviewee has not, during the course of the interview, decided against becoming further involved in the program, a decision must be made on whether or not to continue with the voluuteer's application. Volunteers who are clearly unsuited for the position should be thanked for applying and informed that they can't be used. This should be done with consideration and sensitivity. An explanation of \"whyn should be provided if the volunteer wants to know, If an immediate decision to reject the applicant has been made, the interviewer should not hide the fact with responses such as, \"We will get in touch later when we can use you.\" If the decision is to continue with the volunteer'S application, then arrangements should be made to provide additional orientation and pre-service training. In some instances, if an outstanding volunteer is encountered who doesn't fit the requirements of the available job, then consideration should be given to creating a job to fit the person. However, such a job should still be responsive to both the needs of the agency and the volunteer. Step Six: Conducting A Pre-Service Training And Screening Process. If the interview session has been successful, then the volunteer candidate should be provided with pre-service training as soon as possible. Depending upon the complexity of the job to be performed, this may be as simple as a pro\u00ad bationary-or \"try-out\"-period on the job. Or the agency might want to establish a formal train\u00ad ing program for several volunteers. A combination of both procedures may also be used. The purpose of the preliminary training or probation period is to obtain a true idea of whether or not the placement will work out. It should be made clear to the volunteer that this is part of the selection process and that the older person should not feel obligated to continue if he finds the train\u00ad ing or job is not to his liking. It should also be made clear that, based upon the volunteer's perfor\u00ad mance, a decision will be made by law enforcement officials at the end of the training or proba\u00ad tionary period on whether or not to use the volunteer and in what job. If the training program sets standards of performance, it is easier to release those volunteers who turn out to be unsuited for the job. After the training or probationary period is over, a follow-up interview with the volunteer should be held to discuss both his own decision and that of the agency. Volunteer feedback at this time can help to improve the pre-service training program itself. The follow-up interview also involves the older volunteer in a participative decision-making process concerning his job placement. Step Seven: Placing The Volunteer Within The Agency. Throughout the recruiting and selection procedure there will be certain points in the process where it becomes obvious that some volunteer candidates will not work out. Often the elderly volunteer will be the first to recognize this and drop out. If so, the volunteer program coordinator should not dissuade him. However, other unsuitable candidates will not be so perceptive and they must be \"de-selected.\" This is difficult to do because a free gift of time and help has been offered and is being rejected. The volunteer who is rejected may develop feelings of inadequacy toward himself or hostility toward the program or law enforcement agency. When the need for termination arises, honesty and courtesy is the best approach for the volunteer program coordinator to use.

The department should establish a \"volunteer pool\" in order to have qualified applicants available to fill volunteer program j()b vacancies. Otherwise, the agency's programs may stagnate from a lack of qualified personnel. Recruiting, selecting, and placing volunteers involves seven key steps; in order for the program to be effective, the director should foilow each st(~P in sequence. These key steps include: (1) Developing contacts with resource agencies; (2) Developing personal contacts with candidates; (3) Conducting an orientation and informational meeting; (4) Accepting formal applications for volunteer service; (5) Interviewing volunteer candidates; (6) Conducting a pre-service training and screening process; and (7) Placing the volunteers within the agency. The employee seleded by. the law enforcement agency to recruit, interview, and place elderly volunteers must possess sp~ciql skil~ and abilities as an interviewer of older persons. The basic goal of the interview process is to select and place those volunteers who are most clearly suited to the jobs or tasks which the law enforc-ement agency needs to have performed. This requires that the interviewer understand the jobs or tasks which the volunteer will do and the requirements or qualities needed to perform them. However, it also requires that the interviewer understand how to communicate effectively with older persons, their special needs during an interview situation, and how to establish rapport to elicit information. In addition, the interviewer must be a compassionate person who has the ability to tell a prospective volunteer that his services are being rejected, without appearing cruel-the interviewer must be a person who is sensitive and considerate of the feeling of older volunteers. 7 I IV-58 ~ . , \" , \" .. !:,,' ~ .' \", I I REFERENCES 1. .~~~~~i~~~~er~~ f~~~:r~e~~~~: seven step~ below !lnd the charts and gr~phs National Retired Teachers AssocIation, American Washington, DC: NRTA-AARP:1:;;~ p~~t~~~3ror Independent MatuTlty, in ,c., ,PI' . 4.

'. ... ... ,,'.. .. \" LESSON FIVE SUPPORT AND TRAINING OF OLDER VOLUNTEERS Successful program operation depends upon the effective utilization and retention of older volunteers. This can be accomplished by providing training and support which is responsive to the needs and concerns of the older volunteers. The older volunteer who feels ill-prepared for the job or unaccepted at work will quit since job satisfaction is of primary importance to the older volunteer, not monetary incentives. Thus, the program's training and suppport functions have a considerable influence in retaining the older volunteer in the law en,forcement agency. ELEMENTS OF SUPPORT The underlying purpose of all support activities is the development of a climate which provides a feeling of acceptance and worth to the volunteers. While the provision of support does not necessarily motivate a volunteer to do more productive work, the lack of it may \"demotivate\" him and have a negative impact upon productivity) Since sources of job satisfaction vary from volunteer to volunteer, each element of support will be more gratifying to some volunteers than to others. However, it is suggested that all support elements be developed and utilized in order to pro- vide a comprehensive support system which will have maximum effectiveness in the retention and productivity: of the volunteers. Seven \"key elements\" have been identified; these involve peer in- . terac~ivn, staff interaction, appreciation or acknowledgement, performance evaluation, skills dev1(lopment, security needs satisfaction,and physical needs satisfaction. \\1, . . Peer Interaction Confidence-building or mutually supportive relationships with other volunteers \u00a5e very impor- lant to the older volunteer. Volunteers who are close to the retirement transition period (five years II on either side of retirement) enjoy having a friendly understanding with others in similar cir- cumstances. Whatever builds possibilities for peer support should be maximized by the volunteer program coordinator. This could include team approaches, cooperative projects, or social events. It could take the form, for example, of organizing several older volunteers to share responsibility for one. job position. This will encourage the volunteers to share experiences related to their common assignments as well as provide them with flexibility in the use of the time each commits to the task . Volunteers supporting other volunteers have a \"multiplier effect\" in terms of satisfaction and pro- ductivity .. 'Staff Interaction While the provision of peer interaction opportunities can do much to provide the older volunteer with a satisfying work environment, the quality of staff interaction with him plays a critical 'I jj II II \\ , i \\ i L If ,I n \\1 l! 11 li f\\ '1 Ii 1) ., ii 'I Ij ,~ 11 )1 q d \" n l' q II !I \" q his productivity and acceptance of his role in the agency. Good relationships between volunteers and paid staff can virtually ensure the maintenance of volunteers in the program. Volunteers are basical\u00ad ly people who care; they would not be offering their services otherwise. They expect, in return, the care and concern of their organizers and supervisors. Increasing the skills of staff members who . work with volunteers can be more important than training the volunteers themselves. The more capable the front-line staff members become in' working with volunteers, the more capable volunteers will become in working with them. Staff members who make a special effort to know the names of volunt~ers and something about them personally demonstrate to the older volunteer that he is a valued member of th~ work group. Small things which staff members can do, such as greeting volunteers in a friendly mann.?:r, also can help. Thankillg the volunteer for \"a job well done\" also will be appreciated. When volunteers speak with paid staff members about things not formally related to the program or ask advice on pel~onal matters, this should be looked upon as a measure of the volunteer's respect. It's at inforirial moments such as these that trust, mutual respect, and support are strengthened. Acknowledgement and Appreciation The third support element is the formal and informal acknowledgement or appreciation shown the volunteers by the law enforcement agency. Since volunteers do~'t take money for their work, a sense of recognition for what they are doing becomes more important. A pat on the back for a job performed correctly demonstrates to the older volunteer that his efforts are being noticed and the re:mlts are being appreciated. In a more formal mode, some examples of volunteer reward sugges\u00ad tions, adapted from a manual for court volunteer development, include;2 1. Volunteer J.D. cards or lapel pins; 2. A ~wearing in ceremony; 3. A personal appreciation letter at the beginning of service or after a successful year of service; 4. A volunteer recognition certificate at the end of a term or for outstanding service; 5. \"Volunteer-of-the-Month\" or \"Volunteer-of-the-Year\" awards, noted in a program newslet\u00ad ter andlor in the public press; 6. Publicized, \"newsyl\" human interest items about the volunteers in the local media; 7. An honor roll of active volunteers; and 8. Volunteer recognition banquets, usually held about once a year and, less formally, picnics and parties. More informally, voiunteers who are thanked for doing that extra piece of work, or spending that extra hour, know that their efforts are recognized. Asking and then following the advice of the older volunteer is an excellent form of compliment for earlier work done well. Praising the volunteer to other staff members and giving the volunteer more complex assignments also can serve as effective forms of recognition. .;:: .... , G I / Performance Evaluation Volunteers need to know honestly how they are doing. They also need to communicate their feel\u00ad ings and suggestions for the improvement of the program to their supervisors. Regularly scheduled review periods to examine progress and needed improvements provide support for both the volunteer and the program. The revi~w can take place in a conversation in which both the volunteer and his supervisor discuss how the volunteer has done and what he can do to improve his performance. The volunteer should be free to express his feelings about the treatment he receives from the supervisor and other leaders in the program. Open conversation of this kind enables feelings to be expressed easily and conflicts to surface and be resolved. The fact that the volunteer's performance is reviewed like that of paid staff members demonstrates to the volunteer the agency's perception that the job demands his best performance. . . Skills Development Insofar as the performance evaluation process serves as a mechanism to demonstrate, in a challenging way, the agency's interest in and concern for the volunteer's work, helping the volunteer to develop new skills serves a similiar function. Supportive supervisors will create an environment in which volunteers are productive because they are constantly stimulated to utilize new skills. To ac\u00ad complish this function, the supervisor needs to know what skills the volunteer brings to the job through his former work and experience as well as his present hobbies and interests. (A \"Volunteer Program Information Sheet\" -see Lesson 4 for sample-should be filled out by the volunteer and reviewed frequently by the supervisor\"). Because volunteers tend to choose initial assignments in which they feel comfortable, supervisors should be on the watch for new skills as the volunteers master each task they are assigned. Again, it is the stimulation and opportunity for accomplishmenlt . which provides the older volunteer with the personal satisfaction necessary for retention in the pro\u00ad gtc1..m. Security Needs Satisfaction Retired volunteers often have suffered from a loss of their role and status in life3 They may re\u00ad quite added encouragement and support in order to assure them that they are needed and wanted by the regplar law enforcement force. Like everyone, they fear the unknown and will be insecure if they do not know what to expect or worry about what might happen to them, This is especially true when the volunteers first begin working in the.police department. Entry-level volunteers often fear putting themselves in a \"bad Ught\" or making a mistake. Sometimes they hesitate to take on new tasks or assignments because they do not know what will be required of them and, because they are afraid to ask for explanations, they worry that theYIPight perform the new task poorly, bringing ridicule upon themselves. Many of these fears and insecurities can be alleviated through a careful orientation process, through linking the new volunteer with the experienced or \"veteran\" volunteers, through sensitivity on the part of professional staff, and through allowing each older volunteer to progress at his own pace. Reassurance at times when the older volunteer is hesitant or unsure of his task may alleviate his anxieties and facilitate better performance. \\\\ . , Physical Needs Satisfaction Taking care of the physical needs of the older volunteer is an important element of support. If the volunteer's physical needs and comforts are seriously neglected, then his morale and productivity suffer. What physical needs of the older person need special attention? If the older volunteer has no con\u00ad venient means of transportation, then arrangements should be made to help them avoid the stress of public transportation by providing them with a ride to and from work. A special room set aside in which the volunteers can get togt:,ther for work, relaxation, or social purposes is another possibility. If the older volunteer serves through the noon hour, providing a hot meal will contibute nutritive as well as social benefits. Such small items as having coffee or tea available free of charge should not be overlooked. Finally, with most retired volunteers who live on fixed incomes, providing them with out-of-pocket expenses will avoid taxing their limited financial resources; if his volunteer service ends up costing the older volunteer money, then this may be a price too high for him to pay and he may have to drop out of the program, even though he is highly motivated. At its most basic level, the provision of support to older volunteers requires a sincere interest on the part of fulltime employees in the volunteers as people. Staff members, supervisors, and program organizers must be genuinely concerned about the well-being of the older persons who have donated their time to fulfill agency needs. If the staff members do not consider the work and workers worthy of their personal involvement, then neither will the volunteers. AN ONGOING TRAINING SYSTEM How does a law enforcement agency plan to train older volunteers? Training includes anything that helps to increase the realization of the volunteer's potential.4 More often than n.ot, training of older volunteers should be informal and personal. As a general rule, a volunteer should start on the job as soon as possible to capitalize on his initial interest and enthusiasm, General orientation ses\u00ad sions should be provided for all volunteers since these sessions are an important component of the recruitment and placement process-they help program coordinators make the correct judgments about the capabilities of each volunteer. It is best to present orientation sessions informally, with formal pre-service training reserved for those situations in which detailed information about the assignment is necessary in order to get the volunteer started on the job. Once he begins work, the volunteer's training should normally be on-the-job and continuous. In\u00ad itially the training is related to the specific job but it is gradually broadened to include information about the total law enforcement agency and issues of special concern to older persons. In this way the older volunteers can begin with assignments comfortable to them; then, after some on-the-job experience, they can broaden their horizons and progress to tasks requiring greater responsibility, each at his own pace. A training system that takes into. account these needs has four parts: orientation, pre-service train\u00ad ing, in-service training, and .-- .... Orientation Orientation begins with the recruiting process and enables the volunteer to take a look at himself and his own skills and at the job that needs to be done. Orientation can include a tour of the agency and should provide opportunties for the candidates to chat informally with present volunteers and staff members. Time should be allotted for the volunteer to discuss his observations with staff members assigned to the orientation program. What orientation consists of depends upon the kind of job for which the volunteer is being con\u00ad sid\\~red. If the volunteer is skilled enough to fill a variety of jobs, it might be useful to let him work briefly on a few different jobs so that a more informed choice can be made about a ~':\"manent assignment. Potential volunteers cal! also spend some time observing staff members at work. If possible, group meetings involving other potential volunteers should be held so that the can\u00ad didates can talk with one another and share each other's questions a.nd ideas. The candidates also need to meet with someone who can speak with authority about the law enforcement agency; this will help them clarify their own roles and enable them to develop an understanding of work per\u00ad formed by fulltime employees. A useful component of an orientation program is to provide volunteers with brief \"try-out\" ex\u00ad periences in the jobs which they could be performing. This could be done by developing \"role\u00ad playing\" situations related to the jobs: for example, during a training session volunteers could prac\u00ad tice greeting clients, working with a supervisor, using the telephone properly, and so forth. For ex\u00ad ample, if a volunteer finds, through \"role playing,\" that he is uncomfortable answering a telephone, then the supervisor might want to assign him to the crime analysis unit to work on data analysis assignments which do not involve direct contacts with the public. In summary, orientation sets the stage for later service. It can be quite informal. The volunteer program supervisor should maintain a flexible approach so that whatever he does is in the best in\u00ad terests of both the potential volunteer and the law enforcement agency. The orientation process ~an include, but not be limited to: A tour which includes informal chats with staff members and \"veteran\" volunteers. Brief service in a few jobs or observation of staff members at work. Group meetings. Practice opportunities with observation and constructive suggestions. Pre-Service Training Depending upon the complexity of the jobs to be performed and the extent of orientation train\u00ad ing, the agency might also want to provide pre-service training to the older volunteer. If tasks are fairly complex and the orientation experience is narrow in scope, volunteers should be provided with a detailed review of the job by the immediate supervisor and close supervision during the first few days on the job. This training relates to the actual beginning of work-it is at this time that the IV-65 , , i volunteer's store of resources and his skills are least known and his feelings of insecurity are most pronounced. Practical and immediate assistance is in order to elicit the volunteer's best efforts. One technique successfully used in pre-service training is to ask the supervis~r, trainer, ?r an e~\u00ad perienced volunteer to hold a conversation with the new volunteer at the conclusIon ?f the fIrst day s work. The purpose of the conversation is to give immediate attention to t~e solution .o.f problems that have come about as a result of inexperience at the job. Another process mvolves pamng the new volunteer with a more experienced one. The two go through the first day together nnd discuss what happened at the end of the day. Group meetings ca.n also be held to allow volunteers: to discuss with one another and :vith staff members what happened and what could have been done differently. Anot~er method ~Ight be to have new volunteers record part of their work, such as a telephone conversatIOn, for a cntIque later.' Pre-service training involves creatively assisting the new volunteers in an infor~al man~er to resolve the immediate problems that arise on the job. This training should contmue until the volunteers have gained enough experience and confidence to function on their own. \"Learning by doing\" is the best experience when the learning occurs in an environment of acceptance and assistance on the part of the staff members. In-Service Training The purpose of in-service training is to increase the volunteer's skil~s, to keep hi,? from fa~ling ~n\u00ad to poor work habits, to help him learn newer and better ways to do a Job, and to stimulate hiS deSire to assume greater responsibilities. What opportunities can be utilized for in-service traini~g? Me~tings of the .volunt~ers .themselves can provide such occasions-the volunteers can share their own Ideas about Improvmg Job perf?r\u00ad mance. Input sessions of various kinds can be scheduled to enable .a staff member .or an ?utslde resource person to present ideas relevant to volunteer performance. Staff m~etmgs Wlt~ !he volunteers should not be overlooked; part of the meeting can be used for educational or trammg purposes. Volunteers could also be invited to attend meetings of the paid staff members as part of their ongoing training. When outside speakers come into the agency to a.d~ress the regular forc~, volunteers could be invited if the topic relates to their work. OpportunItIes can also be sought m continuing education programs in the community. The main point here is that the volunteer pro\u00ad gram coordinator must provide regular in-service training opportunities-he should stru~tur~ ~ flex\u00ad ible program to assure continuous growth opportunities for the volunteers. If the a~ency ~s ,,:Ilhng to invest training resources in the volunteers, it demonstrates to them the value of their contmumg con\u00ad tribution. In-service training also should focus on those volunteers who, because they performed well at one level of service; are promoted into positions of more responsibility and comple~ity. W~ile volunteers often perform just as well in these new roles, there is no guarantee that they will, esp~c~al\u00ad ly if they are called upon to serve as supervisors in their new job. Providing some type of tranSItion training can be very helpful under these circumstances. If the new assignment involves completely IV-66 , . different tasks and functions for the volunteer, then the orientation, pre-service and in-service steps previously discussed should be followed again-this 'new training program can be instituted while the volunteer continues on his present assignment. Performance Review Training A final type of training which can be provided to. volunteers is based UpOD an evaluation of the volunteer's performance and the types of orientation, pre-service, and in-service training he receiv\u00ad ed. As such, it is part of the feedback process. Its purpose is to improve the performance of both the program and the voluntt!er. As training, the performance review process allows the supervisor to teach the volunteer the re\u00ad quirements of his assignment. What may have been an academic point during the orientation pro\u00ad cess or earlier form\u00a7 of training can now be dealt with from the point of view of actual experience. Performance review training should be flexible and informal, adapted to the actual conditions of the work setting. It should also be part of the evaluation process. For example, those volunteer assignments which require little more than general orientation prior to service (e.g., typing and filing tasks) should be evaluated at the end of two weeks as part of the placement process. Incorporated into this evaluation should be explanations and demonstrations of those activities or roles that may have been issues or problems for the older volunteer. A friendly supervisor should be available to ex\u00ad plain things, give feedback, and encourage good work. Periodic review and feedback meetings should be held at regular intervals, perhaps quarterly. Where appropriate, an individual work plan, based upon the responsibilities of the written job description, should be agreed upon at the beginning of a work quarter and reviewed three months later. If the assignment consists of routinely recurring tasks, the job description itself can be the basis of review. The review process enables the supervisor to provide feedback to individual volunteers on how they are doing and additional instructions on how they can improve their performance. It gives the supervisor an opportunity to listen to the volunteer's suggestions. After individual review and feedback meetings, it may be helpful for the supervisor to hold a group meeting for volunteers who have similar work assignments so that they can share work plans and feelings about how activities can be improved. The supervisor should also consider this a learn\u00ad ing experience for himself. Periodic review training will result in an improvement in the volunteer's knowledge, skills, and job performance. It also offers some other benefits, such as: Reinforcing the volunteer in tasks \\vhich he is performing currently. Suggesting the need for redesigning present assignments or creating new ones as the result of volunteer performance. .

Helping the supervisor learn how he can work more effectively with the volunteers. Whate~er type of training is offered, an evaluation of the training itself should be part of the pro\u00ad cess. As problems or shortcomings iIi the training program are identified, new training objectives should be developed; in addition, necessary changes should be made in the curricula, methods,. or instructors; and the revised training should be instituted. As part of the training program evaluatlOn process, it is helpful to know:5 1. The emotional reactions and feelings of the volunteers; 2. The usefulness;ivalue, and clarity of the information provided; 3. The effectiveness of trainers and the group processes utilized; and 4. Suggestions for future sessions and general comments. CONCLUSION Maintaining volunteer effectiveness requires support and training. Inclu\"ed in the provision of support are the following elements: 1; Effective peer, support among the volunteers themselves; 2. Promoting good relationships among volunteers and paid staff; 3. Showing appreciation to volunteers and providing them with a sense of accomplishment; 4. Letting volunteers know how they are doing and giving them the opportunity to express their own feelings and suggestions; 5. Providing volunteers with additional responsibility when they are ready for it; 6. Satisfying the needs ofyolunteers for encouragement and security in their work; and 7. Taking care of the physical needs of older volunteers. An ongoing training program will take into account the needs of older volunteers, including in\u00ad formal approaches and development at their own Pllce. Such training will include these four elements: \" I 1. Orientation beginning with recruitment and terminating with the successful placement of a volunteer in an assignment; ,I *'\" I 2. Pre-service training which assists new volunteers with immediate problems that arise on the job, until enough experience is gained to function on their own resources; 3. In-service training which provides opportunities to learn better ways of doing a job as well as preparation for transition to new tasks; and ' 4. Performance review training which allows evaluation, instruction and reinforcement on tIle basis of experience gained in the, performance of the job. SUMMARY In order to retain the older volunteer, the law enforcement agency must provide support and training which is responsive to the needs and concerns of the volunteers. Successful program operat~on depends upon the effective utilization of older volunteers. The pro\u00ad gram's training and support functions have considerable influence in retaining the older volunteer in the law enforcement agency. Key elements of support include: peer interaction staff interaction . . ' , appreCiatIon or acknowledgement, performance evaluation,' skills development, security needs satisfaction, and physical needs satisfaction. The underlying purpose of these support activities is the development of a climate which provides a feeling of acceptance and worth to the volunteers. An on-going training program should take into account the needs of the older volunteers for in- formal approaches and for development at one's own pace. ' The training program should contain four essential elements: (1) Orientation which begins with recr?itme~t ~nd terI?inate~ with the successfui ~Iac~ment of a volunteer in an assignment; (2) Pre\u00ad serVIce trammg, whIch aSSIsts new volunteers WIth Immediate problems until enough experience is gained to function on their own resources; (3) In-service training, which is a flexible program of opportunities to learn better ways of performing a job and preparation for transition to new jobs; and (4) Performance review training, which allows evaluation, instruction, imd reinforcement on the basis of experience gained in the performance of the job.

RESOURCE PR,OGRAMS: - - MODELS AND CURRENT CASES The time has probably already p~,ssed when police administrators can argue productively about whether it is better to use a trained professional or a volunteer to carry out a new program. Most of the evidence appears to be in on that question. The answer is: if the criminal justice system had suffi\u00ad cient money and personnel to use trained professionals for all its projects, that would be preferable. The stinger is that the money and the manpower aren't there. The real choice that has to be con\u00ad fronted today, therefore, is between performing a new task with volunteers or not attempting it at all. This section of the manual provides information about a large variety of ways in which volunteers, most notably older volunteers, have been used to implement new programs in coopera\u00ad tion with law enforcement agencies . The following pages present ten model resource program types and seven detailed case reports. This material is provided so that informed decisions can b~ made about the relative benefits and dif\u00ad ficulties involved with implementing a particular type of.\\ program. Space limitations demand that entries be kept brief, but an attempt. has been mada to identify the pros and cons of various types of programs . In each case, the model program type is first described in terms of its overall structure and pur\u00ad pose. Specific program goals are identified. Operations of either a typical or exemplary program of that type are described in some detail. Roles performed by volunteers are identified, and certain limitations or problems that}!'ight be anticipated are ca'~ed to the reader's attention. In most cases, three or more actual exam~les are repQfted where program variations have been used at different law;, enforcement agencies. The police departments involved arc identified in order to provide resources for contact if more information is desired. Finally, a selection of references or recom\u00ad mended readings is provided which includes information relevant to each model resource program type. DEFINITIONS Differences of ()pinion about definitions are to be expected. The special characteristics of each model resource pr\\)gram type are discussed in the first few paragraphs of each section, but opinions ;, \\\\ '\\ '\\ \" '1 , about proper classification may vary. It is conceded, for instance, ~hat OI>era~ion Identifi.catioil as a program type and Security Surveys as a program type could both fit under CrIme PreventIon Educa\u00ad tion, and perhaps all three could be bracketed unde~ ~ti11 another label. Ca~egories ~ave been selected here with an eye t.oward whether or not a sufficient amount of useful mformatlOn can b.e conveyed by focusing attention at that particular point. In other words, a degree of. scholarly precI- sion has been sacrificed in order to be a little more useful. . The model resource program types that will be discussed are: Operation Identification (a seed program) Security Surveys Community Crime Prevention Education Crime Reporting Programs Neighborhood Surveillance and Patrols Protective Senior Escort Service (a ~eed program) Health and Personal Security Programs (seed programs) Victim/Witness Assistance Court-Watching ., Direct Police Support Services Reference to a \"seed\" program in the above list means that a progra~ .has certain c~~racteris~ics that make it particularly useful as an instrument to introduce new partICipants to ~ddltIonal CrIme prevention activities and programs. Following this presentation of model resource program types are seven Case Reports. These reports provide more detailed information about operating characteristics of law.enforcement agen\u00ad cies that have. made notable commitments in terms of developing volunteer assistance programs. Case Reports are provided for the following law enforcement agencies: Jacksonville, Florida (Duval,!:ounty) Pinellas County, Florida Huntington, West Virginia Sun City, Arizona (Maricopa County) San Diego, California Santa Ana, California ~ Cottage Grove, Oregon Each Case Report is linked to developnlent of a particular type of community involvement or crim~ prevention program. The Case Reports also help to make c!ear that the best programs. are multi\u00ad faceted, incorporating elements from several program types 10 order to adapt to and derIve the op- timal benefit from local conditions. BENEFITS OF USING OLDER VOLUNTEERS We have heard about the \"graying\" of America. People live longer now. They remain active longer. Despite the fact that there are many isolated and destitute elderly citizens, it js also true that V-2 . ---'-.-.. - / n;t~ch of the nation's wealth, knowledge, and political influence is controlled by the nation's senior cItIzens. Law enforcement agencies can expect incre~sing pressure to provide improved services to the elderly. In order to accomplish this mission, most agencies will have to make use of the energy and resources made available by elderly volunteers. Volunteers require training, supervision, and a substantial amount of personal attention. Since !he older volunteer is eithe: unpaid or receives only nominal compensation, intangible rewards are Important .. He must be prrused fre~~ently. The volunteer must be told that his. efforts are recognized and ap~reclat.e~ .. Programs that utilize volunteers should also be structured to include opportunities for SOCial activIties. .' In return for this. attention, older volunteers provide numerOllS tangible benefits to the law en- forcement agency. Some are listed below: r( \\. Cost e~fectiveness. Money saved by using volunteers can be channeled into high impact expenditures. . Manpo~er effecti~en~ss. Swo~n personn.~l may be relieved of routine chores to perform more profeSSIOnally satIsfymg functIOns. One t~ained police officer, acting as trainer/supervisor for a volunteer group, can multiply his effectiveness., Crime reporting increases in response to community programs. Arrests and convictions may increase as the community becomes more alert to the needs and demands of the criminal justice system.

OBSTACLES None of the benefits just listed happen automatically. Obstacles must be overcome. For instance, planners worry about two fundamental attributes of volunteer performance. There is concern over volunteer competence and c~ncern over volunteer perseverance. Sinc~ competence is a product of training and supervi~ion, this obstacle can be overcome by attendmg.t? those matt~rs. Perseverance, on the other hand, is a product of organization. Sufficient opp~rtumtles for emotIOnal and social rewards must be provided to keep the volunteer on the job. 'Yhde both obstacle.s can clearly be over~Qme, the implication is that a certain amount of profes\u00ad SIOnal. guidance will be required if the law enforcement agency expects to receive all the possible benefits of the volunteer group. Conversely, a volunteer organization that is left entirel.y on its own, V-3 i\\tiIf~~.4Q:::Ji iii a 1$4. $ .' --~ ---.,-,...-- without any police commitment of support or guidance, stands a very good chance of failing to clear the competence or perseverance hurdles. In more practical terms, two more important areas of concern can produce obstacles for volunteerism: (1) police labor unions; and (2) liability problems. Superficially, volunteerism appears to run contrary to the modern trend toward police unionism. Actually, volunteers often make it possible for professional police officers to be more effective by extending the outreach of the department. Volunteers also create opportunities for sworn officers to do the kind of worle that they prefer. The planning of a volunteer program, however, should involve police union representation, and officers should be assured that the program is intended to enhance and extend current capabilities, not to displace personnel. The liability issue worries many police administrators. Some police planners are inclined to turn a deaf ear to the potential of volunteer assistance programs because they fear that a volunteer may do something, through ignorance or infirmity, that could create a catastrophic loss for the police department. The trigger word is \"liability.\" What if, during the course of working with the police, a volunteer should become injured or maimed? What if, through unprofessional conduct, the volunteer injured or otherwise damaged another citizen? Suppose the normal operations of the department were in some way temporarily disrupted? Suppose citizens started bringing lawsuits against the police department? These are frightening thoughts. They seem even worse than they really are because they involve matters that lie outside the career experience of most law enforcement officials. Fortunately, experience about liability risk manage\u00ad ment is available from insurance companies. The same kind of liability problems posed by police volunteers are faced every day by hospitals, manufacturers, utilities, and various service industries. The answer is simply this: volunteers do not represent entirely free labor. If you want to use 10 or 12 volunteers, you will probably have to set aside enough to pay at least one full-time salary in order to' cover your liability risks. That will be accomplished through the terms of some kind of limited group liability policy. Check into who provides insurance coverage for the largest hospital in your community. How about the largest industrial firm and the local newspaper? Haggle with the in\u00ad surance man if you like, and get some legal advice. But, in the end, buy the pOiky. Then settle back and enjoy your volunteers. , f MODEL RESOURCE PROGRAM TYPES Operation Identification Security Surveys Crime Prevention Education Crime Reporting Systems Neighborhood Surveillance and Patrols Protective Senior Escort Service Health and Personal Security Victim/Witness Assistance Court-Watching Direct Police Support Services V-4 . , \" , .I / OPERATION IDENTIFICATION DESCRIPTION Operation Identification is a well known crime . . . . . . . 1~~~ve~tIOn actIvIty WhIch was Imtiated, at least in gram has been publicized periodi~allY b::~~~ In II .

Anim~s have been notched or branded for centuries. Machine parts are frequently manufactured wIth ide~tifying numbers and printed currencies nearly always bear identifying serial numbers. Opera\u00ad tion Identification ~erelY applies this basic principle to the problem of establishing\u00b7 positive iden\u00ad tification of stolen property. Such positive identification is required for both successful prosecution and the return of discovered property to a rightful owner. With local variations, an Operation Identification program is normally conducted in the follow\u00ad ing way: engraving tools or other appropriate marking instruments are made available, free of charge to citizens who are interested in protecting persor \\1 property. Marking tools are borrowed from s~ch local distribution centers as the police department, a library, a fire station, or the office of a sponsoring civic organization. Distribution is normally accompanied by a degree of publicity to heighten public awareness of the service during a planned' 'campaign\" period. A certain amount of instruction is provided to the citi\u00ad zen at the time of tool borrowing, either verbally or through literature. This instruction may includf.. operation of the tool and recommended marking locatio~s for variou~ types of property (such ~s television sets, binoculars, typewriters, etc.). An authonzed number IS also suggested for use m marking property. One common variation of this basic procedure requires the concerned property owner only to contact a distribution center, which then schedules or dispatches an operator with marking equip\u00ad ment to the home of the citizen. The engraving is then accomplished by a trained operator on prop\u00ad erty designated by the owner; The operator/visitor then places the Operation 1.0. decal in an ap\u00ad propriate location to deter future burglaries. VOLUNTEERS Volunteers may be used at several points during a successful Operation 1.0. program. Volunteers may participate in the advertising or public awareness phase of the program as well as in the distribution or operation of engraving equipment. As is the case in many other volunteer programs, the u~e of older citizens offers particular and special advantages. For example, older volunteers have been useful in the following ways: ,. To contact and influence sponsoring or supporting community organizations, such as fraternal clubs or social and civic groups. The older volunteer may have long years of personal associa\u00ad tion with group members or leaders. To conduct door-to-door distribution of program announcement literature, or to make some other form of program announcement, such as might be accomplished at PTA meetings, senior \\ \\ citizen gatherings, or other public assemblies. To arrange for informal neighborhood meetings at which persons attending will receive familiarization with Operation I.D. , Q / , To staff Operation Identification information booths in local shopping centers or in downtown shopping areas. ':0 assist in the routine paper work required for enrollment and orderly pro:gress of the engrav\u00admg program. ~~ operate or control distribution centers where ~ngraving tools are picked up by participating cItIzens. To. visit homes of participating citizens in order to mark designated property. Even basic \"PIc.kup\" pr?~rams may be suppiemented by home visits by volunteers to residences of elderly or dIsabled cItIzens who want to participate. \\ To maintain property inventory records for the police department which is conducting the property marking system. In. additio~ to these ope!ational contributions, older volunteers offer a police department certain ~peclal benefIts that are dIrectly related to mature age. For instance: Peer Support. The older segment of the population, which may be the segment most vulnerable and needful of the Operation Identification program, may be more communicative and honest with an older volunteer. The older citizen may be reluctant to admit ignorance or lack of understanding before a much younger person, and may refrain from asking important questions. There is some dif\u00ad ficulty, for instance, in communicating the court's requirement for positive identification of prop\u00ad erty before a burglary conviction is possible. The older volunteer may be better able to communicate with his or her .pee~ group, since persons of the same generation may use familiar terminology or share other attItudmal bases for communication. The crime prevention message also enjoys in- crea~ed credibility when presented by someone of the same peer group. ' Leaders~ip. To the ?egree that. ol~er volunteers are well known in the community or are representatIves of established orgamzatIons, the older volunteer may be perceived as \"setting an ex\u00ad ~ple\" for the community. Also, the volunteer's seniority and greater experience lend credence to hIS rol~ as advisor to youn~er participants in the program. Experience. The older volunteer usually can offer the program more than time and attention If the 'p~rso~ is ~etired, he brings to the crime prevention program all of the career\" skills a~cumulated dunng a hfetIme of work. While it is impossible to anticipate precise benefits in this area it is a foregone conclusiol,l that the older volunteer's career experience will contribute to his effectIveness. One form that this benefit takes iSi! need for minimum supervision. Program directors report that the older volunteer-who may have 25 years in government service or in a sales position-works best as a.self-star~er. Supervision consi~ts o~ est~blishing guidelines and setting program goals. Goal accomphshment IS usually left to the ImagmatIon and skill of the older volunteer.

Some are itemized below: Operation Identification is not a new program. It has been used in various forms by many departments throughout the nation. Consequently, it may suffer from an \"old\" or \"fai~ed\" image in a community, particularly if the program was used some years before, then per~tted to decline or atrophy, and is now being resurrected for another ~ry. Too much .e~phasls on Operation Identification's effectiveness could be counter-productIve. Generally, It IS. bette~ to portray (and implement) Operation Identification as part of a more comprehensIve cnme prevention program. Lack of a standard \"authorized\" marking number weakens Operation I.D. as a national crime prevention instrument. Over the years, various localities have used Social Security numbers, telephone numbers, automobile registration numbers, and a variety of other ,codes that ru:e logged for reference. While it cannot be said that a universally acceptable standard number IS used in all cases, the modern consensus appears,to favor use of a state driver's license number when one is available. While some property owners do not drive a motor vehicle or may prefer to use a more easily remembered code, such as a Social Security number, the emergence of in\u00ad creased sensitivity to privacy has, in some cases, made identification of discovered proper~y by Social Security number impractical. The driver's license, on the other hand, can be routmely identified by police to locate the name and address of a property owner. Property acquired after the initial Operation I.D. marking is frequently left unmarked, whic~ leads to a gradual decline in security coverage as items are replaced. It should be noted that thIS need for a periodic \"booster\" campaign can be turned to some promotional advantage when recognized. Program evaluation is difficult. Some local studies have determined that homes exhibiting the Operation I.D. decal had substantially lower burglary rates than homes that we~~ no~ m~ked. Also, individual property owners have reported lower burglary rates after partICIpatmg m the program than before that experience. These superficial evidences of success, ~o~ever, are off\u00ad set to some degree by findings that burglary rates for an overall area can remam vIrtually unaf-\u00ad fected. At the same time, there is no evidence that property marking has actually facilitated the return of stolen property; nor has it significantly reduced opportunities to fence stolen property. Given these mixed results, most observers attribute the reduction in burglary rates to the tendency of Operation I.D. participants to become more sensitive to crime prevention needs in general and to build upon the Operation Identification experience to participate in more comprehensive crime prevention programs. OPTIMAL BENEFIT EXAMPLES It seems clear that if Operation Identification is best implemented. as a separate and single effort, only minimal and temporary benefits can be expected. The program is most beneficial when operated as a \"seed\" program, attracting participants to additional information and activities. f I ,. . , ---~ ---------- . ' For instance, Operation Identification creates an opportunity to schedule a residential security survey. The security survey will be the next Model Resource Program Type discussed in this chapter. With reference to optimal benefits obtained from the use of older volunteers to implement Opera\u00ad tion Identification, several examples are available. Three are listed below: The st. Petersburg, Florida Office of Crime Prevention has enlisted the assistance of squads of older volunteers. These volunteers, equipped with electric engraving tools and crime prevention literature, have contacted over 20,000 residences, a large proportion of which are occupied by members of the senior citizen population. These older volunteers receive training in residential security evaluation as well as operation of marking equipment. They are, therefore, in a posi\u00ad tion to conduct a security survey on the spot when an owner is interested. Program leaders ex\u00ad pect that peer pressure from these volunteers is a factor in obtaining compliance with security recommendations. The Montgomery County, Maryland Police Department uses senior volunteers primarily to assist in promotion of Operation Identification. Four senior volunteers contact civic associa\u00ad tions and make a presentation of the program to a leadership group. If the association accepts the program, literature and support materials are made available for distribution to members. Volunteers also carry out marking of property in apartment complexes housing large numbers of elderly or handicapped residents. The Police Department at Natick, Massachusetts, provides another example. In this case, an Operation Identification program was carried out almost entirely by a 20-member group of volunteers from the Natick Senior Citizens Center. Several Operation Identification variations have been developed to stimulate enthusiasm for the program within special interest groups. While these programs may be described as placing old wine in new bottles, the practice does occasionally improve marketability for the program. Variations utilized by various departments and evaluations of effectiveness are included in the following references. REFERENCES Title: Denver-Operation Identification -Final Report Author: O.R.

It also serves as a point of friendly contact between the police department and or\u00ad dinary citizens in the community who are concerned about their safety or the security of their possessions. The security survey, while it may be implemented in numerous ways, remains basically a site in\u00ad spection. The location is visited by a person who has been trained to detect predictable weaknesses. The site is observed systematically, and observations are recorded by the inspector. Normally the survey,concludes with certain recommendations being made for improvements. The same process might be followed for purposes of increasing fire protection or evaluating the property's true market value. In this case, the survey is directed toward reducing the chance of burglary or other criminal entry at the inspected site. Within the context of crime prevention programs, the security survey is frequently linked to Operation Identification programs. The loan of engraving equipment or the scheduling of volunteers to accomplish engraving in the home offers an excellent opportunity to schedule a secur\u00ad ity survey at the residence. The premise upon which the security survey program is based states that prospective burglars are attracted to locations where security deficiencies can be observed. The security survey is considered to be a highly effective means for enabling the average citizen to recognize and correct inadequacies in home security before they are observed and acted upon by a prospective burglar. PROGRAM Goals of the typical security survey program are virtually synonymous with other \"target harden\u00ad ing\" efforts. These goals might be summarized as follows: 1. Delay any prospective intruder through the installation of appropriate locks on doors and win\u00ad dows and through observance of fundamental security precautions. 2 . Deter the prospective burglar through installation of outdoor lighting, removal of screening and landscape features that might permit unobserved entry, or use of devices that give the home an occupied appearance when it is empty. V-13 , 3. Deny the burglar any reward for an illegal entry by keeping valuables out of sight and well pro\u00ad t'ected in areas that cannot be easily violated. 4. Detect any illegal entry into the home through installation of alarm systems, if appropriate. OPERATION While police departments in various parts of the nation conduct security surveys in ways that best s('l.tisfy their own local needs and are compatible with local resources, a prototype such as the follow\u00ad ing is generally recognizable. Whether the initial contact is made by the police, a volunteer, or the concerned citizen, a security survey is scheduled at sonie future date at a time that is mutually acceptable. Frequently, security surveys will be requested by residents in a neighborhood that is experiencing current difficulties with burglary or other forms of illegal entry. When it is possible to group surveys by neighborhood, by all means do so to avoid unnecessary travel time on the part of the inspector. The inspector-who may be a police officer, a special service technician, or a train.ed volunteer-arrives at the location with crime prevention literature and an approved home securIty checklist. The inspector is accompanied by the homeowner through the residence in order to obse~e anticipated security deficiencies. When deficiencies ar~ observe?, they are rec~r?ed o~ th~ chec~hst. Simultaneously, security weaknesses are pointed out to the resIdent, and specIfIc advIce IS provIded to enable the resident to make appropriate improvements. Frequently, the inspector brings engravi~g equipment to the survey site in order to ~ark ~roperty designated by the owner. Alternatively, the marking tool may be borrowed by the resIdent In order to mark his property after the survey has been completed. In the best security survey programs, the security checklist used during the survey is then filed in a safe place for a period ranging from 60 days to six months, at which time a \"follow-up\" contact is made to check on .compliance with recommendations. It is the responsibility of the private citizen .to carry out recommended improvements at his own discretion. It is not in the role of the securIty survey inspector to enforce compliance with recommendations, but the \"follow-up\" contact may be an important impetus to encourage citizen compliance, particularly if inactivity has resulted from simple procrastination or indecision. VAmATIONS Security survey programs are normally divided into three general types, which are identified below: Residential Security Surveys. The inspection is conducted here to identify and correct oppor\u00ad tunities for illegal entry onto residential premises. Inspection includes a tour of the interior of the V-14 \" , . \", residence and surrounding grounds, if any. Recommendations are provided on the spot to a con\u00ad cerned resident. The person conducting the survey mayor may not assist in making some actual im\u00ad provements. Use of volunteers as residential survey inspectors is very common. Commercial Security Survey. An inspection is made of commercial properties, ranging from storefront establishments and office building suites to industrial or manufacturing firms. The pur\u00ad pose of the survey is to minimize opportunities for illegal entry and to reduce opportunities for theft. This might focus on opportunities for shoplifting or removal of heavy equipment or supplies from the premises. It will be obvious that a degree of specialized knowledge about business loss problems-in addi\u00ad tion to general security fundamentals-is helpful in conducting a useful commercial security survey. For this reason, a greater degree of specialization is helpful when available, and the use of volunteers is correspondingly diminished, except in circumstances where a volunteer brings needed skills to the program. Public Building Security Surveys. Inspection is made of public buildings within: the community. The purpose of the survey is to reduce opportunities for theft and illegal entry\" and also to minimize the opportunity for vandalism or unauthorized use of property or grounds. Locations might include schools, government offices, controlled assembly areas, and other public property of a local govern\u00ad ment. Since virtually all improvements to these properties must be documented through bureaucratic channels, the security survey must be conducted in a \"professional\" manner, with full attention to technicalities that might obstruct compliance with recommendations. Volunteers are infrequently used for this type of survey, since a great deal of time and expertise are required to complete a single survey. VOLUNTEERS Older volunteers have provided invaluable support for hundreds of security survey programs. Some of the services commonly perf~rmed by older volunteers are listed below: To promote a security survey \"campaignH through distribution of literature, either door-to\u00ad \u00b7door or through the intervening support of a community organization or civic association. To carry out telephone surveys of selected neighborhoods to encourage scheduling of security surveys during the times when inspectors can be used efficiently. To staff a telephone watch maintained to answer calls from concerned citizens who want to schedule security surveys or obtain other crime prevention information. ~ To assist with the routine paperwork that is involved in the scheduling of security surveys of all types. To conduct residential security surveys, often in connection with other crime prevention activi\u00ad ties, such as implementation of an Operation Identification program. V-IS 'I I 'I To conduct commercial. security surveys, usually in areas or types of activities that are familiar; to the volunteer as aresult of career experience. To train additional volunteers in the proper methods of conducting a residential security survey. To maintain files of site surve-~Is and to make appropriate \"follow up\" contacts with citizens to check on compliance with recommendations made during the surveys. LIMITATIONS Large scale use of security surveys for target hardening and dissemination of cri~e prevention in\u00ad formation nearly always implies utilization of volunteers to conduct surveys. WIthout volunteer assistance the security survey program normally becomes a service almost exclusively used by the business ~ommunity. Residential sl.;!curity surveys represent too great a drain on available police manpower unless supplemented by vohmteers. The security survey volunteer, however, must be a trained volunteer. Before deciding to make widespread u~~ of residential security survey, the police department will want to consider the limita\u00ad tions inherent in this type of volunteer program. Some of these are listed below: Transportation. Volunteers may be expected to donate time or make it available at minimum expense, but the cost of visiting locations throughout the jurisdiction will have to be borne by the department, or transportation made available for the volunteer. Recruit selection. Volunteers used for security surveys must be selected very carefully. They must be intelligent, alert individuals who are capable of making realistic judgments about security needs. Furthermore, the volunteer's character must be appropriate to the role of representing the police department within the homes of private citizen.,. The department must expend a certain amount of time to carefully screen volunteer candidates who would perform this sensitive task. Training. Volunteer survey candidates must be trained. Recognition of security weaknesses constitutes the core of this training, but development of interpersonal communication skills is nearly as important. Ultimately, the fact that the performance of the survey inspector may be an important influence-pro or con-in obtaining compliance is the bottom line. Particular at\u00ad tention must be paid to developing a realistic approach to risk management. Security recom\u00ad mendations made by the inspector must be compatible with the value of property being pro\u00ad tected and the ability of the owner to pay for security. Recommending expensive alarm systems to low-income housing residents is not helpful. This training time must be expended at the outset of any successful program. Compliance data becomes difficult to handle. Unless sOI?eone accepts personal res~on.\u00ad sibility for maintaining survey records, the normal tenden,cy IS to ~rad~allY d~wngrade pnon\u00ad ties for handling this material, leaving it vulnerable to any mterr~ptton m r,outme: O~e study of security surveys determined that less than 20 percent of surveymg agenCIes mamtamed com\u00ad pliance rate data, and within that 20 percent, definitions of compliance differed .. ' V-16 f I .-\\ , . / Evaluation is difficult. Lacking uniform compliance data, the effectiveness of security survey programs remains unclear. One national evaluation effort (1976) ended by recommenditig that the Law Enforcement Assistan~e Administration not support a further evaluation of security ~urveys alone. Instead the fundmg agency was urged to evaluate the combined results of secur\u00ad Ity survey programs, Operation Identification, and crime reporting programs. OPTIMAL BENEFIT EXAMPLES Lik~ Operation Id~nt~fication, a sec~rity survey program apparently offers the greatest benefit wh~~ ~ncorporated wIthm.a broader cnme.prevention effort. .This may include residential security actlVl,ttes as well as techmques more .apphcable to commerCIal locations. Since the scope of the ~ecunty survey depends upon the serVIces of volunteers or service technicicpJs who must be invited mto the hOlpes or businesses of citizens, the public acceptance generated by a broad-based crime prevention campaign may be critical for the program's success. Some examples of ways in which the security survey has been used are listed below: !he S~att1e, yv as~ington program, I~~ludmg residenttal secunty InSpectIOns, m response to a citywide survey which indicated that CItizens were more concerned about burglary than any other crime. The program utilized six paid ,\"organizers\" and several \"home service technicians\" who visited residences to make securIty surveys and to mark property with engraving tools. Participants in the security survey program were encouraged to become active in a Block Watch program that was simultaneously developed. Post-campaign data indicated a 48-to-61 percent reduction in burglaries at inspected households . The Co~tage Grove, Oregon Police Department conducted au extensive crime prevention pro\u00ad gram rumed particularly at senior citizens in the community. For this program, four older volunteers were recruited and given special training. These trained individuals then conducted a door-to-door campaign in which crime prevention literature was distributed and residential ~ecurity surve~s w~~e conducted, In addition to identifying security deficiencies, inspectors also mfo~med semor cIttzens, of the many local, state, and federal agencies in the area that provided serVIces or emergency rud to older residents. Survey reports were filed, and one follow-up call was made to each surveyed location. A slightly different variation of the security survey was conducted for the Lincoln Guild Hous\u00ad ing Corporation, Manhattan, New York City. In this case, through the instrument of an active tenant-association, which held meetings to encourage safety rules for residents, a security surv~y w,as ,conducted in a large apartment building and contiguous outdoor areas. The survey resulted m Improvements made by the building management, including the addition of outdoor lighting and restrictions to free building entry. .

Koepsell, Commission NCJRS accession number: 09900.00.041481 This report appeared originally as an article in Crime Prevention Review, Vol. 4, No.2 (January 1977). The purpose of the research was to assess information and prior studies of the security survey program. The report focuses on how security surveys are conducted, how success might be defined in terms of the program goals, and how success of a security survey program might be measured. Certain implications' based on existing knowledge are identified, and attention is drawn to new areas for research that would be necessary to support or reject these conclusions.

The National Crime Prevention Institute (NCPI) regards crime prevention as \". . . an elegantly simple and direct ap\u00ad proach that protects the potential victim from criminal attack by anticipating the possibility of at\u00ad tack and eliminating or reducing the opportunity for it to occur.\" Crime prevention, according to NCPI, is a \"direct\" crime control method, as contrasted with in\u00ad direct methods such as delinquency diversion, apprehension, court action, imprisonment, and the example set by those activities. Others contend that it is difficult to draw a fine distinction between the concepts of crime prevention and crime control. ,Crime prevention education could theoretically include Operation Identification and security surveys, as well as neighborhood surveillance and patrol programs. Such a classification, however, would be purely academic. The purpose of this section is to identify programs that are limited to dissemination of information -as expressed in literature, by a speaker, a film, or demonstration\u00ad and distinguish that kind of program from one where the citizen is expected to be more than an in\u00ad terested audience. For instance, the end result of crime prevention education may indeed be to stimulate a citizen to take certain target hardening measures or become involved in some cooperative means of protection, but the education program itself focuses only on dissemination of useful infor\u00ad mation. Both NCPI and the Texas Crime Prevention Institute favor a definition of crime prevention based on the philosophy of dealing with crime in a proactive manner. This widely accepted definition characterizes crime prevention as \"the anticipation, the recognition, and the appraisal of a crime risk, and the initiation of some action to remove or reduce it.\" Crime prevention education programs work to increase citizen awareness of risk, and provide in\u00ad formation that can be used to reduce the risk or eliminate it. PROGRAM GOALS Goals of a crime prevention education program may be expressed at different levels, some of which are itemized below: 1. To distribute X pieces of literature to X number of households. A purely quantitative goal of this kind might also be expressed as: to give X number of appearances before X number of V-19 ,/ :! ;,1 ! H H iI 11 II /1 !\"1 \\1 :' :1 :1 H j i ~ i ;1 'I 'I '! \" :i 2. )} community groups, or X number of films or demonstrations at X number of schools. Purely quantitative goals do not sound very idealistic, but a tangible, comparable figure is produced that relates directly to less easily evaluated goals of the education program. To encourage increased membership in more participatory types of crime prevention pro\u00ad grams, such as Operation'\" Identification, security surveys, Block Watch, Neighborhood Watch, or other surveillance programs. This goal could be expressed in more general terms as increasing citizen awareness of risk. However, membership figures in related crime prevention programs provides a more tangible goal, although results are obviously affected by the content of the participatory program itself. 3. To reduce citizen apprehension about crime in the community. Apprehension of this type is measureable before and after a crime prevention campaign by use of a simple community survey. When evaluating goal achievement, one must be careful not to measure citizen awareness of crime, because this should actually increase. Reduction is sought in feelings of helplessness, frustration, and vulnerability before the perceived crime risk. 4. 5. To reduce the incidence of a specific type of crime in the community, such as rape, burglary, auto theft, etc. The education program, of course, must be designed to emphasize defenses against this particular type of crime. To reduce overall crime rates in an affected jurisdiction. The crime prevention education pro\u00ad gram, in this case, is assumed to be a contributory factor in goal achievement. OPERATION Crime prevention education programs include hundreds of variations in form and content. To some extent, however, ,the operation phases or segments of this model program type can be dis\u00ad cussed in terms of the following general steps: Supply. The :program leader must obtain sufficient quantities of literature, films, or other pro\u00ad gram. aids from a dependable source of supply. This phase includes recruitment of speakers or dem~!nstraton: and acquisition of any special equipment that will be required to implement the progiram. \\ Support. Sources of financial assistance in the community, sources of volunteers, persons or. organizations who can help with mailing, packaging, deliveries, p(~vi8ion of meeting rooms or other facilities should be contacted early in the planning st~ges of the program. Promotion. To some extent promotion is the program when goals are expressed in terms of pu.blic awareness, public attitudes, or public responslveness. No form of communication should be neglected if possible. Possible options include billboards, posters, bumper stickers, decals, newspaper advertising, newspaper editorial cover:!ge, radio spots, and announcements made at meetings of civic groups and service clubs. V-20 f I \" \\ .... \" / Distribution. With reference to crime prevention education literature, such distribution may in\u00ad clude door.,to-door campaigns; pickUp racks at libraries, bus stations, and cooperating businesses; distribution to members of organizations; or direct mail contacts, Demonstration. When the education program includes public speaking engagements, film show\u00ad ings, or demonstrations of recommended techniques or methods at public gatherings, all such ac\u00ad tivities must be carefully scheduled so as to coincide with available supplies and/or volunteers. VOLUNTEERS Volunteers are an almost indispensible element in a successful crime prevention education pro\u00ad gram. Very few police departments, if any, are in a position to do all that could (and should) be done without using the services of interested citizen volunteers. As always, older volunteers prove to be resourceful and dependable sources of assistance. Many of the ~ervices performed by volunteers during an education program duplicate roles per\u00ad formed and already described under Operation Identification and Security Survey programs. In ad\u00ad dition to those functions, volunteers may also be helpful in the following ways. Volunteers may review literature, advertisements, catalogues, magazine files, etc., in order to identify possible program aids, such as films, advertisements, and so on, which can be selected by the program leader. If the volunteer is knowledgeable in the program area, he may actually review sample films, brochures, posters, etc., to assist in the selection process and weed out inappropriate materials. During the critical promotion period of the educational pr.ogram, volunteers can assist in the distribution of posters and decal reminders. Program promotion must be done skillfully. Your \"adv:,:i, ~isement\" will be competing with the best nationally advertised products for the atten\u00ad tion oi:your audience. In terms of professional polish, your local materials may come up short in this competition. Your big advantage is quantity. With good volunteer support, your message can reach everyone in the community several times a day. Do not neglect the possible assistance of other city departments, such as signs displayed on sanitation trucks or transit vehicles. Volunteers can dt~tribute these materials or place them for display. Good speakers are' hard to find, but many volunteers can handle a carefully structured presen\u00ad tation. For example, it may require an experienced police officer to give a ~O-minute speech and respond to a group's questions. However, a volunteer could deliver a five-minute introduction to a film or audio-visual program. Any following questions that ranged beyond the volunteer's own experience could be recorded and referred to a police officer for response. LIMITATIONS Few unexpected limitations are forthcoming with reference to the use of volunteers for clime prevention education programs. Among those occa~Jonally listed are the following:\u00bb V ... S kers ~ho participate in the program must be willing to travel to diverse location.s, usually \\. 'd~;~g evening hours. Occasionally there I~as ?een some hesitancy among volunteers m accept- ing assignments in areas where crime pre\\ ~ntIon programs are most needed. . Again with reference to public speakers, there has been some difficulty maintai~i~g in~erest over the course of a lengthy campaign. If possible, this situation c~n be averte k y ~smfh a larger number of volunteer speakers, eac~ of wh~m works fewer assignments, or eepmg e education campaign limited to a shorter tIme penod. Except in a purely quantitative goal measurement, evaluation of crim~ prevention educatio? is d'ff' It Numerous additional factors contribute to the outcome antIcipated by t~e educatIOn I ICum\u00b7 and these factors often cloud the impact of the crime prevention ed~catIon program progr:a , al th d t' program IS probably best it~df.

One ~r~gram m thiS field IS known as SAFE. The word is an acronym representing four \"rules\" for aVOldmg rape. -Secure the environment. -Avoid vulnerable circumstances. -Flee any threatening situation. -Engage the attacker physically if necessary. Considerable controversy surrounds the question of when ~nd how to. physic~llY. engage an at\u00ad tacker if necessary. Some rape victims report that physical resistance was Impo~slble, others re~ort that resistance caused the attacker to become more violent. Most rape preventIOn programs pace great~r emphasis on the first three rules. Volunteers can be particularly effective in rape prevention programs, particularly. if a ~ol~nteer is o a former victim While a volunteer of this type may occasionally offer adVice t ~t IS ~ues\u00ad ~l~nable or overly ag~ressive, that can be quickly put i?to per~p~~tive by an at~ending polIce officer.

V-22 .-\" . \" number of rules and warnings are itemized for the purpose of protecting students against sex of\u00ad fenders. The officers then demonstrate self defense measures that can be taken during an emergency. Auto The/t. Several police departments periodically carry out campaigns aimed at educating the public about the risk of auto theft. The.campaign usually includes placing a \"ticket\" on the wind\u00ad shield (under a wiper blade) of any car left unlocked at the curb or in parking lots. The content of the ticket varies, but one of the more popular is headed \"Gotcha!\" and refers to the fact that the ticketer-if he were a thief-could have stolen the car. Volunteers from numerous community groups are used to distribute tickets. Foreign Language Groups. In major cities, police often are confronted with persons who do not speak the English language, and are therefore at a disadvantage when it is necessary to report either a crime or fears about potential crime. One positive approach to this problem is to provide members of a foreign language commmunity with a specialized English vocabulary list that can be used to report crimes. The Baltimore, Maryland Police Department has developed a pictograph that can be used to iden\u00ad tify key features of an assailant or suspect. This pictograph is distributed to Korean businessmen. It illustrates various physical characteristics and identifies each by Korean and English words. Volunteers within the Korean community assist in identification of businessmen needing assistance and in distribution of the reporting aid. Rural Crime. Special problems presented by rural crime investigations and special difficulties in establishing effective preventive measures have led to recognition of this special crime category dur\u00ad ing recent years. Some wide-ranging citizen patrol progra!11s have begun in rural counties, and crime prevention education programs are being developed to meet the needs of rural citizens. The American Farm Bureau is one national organization that operates a program to reduce rural crime. Hands Up. Another volunteer program active on the national level is the \"Hands Up\" program, which.is conducted by the General Federation of Women's Clubs. Over 1,200 clubs are involved in more than 4,000 projects, many of which would be described as crime prevention education pro\u00ad grams. The national effort seeks to increase awareness of the citizen's role in crime reduction and to encourage formation of local action groups to recommend and implement crime prevention programs. Crime Prevention Coalition. In November, 1979, the Crime Prevention Coalition launched an ambitious crime prevention information program. The campaign included advertising on television and radio as well as print media and outdoor advertising. The effort is a joint undertaking of the Advertising Council, Inc., the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, and the Law Enforce\u00ad ment Assistance Administration (LEAA). The campaign features a trench-coated dog who advises citizens to \"take a bite out of crime.\" Citizens are encouraged to ask for crime prevention informa\u00adtion.

SPECIAL RESOURCES Numerous organizations sponsor national programs in the area of crime prevention. Space limita\u00ad tions preclude a complete listing here; however, some organizations that haven(!t already been men- tioned in this section are listed below: American Legion Kiwanis International National Alliance for Safer Cities U.S. Jaycees National Council of Senior Citizens 1 / . , .-'\\ i / Frequently a community organization, a newspaper, or a leading bank in a community may offer mone~ary reward~ for information supplied by anonymous callers. The crime reporting system exists essentially to receive and make record of these calls, and to direct any earned reward into the hands of t~e caller without compromising his or her anonymity. Some crime reporting systems which pro\u00ad tect mformants in this way are operated within a police department by sworn police officers. Others .are operated almost entirely by private or volunteer organizations which relay useful information to the police. In this section we are concerned primarily with those organizations that utilize volunteer services. . V-25 ; ~ .. r \\ r , . \" \" \" f t :' CRIME REPORTING SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION In contrast to crime prevention activities discussed thus far in this section, crime reporting systems normally come into oper~tion after a crime has been committed. The focus of activity is on pro\u00ad viding assistance that will lead to the arrest and conviction of a suspect. With reference to the use of television to promot? and publicize crime prevention education pro\u00ad grams, it should be noted that a series of TV \"spots\" emphasizing various crime reporting and prevention messages has been developed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Infor\u00ad mation about acquisition and use of these spots may be obtained from the Public Affairs Division of the IACP, Eleven Firsttield Road, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20760. Crime reporting systems are known under several names. They are often described as secret witness programs, informant protection systems, or tipster incentive programs. All share the pur\u00ad pose of increasing the flow of information from citizens in the community to the police as an aid to law enforcement. II PROGRAM GOALS 1. To encourage increased crime reporting by citizens within a community, particularly with reference to identification of suspects associated with selected crimes. 2. To provide a safe outlet for persons in the community who want to share information about criminals, crimes, evidence, or criminal intentions of associates. 3. To increase arrest and conviction rates in a community by attracting large numbers of pro\u00ad tected informants into the secret reporting system. 4. To provide an instrument through which local businessmen and other volunteers can take positive action to improve law enforcement in their own community. V-27 , .. ' , , , OPERATION The successful crime reporting progra~ -whether o! ~ot ~ fi~ancial reward is offered for information -is preservation of the anonymity of any partlclpatmg mformant. Only one lapse in security is required for the entire program to suffer a major setback. This is true because informants may choose to participate in the reporting program for any number of reaso~s not related to financial reward: sense of duty, guilt, contrition, etc. The informant, however, Will not risk exposure in a flawed program, and will quickly drop out if he feels threatened. Perhaps the most common technique used to preserve anonymity is as~ignment of cod~ n.umbers to callers. The following operational example is based upon the experIence of OperatIon BUST (Business United to Stop Trouble) in Baltimore, Maryland. Operation BUST is supported financially by a coalition of 10 trade associations which rep~es~nt various types of small business enterprises in the city. Small bu~i~ess O\\~rners ~ad long been vIctIm\u00ad ized by robberies and other crimes, and they wanted to take posItIve actIOn to Improve law enforce\u00ad ment. Business represented in the supporting coalition include liquor stores, grocery stores, taverns, and restaurants. One salaried director and office space are budgeted for the program, and all other participants are volunteers. In addition to the crime reporting system, Operation BUST also operates a multi-faceted crime prevention education program, A special telephone line has been publicized to receive anonymous calls related to crime reporting. Callers simply dial 685-BUST. A first-time caller is typically nervous and overly con~erned that he may say something revealing that might make identification possible. To overcome thiS natural fear, the volunteer who answers the telephone asks, \"Would you like to have an identifying number?\" After assigning a number to the caller, it is explained that any information will be recorded and brought to the attention of police investigators. The caller is in~tructed t~ call.~ac~ after two weeks to learn whether or not a reward has been earned. The caller IS told to IdentIfy himself by the as- signed number only at the time that the second call is made. Information provided by the informant is then recorded by the volunteer. W~ether or not a reward is merited cannot be stated in advance. Nor can any dollar amount be negotIated. It may be mentioned that information leading to an arrest for a major crime-such as armed robbery-usually involves a substantial amount. The decision to pay a reward and the dollar amount of any reward paid is technically the respon\u00ad sibility of a leadership committee. In practice, a police department liaison recommends whether or not to pay and how much, and that recommendation is nearly always followed. Payoffs are made by a two-man team consisting of one BUST board mem?er a?d o~e. poli~e of\u00ad ficer. Frequently the informant simply stops by the office at a pre-arranged tIme, IdentIfies himself by number only, and picks up a payment in cash. No receipt is .re.quired. O~casio~allY payo~fs are made in a park or on a street corner, but always a two-man team IS mvolved, mcludmg one pollee of- ficer. No one ever learns the tipster's name. With some variation in the manner of initial contact and in procedures for making payment of earned rewards, this basic operation characterizes most crime reporting systems now in use. V-28 ~{)~\"-~~~;;\"'_\"\"\"\"''''_>'''''~~~-\":''.~'''- ~ ___ ,.*~'-... .\"\".: \\ .-)1 II :) VOLUNTEERS The c.rime reporting system is essentially a volunteer activity. Considerable police guidance must be ~rovld4ld at the outset of the program, and close police cooperation is needed to preserve the in\u00ad , tegnty of the system. However, once established, the crime reporting system is almost entirely in\u00ad dependen~. The salaried staff,.if any, assumes the problems of fund raising and program manage\u00ad ment, whIle telephones are staffed almost entirely by volunteers. Older volunteers have proven to be particularly valuable. Many are knowledgeable about specific problems of sponsoring businesses and can suggest preventive measures that might be recommended by program staff. With reference to the telephone watch, older volunteers adjust well to the long h~urs of inactivity that are sometimes necessary, and they often prove to be tactful, perceptive inter\u00ad viewers. LIMITATIONS Care must be taken that the secret witness line does not become merely a complaint vehicle for citizens who \"do not want to get involved.\" Use of the special telephone line for this purpose is a common problem, and must be handled tactfully but firmly by the person receiving the call. Complaints about noise, loiterers, and other currenfproblems should be directed to the normal police call number. Volunteers who become\u00b7involved in an interesting activity such as this may tend to gossip about their experiences. This is entirely acceptable, so long as it is done with discretion. Volunteers must be warned not to repeat anything which may tend in any way-to identify an informant or to in any way obstruct or interfere with an ongoing investigation. Volunteers .'lhould tell their tales in general terms that cannot be linked to any specific investigation. Crime reporting activity is very uneven. It is affected by publicity, currei~ events, and numerous other factors. There may be long periods of boredom, which can be frustrating to unprepared volunteers. OPTIMAL BENEFIT EXAMPLES One of the nation's more ambitious priVate crime reporting systems is operated by the Albu\u00ad querque, New Mexico Crime Stoppers. Like other programs of this type, the Albuquerque group maintains a special telephone line to accept anonymous calls. Reports of criminal and suspicious activity are accepted. The program is funded by contributions from the public and is controlled by an 18-member civilian board of directors. This board establishes the amount of reward to be paid to informants, if any. The Albuquerque program, however, goes farther than passiveiy awaiting calls. In the case of unsolved crimes, the group provides selected case reports to n~wspapers, which pro\u00ad vide additional publicity. Sixty-second public service announcements are prepared for local radio stations. These announcements erwuurage witnesses or informants to call the special number with \\\\ V-29 ._-------------y ,.,c \" , I ' '. ,,'. \"\". . \". .. information pertaining to a particular case, A local television station participates by s~reening a two-minute segment on the \"crime of the week,\" also ,urging witnesses or informants to use the anonymous call number. The TIP program, which was organized in Tampa, Florida during the early 1970s, has been im\u00ad itated successfully in a large number of cities throughout the nation. TIP .stands ~or Turn I~ a Pusher. It consists essentially of a special toll-free telephone number that 1S set aS1de to receIve anonymous calls from witnesses and informants. As its name indicates, TIP was originally aim\u00ad ed squarely at drug dealers. Supportive publicity in the community drew p.ublic attention to the community's problem with narcotics, and a concerted effort was made to Improve law enforce\u00ad ment in this targeted area of concern. In Houston, Texas, a local newspaper, The Houston Post, initiated a secret witnes.s program that stimulated crime reporting throughout the city. The newspaper offered relatIvely large sums as rewards for information ($4,000 for a murder arrest, $3,000 for rape or armed robbery). While the newpaper was in a unique position to publicize its o~n pr.ogra~, v~ry close cooperation was required with police officials in order to assure that ne1ther mvestIgatIOns nor trials were compromised by the release of sensitive information. Crime reporting by children is a special problem. Rarely will a child use ~v.e~. a protected anonymous telephone line to report a crime. One program that opens possIbIlIties for com\u00ad munication in this area is the \"Helping Hand\" program. Helping Hand, like the Block Parent and similar child protection programs, is usually classified under neighborhood crime preven\u00ad tion activities. However it should be noted that maintenance of well-marked homes where children know they can ~btain help in an emergency, also contributes to crime reporting. The child may report suspicious situations or persons more freely at these \"official\" stations than at home before parents.

It contains a description of a community radio watch program at Palo Alto, California. With an investment of only eight police man-hours p~r month, the department has added 66 observers to its ranks. Cab drivers, municipal employees, and Citizen Band (CB) radio operators (both club members and individuals), are members of the program. Each participant is briefed on reporting procedures and is presented with a logo decal. Monthly meetings are held. This type of program overlaps to some degree a classification as a mobile patrol, but its initial thrust was to stimulate crime reporting of all kinds.

Consequences of reportiqg and. not reporting are examined. The report concludes that older citizens who do report crime are p~ople who seem to be able to exercise control over their life situations and who retain a sense of social responsibilty. On the other hand, older citizens who do not report crime appear to be more withdrawn from the system and more isolated from the society. Interview responses of 466 persons beyond the age of 55 who live within the geographic boundaries of Dallas, Texas provide the substance of this report.

V-31 ------ ............. \"\"',--.-..-------------~-\"'.-- I / NEIGHBORHOOD SURVEILLANCE AND PATROLS DESCRIPTION Although it is understood that neighborhood-based crime control nearly always includes crime prevention education and target-hardening, neighborhood-based surveillance and patrol programs are distinguished by their reliance upon collective means of protection. Each member is expected to take appropriate measures for individual protection, but the true value of the group surpasses the sum of individual efforts. Surveillance and patrol programs rely on cooperative group action to make entire city blocks, apartment houses, suburban developments, or parts of a rural county less vulnerable to crime. Typically, a neighborhood surveillance or patrol group is formed in a neighborhood, that has ex\u00ad perienced recent criminal activity which has aroused the public. Frequently, the patrol group is organized within the context of an existing community service dub, a homeowners' or tenants' association, a PTA, or some other relatively stable organization. In addition, many groups are formed from \"scratch\" in reac;tion to local increases in criminal activity. Professionals within the criminal justice system tend to regard citizen patrols and surveillance net\u00ad works with mixed feelings. To the degree that crime reporting is enhanced and citizens become more sensitive(to their own security needs, the volunteer groups are generally favored. Some law enforce\u00ad ment lea:ders have gone much farther, actively encouraging volunteer groups that offer direct assistanc~\\to th,~police crime fighting mission. On the other hand, police officers also are skeptical about the ieatcontribution made by such groups, since they are typically short-lived, represent some danger of vigilantism, and tend rather to displace criminal activity than to truly eliminate it. From the point of view of the volunteer participant, of course, displacement of crime from his own neighborhood is sufficient reward for the effort. PROGRAM GOALS 1.

A ave ee :i The building patrol most closely approximates the fixed surveillance. In some cases it is limited to restricting access to an apartment building. This is accomplished by posting a \"registration\" desk in the lobby, which is staffed by a volunteer. Building patrols may also systematically make observa\u00ad tions of hallways, stairwells, and adjoining grounds. Both foot patrols and mobile patrols are normally walked or driven in pairs. The patrol team car\u00ad ries whistles, walkie-talkies, or CB radios in order to communicate with a third volunteer at a base station. This patrol seeks out observable suspicious behavior. When observed, such behavior is reported to the base station. It mayor may not be relayed to police for response. \\,~ Obviously, the patrol function represents a higher degree of organization than the fixed surveillance network. Success depends on the ability to recruit and maintain a large number of active participants who are willing to put in from two to 12 hours per week on patrol. Typically, patrol groups consist of a very small nucleus of two or three very interested participants, who put in many hours of work, and a larger number of \"pool\" members who assist to a lesser degree. The citizen patrol group may be formed without any prior contact with the police department. However, the need to establish a two-way radio command center and the opportunity for financial assistance quickly brings the new patrol organization into contact with the police department. A degree of training by the police, iinot direct control, is essential if the police agency is to realize the benefits of the community organization without risking its worst limitations. Patrol members must be taught to report criminal and suspicious activities without intervening in any police response. The neighborhood patrol, at its best, is a very ambitious community response. With proper support, it can be an extremely valuable crime prevention program. VOLUNTEERS Neighborhood surveillance and patrol programs may be entirely volunteer activities. Professional ! police input is most effective in ter(ms of volunteer training and liaison services~ Older citizens have proven to be particularly valuable Yc!unteers in neighborhood organizations. Some functions per\u00ad formed by older volunteers are listed: Neighborhood surveillance groups are particularly fortunate to have an older citizen, preferably retired, as the focal point for a blockwatching program. Since retired persons are often at home and can be expected to have leisure time available, they can perform effectiveiy as observers for much longer period~ of time than younger volunteers, whose time and atten\u00ad tion are demanded by numerous family responsibilities. An older resident can be designated to accept deliveries for persons who are away from home. This avoids the possibility that the merchandise might be stolen or that it might advertise the absence of the homeowner. An older volunteer can keep house keys for youngsters or other family members in the event of ~m unexpected or emergency absence at a neighborhood home. . \" Being familiar with the normal daily routine of the neighborhood, an older resident can easily observe and make a record of any unusual truck traffic (which might later be linked to residen- tial burglaries). .. , ! 11 \" Similarly, the older resident is alert to any door-to-door ~olicitors in the area (who might be looking for opportunities to burglarize an unoccupied resIdence). In neighborhood patrol groups older members have provided excellent support as radio monitors or control station operators, receiving messages from other members who are conduc- ting the foot or vehicle patrol. Older volunteers frequently staff a volunteer \"security desk\" as part of a building pat~.ol. In addition to registering visitors (which inhibits opportunistic criminals), many cIder reSIdents find the security desk involvement a rewarding social experience. OPTIMAL BENEFIT EXAMPLES Literally hundreds of examples are available that might illustrate beneficial use of older volunteers in neighborhood surveillance and patrol programs.

While neighborhood surveillance and patrol groups offer great promise in the crime prevention fIeld, t?ey must be caref~lly nurtured and guided by police professionals if their full potential is to be realIzed. In an operational sense, little or no police manpower is required. However a certain a~ount of t~m~ f~r liaison services, guidance, and feedback is advised by agencies with ex~erience in thIS area. LImItations to be expected are listed below: Surveillance networks can grow too large for their own good. Evaluative studies have revealed that the effectiveness of the network seems to relate more to the degree of involvement of .~. ~~~bers rat~~r t~an to overall size of membership. Very large programs that require only ~rumal pa~t~cIPatIOn from each member may also result in mimimal improvement in overall CrIme condItIons. On the other hand, evidence suggests that smaller programs that demand greater i~puts from participating members can have a more positive and lasting effect on the commumty. ?ert~inly the greatest limitation of any patrol program is a danger of tending toward vigilant\u00ad Ism If the .vol~mteers are left unguided by professional police officers. Following are some general guldelmes that have'been established with reference to citizen patrols. It should be noted at the outs~t, however, that the presence of responsible older citizens within the group often creates a sti~bilizing element. 1. Patrol members should be at least 18 years old. 2. Patrol members should be issued personal identification cards by the local law enforcement agency. ' 3. Patrol members who operate radio equipment should possess appropriate FCC licenses. 4. Automobiles used by patrol members should be identified in some obvious manner. 5. Patrol member,S should not be permitted to carry weapons of any kind. 6.

The protective senior escort service, for instance, is designed to respond directly to the fears of older citizens concerning various forms of street crime. The basic idea is to provide a companion, who will accompany the older person during trips to the grocery, the bank, the doctor's office, or some other destination. The presence of the companion is expected to deter any attack upon the older person that might otherwise have been contemplated. Older citizens are justifiably afraid of street crime. One study of a successful prevention program in Wilmington, Delaware revealed that crimes committed against the elderly occurred as often away from a residence as in or near it. Types of crime included pursesnatching, robbery, muggings, and sex crimes, although the most common offense was pursesnatching. Crimes were usually committed during the day, and they usually involved white, female victims. The existence of a protective escort service can be an effective deterrent, according to the same study. Incidences of crime against older persons dropped 21.5 percent during a two-year period, which included implementation of the escort service as well as other crime prevention education pro\u00ad grams. PROGRAM GOALS 1. To reduce the incidences of street crime directed against older citizens. 2. To diminish fear of street crime and the effects of that fear, such as severely restricted mobility, among older segments of the population. 3. To involve the youth of the community, a population group frequently perceived as threaten\u00ad ing, into a protective relationship with older citizens. 4. To develop a more cohesive sense of group membership among older citizens in the com\u00ad munity through organization of this form of cooperative protective service. \\ \\\\ h OPERATION There are two distinctly different, types of protective escort service programs for older persons. One utilizes the services of community youth as companions for older residents. Teenagers may either be assigned one or more older \"clients\" to assist and protect as needed, or a pool of young V\u00b741 escorts may be held available on request. The second form of escort s~rvice i~volves organ~zati~? of male members of the senior citizens group into a volunteer escort servIce, WhIch may function el.her as an \"on call\" service or as a form of neighborhood patrol. The program involving community youth as escorts is probably the more popul~r at the pr~sent time perhaps because of available funds now apportioned under ComprehenSIve EducatIo~al Trai~ing Act (CETA) resources. These funds are.available to hire unemployed yo~?g persons durmg summer months so long as useful training is provided in a job situation. Several Cities have taken ad\u00ad vantage of this opportunity to recruit young persons into a protective escort service for older per- sons. Based on a program of this type, which involved 95 \"junior police cadets\" in the ci~~ ~f Detroit, Michigan the following training might be provided to prospective escorts: sensItlVlty to the police offlCer m the commumty; recogmtIon of cardiac and breathing problems; and crime prevention responsibilities. In the Detroit experience, cadets would escort older citizens to shopping. center~, medical facilities, and banks. In addition, cadets served as monitors at various commumty serVIce centers and churcht~s where they could be helpful if needed. Some cadets were assigned to mak~ t~lephone calls or hOUl~e visits to older citizens in the community simply for the purpose of provIdmg some reinforcement against depression or loneliness. This type of program obviously exceeded the goals of a simple crime prevention patrol or companion service, which was the immediate benefit sought by the older persons who participated. The alternative form of protective senior escort service is probably best known through .the ex\u00ad perience of the Wilmington, Delaware volunteers. In this form, older ~en are or~~mzed as volunteer escorts or patrol members who accompany older women during trIps. In addition to an escort on foot, there is also available a vehicle patrol, and women are offered rides to or from various points in the neighborhood. VOLUNTEERS Youth patrols are not really volunteer programs, since all of the young participants are actually being paid for their time through CETA or some comparable source of funding. Considerable atten\u00ad tion must be paid to appropriate training and assignment of these youths, but that may be ac\u00ad complished by a salaried staff member. The senior volunteer escort service, such as that organized in Wilmington, is a volunteer program which requires a considerable amount of guidance and supervision. Older volunteers, of c~urse, make up virtually the entire program, which is designed primarily to protect older women m the community. The men who serve as escorts may be no more formidable physically than many of the women they protect, but numerous studies have indicated that the mere presence of any other per\u00ad son significantly diminishes the chance of an attack. V-42 1 I o ,\" Ii , 'I ~ \\ (=~ ~l'~ Volunteers who serve as escorts must be carefully screened by the program leader. Background checks are appropriate, as are character references. Men serving as approved escorts should b~ assigned personal identification cards from the local law enforcement agency. This identification should be displayed when offering services in order to avoid any misunderstanding or embarrass\u00ad ment. In addition to performing escort services, the volunteer may also distribute crime prevention education materials, conduct security surveys at residences, and encourage participation in other crime prevention programs, such as a neighborhood watch. In this 3ense, the escort service is con\u00ad sidered a useed\" program, comparable to Operation Identification. While performing the im\u00ad mediate task for which the program was formed, its participants also introduce others into addi\u00ad tional crime control programs. LIMITATIONS The use of CETA-supported youths as protective escorts is a highly beneficial experience fOl\" both young and old. However, the program tends to be concentrated in summer months only; which gives it the aura of a \"one shot\" program, not at all appropriate to the ]ongterm needs of the older community. Locations that have utilized youth patrols for senior escorts uniformly praise performance. Detroit reported that not one of 1,150 participating older persons was assaulted or robbed dur\u00ad ing the duration of the program. Nonetheless, insufficient time has passed to fairly evaluate any negative consequences that might yet be forthcoming from the experience. Transportation could become a problem, particularly when youths are assigned to visit the homes of older persons on a regular basis. Detroit solved this problem through a cooperative arrangement with the city Department of Transportation. The 95 cadets were permitted to travel on public transportation free upon exhibition of a special identification card issued by the police department. With reference to the all-volunteer Wilmington escorts, rather unexpectedly it appears f:iat many women are reluctant to accept rides in the patrol vehicle, even when men clearlY~nbVt their proper identification. It seems that peer pressures work both ways, and if the gentleman does not seem acceptable .... The experience suggests that successful volunteer programs of this type may require considerable input from the target group that is to be helped. In other words, it may be necessary to also treat the potential victim as a volunteer participant in the program. EXAMPLES Wilmington, Delaware. Older women are escorted by a volunteer escort service organized among older males in the community. Many of the details of this program have already been described. All volunteers must be over age 50. The initial volunteers to sta(t the program were furnished from the Wilmington Rotary Club and from the Kiwanis Club. V-43 , \" i ,! ( , , ..... 4 -. ' ... Nashville, Tennessee. Primarily a summer program, this youth patrol consists o,f approximately 100 low-income teenagers who are hired to provide escort service and other help to older citizens. Many of the young escorts are used at housing projects where older citizens have been victimized in the past. Youth escorts carry walkie-talkies through high-crime areas and serve as liaisons with police. The title of the program is \"Comnlunity Youth Relations Aides of Ten- nessee.\" Milwaukee, Wisconsin.'A Neighborhood Security Aid Program, headquartered in the Milwaukee Courthouse, provides escorts for olderresidents during trips to stores and,banks in order to prevent robberies.

REFERENC~S Title: Experience Exchange Author: Administration of Aging, U:;S. Dept of Health, Education, and Welfare This article appeared in Aging magazL,e (March-April 1978). It highlights several local programs that benefidally involve older citizens in community crime resistance or related programs. Discussed are block watch programs, victim assistance, and a summer youth patrol organized to provide pro\u00ad tective escort service to older citizens. The escort program (Nashville) is reportedly helping to dissolve a climate of fear that had existed among elderly residents of housing projects. Title: Wilmington, Delaware -Crime Resistance Task Force -Final Report Author: Wilmington Police Department NCJRS accession number: 09900.00.050766 Several crime resistance programs initiated in 1976 are described. Programs involve service to counter various crimes against the older population. The operation of an escort system using older persons as escorts for other of the same peer group is part of this report. Other programs include a \"hidden pocket\" program for concealing purses and more traditional crime prevention education. An evaluation of community involvement in crime resistance programs revealed that residents of high-crime areas were more likely to show commitment to prevention programs than were residents from safer areas. The gravest problem was a difficulty in overcoming an apparent distrust of others evidenced by many older citizens. Deep concern and frustration over crime and victimization could not quickly or easfIy be transformed into practical action. Many older victims remained skeptical and apathetic.

Eight steps are identified in the organization of an effective crime awareness and abate\u00ad ment program. These include: understanding the objective, identification of resources, education of members, determination of priorities, planning, implementation, publicity, and evaluation. Some general commentary is provided for each step. \" (] V-45 , . / I HEALTH AND PERSONAL SECURITY DESCRIPTION In a sense, the senior protective escort sevice descrit~d in the preceding section has provided a convenient bridge from programs that are predominantly centered on crime prevention to programs that perform a more social and/or health-related function, although still in the general area of in\u00ad creasing personal security. Particularly with reference to the kinds of additional helping services performed by some youth patrols, an effort was made to assist older members of the community in ways not directly related to crime. For instance, youth workers telephoned older residents or made visits to homes simply to make contact, to diminish the loneliness or isolation of the older person. Similarly, youth patrol members were taught. how to recognize certain symptoms of serious physical and mental health pro\u00ad blems in order to be able to make referrals when appropriate. Some health-related programs serve well as primary \"seed\" programs, which can be used to in\u00ad troduce the client to additional social or crime prevention programs that might be beneficial. These \"seed\" health programs are promoted separately or at the outset of a larger crime prevention educa\u00ad tion plan because these health-related programs are expected to be of particular interest to older per\u00ad sons in the community. Older citizens are realistically concerned about their health and personal security, particularly if they live alone. Two health-related \"seed\" programs are described in this section: the Vial of Life, and Operation Lifeline. Both utilize volunteer services to meet a specific need of older citizens, and simultaneously they serve to introduce the older client to additional programs and services . PROGRAM GOALS 1. To identify older persons and others in the community who are afflicted with special health problems. 2. To provide a means for improving emergency health services to those persons when needed. 3. To reduce the possiblity of tragic error caused by ignorance or delay in administering emergen\u00ad cy health care. 4i ' To reduce the anxiety of older or ill citizens with regard to their potential emergency health needs. , :i { , \\ To introduce participating members to additional programs and services that may be beneficial 5. to their well-being. OPERATION Vial of Life uses volunteers to co~tact and assist perso~ ~hO a~~~e~~~e~~:! ~~~:;:~I~rO}p;~~ health needs in the event of any accIdent or emergency w c cou municating their needs to responding emergency personnel. The Vial of Life refers to a plastic or glass container which is then placed on the door of the home or apartment so that respon . mg emergency ~ers~nnel (police officers, firefighters, etc.) will be alerted to the presence of the vIal. In addition to medicines and instructions for use, .the Vial ?f Life also ~ontai~s g~neral :~~:~~~- . make accurate, on-e-spo JU , dent. The name a~kiress, and telephone number of a relative or clo~e friend w~o lives in the s~me com\u00ad munity should b~ included, as should the name of any next-of-km located m some other part of the country. . .' . d t enable older and handicapped persons who live alone to keep in ~::;~t:~;:::::c:~~ !::~:~~ce ~n the event that accident or illness incapacitates the person or makes it impossible to summon help.

I~ the progr~m SImply by agreemg call the number daily at a scheduled time. Volunteers are utIlIzed to receIve calls. VOLUNTEERS Both Vial of Life and Operation Lifeline depend on volunteers for optimal effectiveness. Volunteers are used in the following ways: Program promotion. Volunteers distribute literature and announce the program at club and community organization meetings. V-48 \\ \" / Media contact. Volunteers provide announcements to newspapers and radio and television sta\u00ad tions and gain support from these important community resources. Enrolhnent. Volunteers maintain paperwork related to enrolling new participants in the pro\u00ad gram, and may contact members of the commQnity to encourage membership. With reference to Operation Lifeline, volunteers operate virtu~~y all aspects of the program once it has. been established. Their primary function here is to ti~~ff telephones during hours when calls are scheduled. In the Vial of Life program, volunteers may make house visits to new participants in order to assist and instruct the person in correctly filling out information to be inserted into the vial. OP'~1MAL BENEFIT EXAMPLES Additional information about operating details of the two programs described in this section are available from the following sources; Scottsdale, Arizona. Crime Prevention Section, Office of the She:r:iff. A Vial of Life program in Scottsdale has reportedly distributed 18,000 units to various participants in the metropolitan area, The vials that are used in the program are dispersed daily by the Scottsdale Memorial Hospital, which is a major source of support for the program. Huntington, West Virginia. Counseling Section, Crime Prevention Unit, Huntington Police Department. Calls are made to the police department each morning from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Volunteers staff the telephones. The cost to the department is maintenance of the telephone line only. The salary of the project coordinator is paid by an LEAA grant. LIMITATIONS While health and personal security programs, such as Vial of Life and Operation Lifeline, provide. valuable services for persons served by them, several valid criticisms have been made. Program leaders must be alert to ways to avoid the following difficulties or respond adequately to them. Some crit~cs point out that these programs, while requiring considerable volunteer organiza\u00ad tion, respond to the needs of only a very limited group. In terms of numbers the criticism is valid. However, the small number of people affectf~d do have a legitimate need. When the health program is used as a \"seed\" program to stimulate participation in other program'), some of t.he \"too small\" criticism is undermined. The Vial of Life program in particular may be per~eived 'as a \"one shot\" program. Once the vials ;:)re completed, the program ends. Again, use of the program to \"seed\" other activities is recomtmended. Ultimately Vial of Life, Operation Lifeline, and similar programs are aimed at breaking down the isolation of older and handicapped persons. ~ V-49 \\~ i!

The participant must keep in mini! that t~e information must be used by someone who has absolutc!y:r.u information about the family. I ~~', _ Some police admInistrators fear that encouragement of health-related programs may lead the public to expect medical advice and medical services from the police. While emergency care is frequently administered by a police officer who is first upon the scene, police administrators are reluctant to accept emergency health care as a routine police responsibility. In this case, both the problem and the answer lie far from the point of need. Operation Lifeline and similar programs work well in small cities, but the number of phones and volunteers needed to cover a major metropolitan area make the system unworkable, say some 'critics. In its classic form, this is true. One alternative for larger cities is a pyramid or \"chain-leiter\" organization of the telephone network. Groups of three or four persons must be organized, one of whom is designated group leader. The group leader calls a section leader to report \"all accounted for.\" The section leader calls a district leader, and so on. Actual calls to the police department are reduced to manageable proportions. REFERENCES Title: Operation Reassurance Author: G. F.

Some law enforcement and legal spokesmen believe that greater attention to these programs is critical, not only for purely humanitarian reasons, but also as a precondition for any significant improvement in crime control. Victim/witness assistance perhaps has been neglected for so long because the function seems to fall into a gap in our planned provision of needed services to citizens. Virtually all of the helping ser\u00ad vices needed by a crime victim are available within existing governmental organizations, but the bureaucratic mechanisms that have been established to maintain control over these services sometimes work to deny access to persons at the time that they need it. The failure, in other words, does not seem to be a lack of services, but a shortage of alert, sen\u00ad sitive liaison personnel who are in a position to identify persons in need, refer them to proper sources of help, and intervene when problems arise. That liaison role is essentially the function sought by most victim/witness assistance programs. Various distinctions can be made between assistance to victims and assistance to witnesses. Within this model volunteer program type we are considering programs that are directed toward helping the victim or witness deal with the physical and emotional consequences of victimization and involve\u00ad ment in the criminal justice system. The next section in this chapter describes court watching pro\u00ad grams, victim advocacy, and relatively impersonal court-oriented programs that assist in the pro\u00ad secution of criminals. Unavoidably, there is overlap because in many cases the victim and the witness are the same person. PROGRAM GOALS 1. To identify and offer immediate assistance t.o citizens who have become victims of crime, whether or not a suspect is involved. 2. To help victims recognize and cope with the immediate consequences of victimization, such as transportation, food, medications, and identification of the suspect, 3. To relieve anxiety and emotional dislocation caused by victimization. V-53 i , , l, i 4. To counsel the victim/witness in terms of the expectations of the criminal justice system. 5. To improve treatment for the victim/witness through the various phases of criminal prosecu\u00ad tion. OPERATION The purpose and goals of victim/witness assistance programs can b~ e~pre.ss~d in bro~d term~ that apply to all citizens within a jurisdiction. In practice, however, such mdlscnmmate assIstance IS not really available. Neither governmental agencies nor private volunta~y ~esou~ces have ~'et developed a truly comprehensive victim/witness assistance program. Instead, vlctml/wltne~s asslstan.ce te~ds to be delivered with reference to special crimes or special interest groups, for whIch there IS aVaIlable funding or sufficient volunteer interest to implement the program. Currently, victim/witness assistance programs are most evident with reference to: (1) crimes against the elderly; (2) child abuse; and (3) rape victiI~s. To ~ lesser extent, private ~olunteer assistance has also been mustered in response to other cnmes agamst women (battered WIves, etc.) and crimes against members of specific racial or ethnic groups. Within this section, the primary description is of operations of programs which assist older victims and rape .vict~ms, as well as witnesses who become involved in the criminal justice system as a result of a cnme m one of those two areas. The filLst imperative of a victim/witness assistance operation is prompt identification of the per\u00ad son in m~ed. Response to the victim must be made within 48 hours if the assistance is to be mean\u00ad ingful. Identification depends in virtually all cases on prompt referral. This is usually accomplished by a police agency or by some volunteer unit housed within the poli~e agency or working closely with reporting police officers. Referrals a~e accepted from ~ther publIc service agencies, from senior citizen groups and services, or fro~ fa~.lly mem.be.rs and fnends of t.he victim. Police officers may carry pocket-sized referral cards to dlstnbute to vIctIms who may not m\u00ad itially request assistance but may recognize a need for it at some latt~r time. Upon referral, clients are offered immediate aid as needed. Crisis counseling is offered and en\u00ad couraged. A limited emergency fund is usually available. for victims who la~~ o~he~ resource~ .. For the most part, however, service to victims is accomplished through faffilhanzatIon and lIaIson assistance to existing community resources. Some are list.ed below: Food allotments (Emergency Services Unit, Dept. of Social Services) Lock replacement (Hardship Unit, Dept. of Housing and Community Development) Medicines to replace stolen items (City Health Department) Transportation (reduced fare bus tokens from City Transit Dept.) Counseling (Senior Citizens Center, Dept. or Administration on Aging) V-54 . f I . , .- I \", I I Home security assessments (Police Departments) Escort service (Police Dept. or sponsoring community organization) Legal assistance, with reference to s(~eking reimbursement from insurance companies or available restitution programs (District Attorney's Office) Recovery of stolen pror)erty (Police Department) . Th~se services are nor~al~y ex~en~ed to include preparation of the victim/witness for involvement m vanous stages of the cnmmal JustIce system if a suspect is identified in the case. Repeated contact fo~ purposes of ~eassurance and. provision of updated information pertaining to the case is ideal, but thIs .type of serVICe depends on dedicated volunteer support. Particular attention should be paid to receIpt and response to complaints about harassment or threats experienced by the victim/witness. VOLUNTEERS Since most jurisdictions la~k .sufficient funds t~ .fully implement victim/witness assistance pro\u00ad grams, the use of volunteers IS, m most cases, a cntlcal element. With allowances for the form and content of local programs, volunteers might be used in the following ways: To make initial telephone contacts with reported victims upon referral, and to make follow-up calls as needed. To assist in ma~ntaining paperwork related to requests for services made to other agencies on behalf of the chent, and to follow-up as needed to obtain victim assistance. T? receive telephone calls requesting assistance, and to receive calls related to harrassment of WItnesses. With appropriate training, to make house calls upon victims for the purpose of counseling and further referral services. . !~ p~rform direct assistance, such as grocery shopping, when the victim has suffered physical mJUrIes or has been otherwise incapacitated by the victimization experience. To info:m the vi~tim/witnes~ of developments in the case as they occur; to keep information concernmg appomtments, tnals, etc., current and accurate. '. To assi~t. the v~ctim/~itness ~ith transportati~n, child care, or other services required in order to partIcIpate m hearIngs, trIals, or other criminal justice system demands. LIMITATIONS Innumerable things can go wrong, but most problems of victim/witness assistance programs can be reduced to two great shortages: money and skilled personnel. Money is occasionally available V-55 , (! 'i ,I i through grant funding, particularly when some innovative element is included in the local program. At other times a shortage of money can be partially offset by the use of volunteers. A lack of skilled personnel, however, can never be offset or overcome. At root, the victim/witness assistance pro\u00ad gram is important because it offers personal attention to individuals during a time of extraordinary stress. Interpersonal contacts under these conditions demand well-motivated, well-trained personnel if optimal benefits are to be achieved. There is also some difficulty in documenting goal achievement or conducting evaiuations of ex\u00ad perimental victim/witness assistance programs. Most persons involved in the process believe that benefits are real al1d meaningful, but there is continuing difficulty with documentation. OPTIMAL BENEFIT EXAMPLES Saint Paul, Minnesota. Through an organization known as Elderly Victims of Crime (EVOC), volunteers visit older victims at home to offer reassurance and direct assistance. Many of the volunteers are seniors and were also victims of crime. Group meetings bring together persons who share the victimization experience for the purpose of group support during the stressful aftermath and recovery period. Volunteers assist in obtaining lost Social Security cards, Medicare identification, etc. Volunteers also conduct security surveys. EVOC was begun in the st. Paul Police Department, but now is operated out of the mayor's office. Canton, Ohio. The Canton Victim/Witness Coordination Program was one of five national programs selected by the 111ternational Association of Chiefs of Police \u00b7as demonstration pro\u00ad grams in the field of assistance to older persons. Trained volunteers provide a broad range of services which include direct aid, counseling, and contact referrals to available sources of assistance within the community. Fort Lauderdale, Florida. An innovative program is operated within this jurisdiction. Two \"victim/witness advocates\" are attached to the Police Department. They are trained civilians, although not volunteers. Operating from the Police Department, these persons are often able to offer victim assistance at the scene of a crime or immediately after the police officer has inter\u00ad viewed a victim. They arrange transportation home for the victim, arrange a visit tl) a doctor, contact a welfare agency if that is necessary, and attend to numerous other forms of immediate assistance. Tucson, Arizona. Victim assistance programs are operated through a shared org~nization in\u00ad volving the Pima County Attorney and t.he County Sheriff's Department. A paid staff of seven persons is augmented by about 40 volunteers. Numerous direct assistance activities are )\\lnder\u00ad taken. Burglary victims are shown how to go about the process of recovering stolen property, if it has 'been found by the police department. Volunteers intervene with employers !OJnd landlords when necessary on behalf of the victim. They obtain time off for employed victims to assist the prosecution or help defer rent payments if money for that purpose was stolen. Huntington, West Virginia. The chief of police of this city initiated a unique counseling service that uses older volunteers to help rehabilit~lte senior citizen offenders. Senior offenders were usually charged with committing minor crimes, such as shoplifting.

While victim ad\u00ad vocacy programs normally include some assistllnce to victims, they also include components that are directed less at the victim than at the criminal. Aid to~'ctims is usually provided in order to improve or assure testimony at time of trial. ' \" , Victim advocacy programs candidly support the prosecutor during the course of a criminal trial. Most programs are organized within the office of the district attorney. Advocacy programs gen\u00ad erally seek to deny the defense any chance to\\vin by default. Programs include: Ia Timely notification of delays or changes in trial schedule, so that witnesses will not make needless trips to court; ! i Provision of transportation to court if it is needed; Intervention with employers to explain and request employee absence in order to appear in court; Q Provision of support services, such as babysitting; Pr6~ision of voh~rjteer guides and receptionists at the courthouse for the benefit of newcomers to the criminal justice system. Through such programs it is hoped that the victim/witness can be shielded from much of the discouragement and frustration that might otherwise lead to, aban40nment of the case. court-watchiD,g is an advocacy program designed to bring pressure to bear on the judge at a criminal trial. It is based on the premise that much of the efforts of law enforcement agencies and prosecuto~s have been frustrated in the past by lenient sentencing in the courts. The essence of the court-watching program is the use of volul1teer observers in the courtroom to systematically record information about the behavior of lawyers and judges, specificalI~ including the severity of sentences given convicted criminals. With the passage of time, a record is constructed that will identify judges who tend to deliver inordinately ligiit sentences. This record may then be I, used t() \u00a7eek di1imissal of the apparently biased judge or to affect changes in his behavior . . ,::-. ~ , ~\\ '7'~'7~' t.J._ .; V-59, GOALS To create a public record of COU!t perf~r~ance, particularly with reference to the severity or leniency of sentences given convIcted crImmals.

This cOllrt-wa~ching program In .WIlmmgton, Delaware concentrated the abilities of older volunteers to brmg about changes m /'\" -----~-behaviors. MAJIC volunteers sought permission to attend juvenile hearings, and eventually observers were permitted to compile a record of juvenile court decisions. MAJIC volunteers claim credit for tlfe introduction of a new law that would set mandatory sentences for repeat juvenile offenders. Citizens for Law and Order (CLO). This is a national organization that brings together people inside and outside the criminal justice system who believe that the courts should be more stern with convicted criminals. CLO claims more than 2,500 members in 197 cities. Among programs recommended for members, court-watching is suggested as a key instrument for bringing pressure on judges to deliver stiffer sentences. CLO is based on Oakland, California. (I Vera Institute of Justice. Vera is based d~ Brooklyn, New York. Among the court-oriented ser\u00ad vices provided is a telephone alert systeth tlw,tcan be used to inform police officers and other witnesses about scheduled court appel~rances. Time can be limited when necessary to a 3()..minute notice. Thc\"\"computerized court notification proces,~ is implemented by voluhteers. Women United Against Rape. This organization provides crime prevention education and defensive material related to the crime of rape, but its main thrust is to influence legislators and the courts to take decisive action to improve the situation :of rape victims in court. Public infor\u00ad mation campaigns and direct lobbying are utilized. Court monitors are recommended to observe and record behavior during rape trials. The organization is based in Indianapolis, In\u00ad diana. VARIATIONS In additio'n to court-watching, other closely related volunteer programs in the courthouse help the prosecutor gain a conviction 'in a criminal case by impr.oving waiting room conditions for witnesses. An example is provided by an organization known as R~VP in Ba,ltimore, Maryland. Volunteers serve as receptionists outside the Baltimore City Juvenile Court. Each day 60 to 75 clients, witnesses, social workers, and attorneys may spend up to six hours in the waiting room before a case is heard. The frustration level was understandably high, and some witnesses left before they were needed. The RSVP volunteers now take the name of persons as they arrive, tell them where they will be going, and answer questions. Volunteers explain court procedures to newcomers, and answer questions about the court's agenda for the day. The wait is still just as long, but the at- mosphere is more relaxed and there are fewer drop-outs. '. ,\";'.' Volunteers .are predominantly elderly and femafe, but they have adjusted well,to the tension of the court waiting room. Each volunteer works six hours per day, five days per week. Meetings are held each month to share experiences and learn from the previous month's activities. t'\u00b7\" V-61 , \"1\\ I( Ji i iii \\ I: 'I I \\.j 'I 1,1 d H \" '!

NCJRS accession number: 09900.00.049967 This publication lists programs operated by the police and courts of New York City to reduce the impar.t of crime for older persons. Recommendations are made for both criminal justice agendes and social service agencies who want to undertake similar programs. Programs are described th~\\t help older citizens obtain information about a case in progress that affects them as a victim or witness. Other programs help to get the elderly citizen to court in order to testify, while others aid in the recovery of stolen property. The court is acting to limit the number of appearances an older vic\u00ad tim must make in order to prosecute a case. The court monitoring project of the East Bronx Council on Aging is described in some detail. SPECIAL RESOURCES Victim advocate programs, including court-watching, are encouraged and to some extent sup\u00ad ported by the National District Attorneys Association. Support takes the form of excellent publica\u00ad tions that describe program components and related job descriptions. A nea.rly comprehensive directory of victim/witness assistance services throughout the nation is also distributed by the association. Programs described in detail include: property return, restitution, social service refer\u00ad ral, witness brochures, reception center, transportation, witness briefings, escort service, employer intervention, witness intimidation, witness fees, and child care service.

The use of volunteers in these cases makes it possible to provide services that could not be offered within the limitations of normal police budgets and man\u00ad power allocations. Crime prevention education programs-including Operation Identification, security surveys, and crime reporting systems-extend the police function by alerting citizens to their own security needs and providing the means for them to take pe.:::sonal protective action. Neighborhood surveillance groups, citizen patrols, and escort services all serve to deter criminals within a protected area by ex\u00ad tending or multiplying the normal patrol function of the police agency. In health-related programs and witness assistance programs, innovative services are provided that go far beyond the capabilities of the law enforcement agency. Through court-related programs, such as court watching, volunteer groups support police through activities in other parts of the criminal justice system. In this concluding section, we will itemize some programs that not only seek to extend the reach of Ahe police agency, but actually make it possible to replace police officers with volunteers. For some it is a controversial topic. \" PROGRAM GOALS To replace police officers with volunteers or other civilian personnel in properly' supervised police department activities . To use sworn police officers more effectively by transferring some ta~ks that do not require 1/ \" professional training or skills to civilian or volunteer workers. ..... '. . \\ To use the special skills or career experience of older volunteers to more effectively perforiA police department tasks that lie outside the professional or technical background of available law enforcement personnel. V-65 , ' \" ')} '!-' II' OPERATION \\\\ The kinds of work that can be performed directly for the law enforcement agency by civilians or volunteers are limited only by the total activity of the police department and the resources available within the civilian community. The following itemization serves as a general checklist: Clerical duties (typing, transcribing, filing) Administrative support (standard forms, routine reports, statistics) Crime analysis (computer operation, systematic reporting) Maintenance (routine Cleaning, repairs, improvements) \"I\" II t \"J . 1 Communications (telephone messages, routine correspondence, announc~)nents, response by form letter, and standard form) Crime prevention. (liaison services, literature distribution) property management (inventories, supplies, security details) \u00b7 .,~-i. Evidence packaging (sealing, labeling, preserving custody) Public relations (writing skills, photography, public speaking) Investigative assistance (laboratory skills, senior experience) o Technical consulting (special skills, special equipment) VOLUNTEERS AND LIMITATIONS Selective use of volunteers for routine police functions offers the possibility for more effective use of professional officers. Because sworn officers are not burdened with routine tasks that could be performed a~; lower skill levels, the officer is free to do more \"real\" police work. This is true only when the demand for \"real\" police work actually exceeds the ability of the department to supply it under normal working arrangements. If the time thus gained is not fully utilized in a higher or more specialized police skill category, the replacement program may have to be justified on other grounds. One such justification might be that the,;olunteer performs the task better than the sworn officer. Such tasks as typing, fi1il'~g, statistical analysis support, computer operation, property management, and public relations may ~!,l fact be performed better by a supervised volunteer than by a sworn of\u00ad ficer who must also perform professional law enforcement duties. r / .-(I , u )) () , ' The use of volunteers within the police department' is no easy accomplishrtient;. Certain basic s~~urit.y measures must be applicable. The volu~teer, furthermore, must be:made a fully par\u00ad tIclpat10g ~artner whose efforts are recognized and appreciated. Like any volunteer, rewards must be offered 10 te~ms of attention and gratitude for the service performed. Da~ly personal attention is freq.uently.reqUlred from ~ sUP~~i~or if the program is to work smoothly. Much of the same princi\u00ad ple IS applicable to part-time clVlban employees, particularly if skilled older persons are involved. The supervisor must keep in mind that the older volunteer who works within the police department milY not be compensated with quite the same social benefits as might be gained by participation in a ~roup of peers 10 some other activity area. Attention and appreciation keep the volu~teer on the Job. ' . ~lthough volunteers do~ate servi~es, other COS! considerations must be considered when planning to Implement a program wIth volunteer help. Office space must be made available. Supplies and any supporting equi,pment must be provided. The cost of telephone calls, transportation, and other nor\u00ad mal c?ns~quences of the activity must be considered. The ,pottom line, of course, is that hardly anythmg IS free. The real question is whether or not it represents a good investment. OPTIMAL BENEFIT EXAMPLES Crime Analysis. The San Diego, California Police Department has made extensive use of senior citizens within the crime analysis unit of the department. Older persons were hired to gather data from incident reports and manually code the data onto other forms. That initial task led to add!tional functions which have included on-line entry of data, quality control checks some rudlm:ntary ?nal~sis, and other. a~tivities involving the l!~of computer terminals. This pro\u00ad gram IS descr.lbed 10 greater detaIl 10 the following CASE REPORTS section which makes up the second half of this section of the manual. ' Team ~atrolli~g. Th~ city of R?~~ester, New York carried out an experimental pilot program t~at paIred police officers and CIVIlIans together to perform a foot patrol in various parts of the city ..

The exper1O~~nt 1Oc1ud,ed use of different kinds of patrol techniques .. Bicycles were used to in\u00ad crease moblhty by some patrol teams. The project was funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. Search\"and Rescue. Citizen volunteers who posses\u00a7-special skills and/or special equipment can be ~xtremely valuable. for successfully completing search and rescue missions.\" Both the Mancopa County, Anzona Sheriffs Department and the Duval County, Florida Sheriffs ~epartme?t mak~ ~se of volunteer posses to meet special needs of this kind. (Both agencies are discussed m det.aIl 10 the ~AS~ STUDIES that follow.) The posse at Wickenberg, Arizona, located near a vlrtuallr umnhablted stretch of m.ountainous desert, is frequently called upon to help locate lost campers or downed aircraft. The volunteer organization makes available v?I'i~us forms of speci~l equi~ment to local law enforcement. Special sub-groups operate ,;\" aIrplanes, four-wheel drIve vehICles, and a horse patrol. A J~~ksonville posse also supplies an off-shore patrol group to .look for lost boats or persons missing and feared drowned The special skills and technical 'expertise provided to the law enforcement agency by these g~OUPS have proven to be invaluable. 1/ 4 ----------'-\"--\"----\" \" I .[ 'i 'j , i Holiday helpers. Numerous police agencies accept assistance every year from community groups that offer to staff telephones and perform other routine clerical tasks in the. police department over the Christmas holidays.;Work performed by volunteers at this time makes it possible for a f\\}w additional police officers to spend time at home with their families during the Christmas season. Groups most frequently associated with this gesture are B'nai B'rith and local senior citizen groups.

It has a staff of 22 and a limited budget with which to serve a growing community. In 1975 the Police Department budget was reduced, necessitating the elimination of two civilian positions. At the same time, however, Cottage Grove was experiencing a 25 to 30 percent increase in burglaries from the year before. Developing an approach to solve this problem became a priority of the department, despite the fact that there were fewer fulltime employees. Police officials realized that a crime prevention program was necessary to address the problem of the Cottage Grove community. Faced with a decrease in manpower, the department was forced to look toward alternative approach::..'] to the situation. Department officials then decided to adopt a volunteer program utilizing older cItizens, since people aged 60 and over make up 23 percent of the population. SENIOR CITIZEN CRIME PREVENTION PROGRAM (SCCP) The primary objective of the Senior Citizen Crime Prevention Program is to not only check the alarming increase in the crime of burglary, but to reduce its frequency overall. Burglary was the most frequent of the P~t I offenses committed in Cottage Grove. Further, the amount of burglaries committed had dramatically increased in recent years and .had reached alarming rates by 1975. Because of this, department officials adopted a goal of reducing the number of burglaries in the community by five percent a year, hoping that these \"small steps\" could reverse burglary trends, as the .- / I Senior Citizen Crime Prevention .

A final goal of the SCCP Program was to focus crime prevention attention on the older popula\u00ad tion in the, city and provide them with the knowledge nece~sar! ~o assist in protecting themselve.s. By volunteering to actively participate in the,program, these mdlVlduals would have an opportumty to serve their community. Since the program has been designed to orient the public to crime. prevention technique!), especial~ ly burglary prevention volunteers visit hdmes in and around the Clty. They travel door-t.o-door by request and demonstr~te the worth and methodology of property id~n~ificat~?n sy~~ems. They also conduct security surveys to help residents, identify problem areas wlthm t,h~lr homet:,. V-72 but to\u00b7a far lesser degree,'contact with crime victims to provide com\u00ad fort and possible assistance. In addition,. volunteers serve in a liaison role between the community and the P0.Jice Department for' occasional functions, but the greatest thrust is in crime prevention education. This crime prevention education thrust addresses directly the need to reduce the number of burglaries in the community. When the program was established, the approach of property iden\u00ad tification systems and security surveys was deemed appropriate by the project direC'ltor, who was then a captain in the department. Responsibility for the program was placed at this high level of command to help ensure its acceptance and success, both within the department and the communi\u00ad ty. PROGRAM OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES The SCCP Program is staffed by older volunteers and the project director, who is now chief'of police. The number of volunteers fluctuates according to availability, but the chief and two volunteers who have been active since the program's inception serve as the decision-making bod~V. As new approaches are considered, the volunteers can accurately describe the points of view of the community's residents. The chief must weigh the effects of new program ideas upon the departmen'lt and its functions. Ultimate responsibility for all program activities lies with the chief. Initially, volunteers were recruited by \"word-of-mouth\" by the project director. The screening process now includes a personal interview with the director and a background investigation. Training consists of a one-day orientation to the criminal justice system and the Cottage Grove Police Department. All volunteers then attend a two-week regional training seminar on crime prevention conducted in Eugene, Oregon. On-going training consists of participation in the ac\u00ad tivities of the Crime Prevention Association of Oregon. The program is highly motivational for the volunteers, since their activities provide personal satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment~ as well as recognition from the community and the department. Volunteers have received several awards from the city and state for their ac\u00ad complishments and a great deal of support,trom the department for their dedication and commit- ment to purpose. /i ;i \\\\, /i The costs of the project are an important aspect of the scep Program. Since its inception it has received no federal or state funding, and in three years has delivl~red crime prevc;!ntion education to over a' thousand households at a cost to the city of approximat(~ly $200 per year. All staff time is gratis, including the time of the project director. The volunteers devote anywhere from 15 to 40 hours per week, and the director monitors and provides input to the project as necessary. The SCCP program uses a crime prevention van which is donated free of charge by a local dealer\u00ad ship. Before sizeable mileage is accumulated, the dealer reclaims the van for,retail sale and provides the project with a new one. This virtually eliminates maintenance costs and assures reliable transpor\u00ad tation at all ~l.. ,. .. } .' . The evaluation of program impact is part of the routine crime analysis procedures conducted on a regional computer time-sharing basis. The statistical information is reflected in the annual report of the Police Department. The minimal cost of the program and the exclusive use of local resources serve to maintain the SCCP on a continuing basis. Local control and protection from external contingencies are desirable and effective aspects of the program. In addition to benefiting the Cottage Grove community, the SCCP Program has garnered favorable media attention, both locally and nationwide. The program has been described in Parade .Magazine (1977) and its director received a Special Citation from Parade and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. PROGRAM RESULTS Because the program was established in early 1975, results could not be measured uniiltlteJollow\u00ad ing year in terms of burglary reduction. The following chart represents the burglary data t~bulated for the years 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1978. Year Number of Burglaries 0/0 of Change (i 1975 195 + 31 % 1976 152 -230/0 (\"'year one of program) 1977 122 -20% 1978 134 +10% rfhe data,reflects a significant impact on the rate of burglary, with important qualifications. First, m,\u00b7any factors are involved in both the causation and reduction of crime, not just one program. Sec\u00ad O!id, the very nature of the program will increase the number of contacts between the police and the community, thereby improving the reporting rate of crime. This can help to explain the 10 percent rise in burglary rates experienced in 1978. Further evidence of this is the significant increase of in\u00ad progress reports of all crime types, a benefit attributed to the SCCP Program. The program has also created strong ties between the department and the community. The depart-\" ment participates in many community functions and overall receives a great deal of positive atten\u00ad tion from the public. The volunteers carryon their activities beyond the city limits of Cottage Grove. They are active members of the statewide Crime Prevention Association, and are well-received as resource pe~sons throughout Oregon. Finally, this program has established the older volunteers as community leaders on many issues. They enjoy increased influence in their city and can have a direct impact upon many problem areas. V-74 1\\ Through the initiativ~ of a concerned Police Department and the support of its community, a pro\u00ad gram effectively addressing the problems shared by both groups has been developed. The Cottage Grove Police Department now has a greater input Into community de(~ision-making and is expand\u00ad ing the realm of services it provides. Additionally, it is now involving its older volunteers in such . departmental functions as property and evidence processing. This will allow even greater use of the professional resources in the department in an era of decreasing budgets. V-7S .. \" , ~,...., , CASE REPORT Sun City, Arizona Maricopa County, Arizona is one of the largest. counties in the United States, encompassing an area .of over 9,000 square miles. This far-flung county contains a population of over 1,000,000 in its urban and rural setting with mountains, lakes, and deserts interspersed with cities and towns. \" The size and terrain of Maricopa County represent an enormous responsibility for the Sheriff's Department, and yet this vast region receives outstanding law enforcement service from a depart\u00ad ment with only 350 sworn deputies. This is possible only because of the extensive use of community resources by the Sheriff's Department. The Sheriff's Department has existed since the county was founded in 1871-41 years before Arizona became a state. Under subsequent Arizona law it has enjoyed the right of posse comitatus (the formation of the Sheriff's Posse), and county residents have been activeiy engaged in general posse functions for more than 20 years. The d,epartment took an active role in organizing posses throughout the county, by area and func\u00ad tion. Today volunteer posses perform a wide range of activities, including: Land, sea, and air patrol and search and re~cue; Desert rescue and survival training; Underwater diving search and rescue; Mounted and jeep patrol; Paramedic rescue; Clergy; Crime prevention; Communications; and (/ Corrections. Over 2,000 volunteers provide their time, vehicles, equipment, and money to assist the depart\u00ad ment county wide. Posses are also formed for specific geographical areas in order to provide immediate law enforce\u00ad ment services to residents. Sun City is one such area served in this fashion. Unique in a number of ways, the city has a population of nearly 50,000, which is considered to be high for sparsely\u00ad populated Arizona. It is a retirement community of individual homes and condominium . developments. The Sun City Sheriff's Posse is made up entirely of city residents, who are by defini\u00ad tion older volunteers, and they provide their community with quick and efficient law enforcement services. V-77 , t , ----~~-~----.-,----------- II THE SUN;,CITY SHERIFF'S POSSE \\\\ The members of the Sun City Sheriff's Posse, Inc., which was established in 1973, .serve as th.e eyes and ears of fhe sheriff. It is their role to provide ~ la~ enforc.ement P!esence for !heu commUDl\u00ad ty at all times, as it is physically impossible for the sherIff or hIS deputIes to do thIS. As a service organization, the Posse defines its purpose in Section 1.01 o~ its By-Laws: \"To assist the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in maintaining peace, law, and order ~n our community at any time and in any manner as and when requested to do so; to e public spirited; to promote good fellowship; and to promote the support of law and order and the law enforcement (iYSW1l1.\" A further goal is to support Sun City and address the needs of its residents by whatever roles are called for, be they law enforcement functions or not. The primary function of the Sun City Posse is to patrol the community and report ar; suspiciO~S activity to the Sheriff's Department. This patrol is performed 24 hours a day, seve~ ays a w~e . Importantly Posse members do not arrest or detain possible violators of the la~.. os~e~en. ave itizen arrest owers only' they do not have police powers. They are to report SUSpICIOUS e aVlOr or ~ituations to ihe departm~nt, and allow sworn officers to investigate and deal wIth these problems. Secondary activities of the Posse cover a wide range of services needed by the commu;ity. Tr:ffic direction is a major part of this, as is crowd control during special events. W~en ne~de , :~~or ser: vices are provided for visiting personalities, and more oft,en for the more fraIl mem ers 0 e com munity. Some Posse members are trained in the use of firearms ~nd ride w.it? a~d assist the reg~lar deputies This is not the case with all Posse members, since fIrearms trammg l~ voluntary:n: IS a lengthy, 'rigorous process to complete. Only those members who have met ArIzona Law n orce\u00ad ment Officer Advisory Council (ALEOAC) standards may carry a weapon. The Eyes And Ears Of The Sheriff Sun City, Arizona Posse Patrol Traffic Direction Crowd Control Escort Services Crime Prevention V-78 f I PROGRAM OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES The intial Posse developed from what had been a Civil Defense TeClm. The approximately 30 members of that group officially became the Sun City Sheriff's Department Posse when they were sworn in by the sheriff in 1973. A Board of Governors was elected by the Posse members and, whe1ll the Posse was first estab\u00ad lished, it consisted of one commander, six lieutenants, and the sheriff or his designated deputy. As the program developed and expanded, additional functions were assumed and the Posse now pro\u00ad vides for as many as 12 lieutenants. The volunteer Possee members are recruited by \"word-of-mouth\" and through media contacts. Prospective members are screened by an Oral Board Committee, which consists of current members serving on a rotating basis. The Board of Governors makes the final decision on prospective enlistees. All new Posse members receive basic training in the following areas: The Posse, its organization, rules and regulations; The uniform requirements; The relationship of the Posse to the law; The communications system of the Posse; Traffic control; Vacation watch; and Red Cross first aid and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation procedures. Specialized training is offered to qualified members in traffic control, self-defense, and firearms. The firearms training includes classroom instruction and practice on the Posse range. Trainees must also qualify on the sheriff's range in order to carry guns, in accordance with ALEOAC standards. Posse training is conducted in churches, banks, and recreation centers. A single facility to house all Posse activities is being planned. Once a new member fulfills his training requirements, he is assigned to a patrol shift. Patrols are carried out on foot and in the Posse cars with emergency lights and emblems. Members are supplied a yellow jump suit, helmet, and wristle, and are kept in communication with headquarters by two\u00ad way radio. All radio communication is taped for records and futUi'~ recall. The costs of the Posse are borne entirely by members and community donations. There is an an\u00ad nual fee of $2.00 per membtlr~ and donations have provided for Posse patrol cars and uniforms, as well as for the communications system. There is no outside fundins sought or received by the Posse. I \\\\ While the motivational aspect~ of participation in the Posse lie mostly in personal satisfaction and community prestige, a certificate also is awarded to each member upon completion of training. The sheriff selects an \"Outstanding Posseman of the Year\" ,( 'j Ii ;1 ~ i I -Media recognition of the Posse has been overwhelming.\" Pos~e activit~es are well known throughout the community, and there has been a great deal of outsIde attention. PROGRAM RESULTS As Sun City grows toward its limit of 50,000 people, the Posse gr~ws with it. What ~ad initially been a \"vacation watch\" conducted by the Posse has now expanded mto a full-scale Nelg?borhood Watch Program for the entire community. The Posse patrols have helped to reduce t~e cn~e pro~\u00ad lem. The FBI.Uniform Crime Reports show Sun City to have the lowest crime rate of any cIty of Its size in the country. In addition, the Posse has as~isted at numerous public functions by providing escort ~ervices a?d crowd and traffic control. 'this has allowed the Sheriff's pepartment to deploy Its deputIes elsewhere rather than be tied up at such functions. Another vital benefit of Posse activities is the furtherance of cri~e prevention ~~ucation in the community. Through Posse presentations and actual neighborhood mvolvement, CItIzen awarenes~ of the deterrents to crime is high in Sun City. v-so . . REPORT Santa Ana, California , ,. The Santa Ana Police Department, prior to 1975, had established crime prevention, rape educa\u00ad ,tion, and community relations programs. These programs typified the one-way community educa\u00ad , tion approach found in many law enforcement agencies. However, in October, 1975, the department adopted the conc~pt of Community Oriented Polic\u00ad ing, which established a variety of approaches to meet the crime prevention needs of the Santa Ana community and, most importantly, involved the citizens in action programs to benefit both ,', themselves and others. Over 25,000 Santa A.na residents are actively involved in the various pro\u00ad grams today, out of a total population 'Of 186,000. By January of 19176 the Community Oriented Policing Program (C.O.P.) had become fully opera\u00ad tional and (surveys, etc.) which were already bemg condtl,cted by the department.

COMMUNITY CRIMINAL ACT[ON COMMITTEE (CCAC) The Community Criminal Action Committee was conceived in November.of 1977 .to monitor the criminal justice process.

Judges consider past histories and sentence offenders appropriately. These objectives are compatible with the goals of the criminal justice system itself. However, the citizens of Santa Ana had felt that the system was no longer living up to these standards, and three concerned individuals formed the Committee to monitor the procesSes. ' , . The Committee expanded rapidly since 1977 and its membership continues to increase steadily. \" The volunteers are almost exclusively older persons and, as the Committee grows, so do the func\u00adtions of the members. The Committee volunteers watch the court process when following a case and research criminal records for information pertinent to the case. Committee members help the District Attorney gather information on a case, and inform the presiding judge about activities carried out by the Commit- tee. )J // ,' .. / . ,~/ Related activities include a legislative watch program, with eriminal justice-related proposals and legislation highlighted and analyzed in the C.O.P. (Community Oriented Policing) Bulletin. Fur\u00ad ther, ever:t~eJection year the Committee publishes a record of the performance of all judges in the jurisdicti~\\n.\u00b7 The Committee was established because there was an apparent need for the case monitoring pro\u00ad cess, based on the dissatisfaction of the community with the workings of the criminal justice system. \u00b7In order to effectively work within such a system, credibility had to be established with the police, the presiding judge, the Office of the District Attorney, and the Clerk of the Court's staff. This was accomplished primarily by the program's three fou!iders, who maintain close working relationships with all four offices and receive the full cooperation of each . The legislative watch and the judicial performance record (eviews were viewed by Committee members as enhancements of their initial activities; the ben~flts of these activities were related to their long term goals of an effective criminal justice system, Committee members felt. .. The responsibility for all of these activities lies with the three individuals who initiated the Com\u00ad mittee. The personal credibility established by these individuals permitted the committee to suc\u00ad cessfully implement its various ac.tivities. 'I PROGRAM OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES The CCAC's membership consists entirely of volunteers, mostly older, retired persons. The decision-making board includes the chairman, vice chairman, a secretary, and a Santa Ana Police Ii Department liaison officer. The board members receive inputfrom the other voh.fnteers. This board is responsible for recruiting, screening, and training the volunteers, as well as establishing guidelines for Committee operations. Further, each board member supervises either a case following pro\u00ad cedure, court watch, or the public relations .. -\",\",\"~ 11 I' ,j t\\ 11, 11 n \\I .1 il Ii II tI ii .1 )1 Ii ~ II ,I Ji .1 ,I ,I H \\. The \\olunteers are recruited by-word-of.\u00b7mouth and through a brochure. Training consists of an introd~ction to the various functions of the Committee by stages; the initial stage i5;:to serv~ as a court observer. A trainee is assigri~d to an experienced volunteer, who explains the various processes of the court and, at the same time, determin~s the suitability of the trainee for assignment to a par\u00ad ticular case to monitor. From there, the volunteer moves into researching court records, and even- tually to interaction with the District Attorney's,Office. All volunteers receive in-service training once a month on the procedures and goals of the Co~\u00ad mittee. This session is conducted by the board and, because of the advanced age of t~e volunteers, IS generally limited to one hour. Court watchers.~re briefed on pertinent developments m the half hour preceding the start of the session. There is a very low turnover rate, and a program volunteer has never been d~s~issed. The o~\u00ad going screening process serves to determine the appropriate level of involvement wlthm the Commlt- t(!e by the volunteer. The low turnover rate is an indication of the self-reward experienced by the volunteers. Cer\u00ad tificates are awarded to the volunteers after 25, 75, and)50 hours have been logged, and the Com\u00ad mittee has received an award from the California Crime Prevention Officers Association. The costs of the program are relatively small. The printing, postage, and post office box are paid jointly by the members. Each volunteer provides his own travel. The Committee operates out ~f the homes of the volunteers, although the growth rate will necessitate office space and a telephone m the future. There is no outside funding sought or received by the Committee. Donations will be accepted in the future as office needs matf.!rjalize. The actions of the Committee have receivt')d media attention, but such attention has been limited. The Santa Ana Police Department hal! initiat~d news stories about the Committee on several o~ca\u00ad sions but the local newspap~rs have shownl,mited interest. As the activities of the CommIttee beco:Ue more widely known\" media interest will correspondingly increase. Committee activities have not been formally evaluated beyond maintaining records of cases fonowed. Necessary changes in Committee procedures are decided at board meetings and volunteer meetings with board members. PROGRAM RESULTS Although the Committee was formed in November of 1977, actual program implementation did not begin until February, 1978. In a one-year time span, over 3,000 hours in court had been logged by Committee members, and'15 felony cases involving habitual c~imi~als had been. fol~o~ed from start to finish. Of those 15 cases, 14 resulted in longer sentences bemg-Imposed than m SImIlar, non- monitored cases. More importantly, the criminal justice process has received greater public scrutiny than ~ver before, and the decision-makers within the system tia:ve been made acutely aware of that scrutmy. Public accountability has produced significant results. ~------'--'.'-' .. ' ,. 1 th~ beyond effectin1.4 changes in the crImmal JustIce system, bes m the approach taken by its members. Concerned citizens of Santa Ana saw a problem within a massive system of government, and took it upon themselves-to try to correct it. Using their own resources-primarily time and interest-they were able to effel.::t change for the better interests of the criminal justice system and the community it serves. SENIOR CITIZENS ASSISTANCE PROJECT (SCAP) The Santa Ana Police Department initiated its Senior Citizens Assistance Prcuject on March'! 1978. This program, as the name suggests, deals exclusively with older persons and the problem~ they face in the community. The purpose of SCAP is to actively attack the crime problem as it relates to older persons. Beyond this, however, an effort -is made to reduce the vulnerability of the older person to' criminals and to provide assistance to the victim after a crime occurs. A further effort is made to assist individuals in civil problems as well. These programs necessitate a wide range of interaction between the police and older persons. The primary objectives of SCAP are to deliver crime prevention techniques specific to older per\u00ad s~ns and ,to provide assistance to older victims. As needs can be identified, other police-related ser\u00ad vIces ar~ ~ncluded. These objectives focus on the department's goal of aiding older persons, as well as provldmg the SCAP volunteers with a vehicle to provide assistance when and where necessary. An officer of the Santa Ana Police designed this strategy, and he is now program coordinator, SCAP's activities include: Crime prevention program delivery; Community education programming; Victim assistance; Information and referral; and Civil and criminal investigation. These activities are carried out by three Police Department staff members and a ste~ldily increas\u00ad ~ng nu.mb~r of older vplunteers. The volunteers are included in all activities with the exc\\~ption of the mvestIgation process. ' The department recognized the need for this type of program in the community, and ,mowed the coord~nating officer to devote his full attention to it. He initially contacted senior citizen groups and establIshed an Advisory Board. This Board assisted in referring him to existing programs\\ for older\u00b7 persons, which established the inter-agency contacts necessary for successful implementation OIf the SCAP ac~ivities. The personal interest and\"initiative of the officer was important in making,~he :proj- ect a realIty. \\ V-85 , \\ ':1 ! JJ , \\; ~ j 1, :t , ) ~ :1 i ;. , , I PROGRAM OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES The SCAP project was established in the Police Department by a verbal commitment from the chief, the captain in command of 'the Field Operations Division, and the area commanding lieu\u00ad tenant. This commitment was attained by personal meetings between the coordinating officer and each of the decision-make~s, demonstrating the need for and benefits of the program idea. The area lieutenant agreed to serve a,s director, on a part-time basis, with the SCAP officer serv\u00ad ing fulltime as coordinator. Assisting him are an administrative assistant and a service team coor\u00ad dinator. The volunteers are split into service teams and make up the bulk of the project staff. Two paid staff members were acquired through the CETA and Manpower programs; the volunteers were recruited through the media and by word-of-mouth. All staff members, who were screened by the coordinating officer, received specialized training in the aging process, crime prevention, and volunteer services. The Orange County Department of Mental Health assisted in the training process. Since the inception of the program only one volunteer has left, ,due to fulltime employment elsewhere. This staff retention rate indicates the degree of personal satisfaction the volunteers , receive from the work they do. A lunch program and prolcedures to award certificates of achieve\u00ad ment to volunteers have also been developed by the coordinator. Project costs consist primarily of the salaries of the coordinating officer, the administrative aide, and the service ,team coordinator. The Police Department pays the salary of the coordinating officer as well as minor printing costs. The salaries of the administrative assistant and the service team coor\u00ad dinator are paid by CETA and Manpower funds. Office space' is provided by the department and a local senior citizens center, both at no cost to the project. The program has been publicized by the local newspaper and radio stations. Media attention is periodically stimulated by the department's public information officer. The project is continuously monitored by the coordinator, who provides progress and achieve\u00ad ment reports to his supervisors. There is no formal evaluation system. PROGRAM RESULTS The SCAP project. became fully operational on August 1, 1978. During the following six months: Over 50 crime prevention meetings were conducted. Assistance was provided to victim.s in over 550 cases. The program is represented on four advisory boards of senior citizen service agencies. On-going criminal and civil investigations have been conducted by SCAP staff for cases involv\u00ad ing older victims. V-86 , \" In this brief time span the growth of SCAP h .

Senior aides in San Diego, California are employed by the Police Department to provide a variety 'of support service duties-from analyzing crime data to par\u00ad ticipating in long-range planning activities. The San Diego Police Department employs 1.37 sworn personnel per 1,000 popUlation and 1.85 total personnel per 1,000 population at an annual operating cost of $43.76 per capita. San Diego covers 320 square miles and has a total population of over 830,000. SENIOR AIDES IN SAN DIEGO'S CRIME ANALYSIS UNIT The San Diego Police Department employs senior aides as part of its Integrated Criminal Ap\u00ad prehension Program (ICAP), which was established with funding support from the U.S. Justice Department's Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. ICAP seeks to identify, apprehend, and prosecute career criminals. The crimes selected as the initial targets of the program in San Diego were robbery, rape, child molestation, and burglary. When ICAP was initiated in 1976, San Diego's Crime Anfllysis Unit, which employs eight full-time personnel, faced a massive task of encoding in\u00ad formation from thousands of police reports and criminal records to establish a computer data base for an automated ~~\\llalysis capability. The involvement of older persons as part-time employees in the Crime Analysis Unit was recommended by LEAA as an effective way to provide the needed police support services. ' Eleven senior aides began work at the Police Department in 1977. They are paid $3.00 an hour and work on four-hour shifts, three-to-five days a wet,~k. When the program was first established, senior aides were assigned rudimentary crime analysis tasks, but they now perform many other jobs. Among the tasks performed by senior aides are: 1. Encode data from police reports. 2. Use the computer terminal to enter and check data. 3. Make data correlations for quality control purposes. 4. Develop graphs and logs. 5. Publish and distribute \"daily alert\" or \"investigative supplements.\" 6. Correlate photos with Identi-Kit composites. 7. 'Study false alarms involving burglaries and intrusions. 8. Provide administrative assistance, including typing and filing. 9. Update criminal history records. 10.

Although there was some resistance by department staff to the idea of older people workmg In ~ law enf~~~e\u00ad ment environment, this resistance disappeared once the senior aid.es demonstrated theIr capabIlItIes and competence. V-90 \" . . , .-, ' I l (::, The amount of supervision required for senior aides is the same as for regular full-time employees and less than that required for typical temporary help. Senior aides in San Diego are more amenable to directions and more inclined to ask questions than are many full-time employees. Furthermore, the seniors' positive job outlook is reflected in their exemplary attendance'records and low turnover rates. The program attempts to keep administrative procedures short and simple. An outside agency was contacted to identify older persons for the available senior aide positions. This procedure cuts down on calls to the Police Department from potential applicants and minimizes the amount of time spent in interviewing unacceptable applicants. Department staff members conduct on-the-job training so tthat the senior aides are available to provide the Crime Analysis Unit with skills and active program support within the shortest time possible. Day-to-day supervision requires minimal record-keeping. Evaluations of the capabilities, needs, and limitations of each senior aide involve redefining tasks performed by the aide to meet program priorities and needs. Short, simple administrative pro\u00ad cedures assure program success. PROGRAM RESULTS The involvement of senior aides in San Diego's Crime Analysis Unit is a mutually beneficial ar- , rangement. The department is obtaining skilled services which are cost-effective and produce results. For example, 168 work hours per month cost $504 when provided by a senior aide but cost $885 ($704 salary and $181 in benefits) if the same services are provided by a clerk typist, the basic entry-level clerical position in the Crime Analysis Unit. The savings to the department are $381 a month, or $4,572 a year, for each senior aide employed. The senior aides are highly motivated to do a good job. The older persons who work with San 'Diego's Crime Analysis Unit feel that they benefit, not just from the salary, but from being rtcfive!y 'involved in providing a meaningful service to the Police Department and their community. \\::\\ Police administrators throughout the nation are constantly confronted with the problem of insuf\u00ad ficient manpower to complete a giv~n job within the constraints of time and budget. San Diego has established a successful program which offers an alternative for police managers. , ' () / CASE REPORT Jacksonville, Florida The Sheriff in Jacksonville, Florida is responsible for the largest geographical area of any city in the nation-over 840 square miles-which is a result of consolidation between Jacksonville and Duval County. A small force of full-time deputies, coupled with sharply rising law enforcement costs resulting from inflation, contributed to the sheriff's decision in 1975 to solicit help from non\u00ad paid volunteers, who now serve in a variety of posses and reserve units. The sherifPs posses augment police services to the community and foster community involvement and support in crime prevention activities. The concept of volunteerism is the foundation for each posse-there is no monetary reward system. THE POSSE PROGRAM The Police Public Services Division, which has 20 full-time professional employees, manages a, cadre of over 600 civilian volunteers, many of whom are retired persons. The varied backgrounds and abilities of the volunteers enable the sheriff to utilize their services in a variety of law enforce\u00ad ment functions-from uniformed patrol activities to the implementation of social change. For ex\u00ad ample, posse volunteers provide the following services: 1. Duval Sheriff's Community Posse. Inc. Most of the members are ham radio operators who' have set up communications for volunteer groups, assist Records and Identification Personnel, and provide communication for SWAT Team exercises. 2. CommuTrjity Posse. This posse seirves as the primary crime prevention unit. The members assist in crime prevention educational programs, conduct security surveys of homes and businesses, establish Neighborhood Watch Programs, distribute Vials of Life and whistles, and staff exhibits in shopping centers and at fairs. 3. Four-Wheel Drive Posse. The first posse to be established, this group serves as an off:-road search and rescue unit, looking for lost or missing persons, stolen vehicles, and crashed aircraft over' 400 square miles of underdeveloped land. They also furnish security for marijuana seizures, assist in traffic control for football games and other public events, and patrol beach areas. V-93 ---------------- .. -'\".~ .. Marine Posse. Th bers provide 34 boats which are equipped to patrol all the waterways of Duval County an~ ::~ in crowd control, searcht~s, rescues, and police operations on the waterways. 5. Mounted Police.

Sheriff's Motorcycle Escort. This posse provides motorcycle escort services for a variety of occasions. The volunteers supply 20 matching Harley-Davidson motorcycles. . 7. Duval County Sheriff's Watch. Fourteen volunteers assist the Office of the Sheriff by monitoring Citizens' Band Radio Channel 9, the emergency channel. '--~8\"\". Victim Advocate Program.

PROGRAM\u00b7 OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES . The requirements for volunteers vary slightly from posse to posse, but all posses share the same basic recruitment and training concepts. Prospective posse members are required to apply in person. Ages Qf volunteers range from 18 to 75. Each applicant undergoes a background investigation, which includes checking his arrest record, traffic record, and personal references. After the in\u00ad vestigation has been completed, an Oral Review ~oard, which consists of one posse member and two sworn officers, determines the applicant's reasons for wanting to join, his attitudes, and other pertinent illformation. '\"I Once he has been selected, the new posse member must participate in a basic training program, which includes first aid, search and rescue, defense tactics, and firearms training (a minimum of 15 hours at the ,range). With the exception of the Community Posse, each volunteer carries a firearm. All volunteers buy their own uniforms and pay their own expenses. No volunteers receive salaries. Sworn, full-time deputies are assigned as coordinators for each posse to supervise the perfor\u00ad mance of all duties by the\u00b7 volunteers. If a volunteer does not follow rules and regulations, he is relieved of duty. Careful r~ljruitment, screening, placement, and training of each posse member has provided the Sheriff's offfc~,!,!ith a large number of volunteers. . !f // \\\\ 1,/ PROGRAM RESULTS The volunteer posses provide a large number of needed personnel to the Sheriff's Office at no charge to the taxpayers. The following chart details the support provided by volunteers in 1978: Number of Posse Volunteers Communications 30 Community 42 Four-Wheel Drive 150 Marine 65 Mounted 8 Motorcycle Escort 20 Victim Advocate 2 TOTALS 317 Manhours 1,300 8,342 18,295 1,116 contacts Although the posses have contributed thousands of man hours to the Sheriff's Office, they are on\u00ad ly called upon when needed. The successful continuation of a volunteer program such as this re\u00ad quires that the law enfor'cement agency sustain the motivation of the volunteers by providing them with an>:::opportunity to perform necessary comV'o'mity services. Jacksonville's posses benefit the department, the community, and its members. 0J V-95 o , I~ .. r rr f I r . \" ~, , .-o \" \\. > ! .. A, . , -------~-- I~ IJ.\u00b7 '. a CASE REPORT Huntington, West Virginia In the city of Huntington, West Virginia, older persons and police have established:.\\ cooperative program to provide community services to elderly and handicapped citizens. The \"corQ'erstone\" of the program is older volunteers, who contact program recipients daily by phone to check on their well-being. With this \"Lifeline\" program, many lives have been saved. 1/ ./ The city of Huntington, in the West Virginia portion of the Ohio Vall~:.Y, covers a la1Jd area of ap\u00ad proximately 16 square miles in Cabell County. Of its 75,000 people, at/proximately 20 percent are above the age of 60. \\1\" OPERATION LIFELINE Operation Lifeline provides a daily phone check for any interested older citizen, handicapped per\u00ad son, or individual living alone. The lifeline telephone call provides daily reassurance for individuals that someone cares about them and will provid~ services if an emergency situation occurs. Operation Lifeline was established in 1974 and was staffed by police personnel on a volunteer basis. However, other law enforcement duties reduced the amount of time police officers could devote to Lifeline activities. New volu/rteers from a local university assumed responsibility for the daily phone calls, 'but academic needs ~nd campus activities created scheduling conflicts. The police then asked older volunteers to manage the program. Lifeline now has seven older volunteers who coordinate their own schedules. Volunteers work from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. to receive calls from program members, who call Lifeline every morning during those hours; as each member calls, the \\0, volunteer marks off his name for that date. Should a member fail to call, the volunteer wil!~all him. If the person cannot be reached by phone, a police officer will be dispatched to his house . . ', To obf~~ membership in Lifeline~) an older citizen or handicapped individual calls the Police Department's Crime Prevention Unit or the special Lifeline number and asks to be placed on the list. Lifeline activities include: 1. Free plood pressure check once every three months. 2. Vacant house check when member is on vacation or in the hospital for extended time period. 3. Programs on crimes against the elderly . () , I: 4. By request, the Hi Y club boys will assist members in activities requiring strenuous physical ef\u00ad forts. S. Dinners sponsored twice a year for members. Operation Lifeline Huntington, West Virginia Polic~ Department Provides reassurance and affects the quality of life for older persons V-98 .-.... ' t, Ii . \" ----~-. -=.....,.----~----~--------~------- Program Operational Procedures Volunteers for Lifeline are recruited with the assistance of the media and civic organizations. Training by the Police Department is not required-new volunteers receive \"on-the-job\" training. Volunteers coordinat~ their own work schedules and provide their own transportation. The opportunity to provide a needed service and civic recognition are the only rewards volunteers receive. Their dedication is exemplified by longevity, stability, and dependability as program volunteers. Since the Police Department began recruiting older citizens to staff Lifeline, there has been little turnover in personnel. Those volunteers who have left gave reasons of poor health or per\u00ad sonal necessity. PROGRAI'tl RESULTS Lifeline began with 20 members and now provides daily contact services to approximately 300 older persons and handicapped citizens. The program benefits for members, volunteers, and the police cannot be measured in statistical terms. However, the Police Department has significantly im\u00ad proved its relations with the community at little cost (the fees. for telephone extensions) and has received maximum benefits. I:..ifeline members receive reassurance and positive contacts with law en\u00ad forcement persomiiH. In several instances, lives have been saved when members were contacted in time. The older volunteers themselves benefit by knowing that they are providing a useful service . which might not otherwise exist. Police agencies throughout the country are limited in providing needed community services because of budgetary and manpower restrictions. Through the use of older volunteers, as in the Huntington Lifeline program, an effective community relations program which provides a useful and necessary service can be implemented and maintained at little cost to the agency . V-99 , .- .' ~ . ... / CASE REPORT Pinellas County, Florida The Sheriff's Department in Pinellas County, Florida has actively utilized community resources for several years. Its volunteer program is one of the most extensively developed crime preven\u00ad tion/ education efforts in law enforcement. The jurisdiction of the county includes the cities of St. Petersburg and Clearwater, each with substantial retirement communities. Persons aged 65 and older make up a large percentage of the county population and thus have a great deal of input in community affairs. It is this input and a ge\u00ad nuine desire on the part of older residents to better their community that have contributed to the success of the crime prevention! education program. JUNIOR DEPUTY LEAGUE The Pinellas County Sheriff's Department Junior Deputy League, Inc., was founded by 12 con\u00ad cerned older members of the community in 1958. At that time it was felt by the older population that the new generation of youngsters in the county did not have an adequate understanding of the purpose and need for law enforcement, specifically the Sheriff's Department. Positive steps to cor\u00ad rect this problem, the older residents felt, would help maintain a good community spirit throughout the county. The League was established to develop an educational program for the schools in the coun\u00ad ty-public,private, and parochial. This program, as a functional component of the Sheriff's Department; teaches elementary school children about law enforcement' while at the same time develops their respect for the system itself. The program leaders also targeted junior and senior high school audiences for presentations in specific aspects of law enforcement, primarily in the areas of crime prevention and awareness. These presentations also are made available to interested adult groups in the community. The involvement of the older community was a primary concern to program leaders, since the program was initially established to provide an opportunity for older citizens to contribute a service to their community while at the same time stimulating an awareness of crime prevention among younger residents. Because of the emphasis placed upon early orientation of youth to law enforcement, the League primarily involves itself with the elementary schools in the county. A regular schedule of presenta\u00ad tions is maintained for each school, covering such topics as traffic safety, drug awareness, crime prevention, building a respect for law enforcement, and other criminal justice concerns. V-WI , f{ ;1 ;1 , ; ! -~-,-,~--,--,-.-,-=-----..,.,.......,..---------------------- The volunteers use a variety of approaches in their pres~ntations in order to stimulate the interest \" of the children. Along with lectures there are slide and film presentations, display kits, and pam- phlets. The children participate in simulated traffic situations and have an opportunity to see su~h law enforcement aids as fingerprinting kits and training dogs. As each group of children goes through the program they become junior deputies. Most impor\u00ad tant to them is the badge they receive, but they are also given a Junior Deputy Manual and pam\u00ad phlets on topical areas of law enforcement. The presentations to junior and senior high school audiences are conducted less frequently than are the elementary school programs. T,hese upper-level programs focus on one topic, such as drug use, and are much more detailed-thh'~ due to the increased comprehension level of the audience and their need for specific information. The Crime Prevention Unit also makes presentations on crime awareness and prevention to citizens' groups. These progams are scheduled by ,request only, and participants receive the pro\u00ad gram's accompanying literature. Presentations to adult groups are made by older volunteers. Under the supervision of Sheriff's Department Crim~ Prevention Unit deputies, voluJiJeers are trained as needed to conduct the presentations and are provided with the necessary accompanying materials. I Junior Deputy League Pinnellas County, Florida 1978 V-I02 .-\" 't Sheriff's Department 1968 1958 ','\"',,,,' \" , , . PROGRAM OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES The Pi;\"ellas County Sheriff's Department Junior Deputy League, Inc. is a privat~, charitable, non-profIt corporation. Its members are retired and non-retired Pinellas County residents. The sheriff serves as the chief executive on the League's Board of Governors, and an major activities are decided upon by this body. All pos!tions within the League are volunteer. ,:. if The Sheriff's Department Crime Prevention Unit provides funds for\" 10 paid staff members to coordinate work activities with League Members. The county is divided into three districts, and each district is provided with a deputy to present programs at elementary and secondary schools. The Junior Deputy Program supervisor for the Sheriff's Department coordinates the work activities of the three district deputies. Each deputy is responsible for regular presentations at 3Q elementary schools. In addition, he coordinates other programs, which are presented by volunteers. The crime prevention supervisor and the project coordinators are all graduates of the National Crime Prevention Institute in Louisville, Kentucky. Since its inception the League has be~n an influential community organization. League member\u00ad ship provides the volunteers with an opportunity, to bring about change, and gives them a sense of accomplishment. Members periodically receive appreciative commendations from the county, and the self-motivational aspects of the project are substantial. \" When the League was first established, there was substantial commitment but no finances. To get the program off the ground, the Sherifrs Department agreed to share the costs, which are divided on the basis of purpose. The Department funds the salaries of two sergeants, four deputies, three coordinators, and one clerk-typist, and provides the vehicles, office space, and supplies. All other program costs are borne by the League, which obtains funds from contributions and local restaurant association \"dine-outs,\" from which a portion of the proceeds are contributed to the League. The amount of equipment needed has grown considerably with the program. Major cost items are projectors and films, stationery, moter vehicle maintenance, and a 35 mm camera. The total cost of the project, including departmental salaries, is approximately $87 ~OOO per year. The League, through its fund-raising efforts, contributes about $16,000 per year. Evaluations of the presentations are conducted by school administrators and faculty, who report back to the Junior Deputy Program supervisor the effectiveness of the delivery. They also receive feedback from the students 'and pasS this information on to the Program supervisor as well. Because it is a private, charitable, non-profit corporation, the League is able to present programs in all schools--public, private, and parochial. ~h.e Junio.r DepVrt.y League and the educat~onal presentations have received a great deal of posItIve medlaatten~~on. There has been, extensIve newspaper coverage, and approximately 8 to 10 public service announ~ements are made on televisiQn each year. In addition, th~-~roject has received V-103 , nationwide acclaim in magazines, journals, and on network television as well. This has greatly enhanced the image of the Sheriff's Department, both locally and nationally. PROGRAM RESULTS Since its relatively limited start in 1958, the Junior Deputy League now is involved with 80 elemen\u00ad tary, 9 junior high, and 11 senior high schools. In addition to this are the presentations to communi\u00ad ty groups, which are not systematically scheduled but are conducted as they are needed. The most outstanding result of the League's activities has been the reduction of crime in Pinellas County. This has come about through an effective dissemination of crime prevention information to . a variety of community audiences. Further, as the school children mature and become tomorrow's citizens, that awareness will stay with them. Consequently, League efforts will serve to benefit the county in future years as well. Because the League is dealing very visibly with the community, it stimulates more public involve\u00ad ment in the criminal justice system. Citizens are discovering the very important role they must play to make such a system work. The older volunteers who actually deliver the presentations are serving as active catalysts for community self-improvement. For them there is also the satisfaction of pro\u00ad viding a worthwhile and successful contribution to their neighborhoods. The result of League activities has been a better community to live in, with a greatly enhanced im\u00ad age of the Sheriff's Department and its employees. This is evidenced in letters the children write about the program, making such statements as \"I made a friend of a cop.\" This is the ideal which the League strives to achieve. V-I04 . t I -, .-....
