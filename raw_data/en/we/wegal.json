I am not one for the whole \"megadosing\" thing that a lot of people try. However, I am human, and I do make mistakes. That is what happened yesterday. I was reading through Russian studies on SEMAX, and got myself confused. This caused me to second guess my initial research on the proper dosing for SEMAX. The studies in question were mentioning 12-24mg doses, which is much higher than I had been reading before. What they failed to mention was that they were talking about 1% solution, not the pure peptide. In a moment of stupidity, I decided to inject 24mg of SEMAX peptide. It was only afterwards that I realized I had made a big mistake. For my body-weight, the dosage should actually be between .5mg and 1mg. The 24mg milligram injection I did was a little excessive to say the least. Fortunately I am still alive. It is a neuropeptide, and gets broken down into its amino acid parts very quickly. So there was no risk of adverse interactions. The only issue was a small headache that appeared for about 20-30min, and went away very quickly. I can say that it was an enjoyable experience, though! SEMAX modulates serotonin and dopamine, so for a while I was really feeling good. It is definitely an effective nootropic. Probably the most effective one I have taken so far; for mood at least. I injected 1mg this morning, and the effects are pretty much the same, if not better. There seems to be a bell shaped response curve, which my stupid 24mg dosage went over. This 1mg is a much more balanced effect. So please don't' do what I did. Always double and triple check your dosage calculations before dosing, especially with a subcutaneous injection. There is no reversing it once you push that plunger. However, we now know that SEMAX is relatively safe acutely, and seems to be very effective. "}
