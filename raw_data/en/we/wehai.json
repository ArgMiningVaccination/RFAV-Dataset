The Dean of Students may impose one or more of the following sanctions for any violation of the Code . The following sanctions listed are not exhaustive but are intended to serve as guidelines. Administrative Hold A status documented in the Registrar's office that precludes the student from registering from one or multiple programs, if dual enrollment for future quarters, receiving transcripts, or graduating until clearance has been re ceived from the Dean of Students.

A copy of any notice will be kept in the Dean of Students Office on ly but will be used in any future violations as an example of continued counterproductive behaviors . Page 40 : 2022/2023 Student Handbook The purpose of this policy is to establish disciplinary procedures to guide the enforcement of the Student Code of Professional Conduct. These procedures a pply to any student or student organization that is charged with a violation of the Code. However, because of the individual nature of students, their behaviors, and the particular circumstance involved, the University may not in every situation be able to follow these procedures precisely. Deviations from the outlined timeline and/or procedures may occur on occasion and will not invalidate a decision or proceeding. These disciplinary procedures are designed to allow for fact - finding and decision -making in the context of an educational community and to encourage students to accept responsibility for their own actions. The intent is to provide adequate procedural safeguards to protect the rights of the individual student and the le gitimate interests of Sonoran University . Records that are generated during the investigation/decision - making process associated with these procedures are general education records protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Initiation of Investigation Investigation of alleged violations of the Code may be initiated at the discretion of the Dean of Students, with or without a referral from a member of the University community. A member of the University community may refer a matter for investigation by submitting a completed Grievance or Violence/Assault Reporting Form on MySonoran , or through direct report to the Dean of Students . Based on the information provided, the Dean of Students will determine appropriate next steps. The Dean of Students will decide whether further investigation/fact -finding is necessary Where the alleged misconduct is related to discrimination or harassment, the Dean of Students will consult with the Office of Human Resources to determine whether an affirmative action investigation is warranted. A determination by the Dean of Students will be made following consultation. Interim Action At any time following the initiation of an investigation into alleged misconduct, the Dean of Students may suspend a student for an interim period prior to resolution of the disciplinary proceeding, if the Dean of Students believes that the information supporting the allegations of misconduct is reliable and determines that the continued presence o f the student at Sonoran University poses a threat to any individual, property or University function. The Dean of Students will notify the student of a decision to suspend for an interim period effective immediately as of the date of the written decision. The notification will also identify the specific restrictions and limitations that have been placed on the student, including access to facilities, ser vices, and activities. The interim suspension will remain in effect until a final decision is reached on the pending charges or until the Dean of Students determines that the reasons for imposing the interim suspension no longer exist. A suspended stude nt who is suspended for an interim period may request that the Dean of Students reconsider the interim suspension by providing a written explanation why they believe the interim suspension is unwarranted. The Dean of Students will provide the student with a final determination of the reconsideration request within five (5) business days of receipt. The Dean's decision on any request for reconsideration is not subject to further review. The University reserves the right to place a hold or suspend the release of all federal financial aid funds until the investigation of alleged allegations and/or dis ciplinary process is completed, and the student is allowed to resume regular classroom or clinical studies. Review and Decision by Dean of Students Upon their own initiative or based upon a referral by a member of the University community, the Dean of St udents will investigate allegations of misconduct involving the Code. Such investigation may include interviewing the complainant, the alleged perpetrator, and other witnesses; gathering and reviewing documents; and taking other action to obtain informatio n relevant to the allegations. Dean of Students will notify the Dean of the respective school that an investigation has begun on a suspected student. Members of the University community will be expected to comply with any request or directive issued by th e Dean of Students in connection with an investigatory/disciplinary proceeding. A student who is charged with violating the Code will be provided an opportunity to meet with the Dean of Students. Such meetings may occur simultaneously with the Dean of Student's interview of the student in connection with the Dean of Students investigation or may occur separately, at the discretion of the Dean of Students. A student who fails to respond to the meeting invitation and/or fails to attend the meeting with the Dean of Students will forfeit their right to respond on their behalf regarding the alleged violation. Disciplinary Procedures Page 41 : 2022/2023 Student Handbook At the meeting, the student will be provided with an explanation of the charges which have been made. If the student denies the charges, the student will be provided an oral or written summary of the evidence against the student and will be given an opportunity to explain their side of the story. Upon completion of the investigation, the Dean of Students will determine whether it is more likely than not that a violation of the Student Code of Conduct has occurred and, if so, the appropriate disciplinary sanction to apply. The Dean of Students will inform the student of the decision, in writing. A copy of the decision will be maintained in the student's file. The written decision will include a statement of the charges, the determination, and the sanction to be imposed, if any. This decision is final and is effective immediately. However, in the case of a suspension in excess of 10 school days ( long term suspension) or expulsion, the student may request an appeal hearing to review the determination. If the Dean imposes a sanction of long -term suspension or expulsion, the student shall be advised of their right to request an appeal as part of the notificat ion of the decision . If the sanction imposed includes either long term suspension or expulsion, the student may request an appeal hearing before a Hearing Officer by filing a written request with the Dean of Students Office no later than five (5) business days following the date on which notice of the written determination is sent to the student. After five (5) days, the determination becomes final , is effective immediately and is not subject to further review. The filing of a timely written request for a hearing may suspend the imposition of the disciplinary sanction of expulsion or long -term suspension, except for an interim suspension, pending the outcome of the appeal hearing. If the sanction is long -term suspension or expulsion, and the student reques ts a hearing, the student will not be permitted to graduate until the hearing process has been concluded. Appeal Hearing before Hearing Officer Applicable to l ong-term suspens ions and expulsions only. Purpose of the Appeal Hearing Upon request of the student, an impartial hearing officer will conduct a hearing to review appeals submitted to the Dean of Students regarding long -term suspensions and expulsions. The purpose of the appeal hearing is to hear the evidence and formulate a recommendation to the Vice President of Student Affairs (VPSA) as to whether a violation of the Code of Conduct was more likely than not committed by the student, and if so, the appropriate sanction to be imposed. Selection of the Hearing Officer Upon receipt of a request for an appeal hearing, the Dean of Students will notify the VPSA of the request, and the VPSA will select an impartial hearing officer to conduct the appeal hearing. Subject to the requirement that the hearing officer be impartial and disinterested, the VPSA may select a Sonoran University employee with no prior knowledge of the case and no direct interest in the outcome to serve as the hearing officer. Alternatively, at the VPSA's discretion, an independent hearing officer may be hired to conduct the hearing if an impartial and unfamiliar employee is not available . The hearing office r must be selected and identified to both parties within five (5) business days of the receipt of a request for an appeal hearing . A student may challenge the participation of the hearing officer on the grounds of personal bias by submitting a written statement to the VPSA setting forth the basis for the challenge within two ( 2) business days of identification.

Otherwise, neither party will be permitted to be represented by legal counsel at the hearing. The hearing will be recorded by a recording device and will be transcribed in whole or in part on the request of the student charged with the misconduct. The student will pay the cost of such transcript. At the request of either party, witnesses other than the Dean of Students and the student alleged of misconduct will be excluded from the hearing except during their own testimony.

Clearly articulate the problem/challenge: Document the problem. Identify who, what, where, when, why, a nd how. Provide evidence to support the concern. 2. Prepare to resolve the problem/challenge: Try to see both sides of the issue, not just your side. Be open to understanding how the Respondent see the issue. Research and review the appropriate college poli cy, process, guideline, protocol, and/or published requirement. Cite the provision(s) that may have been violated, remembering that the Course syllabus are the guidelines for operation and implementation of a course, Collect any additional information and background you may need. Seek advice and support from an impartial third party that can help you see different perspectives. Identify at least one, preferably more, potential solution(s) that would settle the issue. Page 46 : 2022/2023 Student Handbook 3. Have a calm, rational conversation with the Respondent: Request and schedule an appointment in person or virtually. Clearly and succinctly articulate your points. Cite the relevant policy, process, guideline, protocol, and/or published requirement provision(s). Listen objectively to understand the other person's point of view. Provide your possible solution(s). Listen to their possible solution(s). Always maintain decorum, and a calm demeanor. 4.
