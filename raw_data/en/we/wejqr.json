The [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267755v1.full.pdf) from researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Harvard and MIT that has not yet been peer reviewed tested blood from people who received the Moderna [(MRNA.O)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MRNA.O/), Johnson & Johnson [(JNJ.N)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/JNJ.N/) and Pfizer [(PFE.N)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/PFE.N/)/BioNTech vaccines against a pseudovirus engineered to resemble the Omicron variant. The researchers found \"low to absent\" antibody neutralization of the variant from the regular regimens of all three vaccines - two shots of the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines or one of J&J's single-dose vaccine. But the blood from recent recipients of an additional booster dose exhibited potent neutralization of the variant, the study found. The scientists also suggested that [Omicron is more infectious than previous variants ](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/omicron-poses-very-high-global-risk-data-severity-limited-who-2021-12-13/)of concern, including about twice as transmissible as the currently dominant Delta variant, which may soon be overtaken by Omicron. The results are in line with other studies recently published. Researchers at the University of Oxford [said on Monday](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/two-dose-vaccines-induce-lower-antibodies-against-omicron-study-finds-2021-12-13) that they found the two-dose Pfizer and AstraZeneca [(AZN.L)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/AZN.L/) COVID-19 vaccine regimens do not induce enough neutralizing antibodies against the new variant. BioNTech and Pfizer [said last week](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/biontech-pfizer-say-test-shows-3-doses-vaccine-neutralise-omicron-2021-12-08) that a three-shot course of their COVID-19 vaccine was able to neutralize the new Omicron variant in a laboratory test, but two doses resulted in significantly lower neutralizing antibodies. Moderna and J&J have yet to release any of their own data about how the vaccines perform against the new variant. J&J declined to comment on the new study and Moderna did not respond to request for comment.
