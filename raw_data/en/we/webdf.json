Matriculating students are defined as those enrolled in a degree seeking program or an in-person certificate program. This includes both undergraduate and graduate students. The following are mandatory: (Students born before Jan. 1, 1957 are exempt). You must provide proof of one of the following: - Two MMR immunizations (one on or after your first birthday and after Jan. 1, 1969 AND one at least 28 days later and after Jan. 1, 1980), OR - Documentation of positive MMR titer (blood test), OR - Documentation of date of MMR disease by your health care provider (Students born in the U.S. before Jan. 1, 1980 are exempt) You must provide proof of one of the following: - Two varicella immunizations (one on or after your first birthday and one at least 28 days later), OR - Documentation of positive Varicella titer (blood test), OR - Documentation of date of varicella disease by your health care provider (Required for students living on campus only) You must provide proof of having received a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine not more than five (5) years before enrollment. Examples of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines include Menactra or Menveo. A Meningococcal Disease Fact Sheet is available (see below). Tuberculosis (TB) screening All students are required to complete a series of TB risk assessment questions. Students determined to be at high risk for TB need TB testing as outlined on the Medical Report form. The following are recommended, not required: Hepatitis B immunization is recommended. (This is not a requirement). A [Hepatitis B Fact Sheet](../../../../../files/documents/undergraduate/student-life-and-services/health-and-wellness/health-center/immunization-requirements/health_hepatitis_b.pdf) is available. Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine is recommended. (This is not a requirement). Teens and young adults (16 through 23 year olds) may also be vaccinated with a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (Bexsero or Trumenba) to provide protection against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Two or three doses are needed depending on the brand. (This vaccine is given in addition to the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine.) The University is strongly recommending vaccination against Covid-19 for all students. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone should be vaccinated as soon as they are eligible. The available Covid-19 vaccines are considered safe and effective. Individuals with \"up-to-date vaccination\" status are significantly less likely to become seriously ill or be hospitalized. Vaccination helps to break the chain of disease transmission, prevent emergence of variant strains and will protect others as well as the vaccinated individual. For more information, please visit the [Vaccines for Covid-19 page on the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/).
