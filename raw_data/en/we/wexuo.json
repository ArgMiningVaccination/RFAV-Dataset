Most employees will reenter on March 30, 2022 , followed by a 6 -month evaluation period. We will use the evaluation period to develop, assess and, if necessary, adjust any personnel or operational policies to provide publ ic service and accomplish our mission as well as, or better than, prior to the pandemic. Also, consistent with M -21-25, we have updated our COVID -19 Workplace Safety Plan (WSP) pursuant to current Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. (See Appendix 1) Ample Notice Consistent with M -21-25 and applicable memoranda of understanding (MOU) with labor organizations and prior to implementing reentry plans, SSA will provide a t least 30-days of advance notice to any employee returning to the ph ysical workplace or who will have altered work schedules during reentry or the evaluation period. Work at Home by Quarantine Policy (WAHQ) We will discontinue WAHQ policy on March 30 , 2022. Reentry On December 1, 2021, senior leadership began reentry. On March 30 , 2022, we plan the safe return of most employees onsite, after ample notice, in compliance with SSA's WSP, and in consideration of the lessons learned during the pandemic. SSA's agency -wide evacuation order will expire on March 29, 2022. With the expiration of the evacuation order, all policies and Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) provisions in effect on March 13, 2020 are reinstated, except where a provision expressly conflicts with the respective reentry MOU and safety measures in the WSP. Each Deputy Commissioner has determined the number of scheduled telework days, if any, eligible positions, and percentage of employees permitted to telework, consistent with applicable CBA provisions and relevant agency policies, as described in the chart below. Any employee who teleworked during the pandemic (between March 16, 2020 -March 30 , 2022) will be eligible for, at a minimum, episodic telework if the em ployee meets the eligibility criteria in the applicable CBA provisions or agency policy. 2 Employees ineligible for telework, or who choose not to participate in the voluntary telework program, will return to onsite work for all scheduled work hours beginning March 30 , 2022, unless a local evacuation order necessitates remote work. Managers and executives may telework. Line managers will telework consistent with the work unit they manage. Individual employee telework schedules will be determined by telework agreements in accordance with the following Deputy Commissioner (DC) -approved plans. 3 SUMMARY OF COMPONENT TELEWORK FOR REENTRY & EVALUATION PERIOD Office of: Exceptions1 Number of Days Per Week through 6 -month Evaluation Period2 The Actuary No 5 days for all staff General Counsel No 5 days for all staff Analytics, Review, and Oversight Yes 5 days for most staff3 Budget, Finance, and Management Yes 5 days for most staff3 Communications Yes 5 days for most staff3 Hearings Operations Yes Varies 3-5 days3 Human Resources Yes 5 days for all staff Legislation and Congressional Affairs No 5 days for all staff Operations Yes Varies 2-5 days3 Retirement and Disability Policy No 5 days for all staff Systems Yes 5 days for most staff3 The Commissioner Yes 5 days for most staff3 Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity No 5 days for all staff 1 Appendix 2 provides a list of positions by component that will be eligible for less than five days of telework per week based on regular onsite work requirements. 2 Employees may be subject to recall based on periodic onsite work requirements consistent with applicable CBAs and agency policy. 3 Unless depicted in Appendix 2, employees in this component are eligible for five days per week telework. 4 Evaluation Period During the evaluation period, we will expand access to our services consistent with the safety measures in the WSP. We will use the evaluation period to develop, assess and, if necessary, adjust any personnel or operational policies to provide public service and accomplish our mission as well as, or better than, before the pandemic. Each DC will evaluate their operations to identify ways to improve service, hire and retain the best employees, and to operate efficiently including the consideration of potential space savings resulting from increased telework and information technology improvements. As we reenter our offices, we will measure and monitor several areas, including: customer satisfaction, service availability, workload management, employee experience, stewardship, and environmental considerations. We will consult with the unions on prospe ctive metrics in the evaluation of these areas. Based on our evaluation, we intend to finalize longer -term plans to implement in fiscal year 2023. 5 Appendix 1: Workplace Safety Plan 2.0 Social Security Administration (SSA) COVID -19 Workplace Safety Plan 2.0 March 30, 2022 6 Contents Introduction ................................ ................................ Symptom Monitoring and Screening ................................ ................................ ................................ ....................... 13 Quarantine, Isolation and Steps Following Exposure to Someone Suspected or Confirmed COVID - 19 ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ...... 14 Appendix 2: certain specific positions ................................ ................................ 15 Appendix 3: List of Operations employees ineligible for telework ................................ .......................... 18 7 Introduction We are updating the October 26 , 2021 Workplace Safety Plan (WSP) to incorporate the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on protecting w orkers . This update \u2014WSP 2.0 \u2014 complies with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M -21-15, Safer Federal Workplace: Agency Model Safety Principles (last updated September 13, 2021 ) as modified by OMB Memo randum M -21-25, Integrating Planning for A Safe Increased Return of Federal Employees and Work Environment , and the President's Executive Order (EO) 13991, Protecting the Federal Workforce and Requiring Mask -Wearing . We will comply with all applicable court orders, including by following relevant OMB and Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance on EO 14042 Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols f or Federal Contractors and guidance on EO 14043, Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees. As noted in the October 26 , 2021 WSP, this plan is a living document, which we update to align with the most current CDC and OMB updates and mission needs. Additionally, we will continue to communicate updates to our employees via Commissioner Broadcasts or our Human Resources Internal Communications (HRIC) and to the public on our website . This update is being implemented upon satisfaction of applicable labor obligations with labor unions representing our employees. We respect the important role of our labor unions and are committed to communicating regularly with employee representatives on workplace safety matters. We will also continue to consult with our stakeholders including Congress, and advocates, as appropriate. For additional details on our COVID -19 pandemic policies, employees and managers may visit our internal COVID -19 website , which includes Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) f or managers and employees. The public can find detailed information about how we are operating during the pandemic by visiting our COV ID-19 webpage . Workplace Safety Plan Health and Safety We communicate all safety policies to employees via email, and managers remind employees of these policies during regularly scheduled staff meetings. We maintain a COVID -19 intranet site with Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for managers and employees. Signage explaining our safety measures are prominently displayed in all buildings used by our employees, visitors and onsite contractor staff. We explain our safety policies when we arrange appoi ntments with members of the public. Our plan is available to the public on our website . Security guards will ensure the public complies with posted safety measures. We have communicated our safety measures to contractors via email and in updated contract language. 8 Vaccination To ensure compliance with a preliminary nationwide injunction prohibiting implementation and enforcement of the vaccination requirement for the Federal workforce, see Hu man Resources Internal Communication (HRIC) issued January 24, 2022: Federal Employee COVID -19 Vaccination Mandate - Update | Employee Dashboard (ssa.g ov), the agency will take no action to implement or enforce COVID -19 vaccination at this time. However, employees may be asked for their vaccination status documentation and should follow all the safety protocols for the unvaccinated if they do not provid e documentation of being vaccinated. Employees Safety protocol guidance issued by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force applies to all employees. Employees must provide documentation of being fully vaccinated or will be considered unvaccinated for the purposes of agency safety protocols . In the Human Resources Internal Communications and the agency's Vaccination Statu s Portal , employees receive detailed information about how to document their vaccination status , including the Privacy Act requirements and the requirement to certify under penalty of perjury that the information they submit is true and correct. The agency grants leave -eligible employees up to 4 hours of administrative leave per dose , including for a booster , or to accompany a family member (as defined in OPM's leave regulations, see 5 CFR 630.201) who is receiving any COVID -19 vaccination dose. The agency grants leave -eligible employees up to four hours of administrative leave per dose\u2014for example, up to a to tal of twelve hours of leave for a family member receiving three doses \u2014for each family member the employee accompanies. If an employee needs to spend less time accompanying a family member who is receiving the COVID -19 vaccine, the agency grants only the needed amount of administrative leave. Employees should obtain advance approval from their supervisor before being permitted to use administrative leave for COVID -19 vaccination purposes. Employees are not credited with administrative leave or overtime work for time spent outside their tour of duty helping a family member get vaccinated. This policy applies to covered vaccinations received after July 29, 2021. The agency grants up to 2 workdays of administrative leave if an employee has an adverse reaction to any COVID -19 vaccination dose that prevents the employee from working (i.e., no more than 2 workdays for reactions associated with a single dose). The employee may take other appropriate leave (e.g., sick leave) to cover any additional absence. IMPORTANT: A ll previously submitted exceptions to the COVID -19 vaccination requirement will be held in abeyance. Managers should notify employees with pending exception requests that implementation or enforcement of the COVID -19 vaccination requirement pursuant to EO 14043 is currently enjoined and that an exception request therefore is not necessary so long as the nationwide injunction is in place. 9 Vaccination for New Employees New employees should be prepared to provide vaccination documentation as soon as their first day of employment. Employees who do not provide documentation will be considere d unvaccinated for the purpose of safety protocols. Contractors Given the different safety protocols for individuals who are fully vaccinated and those who are not fully vaccinated, SSA will ask about the vaccination status of onsite contractor employees who are not yet contractually required to be vaccinated. These contractor employees must attest to the truthfulness of the response they provide. For contractor employees not yet subject to a contractual requirement to be vaccinated, SSA has provided contractors with electronic access to complete the Certification of Vaccination form prior to arrival at an SSA facility. When a contractor employee discloses that they are not fully vaccinated or declines to provide information on their vaccination status, SSA will treat that individual as not fully vaccinated for purposes of implementing safety measures, including with respect to mask wearing and physical distancing. Onsite contractor employees who are not fully vaccinated, or who decl ine to provide information about their vaccination status, must provide proof of a negative COVID -19 result from an FDA -approved test within the 3 days prior to entering an SSA facility. Contractor employees who do not attest to being fully vaccinated (or who decline to respond to an attestation request), and who lack the required negative test result, will not be permitted into the facility. Contractor employees who are not fully vaccinated, and who are admitted to an SSA facility, must follow the safety protocols described in the \"Face Mask and Physical Distancing\" section listed below. Visitors Given the different safety protocols for individuals who are fully vaccinated and those who are not fully vaccinated, SSA will ask about the vaccination status of visitors to SSA facilities who are not seeking a public service or benefit. Individuals must attest to the truthfulness of the response they provide. SSA provides visitors with the Certification of Vaccination form when they enter an SSA facility. Visitors to SSA facilities who are not fully vaccinated or who decline to provide information about their vaccination status must provide proof of a negative COVID -19 test within the 3 days prior to entering an SSA facility. Visitors who do not attest to being fully vaccinated or who decline to respond, and who lack the required negative test result, will not be permitted into the fa cility. Visitors who are not fully vaccinated, and who are admitted to an SSA facility, must follow the safety protocols described in the \"Face Mask and Physical Distancing\" section listed below. Individuals seeking a public service or benefit (and their companions) Requirements related to vaccination status, and COVID -19 testing and results, do not apply to 10 members of the public entering an SSA facility to obtain a public service or benefit, including Social Security field offices and hearings offi ces. If they are not fully vaccinated, these individuals must comply with all relevant CDC guidance, including wearing a mask and physically distancing from other people. Telework and Remote Work SSA will utilize telework consistent with agency policies as articulated in the Personnel Policy Manual , and applicable collective bargaining agreements. Onsite work includes both portable and non-portable workloads. COVID -19 Coordination Teams The Office of the Commissi oner will continue to provide oversight and coordination in accordance with OMB M-21-15 and OMB M-21-25 guidance. The COVID -19 Coordination Team is a cross -agency team consisting of executives and staff from human resources, medical, legal, program operations, facilities, and health and safety experts. The team will meet regularly as necessary to review compliance with agency COVID -19 workplace safety plans and protocols, consider potential revisions to agency COVID -19 workplace safety plans and protocols pursuant to guidance from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force and the most up -to-date CDC guidelines, and evaluate any other operational needs related to COVID -19 workplace safety. The Team consults regularly with the Senior Procurement Executive and considers input from Facility Security Committees. We will continue to consult with experts in other agencies including the CDC and General Services Administration (GSA). Face Masks and Physical Distancing All SSA employees, contractors, visitors and members of the public will be required to wear masks, regardless of their asserted vac cination status, except w here contrary to law or addressed under the relevant reentry MOU . SSA will notify individuals of the following safety measures through signage in SSA facilities and on the SSA webpage. Vaccinated Individuals Fully vaccinated employees generally do not need to physically distance, except where required by Federal, State, local, Tribal, or territorial laws, rules, or regulations. Not Fully Vaccinated Individuals (or who decline to disclose vaccination status) Employees, contractor employees, and visitors, who are not fully vaccinated (or who decline to provide vaccination status) and all individuals seeking a public benefit or service who are admitted to an SSA facilit y must maintain a distance of at l east six feet from others at all times and wear a mask , except where prohibited by Federal, State, local, Tribal, or territorial 11 laws, rules, or regulations. Mask Guidelines For individuals who are required to wear a mask: Appropriate masks will be worn consistently and correctly (over mouth and nose). CDC recommends the following: disposable masks, masks that fit properly (snugly around the no se and chin with no large gaps around the sides of the face), masks made with breathable fabric (such as cotton), masks made with tightly woven fabric (i.e., fabrics that do not let light pass through when held up to a light source), masks with two or three layers, and masks with inner filter pockets. SSA will not allow novelty or non-protective masks, masks with ventilation valves, or face shields as a substitute for masks. SSA will provide exceptions consistent with CDC guidelines, including, but not limited to, when an individual is alone in an office with floor to ceiling walls and a closed door, or for a limited time when eating or drinking and maintaining distancing in accordance with CDC guidelines. Exceptions to the Face Mask Policy Exceptions to the face mask policy include visitors or individuals seeking a public benefit or service under 2 years old. When scheduling the appointment, if the visitor or individual seeking a public benefit or service is required to wear a face mask pursuant to agency protocols but reports being unable to wear a face mask, management will make alternative service plans (e.g., telephone service, contactless document drop off) and consult with the Medical Office (MO) for guidance, as necessary. Masked individuals may be asked to lower their masks briefly for identification purposes in compliance with safety and security requirements. If an employee reports being unable to wear a face mask due to a medical or religious reason, the manager will review the instructions in the management COVID -19 FAQ and engage in the reasonable accommodation process. Testing After a workplace exposure, SSA will refer employees to Community -based Testing Sites for COVID -19 for testing. Employees will be tested on duty time at no cost to the employee. Employees and contr actor employees who are fully vaccinated and have had close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID -19 will get tested 5 -7 days after exposure, even if they do not have symptoms. Contact Tracing 12 In coordination with the COVID -19 Coordination Team, our MO receives reports of possible in - office exposures and directs management about next steps including enhanced cleaning and notifications, when applicable. The MO will continue to work with public health departments concerning conta ct tracing and will work with management to issue notifications, when appropriate. With any notification, we protect the confidentiality of personal medical information consistent with Federal, State, and local privacy and confidentiality laws and regulati ons. Travel SSA employees will adhere strictly to CDC guidelines before, during, and after travel. The agency has made employees aware through a FAQ that official or personal travel may result in a mandatory quarantine before they are allowed to return to the workplace. Employees may be allowed to telework, provided with weather and safety leave if they traveled for official reasons and portable work is not available, or request personal leave if they traveled for personal reasons and portable work is not available. If an employee refuses to quarantine or refuses to take personal leave while under mandatory quarantine after personal travel, SSA may elect to bar the empl oyee from the workplace for the safety of others. For employees who are fully vaccinated, there are no Government -wide restrictions on travel (although internal SSA travel policies still apply). For employees who are not fully vaccinated or decline to provide information on their vaccination status , SSA will observe the following guidance, unless it is contrary to an accommodation to which an employee is legally entitled. Official domestic travel for such employees should be limited to only necessary mission -critical trips, and must be approved by the employee's Deputy Commissioner. This authority is further delegable to Associate Commissioners and Regional Commissioners. Internatio nal travel should also be avoided, if at all possible, unless it is mission critical, and must be approved by the Chief of Staff. The cost of testing required for official travel can be claimed in a travel voucher as a Miscellaneous Expense under agency travel policies. Meetings, Events, and Conferences SSA will avoid hosting in -person meetings, conferences, or events that will be attended by more than 50 participants, unless the event is mission -critical for the public benefit (e.g., enumeration, disaste r relief). When unavoidable, regardless of whether participants include members of the public, the Commissioner, in consultation with the COVID -19 Coordination Team, must approve the event. The Chief of Staff or designee must approve an SSA employee's attendance at a conference attended by more than 50 individuals. In-person attendees at any meetings, conferences, and events hosted by SSA, regardless of size, must be asked to provide information about vaccination status. In requesting this i nformation, SSA will comply with any applicable Federal laws, including requirements under the Privacy Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act. In-person attendees who are not fully vaccinated or decline to provide information about their vaccination status mu st provide proof of a negative COVID -19 test completed no later than the previous 3 days and comply with masking and 13 physical distancing requirements for individuals who are not fully vaccinated consistent with the requirements for visitors in the Face Mas ks and Physical Distancing section above. Individuals who fail to comply with these requirements may not be permitted to attend. In- person attendees must wear a mask in public indoor settings regardless of vaccination status. Symptom Monitoring and Screening If SSA employees, contractor employees, visitors, or individuals seeking a public service or benefit have symptoms consistent with COVID -19, they will no t enter an SSA facility. They will also be required to screen for exposures and comply with any CDC guidance related to quarantines or testing after travel. SSA employees and contractor employees working onsite will regularly complete self- screening. Visitors and individuals seeking a public service or benefit will be asked to follow posted signage to complete symptom screening before entering an SSA facility. Any individual, regardless of vaccination status, who develops any symptoms consistent with COVID -19 during the workday must immediately isolate, notify a supervisor, and promptly leave the workplace. Supervisors may contact the MO for advice. Quarantine, Isolation and Steps Following Exposure to Someone Suspected or Confirmed COVID -19 Any individual with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID -19 will be advised to isolate, pursuant to CDC guidelines. Employees and contractor employees who have had a close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID - 19 will follow CDC and State, local, and Tribal guidance for quarantine. If an employee is subject to isolation due to being infected with COVID -19 and is unab le to telework, the employee may request personal leave (e.g., sick leave, annual leave, credit hours). Confidentiality and Privacy All medical information collected from individuals, including vaccination information, test results, and any other informat ion obtained as a result of testing and symptom monitoring, will be treated in accordance with applicable laws and policies on confidentiality, privacy, and the security of information technology. Positive tests will be recorded for the OSHA Illness and Injury Log when appropriate. Managers may consult the MO on questions about medical information or concerns. Questions about legal authority to share medical information internally or externally may be directed to Office of the General Counsel (OGC), Offic e of General Law. When submitting questions to the MO or OGC, managers must exclude identifying information about individuals unless the MO or OGC requests it. Workplace Operations 14 Occupancy SSA may establish occupancy limits for specific offices as a means of facilitating physical distancing, depending on factors like vaccination status, public access, and mission requirements. Environmental Cleaning SSA will ensure regular cleaning of common use, high -touch, and high -density spaces, such as lobbies, restrooms, elevators, and stairwells. Office space that is in regular use will be cleaned regularly, and in accordance with CDC guidelines. Wipes and other Environmental Protection Agency -approved disinfectants will be made available for use by in dividuals to wipe down workstations and related personal property. Physical barriers, such as plexiglass shields, may be installed, where appropriate. In the event of a suspected or confirmed case of COVID -19 in the workplace, SSA will ensure enhanced environmental cleaning of the spaces that the individual occupied or accessed in accordance with CDC and, where applicable, GSA guidance. The Office of Budget, Finance, and Management or Office of Operations, in coordination with the COVID -19 Coordination Team and the MO, will determine the appropriate scope of workplace closures needed \u2014in some cases, it may be a suite or individual offices or part of a floor, in other cases, it may include an entire building. Hygiene Hand sanitizer will be readily available throughout workspaces. Hand sanitizers will contain at least 60 percent alcohol and be manufactured in accordance with the requirements o f the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ingredients will be listed on a \"Drug Facts\" label. SSA will ensure the hand sanitizer is not on the FDA's do not use list. Ventilation and Air Filtration SSA will consider modifications to ventilation systems in accordance with CDC guidance , especially as facility population density increases. To the extent feasible, indoor ventilation will be optimized to increase the proportion of outdoor air and improve filtration. SSA will consider deploying portable high -efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers for closed areas with public traffic like hearing rooms and higher -risk spaces. 15 Appendix 2: Telework eligibility for certain specific positions Position Position Description Number Number of Telework Days During Evaluation - Weekly (unless otherwise specified) OARO/AO Mail/file clerks 3 days OARO/AO Reprographics staff 2 days OBFM HQ Network Support Team 4 days OBFM/OSEP Watch Staff 0 Locksmiths 0 Fire Techs 0 Parking and Credentialing 2 days OBFM/OFLM/ OBM Electricians and Supervisors/Leaders 0 Construction and Maintenance Foreman 0 Maintenance and Repair Supervisor 0 Custodial Worker 0 Heavy Mobile Equipment Mechanic 0 Carpenters 0 Lead AV Specialist 0 Maintenance Mechanic 0 Pipefitters 0 Utility Systems Repair Operators and Supervisors 0 OBFM/OFLM/OMLM Freight Rate Specialists 0 Materials Handlers 0 Auto Workers 0 Motor Vehicle Operators 0 Transportation Specialist 0 Reader Assistant4 0 Control Clerk (duplicating) 0 Printing Tech (duplicating 0 Lithographic Worker (duplicating) 0 Management Analysts (see exceptions below) 4 days Distribution Facilities Specialist 4 days Supervisory Distribution Facilities Specialist (Division Director) 4 days Inventory Management Specialist 4 days 4 Depends on telework schedule of the Employee with Disability 16 Lead Inventory Management Specialist 4 days Team Leader (Personal Property) 3 days Management Analysts (Personal Property) 3 days General Supply Specialists 3 days Supervisory Management Analyst (Braille Supervisor) 3 days Transportation Officer 2 days Deputy Transportation Officer 2 days Braille Technician 2 days Management Analyst (Duplicating) 2 days Supervisory Distribution Facilities Specialist (Warehouse and Loading Dock Supervisors) 1 day Mail and Duplicating Operations Specialist (Duplicating Supervisor) 1 day OCOMM Correspondence Policy and Procedures Analyst 1F0610 1F1320 4 days Electronic Support Staff 07C101S 01D2330 4 days OHO Hearing Office Management 3-45 days Hearing Office Support Staff 3-44 days Hearing Office Systems Administrators 3-44 days Administrative Law Judges 3-44 days Decision Writers 5 days OHR Readers6 Assistants6 Operations Some Employees Ineligible for Telework7 0 Field Office - All Eligible Employees 2 days TSC - All Eligible Employees 4 days WSU - All Eligible Employees 4 days DPB/DPU - All Eligible Employees 4 days 5 Based on in -office service needs, to include in-person hearings. 6 Depends on telework schedule of the Employee with Disability 7 See list of Operations employees ineligible for telework in Appendix 3. 17 PC 4 days Systems Computer Assistant 6D0540 0 Data Centers (eVault, SSC, NSC) 01D1100 3 days 18 Appendix 3: List of Operations employees ineligible for telework Position Title Grade Position Number Region Component Incumbents Accounting Technician 07 95S49 New York 04 MOS 1 Admin Asst (OA) 06 Kansas Equip Mech 10 39T14 San Francisco 04 MOS 1 Cash Clerk 04 3C341 OCO 05 PSC 1 Claims Assistant 05 94L36 02 Claims Assistant (0A) 98K95 Dallas 02 Comp Oper Team Leader 09 28A28 OCO 05 PSC 3 Control Clerk 04 38A46 Atlanta Control Clerk 03 39930 05 PSC 2 Custodial Work 05 PSC San Francisco 04 MOS 1 Enum&Fin Supervisor York 05 PSC 1 FINAL 1/14/22 1 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING This is a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) by and between the Social Security Administration (SSA), Office of Hearings Operations (OHO), (hereinafter referred to as the \"Agency,\" \"OHO,\" or \"Management \"), and the Association of Administrative Law Judges, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers , AFL -CIO (hereinafter referred to as \"AALJ\" or \"Union\") and collectively referred to as the \"Parties. \" The purpose of this MOU is to address substantial changes in the bargaining unit judges' conditions of employment concerning Administrative Law Judges ( ALJs ) reentry to the workplace and Workplace Safety Plan 2.0 (WSP 2.0) . Since March of 2020 , ALJs have worked remotely under the Agency's Work at Home by Quarantine policy and have only conducted telephonic or online video hearings (OVH). Section A. Reporting to the Worksite 1. During the reentry period associated with this MOU, ALJs will be required to report to their Permanent Duty Site (\"worksite\") only on days when the ALJ is scheduled to hold in -person hearings. In-person hearing days will not be mixed with hearings that can be conducted remotely without the prior approval of the ALJ. 2. ALJs may voluntarily report to the worksite to conduct other hearings, including Online Video Hearings (OVH) and telephonic hearings , at their own discretion. An ALJ will typically hold such hearings from the ALJ's office so long as the office is fully equipped for such hearings. If the ALJ's office is not suitable for holding remote hearings, or the ALJ wishes to use other space, the ALJ may coordinate with ma nagement on the use of an available hearing room or other suitable space for conducting a remote hearing. Unless a manager will be present and serving as Officer -In-Charge (OIC), the ALJ will serve as OIC and comply with OIC policy and procedures. 3. ALJs ma y voluntarily report to the worksite on non -hearing days at their own discretion , unless a local evacuation order necessitates remote work , enhanced restrictions are in place due to a confirmed COVID -19 infection in the hearing office , or the office is clo sed for other reasons . Unless a manager will be present and serving as OIC, the ALJ will serve as OIC and comply with OIC policy and procedures. 4. ALJs who report to the worksite to conduct hearings can, at their own discretion, work the entire day at the worksite or choose to c omplete the remainder of their workday at their Alternative Duty Station (\"ADS\"). Travel time between the worksite and ADS is non-duty time . 5. During the reentry period, an ALJ's ADS is not restricted by its distance from the worksite. The Agency is not res ponsible for any per diem or travel costs between an ALJ's ADS and the worksite. ALJs will hold in -person hearings at the ALJ's assigned FINAL 1/14/22 2 worksite as part of their normal hearing schedule. 6. ALJs will report to the worksite to resolve ID badge/credential or technology issues that cannot be resolved remotely. The ALJ and local management team will arrange a specific date and time for the ALJ to come to the worksite , including allowing the ALJ sufficient time to make travel arrangements i f needed . To the extent practicable, any credential issues will be addressed on days when the ALJ is scheduled to be in the office to conduct hearings. 7. All ALJs will be allowed to telework under the terms of this MOU so long as the ALJ is not subject to a limiting condition under the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6502(a)(2) . 8. ALJs who use Agency equipment at the ALJ's ADS will be allowed to keep this Agency equipment at the ADS during the time period covered by this MOU. Section B. Health and Safety for Hearings 1. OHO will make hand sanitizer and disposable masks available to all claimants prior to entering the local hearing office . With the exception of an adult accompanying a child to a hearing for the purpose of obtaining child disability benefits or individuals requiring special assistance or accom modations , no one other than a claimant scheduled for an in - person hearing and the claimant's representative will be allowed to enter the hearing room . Any claimant, contractor, or other visitor who enters the hearing office will be required to wear a mas k as described by the CDC (currently available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/prevent -getting -sick/about -face- coverings.html) . 2. OHO will ensure that all contractors and visitors to a hearing office are properly screened as follows before entering the hearing office: a. They have been advised of the need to self -screen that they have not experienced any possible COVID -19 symptoms; b. They will be advised to self -screen for fever and other symptoms and about the safety protocols applicable to their vaccination status during the hearing scheduling process and upon arrival via signage. 3. Signage will be posted at the hearing office entrance, by the check -in windows, and in the waiting room reminding all visit ors to a hearing office that they are required to wear a mask at all times. Office staff working the check -in windows will remind all visitors to the office that they must wear a mask at all times . Signage will be posted at the entrance to every hearing room about the need to properly wear a mask (i.e. over the mouth and nose) . FINAL 1/14/22 3 4. Consistent with 20 CFR 404.936 and 20 CFR 416. 1436, an ALJ may adjourn a hearing that is in progress and continue it at a later date . Nothing in this MOU will be construed to restrict an ALJ's right to postpone or adjourn a hearing. If a claimant in a hearing room continues to refuse to properly wear a mask while in a hearing room after reasonable warning from staff and/or the ALJ, the ALJ has the right to postpone the remainder of the hearing and direct the cl aimant to leave the hearing office immediately . If a contractor or other hearing participant such as a representative refuses to properly wear a required mask in a hearing room after reasonable warning, the ALJ may stop the hearin g and reschedule it. 5. Any individual, regardless of vaccination status, who displays any symptoms consistent with COVID -19 while in a hearing room must promptly leave the hearing office. If the individual is a claimant or other essential party to the hearing, the ALJ shall adjourn and/or postpone the hearing. 6. Visitors and contractors will be advised to refrain from eating or drinking while in the hearing rooms , unless they have a medical need to do so. 7. In each hearing room where there is more than one person, p rotective barriers such as splash screens made of plexiglass will be installed at the ALJ bench and at each participant area. 8. While in the hearing room, a ll participants to a hearing will be placed at a distance from one another as recommended by the CDC, currently no less than six feet apart, or whatever distance the CDC recommends in the future . Appropriate distancing markings shall be placed by the Agency to clearly identify appropriate spacing. 9.

FINAL 1/14/22 8 For the Agency: For the Union: Eddie Taylor Som Ramrup SECURITY MEMORANDUM Date: March To: All Hearings Operations Managers From: Patrick Nagle /s/ Chief Administrative Law Judge Subject: Scheduling In-Office Hearings--INFORMATION The Acting Commissioner set the agency's reentry date for March 30, 2022. The Office of Hearings Operations (OHO) will offer limited in-person hearings throughoutthe remainder of fiscal year 2022. Management administrative law judges (ALJ) beganconducting limited in-person hearings in March.To ensure that we remain flexible enough to adjust to evolving COVID-19 conditionsand maximize available hearing rooms for all service-delivery channels [e.g.,telephone, online video hearing (OVH), video teleconference (VTC), and in-person]this information provides a framework and necessary steps for the resumption of in-person hearings. The agency will continue to monitor COVID-19 conditions and willdetermine if evolving conditions warrant any changes to this scheduling plan. We willprovide additional details as we work through this transition.Resumption of Limited In-Person Hearings Framework May, June, July: Hearing offices may utilize a maximum of 50% of available hearingrooms in a hearing office per day. This calculation includes individuals participating ina VTC hearing. ALJs may be scheduled for a maximum of six (6) in-person hearingsper day, being mindful of keeping enough time between hearings to allow for cleaningand to allow for appropriate distancing in the reception area.August, September: Hearing offices may utilize 66% (two-thirds) of available hearingrooms per day for in-person hearings and there will be no limitation on the number ofin-person-hearings held per day. In-Person Hearings: Guidelines \u00b7 Hearing Offices are only required to be open to the public on days/times in-person hearings are conducted. Hearing offices should be prepared to assist members of the public (e.g. dropping off medical evidence or other paperwork) on days/timeswhen the office is open for in-person hearings. A guard must be on-site duringthese days/times. \u00b7 All visitors to the Hearing Office are subject to the COVID-19 protocols and screening questions posted on the Hearing Office door and provided in theCOVID-19 protocols notice insert. (b) (2)\u00b7 Consistent with Memoranda of Understanding between the agency and AFGE/IFPTE/NTEU, employees may choose to work in the hearing office on days when no in-person hearings are scheduled. An officer-in-charge or manager mustbe onsite whenever employees are working in the office. In-Person Hearings: Scheduling Factors and Considerations Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judges (HOCALJs) and hearing officemanagement teams need to take extra steps to ensure proper planning andscheduling during our resumption of in-person hearings: 1. The Offices of the Chief Administrative Law Judge and Budget, Facilities and Security will provide each Region with a list of priority cases to schedule forin-person hearings. Hearing offices and centralized scheduling units (CSUs)will only schedule in-person hearings from the priority lists provided to theRegions. 2. ALJs will provide hearing availability calendars consistent with normal office procedures. ALJs may not specify certain days as \"in-person,\" \"remote,\" or\"mixed\" on their availability calendars. Ultimately, HOCALJs will determine\"in-person\" days in consultation with ALJs and balance the various factorsaddressed herein. 3. HOCALJs should ensure that ALJs are available for at least one (1) day of in-person hearings per week (or monthly equivalent, i.e., two (2) days of in- person hearings every other week, etc.).[1] a. HOCALJs should ensure that all ALJs in the hearing office are equally sharing the workload of in-person hearings to ensure proper rotation ofcases and avoid issues such as forum shopping. b. In-person hearings will not take any priority over other hearing modalities such as telephone, OVH, or VTC. The goal is to serveclaimants via all available modalities. c. ALJs must provide sufficient availability during the month to address all hearing modalities. d. IMPORTANT: If an ALJ conducts 4 or 5 days of in-person hearings during a single week and will be working in their alternate duty station(ADS) the balance of that month, there may be locality pay implicationsif the ALJ is residing or working in an ADS outside of the locality-payarea of the hearing office. If residing outside of the locality pay area orworking in an ADS outside of the locality pay area, an employee mustbe scheduled to report to the Hearing Office (permanent duty station) atleast twice per pay period in order to retain locality pay. Contact yourRegional Attorney if you have questions regarding this issue. 4. HOCALJs should follow the normal process of applying ALJ seniority to determine which ALJ will utilize hearing rooms on a given day if there are conflicts for available hearing rooms, based upon the schedules submitted.HOCALJs will advise ALJs, as necessary, if they need to provide alternatehearing days, to ensure effective utilization of hearing rooms in accordancewith the limitations noted above. 5. HOCALJs should determine if ALJs are willing to hear a mix of \"in-person\" and \"remote\" (i.e., telephone, OVH, VTC) hearings on submitted hearing days\u2014which will facilitate greater flexibility in filling dockets. This choice is up tothe ALJ under Section A. 1. of the MOU between the Association of Administrative Law Judges and OHO, so management cannot mandate this orin any way pressure ALJs to do so.a. If an ALJ agrees to \"mixed hearing days,\" then available hearing days could be utilized for a combination of remote hearings and in-person hearings on a given day. b. If an ALJ does not agree to \"mixed hearing days,\" then available hearing days will be utilized only for one hearing modality (e.g., all in-person orall remote hearings) on a given day. 6. For in-person hearings taking place 6/23/22 forward, the CSUs will be responsible for scheduling all hearing modalities. a. Management (to include Hearing Office Coordinator) will communicate ALJ \"in- person\" days to the CSU for hearings to be scheduledbeginning 6/23/22. b. Management (to include Hearing Office Coordinator) should provide the Hearing Room number for each ALJ in-person day, as well asindicating if the ALJ is available for \"mixed\" hearings, to the CSU. 7. Consistent with Section A.2 of the MOU between the agency and IFPTE, ALJs may choose to work from the hearing office on days when they are conductingremote hearings, or no hearings at all. If management authorizes an ALJ orvideo hearing reporter to use a hearing room to conduct remote hearings (i.e.,telephone, OVH, VTC), they will not count as occupying a hearing room forpurposes of the 50% or 66% in-person utilization limitation for the time-periodnoted above. 8. Unused hearing rooms can be utilized by claimants for OVH or traditional VTC hearings. If a claimant is scheduled to use a hearing room to participate in aremote hearing (i.e., OVH or VTC), this will count as a utilized hearing room for purposes of the 50% or 66% hearing room utilization limitation for thetime-period noted above. If a claimant is scheduled to use a hearing room for OVH, VTC, or a folder review, on a day when the office is notconducting in-person hearings, management must ensure a guard andappropriate staff are on-site. a. OESSI is exploring solutions to allow claimants to utilize agency equipment for OVH hearings at the hearing office. Though this willlikely be a rare occurrence, please reach out to your Regional ITS forassistance on a case-by-case basis. Your support and patience are appreciated as we return to in-person hearings. Theseprecautions will provide for social distancing and avoid crowding in hearing officespaces, safety of employees and the public, and provide multiple service modalities forclaimants.Please forward questions through your local management chain. Regional office staffmay direct questions to cc: Regional Office Management Team (b) (2) (b) (2)[1] As a reminder, HOCALJs should timely process any reasonable accommodation requests, including those which would delay an ALJ's ability to return to in-office hearings.
