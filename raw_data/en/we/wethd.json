Like your family doctor, naturopathic doctors can order and interpret laboratory blood tests and perform physical examinations to arrive at a clinical diagnosis for a variety of health issues. Additionally, naturopathic doctors are trained in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease using natural therapies that include botanical medicine, clinical nutrition, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, physical therapies, Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture, and lifestyle counselling. The use of these additional methods of examination and history-taking allow naturopathic doctors to understand the underlying root of disease. If you're tired of being brushed off by a medical system that doesn't seem to listen to you, or if you are worried about the side effects of common pharmaceutical drugs, then it's time to consider a more natural, integrative way of looking at your health.
