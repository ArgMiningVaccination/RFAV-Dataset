The participants will be a group of young people living in the community (aged 14 - 25 years) who have experienced early onset psychosis or who are at ultra-high risk for developing psychosis. The project is a comprehensive, integrated lifestyle intervention that includes a dedicated exercise physiologist and dietician. The trial will quantify whether metabolic and functional markers of physical health in young people who have experienced early onset psychosis, or are at ultra-high risk of developing psychosis, can be improved by a combined practical dietary and physical activity intervention. | |2020/21 amount ||$199,341 | | || | |Administering Institution ||Australian National University | |Project Title the Canberra Brain Cancer Clinical-Research Collaborative | |Description ||The project aims to enable precision drug discovery to improve outcomes for brain cancer patients, not only in Canberra but throughout the world. Through \"Brain Cancer Biobanking Australia\" (BCBA) it aims to create the repository of tumour material with sophisticated genomic data for each patient treated at The Canberra Hospital in accordance with International best practice. The outcome will guide laboratory-based precision drug discovery approaches, and enable a move towards personalised brain cancer treatments. Thus, support from The Australian Brain Cancer Mission, will ensure patients in the Canberra region (including patients in NSW treated at Canberra Regional Cancer Centre, CRCC) are provided, for the first time, with the opportunity of cutting-edge genomics-based analysis of their brain cancer and, thus, access to current clinical trials and emerging treatments. | |2020/21 amount ||$299,920 | | || | |Administering Institution ||Australian National University | |Project Title ||The Big Sleep ACT Project: a novel, ACT-focussed data resource for interdisciplinary research on sleep health | |Description ||This research project will transform a large body of existing clinical data into an organised and accessible dataset, which will support future basic and applied research across multiple clinical and technical disciplines. | The proposed dataset has the potential to support a broad range of discoveries about Canberrans' sleep health and the effectiveness of treatment for sleep disorders, as well as deliver insights into a range of chronic conditions such as obesity, mental health, and cardiovascular disease, due to their strong association with sleep disorders. |2020/21 amount ||$125,000 | | || | |Administering Institution ||University of Canberra | |Project Title ||Multidisciplinary brain cancer rehabilitation, holistic assessment, and multimodal interventions to address survivorship needs: Brain Trial | |Description ||The project brings together different healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, psychologists, exercise physiologists and dietitians) and researchers with expertise in cancer care to deliver a 'timely needs-based' model of supportive care to improve function, physical and psychological well-being, and overall quality of life. | The needs-based holistic model of supportive care in this study promotes shared decision-making and aligning treatment plans with patient goals which can provide relief from distressing symptoms, while promoting rehabilitation of the consequences of treatment. The information gained from this study will help to inform a future, much larger study across Australia. |2020/21 amount ||$288,959 | | || | |Administering Institution ||Canberra Health Services |Project colorectal cancer | |Description || | Precision medicine can play an important role in cancer management. This project seeks to understand and refine treatment options for colorectal cancer patients with metastatic disease. Preclinical and clinical data has revealed a significant proportion of colorectal cancer patients who can benefit markedly from a new wave of immunotherapies (IO) that have transformed cancer treatment. Furthermore, these types of IO may enhance a rarely observed radiotherapy (RT)-driven immune responses that may promote systemic tumour eradication. It is also likely some treatments may be better suited to specific cohorts of colorectal cancer patients. Therefore, there is clear need for development of immune-based biomarkers for prognostication and evidence-based personalisation of the novel RT-IO schedules in colorectal cancer patients prior to the clinical adoption of RT-IO combinations. |2020/21 amount ||$283,733 | | || | |Administering Institution ||University of Canberra | |Project Title ||Cardiac Rehabilitation for transient ischaemic Attack and Mild-Stroke: the CRAMS trial | |Description ||The University of Canberra (UC) will partner with Canberra Health Services and Calvary Public Hospital, supported by the Stroke Foundation and Heart Foundation, to investigate the effectiveness of a 6-week integrated (TIA, mild-stroke, heart disease) traditional exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program (Cardiovascular rehabilitation) at the UC Health Clinics. | |2020/21 amount ||$163,179 | | || | |Administering Institution ||Australian National University | |Project Title ||Phase One Clinical Trial, and pre-clinical optimisation, of a novel cancer immunotherapy combination. | |Description ||The project aims to improve treatment outcomes, and the quality of life of cancer patients. It also aims to generate valuable data from both our pre-clinical and clinical study which will contribute to basic scientific knowledge about cancer immunotherapy. | |2020/21 amount ||$292,000 | | || | University | |Project Title ||Co-Designing Australia's First Fixed-Site Drug Checking Service - A collaboration between consumers, services, government and academics | |Description ||Drug checking services (also known as pill testing) are a health intervention aimed at performing chemical analyses to assess the contents of illicit substances. Importantly, drug content analyses are generally also accompanied by information on reducing the harms of drugs. This synergy of drug checking and health information aims to minimise the risk of injury or death from drug use. | This project will be used to directly inform the design and implementation of a novel health service in the ACT. The study design involves innovative co-design methodology to ensure that the vulnerable Canberrans that the service intends to help are engaged and empowered to play a role in its implementation. |2020/21 amount ||$63,669 | | || | |Administering University | |Project Title ||Young People's Journeys around Mental Health and Mental Services Study (JAMMed): Longitudinal Qualitative Study | |Description || | Mental illness is a serious and growing concern for young people in the ACT. Vulnerable young people, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with culturally and linguistically diverse background, those with disability, and those who are homeless, experience worse access to care. As they mature, there are also risks when young people transition to adult services. The study will identify potential areas of improvement so that all young people who need mental health services can access appropriate, affordable and streamlined treatment. |2020/21 amount ||$296,370 | "}
