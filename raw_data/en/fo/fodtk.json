Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00113)], the general consensus about its beneficence has not been reached among people [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00113), [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00113), [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00113)]. In countries with well-established immunisation programmes, vaccines are said to be \"victims of their own success\", because low incidences of diseases now prevented with vaccines has diminished the experience of historical burdens of several devastating communicable diseases [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00113)]. Nowadays, a wide variety of opinions about vaccination exist; some people are against it in principle, others are against its mandatoriness or against the involvement of the state; yet others are just concerned about its safety issues and maybe prefer alternative vaccination programmes or delayed vaccination [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00113), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00113), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00113)]. Therefore, different terms for parents who lack compliance with vaccination are used, though not consistently [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00113), [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00113), [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00113), [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00113)]. The term \"anti-vaxxers\" refers to a broad group of people, who are against vaccination for whatever reason [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00113)]. Terms \"vaccine-refusal\" or \"vaccine-reluctancy\" represent the anti-vaccination extreme and define individuals who fail to vaccinate themselves or their children for different reasons [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00113), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00113)]. \"Vaccine-hesitancy\" is a term that covers the continuum of opinions between pro- and anti-vaccination extremes. Vaccine-hesitant individuals do not refuse vaccination in principle but are concerned about its safety/efficiency or maybe just prefer alternative vaccination schedules [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00113), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00113), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00113)]. In our review, we use the term \"vaccine-hesitant parents\", because it applies to the whole spectrum of different opinions about vaccination. [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00113), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00113), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00113)]. However, a large-scale retrospective study, published in 2020 in The Lancet, reported that confidence in the importance, safety and effectiveness of vaccines improved in some countries across the world and fell in the others in the last few years [ [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00113)]. The percentage of vaccine-refusing people is lower than vaccine-hesitant and is estimated to around 5% [ [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00113)]. Vaccine hesitancy is, especially in high-income countries, one of the most important reasons for lower immunisation coverage, which results in outbreaks of vaccine-controllable diseases [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00113), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00113), [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00113), [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00113)]. Due to high contingency, several measles outbreaks across Europe and North America in recent years raised attention to low vaccination coverage in particular countries [ [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00113), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00113), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00113)]. WHO declared vaccine hesitancy, defined as the reluctance or refusal to vaccine despite the availability of vaccines, as one of the world's top ten global health threats in 2019 [ [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00113)]. There are many reasons why parents might be hesitant or refuse to vaccinate their children, including worries about a vaccine's safety and the maturity of a child's immune system, absence of the disease in a certain population, motives of pharmaceutical industry, diminished trust in public health system, misinformation, perception of coercion, religious beliefs, etc. [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00113), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00113)]. [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00113), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00113), [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00113)], fair global vaccine allocation and development [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00113)], vaccination for travellers and workers [ [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00113), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00113), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00113)] and ethical justification of measures to maintain herd immunity of the population [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00113), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00113), [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00113)]. At the level of an individual, there can be conflicts between respect for parents' autonomy, the child's best interest and just contribution to herd immunity [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00113), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00113)]. Although every country has its own vaccination policy and recommendations, each situation when treating children of vaccine-hesitant parents is unique and needs an individual and personal approach [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00113), [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00113)]. [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00113), [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00113)]. However, there are many possible ways of approaching bioethical problems and none of them is ideal. Despite some criticism regarding the four-principles approach [ [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00113), [35](#B35-vaccines-09-00113), [36](#B36-vaccines-09-00113), [37](#B37-vaccines-09-00113)], the framework is widely accepted and compatible with a variety of moral theories [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-00113)]. Although the approach is basically simple, as ethics should be in order to serve different profiles of people, it can also be complexified [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-00113)]. Beauchamp and Childress claim that their framework captures major moral considerations that are essential starting points for biomedical ethics, but only the process of specification and balancing broad principles and rules leads to the concrete moral judgments [ [39](#B39-vaccines-09-00113)]. The four principles theory, as also other bioethical theories, should maybe not be understood as action-guiding but rather as procedures by which one's decisions can achieve a reasonable degree of moral justification [ [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00113)]. The approach to ethics of vaccination, developed in this paper, could; therefore, help healthcare providers and also decision-makers at various levels to better understand ethical issues and values at stake, and suggest them a more systematic and better defined way of ethical deliberation to reach best possible solutions [ [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00113), [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113)]. 2. Respect for Autonomy [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113), [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00113), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00113), [44](#B44-vaccines-09-00113)]. This principle is a fundamental ethical and political concept especially in countries with western tradition over the last 50 years [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113), [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00113), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00113)]. However, it is not an absolute principle and should not represent present-day individualism, as some critics have argued, but should always be balanced by other principles, taking into account social responsibilities and communal goals [ [39](#B39-vaccines-09-00113)]. In practice, autonomy is exercised through informed consent or informed refusal [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113), [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00113)]. There are at least four mandatory criteria that need to be fulfilled for its legitimacy: decision making capacity of a patient, adequate disclosure of information with its adequate understanding and voluntariness [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113), [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00113), [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00113)]. In the paediatric setting, when patients do not have appropriate decisional capacity for informed consent, two other important concepts were endorsed by the policy statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics (published in 1995, reaffirmed in 2016): parental permission and child's assent [ [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00113), [48](#B48-vaccines-09-00113)]. The latter gains its value with child's maturation, until full decision making capacity is assigned to an adolescent or young adult [ [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00113), [49](#B49-vaccines-09-00113)]. In the ethics of vaccination, the degree of respect for parents' autonomy is one of the key issues at stake. In many cases, vaccine hesitancy or refusal is a consequence of insufficient or inappropriate information, its misunderstanding or presence of manipulation, which constrain one's autonomy [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00113), [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00113)]. In this section, we will go through the main criteria for autonomous decision making from the perspective of vaccination. 2.1. Decision Making Capacity [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113)]. Regarding vaccination, it is mostly parents who make decisions on behalf of their children, because the majority of vaccinations are scheduled in early childhood [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113), [50](#B50-vaccines-09-00113)]. However, because a state also has a duty and interest in protecting a child from harm, it can challenge parental authority in situations in which a child is put at risk (the doctrine of parens patriae) [ [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00113)]. The degree of parent's autonomy depends on a type of planned intervention (or a type of vaccine); the higher a ratio between benefit and burden (having in mind the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence), the less decisive parents' autonomy is, and vice versa ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00113-f001)). The role of parental autonomy is also affected by the principle of justice (in the context of vaccination, the need to contribute to the herd immunity in a population is its important part, which will be dealt with in the Discussion section). 2.2. Disclosure of Information and Adequate Understanding [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00113)]. Lack of information, misunderstanding or false information are common causes for vaccine hesitancy or refusal [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00113), [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00113)]. Studies have shown that parents who delayed or refused vaccines do not consider the child's health care provider as a reliable information source and are more likely to seek vaccine information on the Internet [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00113), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00113), [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00113)]. Prior to burdening parents with responsibility, which comes together with autonomy, it is the responsibility of accountable public health structures and its professionals and also of individual clinicians to provide adequate, reliable and understandable information about vaccination [ [52](#B52-vaccines-09-00113)]. Improved parents' education and their adequate informing play a key role in the promotion of vaccination and enable the parents to make responsible immunisation decisions [ [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00113), [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00113), [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00113)]. Trust of the society in scientific evidence about vaccines, in the health care system and in vaccination policy is crucial, but not self-evident. It needs to be restored and maintained by provision of transparent information about vaccines, consistent attitudes of scientists and health care professionals and by the government taking responsibility for individuals affected by side effects [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00113), [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00113)]. Confidence is both a means and a result of ethically justified and efficient public health activities [ [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00113)]. Additionally, a trustful relationship between medical personnel and parents is also important. Listening carefully to parent's concerns and provision of clear information about risks and benefits of vaccination can help hesitant parents to understand principles of vaccination and, with their consent, to obviate ethical dilemmas of vaccine refusal [ [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00113), [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00113)]. However, because time meant for consultation with parents prior to vaccination is limited and it is often not possible to address all the parents' concerns, a systematic approach is preferable (e.g., by social media or in organized forms of education about vaccination) [ [57](#B57-vaccines-09-00113)]. 2.3. Voluntariness [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113), [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00113)]. Many of them do not threaten autonomous choice, even more, they are a fundamental part of decision making (so called \"noncontrolling influence\") [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113)]. But some factors may limit one's autonomy (\"controlling influence\"), and they also appear among reasons for vaccination hesitancy (i.e., conspiracy theories and family members' pressure) [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00113), [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113)]. These reasons need to be recognised and, if possible, avoided. A question arises, what is the relationship between autonomy and authority of behaviour prescribing organizations and traditions (i.e., government, religion, medical authority). Some claim that they are incompatible, but others see a conflict only when authority has not been properly delegated or accepted [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113), [58](#B58-vaccines-09-00113)]. 2.4. Conscientious Objection of Parents and Medical Personnel [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00113), [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113), [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00113), [59](#B59-vaccines-09-00113)]. It is questionable if parents should be entitled to assert conscientious objection to vaccination, and, if so, what constraints this entitlement should be subject to [ [60](#B60-vaccines-09-00113), [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00113)]. Clarke et al. states that conscientious objection to vaccination for severe or highly contagious diseases is justified only in cases when the rate of its assertion does not threaten herd immunity [ [60](#B60-vaccines-09-00113)]. In 2019 there were 45 states in the USA which allowed non-medical exemptions from immunisation [ [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00113)]. Among European countries with mandatory vaccination policy, only two of them allowed non-medical exemptions in 2020 [ [63](#B63-vaccines-09-00113)]. [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113), [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00113), [65](#B65-vaccines-09-00113)]. It is exercised through right to refuse certain procedures or treatments on conscientious grounds. Because conscientious objection can contradict physician's duties and may even limit patient's access to health care, this right is subject to certain restrictions [ [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00113), [66](#B66-vaccines-09-00113)]. Some medical practitioners across the world refuse to treat children that are not vaccinated. Because this can affect access of unvaccinated children to health care, justification of applying conscientious objection in this case is debatable [ [67](#B67-vaccines-09-00113), [68](#B68-vaccines-09-00113)]. 3. Nonmaleficence [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113), [69](#B69-vaccines-09-00113)]. In accordance with this principle, it is first needed to evaluate the harm or risk for harm of the proposed intervention, which is acceptable only when outweighed by benefits [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113), [69](#B69-vaccines-09-00113)]. Vaccination is a minimally invasive and safe procedure, but there are some important aspects that need to be assessed according to the principle of nonmaleficence. 3.1. Adverse Events [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00113)]. Because they are usually administered to healthy children and are only potentially beneficial to them, any adverse event has a negative impact on the risk:benefit ratio [ [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00113), [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00113)]. The most of adverse events are mild (i.e., pain and swelling at the injection site, mild fever, rash or syncope) [ [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00113)]. Anaphylactic reaction happens in approximately one per 1 million doses [ [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00113)]. Some other rare severe adverse events are febrile seizures, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated varicella infection in rotavirus vaccine [ [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00113), [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00113), [73](#B73-vaccines-09-00113)]. Rarer adverse effects are mostly observed only after vaccine licensure, with continuous monitoring [ [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00113)]. There are several independent bodies entitled for pursuance of this sensitive task; GACVS (Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety) is based in Geneva and gives advice on vaccine safety to WHO, while two main programs in the U.S. are VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System), run by CDC and FDA, and Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) [ [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00113), [74](#B74-vaccines-09-00113)]. Because incorrect associations between certain vaccines and adverse effects were made in the past, a couple of myths have developed, which have fostered mistrust about vaccines [ [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00113)]. A widely prevalent one is association between MMR vaccine and autism, which was rejected with strong evidence [ [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00113), [75](#B75-vaccines-09-00113)]. A solution to misconceptions about vaccines is providing reliable data on any possible adverse event and counselling parents about their concerns [ [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00113)]. 3.2. Contraindications for Immunisation [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00113)]. Contraindications can be temporary (i.e., current therapies (high dose steroids, chemotherapy ...), pregnancy (for live attenuated vaccines) and reactivation of autoimmune disease) or permanent (i.e., allergy to vaccine's ingredient, serious adverse events to a prior dose of vaccine and immunodeficiency (for live attenuated vaccines)) [ [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00113), [76](#B76-vaccines-09-00113)]. When there might be an increased risk for adverse effect, vaccination should be delayed or performed with caution in order to react properly [ [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00113)]. Examples of precautions are a mild adverse event to a prior dose of vaccine and acute moderate to severe illness with or without fever [ [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00113), [76](#B76-vaccines-09-00113)]. Some conditions are wrongly perceived as contraindications (e.g., mild to moderate local reaction, current antimicrobial treatment, preterm birth and chronic diseases) [ [76](#B76-vaccines-09-00113)]. Clear guidelines need to be accessible to everyone involved in vaccination in order to avoid such misconceptions and secure both safety and consistency in vaccination [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00113), [76](#B76-vaccines-09-00113)]. 3.3. Vaccine Development [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00113), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00113), [77](#B77-vaccines-09-00113), [78](#B78-vaccines-09-00113)]. Because children have limited capacity of understanding and may be subject to coercion, they are considered a vulnerable population [ [79](#B79-vaccines-09-00113)]. Therefore, special attention and certain restrictions in trial design are needed in order to protect them [ [77](#B77-vaccines-09-00113), [79](#B79-vaccines-09-00113)]. On the other hand, children are owed optimal and novel treatment options, which makes clinical trials in the paediatric population unavoidable and essential [ [79](#B79-vaccines-09-00113), [80](#B80-vaccines-09-00113)]. 4. Beneficence [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113), [81](#B81-vaccines-09-00113)]. It is a physician's duty to apply a treatment or procedure that he or she recognizes as a patient's best interest [ [81](#B81-vaccines-09-00113)]. This principle is an upgrade of the principle of nonmaleficence, because it requires healthcare providers to take positive steps in helping their patients [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113)]. Beneficence is the basis for people's trust in the healthcare system and medical personnel, which is necessary for a constructive patient-physician relationship and is crucial also for efficient immunisation programmes [ [82](#B82-vaccines-09-00113)]. The goal of providing benefit can be applied not only to individual patients, but also to a society as a whole (e.g., in researches or vaccination) [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113)]. From Individual's to Public Health Benefit of Vaccination [83](#B83-vaccines-09-00113)]. But since in many countries' vaccination programmes have been so successful, such that these diseases do not represent a direct risk anymore, the beneficial effect of vaccination has become less obvious [ [83](#B83-vaccines-09-00113)]. When weighing risks and benefits of vaccination for an individual child in a population with low immunity rates or for non-communicable infectious diseases (e.g., tetanus and tick-borne meningoencephalitis), the benefits strongly outweigh risks [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00113)]. On the other hand, when the level of herd immunity is high, vaccination of a single child has almost negligible beneficial effect for him or her [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00113)]. However, because this is a result of an already established herd immunity, a risk:benefit analysis needs to include public health aspect (i.e., benefit for other individuals). Just contribution to benefits of vaccination is discussed in the following section. 5. Justice [81](#B81-vaccines-09-00113)]. Equitability means that persons in like circumstances are treated similarly, while distributive justice means fair distribution of limited healthcare resources among patients [ [81](#B81-vaccines-09-00113)]. Criteria used in practice are not absolute but can change during time of emergency or crisis (e.g., in a pandemic, disease outbreaks), when public health perspective prevails over an individual-centred approach [ [84](#B84-vaccines-09-00113)]. In public health, the principle of justice means ensuring subjects equal access to preventive measures and, additionally, equal contribution to control of communicable diseases (i.e., by vaccination) [ [85](#B85-vaccines-09-00113), [86](#B86-vaccines-09-00113), [87](#B87-vaccines-09-00113)]. Giving up one's own interests to serve the common good is the idea of solidarity, which cannot be considered as a synonym or alternative to the rights-based concept of justice, but as a necessary complement to it [ [88](#B88-vaccines-09-00113)]. Features of solidarity are reciprocity and commitment to action, which brings also responsibilities to the participants [ [89](#B89-vaccines-09-00113)]. Although vaccine allocation is an important issue, especially in the times of a pandemic, we will in this section focus on just contribution to herd immunity. 5.1. Need to Define Herd Immunity as a Common Good [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00113), [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00113)]. Since control of infectious diseases is a public interest, herd immunity should be recognised as a common good [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00113), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00113)]. On the one hand, it means a form of solidarity with vulnerable members of our society; it helps to protect those, who are too young or too old to be vaccinated, unable to benefit from vaccination or have medical contraindications [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00113), [90](#B90-vaccines-09-00113)]. On the other hand, it allows so called \"free riders\" to enjoy benefits of herd immunity without bearing any costs of vaccination [ [90](#B90-vaccines-09-00113)]. Distinctive for public goods is also their failure in ordinary marketing; therefore, they need to be maintained by external forces [ [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00113)]. In our case, regulation of herd immunity could mean a mandatory vaccination policy. In addition, some similar common goods could even be recognised as constitutional rights (e.g., right to access to drinking water in Slovenia), which might even be a model for re-thinking herd immunity [ [91](#B91-vaccines-09-00113)]. 5.2. Ethical Justification of Obligatory Medical Procedure [90](#B90-vaccines-09-00113)]. Because education about risks and benefits is of limited value when herd immunity is achieved, it turned out in recent years that outbreaks of diseases (e.g., measles) can happen again in the countries with voluntary vaccination and not a sufficient degree of herd immunity [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00113), [90](#B90-vaccines-09-00113), [92](#B92-vaccines-09-00113)]. To prevent outbreaks and protect also vulnerable members of society, obligatory vaccination is sometimes justified [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00113), [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00113), [87](#B87-vaccines-09-00113), [93](#B93-vaccines-09-00113), [94](#B94-vaccines-09-00113), [95](#B95-vaccines-09-00113)]. Gostin proposed conditions for ethical justification of obligatory medical procedure, which are as follows: Inefficient measure on a voluntary basis, absence of a less coercive alternative, unambiguous scientific grounds and presence of risk to the members of society, which they are unaware of [ [96](#B96-vaccines-09-00113)]. He claims that restricting non-medical exemptions from vaccination is consistent with freedom of religion and conscience, because this policy does not target a particular community, but is applied equally throughout the society [ [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00113)]. Similarly, Giubilini argues that individuals have a moral obligation to be vaccinated, although contribution of a single individual to the realisation of herd immunity is insignificant. When individuals do not fulfil their duty, coercive vaccination policies are justified. They should be implemented gradually by the principle of least restrictive alternative [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00113), [78](#B78-vaccines-09-00113)]. Flanigan also claims that compulsory vaccination is justified, because vaccine refusal can harm innocent people that are susceptible to certain diseases. He provides an analogy of vaccine refusal to randomly firing a gun [ [93](#B93-vaccines-09-00113)]. On the other hand, some authors claim that solidarity should be a goal, not conformity. Parents should have a sense of moral responsibility, which is possible only if they are free to decide [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00113)]. Coercive measures can have even an adverse effect, especially in the long term [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00113), [82](#B82-vaccines-09-00113)]. However, a French survey showed that implementation of mandatory vaccination in 2018 and simultaneous promotion strategies had a positive impact on the mothers' opinions regarding vaccination [ [97](#B97-vaccines-09-00113)]. To achieve adequate levels of responsibility, regardless of vaccination policy, a trustful dialogue between healthcare providers and parents should be established, as well as public deliberation to foster a sense of the community benefit of vaccination and to enable parents to participate as citizens [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00113), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00113), [82](#B82-vaccines-09-00113)]. 5.3. State's Responsibility and Policies [87](#B87-vaccines-09-00113)]. This fact results in some similar implications for both maintaining traffic safety to reduce the injury rates (and thus fatalities) and herd immunity to reduce the rate of morbidity (and thus mortality) from infectious diseases; in both cases, behaviour of any individual potentially influences the health status of another individual within the population [ [98](#B98-vaccines-09-00113)]. However, we acknowledge that this analogy is not ideal, because unlike measures for traffic safety (some of which might be unpleasant or restrict us physically), vaccination is an invasive procedure (though the risks are only minimal). Therefore, parents have the right and duty to evaluate possible burdens and ask for reassurance. [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00113), [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00113)]. Though states are responsible to establish and maintain herd immunity, coercive measures should be kept to a minimal sufficient level [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00113), [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00113), [90](#B90-vaccines-09-00113)]. Strategies to achieve herd immunity include positive measures that make vaccination more favourable (e.g., education or family tax benefit) and negative measures (e.g., financial fines or prohibition of entering a kindergarten or a school) [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00113), [57](#B57-vaccines-09-00113), [92](#B92-vaccines-09-00113)]. The state's responsibility for information disclosure and education about vaccination should be considered a crucial portion of its responsibility for maintaining herd immunity, regardless of implemented vaccination policy [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00113), [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00113)]. In 2014, the European Union Council adopted the conclusion on \"vaccinations as an effective tool in public health\", which encouraged several countries to implement compulsory laws as a response to spreading anti-vaccination movements, which have threatened herd immunity in recent years [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00113), [99](#B99-vaccines-09-00113)]. A survey from 2020 evaluated mandatory vaccination policies in Europe, showing that they resulted in higher vaccination coverage and lower measles incidence [ [63](#B63-vaccines-09-00113)]. In the United States, the school attendance is universally conditioned on compliance with a schedule of vaccinations [ [100](#B100-vaccines-09-00113)]. However, compulsory policies should be considered as temporary rather than absolute, and constant reflection about their necessity and long-term effect is important [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00113), [90](#B90-vaccines-09-00113)]. A government should also take responsibility for a minority of individuals affected negatively by vaccination, especially of new, less tested vaccines [ [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00113)]. When a causal link is proved, an economic or other compensation should be provided [ [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00113)]. Responsibility of governing bodies towards control of infectious diseases should not be limited to a national level but extended to a global level. In providing measures (e.g., vaccination), the burden of the disease should take precedence over economic benefit. This requests development of vaccines for diseases, which do not necessarily represent significant burden in developed countries but are of major concern in developing parts of the world (e.g., Malaria, Tuberculosis, Ebola, AIDS) [ [101](#B101-vaccines-09-00113)]. 6. The Four Principles Practical Application: Two Clinical Vignettes [102](#B102-vaccines-09-00113)]. However, they have an important role as a tool to split complex ethical dilemmas into smaller, more comprehensive elements [ [102](#B102-vaccines-09-00113)]. Better understanding of relevant aspects of a particular case might guide decisions and also help to achieve a reasonable degree of moral justification for an individual [ [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00113)]. In this section, we provide two practical examples (case vignettes) on how the four principles can help both practitioner and patient to better reflect on the ethical dilemmas at stake, and to reach a sounder ethical decision in the context of vaccination in childhood. 6.1. Clinical Vignette #1 [103](#B103-vaccines-09-00113), [104](#B104-vaccines-09-00113)]. However, public health strategies with systematic provision of information about vaccination (i.e., on maternity wards; special leaflets) are an important complement to it, especially due to time limitations in the office [ [105](#B105-vaccines-09-00113)]. [75](#B75-vaccines-09-00113)]). Public health benefit should also be implied, especially since measles require a high level of herd immunity, which also needs to be appropriately communicated to the family. 6.2. Clinical Vignette #2 [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00113), [106](#B106-vaccines-09-00113)]; provision of simple facts about vaccination or paternalistic approach may backfire and make parents even more hesitant [ [107](#B107-vaccines-09-00113)]. One efficient strategy is motivational interviewing, which aims to inform parents about vaccinations, according to their specific needs and their individual level of knowledge, with respectful acceptance of their beliefs [ [107](#B107-vaccines-09-00113)]. 7. Discussion [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00113)]. In the ethics of vaccination, there are two major conflicts: One is between respect for autonomy and best interest of an individual (autonomy vs. beneficence/nonmaleficence), the other is between respect for autonomy and public good (autonomy vs. justice) [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00113)]. Because every dilemma by which physicians are confronted when parents refuse to vaccinate their children is context-specific and unique, we suggest a possible and simplified approach using the four principles. [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00113)]. When in doubt whether a certain condition is a possible contraindication, a risk:benefit assessment by an expert is indicated [ [76](#B76-vaccines-09-00113)]. Summaries of vaccine product characteristics and guidelines are useful in decision-making [ [76](#B76-vaccines-09-00113)]. [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00113)]. It is also needed to recognize the \"controlling influence\" of other people's opinions, conspiracy theories or anti-vaccination movements, which limits parents' autonomy [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00113)]. Many \"dilemmas\" can be solved through better communication and a systematic approach to vaccine education at all levels. [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00113)]. Voluntary compliance with vaccination requirements is the most desirable, but when the moral duty of individuals to contribute to the common good is not fulfilled and herd immunity is endangered, \"negative\" vaccination policies (i.e., laws and penalties, vaccination mandates for nursery or school entrance etc.) are justified in order to protect vulnerable subjects [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00113), [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00113)]. [60](#B60-vaccines-09-00113), [108](#B108-vaccines-09-00113)]. In [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00113-f001), a curve which represents the relation between parents' autonomy and benefit:risk ratio (or social justice) can be moved upwards in case of good society immunisation levels, which could allow non-medical exemptions. The principle of ethical equilibrium requests constant deliberation of risk for outbreaks and the need for mandatory vaccination policies. 8. Conclusions [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00113-t001).
