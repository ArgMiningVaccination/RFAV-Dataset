Keeping that energy within us flowing freely and evenly is where energy healing comes in, be it; Reiki, reflexology, acupuncture, acupressure, cranial osteopathy and many more energy modalities. The main focus of energy healing is to bring balance to the body resulting in Homeostasis, which in turn enables natural healing to begin, both in mind and body. We have 7 main energy centres otherwise known as chakras, and when one or more of those is out of balance, that's when potential \"dis-ease\" can set in which manifests in many ways from physical, to mental and emotional problems. Energy healing brings harmony and peace to the mind and body. From her South West London and Hampshire Practices, Georgiana treats her clients in dedicated Treatment Rooms providing a tranquil environment, her uniquely warm and down to earth manner ensures a relaxed and personal atmosphere. As a highly experienced Energy and Spiritual Healer, Georgiana provides a combined approach to acutely focus healing treatments. Your Reiki Healing treatment will consist of varying numbers of hand positions starting at the head and ending at the feet. The Reiki immediately connects with you without any ceremonies or intentions on my part. The energy has a high intelligence and will go where you need it. Quantum Touch Healing is a technique that employs natural healing working with the Life Force Energy of the body to help stimulate a person's wellness. Quantum Touch teaches us how to focus, amplify, and direct the energy, providing astonishingly beneficial results. Each of the Vogel quartz crystals has been cut to a precise and specific frequency which is then brought in to line above one of the seven human energy centres, also known as Chakras. The coloured lights, each of which have been chosen to match the specific vibrational frequency of each Chakra, radiates colour, light and energy through the crystals to each respective energy centre. The crystal beds lights glow in particular rhythms that help to cleanse, balance and align your natural energies. Reconnective Healing is a return to an optimal state of balance. It is the result of interacting with the fully comprehensive Reconnective & Spiritual Healing spectrum of frequencies that consists of energy, light and information. It's first element is ENERGY. Energy is everything we are made up of organically, our very essence and our actual physical body.

She has been the trigger in restoring my mind and body through her channelling of energy, giving me a great sense of peace, restoring my life force. Again I can face the world. Thank you. I tried Reiki because I have trouble sleeping and calming my mind down. I found to my astonishment that it released quite a bit of stress and really calmed me down, thereby giving me a good night's sleep. When I visit Georgiana she explained the treatment would help clear any negative energy or negative thoughts one might have and can help heal emotional pain too. This worked for me and my stress levels have significantly reduced with regular sessions. "}
