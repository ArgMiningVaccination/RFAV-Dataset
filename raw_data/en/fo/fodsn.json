Also known as cervix cancer, it is like any other form of [cancer](https://www.narayanahealth.org/cancer/) and is primarily caused due to the uncontrolled growth of anomaly cells in a particular area. The name of a particular type of cancer is often derived from the area where the cells are starting to proliferate. What is Cervix? A Brief Idea About Cervical Cancer The cervix is an important part of the female reproductive system and is located in the lowermost part of the uterus of the female anatomy. [Cervical Cancer](https://www.narayanahealth.org/cervical-cancer/) is a type of cancer affecting females when the cells in the cervix start to grow and regenerate at an uncontrollable rate while simultaneously affecting the surrounding tissues and organs. The growth rate of cervical cancer is very slow, leaving ample time for the patients to diagnose the condition and seek proper treatment of the same. However, if left unchecked, it might lead to a more complex condition known as metastasis indicating that the cancer is spreading to the other parts of the body affecting other major organs like lungs, urinary bladder, liver, rectum, and vagina. Primary Causes of Cervical Cancer Many causes lead to cervicitis or cervical cancer. One of the most diagnosed causes of cervicitis is the inflammation that is caused due to infections transmitted during sexual activity. A viral infection caused due to sexual contact at an early age, frequent usage of birth control pills, oral contraceptives, and having multiple sexual partners may all lead to cervical cancer, mostly due to infection from the resultant STDs. Some of the common Sexually Transmitted Diseases or STDs that can lead to Cervical Cancer: - Chlamydia - Genital herpes - Trichomoniasis - Gonorrhea - Mycoplasma & ureaplasma However, not all cervicitis cases are the resultant of STDs or Sexually Transmitted Diseases. The Other Causes of Cervical Cancer Are: - Cervicitis can be caused due to irritation or injuries due to tampon usage, pessaries, or female birth control devices like diaphragms. - A special type of bacterial imbalance in the vagina, where the healthy and normal bacteria is overwhelmed by unhealthy, harmful bacteria causing an abnormal condition known as bacterial vaginosis. - A special type of hormonal imbalance is caused due to low estrogen and high progesterone levels that may create interference in the body's ability to maintain healthy cervical tissue. - You can also get cervical pain from allergies from chemicals in douches, spermicides, or from the latex rubber in condoms. - Cervical pain or cervicitis may also occur from cancer treatment procedures like [radiation therapy](https://www.narayanahealth.org/specialities/radiation-oncology)causing changes to the cervix consistent with cervicitis. Other anomalies that lead to cervical cancer include genetic anomalies in the cervical tissues. This leads to the uncontrolled formation of cell clusters that can lead to further mutations in the DNA changes forming a cancerous tissue. The cancerous condition in the cervix leads to the metastasizing of this tissue to other parts and organs of the body leading to further complications. One of the primary infectious causes leading to cervical cancer is the HPV or [Human Papillomavirus](https://www.narayanahealth.org/blog/human-papillomavirus-hpv-causes-symptoms-treatment-options/) that causes infection near the cervix. Human Papillomavirus is a virus that is generally transmitted through unprotected sexual contact. It can cause abnormal skin disorders like skin warts and genital warts. Most of the time, the virus is tackled by the body's immunity and stops being harmful. However, patients with weak immunity may have the virus in the body, eventually leading to cervical cancer. Types of Cervical Cancer Adenocarcinoma Adenocarcinoma or Cervical adenocarcinoma is the condition where cancer cells build up in the glandular cells lining up the upper portion of the cervix. It is responsible for almost 20% of all cervical cancer cases. Squamous Cell Carcinoma This condition constitutes almost 80% of all cervical cancer cases. This is a condition where thin, flat cancerous cells develop at the bottom of the cervix. Conclusion Cancer is a very serious issue in today's world and almost all types of cancer require proper medical help for the patient to have the best chances at survival. The global cancer rate is on the rise where more and more patients are getting affected by some form of cancer. Cervical cancer is a common type of cancer affecting females and should be diagnosed and addressed at the earliest to ensure optimum prevention and quick remedy. One of the major causes of cervical cancer is uncontrolled sexual practices. Therefore, it is advised that you practice safe and protected sex to lower your chances of being affected by this ailment. If you suspect having cervical cancer, then immediately seek proper medical help and consultation to ensure your healthy well being.
