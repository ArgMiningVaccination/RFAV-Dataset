In recent years a growing number of contemporary academics have published extensive criticism on anthroposophy, written from the perspective of \"established\" science and based upon profound knowledge of Rudolf Steiner's works. Helmut Zander has produced a comprehensive, two-volume analysis of Anthroposophy in Germany. For decades now, Heiner Ullrich, as an education theorist, has been carrying on a critical discussion of Waldorf education and its anthroposophical underpinnings. In autumn of this year (2011) appeared Hartmut Traub's thousand-page treatise on the basic philosophical writings of Rudolf Steiner. -What is important here is that a serious dialogue with anthroposophy has been opened up by representatives of modern academia. So far such a discussion has only been pursued on a small scale by representatives of anthroposophy. Rose Research on Steiner Education 2010 Humanist 2000 \"Anthroposophy and Ecofascism\" has sparked a debate within Scandinavian humanist circles, with some authors like Peter Normann Waage lining up to defend anthroposophy as a harmless variant of humanism. 1 While we are encouraged by this long overdue debate, we are troubled by the degree of historical naivet\u00e9 it has revealed. Waage's perspective seems to represent a view that is fairly widespread among educated and well-intentioned people. We hope that we can contribute to a more accurate view of the political implications of anthroposophy by correcting several of the misconceptions exemplified by Waage's reply. Approaching Religion The aim of this article is to examine how Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophical ideas were reflected and put into practice in the lives of the Finnish couple Olly (Olga) Donner (1881-1956, ne\u00e9 encountered anthroposophy in 1913 and subsequently embraced it as the guiding principle of their lives. Through a close examination of these two people we aim to shed light on how a new worldview like anthroposophy, which was gaining followers in early twentieth-century Finland, was also a manifestation of wider changes in religious culture in Europe. Our perspective could be described as biographical in the sense that it has been characterised by Simone L\u00e4ssig (2008: 11) who writes that 'the reconstruction of individual life courses helps to discover more about the context - for example, about daily rituals, pious practices, or kinship relationship'. Thus, the biographical perspective serves as a tool for grasping how something as deeply personal as an anthroposophical worldview was understood and practiced, not only by Olly and Uno Donner, but also by a larger group of people who in the early twentieth century were looking for new ways to make sense of the surrounding world. Journal of Art Historiography 19 2018 It is a topos that the manifold heterodox religious movements that have been spreading throughout Europe in the late 19th century paved the way for the abandonment of representational painting by virtue of providing a reconsideration of traditional thought systems as well as a reorientation of established values. The leading proponents of these subversive ideas often sought to direct and regulate artistic production through various ways. In this context, Rudolf Steiner's dynamic interaction with young artists who came to attend his lectures offers an interesting paradigm that stands in sharp contrast to other practices followed by more traditional scholarly simulated lectures. After 1907, by weaving together esoteric Christianity with Goethe's colour theory and projecting them into an art historical narrative, Steiner denounced the mainstream theosophical doctrine, spread by Annie Besant, and was ready to express contemporary preoccupations regarding the importance of colour in the reinvention of artistic practice. Both a transmitter of ideas and an eclectic recipient of contemporary artistic discourses, Steiner urged young artists to engage with specific art-theory discourses and interfered in the artistic production by commissioning art works or by providing instructions for them. Theosophical Appropriations: Esotericism, Kabbalah, and the Transformation of Traditions, edited by Julie Chajes and Boaz Huss 2016 Theosophical Appropriations Esotericism, Kabbalah and the Transformation of Traditions Editors: Julie Chajes, Boaz Huss The thirteen chapters of this volume examine intersections between theosophical thought and areas as diverse as the arts, literature, scholarship, politics, and, especially, modern interpretations of Judaism and kabbalah. Each chapter offers a case study in theosophical appropriations of a different type and in different context. The chapters join together to reveal congruencies between theosophical ideas and a wide range of contemporaneous intellectual, cultural, religious, and political currents. They demonstrate the far-reaching influence of the theosophical movement worldwide from the late-nineteenth century to the present day.

This theoretical paper explores the possibilities of using illuminative practitioner research in steiner/Waldorf pedagogy. Waldorf schools' claim to autonomy rests on the assumption that the school leadership bases its accountability for the quality of the education on evaluation, reflective practices and systematic inquiry. In particular, the pedagogy should be based on ongoing reflection in and on practice using steiner's foundational theory. There is some evidence that this activity is relatively weak in many schools due to the fact that many teachers feel inadequately prepared for conducting reliable practitioner research using Waldorf theory. Furthermore, academic research into Waldorf pedagogy generally does not use Waldorf theory, which it considers unscientific. It is argued that research in education is most coherent and valid when the epistemology, theoretical perspective and methods align within the research design. That means teachers need a research method is needed that aligns with an anthroposophical perspective. It is suggested here that illuminative practitioner research using a Gadamerian or human scientific (van Manen) hermeneutic and phenomenological approach, can be used with Waldorf theoretical perspectives and contemplative methods to provide a scientifically valid way of researching Waldorf practice. This would need to be introduced in initial Waldorf teacher education and supported by researchers at a regional level.
