Trial registration ISRCTN Registry no.ISRCTN11674947 Introduction Asian nations and other developing countries worldwide currently experiencing population ageing atafaster rate than that experienced byNorth America and Western Europe inthepre- vious century [1].Falls inolder persons will, therefore, inevitably pose alarge and growing burden tohealthcare services inthese countries. Falls arecommon among older adults and are associated with adverse physical consequences including hipfractures, other major fractures and intracranial bleeding [2,3].Functional dependency and psychological consequences asso- ciated with falls such asdepression and pathological fear-of-falling have also been observed after anindex fall[4].Inaddition, oneinfour older people who present toemergency services following afallwere found tobenolonger alive after oneyear [5]. Numerous intervention studies have been conducted forprimary and secondary prevention offalls inolder been shown tobebeneficial asasecondary prevention strategy toreduce frequency offalls, available evidence have been drawn from predominantly Caucasian popula- tions, with fewfalls studies conducted inAsia todate [7].Arecent no published randomized controlled studies using multifactorial interventions forsecondary falls prevention inSouth-East Asia, though ahandful ethnic community also contributes tounique cultural differences which may influence fallrisk factors [10]. The effect ofmulticomponent interventions isalso considered variable, with many negative studies inexistence despite pooled results suggesting overall benefit [11\u00b114]. Therefore, avail- able evidence ontheefficacy ofmultifactorial interventions remains conflicting, and may be dependent upon thecombination ofthecomponent interventions aswell multi-ethnic, middle-income nation inSouth-East ledtrial asimple randomization with a1:1allocation ratio. to2014, thelastparticipant's visit occurring sample sizes wasobtained. The study wasapproved bythe local institutional review board, University ofMalaya Medical Ethics Committee (ethics num- ber925.4), and written informed consent wasobtained from allparticipants. Community-dwel ling individuals aged were recruited from depart- ment, medical outpatients and primary care clinic atateaching hospital inKuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The exclusion criteria were: clinically-diagnosed dementia, major psychiatric ill- nesses and participants were randomized toindividu- ally-tailored multifactorial intervention treatment, toallparticipants. Randomization wasperformed using acomputer generated random number sequence, and treatment allocation wasconcealed using sealed-opaque envelopes and stored inasecure location. Enrolment and assessments were conducted bytrained research assistants. Fallrecurrence were monitored through monthly falldiaries. Participants were re- assessed after 12months atahospital visit. Baseline assessment Allinformation wascollected instrument. Baseline infor- mation onage, sex,ethnicity, social circumstances, medical history and medications associated injury, medical attention received and presence ofany associated symptoms were also obtained. Following that, allparticipants were assessed using standardized assessment tools toidentify potential risk factors forfalls: gaitand balance, visual impairment, falls riskmedications, cardiovascular risk, fear-of-falling and depression. Our research assistants who have received training intheadministration ofall assessment items. Physical performance assessment. Gait and balance were assessed with theTimed-Up and Gotest(TUG) and functional reach (FR) [17, the time taken byparticipants torisefrom achair with armrests, walk forward three metres at their usual pace, turn around and return tothechair. Functional reach wasmeasured byasking theparticipants tostand onawall with their leftarm outstretched, and tolean forwards asfaraspossible without losing their balance.

Visual acuity wasassessed using theSnellen chart. Visual acuity was then converted toLogMAR values forsubsequent analysis. Contrast sensitivity wasassessed bilaterally using thePelli-Robson chart atone-metre distance and stereopsis assessed with the Frisby Near Stereoacuity test. The Allparticipants were assessed with a12-lead electrocardio- gram (ECG), and lying and standing oscillometric blood pressure, which wasmeasured first in thesupine position, 3minutes beat-to-beat used torecord blood pressure changes from thesupine toerect posture throughout (Task Force1 Monitor, CNSystems, Austria). blood instrument wastranslated into theMalay language (the national language ofMalaysia) and validated, and previously validated versions inChinese and English were also validated prior tobeing administered toourparticipants. short FES-I score of11ormore outofamaximum score of28wasconsidered fear-of-falling [22]. Depression, anxiety and stress were determined using the21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) [23]. This tool hadpreviously been validated and stress were 7,6and 10respectively [24]. Individuals with severe and extremely severe anxiety and depression were referred forpsychological follow-up forethical multifactorial intervention. Amodified Otago exercise programme, visual intervention, home environmental modification, medication review and cardiovascular intervention were pro- vided according totheoutcome oftheir baseline assessments based onpredefined criteria. All participants received falls education and medication review. The appropriate interventions were assigned following theassessment byageriatrician. Modified Otago exercise programme.

Each participant wasgiven atraining pack which included pictorial instructions fortheir exercises, atraining diary which they were required tocomplete and apair of500g ankle weights.

Detailed ophthalmic examinations were carried outand interventions were prescribed accordingly. These included spectacle prescriptions forsignificant refractive errors, lubricants forsymptomatic dryeyes, initiation ofglaucoma medications and early cataract surgery [28]. Home environment modification. Individuals with atleast oneindoor fallwhich was non-syncopal innature and who agreed were referred forhome hazards assessment. This wasperformed byatrained occupational therapist using theHome Falls and Accidents Screening Tool (HOME FAST) [29]. The HOMEFAST is a25-item checklist used tosystematically report potential hazards inand around thehome. Recommendations were made bytheoccupational therapist based onthehazards identified. Tofacilitate immediate implementation, aids and equipment were provided and installed upon completion oftheenvironmental assessment where feasible. The modifications provided focused onimproving movement and night time visibility such asadhesive glow tapes atcor- ners, light switches and steps ofstaircases. Medication review. Allparticipants asked tobring both their medication tion listand alltheir medications totheinitial appointment. The information wascorrobo- rated with hospital electronic prescribing records and additional confirmation wasobtained through follow-up telephone calls toparticipants ifnecessary. This byatrained medical practitioner and reviewed byatrained geriatrician. Falls risk increasing drugs were identified and discontinued whenever possible [30]. Iftheparticipant's medical condition didnotallow fordrug discontinuation, dose-reduction orreplacement with more selective bytheattending geriatrician based onclinical judgement using theabove strategy. Cardiovascular interventions. The initial cardiovascular assessments were reviewed alongside thefalls history bythegeriatrician. Individuals with anabnormal 12-lead ECG were further investigated with echocardiography and ambulatory ECG monitoring. Individuals with ahistory noevidence ofcardiac then assessed with carotid sinus massage and tilt-table testing using previously published protocols [31, 32]. Permanent cardiac pacemakers were implanted forthose with evidence ofbradyarrhythmia onambulatory monitoring or12-lead ECG. Those with evidence ofischaemia were referred toacardiologist forfurther assessment. Individuals with symptomatic orlarge postural blood pressure changes were given conservative advice and hadpotential culprit medications discontinued asdescribed 5/16Falls Falls education wasprovided using printed material explaining common riskfactors and how toavoid future falls, alongside verbal advice asperindividual established risks. Attending family members were also counselled with regards tofalls risks and preven- tion where possible. Otherwise theparticipants were encouraged toread through theprinted materials with their spouses and adult children. The printed information were sent outbypost toparticipants with their second setoffalls diaries.

The first fall event wasconsidered outcome. `Rate of tofirst falland mortality wasalso compared between groups assecondary outcomes. Falls were recorded prospectively using monthly falldiaries with daily entries. These diaries were available inthree languages (English, Malay and Mandarin) and used pictorial represen- tations. Participants and attending family caregivers were instructed onhow tocomplete these diaries attheend oftheir baseline assessment visit and providing with their first month's falls diary. Monthly diaries were sent outbypost with self-addressed stamped envelopes over the subsequent 11months. Diary returns were encouraged with reminder telephone calls topartic- ipants who didnotreturn their diaries three months received dia- riesbutdidnotreturn them bypost asnofalls' after through atelephone call.

Falls outcomes Atotal of506fallevents were documented. Fig2illustrates thecumulative falls and (70.5%) participants reported atleast one fallinthe12-month follow-up period. Nosignificant differences were found infallrecurrence and mortality between groups (Table 3). The estimated mean number offalls perperson was1.9(\u00b12.1 SD). The intervention group (274 falls, 2.0falls perperson,\u00b12.3 SD) compared tothecontrol group (232 falls, 1.8falls perperson,\u00b11.7 SD). However, there wasnosignificant difference in therate offalls intervention and control groups (RR =1.16; to1.58). The estimated mean time tofirst fallwas249.2 days.

Malaysia isconsidered developing lowed byChinese and Indians, with individual groups preserving their ancestral cultures and lifestyles [36]. Astudy involving complex interventions forolder adults inthissetting isthere- fore likely toexpose important issues surrounding theAsian culture and health beliefs that may influence thedelivery ofsuch interventions, which would However, mortality rate ofoursample population wasslightly higher than that reported inprevious studies, with [38]. This suggests that theincluded sample waspotentially more frail with similar characteristics to those who wearelikely totreat inourclinics [39]. This hadevaluated interventions among populations which arenotreflective ofreal-world conditions [41]. Hence, pragmatic designs and minimal exclusions, such asthat reported inthepresent study, should rate of70% does reflect that reported byother studies, which reported a similar recurrence rate among at-risk benefits rather than fall [43].

Itcould bepossible that twoormore interventions may lead tomore change than the older person iscomfortable with accepting [15]. Adherence issues were observed inmany multifactorial intervention studies including the MyFAIT study [15, 46,47]. The delivery ofmultifactorial interventions involves numerous challenges that may beprimarily attributed toboth participant and staff adherence.

Therefore, themeasurement offalloutcomes alone may notnecessarily reveal anysignificant difference perhaps duetothe differences infallavoidance strategies and potentially higher levels ofsupervision afforded through extended family households and larger family sizes. Future analyses should consider evaluating therelative contribution ofeach component intervention aswell asexplore more appropriate outcome forfalls torial interventions toconventional treatment assecondary falls prevention. Future studies should consider evaluating ingreater detail, cultural differences inbehaviour and outcomes following fallevents, aswell asidentify culturally appropriate solutions forthe fallers inlower and middle-income countries.
