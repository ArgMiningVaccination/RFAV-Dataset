Background: Complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is widely used among patients with cancer.This usage may have potentially harmful effects, especiallywhen combined with anticancer drugs. However, somecomplementary methods may benefit patients. This reviewinvestigated the prevalence of CAM use among patients withcancer in Scandinavia and secondly studied the educationallevels of CAM users compared to non-users. Materials andMethods: A systematic search of the PubMed library wascarried out to locate articles published between January2000 and October 2015 that investigated prevalence of CAMuse among Scandinavian patients with cancer. Results:Twenty-two articles were found, of which nine were includedin the review. The prevalence of CAM use was 7.9% to 53%,with an average of 36.0% across all studies. Conclusion:Use of CAM is widespread among patients with cancer.Knowledge about CAM should be disseminated to bothpatients and staff in order to optimise discussions aboutCAM in clinical practice. The role of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has continuously increased in Swedish society, with anincreasing number of shops selling alternative andcomplementary remedies (1). Despite this fact, the medicalcommunity has not recognised this as an important issueand CAM is not a topic that is discussed with patientsattending cancer clinics in northern Europe (and especially Sweden) (2, 3). The explanation for this may bemultifactorial, with both a perceived lack of interest fromattending healthcare professionals, as well as unease frompatients in telling their healthcare professional about theCAM that they are taking (4). In the present review article,we compiled a comprehensive list of available studiesinvestigating the usage of CAM in Scandinavian patientswith cancer with the aim of determining the percentage ofsuch patients that regularly use CAM. What is CAM? According to the United States National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine(NCCAM), CAM is defined as healthcare outsideconventional proven medicine. There is however a differencebetween 'complementary' and 'alternative' medicine. Theterm 'complementary' is used when patients use non-mainstream practice as a complement to conventionalmedicine. The term 'alternative medicine', on the other hand,is used when non-mainstream healthcare practice is usedinstead of proven mainstream therapies. When patients withcancer choose alternative medicine instead of conventionaltherapy, they risk delaying primary treatment. Consequently,potentially curable early stages of cancer may progress andbecome fatal (5). In recent years, the term CAM has been challenged and numerous studies suggest that it should be changed. In areview article by Cassielth et al. , the following reason was cited: \"This controversial term should be changed, since thewords 'complementary' and 'alternative' have differentmeanings and should not be connected by 'and' \" (5, 6).Alternatively, when the use of conventional cancer therapycombined with complementary methods aims to reducesymptoms, the term 'integrative oncology' is more adequate.The use of non-proven healthcare, regardless of beingcomplementary or alternative, is divided into several 3243This article is freely accessible online.

The first subcategory is that of natural products, such as herbs, vitamins, probiotics etc., that are often sold as healthy dietary supplements, whereas some ofthese supplements may in fact be harmful (7). 'Miracle cures'such as amygdalin and caesium chloride have not onlyshown lack of efficiency in clinical studies, they may alsocause cyanide toxicity and potentially lethal cardiacarrhythmia (5). The second subcategory is that of mind and body practices, such as mind-body therapies, acupuncture andmanipulative and body-based practices. Mind-body therapies such as meditation, relaxation, hypnotherapy, yoga, tai chi, music therapy and qigong haveshown beneficial effects on anxiety reduction, improvementof quality of life and sleep. Acupuncture has been evaluated as a safe method of improving symptoms such as pain, chemotherapy-inducednausea, and radiation-induced xerostomia, and its inclusionin multimodal management plans of patients with cancer hasbeen suggested (5). Manipulative and body-based practices such as Swedish massage, shiatsu, tui na, reflexology, Thai massage,Ayurvedic massage, lymphatic drainage and myofascialrelease have shown beneficial effects on pain and anxiety,however, these results were based on clinical trials with poorresearch methodology (5). Other complementary health approaches that do not fit into the subcategories listed above include traditionalhealers, homeopathy, naturopathy etc.(8). Are CAM therapies harmless? Not all patients are aware that the use of non-proven therapies is not harmless. There areseveral potentially harmful natural products that may interactwith anticancer drugs. For example, Sparreboom et al. described methysticum all had the potential to modulate the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes such ascytochrome p450 and the drug transporter P-glycoprotein, hence they can potentially have pharmacokinetic interactionswith anticancer drugs (7). Furthermore, Rakovitch et al. conducted a study including 251 patients with breast cancer,of whom 43% used CAM. The authors showed that thepatients that used CAM had a significantly higher risk ofcancer recurrence and death than non-users (9). It has alsobeen suggested that fewer than half of all CAM users consulttheir healthcare professionals about their CAM use (3). Who uses CAM and why? Several studies have indicated that the typical CAM-users are younger, highly educated femaleindividuals (10-12). CAM users have a higher income andoverall higher social status than non-users (13). More often,patients with a poorer quality of life including symptom progression use CAM (14, 15). Studies in the last decadehave shown that patients who use CAM have higher levels ofanxiety, pain, depression, dissatisfaction with conventionalcare and a lower quality of life than non-users (16, 17). However, involvement in medical decision-making of conventional medicine does not seem to affect the decisionto use CAM (18). Oncology health professionals may alsouse CAM. Kolstad et al. showed in a national multicentre survey from Norwegian health professionals that about 20%of oncologists and 50% of nurses used CAM of some sort(19). Patients using CAM do not necessarily mistrust conventional drugs. The principles of anthroposophicmedicine are that, frequently, conventional medicine is notenough to reach 'true healing'. In order to achieve this, thepatients must use complementary methods, such as bodilypractices or a variety of natural products (20). Patients, however, are not very keen to tell physicians about their use. Reasons for this nondisclosure wereinvestigated by Eisenberg et al. , and the majority of patients reported their reason for nondisclosure as \"It wasn't importantfor the physician to (60%). However, only 14% reported that they thoughtthe doctor would disapprove of or discourage their use ofCAM (4). Use of multiple CAM therapies. Several studies have highlighted that patients using CAM often use a variety ofseveral different CAM therapies at the same time (21, 22).This makes it difficult to evaluate both positive and adverseeffects of the diverse substances and practices. Aim of study. The aim was to characterize in a structural manner the available literature concerning CAM-use amongScandinavian cancer patients, which according to ourknowledge never has been done before. Materials and Methods Electronic database searches and article selection strategy. We searched for articles published from January 2000 until October2015 in international peer-reviewed journals through a systematicsearch of PubMed. The MeSH terms used were: complementaryalternative medicine AND patients with cancer AND survey ANDScandinavia. We excluded all studies not written in the Englishlanguage. We also excluded studies based on patients withoutcancer, as well as studies that did not investigate prevalence ofCAM use among their subjects. Data extraction. For each selected article, the following data were extracted: types of cancer among the subjects, number of subjectsincluded, gender, participation rate/response rate, use of CAM (%)among the subjects, median age, type of anthroposophic therapy,demography and educational levels among CAM users.ANTICANCER RESEARCH 36: 3243-3252 (2016) 3244Nilsson et al: Review of Complementary Alternative Medicine Use in Scandinavia (Review) 3245Table I.

Of these, three articles were excluded because they did notinclude patients with cancer, seven were excluded since theydid not investigate prevalence of CAM use among patientswith cancer, and three were excluded due to non-Englishlanguage. After the exclusions, a total of nine articlesfulfilled the selection criteria and were included in thereview; these articles included data generated from between92 and 2,920 patients. Two articles included only patientswith breast cancer, one article included patients with lungcancer alone and one included only patients with colorectalcancer. Two articles included patients with a variety ofcancer diagnoses and three articles did not specify what typeof cancer diagnosis the patients had. All included articles reported both use of CAM among the participants and the participation rate/response rate (Table II).Five articles reported education levels of the CAM users (TableIII). In total, five studies were conducted in Norway, two inSweden and two in Denmark. The use of CAM in the studiedpopulations ranged from 7.9% to 53%, with an average use of36.0% throughout all articles. Five out of nine articles reportedCAM use above 40%, whilst three articles reported CAM use of 21.7% or less. The participation rate ranged from 26.8% to78%. Five studies reported a participation rate of 65% or more,whilst only two articles had a participation rate of less than50% (26.8% and 31.5%, respectively). What percentage of patients with cancer use CAM continuously? In 2002, Risberg et al. investigated the relationship between the use of CAM by patients with cancerand their level of self-perceived mental distress. The authorsused a questionnaire-based longitudinal study design andincluded all patients under 75 years of age who had had theirfirst contact with the Department of Oncology, UniversityHospital of Tromso during the period 1990 to 1991 and whosurvived at least a 1-year follow-up. A total of 157 patientswith various cancer diagnoses were asked to answer questionsregarding their use of CAM and level of mental distress. Theparticipation rate was 65%. Of all patients that responded tothe first follow-up after 12 months, a total of 41% (64/157)reported regular use of CAM during follow-up. Educationallevels were only published as basic characteristics of allparticipants, and no information was reported on theeducational level of CAM users specifically (23).ANTICANCER RESEARCH 36: 3243-3252 (2016) 3246Table II.

Five regional cancer Centres in Norway gatheredinformation about CAM use among patients with cancerunder 75 years of age who were not bedridden. Theparticipants were asked to complete a survey about their useof CAM, quality of life and about various demographicfactors. There was an 8-year follow-up to investigate cancersurvival among these individuals. The participation rate was70%. A total of 515 patients with various cancer diagnoseswere included in the study. Of these, 112 patients (21.7%)used some kind of CAM: 61% used spiritual methods (faithhealing or healing by hand) and 39% used non-spiritualmethods only. Nearly half of the CAM users used two ormore methods in the same period. There was a slightlyhigher educational level of the CAM users compared withnon-users (higher education 45.9% versus 40.2% in the non- user group). However, a larger proportion of CAM users hada low level of educational (45.9% high level, 54.1% lowlevel). The definition of the different education levels wasnot stated (14). In 2012, Kristoffersen et al. investigated whether there was a difference in CAM use between patients with cancer,those with coronary heart disease (CHD) and the generalpopulation. The authors used data from the Tromso studyseries. The survey was conducted in 1994-1995 and a totalof 8,040 individuals were included (response rate=77.6%).Altogether 1,280 individuals did not complete the surveycorrectly and were excluded for that reason. Another 169 hadboth CHD and cancer, therefore they were excluded. A totalof 6,591 participants were included, of whom 331 hadcancer.

Educational levels were onlyreported as basic characteristics and were not specified forthe CAM-user group (24). In 2013, Pedersen et al. studied the relationship between religious faith and use of CAM in patients with breastcancer. A total of 4,917 Danish women treated surgically forearly-stage breast cancer were invited to answer aquestionnaire about their use of CAM and religiousconviction. Both natural products and mind-and-bodypractices were assessed. The first questionnaire was sent out3-4 months post primary surgery and the response rate was68%. A follow-up questionnaire was sent out 15-16 monthspost-surgery and of the remaining eligible recurrence-freewomen (n=3,128) 94% returned a valid questionnaireregarding questions about CAM use and religious faith. Ofthe remaining 2,920 women, 49.8% had used some kind ofCAM within the previous year (25). L\u00f6vgren et al. studied the association between perceptions of quality of life and use of CAM in patients with lungcancer. The authors sent out a questionnaire issuing thesequestions to all members of the Swedish National LungCancer Patient Organisation in 2007, including a total of 351patients. The response rate was only 26.8%. Of all patientswith lung cancer who returned the questionnaire, 53% usedCAM. Of note is that fewer than half of the CAM users hadtold the healthcare system about their use. By educationalmeasurements, 48% had earned a university/college degree,26% had reached high school and 18% did not have a highschool diploma (3). In 2014, Nissen et al. investigated the use of CAM in patients with colorectal cancer by survey assessment. A totalof 783 patients were identified through the Danish NationalPatient Registry and invited onto the study. Of these, 247(31.5%) participated. Nearly half (49.4%) of them had usedsome type of CAM in the previous month. Amongst theCAM users, there was a significant relationship betweeneducational level and the use of alternative treatment ornatural medicines/dietary supplements. Of those usingalternative treatment, 77% had a tertiary degree or higher,whilst 23% had completed primary and lower secondaryeducation only. Amongst users of natural medicines/dietarysupplements, 62.9% had a tertiary degree or higher, and37.1% had lower or upper secondary education only (26). To study the use of CAM in patients with breast cancer, Hietala et al. invited Swedish women who had been preoperatively assessed before undergoing first breast cancersurgery. In this assessment, they filled out a preoperativequestionnaire that included questions based on several areasof interest, including use of concomitant medications duringthe previous week. Follow-up was carried out for up to fiveyears postoperatively. Of all 1,700 patients from both Lund(n=1132) and Helsingborg (n=568), 855 patients were included in the study (50.3%). Information on CAM use wasavailable for 846 of these patients. Overall, 38.7% of thepatients reported having used CAM (naturalmedicines/dietary supplements) on at least one visit duringthe study. Educational levels were not specified (27). In 2010, Steinsbekk et al. investigated the use of CAM among those who had or had had cancer in the Norwegianpopulation. Data were used from the cross-sectional Nord-Tr\u00f6ndelag Health Study (HUNT 2 Study) that was conductedbetween 1995 and 1997 in Norway (39). A total of 2,409participants reported having either a history of cancer or acurrent cancer diagnosis. Questions on CAM use werecompleted by 1,406 (58.4%) of these individuals. In the study,CAM was defined as having visited one or more CAMpractitioners in the previous year. In total, 16.1% of the patientswith cancer were defined as CAM users. Of the CAM users,41.5% (n=88) had an educational level of compulsory school,36.8% (n=78) had completed middle school (secondary schoolincluding vocational education below university level) and21.7% (n=46) had a university degree (28). Engdal et al. studied the use of CAM among patients with cancer treated with chemotherapy for both palliative andcurative reasons. A total of 144 patients were invited toparticipate in the survey-based study at two outpatient clinicsin a rural area in Norway between 2006 and 2007. Onehundred and twelve patients fulfilled the questionnaires(response rate=78%). Of all patients with cancer treated withchemotherapy, 46% used some kind of herbal therapy eitherbefore or concomitant with conventional chemotherapy. Thirtyeight percent of all patients used some kind of herbal therapyconcomitant with chemotherapy, and no difference was seenbetween patients treated with curative (38%) or palliative(37%) intent ( p=0.916). By educational measurements, of all curatively treated patients using CAM; 30.8% had completedcompulsory school, 46.2% had completed middle school(optional upper secondary school) and 23.1% had a universitydegree. Of all patients treated with palliative intent; 17.2% hadcompleted compulsory school, 51.7% had completed middleschool and 31% had a university degree (29). Discussion The results of this study indicate that CAMs seem to be usedby a significant number of patients with cancer inScandinavian countries. This is noteworthy since staff fromconventional healthcare seldom know about the usage ofCAM (2, 3) and because of the potential negative side-effectsthat some natural products may cause (7, 9). An open andrespectful dialogue about CAM between patients andhealthcare providers has been suggested, which would to openup possibilities for equally sharing different views about CAMuse (30) to address this lack of cognizance about CAM use.ANTICANCER RESEARCH 36: 3243-3252 (2016) 3248Three studies differed substantially from the rest with far lower levels of CAM usage. The lowest report of CAM usagein this review was shown by Kristoffersen et al. in 2012 (7.9%). However, this study only investigated visits to a CAMprovider, which were not further specified. Thus, all patientsusing complementary methods such as diets or supplementarynatural products might have been excluded. The authors useda population-based design with a general invitation toparticipate. The reported participation rate was 77.6%;however, the subjects were eventually divided into subgroupsand the actual participation rate among patients with cancerwas not reported. Hence, the overall level of CAM use wasprobably greater than reflected in this study (24). The second lowest level of CAM use (16.1%) was reported by Steinsbekk et al. in 2010. The authors defined CAM users as those having visited a CAM provider in theprevious 12 months, thus excluding all other types of CAMuse. The participants were eligible if \"ever having cancer\".Thus patients who had visited a CAM provider while beingtreated for cancer more than one year earlier, but not sincethen, were excluded by definition from being CAM users.Hence, the overall use of CAM was probably greater thanreported in this study (28). The third lowest number was reported by Risberg et al. in 2003 (21.7%). The authors defined CAM users as those thatadmitted to using alternative methods to treat their cancer.However, as mentioned earlier, the primary purpose oftreatment for many CAM users is to ease symptom burdenand not to treat cancer itself. These patients will thus nothave been defined as CAM users and the true CAM use wasprobably greater than reported. Patients above 75 years ofage were also excluded, potentially reflecting incorrect levelsof true CAM use (23). Of the studies that reported fairly equal levels of CAM use, close to 50%, Pedersen et al. included most participants (n=2,920), with an acceptable participation rate (68%).Patients included were those who had used any type ofcomplementary medicine during cancer treatment, mostlikely reporting a good representation of CAM use amongpatients with breast cancer. Since the typical CAM user isfemale, however, this number might be higher than theaverage use among patients with cancer in general (13). The remaining studies included either had relatively low numbers of participants or low participation rates, makingthe results less valid. This systematic review focused on articles published in Scandinavian settings. No demographic trend was seen inprevalence of CAM use, since articles describing both urbanand rural populations reported similar results. For example, aNorwegian multicentre study (14), a study on populationsfrom northern Norway (24) and one from central Norway(28) reported the lowest prevalence rates along with theSwedish study from Lund and Helsingborg (27), which arequite large cities with high population densities. One reason might be that socioeconomic factors may predict the use ofCAM (10) rather than population density or urban/ruraldemographic areas. Since complementary medicine can be quite expensive, one might expect that higher socioeconomic status may beassociated with use of CAM. Patients with a highereducation level may also doubt the conventional system andbe more aware of CAM treatments (10). As this reviewshows, there were various levels of education amongst theCAM users in the different studies. Also, the definitions ofeducational levels vary among all studies, makingcomparisons between them less valid. Some studies,however, report a high educational level (3, 26), while othersreport intermediate or low educational levels amongst theCAM users (14, 28, 29). Hence, in this review, comparisonsbetween educational levels despite different definitionsthroughout the articles showed no trend towards either highor low educational levels amongst the CAM users. However, as also seen in previous studies (10-12), most of the reviewed articles reported a higher prevalence ofCAM use amongst female individuals compared to the malepopulation, even when excluding articles investigatingpatients with breast cancer. However, this difference issuggested to be reflected by a greater tendency to seekhealthcare in general, as women tend to seek all types ofhealthcare and suffer from chronic illnesses more often thanmen (31). The reasons for using CAM are probably multifactorial. While some patients use CAM due to true dissatisfaction orscepticism (16, 17) others may use it because they believe inanthroposophic medicine rather than distrusting conventionalcare. Some patients may actually benefit from CAM in termsof better well-being due to spiritual practice (32), which isprobably a quite harmless complementary method.Regardless of the reason, few seem to know that specificnatural remedies might actually be harmful (4). Thisunderlines the importance of educating both patients andcaregivers about the various complementary alternativemethods, in order to optimise the discussions of CAM inclinical practice. In this review, a systematic search was conducted of one database, namely PubMed, and no hand search wasundertaken. Consequently, relevant articles might have beenmissed. Inclusion was based on the studies' relevance for thereview aim and not on methodological quality. However, theparticipation rates of the included studies were fairly high,with only two studies reporting less than 50% participation(26.8% and 31.5%, respectively). This has, however, to betaken into account when making conclusions about theresults presented, as such studies can report false results dueto selection bias. If all studies had used the NCCAM'sdefinitions for CAM use, comparisons made in this review Nilsson et al: Review of Complementary Alternative Medicine Use in Scandinavia (Review) 3249would have been more valid. This problem was already raised in a systematic review in 1998 by Ernst et al. , who suggested that studies should have a standardised protocol inorder to make valid conclusions about the prevalence ofCAM use (33). We suggest that further studies are needed to evaluate the true use of CAM among patients with cancer. One waywould be to make a questionnaire-based study including allpatients during their first visit to an Oncology Department ina longitudinal manner. The survey should include all possiblecomplementary treatments and a qualitative follow-up couldbe made based on the results. Moreover, if a personal codenumber is registered, future matching could be made againstregisters, allowing analysis of any association withprognosis, type of cancer, stages of cancer, treatment etc. Conclusion The use of CAM is widespread among patients with cancer, which conventional healthcare providers may not be aware of.Although some patients may benefit from somecomplementary methods, others use agents that may bepotentially harmful. Future research should distinguishbetween seemingly harmless and harmful methods of CAM inorder to understand the effects of dangerous substances onconventional cancer therapy. Knowledge about CAM shouldbe disseminated to both patients and staff in order to optimisediscussions about CAM in clinical practice.
