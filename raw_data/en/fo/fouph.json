We have found that many physical symptoms correlate with unresolved emotional and mental pain. True health is a state of physical, mental, and emotional well-being. As a result, Dr. Tim Murzycki is also extensively trained as a spiritual guide and energy healer, and is happy to offer a free consultation if you would like to explore this aspect of your healing journey. Because we care about your maximum expression of health and enjoyment of life, Dr. Timothy Murzycki also offers group meditations/classes and individual, one-on-one, energetic healing separately from the Chiropractic care in the office. Even though this works beautifully with the Chiropractic care, we gladly welcome anyone from the community whether or not they are currently under Chiropractic care. Our goal is to assist our community through optimal healing and fullest enjoyment of life. Dr. Timothy Murzycki thrives seeing others' successes with energetic healing.
