Real GDP fell 11 percent in the United States and 15 percent in the Euro area in the rst half of 2020, easily the largest drops since World War II.1Because its e ects di er so greatly across sectors and rms, the COVID-19 shock is also likely to drive large- scale reallocation activity. Recent survey evidence (Barrero et al., 2020) and historical evidence (Davis and Haltiwanger, 1992) suggest that most of the reallocation response will involve shifts across rms within industries. Indeed, rm-level stock returns di er enormously in reaction to COVID-19 news and policy responses. To highlight this point, Figure 1 plots daily market-level returns against the same-day interquartile range of rm-level returns on all trading days in 2019 { and on 20 \\jump\" days from 24 February to 27 March 2020 when the market rose or fell by at least 2.5%. Jump days show an extraordinary dispersion in rm-level returns. On 18 March, for instance, the 75th percentile stock had a one-day return advantage of 6.9 percentage points over the 25th percentile, more than 15 standard deviations greater (in 2019 units) than the average cross- rm IQR in 2019. Earnings announcements also underscore the asymmetric impact of COVID-19, with Amazon and Facebook reporting Q2 2020 revenue growth of 40% and 11%, respectively, both large upside surprises amidst a bleak earnings outlook for many rms. We use the discussions of Risk Factors in pre-pandemic 10-K lings to characterize rm-level risk exposures, explain rm-level equity returns on jump days, and interpret the drivers of those returns. The basic idea is simple: When the language rms use to describe their risks explains their stock price reactions to news about the pandemic, for example, it reveals information about the channels through which the market expects the pandemic to a ect their future earnings. We implement this idea in multiple ways. We focus on jump days, because the news event that drove market reactions on those dates is usually apparent. In this regard, we rely on the classi cations in Baker et al. 1See series GDPC1 (United States) and CLVMEURSCAB1GQEA19 (Euro area), both retrieved from FRED on 16 August 2020. 1Mar 17 Mar 02Mar 24 Mar 23 Mar 10 Mar 26Mar 13 Mar 20 Mar 12 Mar 04Mar 09 Mar 27 Mar 11 Feb 27Mar 16 Mar 18 Mar 05Mar 03Feb 24 Feb 251 4 7Daily Cross-Security IQR of Equity Returns, %-12 -7 -2 3 8 Daily Average of Equity Returns, % COVID-19 and Economic Fallout Monetary Policy Easing Fiscal Policy Stimulus Super Tuesday Aftermath Oil Price Crash Unclassified All trading days in 2019^y= 1:0 + 0:45maxf0; xg+ 0:45maxf0;\u0000xg (0.04) (0.05) (0.06) Figure 1: Value-Weighted Mean and Cross-Sectional IQR of U.S. Equity Returns, Daily for 2019 and for Large Daily Jumps in 2020 We consider the value-weighted distribution of daily returns over 2,155 common stocks for all trading days in 2019 and all 20 jump days in 2020 through 27 March. The mean (s.d.) of the daily average return in 2019 is 0.12 (0.80) percent, and the mean (s.d.) of the daily IQR is 1.29 (0.36). The regression has 271 observations and an R-squared of 0.66, with standard errors in parentheses. A test of the null hypothesis that the two rays have equal slopes with opposite signs yields a p-value of 0.99. Jump classi cations follow Baker et al. (2020a), who rely on human readings of next-day newspaper accounts. (2020a), who consult next-day articles about the stock market jump in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal . For the vast majority of COVID-era jump days, the two newspapers advance a common explanation for the jump. Our results show that the text in 10-K lings contains highly granular, quanti able information about the forces that drive rm-level returns. For example, bad news about COVID-19 lowers returns for rms with high exposures to travel, aircraft production, traditional retail and energy supply { directly and via downstream demand linkages { and raises them for rms with high exposures to healthcare policy, e-commerce, web 2services, drug trials and materials that feed into supply chains for semiconductors, cloud computing and telecommunications. We also nd that the structure of rm-level return reactions di ers systematically with the type of news that drove the market, as captured by the jump classi cations. For example, on jump days attributed to monetary policy easing, rm-level returns depend on exposures to in ation, interest rates, and real estate rather than exposures that matter in reaction to pandemic news. As the use of text-as-data expands in economics and nance (Gentzkow et al., 2019a), it becomes ever more important to explore the strengths and weaknesses of di erent text-analytic methods. Under the widely-used dictionary approach (Tetlock, 2007; Loughran and Mcdonald, 2011; Baker et al., 2016), the researcher relies on expert- curated term sets to characterize and quantify the information content in relevant text documents. After extracting content measures, the researcher uses them to explain outcomes of interest. In our implementation of the dictionary approach, we use the term sets that Baker et al. (2019) apply to interpret aggregate stock market volatility. A newer approach, growing in popularity, is supervised machine learning (ML). Under this approach, an algorithm selects the terms in a very large feature space that are useful in explaining an outcome of interest. To implement the ML approach, we adopt the multinomial inverse regression (MNIR) method introduced by Taddy (2013) and recently applied in economics by Gentzkow et al. (2019b). We adopt MNIR because of its relative simplicity, its similarity to discrete-choice statistical models, and its successful application in other economic settings. MNIR di ers in two major respects from the dictionary approach. First, it considers all terms that appear in the discussions of Risk Factors as candidates for explaining returns. The set of all terms is an order of magnitude larger than the term sets encompassed by the curated dictionaries. Second, MNIR weights each term based on the strength of its association with the outcome of interest ( rm-level returns, in our case). In contrast, dictionary approaches typically weight terms based on their frequency in the text documents of interest and perhaps in external sources as well. Despite their di erences, we nd a remarkable congruence in predicted rm-level 3returns between the dictionary and ML approaches. Return predictions from one approach vary one-for-one, on average, with predictions from the other approach. In addition, the adjusted R2values in cross-sectional return regressions vary closely across jump days under the two approaches. At the same time, MNIR achieves a uniformly higher adjusted R2. For example, our MNIR model explains one-half of rm-level abnormal return variation on pandemic fallout days, as compared to one-third under the dictionary approach. As we show, the superior t arises entirely because MNIR draws on a much larger feature space. However, it is hard to obtain clear insights from raw MNIR results. To address this challenge, we proceed in steps. First, we identify seed terms that MNIR weights highly in explaining rm-level returns. In a second step, we use the seeds to automatically generate a set of related terms based on similarity of linguistic context and MNIR weights. Third, we prune the automatically generated lists to obtain term sets that de ne our new risk exposure categories. This process for developing exposure categories and associated term sets draws on both our high-dimensional MNIR model and our domain expertise. In this sense, it incorporates elements of both ML and expert- curated dictionary approaches. Armed with our new term sets, we quantify rm-level exposures to each category. Finally, we incorporate the rm-level exposure measures in straightforward regression models that yield easily interpretable results. When we apply this hybrid approach, we obtain a much richer characterization of the forces that drive rm-level returns. It is how we uncover the role of expo- sures to social distancing restrictions, drug trials, e-commerce and more. It is also how we uncover the role of downstream demand linkages. For example, downstream exposure to aircraft production predicts negative rm-level returns in reaction to bad COVID-19 news. The same news predicts positive returns for rms with high exposures to speci c metals (e.g., tantalum and tungsten) that are critical for semiconductors, lasers, integrated circuits and for cloud computing and telecommunications. Acemoglu et al. (2016) show how downstream demand shocks operate in theory by propagating 4upstream through the production network.2Our results highlight the role of the pro- duction network for understanding the e ects of the COVID-19 shock. While evidence of COVID-19's impact on nal consumer spending is now plentiful (Andersen et al., 2020; Baker et al., 2020b; Carvalho et al., 2020; Chetty et al., 2020; Cox et al., 2020; Surico et al., 2020), we show that its impact on input demands is also important. Dictionary methods and supervised ML are sometimes seen to occupy opposite ends of a methodological spectrum. Our study shows they are complements as much as substitutes. In this regard, our hybrid approach to uncovering risk factors and con- structing associated term sets is useful more broadly. As a further illustration, we use the hybrid approach to characterize returns the day after the 2020 Super Tuesday elec- tions. The market rose 4% in reaction to these elections, widely regarded as a decisive victory for Joe Biden that greatly raised his chances of securing the Democratic nom- ination. We again apply our hybrid approach to uncover risk factors, build associated term sets, and use them to explain rm-level returns. We nd that Super Tuesday drove negative returns for rms with high exposure to hotels, gambling, fracking, and nancial management; and positive returns for rms with high exposure to healthcare, health insurance, REITs, property rentals, communications and construction. An active literature considers how rm-level equity returns have responded to COVID-19. Here, we take note of a few studies that are particularly relevant to ours. Hassan et al. (2020) use natural language processing methods and human readings to quantify what rms say about COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in their earnings calls. They aggregate over their rm-level measures to show how sentiments related to COVID-19 vary by country and time.3They also show that equity returns are lower in 2020 for rms that express greater concern about COVID-19 in their earnings calls. Our approach yields much more granular measures of business risk exposures, which we use to explain rm-level return reactions to distinct types of news events. Our reliance 2Other relevant theoretical analyses include Long and Plosser (1983), Atalay (2017), and Baqaee and Farhi (2019). See Carvalho and Tahbaz-Salehi (2019) for a review. 3Stephany et al. (2020) use the text in 10-K lings to track the evolution of COVID-related concerns at aggregate and industry levels. 5on 10-K lings before the pandemic struck yields an ex ante characterization of risk ex- posures rather than an ex post one. Our approach also yields a fuller characterization of risk exposures, because rms face legal and nancial liabilities for failing to disclose material risks in their regulatory lings (Mast et al., 2020). In contrast, earnings calls tend to focus on a limited set of salient concerns. Papanikolaou and Schmidt (2020) and Pagano et al. (2020) use industry di erences in employee ability to work from home (WFH) to explain rm-level returns (and other outcomes) in the wake of COVID-19. Their evidence ts well with our nding that bad COVID-19 news triggers positive return reactions at rms with high exposure to web services, the demand for which rises with reliance on remote interactivity. Our evidence about rm-level returns is largely distinct from the evidence in these two studies and others that use industry-level variation to characterize risk exposures. When we control for industry xed e ects, our text-based measures continue to have ample explanatory power for rm-level returns, underscoring how risk exposures and return reactions vary greatly even among rms in the same industry. Laeven (2020) nds that social distancing measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic a ect rms partly through input-output linkages. Ramelli and Wagner (2020) stress the role of upstream supply shocks due to disrupted exports from China, especially in the early stages of the pandemic. We focus on the period during which COVID-19 emerged as a global, rather than Chinese, health crisis and nd an important role for many aspects of supply-chain linkages in driving rm-level abnormal return reactions to news about COVID-19. A broader nance literature uses the Risk Factors to study equity returns, but few papers incorporate machine learning methods. Hanley and Hoberg (2019) and Lopez Lira (2019) use unsupervised learning approaches to group 10-K words into clusters that correlate with stock returns. Ke et al. (2019) propose a supervised learn- ing framework for predicting stock returns using media text data, which they show outperforms standard sentiment dictionaries at return prediction. Our study is more focused on organizing terms into interpretable categories that inform an understanding 6of what drives rm-level return reactions to common shocks. The next section discusses our data sources, the dictionary approach, and MNIR. Section 3 presents results based on the dictionary approach. Section 4 implements the MNIR approach, establishes a close relationship between the return predictions generated by the two approaches, and shows that MNIR delivers better tting models. We also show that a standard clustering algorithm applied to MNIR return predictions sorts jump days into categories that align closely with the classi cation that Baker et al. (2020a) derive from next-day newspaper accounts of large market-level moves. Section 5 develops and implements our hybrid approach, rst applying it to pandemic- related jump days and then to Super Tuesday. Section 6 shows that our text-based models of rm-level abnormal returns also have strong predictive content for corporate earnings surprises. Section 7 concludes. 2 Data and Empirical Methods 2.1 Firm-level returns and other nancial measures We consider daily returns for 2,155 equity securities on the 20 jump days from 24 February to 27 March that Baker et al. (2020a) identify and classify. To compute returns, we obtain daily closing prices (PRCCD) of common equities traded on AMEX, NYSE and NASDAQ from the Compustat North America Security Daily le. We account for stock splits, dividends, etc. using the daily adjustment factor (AJEXDI) and the daily total return factor (TRFD) in the same Compustat le. We restrict attention to U.S.-incorporated rms with share prices quoted in U.S. Dollars. See Appendix A for more information about our sample. Figure B.1 displays an analog to Figure 1 that considers the cross- rm standard deviation of daily returns in place of the IQR. Figures B.2 to B.4 display histograms of daily market-level returns, the IQR of rm-level returns, and the standard deviation of rm-level returns for trading days in 2019 alongside analogous statistics for the jump 7days in 2020. These gures reinforce the chief message of Figure 1: The jump days in our sample are extreme events with respect to both market-level returns and the dispersion of rm-level returns. Our main outcomes of interest are rm-level abnormal returns constructed in the standard way. Speci cally, we generate daily security-level abnormal returns for jump days as the di erence between (i) a stock's actual return in excess of the risk free rate and (ii) its expected excess return per the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM): Abn i;t=log\u0012pi;t pi;t\u00001\u0013 \u0000Rf;t\u0000beta i\u0002\u0000 RM;t\u0000Rf;t\u0001 share price for stock ion dayt,Rfdenotes the four- week treasury bill rate (a proxy for the risk free rate), beta iis the stock's CAPM beta, andRMis the value-weighted average market return. We estimate each stock's beta using an OLS regression of its daily excess return on the contemporaneous market-level excess return in the sample of all trading days in 2019. Our statistical models for (abnormal) returns include two controls for nancial characteristics. The rst is a measure of the rm's equity market capitalization, Mcapit, computed as shares outstanding (CSHOC) times closing price per share.4The second is rm leverage, computed as (long term debt (DLTT) + current liabilities (DLC)) divided by total assets (AT). We use the most recent data in the Compustat le for this purpose, yielding leverage values based on scal year 2019 (2018) for 89 (11) percent of rms. Appendix Table B.1 reports descriptive statistics for these and other variables used in our rm-level analyses. 2.2 The Risk Factors text in 10-K les Since 2006 (for scal year 2005), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has required the vast majority of publicly held rms to include a discussion of Risk Factors 4In a slight abuse of notation, we often refer to ias a rm whereas it actually indexes stocks. In the few cases where a rm has multiple stocks, we assign the same Mcapitvalue to each one. 8(RF) in Part 1a of their annual 10-K lings. The SEC advises that these discussions include any item that could impact future earnings. Investors can sue for compensation if the rm omits material information or risks (Mast et al., 2020). We use RFtexts led from 2010 to July 2016. (Machine-readable versions are available from EDGAR.) This choice of years mitigates the role of idiosyncratic language in a single ling and ensures that any relationship we nd between the RFtext and returns in 2020 re ects persistent risk exposures that long predate the arrival of COVID-19. Appendix A describes how we pre-process the raw text les to obtain documents composed of words and phrases. After pre-processing, there are 18,911 unique terms that appear a total of 57 million times in our RFcorpus. The large number of terms necessitates some form of dimension reduction, which we accomplish in two distinct ways: rst, curated dictionaries that identify terms of interest and organize them into categories; second, Taddy's (2013, 2015) MNIR model, which operates on all terms. 2.3 Empirical approach 1: Curated dictionaries We adopt the dictionaries of Baker et al. (2019), who expand on ones previously devel- oped by Baker et al. (2016) and Davis (2017). One attraction of these dictionaries is their detail. They include 16 dictionaries that cover aspects of economic and nancial conditions and another 20 that pertain to policy areas. Each one contains numerous terms that e ectively de ne the dictionary's category. The construction of these dic- tionaries re ects the input and judgment of expert economists drawing on textbooks, newspaper articles, 10-K lings, and \\their own knowledge of economic matters and input from other economists in seminars and personal communications.\" Baker et al. (2019) show that these dictionaries are useful for tracking and interpreting movements in stock market volatility, which is conceptually related to stock market jumps. The dictionaries contain 430 terms that appear in our RFcorpus, 244 after remov- ing rare terms at the pre-processing stage.5These 244 terms appear nearly 1.4 million 5Three Baker et al. (2019) dictionaries { foreign trade exposure, immigration policy, and government-sponsored enterprises { contain only rare terms. We drop these three categories in our 9times, constituting 2.4% of the RFcorpus. The RFtexts for a given rm contain 28 distinct dictionary terms on average (standard deviation of 10) and 642 instances of dictionary terms (standard deviation of 620). To quantify a rm's exposure to a given risk category, we identify sentences in its RFtexts that contain at least one term in the corresponding dictionary.6After computing the fraction of such sentences in each of the rm's RFtexts, we calculate the average fraction. In this way, we obtain 36 rm- level exposure values, one for each category and its associated dictionary. Descriptive statistics for these rm-level exposure measures appear in table B.1. 2.4 Empirical approach 2: Multinomial inverse regression MNIR treats the RFtexts for each rm ias a bag-of-words represented by a V- dimensional vector xiof terms or \\features.\" xi;vis the count of term vfor rmi, and V= 18;911 is the number of unique terms in our RFcorpus. At the rm level, the average number of nonzero elements in xiis 2,245, with a standard deviation of 891. Many popular machine learning approaches to text analysis in economics and - nance (e.g., latent Dirichlet allocation) represent documents in a latent space of \\top- ics.\" These approaches reduce the dimensionality of text but can yield topics that lack clear relationships to the outcomes of interest. MNIR models the relationship between the terms in xiand the outcomes of interest directly. The resulting statistical structure is similar to ones that arise in standard econometric models of discrete choice. Taddy's (2013) original MNIR model was inspired by an economics application (Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010), and it has been further applied in Gentzkow et al. (2019b). These obser- vations suggest that MNIR is a promising tool for the text-based analysis of rm-level returns and for exploring how machine learning methods can extend and complement the use of dictionary methods in economics and nance. MNIR posits xi\u0018MN(qi;Ni), where qiis a multinomial V-dimensional probability implementation of the dictionary approach. Retaining them has little impact on the results. 6We handle plurals using the NLTK WordNet Lemmatizer. For example, and sions\" are both captured by the \\Broad Indicators\" category reported in Appendix A.3. 10vector and Niis the number of terms in rm i'sRFtexts (i.e., rm- iabnormal returns on a given day or collection of days and rm controls ci2RP. (We suppress time subscripts here.) avis a parameter that controls for the baseline frequency of term vin the corpus, and bvis aP+ 1 vector of coe\u000ecients that describe how rm observables map to the probability that termvappears in the RFtexts. Equation (2) describes a multinomial logistic regression over Vfeatures, which we t to 2,155 observations (per jump day), one per rm. The outcome being modeled is the probability that a particular term in Vappears in a random draw from the rm's RFtexts. The tted model delivers 18,911 estimated probabilities for 2,155 rms. The non-standard aspect of (2) is the high dimensionality of V. So, we estimate (2) using Bayesian regularization methods with a Gamma-Laplace prior structure on the regression coe\u000ecients. (This estimation method is a more exible form of the standard LASSO penalty, one that admits coe\u000ecient-speci c penalization.) The selection of the prior trades o goodness-of- t and model complexity via the maximization of an information criterion to avoid over- tting. See Taddy (2013, 2015) for details. We seek to use RFtext features to predict returns, while (2) models the inverse relationship of term probabilities given returns. To move from estimates of (2) to a forward regression with Abn ias the dependent variable, we follow Taddy (2013) and de ne a su\u000ecient reduction projection zi=P vxi;vb1;vwith the property Abn i?xij zi;Ni;ci. Thus, conditional on the scalar projection zi, the high-dimensional raw data contain no extra predictive information for returns. This result does not specify the functional form for relating zitoAbn iin a forward regression, but it says we can model Abn ias a function of zi,Ni,ci, while disregarding xi. 112.5 Why two empirical approaches? We adopt two distinct approaches to the analysis of rm-level equity returns for two reasons. First, we want to compare their strengths and weaknesses in a rich, concrete setting. Second, we want to explore whether and how researchers can enrich their text-based analyses by combining elements of both approaches. A clear advantage of the dictionary approach is it simplicity and transparency. Its implementation does not require the estimation of a rst-stage statistical model, as in the inverse regression model (2). It relies instead on domain expertise, as codi ed in the dictionaries, to organize and quantify the text data and to use the resulting quanti cation to explain outcomes of interest. A key advantage of MNIR (in common with all supervised learning models) is the ability to use all terms in the text corpus to explain the outcomes of interest. In our context, that means using the RFtexts to explain systematic aspects of rm- level return reactions to pandemic-related news and other common shocks. Our MNIR model considers all 18,911 terms in our RF corpus, while the dictionary approach considers only 244 terms organized into 36 categories. As a result of its much larger feature space, MNIR can potentially capture aspects of the rm-level returns structure that the dictionary approach misses. Two claims often arise in comparisons between dictionary and ML methods. First, that dictionary methods more readily yield results with clear interpretations. Second, that ML methods require less need for domain expertise or its costly codi cation. Each claim contains a kernel of truth, but the reality is more complex in our setting. In particular, dictionary methods often but not always yield easy-to-interpret results. We show how to use ML methods to sharpen the interpretations of dictionary-based results. Conversely, we also show how to use dictionary methods and domain expertise to interpret results that emerge from an MNIR implementation of the ML approach. 123 Results Based on the Dictionary Approach To implement the dictionary approach, we t regression models for daily rm-level returns via least-squares estimation. Our models rm-i's abnormal return on day t, RExpj iis its exposure to risk category j= 1;2;:::;36;Leverageiand Mcapitare the nancial controls de ned earlier, and s(i) are NAICS2 xed e ects. Apart from xed e ects, all regressors enter (3) in standard deviation units. We t (3) separately for each jump day or collection of same-type jump days according to the classi cation in Figure 1. When tting to a collection of days, we use average values of Abn itand log(Mcapit) for the days in question. The collection of scal policy jumps includes three days with a positive market return and one, 23 March, with a negative return in reaction to a delay in passing a scal relief bill. To account for this sign ip, we multiply rm-level abnormal returns on 23 March by -1 before averaging over the jump days attributed to scal policy. Table 1 reports estimates of (3), suppressing coe\u000ecients that are insigni cant at the 10 percent level. Our simple model explains much of the (very large) abnormal return variation on jump days: Adjusted R2values range from 20% the day after Super Tuesday to 33% on pandemic fallout days and 36% for the March 9 Oil Price Crash. While not our focus, we observe that market cap is a highly signi cant return predictor on jump days. Consistent with Alfaro et al. (2020) and Ramelli and Wagner (2020), more leveraged rms perform worse in reaction to bad news about the pandemic. Many of our dictionary-based exposure measures are also signi cant return predic- tors. As seen in Column (1), rms with high exposures to in ation, credit indicators , taxes, entitlement programs, energy and environmental regulations, andtransportation, infrastructure and utilities react especially negatively to bad news about the pandemic and its economic fallout.

As reported in Table B.1, 21 rms (1% of our sample) have intellectual property exposures more than 3.5 standard deviations greater than the mean exposure, which implies a one-day pos- itive abnormal return di erential on pandemic fallout days of at least (0.45)(3.5)= 1.6 percentage points for these rms.7The intellectual property category is especially relevant for pharmaceutical rms, as its dictionary includes \\patent\" and \\new drug application.\" Thus, the large, positive coe\u000ecient on intellectual property ts well with the view that bad news about the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is relatively good for rms that own or develop healthcare-related intellectual property. Looking across the columns in Table 1, the structure of rm-level return reactions di ers systematically by jump type. For example, jumps attributed to monetary policy easing yield large positive return reactions for rms with high exposures to in ation and interest rates but not to intellectual property ortransportation, infrastructure and utilities. Jump days attributed to scal policy news generate the largest return reac- tion at rms with high exposure to the taxcategory. Firms exposed to tax-sensitive categories like real estate and business investment also outperform on scal policy jump days. However, the precise interpretation of some of these patterns is unclear. The tax category, for example, captures exposures to both high taxes and the potential for large tax credits (e.g., for R&D or investment). This example illustrates the interpretation challenges that can arise under the dictionary approach. Several exposure measures play a role in driving rm-level return reactions to the Super Tuesday elections, including real estate, commodity markets, intellectual prop- erty, and nancial regulation . These reactions re ect revised assessments of Job Biden's (and Bernie Sanders') prospects of becoming the Democratic Party's presidential nomi- nee, how the general election campaign would play out in view of the expected nominee, and the likelihood that Donald Trump would win re-election. The revision in assess- 7Examples include Universal Display Corporation with an intellectual property exposure 5.7 stan- dard deviations greater than the mean exposure, Editas Medicine, Inc. (5.6), Interdigital, Inc. (5.4), Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (5.1), Gilead Sciences (4.9), Kindred Biosciences (4.7), Biolife (4.5), Qual- comm (4.4) and Blueprint Medicines (4.0). 15ments a ect relative returns positively at rms exposed to real estate, for example, and negatively at rms exposed to commodity markets, e.g., oil and gas companies. The Oil Price Crash came with a huge 7.9 percentage point drop in the overall stock market on 9 March. As reported in Column (5), rms with high exposure to commodity markets and energy and environmental regulations experienced especially large stock price drops. Consider a rm at the 99th exposure percentile for commodity markets. According to Table B.1, this rm's commodity markets exposure is 4.6 standard devi- ation units greater than the average rm's exposure. Thus, conditional on the other covariates in (3), the estimated model predicts that the 99th percentile rm has a one- day negative abnormal return di erential of ( \u00001:73)(4:6) =\u00008:0 percentage points. This calculation illustrates a broader point: Some rms have extremely high exposures to one or a small number of risk categories. As a result, big shocks that pertain to particular exposure categories can drive very large rm-level return di erentials. To summarize, our implementation of the dictionary approach yields an initial characterization of rm-level reactions to various market-moving news events in the wake of COVID-19. Some ambiguities arise when seeking to interpret the results, perhaps because the dictionaries were not speci cally designed to characterize stock market behavior on our particular jump days. Moreover, as we have stressed, the dictionary approach taps only a small fraction of the RFcorpus. 4 Exploiting the Full RFCorpus 4.1 How much gain in t from MNIR? We estimate the inverse regression (2) separately for each jump day or collection of days with controls cit= (Leveragei;log(Mcapit); s(i)). estimate by ordinary least squares. Niis the number of terms in rm i'sRF texts, andzitis the su\u000ecient reduction projection that summarizes the information in the inverse regression. We rst examine the gain in t achieved by MNIR relative to the dictionary approach. To do so, we separately estimate (3) and (4) for each of the 17 jump days covered by Table 1. There are two reasons why MNIR might have greater explanatory power. First, (2) allows more exibility in the relationship between returns and terms. Because (2) is t with regularization, terms are selected or not based on the strength of their association with returns. Moreover, selected terms can have di erent regression coe\u000ecients. In contrast, the dictionary approach constrains all terms in the same category to have the same relationship to returns. There is, for instance, no down weighting of terms in a given dictionary that are less helpful in quantifying return-relevant exposures. Second, MNIR operates on a vastly larger feature space. Insofar as there is useful information about returns in the 18,667 terms (= 18 ;911\u0000244) not classi ed in the dictionaries, we expect MNIR to achieve a better t. To distinguish between these two possible reasons for a better t, we also estimate MNIR using just the 244 dictionary terms. To summarize, we t three sets of regressions and obtain three sets of adjusted R2values corresponding to (i) the dictionary approach, (ii) MNIR based on the 244 dictionary terms, and (iii) MNIR based on all 18,911 terms. Figure 2 displays the results. Figure 2a shows that the two approaches achieve essentially the same t when using the same terms, and that this result holds across jump days. That is, the greater exibility of MNIR in how it relates returns to terms does not materially improve goodness of t. Whatever interpretation value the dictio- nary approach o ers by organizing terms into categories does not come at the expense of model t { at least not in our application with our dictionaries. Figure 2b compares the dictionary approach to the MNIR implementation that uses all terms in the RFcorpus. Here, we see a uniformly better t for MNIR. The t gain is large: The adjusted R2value is roughly 20 percentage points higher under MNIR on all jump days. The implication is that, at least in our setting, the supervised 17^y= 0:015 + 0 in MNIR Figure 2: R2achieved via Dictionary and Machine Learning Approaches This gure plots the adjusted R2from regressions (3) and (4). The left panel displays results when using only the 244 dictionary terms as inputs into the MNIR model, while the right panel displays results when using all terms. Each plot presents a tted regression line that relates the R2values (solid black line), along with 95% con dence intervals corresponding to the shaded region. The dashed line is the 45-degree line. machine learning approach more fully explains returns entirely because it considers a much larger set of terms than the dictionary approach. Figure 2b carries a subtler message than supervised learning ts better. In particu- lar, there is a close, approximately one-for-one relationship across jump days between theR2values for the two approaches. The con dence interval for the slope coe\u000ecient relating the R2values contains 1. This result suggests that MNIR and the dictionaries draw on similar information to explain returns, since their ability to do so is highly correlated across jump days. Next, we develop this point more fully. 184.2 Comparing predicted rm-level returns Figure 3 plots tted values for abnormal returns using the dictionary approach against the corresponding MNIR predictions (using all terms). To construct this gure, we t abnormal return models separately for the 17 jump days to obtain 36,635 predictions under each approach. Remarkably, the regression line that relates the two sets of predicted outcomes is indistinguishable from the 45 degree line. In other words, the predicted rm-level return from the dictionary approach is an unbiased estimate of the MNIR prediction. This result also holds on each individual jump day. ^y=\u00000:002 + 1 :012x (0.015) (0.004) Figure 3: Fitted Values from Dictionary and Machine Learning Approaches This gure plots tted values from regressions (3) and (4), pooled across all 17 dates. It also presents a tted regression line that relates the two (solid black line). Con dence bands are omitted from the graph due to their narrowness at standard levels. The dashed line is the 45 degree line. One might worry that this one-for-one relationship is an artifact of including indus- try xed e ects under both approaches. To check this, we drop industry e ects and re t models that focus on the text-based measures. Figure B.7 displays the results. In the pooled sample, we continue to nd a near one-for-one relationship in tted ab- 19normal returns between the two approaches. There is also a close, near one-for-one relationship on most { but not all { individual jump days. For example, the regression slope is only 0.822 on 24 March. Thus, the striking result in Figure 3 is not an artifact of industry e ects or the consequence of some other mechanical e ect. While predictions under the two approaches coincide on average, predicted return distributions di er in the higher moments. Figure 4 summarizes the predicted ab- normal return distributions under several speci cations. The dispersion of predicted returns is similar when including sector xed e ects alone or dictionary measures alone (including nancial controls in both cases), as shown by comparing the second and third box plots in Figure 4. Using both industry e ects and dictionary measures yields somewhat greater dispersion in predicted returns. Using MNIR yields a considerably more dispersed distribution of predicted returns, con rming that it captures additional return-relevant information in the RFcorpus. 4.3 Text-based measures and narrow industry classi cations We now ask whether our text sources and methods capture information about returns beyond what is captured by narrow industry de nitions. An a\u000ermative answer provides evidence about rm heterogeneity and o ers a means to characterize it. The question is also important in the context of the COVID-19 literature. Both Pagano et al. (2020) and Papanikolaou and Schmidt (2020) construct industry-level exposures (up to NAICS4 granularity) to restrictions on labor supply due to the inability of employees to work from home. They argue that di erences in this source of exposure drive much of the rm-level variation in stock returns during 2020. By controlling for narrowly de ned industries, we can assess whether text-based measures pick up information beyond the supply-side shocks that these studies highlight. 2010 4.75 -.5 -5.75 -11Abnormal Equity Return, Percents Fitted Return Industry FEFitted Return Financials + DictionaryFitted Financials + Industry FE + DictionaryFitted Return MNIR SpecificationObserved Abnormal Return Figure 4: Range of Firm-Level (Fitted) Returns This gure considers all 2,155 securities and 17 jump days in our analysis sample. For each speci cation, we generate tted abnormal returns at the security-day level and generate the corresponding boxplots. The upper (lower) whisker represents the largest (smallest) observation that is less (greater) than or equal to the third ( rst) quartile plus (minus) 1.5*IQR. 21There are 216 unique NAICS4 industries in our baseline sample, from which we drop the 287 rms that lie in industry codes with fewer than ve rms overall or with no available NAICS4 code. This leaves a subsample containing 1,868 rms distributed over 97 unique NAICS4 codes. For each jump day, we model abnormal returns as depending on rm nancial controls and NAICS4 xed e ects, and we record the adjusted R2. We then add the dictionary exposures and the su\u000ecient reduction projection, respectively, and we again record the adjusted R2. Figure 5 plots the results. (a)Dictionary Method (b)Machine Learning Method Figure 5: Improvement in R2beyond Narrow Industry Codes This gure plots adjusted R2values from regression models t to rm-level returns on jump days. The horizontal scale shows the adjusted R2in models with NAICS4 xed e ects and rm-level nancial controls. The vertical scale shows the adjusted R2values that result when adding dictionary-based measures (panel (a)) or the su\u000ecient reduction projection estimated in (2) (panel (b)). Models are t to the subsample of rms that lie in NAICS4 industries with ve or more rms. Figure 5a shows that adding dictionary measures does not shrink the residual vari- ance in the return regressions, conditional on narrowly de ned industry controls. That does not mean dictionary measures are uninformative about return drivers, but they don't improve model t relative to detailed industry controls. In contrast, Figure 5b 22shows that including the su\u000ecient reduction projection yields a large R2gain on every jump day.8In Section 5, we develop an approach to uncovering and interpreting the additional information about return drivers captured by MNIR. 4.4 Clustering jump days based on return structures Recall that Baker et al. (2020a) use human readings of next-day newspaper accounts to classify market-level jumps as to reason (pandemic fallout, scal policy, etc.). We now apply an automated approach to classify jump days based on the structure of predicted rm-level abnormal returns. For this exercise, we measure returns in (2), (3), and (4) as Abn it\u0002(5.5=AvgER t), where 5.5 is the average market-level move in our sample of 17 jump days. This rescaling of returns ensures that our clustering re ects the structure of abnormal returns and nottheir overall magnitude or direction. We then t our regression models separately by day and build a 17 \u000217 matrix, where the (t1;t2) element is the correlation between the day- t1 tted values and the day- t2 tted values. Given this matrix, we apply a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm to group like days together, and display the results as dendograms in Figure 6.9 The dendograms reveal two interesting results. First, we obtain similar cluster- ings of jump days under the dictionary and ML approaches. This result reinforces our earlier conclusion that these two very di erent methodologies yield congruent re- turn predictions. Second, the clustering that emerges from our automated analysis of rm-level return structures based on Risk Factors texts in 10-K les is similar to the newspaper-based classi cation of market-level jumps in Baker et al. (2020a). The 8This result holds even though we estimate the inverse regression model (2) on a sample of 2,155 rms, which involves a potentially di erent relationship between terms and returns than the smaller sample of rms considered in Figure 5. 9The clustering algorithm works as follows. Start with a separate cluster for each jump day. In step 1, group the two days with the highest correlation of tted values, yielding 16 clusters. Again compute the correlation between each cluster, using the minimum correlation value between all cross-cluster observations as the similarity metric when the cluster covers more than one day. This is known as `complete link clustering'. Repeat this process until all observations lie in a single cluster. The height of the dendogram corresponds to the similarity level at which clusters are merged. See, for example, chapter 17 of Manning et al. (2009) for more details. 23similarity is particularly evident for the MNIR approach. With few exceptions, the clustering algorithm groups the \\ scal\" and \\monetary policy\" jumps (according to newspaper-based approach) into distinct blocks, as it does for the \\pandemic fallout\" jumps. Interestingly, the clustering algorithm groups Super Tuesday with other policy jumps, and it groups the oil price crash with other pandemic fallout days. These results support the idea that the Super Tuesday elections shifted expectations about future polices, while the oil price collapse shifted other aspects of the economic outlook. We conclude that identi able categories of news events di er in how they interact with rm-level risk exposures to drive the structure of rm-level return reactions. (a)Dictionary Method (b)Machine Learning Method Figure 6: Clustering of Days via Di erent Methods This gure displays dendograms that represent clusterings of our 17 event days. In the left-hand panel, we cluster days based on the correlation matrix of the tted values from (3) t with Abn it\u0002(5.5=AvgER t) as the dependent variable; in the right-hand panel, we cluster days based instead on the tted values from (4) t with the same dependent variable. In both cases, we use a complete-link hierarchical clustering algorithm, and color-code days in line with manually-assigned labels. 245 Uncovering and Interpreting Risk Factors We now use our MNIR model to uncover and interpret the risk exposures that drive return reactions, a di erent undertaking than the usual prediction-oriented application of machine learning. The major challenge here is to organize the thousands of estimated model parameters in an insightful way. A rst step in this direction is to exploit the grouping of jump days in Figure 1 and Section 3. From there, we use MNIR models to develop new exposure measures that yield insights into how shocks a ect the structure of rm-level returns. Our rst application is to pandemic fallout days. 5.1 Risk exposures for pandemic fallout days When t to pandemic fallout days, our MNIR model places positive weight on 9,948 terms and negative weight on 8,389 terms (574 terms are not selected into the model). Table B.2 displays terms with the largest positive and negative inverse regression coef- cients on abnormal returns, given by b1;v;the rst element of bvin (2). These terms suggest a more granular characterization of exposures than the baseline dictionaries. For example, while both \\wheat\" and \\oil\" appear in the dictionary for Commodity Markets , \\wheat\" is the term most associated with positive returns and \\oil\" is among those associated with negative returns. A natural interpretation is that pandemic news shifted their demands in opposite directions. Wheat is an input into basic food pro- duction, which remained stable as the pandemic unfolded. In contrast, oil supports the physical movement of goods and people, which fell dramatically. Other important terms include \\games,\" \\optics,\" \\patents\" and \\clinical \\jet fuel\" returns. Certain companies also feature prominently: \\Intel\" has a high association with positive returns, and \\Delta,\" \\Phillips\" and \\Boeing\" have high associations with negative returns. Since we drop terms that appear in the RFtexts of fewer than 25 rms, these ndings say that the return reactions of many rms are strongly a ected 25by their commercial connections to these companies. We can inspect return drivers for individual rms as well. Table 2 lists the ten rms with the greatest residual shrinkage when adding the su\u000ecient reduction projection to the regression model.10The table provides a short business description for each rm and lists its top ve terms { calculated as ^b1;vtimes the rm's tf-idf score for the corresponding term, xi;vlog(2133 d fv);wherexi;vis the count of term vin rmi'sRFtexts anddfvis the number of rms that use term vin their RFtexts.11For example, top terms in predicting a positive return reaction to bad pandemic news for Net ix re ect its digital video services. The top terms for predicting a positive reaction for Novavax, which develops vaccines, include \\vaccine\" and \\clinical trials.\" Marcus Corporation o ers an example of a rm with exposures that create reinforcing negative return reactions, as it operates both hotels and cinemas. 5.2 Uncovering risk exposures: A systematic approach To construct risk exposures, we start with \\seeds\" drawn from (a) terms with large MNIR coe\u000ecients, j^b1;vj; and (b) terms coe\u000ecients, j^b1;vjxvlog(2133 d fv), wherexvis the count of term vin the RFcorpus. We work with 45 seeds that re ect both positive and negative return reactions and that appear to cover the main exposures surfaced by our MNIR model t to pandemic-related jump days. Table 3 reports the seeds and corresponding category names. Next, we use the seeds to build sets comprised of related terms. Speci cally, we deploy the popular word2vec model of word embeddings to obtain a vector that, for each termv2f1;:::;Vg, characterizes the (average) semantic context of words in close proximity to vin our RFcorpus.12We then use these vectors to group terms 10Figure B.8 shows that predicted returns for these rms align more closely with actual returns as we go from a no-text model to one that includes dictionary-based measures to MNIR. Echoing results in Section 4, the two text-based approaches yield concordant results, but MNIR captures more information and yields better predictions. 11The log(2133 d fv) expression down weights generic terms that are less useful in distinguishing among rms. 2133 is the number of rms for which we have 10-K lings, so a term that appears in the 10-Ks of every rm gets zero weight. 12See Mikolov et al. (2013). In our application of word2vec, each word embedding is characterized 26Company Business description Terms tf-idf x MNIR coe .

For each rm, we report ve terms with the largest positive or negative MNIR coe\u000ecient in the rm-speci c su\u000ecient reduction projection when multiplied by tf-idf scores to down weight generic terms. 27that are similar with respect to surrounding language in the corpus. This approach groups nearly identical terms like \\pipeline\" and \\pipelines\" and semantically similar terms like \\cheese\" and \\foods.\" However, it neglects the fact that semantically related words can di er in the sign of their relationship to returns, as with \\oil\" and \\wheat.\" Thus, we must account for both semantic similarity and relationship to returns. And, as in Table 2, we want to down weight generic terms that are less helpful in capturing exposures that di er among rms. In view of these multiple considerations, we build new term sets by associating each seed with terms in the RFcorpus that meet two criteria: 1. High speci city and same sign: Among terms vwith an MNIR coe\u000ecient of the same sign as the one for the seed, we select those with j^b1;vjxvlog(2133 d fv)>200. 2. High contextual similarity, as measured by cosine similarity of the embedding vectors: In practice, we require a term's embedding vector to have a cosine similarity greater than 0.4 with that of the seed. Higher thresholds yield more suitable terms at the cost of excluding potentially relevant terms. Lower thresholds capture additional terms but at the cost of less suitability. We adjust the thresholds to strike a reasonable balance between these concerns. Applying criterion 1 yields 8,513 seed-generated terms. Further applying criterion 2 leaves us with 1,100 terms in addition to the 45 seeds. When a term meets both criteria for multiple seeds, we assign it to the seed for which its cosine similarity is highest. Appendix C.1 lists all terms grouped with each seed under this approach. By and large, the term sets re ect coherent exposure categories, even when the seed is highly speci c. For example, tantalum (a rare earth metal) is a key input into the manufacture of electronic circuits and equipment. The set seeded by \\tantalum\" contains other key by a 200-element vector selected to maximize the probability of observing vin the corpus, conditional on a surrounding window of plus or minus ve words. Our choice of 200 elements for the embedding vector and a proximity lter of +/- ve words is fairly standard in the NLP literature. In practice, researchers evaluate the quality of embedding models based on downstream performance. As we will show, the exposure categories and term sets derived using our embedding models perform well in explaining and interpreting rm-level abnormal returns. 28Seed Name Retained Terms Dropped Terms advertisers Advertizing 9 5 biodiesel Alternative Energy 10 17 card Card Payments 25 0 clearing house Clearing Houses 3 0 hotels Commercial Property 18 3 display Display Technology 16 13 unrealized loss position Financial Management 15 0 yen Foreign Exchange 5 0 franchisees Franchising 13 0 gaming Gambling 5 0 gold Gold and Silver 2 5 surgeons Healthcare Providers 6 1 reinsurance Insurance 23 0 mortgage Mortgages 44 0 reit REITs 29 0 homebuilding Residential Construction 4 0 restaurants Restaurants 3 13 retail Traditional Retail 26 9 workforces Workforce 2 0 aircraft Aircraft and Airlines 10 10 travel Travel 11 6 satellite Communications 22 0 newspapers Traditional Media 20 3 pipelines Energy Infrastructure 26 11 oil Oil and Gas 11 0 (a)Negative Exposures Seed Name Retained Terms Dropped Terms preclinical Drug Trials 43 0 ecommerce Ecommerce 12 11 optics Electronic Components and Devices 74 20 wheat Foodstu s 27 2 china Foreign Countries 62 0 medicare Health Insurance 35 0 investment funds Investment Funds 15 0 manufacturing Manufacturing 35 5 steel Metal Products 21 0 coal Power Generation 13 0 tantalum Raw Metals and Minerals 11 3 semiconductor Semiconductors 15 5 games Video Games 21 4 cloud Web-Based Services 23 2 bank Banking 40 0 fdic Deposits 20 0 vessels Shipping Containers 12 1 freight Transportation 21 0 solutions Software Services 65 8 software Software and Hardware Products 56 9 (b)Positive Exposures Table 3: MNIR-Generated Exposure Categories for Pandemic Fallout Dates This table lists the 45 \\seeds\" that we use to construct MNIR-generated exposure categories and term sets. The last two columns report how many automatically generated terms we retain and drop after judgmental pruning. We combine closely related exposure categories in our downstream analysis, as indicated by those with the same font color. 29inputs in the manufacturing supply chain for electronic components and \\democratic republic of congo,\" a major source country for rare earth mineral mining. Next, we manually prune the automatically generated term sets, deleting highly generic terms and those at high risk of referring to other concepts (as fully described in appendix C.1). Continuing with the tantalum example, we delete \\adjoining countries,\" \\requirements for companies,\" and \\sheet.\" Table 3 reports the number of deleted and retained terms in each category. Lastly, we compute rm-level exposures to each cate- goryjand its associated term set, L(j), aszj i=P v2L(j)xi;vjb1;vj, which captures the part of the su\u000ecient reduction projection that derives from terms in L(j). We combine categories with correlation higher than 0.7 across rms, which consolidates closely re- lated categories such as \\Software and Hardware Products\" and \\Software Services.\" We drop the \\Manufacturing\" category, because it generates rm-level exposure mea- sures that are highly correlated with those generated by other, more focused categories. After combining categories and pruning, we have 934 terms in 38 categories. Table B.3 reports descriptive statistics for the resulting rm-level exposures for each categoryj. Some categories contain terms that appear in the RFtexts of relatively few rms (e.g., \\Gambling,\" 9% of rms), whereas others appear in the RFtexts of most rms (e.g., \\Web-Based Services,\" 68%). Cross- rm exposure variation within categories is typically large. 5.3 Applying the new exposure measures Table 4 reports abnormal return regressions on pandemic fallout days using the MNIR- generated exposure measures as explanatory variables. We t (3) to the same data as in Column (1) of Table 1 except for using 38 MNIR-generated exposure measures rather than the 36 measures derived from expert-curated dictionaries. As in Table 1, we express explanatory variables in standard deviation units. A rst key result is that the MNIR-generated exposures yield a large gain in t: The adjusted R2increases from 0.33 in Column (1) of Table 1 to 0.41 in Column (1) of Table 4. In other words, our 30MNIR-generated categories and measures outperform the dictionary approach, even when using about the same number of explanatory variables. A second key result is that our MNIR-based measures capture much of the overall t gain achieved by the full-blown MNIR implementation. When using the same rms and pandemic fallout days, the MNIR forward regression yields an adjusted R2value of 0.50. To be sure, that is a substantial t gain relative to Column (1) in Table 4. By itself, however, the forward regression has little interpretation value. Embedded within the su\u000ecient reduction projection that drives the strong t of the forward regression are more than 18,000 terms that appear in the RFcorpus and receive non-zero weight in the inverse regression. In contrast, Column (1) reports a regression based on 38 exposure measures and 934 terms. Moreover, each category involves a collection of related terms that, in most cases, o er ready interpretations. Table 4 o ers a rich account of how bad pandemic news drives the structure of rm-level abnormal returns. Exposures to \\Traditional Retail\" and \\Card Payments\" involve negative returns, while exposure to \\Ecommerce\" involves positive returns { in line with the pandemic-induced shift in consumer spending from traditional retail to online modes. Other results re ect major shifts in consumer spending across types of non-durable goods and services. For example, exposures to \\Foodstu s\" and \\Restau- rants\" generate positive and negative returns, respectively, in line with a shift from market to home production of meals. \\Video Games\" is associated with positive re- turns, while \\Gambling\" and \\Aircraft + Travel\" are associated with negative returns, re ecting a major shift across entertainment and recreation activities. Downstream demand shocks are also key drivers of return reactions to pandemic news. For example, exposures to \\Alternative Energy\" and \\Energy Infrastructure + Oil and Gas\" involve negative returns, while the opposite holds for exposures to the technology supply chain as captured by \\Raw Metals and Minerals,\" \\Electronic Com- ponents and Services.\" The magnitudes of the estimated coe\u000ecients on these exposure measures for intermediate goods and services are com- parable to the ones for categories that capture spending on nal consumption goods. 31Dependent Variable: Abn it(1) (2) Table 4: Regression Results Using MNIR-Generated Exposures, Pandemic Fallout Days Each column considers 38 MNIR-generated exposure measures for pandemic fallout dates. We also include log market cap and leverage. Additionally, columns 1 and 2 (3) consider 2-digit (4- digit) NAICS codes to introduce industry xed e ects and to cluster errors. For columns 2 and 3, we drop 4-digit NAICS codes with less than 5 companies. tstats are reported in parentheses; and, for presentation purposes, we omit the coe\u000ecients on exposures that are not signi cant at the 0.1 level.

As a benchmark, note that estimating MNIR with all terms achieves an adjusted R2of 0.502 in the analogue forward regression. 32Financial exposure categories also also important. \\Mortgages\" generates nega- tive returns, as do other property-related \\REITs\" and \\Residential Construction.\" Exposure to \\Financial Management\" is also associated with negative return reactions. In contrast, exposures to \\Banking + Deposits\" and \\Investment Funds\" yield positive return reactions. A plausible explanation is that bad news about the pandemic drove greater precautionary savings and more concern about managing portfolio risks among higher-income households. We can also produce a model-based explanation for any particular rm's return reactions by combining its exposure measures with the estimation results. Consider Plains All American Pipeline, which had an average daily abnormal return of -6.4% on pandemic fallout days as compared to -1.1% for the average rm. The Column (1) model in Table 4 predicts a daily abnormal return of -5.9% for Plains. The model attributes the company's sharply negative performance on pandemic fallout days to its heavy exposure to \\Energy Infrastructure + Oil and Gas,\" \\REITs,\" and \\Alternative Energy\" and its light exposure to categories associated with positive returns. Column (3) in Table 4 includes NAICS4 industry e ects in place of NAICS2 e ects. For comparison, column (2) reports results using NAICS2 e ects on the same sample as in column (3). Some exposure measures become insigni cant, but most remain signi cant and a few previously insigni cant ones become signi cant. The implication is that our MNIR-generated exposure measures are not simply a proxy for industry categories. Instead, they capture and explain important di erences in rm-level return reactions within narrowly de ned industries. In sum, bad COVID-19 news generates a wide array of positive and negative return reactions across rms. The richness of the RFcorpus enables us to uncover dozens of separate e ects that play a role in driving the structure of return reactions, including e ects that re ect demand shocks induced by social distancing and those that involve indirect exposures via supply-chain linkages. 335.4 Risk exposures and industries The strong explanatory power of our exposure measures in Table 4, even conditional on NAICS4 xed e ects, suggests that rm-level exposures vary considerably within and between industries. To develop this point, we examine the intra-industry distribution of rm-level exposures for four exposure categories, two with statistically signi cant positive coe\u000ecients in Table 4 and two with negative coe\u000ecients. We visualize these rm-level distributions as box plots in Figure 7. Two NAICS4 industries with high dispersion in exposures to \\Traditional Retail\" are, in fact, part of the retail sector: Health and Personal Care Stores and Automobile Dealers.13The other three industries with large dispersion in exposure to \\Traditional Retail\" sit upstream from the retail sector: Cut and Sew Apparel Manufacturing; Soap, Cleaning Compound, and Toilet Preparation Manufacturing; and Petroleum and Petroleum Products Merchant Wholesalers. This case illustrates how our exposure categories capture both direct and indirect e ects of shocks to a given sector, and how greatly the rm-level exposures di er within industries. Figure 7b shows that exposure to the \\Oil and Gas\" category varies across and within industries that extract fossil fuels, transport fuels, use fuels as intermediate inputs, and sell fuels. Four industries with high dispersion in exposures to \\Foodstu s\" manufacture or process food and drinks, while the other industry comprises merchant wholesalers who sell these products to downstream grocery and food stores. Finally, a heterogeneous set of industries are exposed to Web-Based Services. These include hardware manufactur- ers that build physical cloud infrastructure, software publishers that provide code to run that infrastructure, and rms that use the web to provide services to downstream consumers (e.g., cable programming and telecommunications). 13The rm in Health and Personal Care Stores with minimum (maximum) exposure is Rite Aid Corporation (Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance Inc.). The minimally and maximally exposed Au- tomobile Dealers are, respectively, Rush Enterprises and Asbury Automotive Group. 340255075100 Cut and Sew Apparel Manufacturing (3152)Health and Personal Care Stores (4461)Automobile Dealers (4411)Soap, Cleaning Compound, and Toilet Preparation Manufacturing (3256)Petroleum and Petroleum Products Merchant Wholesalers (4247) NAICS4 IndustryLevel of Risk Exposure(a)`Traditional Retail' Exposure Category 0250500750 Oil and Gas Extraction (2111)Petroleum and Petroleum Products Merchant Wholesalers (4247)Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas (4862)Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing (3241)Agriculture, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing (3331) NAICS4 IndustryLevel of Risk Exposure (b)`Oil and Gas' Exposure Category 050100150 Fruit and Vegetable Preserving and Specialty Food Manufacturing (3114)Beverage Manufacturing (3121)Grocery and Related Product Merchant Wholesalers (4244)Other Food Manufacturing (3119)Animal Slaughtering and Processing (3116) of Risk Exposure (c)`Foodstu s' Exposure Category 050100150200 Software Publishers (5112)Cable and Other Subscription Programming (5152)Other Telecommunications (5179)Computer and Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing (3341)Wired and Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (5173) NAICS4 IndustryLevel of Risk Exposure (d)`Web-Based Services' Exposure Category Figure 7: Intra-Industry Distributions of Firm-Level Risk Exposures For a selection of four targeted exposures, we compute the risk exposure distribution across rms in absolute values within NAICS4 industries. Each gure shows box plots for the ve industries for which the interquartile range of these distributions is highest. The upper (lower) whisker represents the largest (smallest) observation that is less (greater) than or equal to the third ( rst) quartile plus (minus) 1.5*IQR. Black dots represent outliers. 355.5 An Application to Super Tuesday To illustrate its exibility and power, we now apply our approach to explain and inter- pret rm-level equity returns in reaction to Super Tuesday. This application captures the impact of the attendant shift in expectations about future government policy due to changes in the likelihood of a Biden, Sanders or Trump Presidency, expectations about what policies Biden would pursue to secure the Democratic nomination, and expectations about the Trump campaign's policy agenda in response to the now-likely prospect of facing Biden in the general election contest. Table B.4 reports the RFterms most associated with positive and negative return reactions to Super Tuesday. Terms related to hotels and gambling (\\hotel proper- basin\") are among those highly associated with negative returns, while terms associated with real estate more broadly (\\tenants,\" \\reit,\" \\undeveloped land\") and healthcare (\\health insurance,\" \\medicare,\" associated with positive returns. Recall that \\reit\" and \\oil\" are in uential predictors of negative returns on pandemic fallout days. They remain highly in uential in explaining reactions to Super Tuesday but in the opposite direction, illustrating how we capture distinct rm-level return reactions to di erent types of shocks. These results also illustrate the power of text to disentan- gle countervailing e ects. Generic property terms predict positive return reactions to Super Tuesday, while terms relating to the hotels and gambling segment of the prop- erty market predict negative reactions. Perhaps not coincidentally, former President Trump has major business interests that involve hotels and gambling. Table B.5 reports rms for which MNIR yields the largest t gains relative to a no-text model. All ve rms with the largest negative predicted reactions are in the oil and gas sector. Terms like \\crude,\" \\re nery,\" \\o shore,\" and \\drilling\" are most responsible for driving these predictions. Two rms with large positive reactions facil- itate government-sponsored healthcare (eHealth and Centene Corp), two are involved in mining (Coeur Mining Inc and Gold Resource Corp), and one is an industrial prop- 36erty developer (Gri\u000en Industrial Realty). In each case, the terms associated with large positive returns relate naturally to the company's main business activity. Next, we select 47 seeds (listed in Table B.6) and, as before, use them to construct term sets that de ne exposure categories. We obtain 666 automatically generated terms and prune 215 of them, as set forth in appendix C.2. Note that a given seed need not yield the same term set for Super Tuesday as for pandemic fallout days, because the estimated MNIR models di er. For example, the \\ecommerce\" seed yields 23 terms on pandemic fallout dates but just 3 on Super Tuesday (before manual pruning), because few terms semantically related to e-commerce are associated with negative returns on Super Tuesday. Nevertheless, several seeds yield similar term sets for Super Tuesday and pandemic fallout days, e.g., \\travel,\" \\reit,\" and \\gaming.\" We also uncover many distinct exposure categories for Super Tuesday. These in- clude \\Drilling Activity\" and \\Fracking,\" which describe speci c fossil fuel extraction activities, in contrast to\\Energy Infrastructure\" and \\Oil and Gas.\" (Medicare, \\Waste Disposal.\" Another notable category is \\Financial Regulation,\" a concept also present in the baseline dictionaries and correlated with Super Tuesday return reactions in Ta- ble 1. By and large, our MNIR-generated exposure categories for Super Tuesday add detail and nuance to concepts like healthcare, energy, nance, and real estate present in the baseline dictionaries. In contrast, our MNIR-generated exposure categories for pandemic fallout days are often quite distinctive and absent from the baseline dictio- naries. Examples include categories for cloud computing, web services, and material inputs to the technology supply chain. 37Dependent Variable: Abn it(1) (2) ects Table 5: Regression Results Using MNIR-Generated Exposures, Super Tuesday Aftermath Each column considers 40 MNIR-generated exposure measures for Super Tuesday. We also include log market cap and leverage. Additionally, columns 1 and 2 (3) consider 2-digit (4-digit) NAICS codes to introduce industry xed e ects and to cluster errors. For columns 2 and 3, we drop 4-digit NAICS codes with less than 5 companies. tstats are reported in parentheses; and, for presentation purposes, we omit the coe\u000ecients on exposures that are not signi cant at the 0.1 level. As a benchmark, note that estimating MNIR with all terms achieves an adjusted R2of 0.349 in the analogue forward regression. Table 5 presents the abnormal returns regression for Super Tuesday based on the new exposure categories. We again nd a sizable t gain compared to a model that 38relies on the baseline dictionaries: the adjusted R2rises from 0.199 in Column (4) of Table 1 to 0.242 in Column (1) of Table 5, roughly one-third of the gain from using the full-blown MNIR model (0.349). Many exposure categories remain statistically signi cant after controlling for NAICS4 e ects, again showing that the RFtexts contain information that helps explain intra-industry variation in abnormal returns. 6 Longer-Term Outcomes We now investigate whether our text-based explanations for abnormal returns help predict rm-level surprises in corporate earnings in Q3 2020. Unlike abnormal returns, which can re ect revisions to cash ows and discount rates, earnings surprises pertain exclusively to new information about cash ows. Because earnings forecasts formed in 2020 are potentially contaminated by knowl- edge of COVID-19 and its e ects, we de ne surprises relative to forecasts made in 2019 Q4.14We obtain rm-level analyst forecasts of earnings per share (EPS) from I/B/E/S and express the earnings surprise for a given rm as a percentage of its pre-pandemic market value: 100(Realized Q3 2020 EPS minus average of analysts' forecast of Q3 2020 EPS)/(stock price per share on 15 November 2019).15We are able to construct this measure for 1,707 rms in our sample, and 1,507 after removing those in NAICS4 in- dustries with fewer than three rms and extreme outliers in the surprise distribution.16 The mean earnings surprise is -0.39 cents per dollar of share value, the standard devi- ation is 1.02, and the IQR is 0.7. As explanatory variables for the earnings surprises, we use the same NAICS4 and rm-level controls as before and the su\u000ecient reduction projections from our MNIR models t to (average) rm-level returns on the ve classes of jump dates.17Projections for the oil shock date and the scal stimulus dates are 14The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission publicly reported an outbreak of pneumonia of un- known cause on 31 December 2019. 15Since we do not know the precise date on which analysts submit their forecasts, we use the middle date of Q4 2019 for scaling. 16De ned as surprise values greater than the upper quartile value plus ve times the IQR and values lower than the lower quartile minus ve times the IQR. 17Thus, we are not tting MNIR models directly to the rm-level data on earnings surprises. While 39Dependent variable: Earnings Surprise (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) SRP Models Abnormal Returns Predict Earnings Surprises Each column models rm-level 2020 Q3 earnings surprises as a function of NAICS4 e ects, log market cap, and leverage. Columns (2)-(4) introduce the su\u000ecient re- duction projections (SRPs) from MNIR models t to rm-level returns on pandemic fallout days, monetary policy days, and Super Tuesday, respectively. Each SRP vari- able is scaled to have unit standard deviation. Column (5) introduces all three SRPs. In all cases, we cluster at the NAICS4 level when computing standard errors, and drop industries with fewer than three observations. highly correlated with the pandemic fallout projection, so we drop them. Table 6 reports the results. Each projection has statistically signi cant and eco- nomically material e ects on the earnings surprises. For example, according to Column (5), a unit standard deviation increase in the pandemic fallout projection value raises the earnings surprise by 0.313 percent of equity market value, conditional on the other explanatory variables, or nearly one half of the IQR of the surprise distribution. Con- sidered jointly, the projections raise the adjusted R2value by 42 percent (to 0.204) relative to a speci cation with NAICS4 e ects and rm-level controls. In short, our that would be an interesting exercise, it would not speak to whether our MNIR models for abnormal returns help predict future earnings surprises. 40text-based models for abnormal return reactions to common shocks in early 2020 also help predict earnings surprises later in the year. As a nal exercise, we ask whether the abnormal returns on jump days explained by our text-based models persist over longer horizons. Speci cally, we regress cumulative rm-level returns from 14 February 2020 through various end dates on the projection values and NAICS4 e ects. For end dates, we use 15 May, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December 2020. Table B.8 reports the results. For the sake of brevity, we focus on the su\u000ecient reduction projections obtained from our MNIR model t to the nine pandemic fallout days listed in Table 1. Regardless of end date, we nd that the pan- demic fallout projection is highly signi cant and quantitatively important. Raising the projection value by one standard deviation involves an increase in cumulative returns of 0.43, 0.45, 0.36, and 0.37 standard deviations, respectively, on the four end dates. Hence, the rm-level abnormal return reactions to bad pandemic news in the early wake of the pandemic explained by our text-based MNIR models persist through at least the end of 2020. Overall, these results for earnings surprises and cumulative returns allay concerns that our text-based exposure measures capture only short-lived e ects of no conse- quence for the real economy. 7 Concluding Remarks We exploit the Risk Factors texts in 10-K lings to investigate how market-moving shocks interact with prior risk exposures to drive the structure of rm-level equity returns. We focus on 17 trading days with large market-level moves from late February to the end of March 2020. These 17 days exhibit enormous dispersion in rm-level returns in reaction to news about COVID-19, monetary and scal policy, the Super Tuesday Democratic primary elections, and the oil price crash of 9 March. Our text-based models explain up to half the variation in abnormal rm-level re- turns on these days. Bad pandemic news triggers large negative return reactions for 41 rms with high exposures to travel, lodging, traditional retail, energy, aircraft pro- duction, residential construction, REITs and restaurants, among others. The same news triggers positive return reactions for rms with high exposures to drug trials, e-commerce, basic foodstu s, web-based services, video games, nancial management, and metals and minerals that feed into supply chains for semiconductors, electrical equipment and cloud computing. Many of these reactions reveal powerful e ects of downstream demand shocks on upstream suppliers. Examples include aircraft and en- ergy, harmed by the fall in travel demand, and positive return reactions for suppliers to rms that saw demand increases due to social distancing and the shift to working from home. Other market-moving news { such as monetary and scal policy actions or the Super Tuesday election outcome { generate quite di erent rm-level return reactions, which we also characterize using our text-based methods. The pandemic-induced return reactions we uncover foretell future corporate earn- ings surprises, as we show. They also presage other shifts in the economy. Examples include major job losses in the traditional retail sector, employment gains at online shopping and delivery rms, a persistent collapse in air travel, job cuts in aircraft pro- duction, numerous bankruptcies among oil and gas companies, a collapse of advertizing revenue in print media, and surging demand for cloud computing.18Our results also square with evidence that COVID-19 accelerated ongoing shifts to digital services and remote interactions across a whole host of activities. Indeed, the share of new U.S. patent applications that advance technologies to support video conferencing, telecom- muting, remote interactivity, and working from home more than doubled in the wake of the pandemic (Bloom et al., 2021). Managing the social and economic fallout of these shifts will present major policy changes for many years. In terms of methodology, we draw on two text-analytic approaches often seen as alternatives: expert-curated dictionary methods and supervised machine learning. By combining elements of both, we obtain rich models that (a) t better than models 18Barrero et al. (2020) discuss the rst four developments mentioned here and Financial Times (2020abc) discuss the others. 42based on expert-curated dictionaries, (b) uncover new, empirically relevant exposure categories missed by the curated dictionaries and, at the same time, (c) deliver inter- pretable patterns in the estimated structure of rm-level returns. This last feature pushes the supervised ML approach from prediction to interpretation. Our hybrid approach starts with Taddy's (2013, 2015) MNIR implementation of supervised ML. We use a tted MNIR model to identify in uential \\seed\" terms. For each seed, we build term sets based on similarity of linguistic context in the Risk Fac- tors texts and relationship to rm-level returns. These term sets e ectively de ne exposure categories, which we apply to the Risk Factors texts to quantify rm-level exposures. The resulting rm-level measures then serve as explanatory variables in return regressions that yield readily interpretable results. While retaining elements of a conventional dictionary-based approach, our hybrid approach leans lightly on domain expertise. It completely sidesteps the laborious construction of expert-curated dictio- naries. It also foregoes any reliance on external libraries, as in some NLP methods. As illustrated by our separate applications to pandemic fallout days and Super Tuesday, our hybrid approach is also exible and adaptable. We hope it will prove useful in many other applications. 43References Acemoglu, D., Akcigit, U., and Kerr, W. (2016). Networks and the Macroeconomy: An Empirical Exploration.

Hence, we keep stocks for which we have at least 125 daily return observations in 2019. We lose 28 rms in this step. \u000fWe also drop small caps: either because they are in the rst quartile of equity market value or because their share price is smaller than 5 dollars on February 21, 2020 (i.e. the last trading day before the stock market jump days we consider in this paper). Dropped small caps account for 2.5 percent of total equity market value in the sample. In this step, we remove 968 rms. \u000fWe discard 5 companies with no available NAICS2 code in our dataset. Finally, we keep only NAICS2 codes with at least 5 companies. We drop one rm in this last step. \u000fWe end up with an analysis sample of 2,155 stocks for 2,133 companies. A.2 Text preprocessing details Our feature space construction begins with 10Ks from 2010 to 2016 scraped from EDGAR for 3,580 unique rms. Some of these rms are not part of our nal sample, as explained above, we use them because they are potentially informative about the structure of language in the Risk Factors texts. 48We rst nd and replace meaningful phrases in the 10-K corpus with a single term in the feature space. For example, `We owe additional income tax' becomes `We owe additional income tax', where `income tax' is treated as an individual term. This ensures that the meaning conveyed by key phrases is retained in our analysis. These phrases come from multiple sources: 1. 433 phrases from the baseline dictionaries in Baker et al. (2019). 2. 3,803 phrases that correspond to named entities that appear more than 25 times in the corpus. We identify these entities with the named entity recognizer (NER) from the Stanford NLP group. The NER nds an additional 63 entities that also appear in the dictionaries, and so are redundant. 3. 9,649 additional multi-word expressions (MWE). To identify these, we rst tag all words in the corpus using a part-of-speech tagger from the Stanford NLP group, and then tabulate tag patterns likely to correspond to meaningful sequences Justeson and Katz (1995). Our nal set of MWE is the resulting trigrams that appear more than 150 times in the corpus, and bigrams that appear more than 500 times. This approach nds an additional 68 phrases also present in the dictionaries, and 265 phrases also present in named entities, and so are redundant.
