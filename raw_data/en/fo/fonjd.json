We live in large groups composed mostly of non-relatives. Evolutionists have proposed a number of explanations for this pattern, including cultural group selection and extensions of more general processes such as reciprocity,kin selection, and multi-level selection acting on genes. Evolutionary processes are consilient; they affect several different empirical domains, such as patterns of behavior and the proximal drivers of that behavior. In this target article, we sketch the evidence from ve domains that bear on the explanatory adequacy of cultural group selection and competing hypotheses to explain human cooperation. Does cultural transmission constitute an inheritance system that can evolve in a Darwinian fashion? Are the norms that underpin institutions among the cultural traits so transmitted? Do we observe suf cient variation at the level of groups of considerable size for group selection to be a plausible process? Do human groups compete, and do success and failure in competition depend upon cultural variation? Do we observe adaptations for cooperation in humans that most plausibly arose by cultural group selection? If the answer to one of these questions is \"no,\"then we must look to other hypotheses. We present evidence, including quantitative evidence, that the answer to all of the questions is \"yes\"and argue that we must take the cultural group selection hypothesis seriously. If culturally transmitted systems of rules (institutions) that limit individual deviance organize cooperation in human societies, then it is not clear that any extant alternative to cultural group selection can be a complete explanation. of 68 doi:10.1017/S0140525X1400106X , e30 \u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59PETER RICHERSON is Distinguished Professor Emeri- tus in the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at the University of California, Davis.

Introduction Few scholars doubt that the scale of cooperation found in contemporary human societies is unusual. We typicallylive in large, rule-bound, anonymous societies in whichthe mean genetic relatedness between members is low(Moffett 2013 ). Ethnographic evidence from hunter-gath- erer societies suggests that our Late Pleistocene ancestorsalready had many interactions with non-kin that were reg-ulated by systems of norms and institutions, even in socie-ties numbering only a few hundred to a few thousand (Hillet al. 2014 ). If that is the case, then there are two key evo- lutionary questions: (1) How did cooperation among non-kin evolve in small-scale societies in prehistoric times,and (2) how did small-scale societies evolve into much larger and more complex societies during the Holocene? We outline here the evidence that supports the hypothesisthat cultural group selection (CGS) was and still is an im- portant force in the evolution of human societies. Wecompare CGS to other evolutionary mechanisms thathave been proposed to account for human sociality. SeeBoehm ( ), and Leech ( 2013 ) for reviews of the various mechanisms pro- posed to date. Heretofore, the debate about the importance of CGS relative to competing explanations for human cooperationhas not been fully engaged. Some debates have focusedon narrow issues such as the interpretation of experimentalresults (Hagen & Hammerstein 2006 ) and the assumptions of mathematical models (Boyd et al. 2011 ; Lehmann et al. 2008 ). Reviews of evolutionarily plausible accounts of human cooperation often do not discuss CGS (e.g.,Sigmund 2007 ) or treat it as an unsupported conjecture or semantic error (e.g., West et al. 2007 ). Even the sympa- thetic commentator, E. A. Smith ( 2010 ), remarks that CGS is under-theorized and in need of much more empiricalanalysis. We provide a guide to the relevant theory andargue that the empirical evidence from a range ofdomains provides robust qualitative support for the pointthat CGS describes real and important processes inhuman social evolution. In many domains, the best evi-dence is quantitative. We cannot provide a precise quanti-tative account of the importance of CGS compared tocompeting (but generally not mutually exclusive) processesin the evolution of human cooperation. That is an ongoingproject with recent pioneering studies in critical areas. Wewill discuss the following hypotheses: 1.Cultural group selection . The CGS hypothesis is an updated version of the one that Darwin ( 1874 ) formulated inThe Descent of Man , the essentials of which are quoted in our epigraph (Richerson & Boyd 2010 ). Darwin lacked the modern distinction between genes and culture, but inDescent he argued that the organic differences between human groups were small, while the differences indurable cultural features -customs and traditions werethe terms he used -were large. He also noted that human groups -he uses the term tribe in the quote in our epigraph -compete. If this is the case, then group se- lection on cultural variation is an important force. Wesketch the CGS hypothesis in more detail in section 2. 2.Culture doesn 't evolve in the Darwinian sense . One critique of cultural evolutionary hypotheses generally is that transmitted culture, if it exists, lacks the propertiesto evolve in a Darwinian fashion at all, much less at thegroup level (Brown & Richerson 2014 ; Pinker 2012 ; Tooby 2014 ; Tooby & Cosmides 1992 ). The objection of some evolutionary biologists to CGS (e.g., West et al.2011 ) seems to turn on a similar argument. If culture is taken to be a proximate mechanism rather than an ultimatecause, and if it is true that proximate mechanisms cannotinfluence the ultimate evolutionary processes, then culture cannot play any active role in the evolutionaryprocess. For a general response to this argument, seeLaland et al. ( 2011 ). 3.Kin selection and reciprocity suf ce . Many alternatives to CGS argue that the familiar evolutionaryprocesses acting on genes -reciprocity and inclusive tness -w h i c hg e n e r a l l ye x p l a i nc o o p e r a t i o ni nn o n h u - mans, are also suf cient to explain the case of human co- operation (e.g., Alexander 1987 ). Henrich et al. ( 2003 ) provide a useful discussion of the most prominent ofthese. The issue here is not whether effects such as nepo-tism, reputation building, and other mechanisms of coop-eration supported by reciprocity and inclusive tness exist -no one doubts this -but whether they are suf cient to explain the large-scale cooperation in human societies.Some hypotheses hold that CGS became important fairlylate in human evolution and that a considerable amount ofcooperation evolved earlier due to kin selection and reci-procity (Tomasello et al. 2012 ). Campbell ( 1975 ) suggest- ed that CGS only became important once state-levelsocieties developed, about 5,000 years ago. In simpler so-cieties at least, individuals might bargain and negotiatetheir way to ef cient social equilibria, as some game the- orists argue (see Bowles & Gintis 2011 , Ch. 5 for a critical review). 4.Pleistocene social mechanisms mismatched in Holocene environments. A related alternative hypothesis holds that our innate social psychology evolved in the Pleis-tocene in societies that were so small that the familiarmechanisms mentioned previously could entirely accountfor their cooperative aspects. Subsequently, in the radicallydifferent environments of the Holocene, the cognitivemechanisms that evolved in the Pleistocene often causedpeople to behave in novel ways in environments thatwere outside the range of those in which the mechanismevolved. Some evolutionary psychologists argue thatlarge-scale cooperation may be a by-product of a Pleisto-cene cognitive mechanism expressed in much larger,more anonymous Holocene societies (Delton et al. 2011 ; Krasnow et al. 2012 ; Tooby & Cosmides 1989 ; but see Zef- ferman 2014a ). 5.A role for genetic group selection. Some alternate theories invoke genetic group selection (on groups largerthan those composed of close kin) as at least a partial expla-nation for human sociality (Rushton 1989 ; D. S. Wilson 2002 ; E. O. Wilson 2012 ). Several authors have imagined hybrid models in which culturally transmitted institutionsreduce within-group phenotypic variation to such lowRicherson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 3http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59levels that modest amounts of between-group genetic var- iation can come under selection (Boehm 1997 ; Bowles & Gintis 2011 , Ch. 7; D.S. Wilson & Knif n1999 ). We propose that CGS can exert selection on genes via cultural-ly transmitted cost and bene t schedules (coevolutionary social selection). Culture-led gene-culture coevolution could produce much the same result as group selection more directly on genes. 6.Trigger hypotheses . Many hypotheses regarding human origins invoke some key selection event deep inour evolutionary history that set us on a path that led tomodern human culture and societies. Proposals of thissort include: bipedality (Washburn 1959 ); intelligence (Pinker 2010 ); cooperative breeding (Burkart et al. 2009 ); cooperative hunting (Stanford 1999 ), language (Smith 2010 ); cooking (Wrangham 2009 ); and docility (Simon 1990 ). Such hypotheses are dif cult to test independently of the coevolutionary extension of the CGS hypothesis. Inliving hunter-gatherers, and other modern humans,culture is closely involved in all of these phenomena (Hillet al. 2009 ). The paleoanthropological record is remarkably hard to interpret with regard to the order in which thevarious components of modern human sociality evolvedand which components coevolved. Bipedal locomotionmay have been necessary, but it was not a suf cient trigger because bipedality evolved in the Australopithecinelineage well before the record contains evidence of anyadvance in cultural behavior over that in nonhuman apes.On the other hand, even the most innatist theories of lan-guage evolution imagine a culture-led gene-culture coevo-lutionary process driving language evolution (Pinker &Bloom 1990 ). Thus, we have little to say about hypotheses of this type. In sum, if CGS is an active process in human social evo- lution, then we should see evidence that: (1) culture acts asan inheritance system; (2) group-variable culturally trans-mitted social norms and institutions are among thedomains of culture so transmitted; and (3) success orfailure in intergroup competition is frequently caused by in- stitutional variation. As a result of these three features, we should also nd evidence of: (4) group-level functionality in cultures, particularly in their social norms and institutions.The CGS hypothesis is thus vulnerable to disproof inseveral empirical domains. Competing hypotheses arguethat cultural systems lack one or more of these features,or possess them to such a limited extent that the explana-tion for human sociality must depend in the main onother processes. 2. The cultural group selection hypothesis In this section, we characterize the CGS hypothesis. Three distinct CGS processes exist, united by being driven bygroup-level heritable cultural variation, but differing inthe mechanism of selection. Two of these forms aredriven by human choices -choices in part based on proso- cial emotions like Darwin 's sympathy and patriotism. Because prosocial impulses play such a large role in CGS,it is important to account for their evolution. In thesecond part of this section, we describe the \"tribal social in- stincts hypothesis, \"a modernization of Darwin 's proposal, which can, in principle, explain the evolution of prosocialemotions.Humans exhibit a wide variety of culturally transmitted organizational phenomena larger than, and differentfrom, those re flecting biological relatedness and close pair- wise partnerships. These include corporate kin groups, eth-nicities, nations, classes, castes, religions, clubs, nations,and empires. CGS is potentially acting on more than one of these groups simultaneously, leading many authors to speak of multi-level selection . The most ancient groups are the ethnolinguistic tribes into which simpler societiesare generally divided. As we discuss below, selection ontribes can account for the innate foundation of our socialpsychology via the process of gene-culture coevolution.The evolution of complex societies in the last ve millennia has generated a diverse array of social groups that can varyculturally, compete, and be subject to group selection. Wediscuss business rms and religions as examples. While modern nations and the subgroups of which they are com-posed differ in many ways from ancestral tribes, they reston the innate foundations that evolved from competitionbetween ethnolinguistic units (Richerson & Boyd 1999 ). Given their short history, selection on modern groups willnot have had a major impact on genes, but we argue thatit has been very important in the ongoing evolution ofcomplex societies. 2.1. How human culture facilitates CGS How do cultures generate the group-level variation thatCGS requires, and what sort of selective processes act onthat variation? In this section, we de ne the CGS hypothe- sis by reviewing the mechanisms that make cultural inher-itance and cultural evolution quite different from geneticevolution. The mechanisms that maintain intergroup variation are the following: 1.Accurate, rapid social learning. Human cognition includes adaptations for imitation and teaching that allowthe cumulative evolution of complex traits, includingnorms and institutions that regulate social behavior (Tom-asello 1999 ). See section 3. 2.Conformist social learning. If people tend to dif- ferentially copy locally common behaviors, the homogeniz-ing effect of migration will be reduced and groupdifferences will be maintained (Boyd & Richerson 1985 ). 3.Coordination payoffs. If the payoff to any strategy depends on the local frequency of its use, then even sub-populations in identical environments may reach differentstable equilibria over time. Frequency-dependent payoffsand multiple stable equilibria are probably very commonin human social institutions (Cooper 1999 ). 4.Punishment of deviant behaviors. Punishment of those who engage in uncommon behaviors can stabilize es-sentially any norm within a group, regardless of its otheradaptive consequences (Boyd & Richerson 1992b ). Since these norms will often be in fluenced by historical happen- stance, groups will often end up with different sets of morally enforced customs. Punishment is a strong force if the punishing is cheap to the punishers but costly to thepunished. 5.Strong prestige bias or one-to-many transmis- sion. If people learn disproportionately from those who are most prestigious or successful in their local population,then the \"effective size \"of the cultural population may beRicherson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 4 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59small and cultural drift will diversify populations (Cavalli- Sforza & Feldman 1981 ). 6.Symbolic markers of group boundaries. As groups differentiate, the importance of learning thelocally proper behaviors and customs becomes increasinglyimportant. If neutral marker traits correlate with behavioral norms that are dif cult to observe, then selection may favor attentiveness to these markers as reliable signals of whomto imitate (McElreath et al. 2003 ). Dialect is an example (see sect. 4.2). This contributes to group differentiationby facilitating in-group assortment and reducing thechances that migrants are imitated, especially in thoseregions where neighboring groups interact. 7.Institutional complexity that generates inertia and reduces borrowing. Institutions are often a complex array of norms organized to solve cooperation di-lemmas and navigate the intricacies of coordination (seesect. 4.3). The functioning of complex institutions ishighly dependent on tacit knowledge (Aoki 2001 ). Even in-group members may have an incomplete explicit under-standing of how an institution works, and the overall rulesdriving the institution may be distributed among thenorms of various specialized participants. This makes theinstitution quite opaque to out-groups, limiting the diffu-sion of institutions between societies. The high group-level variation between human groups sets the stage for the evolution of group-bene cial behav- iors. There are three distinct processes by which group-bene cial behavior can spread: 1.Natural selection. Groups exhibit variation in be- haviors that affect the rate at which they grow, producedaughter groups, overcome resource constraints, avoid in-ternal political con flict, succeed in war, and ultimately replace other groups. This provides a relatively slow formof selection for traits that contribute to group success(Soltis et al. 1995 ). 2.Selective imitation of successful groups. If people prefer to copy successful individuals, and if they have somecontact with out-group members, then members of lesssuccessful groups will sometimes copy members of moresuccessful groups. This favors the spread of group-bene - cial norms and institutions (Boyd & Richerson 2002 ). This force may be especially powerful if the new culturalcharacteristic is adopted by particularly in fluential group members who are more likely to be copied by others intheir group. 3.Selective migration between groups. Individuals in dysfunctional groups may migrate to another group ifthey observe that the other group more successfully main-tains behaviors that bene t all members (Boyd & Richerson 2009 ). The resulting diminution of unsuccessful groups may weaken their competitive ability and/or encourageleaders to adopt successful foreign norms, strengtheningthe two processes de ned previously. All three selective processes will tend to reduce group- level variation. Thus, the standing group-level variation is a balance between variation-creating and variation-reduc- ing forces. It is an empirical matter whether cultural evolu-tionary processes can maintain substantial between-groupvariation or whether, as is the case with genetic variation,appreciable group variation is hard to maintain. Seesection 4.1, particularly for a quantitative discussion ofthis issue.Throughout the remainder of this article, we will gener- ally use economic terms, such as \"cost,\"\"bene t,\"and \"success, \"to characterize the contribution of traits to CGS. Evolutionary biologists generally express such termsin the currency of genetic tness. Cultural evolution and gene-culture coevolution are considerably more complex. A cultural variant that attracts many imitators has a repro- ductive success which is not necessarily tied to biologicalreproduction. For example, prosocial leaders gain prestige,which may attract imitators not related genetically tothe leader. In the case of the three mechanisms of CGSand the mechanism of gene-culture coevolution, we canuse models to specify the costs, bene ts, and success of cultural variants in terms of changes in their frequency.Model- tting approaches have been used to estimate the strength of complex evolutionary forces in laboratory cul-tural evolution experiments (McElreath et al. 2008 ). So far, too few quantitative studies have been performed onCGS and competing processes to allow for much but qual-itative judgments. One of our purposes here is to make thecase that qualitative investigations already performedamply support the pursuit of more de nitive quantitative data. We will discuss the relatively small number of pio-neering quantitative studies of cultural evolution thathave been conducted to date (see, e.g., our Figure 1 in section 4.1 of this article). This work has demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative work on every phase of cultur-al evolution. For example, ambitious efforts are underwayto use historical and archaeological data to construct syn-thetic time series that will be suitable for quantitativemodel tting investigations (Collard et al. 2010 ; Turchin 2009 ; Turchin et al. 2012 ). Note that many cultural evolutionary processes generate cultural variation and cause evolution. CGS is only relevantto situations in which groups compete; it is not a completetheory of the evolution of cultural variation. 2.2. The tribal social instincts hypothesis If the three CGS processes described in the previoussection have operated over spans of time consistent withthe evolution of genes, then culture-led gene-culture co-evolution may have favored genes that encourage group ad-vantageous behavior. How did human culture become evolvable at the group level? Richerson and Boyd ( 1998 ) proposed a \"tribal social instincts \"hypothesis to account for the emergence of innate social predispositions that support the norm-and institution-bound social life of humans. Once humanscould culturally transmit elementary norms, simple moralcommunities would exist. Moral norms that evolvedunder the in fluence of CGS would exert social selection on human genes via mechanisms such as selective childneglect, mate choice, and punishment (Feldman &Laland 1996 ; Newson 2013 ). Perhaps the earliest cultural norms merely solidi ed the bonds of kinship and reciproc- ity that were evolving through participation in systems of cooperative breeding (Chapais 2008 ; Hrdy 2009 ). Infants younger than one year prefer puppets that are helpful toothers over those that are antisocial (Hamlin et al. 2011 ), suggesting that our social predispositions are partlyinnate. See section 4.2 for more evidence on this point. The complexity of technology that a group can maintain is a function of its size (Henrich 2004 ; Shennan 2001 ).Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 5http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59Docile individuals more inclined to conform to norms would nd it easier to enter larger more norm-bound groups and hence be able to acquire more sophisticatedtechnology (Simon 1990 ). A population of more docile in- dividuals could then permit the cultural evolution of slightlymore sophisticated and effective norms. This would allow groups to maintain more reliable cooperation and tools, which would, in turn, be favored by CGS acting on thisvariation. A recent quantitative estimate of rates of cultural evolu- tion using a large body of historical and archaeologicaldata showed that it evolves considerably faster than genes(Perreault 2012 ). Cultural evolution will thus tend to be the leading process, and genetic evolution the laggingprocess, in gene-culture coevolution. Over repeatedrounds of such coevolution, stretching back perhapsseveral hundred thousand years, our Pleistocene ancestorscame to have institutionalized social systems with (if ethno-graphic analogs are reliable) complex sets of linked normsorganizing tribal societies of a few hundred to a few thou-sand people (Hill et al. 2014 ). At some point, language became suf ciently rich that complex norms could be ex- plained to children, and participants could make promises,negotiate con flicts, and discuss institutional innovations (see sect. 6.1). Several hypotheses compete with this coevolutionary account. Ayala ( 2010 ) argues that natural selection acted directly on human cognitive capacities to the point thatall of the innate underpinnings necessary for the mainte-nance of norms and institutions were in place before thecultural transmission of them was important. Other ac-counts root human sociality in genetically evolved skillsfor social exchange, with no important role for cultural evo-lution (Tooby & Cosmides 1992 ). Evidence currently exists that supports the hypothesis of culture-led gene-culture coevolution for a few simplegenetic traits whose function is well known, but unfortu-nately not yet for genes related to behavior. The best under-stood examples of culture-led gene-culture coevolution are adult lactase persistence (Durham 1991 ) and the hemoglo- bin polymorphisms that confer resistance to malaria (Allison1964 ). Recent molecular evidence suggests that the genes associated with these and other phenotypic changes sweptto appreciable frequencies in the Holocene, as agriculturaldiets exerted selective pressures on digestive physiology(Itan et al. 2009 ; Tishkoff et al. 2007 ) and human popula- tions became dense enough to carry epidemic diseases(Wolfe et al. 2007 ). The dramatic changes of modern envi- ronments are resulting in detectable selection on genesrelated to health and fertility (Byars et al. 2010 ; Kohler et al. 1999 ). Genome-wide scans for genes under selection and comparative studies on chimpanzee -human differenc- es detect strong recent selection at a large number of lociaffecting genes that are expressed in the nervous systemand in hormone producing glands. These are candidatesto test the tribal social instincts hypothesis and its competi-tors, but the speci c functions of the selected alleles are as yet unknown (Laland et al. 2010 ; Ross & Richerson 2014 ). For example, if genes for docility were selected early inthe hominin lineage before we have evidence for sophisti-cated culture, they are less likely to have been a productof culture-led gene-culture coevolution than if theyevolved in the last 150,000 years as culture increased tomodern levels of sophistication.Several possible cases of genes related to behavior coming under culture-induced selection in the Holocenehave been proposed. Cochran and Harpending ( 2009 ) suggest that the rise of modern urban occupations havefavored genes for higher intelligence in some populations.Chiao and Blizinsky ( 2010 ) argue that neural processing of social status cues differs between more and less hierar- chical societies. The genetic mechanism proposed as acause of such differences is variation in a serotonin trans-porter gene. Genomic tools promise to substantially improve our ability to test the tribal social instincts hypothesis by allow-ing us to estimate the dates at which major selective eventsoccurred (Richerson et al. 2010 ). Ongoing advances in whole genome sequencing will provide much larger andhigher resolution samples of genomes. Improvements instatistical and modeling techniques promise to improvethe resolution for detecting signatures of selection, andfor discovering their selective consequences more easily(Pritchard et al. 2010 ). Over the next decade, we can expect a flood of new data that can be used to test hypoth- eses related to gene-culture coevolution. 3. Culture acts as an inheritance system Two quite distinct lines of evidence show that human culture acts as an inheritance system. First, evidencefrom developmental studies shows how a cognitivesystem for imitation arises in the rst 12 months of life and dovetails with adult behaviors that support children 's social learning. Other apes have a much more rudimentarysocial learning system. Second, historical evidence showsthat human culture exhibits a phylogenetic pattern ofdescent with modi cation in which ancestral commonalities can be traced back thousands of years. Together, these linesof evidence cast strong doubt on the idea that most humanbehavioral differences have arisen via an extreme version ofthe\"evoked culture \"hypothesis (Tooby & Cosmides 1992 ). By\"evoked culture, \"these authors mean that human minds have a universal psychological architecture, selected inPleistocene environments, which allows for the expressionof phenotypic differences during development in variousevolutionarily relevant domains such as social exchangeand mate choice. It is also dif cult to see how the develop- mental and historical evidence can be reconciled with anextreme version of the later improvisational intelligence hy- pothesis of Cosmides and Tooby ( 2001 ). Individual humans might invent complex adaptations on the spot as needed,with little or no need to depend on cultural inherited tradi-tions. If this were so, children would have little need toacquire complex adaptations with a system adapted forhigh- delity imitation. Nor would we observe deep phylo- genetic patterns in comparative and historical data; highrates of individual improvisational innovation wouldrapidly erase any historical signal due to culture transmis-sion by accurate imitation. This is not to defend a blank slate hypothesis. Gene-based cognitive constraints on cul- tural evolution are surely many. Nor do we mean toimply that humans are not highly intelligent. Nor are weeven sure that anyone defends extreme versions of theevoked culture or improvisational intelligence hypotheses.It is easy to imagine that a phenomenon like religion isco-produced by genetically inherited cognitive biases andRicherson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 6 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59the cultural transmission of speci c religious doctrines (Gervais et al. 2011 ), and the great speed of cultural relative to genetic evolution no doubt owes much to our capacityfor foresightful innovation (Perreault 2012 ). 3.1. A cognitive system for accurate, voluminous cultural transmission Children have powerful cognitive systems evolved to acquire quite complex cultural knowledge from theirelders. Adults and knowledgeable children also appear tobe adapted to behave in ways that scaffold the learning ofna\u00efve children (Csibra & Gergely 2011 ; Dean et al. 2012 ; Kline 2015 ). The transmission of complex cultural informa- tion and its cumulative evolution requires accurate imita-tion (Tennie et al. 2009 ). Nonhuman social learners tested so far lack the skills necessary to acquire a large rep-ertoire of complex skills, and there are so far no reports ofnonhumans having acquired complex traits (traits com-posed of more than two or three separate innovations) bysocial learning. Human children routinely learn conceptswith help from knowledgeable others that qualitativelytranscend innate intuitions (Carey 2009 ). In the 1970s and 1980s, a highly innatist hypothesis for language learn- ing was a major part of the cognitive revolution (Pinker 1994 ). It has failed to account, however, for the wide diver- sity of syntactic devices comparative linguists have sincediscovered (e.g., Evans & Levinson 2009 ; Newmeyer, 2004 ). Most grammatical constructions appear to be cultur- al features underpinned only indirectly by rather generalcognitive features (e.g., Hurford 2011 ). Research over the last two decades has produced a fairly detailed picture ofhow human imitation develops over the rst 12 months of life (Carey 2009 ; Tomasello et al. 2005 ) and how older individuals support the imitative efforts of children(Csibra & Gergely 2011 ). The same basic system seems to operate across all domains of culture (Harris 2012 ). Human social learning contrasts sharply with that of chim- panzees and other nonhuman animals. Chimpanzee sociallearning focuses primarily on goal-related behaviors, such asretrieving food. In comparative studies with human children,chimpanzees tended to imitate only the behaviors necessary toreach a goal, while children diligently imitated all of an adult 's behaviors whether or not they directly resulted in reaching atangible goal (Whiten et al. 2009 ). If adults suggest that it is important, children will replicate adult actions in ritualisticdetail (Herrmann et al. 2013 ). This nding initially seems counterintuitive -humans appear to unnecessarily \"over- imitate, \"while chimpanzees seem better able to boil down a stream of actions to only the necessary, goal-related behaviors.However, over-imitation is probably an essential adaptationfor building a repertoire of elementary skills and maneuversthat will eventually be incorporated into complex crafts andsocial institutions (Harris 2012 ). Many cultural adaptations are so complex that the functional signi cance of many elements of them is opaque to learners and often to accomplished prac-titioners as well. Carefully following demonstrated recipes preserves functionality, albeit at some cost of replicating non-functional elements. Thus, studies of child development strongly suggest that human social learning does accurately transmit cultural var- iants over a wide range of design space in many domains(Carey 2009 ). In section 4.2, we address the issue of the cultural transmission of social norms.Many experimental studies of human social learning have been conducted on adults, mostly student volunteers(Kempe & Mesoudi 2014 ). Individuals use a variety of strategies to acquire social information, tending to favorsuccess-based strategies when such information is availableto them; conformist strategies are typically employed when payoff-based information is unavailable or uninformative (Molleman et al. 2014 ). 3.2. Descent with modi cation Darwinian evolutionary processes shape adaptations incre- mentally. Marginal change occurs over each small time stepin history, followed by reasonably faithful transmission andfurther marginal changes. Over many such time steps, theevolving system can, but need not necessarily, change dra-matically. Often successful lineages split, often repeatedly,to form many sister groups. The Romance language societiesare an example. A necessary but not suf cient test of the CGS hypothesis is whether the social systems of human societiesfollow a phylogenetic pattern, the way genes do, thus demon-strating descent with modi cation. If the transformational processes operating in human history were as strong as theimprovisational intelligence hypothesis (Cosmides & Tooby 2001 ;P i n k e r 2010 ) holds, then humans would routinely switch such things as their political organization quiterapidly and in large jumps, thus not leaving a phylogeneticpattern. Similarly, the evoked culture hypothesis holds thathuman behavioral variation is based on a pan-humanevolved psychology that is expressed in different ways in dif-ferent environments (Tooby & Cosmides 1992 ). If this hy- were true, phylogenetic patterns would also beweak or undetectable; variation would re flect current ecology, not cultural history. A pattern of descent with mod-ication by itself does not test the CGS process against com- peting evolutionary processes acting at lower levels oforganization than groups; it only establishes the action of anevolutionary rather than a non-evolutionary process. Historical linguists established that languages evolved by descent with modi cation before Darwin and his contem- poraries began to apply the idea to biological evolution(M\u00fcller 1862 ). Recently, phylogenetic methods, originally borrowed from biology, have been applied to detectingdescent-with-modi cation patterns in cultural data (Mace & Jordan 2011 ). These methods have reached a high degree of sophistication (e.g., Bouckaert et al. 2012 ). Lan- guage phylogenies appear to be a reasonable proxy for pop-ulation movements, often matching phylogenetic patternsbased on genes reasonably well (Cavalli-Sforza et al.1988 ), albeit not perfectly. The phylogenies of several large language families have been investigated, including Bantu (Holden 2002 ), Austro- nesian (Gray et al. 2009 Tupi (Walker et al. 2012 ), and Indo-European (Bouckaert et al. 2012 ). The Walker et al. study is notable for quantitatively estimating rates evolutionin several Tupi cultural domains (usually less than ve tran- sitions in 10 millennia). From the correspondence of lin- guistic time-depth estimates and archaeological dates, each of these language families appears to constitute a cul-tural adaptive radiation based upon agricultural subsistenceand associated social-organizational features. These innova-tions allowed their speakers to expand at the expense ofhunter-gatherers in the Early and Middle Holocene. Inthe case of the eastern Austronesians, expansion wasRicherson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 7http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59partly to remote, previously uninhabited oceanic islands. Early farmers in Europe were clearly the result of ademic expansion (Haak et al. 2010 ). Currie and Mace (2009 ) found that the area over which a language is spoken is more closely related to its political complexitythan to any other variable tested, consistent with the hy- pothesis that CGS on social organization features correlat- ed with language played an important role in the creation ofpatterns of linguistic diversity. Historically attested expan-sions of empires, typically accomplished by a mixture ofmilitary conquest, assimilation of conquered peoples, andmigration into the more prosperous dominant society,appear to exhibit all three CGS processes (Turchin 2006 ). Language trees can be used as a foundation for studying other kinds of cultural evolution. Such studies show thatfeatures of social organization often include strong phyloge-netic signals that are correlated with the linguistic signal.Again, this is a necessary but not suf cient condition for CGS to have been an important process. Guglielminoet al. ( 1995 ) studied 47 cultural traits, many of them related to social organization, in 277 African societies.They used correlation with language groups to estimate\"vertical \"(within-culture) transmission, similarity to neigh- boring groups to estimate \"horizontal \"diffusion from linguistically unrelated groups, and correlation with vegeta-tion type to infer the effects of adaptation to local environ-ments. They detected a strong effect of vertical inheritanceof cultural traits related to family and kinship and theeconomy, and a medium vertical effect on traits relatedto social strati cation and house type. The effect of hori- zontal diffusion was high on the division of labor by sexand house type. The direct effect of environments wasstrongest on economy-related traits and medium to lowon other traits. In other words, the effect of either verticalor horizontal transmission was strong on all traits examined.Currie et al. ( 2010 ) used the rise and fall of political com- plexity in Austronesian societies to directly test thedescent-with-modi cation hypothesis. They found that in the best- tting model, political complexity increased and decreased in incremental steps. The second-best- tting model allowed for decreases (but not increases) in com-plexity to skip intermediate steps. As more historical and archaeological data are converted to time series suitable for quantitative analysis, tests of descentwith modi cation will become more common and more precise (Turchin 2008 ). It should also be possible to estimate the parameters of mechanistic evolutionary models to suchdata to more directly test the CGS hypothesis and its compet-itors. See Bouckaert et al. ( 2012 )f o ras i m p l ee x a m p l e .O f particular interest will be investigations that trace the evolu-tion of Roman law and similar institutions, as they were trans-mitted both vertically and horizontally. Certainly, noevidence carefully examined to date suggests that non-evolu-tionary patterns dominate the archaeological and historicalrecord, as would be suggested by strong versions of theevoked culture and improvisational intelligence hypotheses. 4. Culture exhibits group-level variation If CGS processes are to operate on cultural variation, then we must document appreciable variation at the level of groups.Group selection on genes is generally implausible becausemigration between groups prevents substantial geneticvariation from arising in groups larger than those composed of close kin. In section 2.1 we reviewed the mechanisms bywhich cultural systems can preserve much more variationbetween groups of unrelated or distantly related individualsthan can genetic inheritance. Here we review the evidencethat between-group cultural variation is large enough to support group selection and that the facility with which chil- dren learn the norms of their own group shows how the cul-tural inheritance system maintains CGS relevant variation. 4.1. Quantitative evidence of cultural differences between groups The more groups differ, the more effective CGS is likely to be. The Price equation, a general depiction of selection op-erating on multiple levels, can be re-arranged to express therequired conditions for a group-bene cial trait to be favored by selection in the face of individual-level selectionagainst the trait (Bell et al. 2009 ; Bowles 2006 ): Group Benefit Individual Cost.1FST FST(1) where FSTis the fraction of the total variance that is between groups. If groups do not differ at all for sometrait, then F ST= 0, and if the groups have nothing in common, then FST= 1. Developed to measure inbreeding and genetic differences between populations, FSTcan also be used to measure cultural differences. Equation(1) says that traits will be favored if they have zero individ-ual costs and positive group bene ts. Traits with some det- rimental individual-level effect on reproduction and/orsurvival can also be favored if group bene ts are suf ciently large to satisfy the inequality. Figure 1 describes the level of between-group variation required and plots the relation-ship between the minimum required bene t-to-cost ratio and the level of cultural differences represented in Equa-tion (1). Note that the scope for group selection is sensitiveto changes in low values of F ST, because the minimum con- dition declines geometrically with a linear increase in FST. This relationship suggests that evolutionary forces thatcreate relatively small differences between similar groups Figure 1. The scope for group selection. The curve is the minimum variation required for a group-bene cial trait to be favored by natural selection as a function of the level of cultural differences between groups ( FST). The points are cultural FST measurements across several kinds of group identities. For details, see the appendix.Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 8 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59can provide some scope for group selection in cases where group bene ts are high relative to costs. Aside from a few cases (e.g., Edgerton 1971), computing cul- tural FSTfrom ethnographic data is not possible because most ethnographers studying simple societies report only normativebehavior and neglect individual variation. Ethnographers and historians tacitly assume that individual variation for normative behaviors is typically small within groups, is large betweengroups, and grows larger with time in most lineages. If this iscorrect, the scope for CGS is large. To test the assumption,we used publically available datasets to measure variation innormative beliefs and behaviors within and between contem-porary populations. These dat a capture within- and between- group differences at various scales, from the national level tosmall political groups within larger communities. We calculated the cultural F STof a wide range of neigh- boring groups for a wide range of beliefs and behaviors(Fig. 1 ) using data from responses to international and state-level surveys, such as the World Values Survey, theAfroBarometer, the Public Policy Institute of Californiastatewide surveys, the Scottish Health Survey, and theAnwar Sadat Chair Arab Public Opinion Surveys, amongmany others. Together, these datasets provide a compre-hensive report of opinions and behaviors in group-level or-ganizations that are important in human societies: political,religious, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic identities.Some measurements are based on responses to one or twoquestions in a survey, analogous to one or two loci for agenetic F ST. Others are based on many questions and thus re flect broader level differences between groups. All measurements select questions that relate to a particulartheme relevant to group performance, such as attitudestoward immigration, a state-controlled economy, or theadoption of strict religious codes. Details can be found inthe table in the appendix of this article. Consistent with the hypothesis that individual variation for many normative beliefs and behaviors is small withingroups and large between groups, we nd large between- group differences among all groups of all scales ( Fig. 1 ). Among small political or ethnic groups, nations, and reli- gious majorities, we consistently report F STvalues greater than 0.01, with some traits showing FSTscores above 0.6. These values are important, as small increasesin cultural F STbeyond 0.01 increase the possibility for CGS dramatically. Our data reach well into the plateau ofthe L-shaped region of the group selection condition. The large cultural differences measured in this analysis suggest a wide scope for CGS. Our average measurementsof cultural F STplace the group-bene t-to-cost requirement well within range of some important cultural behaviors. Asdescribed in section 5 further on in this article, some culturalvariants provide a distinct advantage over other groups, out-weighing the individual costs of implementation. Bell et al.(2009 ) compared cultural F STfrom the World Values Survey with genetic FSTfrom Cavalli-Sforza et al. 's(1994 ) classic study. For neighboring groups that might actuallycompete, cultural F STis approximately an order of magnitude larger that genetic FST. These data suggest that the scope for CGS is substantially higher than for genetic group selection. 4.2. The transmission of social norms Social norms are among the cultural traits that childrenreadily acquire from adults and other children. Youngchildren are strikingly in flexible with social norms and rules, resulting in young moral absolutists (Levy et al.1995 ). Human children are also motivated to engage with others to pursue a shared goal without any reward,apart from the enjoyment o f engaging with another person socially (Tomasello & Carpenter 2007 ). For example, children as young as 14 months will readily provide instrumental help to an adult, and children of18 months will help and cooperate with unfamiliaradults. Chimpanzees 'abilities in this regard are more limited (Warneken & Tomasello 2009 ). Attempts to raise chimpanzee infants as if they were children are un- successful because young chimpanzees rather quicklymature into independent individuals that are not very re-sponsive to being taught social norms, much less adoptingthem spontaneously (e.g., Hayes 1951 ). Not all potential providers of social learning are equal. Even very young children prefer teachers andsocial partners who belong to their own social group.For example, preschool children preferred to learnboth linguistic and non-linguistic information from indi-viduals who spoke with the same accent as themselves(Kinzler et al. 2011 ), and 12-month-olds preferentially copy the food selection choices of adult native speakersof their own language (Shutts et al. 2009 ). The effects of out-group discrimination and in-group preference basedupon cultural categories like race are evident as early as3 years of age, when children begin to implicitly associ-ate same-race faces with positive facial expressions anddifferent-race faces with negative facial expressions(Hugenberg & Bodenhausen 2004 ). Children show adult levels of racial in-group bias by age 6 (Dunhamet al. 2008 ), although language difference seems to be a more intuitively salient marker than differences inskin color (Kinzler et al. 2009 ). B yt h et i m ep e o p l ea r ea d u l t s ,m u c he x p e r i m e n t a l work by social identity theorists shows that, in manysocial situations, individuals 'behavior is substantially in- fluenced by their the question \"who am I? \"The accurate imitation of cultural variation, especially group identities andsocial norms, is the basis for heritable cultural variationbetween groups upon which CGS can act. Social learningbiases, such as those described previously, act as ageneral force adapting culture to local environments.They tend to preserve locally successful social behaviorsand reduce the diffusion of cultural variation from onesocial group to another (see sects. 2.1 and 6.1). Identi - c a t i o nw i t hag r o u ps o m e t i m e sr e s u l t si nd e r o g a t i o no fother groups. Attitudes toward out-groups are certainlynot invariably invidious, however, contrary to some the-ories of ethnocentrism (Brewer 2007 ). Norm transmission has not been extensively studied in adults or undergraduate volunteers. However, early exper-iments showed a strong conformity effect (Jacobs & Camp-bell 1961 ), and rather rm socialization pressure with normative content is observed in some experiments(Baum et al. 2004 ;2012 ). Insko et al. ( 1983 ) demonstrated the evolution of institutions in a multi-generation experi-ment designed to mimic the origin of states. Effersonet al. ( 2008 ) showed experimentally that symbolic markers and in-group favoritism coevolve. Derex et al.(2014 ) showed that cultural transmission increasesRicherson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 9http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59substantially in between-group competition compared to within-group competition treatments. 4.3. Institutions are group-level cultural traits Scott ( 2001 , p. 48) provides a formal de nition of institu- tions: \"Institutions are social structures that have attained a high degree of resilience. [They] are composed of cultur-al-cognitive, normative, and regulative elements that, to-gether with associated activities and resources, providestability and meaning to social life. \"Institutions are impor- tant because they create and maintain variation betweengroups while simultaneously damping down variationamong individuals within groups. Institutions only functionwhen large numbers of people conform to them. Institu-tional economists often characterize institutions as equilib-rium solutions to social games that include rewards andpunishments that act to induce individual conformity tothe institution 's norms (Aoki 2001 ; Greif 2006 ). As a system of commonly accepted norms, they are a propertyof a group and often vary qualitatively from group togroup. Institutions are probably an ancient feature ofhuman social life, ancient enough to have generated the co-evolution of genes related to social behavior. The social life of living hunter-gatherers is certainly heavily institutional- ized (Hill et al. 2009 ). Game theory tells us that in repeated games without xed end points, the number of equilibria multiplies inordi- nately. This is easiest to see in the case of institutions in-volving moralistic punishment. If punishing is suf ciently cheap for punishers and suf ciently costly to the punished, punishment can stabilize any behavior (Boyd & Richerson1992b ). The empirical literature on village-scale commons management is particularly well developed and shows thatthe institutional diversity predicted by theory is amply man-ifest on the ground (Ostrom 2005 ). Similarly, ethnographers have documented ample institutional diversity betweensmall-scale societies that are our closest living approxima-tions to Late Pleistocene societies (e.g., Jorgensen 1980 ). Modern institutions vary substantially Henrich al. ( 2004 have systematically investigated cross-cultural variation using e xperimental games, including dictator, ultimatum, third-party punishment, and publicgoods games. These studies sugge st that institutional variation creates substantial differences in behavior. For example,Paciotti et al. ( 2005 ) conducted ultimatum game experiments in a Tanzanian village with two ethnic groups. The Sukuma,who are an expanding population of agro-pastoral colonizers,were found to have one of the highest average offers in the ul-timatum game ever measured. The Pimbwe, in contrast, madequite low offers. Interestingly, the Sukuma have a unique,elaborate institution of village governance, which the Pimbwelack, and the Sukuma organize the provision of public goodsmuch more effectively than the Pimbwe. Herrmann et al. ( 2008 ) compared the behavior of partic- ipants in public goods game experiments in 16 diverse soci- eties. Participants were given the opportunity to punish other members of their group. Groups from societies thatachieved high rates of cooperation over the 10 rounds ofthe game had high rates of punishment of non-contributors.However, in some societies, participants sanctioned highcontributors as well as low contributors. In such societies,rates of cooperation in the games were low. The authorsalso compared the 16 societies by using responses to the World Values Survey to construct indices of civic coopera-tion and rule of law. They found that societies where exper-iment participants used punishment to promote cooperationalso scored higher on these indices than societies in whichsome experimental participants punished cooperators. In section 2.1, we outlined how various mechanisms can generate and maintain between-group variation in the faceof migration. One important institutional mechanism withsubstantial empirical support is the marking of groupmembers through differences in dialect, dress, religion,and similar symbols. These markings are often readily ob-served and hard-to-fake symbols (e.g., Iannaccone 1994 ) that are emotionally salient to their bearers. Symbolicmarkers thus serve to identify members of distinct socialgroups and subgroups and to de ne who is and who is not entitled to bene ts from the activities of the organization. Institutions from one group are often quite dif cult for other groups to copy. The tendency of cultural items todiffuse between groups is favored by \"observability \"and\"tri- alability \"(Rogers & Shoemaker 1971 ). The institutions of another society are often hard to observe because outsiderscan seldom see the entire system of rules working together.Institutions are hard to try out, because for an institution tobe effective, some critical mass of group members has toadopt its rules. Considerable collective decision-making andlearning effort must be expended to integrate a novel institu-tion with the other institutions of the adopting society. Greif 's (2006 ) study of the evolution of early modern Mediterranean trading systems notes that institutional evolution occurs whenongoing changes destabilize an equilibrium previously regu-lated by an institution. Evolution then takes the form of a col-lective, culturally local search for a replacement institution.For example, the Genoese trading system was long regulatedby personal reputations. As the Genoese traders grewwealthy, reputation monitoring became too time-consumingto mesh with the increasing management responsibilities oftraders. Eventually they settled on a familiar formal legalsystem modeled on Roman law as preserved by the Church in the form of canon law. If culturally transmitted institutions had a major coevolu- tionary impact on the innate components of our social psy-chology (see sect. 2.2), then for some part of ourevolutionary history humans must have lived in institutionallystructured groups of a few hundred to several thousand indi-viduals that were symbolically marked and shared a commonidentity. Some authors argue that institutions only arose inthe Holocene (Runciman 2005 ), although archaeological from living foragers sug- gests that tribal-scale societies were common in thePleistocene. Even the Shoshone, often used as an exampleof the simplest sort of family-band society (Steward 1955 ), had supra-familial institutions involving upwards of 15 sepa-rate families to cooperatively hunt in winter camps and asystem for incorporating stranger families into these camps(Murphy & Murphy 1986 ); because of the high mobility of families, winter camps regularly incorporated co-ethnicstrangers. The Ju/ 'hoansi (!Kung), another primarily family- band society, frequently organize at the camp- and region-al-level when drought forces them to aggregate at permanentwater holes (Lee 1972 ). In 32 present-day foraging societies, Hill et al. ( 2011 ) found evidence of frequent inter-band rela- tions, low group genetic relatedness of co-residents within aband, and substantial interaction networks consisting ofRicherson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 10 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59unrelated individuals, all structured by institutions that differ from society to society. Even \"acephalous \"societies (those lacking formal leadership roles) use egalitarian institutionsto create societies with quite large-scale activities (Mathew&B o y d 2011 ). See section 5.1. How similar modern foragers are to Pleistocene foragers is dif cult to say with certainty. However, a reasonable as- sumption is that Late Pleistocene foragers exhibited arange of institutional complexity comparable to modern-day foragers. Archaeological data suggest that during theMiddle Paleolithic to Upper Paleolithic transition, about45 k.y.a, coherent cultural groups with stylistically differenttechnology moving about the Western Eurasian land-scape (Tostevin 2013 ). African evidence suggests that human use of symbolic markers goes back to about 164k.y.a (Marean 2010 ). CGS could well have been an active process as far back as symbolic marking is evident. The strategies used to formulate tribal institutions are widely applied to modern organizations such as churches,villages, neighborhoods, clubs, business organizations, andbureaucracies. For example, class and regional variationsare usually marked by linguistic differences (Labov 2001 ). These institutional differences among groups in turn facil-itate CGS via any of the three processes identi ed in section 2.1. The increase in institutional size and complex-ity in many societies in the Holocene is striking, but the ev-idence does suggest that the organization of anonymoussocieties using institutions has roots in the Pleistocene. A theoretically signi cant set of institutions are those that regulate family life and small-scale partnerships. Mathewet al. ( 2013 ) note that humans routinely engage in a broader set of small-scale cooperative activities than doour primate relatives, and they argue that institutionalizedthird-party rewards and punishments often regulate suchactivities. Marriage and kinship are examples. Almost allcultures have one or a small number of standard, legitimatemarriage contracts. Mating according to such a contractconfers social bene ts of the cooperative breeding system on the couple, and mating outside it is often signi cantly sanctioned. Kinship institutions specify the responsibilities of family members toward each other. Dispute resolution isan example of the institutionalization of small-scale reci-procity. Many societies have such institutions of varyingdegrees of formality (Nader 1969 ). If human cooperation could rest entirely on innate adaptations for kin cooperationand reciprocity, then why should these intimate relation-ships require institutional support? More likely, institution-al support is required if people are to enjoy the bene ts of highly cooperative interactions even in small social units.Marriage is a credible signal of commitment, for example,because of institutionalized third-party enforcement.Large groups will bene t from maintaining institutions that encourage their members to cooperate at the level ofsmall groups or families to the extent cooperation at suchscales is important economically and to the quality ofchild rearing. For the case of marriage, see Henrich et al.(2012b ); for dispute resolution, see Gambetta ( 1993 ). 5. Social groups in competition Here we consider examples of group competition in modern humans through the three processes outlined insection 2.1: selective borrowing between groups, migrationof individuals between groups, and selective extinction and proliferation of groups. This evidence suggests that CGSoccurs wherever signi cant cultural variation exists between neighboring and competing groups. 5.1. Warfare The two conditions needed for warfare to cause CGS are(1) that variation in cultural traits between groups in fluenc- es variation in success in warfare, and (2) that variation insuccess in warfare in fluences the spread of cultural traits. Losers of military competitions are sometimes killed out-right and are sometimes voluntarily or involuntarily incor-porated into the victorious society. Success and failureare often due to variation in the competing societies 'tech- nology, norms, and institutions. Losers or potential loserswill also often attempt to emulate the technology and insti-tutions of stronger societies. Humans can make war because we solve collective action problems at large scales. Combatants experience the hazardsof war, but the bene ts of victory are widely shared, even by those who avoid the risks. Human societies that successfullysuppress and sanction within-group violence, can still suffer high mortality from intergroup con flict. For instance, in the Turkana, a tribe of about one million people living in north-ern Kenya, 1% of mortality among Turkana men is from vi-olence among Turkana, whereas 50% is from inter-ethnicraids (Mathew & Boyd 2011 ). Formal models indicate that genetic group selection can only support warfare in groups of, at most, a few dozen in-dividuals (Choi & Bowles 2007 ). However, lethal inter- group violence occurs between large human groupswithin which genetic relatedness is low and individuals donot know each other personally. For example, one WWIIengagement alone, the Battle of Stalingrad, involvedmore than 1.7 million soldiers and produced over twomillion military and civilian casualties (Glantz & House1998 ). CGS can favor the evolution of warfare between cul- tural groups comprising hundreds to millions of mostly ge-netically unrelated individuals. Even in politically un-centralized societies, CGS on simple institutions can support large-scale con flicts. The Turkana frequently raid neighboring ethnic groups forcattle (Mathew & Boyd 2011 ). The scale of such raids can be very large despite the absence of hierarchical insti-tutions. The average raid includes 315 men, with someraids including up to a thousand. Most participants arenot close kin, and participants come from a wide swatheof Turkana society, including multiple sub-territories.This means that reciprocity based on warriors 'reputations cannot by itself maintain cooperation in the raiding party.Instead, the Turkana have cultural norms that discouragecowardice, norms that are enforced by peers who sanctionviolators in their local group. In vignette studies, Turkanaraiders had very positive attitudes toward warriors whoraided animals from another ethnic group and very nega- tive attitudes toward those who raided another Turkana territory, even though the respondents 'own territory would bene t from the spoils in both situations. This pattern strongly supports CGS operating among theTurkana and neighboring groups having similar patternsof ethnolinguistic-scale cattle raiding. The commonethnic identity of Turkana combined with effective normsRicherson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 11http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59and institutions are the proximate cultural mechanisms that make large-scale raiding possible. Archaeological and ethnographic data suggest that warfare occurred in a suf ciently wide range of societies for long enough (Gat 2008 ) to be a gene-culture coevolu- tionary force. Warfare occurs in societies pre-dating agri- culture and sedentary living (Keeley 1997 ). Nevertheless, the direct evidence for warfare in the Pleistocene is verylimited, and doubts about war 's importance before the Ho- locene persist (Guthrie 2005 ). As a consequence of warfare, the cultural traits of the successful groups often spread and the cultural traits of de-feated groups and polities often decline. Similarly, groupswith institutions that more effectively foster cooperationare most likely to be the victor (Turchin 2003 ;2006 ). Vic- torious groups often expand their and con-quered peoples. The Mongols (Turchin 2006 ) and Nuer (Kelly 1985 ) are examples of militarily successful societies that absorbed defeated groups. Absorption may bepassive, in which defeated people adopt the identity ofthe dominant group through marriage and/or migration,or it can be coercive. Slaves captured by the Comanche,and their subsequent offspring, became Comanche them-selves after one or two generations (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2008 ). Cultural systems associated with Islam and Christianityhave also spread in part through military conquests, facili-tated by coercive as well as voluntary conversion ofpeoples dominated by the victors. Soltis et al. ( 1995 ) esti- mated group extinction rates from the differential groupextinction and conversion of losers in a sample of societiesin Papua New Guinea. They found that the estimated ex-tinction rates would allow a group bene cial cultural trait to spread to most of a meta-population in 500 -1,000 years. This is consistent with the gradual increase in thecomplexity and size of societies over the last 10 millennia. Variation in economic systems and political institutions between societies also affects military success. Agricultural-istsnd it easier to stockpile resources to feed standing armies than herders (Turchin 2006 ). Tilly ( 1992 ) argues that sovereign territorial states out-competed both empires and feudal societies because they were betterable to raise capital for military campaigns. Over the past 200 years, democracies have been replac- ing autocracies. Part of the reason may be because democ-racies have been more likely to win wars (Reiter & Stam2002 ). Democratic leaders seem to be better at picking the wars they ght, and they are more politically account- able when wars are lost. Soldiers from democratic nationsalso seem to ght more effectively than soldiers from non-democratic nations, even after controlling for wealthand other measures of power, perhaps because they moreconsistently report that they nd their government 's war policies legitimate (Reiter & Stam 2002 ). To summarize, warfare clearly demonstrates the require- ments for CGS. Cultural traits that affect military successare highly variable, and success in war tends to spreadsuch traits by all three forms of CGS. 5.2. Competition between economic organizations Competition between human organizations is certainly notrestricted to violent con flict. Economic competition is an important and typically peaceful form of CGS. EconomicCGS has a long history (Curtin 1984 ) and is very importantin modern societies. It is partly responsible for ongoing rapid evolution in the domains of organizational rules,structure, business practices, and technology. Economists have noted that competition among rms creates a Darwinian dynamic (Nelson & Winter 1982 ; Schumpeter et al. 1934 ; Veblen 1898 ). Well-run rms prot and survive, while poorly run rms with losses expire. This selection of rms in the market was part of what Schumpeter et al. ( 1934 ) called \"creative destruction. \" Some of the success and failure of individual rms is caused by the structure, management style, institutions, and otheraspects of the culture of the rm itself. Business organiza- tions have been a focus of social identity research and re-search on the impact of social identity on organizationperformance (Ashforth et al. 2008 ). New employees acquire the rm's culture through formal and informal socialization and incorporate the rm's culture as part of their social identity. When those cultural differences in flu- ence a rm's success, CGS will occur. Nelson and Winter 's (1982 ) highly cited classic argues that much of the impor- tant know-how in fluencing rm success is tacit, embedded in the skills of individuals and informal routines of interac-tion. This information is hard to acquire by borrowing fromsuccessful rms and even selective hiring. Hence, cultural differences between rms tend to persist, and differential expansion and contraction of rms is very active despite at- tempts to acquire the practices of more successful rms. Economists routinely study all three mechanisms of CGS in competitive market systems. The differential prolifera-tion (market entry and split) and extinction (market exitand bankruptcy) of rms in fluences the future population ofrms and frequencies of business practices. Empirical studies of selection on economic organizations owe muchto the pioneering work of Hannan and Freeman ( 1993 ), which has attracted thousands of citations. An example isthe evolution of the synthetic dye industry in the 19thcentury (Murmann 2003 ). The earliest synthetic dye rms were British, but German rms lobbied provincial govern- ments to support research chemists in their universities. The students of the chemists often found jobs in German dye companies, leading to the development of the rst in- dustrial research and development (R&D) laboratories. Asa result, German companies were able to out-innovate theirBritish counterparts, and by 1900 they dominated theglobal market. Inspired by successful large-scale R&Dduring WWII, British and American governments, univer-sities, and rms started to copy German R&D institutions on a large scale (Murmann 2003 ). The natural selection of rms occurs when corporate cul- tures do not match the needs of the external environment(e.g., McGovern 2007 ). Valuable information also flows between rms through selective imitation and best-practice adoption (e.g., Bolton 1993 ; Haunschild 1993 ) as well as patent licensing and corporate espionage. Informationalso migrates with employees through processes such astalent raiding (Gardner 2003 ) and spin-off companies. Klepper and Sleeper ( 2005 ) showed that, in the laser indus- try, spin-off companies do indeed inherit the capacities oftheir parent organizations. Substantial quantitative evidence for CGS within eco- nomic systems comes from research on competitionbetween technology rms. For example, Derfus et al. (2008 ) observed that the market for hard disk drives created a headlong competitive race to stay near theRicherson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 12 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59forefront of technology; failure to keep up led to bank- ruptcy. Such competition led to various market-level out-comes, such as leapfrogging, in which organizationscompeting from a lagging position were more responsiveto competition than better-positioned competitors(Barnett & Pontikes 2008 ). A history of competitive success tends to create a tendency for increased mistakes. Higher failure and exit rates have been observed in compa-nies with less competitive experience, such as monopolists(Barnett & McKendrick 2004 ). Murmann ( 2003 ) found that the originally dominant British dye rms suffered through their lack of exposure to competition. A higherrate of market entry and exit in the German dye industryled to a greater exploration of different business practices,resulting in greater variation and stronger selection. Thesuccess of Silicon Valley derives from Valley-wide \"ecosys- temic \"institutions that accelerate all three forms of CGS (Hwang & Horowitt 2012 ). For example, new rms form easily in order to exploit promising ideas, and investors, en-trepreneurs, and founding employees expect that most willfail. An ef cient system of gossip ensures a general aware- ness of individuals 'reputation, reducing the risk that the high mobility generated by rapid rm turnover will be ex- ploited by unscrupulous individuals. Modern nations intentionally regulate and promote CGS in the economic domain (Motta 2004 ). Regulators force busi- nesses to compete through anti-monopoly legislation. Patentsystems attempt to induce the socially optimal amount ofR&D. During the patent period, rms can recover large R&D costs, but eventually everyone can use the off-patent in-novation. Collusion and anti-poaching agreements betweencompanies are outlawed in order to guarantee competition.International free-trade agreements attempt to limit nationalprotection of domestic companies at the expense of foreigncompetitors. Therefore, the mechanisms of CGS are notjust present in modern economies, but are the deliberatefocus of institutional design at the national and internationallevel. In general terms, these policies, at least in principle,benet ordinary citizens by tailoring economic group selec- tion to meet common social goals. These national regulations may themselves constitute another level of organizational se-lection above the rm, in which governments, industries, and other domestic organizations are selected over time via differ-ential success, learning, and migration between countries.The interplay between CGS at the level of the rm and the level of the nation is the subject of much national and inter-national political discussion. 5.3. Religious competition The action of CGS on variation in religious institutions hasbeen observed in a number of historical and contemporarypopulations, often resulting in the expansion of one culturalgroup relative to others. Religious ethical systems are oftenintegrated into the basic norms and institutions of a society.It is common for different religions to have different birthor death rates, and they often compete for converts. Scholars have suggested many examples of the role of re- ligion in competition between groups. The advent of \"Axial Age\"universalistic religions around 500 B.C.E. created overarching ethical systems. They introduced the innova-tion of doctrinal mode rituals that could unite formerly dis-parate cultures and thus favored expansion of empires tounits large enough to resist Central Asian invaders, whohad perfected horse archery (Turchin 2009 ; Whitehouse 2002 ). Christians in the Roman Empire were more likely to practice mutual aid and economic cooperation thannon-Christians (Stark 1997 ). Christian cooperators posi- tively assorted through association in spiritual communities.Non-cooperators were punished with ostracism. This com- bination led to greater success in dealing with resource scarcity and disease and thus to higher survival, reproduc-tion, and conversion rates that eventually led to Christianitybeing the state religion of the Empire and its successor pol-ities. Early Islam promoted strict sacred norms of fairnessand unity among co-religionists, leading to its remarkablyrapid expansion. Reduced small-scale tribal warfare, in-creased external defense, and the creation of institutionsthat greatly facilitated long distance trade facilitated mate-rial success, intergroup military success, and large conver-sion rates (Ibrahim 1990 ). Recent history suggests that competition between groups based on variation of religious belief and ritual practice con-tinues today. An analysis of demographic data from morethan 800 communes in the United States over a 200-yearperiod revealed a strong correlation between costly ritualdisplays and the longevity of the commune (Sosis & Bressler2003 ). Finke and Stark 's(1992 ) study of U.S. religious history documented an overall increase in churchgoingsince independence, as well as large shifts among denomina-tions. Hout et al. ( 2001 ) conducted a pioneering quantitative micro-evolutionary study of the relative expansion and con-traction of Protestant churches in the United States duringthe 20th century. They found that variation in birth-ratesrather than conversion rates mainly drove the changes. Pro-natal norms and strong cultural isolation are leading to rapiddemographic expansion of the more traditional or \"Old Order \"Anabaptists (Kraybill & Bowman 2001 ) relative to almost all other North American subcultures. The Anabap-tist Hutterites are North America 's most successful commu- nal movement. They have very high population growth ratesresulting from strongly pronatal norms and low apostasy, ar-guably caused by their strongly isolationist practices (Sato et al. 1994 ). The number of Evangelical Protestant churches increased relative to that of Roman Catholic churches inLatin America during the 20th century, mainly due totheir stronger emphasis on missionary work (Stoll 1990 ). Not surprisingly, given the breadth of evidence, religious variation is frequently cited as one of the most importantexamples of CGS (e.g., Wilson 2002 ). 6. Evidence for group-level functionality If CGS has operated on human cultures directly, and indi- rectly on human genes via gene-culture coevolution, thenwe would expect to nd clear examples of design for group function. Arguments for group selection in humans haveoften stressed the evidence from design (e.g., Wilson2002 ), whereas we have so far stressed process-level evi- dence. However, the evidence from design is also impor-tant and compelling. We discuss language, social control,and religion as examples. 6.1. Language Language re flects the operation of CGS in three different ways. First, language is necessary for sophisticated normsRicherson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 13http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59and institutions to function. Second, language only func- tions if there is a considerable degree of trust among speak-ers, who comprise groups far larger than families. Third,language differences are among the most importantmarkers of group boundaries, and limited linguistic com-munication makes the diffusion of institutions between so- cieties more dif cult. Humans use language to formulate and transmit social norms and to operate institutional systems of reward andpunishment that stabilize these norms. Maynard Smithand Szathm\u00e1ry ( 1995 ) nominated language as the key inno- vation leading to human societies arriving at a new level ofbiological organization. Smith ( 2010 ) reviews the ample ev- idence that language plays an important role in solving col-lective action problems. Norms and institutions arearticulated publicly so that individuals can understandthem. Individuals who appear not to understand them aretypically subjected to verbal reprimands. Institutionalchange is advocated and discussed in speeches and codi ed by verbal consensus. In complex societies, written recordsevolved to make possible quite intricate institutions. Eventhe most sel sh political operators usually take care to frame their public arguments to give the impression thatthey are furthering the general welfare. Much variation in norms and institutions is deeply em- bedded in the vocabulary and syntax of languages (Wierz-bicka 1992 ). Such linguistically encoded information is often tacit knowledge that is shared by speakers but diffus-es with dif culty to other languages. Language differences thus help preserve the between-group variation that CGSacts on. Expanding language families often mark the expan-sion of a complex of technical and social innovations; theIndo-European, Bantu, Tupi, and Austronesian familiesare examples, as we have noted in section 3.2. The evolution of the capacity for languages that can serve cooperative functions is a considerable puzzle, because theexistence of human language presupposes cooperation(Hurford 2007 ). Communication systems in animals are largely restricted to costly signals or situations where decep- tive signals can be detected and punished (Lachmann et al. 2001 ). In such systems, very little information is transmitted and syntactic complexity is quite limited (Hurford 2007 ). Unless listeners are able to trust speakers more often thannot, a complex symbolic language would be useless. Ifmost speech acts were self-serving and/or deceptive, listen-ers would not bother to listen. Thus, at least a modicum oftrust and cooperation seems necessary before a low-costhigh- delity communication system could begin to evolve. Scholars often assume that language is the premier mecha-nism for cultural transmission. If so, how could cultureitself, much less CGS, ever have gotten off the ground? How could CGS have existed before language? A plausi- ble answer is that culture was already tolerably complexbefore the capacity for language began to evolve. Stonetool manufacture may go back three million years, andedge-wear evidence suggests that early stone tools wereused to make a toolkit of perishable materials such aswood and hides. Merlin Donald ( 1991 ) hypothesizes that Homo erectus and related Lower and Middle Pleistocene hominins were talented mimics, and that mimesis servedas the evolutionary basis on which language could subse-quently evolve. Donald reviews evidence that 19th-century deaf-mutes could learn complex manual skills byimitation alone. They also acquired basic social normsand integrated themselves into complex institutions. Dances and similar motor rituals are among the thingsthat pre-linguistic but highly mimetic humans could likelyacquire. Such rituals today have powerful group-bondingeffects and are therefore commonly incorporated into reli-gious and secular patriotic celebrations (see sect. 6.3). Thus, a scenario in which the capacity for complex trust- worthy language evolved by CGS and culture-led gene-culture coevolution (see sect. 2.2), is plausible. All therecent evolutionary theories of the capacity for language,beginning with Pinker and Bloom 's(1990 ) pioneering article, are culture-led gene-culture coevolutionary hypoth-eses. Theories differ mainly in the extent to which geneshave responded to the coevolutionary pressure with lan-guage-speci c cognitive structures. Language diversity suggests that language is an important component of CGS. The stunning diversity of languagesshows that differences between languages readily evolve(Nettle 1999 ). Why? Following the arguments for the ef ciency having innate, information-rich cognitivemodules (Tooby & Cosmides 1992 ), having tight constraints on languages ought to make them easier and quicker to learnboth for children and for people wanting to be able to speakmultiple languages. It is easy to imagine how tight, innateconstraints might affect language (Sampson 2005 ), but no evidence of such constraints has been observed. Languagesare highly variable in every element that has been studiedclosely (Newmeyer 2004 ). It might be that language differ- ences, like other symbolic differences, evolve to limit com- munication between groups (see sect. 2.1). Sociolinguistsnd that small but socially signi cant dialect differences emerge rapidly along social fault lines, implicating theactive evolution of symbolic marking rather than, or in addi-tion to, drift-like differentiation of languages (Labov 2001 ). Leaders of dialect evolution are typically individuals withhigh local prestige. Social identity theorists have shownleader charisma to be essentially a recognition by followersthat a leader is prototypical of the in-group (Steffens et al.2014 ). The ensuing emotional identi cation of followers with their leaders probably leads to followers adopting the speech variants of such leaders. The evolution of symbolicboundaries to communication will help protect group-levelcultural variation from the homogenizing effects of migra-tion, and thus favor the operation of CGS. Linguistic variation is extremely important in maintain- ing social structure and in fluencing social judgments, as we saw in the case of children 's early learning biases (sect. 4.2). In small-scale societies, language differencesgenerally mark the boundaries of groups that con flict (Nettle 1999 ). It is as if CGS favors not being able to under- stand those whom you likely cannot trust. Even at the scaleof businesses and similar groups whose members speak thesame language, group-speci c jargon often distinguishes in- siders from outsiders. Thus, an innate capacity for the rapidcultural evolution of linguistic and other symbolic differ-ences plausibly coevolved with group selection on culturalvariation (see sect. 2.2). Language variation helps maintainbetween-group variation in other cultural domains, contrib-uting to CGS, but it is also likely to be a product of it. 6.2. Crime, deviance, and punishment Violent or peaceful competition between organizationsdepends upon the preservation of between-organizationRicherson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 14 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59differences, and to compete successfully, an organization must solve dilemmas of cooperation among its members(Wilson 2002 ). CGS will tend to favor societies that produce public goods like defense, transportation infra-structure, and a fair legal system. One of the most impor-tant public goods produced in human societies are institutions of order and justice that protect individuals from predators and public goods from free-riders. All suc-cessful small-scale common property systems have institu-tions for monitoring and punishing defectors (Ostrom1990 ). In contemporary societies, measures of culturally in- herited trust are correlated with economic performance(Algan & Cahuc 2010 ). Theoretical models (e.g., Boyd et al. 2003 ) and experiments (Fehr & Gachter 2002 ) suggest that moralistic punishment can be a very effectivemechanism for promoting cooperation. Thus, we expectthat the quality of institutions regulating crime and devi-ance will play a signi cant role in the performance of human organizations. In experimental settings, peoplereadily migrate from model societies that do not have sanc-tioning institutions to join ones that do (G\u00fcrerk et al. 2006 ). In the coevolutionary long run, social institutions of moni-toring, reward, and punishment were probably the mainfactors exerting negative selection on genes that promoteantisocial behavior and positive selection on genes thatlead to prosocial dispositions (see sect. 2.2). Punishers do not even need to be cooperative themselves to furnish some of the bene ts of cooperation (Eldakar & Wilson 2008 ), but many experiments have detected altruistic punishment (Fehr & Gachter 2002 ). An important theme of our argument is that the question of altruism as a proximatemechanism is not central to the issue of CGS. CGS canfavor reputational and other motivational systems that alterindividual incentives, thereby reducing or eliminating theneed for altruism (Fehr & Henrich 2003 ; Panchanathan & Boyd 2004 ). Altruistic behaviors have been the focus of models and experiments because they are the hardest onesto account for, not because they are empirically the most im-portant. Careful experimental attempts to expose covert self- interested motives have found support for an \"empathy altru- ism\"hypothesis (Batson 2011 ). In experimental treatments designed to induce research participants to empathize withsomeone who is going to suffer a harm, many people will vol-unteer to help the victim at a cost to themselves. Batson 's program of experiments was designed to show that variousegoistic hypotheses could not entirely explain these results.Models suggest that the evolution of altruistic punishmentis likely to be frequency dependent (Boyd & Richerson1992b ). If punishment is suf ciently costly to the punished and cheap to the punisher, a relatively few punishers suf ce to encourage reluctant cooperators and would-be defectorsto cooperate. Experimental studies using economic gamessupport the ndings of models. They nd much individual variation both in propensities to cooperate and to punishnon-cooperators (Henrich et al. 2010a ; Kurzban & Houser 2005 ). Only a minority of participants act altruistically. We are inclined to think that evolution has built an element ofgenuine empathy and true altruism into our social psychologybecause monitoring and punishment are costly to punishersand to punishees, but many people obey norms mainlybecause deviance is punished. Historical and ethnographic data suggest that variation in the effectiveness of controlling self-seeking behavior isrelated to all three forms of group selection. Forexample, Turchin and Nefedov ( 2009 ) studied dynastic cycles in agrarian societies. Elite groups do provide servicesin such societies, but they have a tendency to grow andbecome increasingly corrupt over time. Corrupt elitestend to be replaced by competitors who provide better gov-ernance. Successful empires, such as those of ancient Rome and Han China, had more effective institutions for produc- ing public goods and incorporating new populations intotheir expanding polities than their competitors. The increas-ing acceptance of the rule of law in Early Modern Europe isfundamental to that region 's explosive demographic and eco- nomic growth (North et al. 2009 ). In the modern world, large numbers of migrants move from countries with lownorms of civic cooperation and poor rule of law to countrieswith more civic cooperation and better rule of law (Boyd &Richerson 2009 ). Thus, we have ample evidence that inter- nal regulatory systems control deviance and solve dilemmasof cooperation to varying degrees of effectiveness. Much ofthe last ve millennia of human history can be read as a slow, halting increase in the effectiveness of such institutions (e.g.,Fukuyama 2011 ). 6.3. Religion and ritual Religions furnish group-boundary -dening symbols, moral justications for institutions of social control, and rituals that celebrate and facilitate an organization 's solidarity. Reli- gions contain effective mechanisms for reducing internalvariation through sacred principles and norm-enforcingrules of reward, punishment, and exclusion, which bind par-ticipants into moral communities (Atran 2010 ; Graham & Haidt 2010 ; Rappaport 1999 ). Numerous studies have found evidence for group-functional properties of religions(Atran 2002 ; Atran & Norenzayan 2005 ;B o y e r 2001 ). The success of a number of key cultural innovations that generate well-documented associations between in-groupprosociality and religious/ritual participation appear to beclear examples of group functionality (Henrich et al.2010a ; Norenzayan & Shariff 2008 ). Belief in moralizing high gods is associated with cooperative altruism (Johnson2005 ; Shariff et al. 2009 ) and willingness to punish non-co- operators (McKay et al. 2011 ). Ethnographic, historical, and experimental evidence suggest that synchronizeddance and rhythmic ritual facilitate coordination andbonding of groups, and relieve low-level in-group con flict (Kirschner Tomasello 2010 ). Theoretical arguments (Iannaccone 1992 ), support- ed by quantitative observations (Sosis & Bressler 2003 ; Sosis & Ruf fle2003 ), suggest that costly signals of group membership, such as hard-to-perform rituals and other sac-rices, help groups weed out free-riders and foster in- group altruism. A common characteristic of religions issacred rules (Durkheim 1912 ; Rappaport 1999 ). They supply a stable and enforceable moral code, held as inviola-ble by religious adherents (Atran 2010 ). These often man- ifest as prosocial rules, including norms of fairness andnorms of group defense, and also as symbolic systems that demarcate in-group membership. At the same time, of course, religions (and other ideologies), when used tocreate in-group solidarity, sometimes create fear andhatred of out-groups (West 1941 ). CGS is not utopian! Non-religious institutions also carry out rituals as part of their group culture, and they have similar effects. McNeill(1995 ) gives evidence that the ritual of close-order drillRicherson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 15http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59reshaped warfare by facilitating in-group cooperation and camaraderie, leading to the higher success of groups thatperform these seemingly functionally meaningless rituals. 7. Conclusion The evidence we have outlined in this article makes the case that culture varies between human groups ranging insize from organizations within societies to ethnolinguistictribes and nations, and even multi-ethnic empires. Thesegroups are often symbolically marked, have more or lessformal criteria for membership, and possess distinctivesocial institutions. This variation is transmitted to new gen-erations by the human capacity to acquire norms and socialinstitutions via imitation and teaching. Institutions includemechanisms of selective punishment and reward thatreduce small-scale variation in behavior. Human organiza-tions compete, often in highly organized ways, and the success and failure of groups in such competitions is often determined by institutional and other cultural differ-ences. As Darwin ( 1874 ) argued in The Descent of Man , many human groups meet the basic criteria necessary forselection to operate: heritable variation and competition,the outcome of which is based on that heritable variation.Ethnographic evidence of the prerequisites for and opera-tion of CGS in the simplest societies suggests that CGS hasoperated in our lineage for a few tens of millennia, if notlonger. If so, the cooperative imperatives produced by ru-dimentary culturally transmitted institutions may wellhave shaped our innate social psychology. This is re flected by the observation that young children learn norms and acton them, but chimpanzee societies have, at best, rudimen-tary norms. Individual-level human decisions regarding theinvention of new cultural variants, the spread of variants bydiffusion, and the choices of group af liation are likely to be strongly colored by moral intuitions like sympathy andpatriotism. The current direct evidence for culture-led gene-culture coevolution is only strong for genes that donot directly affect behavior, but evidence regarding behav-ioral traits is likely to improve greatly in the next decade. We submit that the evidence sketched here is more than sufcient to justify taking the CGS hypothesis seriously as a basic explanation for our species 'highly unusual ability to create large societies with widespread cooperationbetween non-relatives. We do not see how any of the alter-natives to CGS can easily account for the institutionalizedcooperation that characterizes human societies. We cer-tainly do not claim that a large body of studies has metthe gold standard of accurately estimating the strength ofany of the three CGS processes we have discussed. Norhave we estimated the strength of culture-based social se-lection on human genes. These projects are in theirinfancy. We have pointed to excellent pioneering studiesshowing that a proper quantitative investigation of culturalevolution and gene-culture coevolution is possible (e.g.,Bouckaert et al. 2012 ; Hout et al. 2001 ; Itan et al. 2009 ). We need an empirical game theory that estimates costsand bene ts generated by people playing various strategies in institutional games. Do individuals bear costs or neglectto take bene ts that accrue to them as individuals in order to bene t their social groups? How large are such bene ts and costs? Are organizations with many individuals who arewilling to bear costs or forego bene ts really more likely to win contests with other groups, or attract imitators and im-migrants? How does rewarding individuals with prestige orsymbolically with medals and prizes affect their genetictness or cultural success? The bad news is that the games people play are very complex, and many of thosemost relevant to human evolution took place many genera-tions ago. The good news is that evolutionary biologistshave struggled fairly successfully with similar complexitiesin organic evolution (Endler 1986 ). Appendix Table 1.

Our evidence fails to corroborate two central predictionsof the hypothesis: that the cultural group is the unit of evolution, andthat cultural homogenization is to be expected as the outcome of a selective process. While we agree with Richerson et al. that prosocial emotions play a central role in fostering group cohesion (Acedo-Carmona & Gomila 2013 ;2014b ), we disagree with them in their lack of enough attention to the internal complexity within social groups.Such internal structure, though, casts doubt on the role that group competition is required to play according to the culturalgroup selection (CGS) hypothesis, as well as on the role culture is assigned. Two arguments are developed to articulate this point, supported by eldwork evidence from Northern Ghana and Oaxaca (M\u00e9xico). These are regions characterized by the co-existence of multi-ethnic, multicultural groups and are therefore well-suited to put the predictions of CGS hypothesis to the test, which fail to get corroborated. Argument 1. The CGS hypothesis contends that the cultural group is the relevant unit of selection for the evolution of coopera-tion. It follows from this that members of a group should cooperate equally with any member of the group, beyond kin. Instead, what we found in our eldwork is that individuals within a group preferential- ly cooperate with the members of their respective \"trust circles, \" and that these trust circles are small groups related to a past history of reciprocation and af liation (Acedo-Carmona & Gomila 2015 ). The cultural group is a much bigger unit, whose degree of in- ternal cohesion derives from the topology of connections amongthese small groups (Acedo-Carmona & Gomila 2014b ). This suggests that cultural groups are not the basic unit of selec- tion of human societies -rather, small groups are, for the follow- ing reasons: a. Even in contexts where no common culture exists, individ- uals develop social ties (Zhou et al. 2005 ) that make cooperation possible, such as trust relationships. b. The social brain is ready to develop close relationships (Roberts et al. 2009 ). So, it is reasonable to think that psycholog- ical dispositions to create and maintain bonds in their immediateTable 1 ( Continued ) Data description Groups (sample size) Group type (1=religious,2=political,3=ethnic, 4=nations/ provinces)F ST Reference 2006.

Evidence from Northern Ghana also suggests that small groups are more resistant and flexible at a time to face to hard challenges (Acedo-Carmona & Gomila 2014a ). d. Even in contemporary societies, small groups continue playing a central role of structuring cooperation within thesociety (sociologists call this phenomenon \"social capital \"; Putnam 1993 ). Selective processes at the cultural group level, therefore, cannot be basic, but dependent upon their respective internal structure of several groups, including kin-based groups and af li- ation groups, with different degrees of internal cohesion and in- terconnection. For example, sometimes cultural groups mergeinto bigger ones, and sometimes groups split: Competition among groups may have little to do with these processes, but rather with internal processes at the small-group level. Argument 2. The CGS hypothesis predicts regional cultural homogenization in the long run: If there is competition among co-local cultural groups, the successful one is deemed to prevail according to CGS, either by exclusion of the other, or by absorp- tion/assimilation (by imitation of the most successful one, for in-stance). However, this is not what happened, either in Northern Ghana or in Oaxaca -on the contrary, both regions are inhabited by a plurality of cultural groups, which coexist and also cooperate, while keeping their distinctive ethnic identities (Acedo-Carmona & Gomila, 2015 ). In both cases, there are different origins, a set- tlement period, and a long history of interaction among the groups within the same region, while linguistic and cultural diversity con- tinues, despite the fact that some ethnic groups do better than others in terms of status and welfare. This suggests that the role of culture may have more to do with reinforcing group cohesion than promoting group competition. A shared culture may facilitate cooperation by inducing a positive expectation from individuals whose identities and values are shared (Tanis & Postmes 2005 ). But in a non-instrumental way, it is not something one can choose. Culture migrations do nottake place strategically because individuals by nature do not change their group identity (Bhugra & Becker 2005 ). The affec- tive sense of familiarity and belonging provided by cultural iden-tity is too strong to allow an easy detachment toward another more advantageous culture. On the other hand, slow cultural changes take place even in successful cultural groups. The CGS hypothesis emphasizes the well-known in-group/out- group bias (Chen & Xin Li 2009 ). However, the in-group bias that contributes to foster internal cohesion does not need to involve aversion to other groups (M\u00e4s & Dijkstra 2014 ). This aversion emerges only in cases of competition for resources (Foley & Gamble 2009 ). From this point of view, cultural differentiation appears as the by-product of an adaptive process to a speci c en- vironment by a society (Alvard 2003 ), rather than a way to compete with other social groups in the rst place, while keeping track of the basic forms of social cohesion (such as trust). This approach also may account for the diversity of existing cultures, even in the same territory: The prediction is that eachsociety will take advantage of some of the opportunities of the en- vironment, such as peasants versus shepherds or merchants versus state of cials, as it happens in Northern Ghana (Acedo-Carmona & Gomila 2014a ). Competition derived from population explosion is a too recent phenomenon to have played an evolutionary role. In summary, in our view, the cement of society is to be found in the basic human disposition to trust each other, which gives rise to small groups. Societies are constituted by these groups, and theirinterrelationships are different. Culture certainly molds these in- terrelationships and organization, according to tradition and envi- ronmental conditions. But its role in fostering cooperation does not seem to be primarily in providing a competitive advantage, as claimed by CGS.Cultural evolution need not imply group selection doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000059, e32 Dorsa Amir,aMatthew R. Jordan,band David G. Yale University, New Haven, CT 06511; bDepartment of Psychology, make a compelling case for cultural evolution. In focusing on cultural group selection, however, they neglect important individual-level accounts of cultural evolution. While scienti c discourse typically links cultural evolution to group selection and genetic evolutionto individual selection, this association is due to historical accident only.We thus call for more consideration of individual-level cultural evolution. The target article provides compelling evidence that culture is a real phenomenon that varies across groups and evolves over time. The authors go on to argue that cultural evolution, with se-lection occurring at the level of the group, is necessary for explain- ing human cooperation. In doing so, however, they overlook the importance of individual- level cultural evolution. Cultural evolution need not be focused on group-level selec- tion. As long as variation exists in ideas (or strategies, in a game- theoretic context), and ideas or strategies that are more successful are more likely to be adopted by others, then cultural evolution is occurring. From a mathematical perspective, such a process is for-mally equivalent to (individual-level) genetic evolution, and it can explain both interpersonal cooperation and the emergence of in- stitutions that govern human behavior. With respect to human cooperation, consider the theoretical per- spective offered by the social heuristics hypothesis (SHH), whichcombines evolution with dual-process models of cognition. The SHH posits that individuals internalize strategies that are typi- cally advantageous in daily life (Rand et al. 2014b ) and carry these automatic and intuitive responses with them into atypical social sit- uations (such as laboratory experiments). Therefore, imitation andlearning, as shaped by one 's physical and cultural environment, determine an individual 's internalized norms and preferences. Such a process can lead to substantial variation in norms across groups (as different groups inhabit different environments) and support the evolution of cooperation in one-shot anonymous settings(via spillovers from the cooperation that is typically advantageous due to reciprocity, reputation, and punishment). Empirical support for the SHH comes from evidence that exper- imentally inducing greater intuitive thinking promotes cooperation in one-shot anonymous economic games relative to inducing delibera- tion: Applying time constraints (Cone & Rand 2014 ;R a n de ta l . 2012 ; Rand & Kraft-Todd 2014 ;R a n de ta l ), conceptually priming intuition (Lotz n de ta l . 2012 ), inducing cognitive load (Cornelissen et al. 2011 ;R o c he ta l . 2000 ; Schulz et al. 2014 ), or increasing the immediacy of payments (Dreber et al. 2014 ; Kovarik 2009 ) can increase participants 'willingness to pay costs to provide bene ts to strangers. Furthermore, cultural factors, such as trust of daily-life interaction partners, alter participants 'intuitive re- sponses as predicted by such a theory: Intuition only promotes coop- eration among those who come from a culture of cooperation and trust, where cooperation is thus advantageous (Capraro & Cococcioni 2015 ; Rand & Kraft-Todd 2014 ). Direct evidence of the spillover effects that are at the heart of the SHH comes from laboratory exper-iments where participants are randomly assigned to interact under rules that make cooperation or defection advantageous: Participants experiencing a social environment that favors defection are dramati-cally less prosocial in subsequent one-shot anonymous interactions, but only if they rely on intuitive, heuristic processing (Peysakhovich &R a n d 2015 ).Commentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 20 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59This theory accommodates the innate learning structures used in norm acquisition (Hamlin et al. 2011), while also explaining cross-cul- tural differences in norms and preferences (Ellingsen et al. G\u00e4chter et al. 2010; Henrich et al. 2001;2010b ;H e r r m a n ne ta l . 2008). Importantly, the SHH accomplishes this without an appeal to group selection or intergroup con flict. An individual bene ts from in- ternalizing successful strategies, and in typical settings where mecha-nisms for the evolution of cooperation are operating, what is good for the individual winds up also being bene cial for the group. Thus, improving the group 's welfare occurs as a side e ffect of selection max- imizing individual payoffs, rather than as the cause of that selection. What about institutions? By enforcing norms of cooperation, insti- tutions play a critical role in stabilizing payoff structures that simulta- neously optimize social and indivi dual welfare. Can the emergence of such institutions be explained by i ndividual-level forces? Indeed, it can. Consider the institution of democratic voting. Under a median voting rule, for instance, individuals engaged in a group cooperation endeavor each vote for a contribution amount, and then all partici- pants are forced to contribute the amount speci ed by the median voter (Bernard et al. 2013; Deacon & Shapiro 1975 ;H a u s e re ta l . 2014 ; Walker et al. 2000 ) .U n d e rs u c ha ni n s t i t u t i o n ,e v e ns e l f - i n t e r - ested people would vote for contribution to a public good, because in- dividuals earn higher payoffs in a group where everyone contributes. Since the institution forces all participants to behave in the same way, the free-rider problem is eliminated, and individual and collective in-terests are aligned. Furthermore, si milar logic would cause individual- level forces to favor joining or founding such an institution, rather than preferring a scenario where free-riding was possible (and thus coop- eration was doomed). Indeed, experiments show that people \"vote with their feet \"and learn to choose institutions with sanctions over a sanction-free alternative (G\u00fcrerk et al. 2006 ; Rockenbach & Milinski 2006 ). These studies capture the essent ial components of institution- alized cooperation: When institutions can homogenize individualbehavior through norm enforceme nt, social welfare and individual welfare are maximized by the same strategy. Thus, cultural evolution and learning need not be linked to group- level selection, and genetic evolution to individual-level selection, as is done in the target article (and in much of the literature on culturalevolution more broadly). Both of these dimensions of the debate re- garding human evolution can vary independently (Rand & Nowak 2013 ). A helpful analogy comes from American politics, where social and scal conservatism, two independent dimensions of polit- ical attitudes, tend to strongly co-vary because of the United States ' two-party system. However, these two variables do not need to co- vary: An individual can be socially liberal and scally conservative (e.g., libertarian) or socially conservative and scally liberal. Similar- ly, scholars can advocate for the importance of cultural evolution without invoking group selection, an intellectual space which isoften left unoccupied. It is largely due to historical accident that cul- tural evolution and group selection have come to be linked (the most successful proponents of the importance of culture are also advo-cates of group selection). Continuing to develop individual-level ac- counts of cultural evolution is essential for deepening our understanding of human evolution and prosociality.

However, they do not demonstrate its causal precedence for any trait, let alone its \"essentialness. \"To do so, they must show that a particular group trait was caused by cultural transmission, and directly caused differences in group tness. Richerson et al. have done a tremendous job of establishing the plausibility of cultural group selection (CGS) as a process of social evolution. However, they have not shown that it is \"essen- tial\"to human cooperation, or even that it has operated on any single trait. Instead, they show that tness can be partitioned so as to satisfy the conditions for CGS. This is an altogether differ- ent-and much weaker -claim. The total tness of a population can be carved up in multiple ways and attributed to any number of traits, so long as tness and trait values covary. This is one of the more pleasing results derived from the Price equation (e.g., Price 1972 ; see also Hamil- ton1975 ; Marshall 2011 ; Queller 1992 ), and it should bury the notion that individual- and multi-level selection accounts are pre-dictively different. An allele that is favored in inclusive tness or neighbor-modulated models will also be favored in group selection models (and vice versa), because the frequency of that allele is pos- itively correlated with tness whether we conceive of it as affecting individuals or groups. If CGS favors the same tness effects as se- lection on genes (not a given, of course), then the ndings in the target article should not be news. The average tness of individuals is necessarily correlated with the tness of their groups. But just because we could view selection as taking place at the group level does not mean we should. Although individual-leveland multi-level tness partitions are predictively equivalent, they are not causally so (Birch & Okasha 2015 ; Okasha 2015 ; see also Okasha & Paternotte 2012 ). Sometimes, group traits directly cause group tness, but at other times the relationship between the two is merely correlational. Using the wrong tness partition will lead one to infer causality where none exists and, consequently, mischaracterize the adaptation. If there is individual-level variation thatdirectly causes variation in individual tness ( Fig. 1A) , then an individual-level partition is best. Of course, individual variation in traits will also directly affect trait variation at the group level; this is what Williams ( 1966 ) meant in saying that \"a herd of fleet deer\"will simultaneously appear as a \"fleet herd. \" In this instance, the target of selection is the fleetness of individuals, rather than that of the groups they make up. Conversely, trait variance at the group Figure 1 (Barclay & Krupp). Causality in individual and group selection. Arrows show the direction of direct causal effects. ( A) An individual-level partition is justi ed when the individual trait directly affects individual tness and there is no direct relationship between the group trait and group tness.

This results in a group adaptation.

Consider warfare as an illustration. In typical battles where some live and die on each side, individual tnesses cause group tness through simple summation. In ghts where the loser is an- nihilated (e.g., the losing battleship is sunk), however, individual tness is directly caused by group tness -individuals succeed or fail because their group succeeds or fails. A multi-level parti- tion, such as CGS, is only warranted in the latter sort of case. The burden of proof for a CGS account, then, is considerably heavier than what the target article presents. First, CGS needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis; it cannot be accepted whole- sale because it cannot be distinguished from alternative tness partitions in this way. A hypothesis for a particular group trait must be set up against alternative hypotheses. Second, the evi-dence must demonstrate the direct causality of the link between the group trait and group tness ( Fig. 1B) , beyond mere correla- tion. Third, the evidence must show that the group trait has evolved and is maintained speci cally by cultural transmission. While Richerson et al. do not ignore these issues, their \"sketch of the evidence \"falls short of making their case compelling. Many alleged examples of group selection likely re flect individ- ual-level adaptations. The requirements for group, as opposed to individual, adaptation are rather imposing: It is rare for individual human fates to be so intertwined with their group 's fate that group success directly causes (rather than merely correlates with) indi- vidual success, such as all group members succeeding or failing to- gether as a unit because of their group 's composition. Generally, we can expect group traits to directly cause group adaptation only when partners are clonal or when there is extreme repressionof competition (Gardner & Grafen 2009 ; Okasha & Paternotte 2012 ), neither of which describes the human condition well. The examples given by Richerson et al. do not come close tomeeting this criterion. Con flicts that lead to the success or failure of entire groups would, but such circumstances are rare. Moreover, many cases of ostensible cultural transmission are ex- plainable as strategic, individual responses to existing socio-ecolog- ical circumstances. Violent defense of one 's honor -a key aspect of the\"Culture of Honor \"-in the Southern United States is often given as a shining example of cultural transmission (e.g., Nisbett & Cohen 1996 ; Richerson & Boyd 2005 ). However, current varia- tion in income inequality fully accounts for any cultural difference in homicide rates between the northern and southern states (Daly& Wilson 2010 ). Similarly, behavioral differences between collec- tivist and individualist cultures are supposedly maintained by inter- nalized social norms and beliefs (e.g., Markus & Kitayama 1991 ), yet these differences can disappear when the expectations of the different cultural groups are matched (Yamagishi et al. 2008 ). Richerson et al. wave away alternative explanations by toppling a straw-man of \"evoked culture \"that they readily admit no one holdsand by relegating as \"narrow \"the interpretation of experimental research. They also ignore the fact that CGS explains geneticallydetrimental helping by invoking the \"mistakes \"of an adaptive learning mechanism (Barclay & Van Vugt 2015 ). More generally, the study of cooperation has long been hindered by confusion between proximate and ultimate causation (Barclay 2012 ; West et al. 2011 ), and we can now add to the list a persistent confusion over the utility of the group selection concept itself. We look forward to future work on CGS that convincingly demonstrates both the causal relationship between group traits and group tness and the transmission of these traits by cultural means. The cooperative breeding perspective helps in pinning down when uniquely humanevolutionary processes are necessary doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000072, e34 Judith Maria Burkart and Carel P. van Schaik and Museum, University of Zurich. Judith.Burkart@aim.uzh.ch vschaik@aim.uzh.ch www.aim.uzh.ch Abstract: The cultural group selection (CGS) approach provides a compelling explanation for recent changes in human societies, but hastrouble explaining why our ancestors, rather than any other great ape,evolved into a hyper-cooperative niche. The cooperative breeding hypothesis can plug this gap and thus complement CGS, because recent comparative evidence suggests that it promoted proactive prosociality,social transmission, and communication in Pleistocene hominins. Richerson et al. address two key changes in human evolution, the rst being how cooperation could evolve in the small-scale Pleisto- cene societies of prehistoric times, and the second being how these small-scale societies successfully evolved into much larger and more complex societies during the Holocene. The authors 'case for a role of cultural group selection (CGS) in the second transition is strong. However, we will argue that the adoption of cooperative breeding suf ces to explain the origin of human hyper-cooperation in early forager societies, as it resulted in increased prosociality and social transmission and favored the emergence of language. Richerson et al. mention cooperative breeding as a possible trigger of the process involving CGS, but argue that this alterna- tive hypothesis is dif cult to test independently. However, recent comparative work exploring the psychological and cogni- tive consequences of cooperative breeding in nonhuman primates now increasingly allows us to identify general patterns that reliably emerge whenever a primate species adopts cooperative breeding. It is thus most parsimonious to assume that such psychological and Figure 1 (Burkart & van Schaik). The relationship between allomaternal care and (A) proactive prosociality and (B) social tolerance.

Together, these conse- quences are likely to have paved the way for the emergence of CGS processes (van Schaik & Burkart 2010 ). Proactive prosociality. The rst and perhaps most important consequence of cooperative breeding is that it leads to higherlevels of proactive prosociality at the group level. To test this, we used the group service paradigm, in which an individual can provide food to other group members without receiving anyfood itself, and applied it to 24 groups of 15 species of nonhuman primates (Burkart et al. 2014). The results ( Fig. 1A ) show that the extent of allomaternal care directed at immatures is the best pre- dictor of experimentally assessed proactive prosociality within a group, far better in fact than any other factor proposed so far, in-cluding brain size, social tolerance, cooperative hunting, or the presence of strong social bonds. Most importantly, humans per- fectly t the nonhuman primate regression, suggesting that we do not need a special explanation for our proactive prosociality. Social transmission. Cooperatively breeding primates, the calli- trichid monkeys, consistently show enhanced performance in social learning tasks (Burkart & van Schaik 2010 ; Snowdon 2001 ) compared to their independently breeding sister taxa, most likely due to their high social tolerance (Coussi-Korbel & Fragaszy 1995 ), which, like proactive prosociality, demonstrably increases with increasing levels of allomaternal care across pri- mates ( Fig. 1B) . Indeed, callitrichid monkeys not only show high levels of social learning, but also the best evidence for teach- ing among nonhuman primates comes from callitrichids (Dell '- Mour et al. 2009 ; Humle & Snowdon 2008 ; Rapaport 2011 ), and not from the intelligent, yet independently breeding great apes (Boesch 1991 ; Humle et al. 2009 ; Lonsdorf 2006 ). Among non-primates, teaching is similarly over-represented in coopera-tively breeding species (Byrne & Rapaport 2011 ; Kline 2015 ). Communication and language. Callitrichids also show remark- ably complex vocal communication (Rukstalis et al. 2003 ; Zuber- b\u00fchler 2012 ), with large vocal repertoires and unusual levels of vocal learning, both as immatures (including babbling) and asadults, as well as vocal control (Roy et al. 2011 ; Snowdon 2013 ). Intriguingly, and re flecting their prosocial attitude, cooperatively breeding monkeys regularly use food-offering calls (Vitale et al. 2003 ) and cooperative vocal communication (Takahashi et al. 2013 ), in that they take turns in extended sequences of call ex- changes that are based on conversation rules strikingly similar to those used by humans (Stivers et al. 2009 ). Notably, apes altogeth- er lack communicative turn taking. Information donation (in the form of functionally referential food calls, teaching, or vocal coop- eration; Takahashi et al. 2013 ) is thus over-represented in cooper- atively breeding primates compared to independently breeding ones. It is the basis for language, which explains why apes, who possess most basic cognitive requirements for language butlargely lack this prosocial motivation (Tomasello 2007 ), never evolved language. These broad evolutionary trends can explain why human psy- chology became different from that of the other great apes: Alone among great apes, our ancestors started to rear their off-spring cooperatively. Extensive allomaternal care is a better expla- nation than the other source of human cooperation, male bonding and the resulting cooperative hunting and indirect reciprocity in food sharing, because in other male-bonded or cooperatively hunting species, we do not see similar prosocial tendencies,unless they also are cooperative breeders (Burkart et al. 2009 ; Burkart & van Schaik 2010 ). In sum, comparative evidence supports the idea that coopera- tive breeding installed in our ancestors the psychological predis- positions that functioned as the pre-adaptive substrate uponwhich CGS could eventually be built: the design for group func- tion (language -see target article, sect. 6.1) and mechanisms maintaining intergroup variation (social learning -sect. 2; proso- ciality -sect. 6.3). This argument enhances the plausibility ofCGS in the Holocene transition. First, without this foundation, CGS has a circularity problem. High- delity, low-cost signaling had to evolve rst in order to allow gene-culture coevolutionary processes to install a more prosocial psychology, which in turn would have paved the way for high- delity, low-cost signaling and eventually language. Second, the adoption of cooperative breeding offers a plausible explanation for why our ancestors,but none of the other great apes, took this extraordinary trajecto- ry. Thus, regardless of whether CGS is needed to explain the Ho- locene transition to large-scale societies, cooperative breeding isnecessary to explain its operation in the rst place.

Cooperation and culture began -and begins -in mother -infant interaction. Richerson et al. \"do not see how any of the alternatives to CGS can easily account for the institutionalized cooperation that character-izes human societies \"(target article, sect. 7, para. 2). While they make a solid case for the role of cultural group selection (CGS) in human evolution and history, we think it is the evolution ofhuman cooperation that made the tribal social instincts and CGS possible in the rst place, and that this occurred much earlier than the authors think. To explain, we refer to Weingarten and Chisholm 's(2009 ) use of Bowlby 's(1946 ) insight that \"the psychological problem of ensuring persistent co-operative behav-iour\"(p. 62) in groups was solved by the evolution of the capacity of infants to develop, rst, an attachment to (a powerful emotional valuation of) mothers and others, then, as they mature, to groups of others, group leaders, and group \"policy \"(i.e., belief/value system; Bowlby made speci c reference to the cohesion, cooper- ation, and altruism of combat units in WWII). From the perspective of attachment theory -and infants - everyone 'srst group, tribe, society, institution, ethnolinguistic unit, and culture is the mother -infant group. (By mother we mean \"mother and/or others who act like mothers. \") Everyone 's rst experience of cooperation is in the resolution (or not) of parent -offspring con flict (Chisholm 2003 ). Because selection op- erates only on phenotypes, and phenotypes must develop before they are exposed to selection, we are skeptical of models of the evolution of cooperation that attribute tness bene ts to adults only. How did our adult ancestors learn to cooperate? What mo- tivated them to cooperate? Richerson et al. have little use for what they call \"trigger hypoth- eses\"for the evolution of cooperation because they are dif cult to test and \"even the most innatist theories [of language, for example] imagine a culture-led gene-culture coevolutionary process. \"We have little use for them because they are all about the behavior of adults -but do imagine a mother -infant culture-ledCommentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 23http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59coevolutionary process that set the stage for CGS. Like Richerson et al., we do not think that kin selection and reciprocity are suf- cient to explain large-scale cooperation, but again, think they can explain where our cooperative motivations came from and how they were exposed to selection -because many of the \"mechanisms that maintain intergroup variation \"are already part of the attach- ment process. To wit, infants are capable of accurate, rapid,social learning; infants conform their behavior to their mothers ' behavior; the infant -mother group is a moral community, based on trust (security) and norms of interaction, and infants andmothers punish each other for \"deviant \"behavior with resistance, displays of anger, withdrawal, and so forth; infants learn dispro- portionately from their mothers; engage in \"dances and similar motor rituals \"with their mothers (Beebe & Lachmann 2014 ; Trevarthen 2007 ;T r o n i c k 2007 ). Moreover, oxytocin and subcortical brain systems subserve both infant and adult attach- ment behavior (Lane et al. 2013 ; Nelson & Panksepp 1998 ; Schore 2013 ;S t r a t h e a r n 2011 ) and trust in experimental games played by adults (Baumgartner et al. 2008 ; Kosfeld et al. 2005 ). The basic mammalian social emotions (Panksepp 2011 ) provide the utility function -emotional costs and bene ts-guiding human choice, by infants in the attachment process and adults in cooperation with each other. Because there is no point in thinking unless one already has some- thing of value to think about, the basic mammalian, \"bottom-up, \" subcortical emotions have also been implicated in the development of\"top-down, \"neocortical thinking (Damasio 1994 ;1999 ), of which theory mind is an early example. Theory of mind -and related con- structs like intersubjectivity (Trevarthen 2011 )a n d \"time travel \" (Suddendorf 2013 )-enables infants to learn through (not just from) mothers by inferring (thinking about) their mothers 'beliefs, desires, and intentions/actions in order to \"choose \"their own next action on the basis of their innate value system, the basic mammalian social emotions. Theory of mind is the beginning of culture -shared or\"we\"understanding/intentionality (Tomasello et al. 2005 ). It also varies as a function of attachment security (Fonagy & Target 1997 ; Fonagy et al. 2007 ; Meins et al. 2002 ). As Hobson ( 2004 ,p .9 4 ) put it, \"symbolizing, language and thought are possible only because of the nature of the emotional connection between one person and another, and because of each person 'si n v o l v e m e n t with a shared world. \"The cultural origin of human cognition is in the co-construction of meaning by mother and infant. We thereforepartly disagree with Richerson et al. 's statement that \"Perhaps the earliest cultural norms merely solidi ed the bonds of kinship and reciprocity that were evolving through participation in systems of co- operative breeding \"(sect. 2.2, para. 2). (Again, how did kin and co- operative breeders learn to cooperate? What made them want to?)We think the earliest cultural norms evolved through mother -infant cooperation. This brings us to \"docility, \"one of Richerson et al. 's\"trigger hy- potheses \":\"Docile individuals more inclined to conform to norms would nd it easier to enter larger, more norm-bound groups \" (sect. 2.2, para. 3). If \"docile \"means less fearful and aggressive, we entirely agree, for two reasons. First, secure attachment is asso- ciated with less fear and aggression (Cassidy 2008 ;F e a r o ne ta l . 2010 ). Second, the Russian farm fox studies (Belyaev et al. 1985 ; Trut 1999 )s h o wt h a ta r t i cial selection for \"tameness \"(reduced fear/aggression) succeeded, not because \"genes for \"tameness were selected, but because of the delayed development of fearful/ aggressive behavior in tame strains compared to non-selected, wild strains. As a correlated by-product, the \"docile \"strains also showed increased social-cognitive ). Wein- garten and Chisholm ( 2009 ) proposed that the evolution of delayed development in humans might have had the same effect, po- tentially explaining how human adults came to be (relatively) docile. In conclusion, we believe that the tribal social instincts and CGS were important very early in human evolution as our infant ancestors evolved the enhanced social-cognitive skills(theory of mind) that enabled them to \"bargain and negotiate \"their way through parent -offspring con flict. The outcome, every- one'srst culture -mother -infant culture -repeated in every mother -infant group for hundreds of thousands of years, resulted in culture-led, gene-culture coevolution, and CGS. We are thus inclined to agree with Ayala ( 2010 ): Complex cumulative culture may well be an exaptation. Intergroup competition may not be needed for shaping group cooperation and cultural groupselection doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000096, e36 Carsten K. W. De Dreuaand Daniel Ballietb aDepartment of Psychology, and Center for Experimental Economics and Political Decision Making (CREED), University of Amsterdam, Weesperplein 4, 1018 XA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands;bDepartment of Social and Organizational Psychology, VU University Amsterdam, 1081 BT, Amsterdam,The Netherlands. c.k.w.dedreu@uva.nl d.p.balliet@vu.nl Abstract: Because intergroup interactions often are mixed-motive rather than strictly zero-sum, groups often negotiate settlements that enable both cultures to thrive. Moreover, group prosperity rests on in-group love (rather than out-group hate) that emerges also absent intergroupcompetition or comparison. It follows that cultural group selection(CGS) re flects group effectiveness in organizing in-group trust and cooperation, rather than winning (in)direct intergroup competitions. Richerson et al. have identi edve conditions for cultural group selection (CGS) to be considered as a viable possibility to explain cultural variation across groups and societies. One such condi- tion is intergroup competition: \"while modern nations and the subgroups ...differ in many ways from ancestral tribes, they rest on the innate foundations that evolved from competition between ethnolinguistic units \"(sect. 2, para. 2), and \"the success and failure of groups in such competitions is often deter- mined by institutional and other cultural differences \"(sect. 7, para. 1). The authors reason that intergroup competition for scarce resources such as cattle and territory, market share, or re- ligious supporters motivates within-group cooperation, andcreates cultural practices and culture-speci c institutions. Inter- group competition allows some tribes, rms, or religions to survive and prosper, while others are marginalized. Ultimately, cultural norms and institutions are thought to provide selection pressures for genetic adaptations for social behavior, includingparochial altruism. Here we question the importance of intergroup competition in CGS and culture-led genetic evolution of adaptations for pro- social behavior. First, we take issue with the tendency in evolutionary theory in general, and in CGS in particular, to con-ceptualize intergroup competition as a one-dimensional and zero-sum game. Similar to inter-individual interactions (Deutsch 1973 ; Schelling 1960 ), intergroup competition can vary in the degree of corresponding versus non-corresponding interests (Bornstein 2003 ). In fact, CGS relies on variable-sum Prisoner 's Dilemma game and Ultimatum Bargaining games when testing (parts of) CGS theory (Bowles & Gintis 2011 ; Hagen & Hammer- stein 2006 ; Henrich 2004 ). Furthermore, intergroup competition often is multi-dimensional so that losses on one issue can be, and often are, offset by gains on another issue (Aaldering & De Dreu 2012 ; De Dreu & Carnevale 2003 ). Accordingly, there are many alternative solutions to intergroup competition than \"winner- takes-all, \"including leaving the scene (withdrawal from the battle- eld, entering a different market), or negotiating a settlement (De Dreu 2010 ; Pruitt & Rubin 1986 ). Indeed, tribes and small-scale societies not only raid but also trade (Horan et al. 2005 ),rms merge much more often through negotiated deals than through hostile take-overs (Martynova & Renneboog 2008 ), and disputesCommentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 24 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59between countries may involve some hostilities and barbed-wired fences, but rarely lead to warfare (Jones et al. 1996 ). Thus, inter- group interactions often involve some corresponding interests and can and are settled peacefully through negotiated deals that allow both sides, and their respective cultures, to survive and prosper. As such, it is dif cult to see whether and how intergroup competi- tion is, or has been, a powerful selective pressure on the evolutionof group culture, and hence, culture-led genetic evolution. Second, Richerson et al. suggest that this intergroup competi- tion and CGS could explain cultural and genetic adaptations forparochial cooperation. While it is unclear exactly what types of ad- aptations can be hypothesized to exist via culture-led gene-culture coevolution, research on the proximate mechanisms underlying group cooperation does not seem to contain the footprint of inter- group competition as a strong selection pressure shaping groupcooperation. Social psychology has discovered that parochial altru- ism can be motivated by both in-group love and out-group hate (Brewer 1999 ; Greenwald & Pettigrew 2014 ). In-group love refers to the tendency to sacri ce immediate self-interest to bene t the in-group and its members; out-group hate refers to the tendency to sacri ce immediate self-interest to harm, dero- gate, and aggress competing out-groups and their members (Allport 1954 ; Brewer 1999 ; De Dreu et al. 2014 ). In-group love and out-group hate are conceptually and empirically dis- tinct -in intergroup competition, humans may be motivated by in-group love, by out-group hate, or by some combination of both (De Dreu et al. 2014 ). Absent intergroup competition, or even the presence of other groups, humans may still be motivated by in-group love but, obviously, not by out-group hate. Intergroup competition is but one of the many drivers of in-group love. Moreover, a meta-analysis of studies using cooperation games in psychology, economics, and sociology revealed robust inter- group discrimination in cooperation being due to in-group loverather than out-group hate (Balliet et al. 2014 ). Rivaling out- groups were treated the same way as unfamiliar strangers, sug- gesting that for cooperation it matters whether someone belongs to one 's own group or not. Indeed, intergroup competi- tion strengthens in-group love rather than out-group hate(Halevy et al. 2008 ;2012 ), both among adults (De Dreu et al. 2014 ; Halevy et al. 2008 ) and young children (Buttelmann & B\u00f6hm 2014 ). In fact, oxytocin, an evolutionary ancient neuropep- tide pivotal in social bonding, modulates in-group love rather than out-group hate (De Dreu et al. 2010 ;2011 ; Shalvi & De Dreu 2014 ). Thus, in-group love can emerge both in the pres- ence and absence of intergroup competition, and intergroup competition motivates in-group love more than out-group hate. Accordingly, there is substantial room for negotiated settlements and peaceful coexistence of (culturally) different groups and so-cieties, especially when between group interactions are multi-di- mensional and variable-sum. Third and nally, intergroup competition may not be necessary to explain the (genetic) evolution of psychological adaptations sup- porting (parochial) cooperation. For example, group membership can be a cue that another person is part of an individual 's social network and people may cooperate with in-group members to in- crease their reputation to gain indirect bene ts from others and avoid being excluded from the group. Intergroup competition, or even intergroup comparisons, are not needed to bring about these processes (see Balliet et al. 2014 ; Yamagishi et al. 1999 ). Ac- cordingly, a more parsimonious and empirically more valid per- spective may be that cultural group selection is the outcome ofindividuals and their groups seeking to survive and prosper, and who, therefore, create norms and cultural practices that sustain and promote biologically prepared tendencies for in-group love. Some groups properly adapt to a changing environment (the en- trance of competing out-groups included), and others are lessable to adapt to changes in the environment (crop failures and earthquakes included). Whether exogenous pressures are social or non-social in nature, groups that organize and sustain in-group love survive, prosper, and spread, and with them theirculture. In short, in-group love, not intergroup competition, is driving cultural group selection. Human evolutionary history and contemporary evolutionary theory provide insight whenassessing cultural group selection doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000102, e37 Agustin Fuentes and Marc Kissel Department of Anthropology, University of Notre Dame, Notre 46556. afuentes@nd.edu mkissel@nd.edu http://anthropology.nd.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty-by-alpha/agustin- fuentes/http://anthropology.nd.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty-by-alpha/marc- kissel/ Abstract: Richerson et al. provide a much needed roadmap for assessing cultural group selection (CGS) theory and for applying it to understandingvariation between contemporary human groups. However, the currentproposal lacks connection to relevant evidence from the human evolutionary record and requires a better integration with contemporary evolutionary theory. The article also misapplies the F ststatistic. We agree that cultural group selection (CGS) has been under-the- orized and applaud the attempt to develop a more formalizedframework. However, there are two areas where the current effort falls short. The rst is the lack of engagement with research on the development of complex cooperation and shared intention- ality in our evolutionary history. The second area is twofold and in- volves the lack of explicit connection to many processes in theExtended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES; e.g., Laland et al. 2014 ; 2015 ), most of which can assist in developing robust CGS argu- ments. Richerson et al. also measure and describe cultural variation and culture groups, the key elements in CGS, using radically differ- ent, and often non-compatible, scales and de nitions, relying on a weak analogy use of the F ststatistic. These flaws undermine the strength of the argument, but are not lethal and can be corrected. Richerson et al. seek support for their assertions with data from contemporary psychology, ecology, economics, and cultural anthro- pology, but do so without providing engagement with the evidence for when or how human cooperation began, data that exist in the archaeological and fossil record. The drive toward complex cooper- ation and the incipient patterns of CGS are signi cantly older than suggested in the target article. There is evidence of complexity in cooperative behaviors deep in Hominoid (ape) history and complex cooperation between non-kin individuals is part of an adaptive complex that predates the appearance of the genus Homo (Herrmann et al. 2007 ; MacKinnon & Fuentes 2011 ; Malone et al. 2012 ). In order to most effectively contextualize the emergence and role of CGS in the genus Homo ,w em u s t examine the Pleistocene evolutionary and archaeological record, which provides material evidence that can support these claims. The patterns and processes invoked in explaining CGS requirethat we have a working knowledge of the material, behavior, and ecological features of the expansive human niche across the Pleisto- cene. Recent work (Andersson et al. 2014 ;F u e n t e s 2015 ; Grove & Coward 2008 ; Sterelny & Hiscock 2014 ; Stout 2012 ;W h i t e n& Erdal 2012 ) demonstrates that symbol-making and socio-cognitive niche construction played a key role in our lineage 'ss u c c e s si n the terminal Pleistocene and is directly relevant to understanding the evolutionary landscape of interactions within and betweenhuman groups. This lack of engagement (there are only a few par- agraphs with scant citations) represents a missed opportunity to demonstrate the evolutionary history and processes central in de- veloping the capacity for, and effects of, CGS across the evolution of the genus Homo . Combining the material record, nicheCommentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 25http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59construction theory, and paleoanthropological data sets creates a key venue to test the theories presented in the article. For example, there is archaeological evidence for symbol con- struction, formation, and use that predates the appearance of Homo sapiens (circa 200,000 years ago). Initial results from our broad-scale assessment of these data indicate support for Richer- son et al. 's assertion that CGS was active \"as far back as symbolic marking is evident. \"While they suggest symbol-making may go back to 164 k.y.a., there are earlier signs such as the engraved bones from Bilzingsleben (Mania & Mania 1988 ) which may date to 350 k.y.a. Ochre use older than 200 k.y.a has been uncov- ered at sites in Zambia (Clark & Brown 2001 ), Sudan (Peer et al. 2004 ), and the Netherlands (Roebroeks et al. 2012 ), suggesting complex behavior and possible CGS at earlier dates. We suggest that key aspects of CGS emerged previous to identi able symbol-making and then coevolved, via niche construction and se- lection (alongside drift and gene flow), with that capacity to develop a baseline for the radical leaps in complexity in the last 20,000 years that Richerson et al. focus on. While we are supportive of the CGS concept, there is a lack of explicit connectivity to the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES). Despite introducing three forms of cultural group selec- tion, Richerson and colleagues retain a reliance on selection- based processes as the key architect of function. This misses the opportunity to engage with niche construction, evo-devo, pheno-typic plasticity, and other processes in the EES under which \"Or- ganisms are constructed in development, not simply 'programmed 'to develop by genes. Living things do not evolve tot into pre-existing environments, but co-construct and co- evolve with their environments, in the process changing the struc-ture of ecosystems \"(Laland et al. 2014 , p. 162). The processes in the EES, in addition to selection models, and multiple patterns of evolutionarily relevant inheritance (genetic, epigenetic, behavio-ral, and symbolic; e.g., Jablonka & Lamb 2005 ) are central to the development of a more robust CGS approach. The current article does invoke non-genetic inheritance and implicitly uses a form of niche construction but does so without serious connection to the theoretical toolkit available. CGS will be more robust if itwere explicitly connected to the EES. We would be remiss if we did not note that cultural F STdoes not function in the same way as a genetic FSTdoes. FSTmeasures the variation that exists when a metapopulation lives in discrete groups. However, the assumption that responses to one or twoquestions on a survey are analogous to \"one or two loci for a genetic F ST\"is not correct. Variance used to calculate FSTin genetic or morphological contexts are based on physically de nable measurements, but the answers by Saudi and Lebanese citizens to one of two questions about the role of clergy in the politicalsystem are not truly quantitative measures. They are in fluenced by multiple contextual and contingent (and linguistic) cultural variables and cannot be treated as independe nt material measures analogous to the number of alleles at a locus or inter-parietal breadth on a cranium. It is not clear that a cultural F STmeasures what a genetic one does or that such a measure is actually useful for assessing CGS. CGS is relevant and should be incorporated into our under- standing of human evolution, but approaches and analyses needto be rooted in a contemporary evolutionary theory and the ar- chaeological record, be untangled from certain assumptions about selection and tness, and seek models and assessments ap- propriate for cultural processes. Societal threat as a moderator of cultural group selection doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000114, Nau,cJesse Harrington,aYan Mu,aand Joshua Psychology, Maryland, College Park, MD 20742; bMiner & Kasch, 334 Scherer Lane, Severna Park, MD 21146;cDepartment of Computer Science and Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, have rushed to either prove or refute cultural group selection (CGS), the debate lacks suf cient consideration of CGS 's potential moderators. We argue that pressures for CGS are particularlystrong when groups face ecological and human-made threat. Field,experimental, computational, and genetic evidence are presented to substantiate this claim. The debate on cultural group selection (CGS) would be more fruit- ful if it considered the role of human ecology as a critical moderator of CGS. In particular, we argue that ecological and historical threats to human societies strengthen CGS pressures. As we summarize below, there is substantial evidence from eld, experimental, com- putational, and genetic studies suggesting that exposure to threatincreases the strength of social norms and punishment of deviance, which are conditions that Richerson et al. identify as important mechanisms that maintain intergroup variation. Hence, ecologicaland historical threats can critically moderate the strength of CGS pressures and may provide insight into precisely where, when, and to what extent CGS occurs. Field research across 33 nations rst documented the connec- tion between ecological and historical threat and the degree ofnorm strength in groups (Gelfand et al. 2011 ). Ecological and human-made threats were theorized to increase the need for clear rules and coordination for the purpose of survival -whether it is to reduce chaos in nations that have high population density, to effectively deal with resource scarcity, to coordinate in theface of natural disasters, to defend against territorial threats, and/ or to contain the spread of infectious disease. Societies facing these ecological and human challenges therefore develop strong norms and sanctions for deviance (i.e., are tight) to enhance coor- dination and deal effectively with such threats. By contrast, socie-ties with less threat have a lower need for coordination, and hence areloose, that is, have weaker norms and much higher tolerance for deviant behavior. Using archival and survey data, we tested this hy-pothesis across a wide range of variables and found that societies facing ecological and historical threats do indeed develop stronger norms and punishment of deviance (Gelfand et al. 2011 ). Further research con rmed this relationship at the state level in the United States. Harrington and Gelfand ( 2014 ) found that tighter states (e.g., those which have strong norms and punish- ment of deviance) have a greater degree of natural disasters and environmental vulnerabilities, fewer resources (indicated by greater rates of food insecurity), a greater incidence of disease and health vulnerabilities, and perceive a greater degree of exter-nal threat, re flected in the desire for more national defense spend- ing and greater rates of military recruitment, as compared to loose states. (i.e., those which have weaker norms and less punishment of deviance). Individuals in tighter states also had higher levels of conscientiousness -a personality dimension that re flects greater impulse control, cautiousness, desire for orderliness, and confor- mity to norms -and lower openness -a personality dimension that re flects non-traditional values and beliefs, interest and curios- ity toward new ideas, and tolerance for other cultures (John et al. 2008 ). Tighter states also had signi cantly lower residential mobil- ity and supported more isolationist policies (such as buying Amer- ican products exclusively and supporting government restriction of imported products) compared to loose states.Commentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 26 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59Beyond these correlational results, evolutionary game theoret- ical (EGT) models show that groups that face a high degree ofthreat require stronger norms and greater punishment of deviance in order to survive (Roos et al. 2015 ). Following existing EGT models (Hilbe & Traulsen 2012 ; Roos et al. 2014 ), we examined the evolution of strategies for cooperation as well as strategies for a subsequent punishment phase in cooperation and coordina-tion games. We found that exposing populations to higher degrees of threat -implemented through lower base-rate payoffs -led to an increase in the survival of agents that adhered to the coopera-tion or coordination norm and those that punished norm-deviating behaviors. Under low threat, the evolutionary pressures resulted in a more diverse mix of all possible strategies. Besides showing that strong norms and punishment of deviance emerges under chronic levels of high threat, these models also found that tempo-rary increases in threat cause norm strength to increase until the threat subsides. Given that conformity and punishment are impor- tant pressures for CGS (per Richerson et al.), it follows that in- creases in ecological and historical threat contribute to the conditions for CGS to occur. Our electroencephalography work has also found neurobiolog- ical differences in the detection of deviant behaviors among tight and loose groups (Mu et al. 2015 ). Chinese samples, which report- ed higher degrees of territorial threats, had stronger neurological responses (e.g., greater N400) in the frontal region when viewingsocial norms violations (e.g., Bob is in the library, he is shouting as compared to Bob is in the library he is studying) in comparison with U.S. samples. Moreover, stronger N400 responses mediated cultural differences in a number of attitudes and behaviors, in- cluding higher self-control and ethnocentrism, but lower creativ-ity, among Chinese as compared to U.S. groups. More generally, pronounced neural reactions to norm violations should enable groups to enforce social norms and punish deviant behavior,which, according Richerson et al., should further enhance intra- group cohesion and intergroup variation. Relatedly, using genetic data, Mrazek et al. ( 2013 ) argue that higher frequencies of short (S) allele in the 5-HTTLPR polymor- phism of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) persist inregions of the world prone to ecological threat because heightened threat sensitivity may be adaptive in such regions. Because the S allele has been associated with more aversive reactions to moral violations in groups, they suggest that threat-driven genetic variance in the S allele may underlie differences in moral attitudes acrosscultures. Their path model linking ecological threat, genetic vari- ability of the S allele, the strength of social norms, and reactions to moral violations provides plausible evidence for this argument. In sum, as scholars have rushed to either prove or refute cultur- al group selection, few have explored it as a phenomenon that ismodi ed by the ecological and historical contexts in which human groups are embedded. Considering the role of societal threat in theories of CGS could help resolve the debate ofwhere, to what extent, and how CGS occurs. A framework for modeling human evolution doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000126, e39 Herbert Gintis Santa Fe Institute, 1399 Culture-led gene-culture coevolution is a framework within which substantive explanations of human evolution must be located. It isnot itself an explanation. Explanations depend on such concrete historical evolutionary factors such as the control of re, collective child-rearing, lethal weapon technology, altruistic cooperation and punishment, and the mastery of complex collaboration protocols leading to an effective division of social labor. The target article nicely elaborates the strong relationship between cultural group selection and gene-culture coevolution. Richerson et al. correctly observe that gene-culture coevolution signicantly strengthens genetic group selection models. However, there really are no purely genetic group selection models in the literature. All such models employ the phenotypic gambit (Grafen 1984 ), in which complex transmission processes are treated as though they were the product of a single allele of the genome. Such models represent equally any transmission process, cultural, genetic, or interaction between the two, that depend only on vertical transmission from parents to offspring(Gintis 2014 ). The target article 's contention that cultural group selection is \"a basic explanation for our species 'highly unusual ability to create large societies with widespread cooperation between non-rela- tives\"(sect. 7, para. 2) is incorrect. Cultural group selection is not an explanation of anything. Rather, it is a framework within which such an explanation can fruitfully be developed. The main features of human cooperation, which include collectivechild-rearing without a reproductive division of labor (Hrdy 2000 ; Wilson 2012 ), hunting large game with lethal weapons (Wrangham & Carmody 2010 ), altruistic cooperation and punish- ment (Bowles & Gintis 2011 ), as well as collaborative skills de- pending on a theory of mind (Tomasello 2008 ), follow from the particular evolutionary history of our species. Curiously, the authors suggest that there is evidence for culture-led gene-culture coevolution only \"for a few simple genetic traits \"(sect. 2.2, para. 6). In fact, there is overwhelming evidence for this process as central to the constitution of Homo sapiens , a few pieces of which I will cite here. Human Self-domestication: Darwin noticed that selective breeding of mammals for tameness entailed a pattern of similarside-effects of domestication to human society in distinct species. Darwin even suggested that, \"Man in many respects may be compared with those animals which have been long do-mesticated \"(Darwin 1871 corrob- orated this insight, studying captive silver foxes bred for tameness. These animals developed humanly attractive faces with short snouts, floppy ears, patches of white fur on their heads, and curly tails (Gibbons 2014 ). More recently, Cieri et al. ( 2014 ) doc- umented domesticated syndrome changes in human evolution since the Middle Stone Age and Upper Paleolithic, and Wilkins et al. ( 2014 ) have proposed a general genetic model explaining the domestication phenomenon. This is evidence for a very straightforward culture-led group se- lection mechanism in which an increasingly complex division of labor and social norms that rewarded cooperation (Tomasello 2014 ) favored genetic changes that produced a more domesticat- ed and prosocial human disposition. Control of Fire and the Reorganization of the Human Upper Torso: Prior to the control of re, hominins inhabited trees at night as a defense against predators. Because predators have an instinctive fear of re, the control of re permitted hominins, who were already bipedal, to abandon climbing almost completely (Wrangham & Carmody 2010 ). The lack of need for brachiation freed the hand, arms, and shoulders of proto-humans to evolve for other purposes (Gintis et al. 2015 ). Lethal Weapons and the Physiology of Throwing: Hominins de- veloped the use of long-range projectile weaponry, and such tech- niques were central to human social life (Bingham 1999 ; Wilkins et al. 2012 ). Humans are unique in possessing the neural machin- ery for rapid manual-brachial movements that allows for precision stone-throwing, which depends on the brain 's capacity to orches- trate a series of rapidly changing muscle movements (Calvin 1983 ).Commentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 27http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59Roach et al. ( 2013 ) showed that Homo erectus had already evolved this capacity for accurate overhead throwing. Humans are uniquein possessing a torso musculature optimized for the powerful and accurate throwing of projectile weapons. Language and the Physiology of Communication: The in- creased social importance of communication in human society re- warded genetic changes that facilitate speech. Regions in themotor cortex expanded in early humans to facilitate speech pro- duction. Concurrently, nerves and muscles to the mouth, larynx, and tongue became more numerous to handle the complexitiesof speech (Jurmain et al. 1997 ). Parts of the cerebral cortex, Broca 's and Wernicke 's areas, which do not exist or are relatively small in other primates, are large in humans and permit grammat- ical speech and comprehension (Belin et al. 2000 ; Binder et al. 1997 ). Modern humans have a larynx low in the throat, a position that allows the throat to serve as a resonating chamber capable of a great number of sounds (Relethford 2007 ). The rst hominids that had skeletal structures supporting this laryngeal placementwere the Homo heidelbergensis , who lived from 800,000 to 100,000 years ago. In addition, the production of consonants re- quires a short oral cavity, whereas our nearest primate relatives have much too long an oral cavity for this purpose. The position of the hyoid bone, which is a point of attachment for a tonguemuscle, developed in Homo sapiens in a manner permitting highly precise and flexible tongue movements. How evolved psychological mechanisms empower cultural group selection doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000138, e40 Joseph Henricha,band Robert Boydc aDepartment of Human Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138;bDepartment of Psychology, Department of Economics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada;cSchool of Human Evolution and Social Change, AZ 85287. joseph.henrich@gmail.com robert.t.boyd@gmail.com http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/ henrich/ http://robboyd.abcs.asu.edu/ Abstract: Driven by intergroup competition, social norms, beliefs, and practices can evolve in ways that more effectively tap into a wide variety of evolved psychological mechanisms to foster group-bene cial behavior. The more powerful such evolved mechanisms are, the more effectivelyculture can potentially harness and manipulate them to generate greater phenotypic variation across groups, thereby fueling cultural group selection. Many critics of the approach taken by Richerson et. al. incorrectly believe that evolutionary mechanisms regulating reciprocity, rep- utation, life history, and behavior toward kin necessarily represent alternatives to cultural group selection as explanations for cooper-ative behavior, and that evidence forthese mechanisms consti- tutes evidence against a role for cultural group selection (e.g., Lamba & Mace 2011 ; Pinker 2012 ). To the contrary, intergroup competition will favor those group-bene cial cultural traits -in- cluding social norms, beliefs, and practices -that most effectively inltrate and exploit aspects of our evolved psychology (N. Henrich & Henrich 2007 ; Richerson & Boyd 1999 ). Rituals, religious beliefs, marriage norms, and kinship systems all tapinto how the mind works in different ways, and if these traits vary in ways that in fluence the success of groups in competition, then cultural group selection can shape human social behavior. The following examples illustrate this point. The kinship systems that dominate life in small-scale societies variously harness, extend, and suppress evolved psychological mechanisms for dealing with relatives (Mathew et al. 2013 ). Bybuilding on the intuitions and motivations supplied by our evolved kin psychology, cultural evolution can, for example,spread social norms for treating distant cousins more like genetic siblings, thereby fostering greater cooperation while in- hibiting sex and marriage. Such kinship norms often exploit our proximate kin identi cation mechanisms by in fluencing patterns of residence and daily routines (e.g., who eats together), and label-ing (e.g., calling some cousins \"brothers \"). Incest taboos can acti- vate a proximate mechanism for innate incest aversion by prescribing the co-rearing of cousins in the same extended house-hold. Moreover, third parties readily acquire such norms because they already have compatible intuitions about how others \"should \" behave toward their siblings (J. Henrich 2016 ). Widespread unilineal clan organizations are particularly interest- ing. Though clearly rooted in kin psychology, they devalue half ofone's genealogical relatives in order to foster greater cooperation with the other half. Among foragers in Indonesia, eld studies show that patriclan membership predicts large-scale cooperation in whale hunting better than genealogical kinship (Alvard 2011 ). In Australian foragers, ethno-historical and linguistic reconstruc-tions suggest that patrilineal clan organizations spread only in the last 6,000 years, probably via various forms of intergroup competi- tion (Evans & McConvell 1998 ; J. Henrich 2016 ). Cultural evolution may also empower direct reciprocity (N. Henrich & Henrich 2007 ). Theoretical work (Boyd & Lorder- baum 1987 ) reveals that the success of reciprocating strategies depends on the particular constellation of other strategies present (e.g., see Zefferman [ 2014a ]o nD e l t o ne ta l .[ 2011 ]). The combina- torial explosion of possibilities in this complex multi-dimensional space of possible strategies means that it is unlikely that ajukebox-like psychology could effectively address this challenge. Thus, it is not surprising that outside of humans reciprocity is rare and limited to low cost behaviors (Clutton-Brock 2009 ). Cultural evolution, however, may explain why reciprocity is so powerful in humans (Boyd & Mathew 2015 ; N. Henrich & Henrich 2007 ). Social norms provide shared standards of accept- able behavior, allowing third parties to assist in identifying and punishing defectors. Intergroup competition can favor those socialnorms which maximize the effectiveness of direct reciprocity under particular conditions, and this may help explain why the im- portance of direct reciprocity varies so dramatically among societies (Fiske 1992 ). Thus, it may be cultural evolution that turns direct reciprocity from the flimsy and relatively unimportant meta-strategy that we see in other animals into a powerful force for cooperation. Reputation underpins many models of cooperation (Barclay 2013 ; Panchanathan & Boyd 2004 ). However, such models are in- complete because they leave unspeci ed where the required rep- utational standards come from. Reputational standards areculturally transmitted (Salali et al. 2015 ) and vary dramatically among societies (Bell et al. 2009 ), even among societies facing similar ecological circumstances (Edgerton 1971 ; McElreath 2004 ). Across societies, reputations are in fluenced not only by co- operative actions like contributing to village feasts or leading the charge against the village in the next valley, but also practices like female in bulation, funerary cannibalism, ritual participation, and food taboos. Thus, any explanation that \"reputation explains cooperation \"needs a theory for why reputational standards vary so dramatically among societies, and why group-bene cial behav- iors often generate good reputations. Driven by intergroup compe- tition, cultural evolution may favor some elements of reputational content (e.g., for bravery in warfare) over other elements. Finally, environmental cues may evoke evolved psychological responses that in fluence human sociality. For example, some argue that cues received early in life evoke either a \"fast\"or \"slow\"life history strategy (McCullough et al. 2013 ), with cues of safety, security, and stability favoring \"slow\"life histories, and greater cooperativeness. Building on this, some argue, often in opposition to cultural evolutionary accounts, that such life history switches account for between-group variation inCommentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 28 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59prosociality and the growth of moralizing religions (Baumard et al. 2015 ). However, what 's missed is that such evoked responses are pre- cisely the kind of psychological switches that cultural group selec- tion could harness. If slow life history strategies favor greater cooperation, then cultural group selection will favor sets of norms that stabilize families, provide social safety nets, reducedisease threats, or do whatever most effectively throws the switch in ways that foster success in intergroup competition. The existence of such switches can actually increase the variation among groups in phenotypes , fueling the engine of cultural group selection. The spread of normative monogamous marriage pro- vides an example of an institution that harnesses various evolved mechanisms to increase paternal investment, household related- ness, and infant/child survival while reducing male -male compe- tition (Henrich et al. 2012b ). This culturally evolved package is precisely the kind of institution that could throw the slow life history \"switch \"and magnify the power of cultural group selection. Overall, the existing evidence for the importance of kinship, reciprocity, reputation, and evoked responses for human cooper- ation and sociality contributes to a prima facie case for cultural group selection by providing psychological mechanisms that can be exploited by relatively weak social norms to generate big differ- ences in phenotypes between groups, thereby powering up cultur-al group selection. We urge researchers to consider a more integrative approach, one that synthesizes genetic and cultural evolution. Does cultural group selection explain the evolution of pet-keeping? doi:10.1017/S0140525X1500014X, e41 Harold Herzog Department of Psychology, Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, NC 28723. herzog@email.wcu.eduhttp://paws.wcu.edu/herzog/ Abstract: Pet-keeping is highly variable across cultures in both frequency and form. Cultural group selection offers a plausible explanation for the development and spread of this uniquely human phenomenon in that pet-keeping involves an inheritance system, socially transmitted normsand preferences, substantial between-group variation, and (albeitindirectly) intergroup competition. In the target article, Richerson et al. argue that cultural group se- lection (CGS) was essential for the evolution of the high level of cooperation seen in our species, as well as the development of in-stitutions such as religions and businesses. Here I make the case that CGS also provides a coherent explanation for the evolution of a uniquely human form of social relationships -pet-keeping . Pet-keeping poses an evolutionary problem. There is no evidence that pets increase the reproductive potential of their owners, andthe putative health and psychological bene ts of living with animals are not as well-established as commonly believed (Herzog 2011 ). Maintaining a companion animal can be costly, and devoting affection and resources on members of another species that have no apparent function cannot be explained by kin selection or reciprocity. Several lines of evidence suggest that CGS may have played a role in the emergence and spread of pet-keeping. First, pet-keeping occurs in humans only. While nonhumans occasionally form attachments to members of a different species, these unusual relationships always seem to involve some human inter- vention such as occurs in zoos, wildlife parks, and households (Herzog 2014 ). In completely natural environments, \"animalodd couples \"analogous to pet-keeping are extremely rare and probably non-existent. Nonhuman species do possess prosocialmotivational systems such as parental care and empathy that are prerequisites for the formation of interspeci c attachments (e.g., Preston & De Waal 2002 ). But the fact that long-term affec- tionate relationships between non-conspeci cs have not been ob- served in the wild, even in nonhuman apes, suggests that pet-keeping requires the degree of rapid social learning found only in our species. Second, unlike language, music, and prohibitions against sex with rst-degree relatives, pet-keeping is not a human universal. Indeed, the frequency and form of pet-keeping vary widely among cultures. Indigenous peoples of Amazonia, for example, commonly make pets of captured wild animals such as monkeys and birds. This practice, however, is rare among tribal peoplesof New Guinea (Diamond 1993 ). In some cultures, pet-keeping is unknown, and some languages have no word that corresponds to\"pet.\"Cross-cultural studies reveal that practices common in modern Western societies, such as letting animals live in our homes, allowing them to sleep in our beds, and consideringthem full- fledged family members are cultural anomalies (Gray & Young 2010). Further, social norms governing relationships with pets can shift dramatically over time. In Medieval Europe, cats were routinely subjected to torture and mass slaughter, as they were linked with witchcraft. Their image only began tochange in the mid-17th century, with the complete transformation of the cat from pariah to household pet occurring by the end of the 18th century (Bradshaw 2013 ). Third, preferences for pets are transmitted vertically from parent to child and horizontally across cultural landscapes. Arecent study found that mothers who had pets in their childhood, tended to raise their offspring with pets (Westgarth et al. 2010 ). Sudden shifts in the popularity of types of pets occur across cultur-al groups via social transmission. In the United States, examples include transient enthusiasms for baby turtles, caged songbirds, ferrets, mice, and pot-bellied pigs. Using 60 million American Kennel Club dog registrations between 1926 and 2005 as data, my colleagues and I have shown that shifts in choices for caninecompanions are in fluenced by the mechanisms Richerson et al. propose as sources of intergroup variation. These include rapid social learning, conformity, and the in fluence of prestigious models. We have found that dog breed preferences are in fluenced by the decisions of others (Herzog et al. 2004 ); are unrelated to breed-characteristic qualities such as desirable behavioral traits and frequency of genetic diseases (Ghirlanda et al. 2013 ); and result in fads in which the more quickly a breed becomes popular, the faster its appeal subsequently declines (Acerbi et al. 2012 ; Herzog 2006 ). In addition, long-lasting changes in the popularity of types of dogs are sometimes instigated by media exposure ( lms with canine movie stars) (Ghirlanda et al. 2014 ). In short, pet-keeping follows the laws of fashion. Fourth, while it is unlikely that cultural differences in pet- keeping are the direct result of intergroup competition, competi- tive forces do shape aspects of human -animal interactions that are precursors to affection. The use of hunting dogs varies widely among indigenous peoples of the Neotropics. Dogs substantiallyincrease the success of Mayangna hunters in Nicaragua, and while the Mayangna are not attached to adult dogs, they do name their dogs and play with puppies (Koster 2009 ). The acqui- sition of horses by Apache and Comanche Indians in the 17th century profoundly changed the nature of tribal warfare on theGreat Plains of the United States (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2003 ). Finally, pet-keeping practices are affected by some of the insti- tutions that Richerson et al. believe arose via CGS, for example, religion and businesses. On the multi-ethnic island of Sri Lanka, 79% of Buddhist households include a dog, compared toMuslim households, of which only 4% do (Knobel 2009 ). In the United States, over the last two decades, the proportion of homes with companion animals has increased only slightly whilethe amount of money Americans spend on their pets has risenCommentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 29http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59vefold. It is likely that efforts by industry trade groups such as the Pet Products Manufacturers Association and the American Veter-inary Medical Association to promote the bene ts of pet owner- ship have contributed to the recent cultural trend sometimes referred to as the \"humanization of pets. \" In sum, pet-keeping shows the marks of a cultural group -select- ed institution. It involves an inheritance system, socially transmit-ted norms, a high degree of between-group variation, and (albeit indirect) intergroup competition. Certainly, pet-keeping has evo- lutionary and neurobiological roots (see, e.g., Archer 1997 ; Stoeckel et al. 2014 ). But the large individual and cultural differ- ences observed in attachment to animals suggest that learning and culture play a larger role than biology when it comes to bringing them into our lives. CGS offers an elegant explanation for an im- portant cultural phenomenon that has, until recently, been ne-glected by social and behavioral scientists. Frozen cultural plasticity doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000151, e42 Petr Houdeka,b,cand Julie Novakovab aFaculty of E.

We present evidence that cultural adaptations and theirinfluence on the degree of cooperation may be more complex than presented by Richerson et al., and conclude with the gene-environment- culture relationship and its impacts on cultural group selection. Richerson et al. present compelling evidence for cultural group selection acting as a major constituent of human cooperation; however, we argue that it would be more bene cial to view cultur- al evolution in light of more complex evolutionary models, such as the punctuated equilibrium theory or the frozen plasticity theory (Flegr 2010 ): frequency-dependent selection of cultural norms and, mostly, punctuated equilibrium pattern of cultural evolution (in contrast to the simple gradualist approach in Richerson et al. 's target article). The frozen plasticity framework takes into account the relations between the cultural norms, which are seldom unrelated to eachother (a cultural trait can be a positive norm in one context, but a harmful one in another context). The result could be that the more institutions a culture develops, the more \"frozen \"it becomes as the traits interact, and it becomes increasingly dif cult for any new (better) variant to become established, especially if the culture is isolated. An example of our point consists in thriving Neolithic agricul- tural societies, which formed large and successful autocratic cul-tures, but in which high power inequality and rent-seeking emerged. These factors eventually became barriers to their further development and prevented ef cient cooperation, as the magnitude of relationships between various institutions grew so large that any change would require too large a restructuralizationof the status quo (Olsson & Paik 2013 ). Major institutional changes are likely only after the occurrence of large-scale events or disasters -natural as well as socioeconomic. (An example of this is that, in the aftermath of World War II, Japan ended state Shintoism and hundreds of religious groups sprang up in a veryquick succession; Iannaccone 1998 .) But there is no place for such developments in Richerson et al. 's framework; in theirview, societies implement cooperative norms and irreversibly move toward prosperity. We would like to stress that adjustment toward better-perform- ing norms ( \"cultural plasticity \") is more intricate than Richerson et al. suggest. We show this in the following sections. The unbearable lightness of good institutions. Culture adoption elasticity is highly dependent on the geographical, historical, andintragroup factors and on development of competing cultures, but the direction of in fluence is not straightforward (Acemoglu et al. 2005 ). For example, Europeans were more likely to introduce extractive colonial regimes in relatively richer societies or regions where they could not settle. These regions struggle with poverty now. On the contrary, in relatively poor regions Europeans settled in large numbers and implemented institutions that encour- age prosperity today (Acemoglu et al. 2001 ;2002 ). Richerson et al. would view the story in terms of pure natural selection, but their general theory does not distinguish among factors such as culture and institutions versus human capital (Chanda et al. 2014 ; Glaeser et al. 2004 ) versus genetic diversity (Ashraf & Galor 2013 ;C o o k 2014 ), which co-in fluence intergroup competition. Moreover, similar types of culture originating from one ances- tral culture may choose similar environments to colonize, thereby creating a logically consistent phylogenetic tree while not exclud- ing the evoked culture hypothesis. The character of natural envi- ronment may have in fluenced the relative ability of different cultures to expand and prevail over others; thus institutional var- iation could be only a derivative force in intergroup competition (Spolaore & Wacziarg 2013 ). (Mal)adaptivity of institutions and norms in cooperation. Richerson et al. neglect to stress that some norms can be bene cial on a certain level and harmful on another by moving a culture to the non-cooperative equilibrium. They mention the bene ts of institu- tionalized norms like honor and bravery to intergroup warfare;however, these can act harmfully at the intragroup level. The culture of honor within high castes in India is related to a low degree of coordination (Brooks et al. 2014 ). Norms that had become \"frozen \"may have a detrimental effect in many modern societies, expressed, for instance, in the higherprevalence of antisocial punishment (Kube na et al. 2014 ) in coun- tries whose strong emphasis on traditions may have been bene - cial previously (Gintis 2008 ; Herrmann et al. 2008 ). While some norms could have played an essential role in forming human coop- eration, many likely ceased ful lling this role due to the decreased adaptivity of the trait-network. Important examples of these phe- nomena could be religious norms (Norenzayan et al. 2016 ). Selection forces acting on meta-norms. Richerson et al. estab- lish the government as an intelligent designer. Their examples include patent law and antimonopoly law. However, these traitsare more in accord with our argument that social norms become \"frozen \"in time. They persist largely due to powerful special in- terest groups, even if they become harmful for the society.Patent law in its current form impedes rather than promotes inno- vation (Boldrin & Levine 2008 ), and antimonopoly law is often a tool of adjustment of government politics (Armentano 1986 )o r a product of lobby groups 'pressure. The meta-norms (i.e., norms promoting punishment of defectors and punishment-shirkers alike) are subject to selection as well. Prie- tula and Conway ( 2009 ) note that an established or internalized meta-norm could easily become a \"trap\"and stop being bene cial. Gene-culture coevolution. Genetic diversity has greater effects on comparative development than Richerson et al. admit. Geneticmake-up can in fluence aspects of cultural evolution, which along with resource accessibility may in turn gi ve advantage to bearers of certain genetic markers in a gene-cultur e coevolutionary process, for example, in the interaction of scents and genetic make-up (Havl\u00edc ek & Roberts 2013 ). Loci related to olfaction, immunity, and metabolism (connected to subs istence strategies) are among those most positively selected in recent human history (Akey 2009 ). Conclusion. We fully support cultural selection as the principal explanation for the degree of cooperation among humans (see aCommentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 30 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59contemporary example in our Fig. 1 : North and South Koreans shared the same history and cultural, linguistic, and geographic roots, but institutional differences dramatically diverged the de- velopment of their countries). Nevertheless, we suggest a rigorous analysis of the political and population structure of societies throughout their history to assess whether \"cultural bottlenecks \" and founder effects in fluence the plasticity of cultural traits and can explain human cooperation in greater detail. The sketch is blank: No evidence for an explanatory role for cultural group selection doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000163, e43 Max M. Krasnowaand Andrew W. Deltonb aDepartment of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138; bDepartment of Political Science, College of Business, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4392. krasnow@fas.harvard.edu andrew.delton@stonybrook.edu http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/epl/people/max-krasnow http://andrewdelton.com Abstract: As evidence that cultural group selection has occurred, Richerson et al. simply retrodict that humans use language, punish each other, and have religion. This is a meager empirical haul after 30 years.This contrasts sharply with the adaptationist approach to humanbehavior -evolutionary psychology -which has produced scores of novel, speci c, and empirically con rmed predictions. The adaptationist approach of George Williams ( 1966 ) revolution- ized evolutionary biology. It replaced a loose willingness to assume that every trait of an organism had an evolved function with, instead, a rigorous focus on characterizing adaptations -traits of organisms shaped by natural selection to solve an adaptive problem. Not all traits are adaptations: some are merely incidental by-products of adaptations and need no special adaptive explana- tion. Blood contains adaptations for the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide; its transport properties were crafted by natural se-lection. Its red color when oxygenated is a by-product of its chem- istry and needs no adaptive explanation. In Williams 'words, \"adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should be used only where it is really necessary \"(p. 4). Researchers must carefullytest whether a trait is in fact an adaptation and not recognize ad- aptation in \"purely fortuitous effects \"or invoke natural selection \"to resolve problems that do not exist \"(p. 4). The adaptationist program has been enormously productive: By the 1990s, after 30 years of work, the fruit of this approach already lled textbooks (e.g., Alcock 1998 ; Krebs & Davies 1993 ), and it is now the back- ground assumption of virtually all research in animal behavior (Alcock 2001 ). Williams had a further insight: Selection is most ef cient at the lowest, most faithfully replicating levels in the hierarchy of life. Genes reproduce more faithfully than individuals, who reproduce more faithfully than groups. Thus, adaptions generally arise in the service of transmitting the genes that build them, not in the service of perpetuating the groups where individuals carryingthose genes reside. But, as Williams noted, a herd of fleet deer is also a fleet herd. So, how was fleetness built? Parsimony says that, because genic selection is more powerful, unless herd fleet- ness shows special design that could not be preserved simply by the differential reproduction of speedier deer, group selection isnot doing any explanatory work. Group selection should only be invoked with clear evidence of group-level adaptation , not merely group-level phenomena , an error repeatedly made by the target article. Theories of cultural group selection, gene-culture coevolution, and dual inheritance are now at least 30 years old (e.g., Boyd & Richerson 1985 ). Thus, we think it is fair to question their empir- ical yield. Have these theories made detailed, unique, and novelpredictions con rmed with evidence showing speci cally group- functional adaptation? Or has group-functional adaptation been applied when not necessary to solve problems that do not exist? Our reading of the target article 's section 6 suggests the latter. The best evidence offered for cultural group selection is the ret-rodiction that humans have language, sometimes punish each other, and have religion. There are no novel predictions made by cultural selection theory. (Simply re-describing known facts with the terminology of cultural group selection is not a novel pre- diction.) More critically, no evidence is offered that these traitsarise from cultural group selection; we argue that apparent group-level effects are by-products arising from individual-level bene ts when this alternative is taken seriously. The evoked culture and cognitive niche (a.k.a. improvisational intelligence) hypotheses that Richerson et al. discard are two in-stances of this alternative. Evoked culture hypotheses propose facultative cognitive mechanisms that modulate behavior based on available information (Tooby & Cosmides 1992 ). These Figure 1 (Houdek & Novakova).

This was surelythe case for punishment, as the utility of using coercive power to get one 's way would have ancestrally varied between people (e.g., aggression pays more for the strong; Sell et al. 2009 )a n d between ecologies (e.g., aggression pays more when there are gains it can recruit; Krasnow et al. 2012 ). Cognitive niche hy- potheses propose mechanisms that extract information from the environment and make appropriate inferences (Tooby & DeVore 1987 ). Importantly, these theories are not the straw-men reported in the target article. Why should a mechanism for exploiting the cog- nitive niche rely on solitary innovation when a clearly superior design would also target information in the minds of others? Why should a mechanism for evoked culture be unable tooperate outside the parameter range under which it evolved? Our mechanisms of diet choice gravitate to big macs and cheese- cake despite none existing during our evolutionary history. Although police forces and the rule of law did not exist in Paleo- lithic society, our evolved psychology of personal aggression canbe exploited by these institutions to evoke cultures that never existed before. To the extent that our evolved social psychology is richly articulated, features of this evoked culture can act as further inputs to other facultative mechanisms and evoke further novel cultural features (Tooby & Cosmides 1992 ). Anal note: We are surprised that a paper discussing the tax- onomy of group selection and cultural coevolutionary models can so repeatedly mistake simple cultural change for cultural group selection. There is no dispute that cultures change over time. This is, in fact, the predicted result when creatures exploitingthe cognitive niche leave enduring traces in their societies that evoke new cultures down the line (Pinker 2012 ). But as Williams argued, adaptation is an onerous concept. It is no less onerous forculturally group selected adaptations. The burden has not been met here. In our view, the jury is still out on the explanatory and predic- tive power of cultural group selection theory. Luckily, it is not the only approach on offer. About 30 years ago another theoretical ap-proach emerged as the con fluence of adaptationism and cognitive science: evolutionary psychology (e.g., Daly & Wilson 1988 ; Tooby & Cosmides 1989 ). Although Richerson and colleagues criticize evolutionary psychological approaches, it is evolutionary psychology that has inspired scores of novel, speci c, and empir- ically con rmed predictions. The many empirical successes of evolutionary psychology have lled textbooks, handbooks, and hundreds of journal articles (e.g., Buss 2005 ;2014 ; Buss & Reeve 2003 ). Although cultural group selection theory may yet yield insights, at the moment it is evolutionary psychology thatprovides a generative, testable, and productive framework for un- derstanding the human mind and the cultures it creates. The empirical evidence that does not support cultural group selection models for the evolution of human cooperation doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000175, e44 Shakti Lamba Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College for Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus, Penryn, Cornwall TR10 9FE,United Kingdom. s.lamba@exeter.ac.uk http://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/index.php?web_id=Shakti_Lamba Abstract: I outline key empirical evidence from my research and that of other scholars, testing the role of cultural group selection (CGS) in theevolution of human cooperation, which Richerson et al. failed to mention and which fails to support the CGS hypothesis.Much of my research has focused on seriously testing the cultural group selection (CGS) hypothesis for the evolution of large-scale co-operation in humans as presented by Richerson et al. CGS is an elegant idea that captured my imagination, among those of many others. But a scientist must always remain open to the possibility that even the most elegant of ideas can fail to explain the real world. As Thomas Huxley said, \"the great tragedy o f Science [is] the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact \"(Huxley 1894, p. 244). I agree with Richerson et al. that the issue is not whether coopera- t i o nb a s e do nr e c i p r o c i t ya n di n c l u s i v e tness exists, but rather whether these explanations can account for large-scale cooperation in humans. I also agree that group selection on cultural variation is theoretically pos- sible, but that the extent of variation, heritability, and competition will determine whether it is an empirically important force or not. Richer- son et al. ask, \"Are the norms that underpin institutions among the cul- tural traits so transmitted? Do we observe suf cient variation at the level of groups of considerable size for group selection to be a plausible process? \"(target article, Abstra ct). They state that \"If the answer to one of these questions is 'no,'then we must look to other hypotheses \"(Ab- stract). My research, as well as that of others, suggests that the answerto both these questions may be \"no.\" A series of empirical eld studies I conducted in rural India demonstrate that: (1) individuals do not exhibit a strong tendency to culturally transmit cooperative behaviour (Lamba 2014 ); (2) behavioural variation observed across human groups is at leastin part driven by demographic and ecological processes rather than cultural processes (Lamba & Mace 2011 ;2012 ;2013 ); and (3) individuals are more sel sh in larger populations and less likely to copy increasingly cooperative behaviour (Lamba 2014 ; Lamba & Mace 2011 ). Thus, I have tested the rst two of the three axioms on which CGS is based, that is, cultural heritability, variation, and competition. 1. People do not tend to copy cooperative behaviour. A central assumption of CGS models is that individuals copy the behaviour of others and acquire cooperative strategies via social learning. I tested this assumption across 14 populations of the same society, the Pahari Korwa of India (Lamba 2014 ). A series of public goods games, played with real money and for high stakes,across these populations found little evidence that people used either pay-off biased learning or conformity to copy others 'coop- erative behaviour. The tendency to copy others 'behaviour was highly variable and individuals were less likely to copy more coop- erative strategies, that is, behaviour that bore higher costs bydepositing more money into a group pot. To my knowledge, this is the only quantitative study conducted in real-world populations that tests whether individuals socially transmit cooperative behav- iour, and it suggests that they do not. Hence, the only current quantitative empirical evidence testing whether cooperative be-haviour is culturally transmitted does not support this idea. 2. Behavioural variation across human groups is at least partly driven by demographic and ecological processes. Richerson et al. state that \"it is an empirical matter whether cultural evolutionary processes can maintain substantial between-group variation \"(sect. 2.1, para. 3). They cite studies suggesting that behavioural variation across human groups is driven by corresponding variation in cultural norms of cooperation (Henrich et al. 2004 ;2006 ;H e r r m a n ne ta l . 2008 ). The studies (Henrich et al. 2004 ;2006 ;2010a ;H e r r m a n n et al. 2008 ) administered economic games in up to 16 societies and found that game behaviour varied across them. However, they sampled only one or a few populations per society and therefore did not include population (or village) replicates from each society.Thus, they cannot distinguish whether cultural norms or any of the many other variables that vary between the study populations (e.g., population demographics, habitat variation, climate) cause the ob- served behavioural differences. Building on their work, we adminis- tered public goods games, a naturalistic measure of cooperativebehaviour involving the sharing of salt (Lamba & Mace 2011 ), and ultimatum games (Lamba & Mace 2013 )i nu pt o2 1p o p u l a t i o n s of the same society, the Pahari Korwa of India. For all three mea-sures, we found signi cant and substantial behavioural variationCommentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 32 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59across these multiple populations of the same ethno-linguistic group, and we found that some of this variation was explainedby demographic factors such as population size, age, and sex. Hence, individuals from different villages did not share a common cultural norm of cooperation despite their common ethnicity, and their behaviour varied in response to the demo- graphic and ecological features of their environment. Ourresults are bolstered by similar ndings in other societies (Falk & Zehnder 2013 ; Gurven 2004 ; Gurven et al. 2008 ; Nettle et al. 2011 ; Tognetti et al. 2012 ). Since demographic characteristics of populations are likely to change during indi- viduals 'lifetimes, we may also expect their behaviour to change in response. And if individuals 'cooperativeness is likely to change across their lifetimes, then we should not expect culturally heritable variation in the behaviour ofhuman groups across generations. 3. Individuals are more sel sh in larger populations and less likely to copy increasingly costly cooperative behaviour. We found that individuals took more salt for themselves and left less for others in larger villages (Lamba & Mace 2011 ). Individuals were also less likely to copy more cooperative behaviour (Lamba 2014 ). While CGS models invoke cultural transmission to explain the evolution of large-scale cooperation, empirical data suggest that cultural transmission is less likely as behaviour gets more coop- erative and cooperation is less likely in large populations. In conclusion, if individuals do not copy cooperative behaviour, the behavioural variation between groups is unstable due to the demographic changes that groups experience over time, and behaviour is more sel sh in larger populations, then we must question the existence of stably transmitted cultural norms of co-operation. There is published empirical evidence which Richerson et al. fail to mention, suggesting that the answer to more than one of their questions may be \"no.\"Therefore, by their own admission, we must also look to hypotheses other than CGS. The role of cultural group selection in explaining human cooperation is a hard caseto prove doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000187, e45 Ruth Mace and Antonio S. Silva Department of Anthropology, University College London, London WC1H 0BW, United Kingdom. r.mace@ucl.ac.uk http://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/people/academic_staff/r_mace antonio.silva.09@ucl.ac.ukhttp://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/people/graduate_students/a_silva Abstract: We believe cultural group selection is an elegant theoretical framework to study the evolution of complex human behaviours, including large-scale cooperation. However, the empirical evidence on key theoretical issues -such as levels of within- and between-group variation and effects of intergroup competition -is so far patchy, with no clear case where all the relevant assumptions and predictions of cultural group selection are met, to the exclusion of other explanations. We believe cultural group selection (CGS) is an elegant theoreti- cal framework for studying the evolution of complex human be- haviour. The target article sets out to present evidence that culturally evolutionary processes have resulted in the selectionof large-scale cooperation as a group-level adaptation. However, the empirical evidence presented does, in our opinion, still fail to conclusively demonstrate that CGS explains human coopera- tion better than the competing hypotheses. Variation in cooperative behaviour -frequently measured through economic games -across different cultures (Henrichet al. 2005 ;2006 ;2010a ) is put forward as evidence that coopera- tion is a stable, persistent, and group-level trait on which selectionat the level of the group could act. However, as we and others have argued elsewhere, high levels of variation in cooperative be- haviour are also found within ethnic groups (Lamba & Mace 2011 ; 2012 ; Nettle et al. 2011 ), suggesting that variation attributed to different cultural norms could in fact re flect individual adaptations to different environments. The F STdata presented in the article supports the idea that countries differ in some beliefs and values, so at least one of the assumptions of CGS is met.However the beliefs and values examined are not associated with actual cooperative behaviours; for example, demonstrating that there is signi cant country-level variation in attitudes toward abortion has arguably little relevance to the argument at stake. And has there been enough time for countries to besubject to selection on the basis of this trait? Cultural difference is one of the foundational assumptions of an- thropology, so we should expect to nd it. We agree that institutions are likely to be of particular interest in this eld and the most promising candidates for cultural traits may be thoseclassic subjects of anthropological investigation such as kinship norms, political systems, and religion, which are generally group- level traits, almost by de nition. Religion often has the character- istics of a trait designed for group promotion and cohesion (e.g., costly rituals, apostasy punishment, and clear between-groupdemarcation) making it a strong candidate for spread through in- tergroup competition. Political systems have to be properties of the group rather than the individual, so group selection should be in operation in these cases (Currie & Mace 2009 ; Currie et al 2010 ). Normative marriage and dispersal strategies may only be ef- fective if the rest of your local population shares your understand- ing of the rules; strong frequency-dependent selection could maintain variation between groups, so such traits would also bepromising cases to seek evidence for CGS. While language is a classic frequency-dependent group trait, the exact design of partic- ular languages is not generally considered to confer any particular bene t over any other, therefore it is unlikely that CGS is operating on languages. A key aspect of CGS is the idea that traits that provide an ad- vantage to groups, even if at a cost to the individual, are selected for in a situation of intergroup competition. Our attempts at testing this hypothesis for the evolution of parochial altruism - the combination of in-group altruism and out-group hostilitydue to intergroup competition and con flict-using naturalistic eld experiments in Northern Ireland, found little evidence to support this idea. Individual and neighbourhood exposure to conflict explained a reduction in out-group cooperation, but cru- cially had either no effect or also reduced cooperation toward thein-group. In addition, no signi cant differences in cooperation were found between the two cultural groups when taking into account individual socio-economic characteristics, which in turnbest predicted the variation in cooperative behaviour (Silva & Mace 2014 ;2015 ). Richerson et al. 's article aims to present the evidence in favour of CGS, hence its adversarial approach rather than the more sci- entic approach of falsi cation. However there is still a large em- pirical project to be done in order to identify the domains in which CGS may be an important evolutionary force. Context is likely to be fundamental, as it is in any evolutionary scenario. Different traits will have different patterns of transmission and different selective forces acting upon them, and bene ts may be operation- alized at the level of the individual or of the society, or both. We are at a stage of investigation of this topic where we nd one spe- cic assumption may be met in one case and another assumption may be met for a different trait or in a different kind of a group; but a consistent story showing the wide applicability of CGS to theevolution of large-scale cooperative behaviour is still lacking, other than at an anecdotal level.Commentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 33http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59The I argue that demographic selection, migration, and cultural diffusion, three mechanisms of institutional change, have little in common. Two of these lack the key features associated with groupselection: they do not present us with group-level selection pressurescounteracting individual-level ones, need not produce behavioral altruism, and do not require competition between groups whose members cooperate preferentially with one another. Cultural normsvary, change, and in fluence cooperation; but that is not group selection. I agree with Richerson et al. 's stimulating article on its most im- portant point: Human coalitions and institutions have a long cul- tural history. Their evolution may be driven by three different mechanisms (sect. 2.1.): the differential growth of biological groups; migrations from one group to another; and imitation ofnorms and other institutional arrangements. The authors ' version of cultural group selection (CGS) makes use of all three mechanisms, presenting them as three complementary facets of a uni ed theory. I will argue that they have little in common (see Fig. 1 ). In the rst form of CGS distinguished in the target article, groups are de ned by three overlapping properties: (i) by descent (you are a group member if you are descended from group members); (ii) by preferential cooperation (group members tend to help one another rather than non-members);and (iii) by cultural links (they make use of the same institutional innovations). In this scenario, you cannot vote with your feet by going to a new group and becoming part of it; neither wouldyou help someone who does not share your values, or ght someone who does. When the last two criteria are relaxed, two new types of CGS result. Type 2 CGS is migration, when individ- uals vote with their feet to join the societies that offer them the best deal (Boyd & Richerson 2009 ). Here, groups are de nedby culture and preferential cooperation alone. I am a member of the group of people whose norms I share and whosemembers I choose to cooperate with -even if I was not born there. Finally, in the third form of CGS (selective imitation) pref- erential cooperation must also be dropped, as is obvious from Richerson et al. 's logic and examples. Group members are dened by their common adoption of some institutional innova- tion-that is all: for example, when American rms copy the insti- tutions of German research and development, they do so strictly for their own bene t, not as a way to ally themselves with German industry. One can use CGS to predict, or explain, two very different things: (1) the evolution of altruistic behavior, and (2) equilibrium selection (Andr\u00e9 & Morin 2011 ; Boyd & Richerson 1990 ). Behav- ioral altruism is an uncompensated sacri ce from the individual to the group, with tness consequences. Equilibrium selection is a process that favors the most stable forms of cooperation, including non-altruistic, mutually bene cial cooperation. Migration and im- itation are more likely to work toward equilibrium selection: We can expect people to join the societies, or adopt the institutions,that give them a better deal. Type 1 CGS is more conducive to true altruism, because it short-cuts adaptive individual decisions. Much of the appeal of CGS is due to Type 1 CGS, and to the promise of nding a scienti c rationale for altruism, as a way of backing attacks against standard rational choice theory (Fehr &Fischbacher 2003 ; Sober & Wilson 1999 ). Yet, much of its plausi- bility derives from models of the second type, where mutually protable forms of cooperation spread and no genuine altruism results. The authors 'last two types of CGS, thus, do not seem capable of delivering what CGS is widely thought to explain,namely, altruism (Andr\u00e9 & Morin 2011 ; Morin 2014 ). Tellingly, the authors refrain from making any speci c prediction regarding behavioral altruism (sect. 6.2.). Both Type 2 and Type 3 CGS (migration and imitation) are \"driven by human choices \"(sect. 2, para. 1), as opposed to the rel- atively autonomous demographic dynamics that prevail in Type 1 CGS (birth-rates, wars, etc.). Types 2 and 3 of CGS must, at least occasionally, create group-level selection pressures that are fullyaligned with individual-level selection pressures, and thus undistinguishable from them (unless we assume that human Figure 1 (Morin). Three processes that, for Richerson et al., qualify as \"cultural group selection, \"and my interpretation of the assumptions and consequences behind each.Commentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 34 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59decision-making is so maladaptive as to decreases individual tness systematically). People will vote with their feet: they will join the societies that promise them the best deal. They are likely to adopt institutional innovations that serve everyone 's inter- ests. Indeed, most of the examples cited by Richerson et al. concern mutually bene cial forms of cooperation. One can still use groups as units of accounting, but the causality resides entirelyin individual choices. Contrary to what is stated in section 4.1, CGS is not, then, characterized by group-level selection pressures counteracting individual-level pressures, pushing individuals tosacrice their own tness for the group. The disunity of CGS is deepened by the authors 'inclusion of Type 3 CGS. Cultural diffusion need involve no demographic change, and no change in the composition of coalitions. The manner of cooperation is all that changes. When we use money,majority voting, or the academic practice of research seminars, we are not ipso facto allying ourselves with most of the people who use those practices. A state that decides to allow the legal use of class actions is not forming a coalition with the other states that allow it, or against those that do not. Here, we havesheer equilibrium selection with no differential growth, and no competition between coalitions. Group selection without all this isHamlet without the prince. What is wrong with heterogeneous theories? Science needs lumpers as well as splitters; but to test three very different hypoth-eses as if they were one, is to test only their weakest common denominator. Here, we are left with the uncontroversial view that coalitions or institutions vary and evolve. Richerson et al. 's more substantive suggestion is that useful institutions can only spread through some form of group selection -but to make this point, they dilute the concept of CGS to such an extent that it loses coherence and explanatory heft. Social selection is a powerful explanation for prosociality doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000308, e47 Randolph M. Nesse Center for Evolution and Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-4501. nesse@asu.edu http://RandolphNesse.com Abstract: Cultural group selection helps explain human cooperation, but social selection offers a complementary, more powerful explanation. Justas sexual selection shapes extreme traits that increase matings, socialselection shapes extreme traits that make individuals preferred social partners. Self-interested partner choices create strong and possibly runaway selection for prosocial traits, without requiring group selection,kin selection, or reciprocity. Cultural group selection (CGS) does indeed, as the target article argues, play an important role in explaining human cooperation. However, social selection offers a powerful explanation of extreme human prosociality that contradicts Richerson et al. 's second thesis that only CGS \"can easily account for the institutionalized coopera- tion that characterizes human societies \"(sect. 7, para. 2). The authors document transmissible substantial variations between cultural groups that account for the growth and persis- tence of some human groups at the expense of other groups. Ex- amples from religious groups con rm the theory. The Shakers had 6,000 members in the mid-19th century but the norm of celibacy shrank the group by outmigration and lack of reproduction, so only one small community remains. In contrast, the Catholic Church 's prohibition of birth control fosters group growth. CGS not only occurs, but also it can act on between-group var- iations in cooperativeness to help explain human prosociality. Groups with norms enforcing cooperation tend to expand anddisplace other groups, although, as the target article notes, com- plexities arise because of the costs of cooperating, the costs ofpunishing defectors, and movement of individuals and norms between groups. Nonetheless, CGS offers a plausible explanation for cooperation within groups, and tendencies for con flict between groups. Once established, cultural norms for in-group cooperation create forces of natural selection that give advantagesto individuals with tendencies to learn and conform to those norms, as well as to their groups, in a recursive cycle that gives rise to capacities for complex culture. CGS is not, however, the only plausible explanation for extreme human prosociality, and it does little to explain how the process gets going. Social selection can explain extreme human prosocial traits that CGS cannot. This is not Herbert Simon 's social selec- tion or that of Joan Roughgarden; it is the idea, rst explored in depth in a pair of papers by Mary Jane West-Eberhard, that describe how self-interested social choices create strong selection forces that may account for extreme prosociality and other traits that are otherwise dif cult to explain (West-Eberhard 1979 ; 1983 ; cf. Nesse 2009 ). She de nes social selection in relation to its exemplar and subtype, sexual selection: Sexual selection refers to the subset of social competition in which the resource at stake is mates. And social selection is differential reproduc- tive success (ultimately, differential gene replication) due to differential success in social competition, whatever the resource at stake. (West-Eberhard 1979 , p. 158) Peahen preferences for peacocks with flamboyant tails give a tness advantage to males with extreme traits, and to females who prefer males with extreme traits. Positive feedback between selection for the trait and the preference increases the prevalence of alleles that increase mating success until the tness costs to health and survival outweigh their mating bene ts. West-Eberhard 's core insight was that social selection occurs for competition over resources other than matings. A recent review noted, \"It would have made as much sense for Darwin (and everybody since) to distinguish between selection by choice versus competition rather than on sexual versus non- sexual selection \"(Lyon & Montgomerie 2012 , p. 5). Social selec- tion for competition opens up a whole world of important expla- nations, but partner choice is more important for explaining cooperation. Despite formal models (Frank 2006 ; Tanaka 1996 ; Wolf et al. 1999 ) and detailed descriptions with examples from many species (Flinn & Alexander 2007 ; Lyon & Montgomerie 2012 ; Tobias et al. 2012 ), social selection has been neglected as an explanation for human prosociality. As many have noted, most social exchanges are mutualisms or are readily explained by kin selection or reciprocity. However, some extreme human prosocial traits still need explanation.CGS has a hard time explaining the pervasiveness and intensity of guilt, motivations for reparations, extreme sensitivity to what others think, concern for other 's welfare, pity, commitment, empathy, philanthropy, and pride in generosity. Such traits are, however, expected outcomes from social selection that gives ad- vantages to those preferred as relationship partners or group members. People prefer partners and group members who have plentiful resources that they generously and reliably share (albeit selective- ly) with their partners. Thus, to be preferred as a partner requires striving to get resources and a reputation for sharing them. The tness bene ts are not as direct as increased matings, but they are more pervasive. Day by day, reputations and relationshipsgrow and fade as the result of actions small and large. The most desirable relationship partners pair with each other, and this selec- tive association gives them a selective advantage. As West and col- leagues note in a critique of trait group selection models, \"An alternative is to state as simply as possible what they are - models of nonrandom assortment of altruistic genes \"(West et al. 2007 , p. 11).Commentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 35http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59The bene ts experienced by prosocial individuals, and the ben- ets of preferring such individuals as partners or group members, shape social traits as extreme and costly as a peacock 's tail. This requires no kin selection, reciprocity, group selection, or CGS, al- though all of those phenomena are also involved in selecting for prosocial traits. Social selection has been modeled in economic terms as partner choice that shapes advertisements for generosity (No\u00eb et al. 2001 ) that can become more honest and costly than intended. However, effort invested in carefully assessing partners and making oneself apreferred partner is only the start. Models describing whether to stay or walk away from an existing relationship illustrate how walking away can be inexpensive or even bene cial for the punish- er but devastating to the person punished, ef ciently enforcing social norms (Aktipis 2004 ). Shunning and solitary con nement are cruel for good evolutionary reasons. Careful selection of partners and group members offers little advantage in a species unless differentiated relationships offer a net advantage, some more than others. After a tipping point was reached, however, investments in careful partner choice andtraits that make one a preferred partner could coevolve in a pos- sibly runaway process that may have been crucial in making culture possible (Nesse 2010 ). Social selection may explain how self-interested social choices could have created selection forces by which humans domesticated themselves. Is cultural group selection enough? doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000205, e48 Dwight Read Department of Anthropology and Department of Statistics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095. dread@anthro.ucla.edu https://ucla.academia.edu/DwightRead Abstract: Richerson et al. propose cultural group selection (CGS) as the basis for understanding the evolution of cultural systems. Their proposal does not take into account the nature of cultural idea systems as beingconstituted at an organizational, rather than an individual level. Thesealing partners of the Netsilik Inuit exemplify the problem with their account. Though recognizing that cultural group selection (CGS) \"is not a complete theory of the evolution of cultural variation \"(sect. 2.1, para. 5), Richerson et al. consider CGS to be a major player and list four of its prerequisites. All of these are accepted by most an- thropologists and sociologists because cultural systems, including norms and institutions, are extended across generations throughenculturation, and culture has long been considered to constitute an\"extrasomatic adaptation \"(White 1959 , p. 9), with functional differences the basis for the outcome of competition betweengroups (see, e.g., Evans-Pritchard 's[1940 ] account of the con flict between the Nuer and the Dinka). Similarly, the authors '\"necessary but not suf cient test of the CGS hypothesis, \"namely, that \"social systems of human societies follow a phylogenetic pattern \"(sect. 3.2, para. 1) is easily passed by cultural and social systems. For example, the historical pattern for the appearance and spread of kinship terminologies as part of the colonization of the Paci c Oceanic Islands, rst by Melanesians and then by Polynesians, can be presented as a phy- logeny organized around structural differences in the terminolo-gies (Read 2013 ; see Fig. 1 here). However, these differences do not emerge from changes at the behavioral level assumed by their model of cultural evolution, but are organizational changes. Kinship terminologies, with their algebraic-like structure (Leaf & Read 2012 ; Read 1984 ;2012 ; Read et al. 2014 ) are sym- bolic, computational systems with an underlying, generative logic and no more emergent from behavior than is arithmetic ( contraSmaldino 2014 )-hence, their evolutionary change is at the global level of organization and not the population level of individ-ual traits (see Lane et al. 2009 ). CGS shares with biological group selection the same problem of porous boundaries. If homogenization of between-group traits occurs on a time scale shorter than that needed for the conse- quences of between-group competition to materialize, thengroup competition will be obviated. Biological group competition \"solves \"the porous boundary problem through coupling selection for traits that maintain non-porous boundaries with biologicalgroup competition. In extreme form, this leads to the formation of biological species. The functional equivalent for CGS would be a group-level, cultural system with boundaries resistant to the introduction of competing cultural traits. Consider the cultural adaptation of the Netsilik Inuit of Hudson Bay to Arctic conditions (Balikci 1970 ). Their adaptation included a culturally prescribed system of sealing partners central to pro- curing and sharing seal meat in the winter months. The system of sealing partners was but one of several functionally integrated cultural idea systems (see Leaf & Read 2012 ) that regulated, among other things, female infanticide, post-marital residence, and preferential cousin marriage. Jointly, these idea systems framed the behavioral patterns and modes of social organization Figure 1 (Read). Phylogeny for Polynesian societies based onthe reconstructed sequence of changes in the structural patterns for the sibling kin terms from a sample of the Polynesian kinship terminologies. The speci c patterns, based on attributes associated with the sibling kin terms, are discussed in Read (2013 ).

The Netsilik adaptation centered on three resources: (1) salmon, (2) caribou, and (3) seals. Seals were obtained in the winter months when a seal surfaced in one of the breathing holes it had to keep open in the pack ice in order to breathe. Because there was no way to know which breathing hole a sealwould use, the Netsilik increased substantially their odds of ob- taining a seal by stationing about 20 hunters at different breathing holes. Each hunter had 12 sealing partners in the camp, with eachpartner corresponding to a part of the seal, plus one part of the seal for the hunter and one for his children. When a seal was killed, the hunter 's wife distributed the parts of the seal to the wives of the partners in accordance with the part of the seal rep- resented by a partner. The partners were determined at birth bythe boy 's mother from among distant (cultural) kin -with kin being those recognized by reference through one of their kin terms, such as in the English expression, \"he is my uncle. \" The system of sealing partners expresses the cultural meaning of being a seal hunter and makes the actions of others, ashunters, predictable, hence forming the basis for cooperation among the sealing partners. In this sense their cultural idea system was a social contract to which the Netsilik adhered. The social contract speci ed that a seal, through the act of the hunter, became collectively owned by the hunter and his partners,and only they had rights to the seal. Collective ownership was enacted by distribution of the seal meat, based on another cultural idea system that de ned a man as the procurer of resources and his wife as manager of the resources he procured (Read 2005 ). Accordingly, the seal was butchered by the hunter 's wife and distributed to the wives of the sealing partners. The system of sealing partners was, in effect, the antithesis of sharing through the individual traits of altruism and cooperation since individualbene ts arose through collective ownership and rules of sharing expressed through the social contract. From an evolutionary per- spective, \"it is possible to have a stable social contract for food sharing \"even if \"the food is implicitly owned by every individual who goes hunting \"(Taylor 2014 , p. 71). In their social contract, the Netsilik did not trust a hunter to be altruistic or to voluntarily cooperate, and they instead created an or- ganizational system that depended on neither of these. Cheating, in the sense of opting out of acting in accordance with being a sealing partner, was not a viable option in a context in which individualhunters would likely not survive without averaging hunting risks over a pool of hunters. Consequently, the conceptual boundary for the organization of sealing partners was impervious, given the technologies available to them, to any competing, individual strat- egy. Cultural idea systems like this operate and evolve at an organi-zational, rather than an individual, level with the consequence that \"human sociocultural organizations ...[have] representations, rules, relationships, management processes and function associatedwith these organizations, which are different from, and have vastly more transformative and generative capability than, those at the in- dividual level \"(Lane et al. 2009 ,p .3 5 ) .

However, recent research on spatial patterns of cultural variation demonstrates that, as in the genetic case, apparent groupstructure can be a consequence of geographic clines, not group barriers.Such a pattern limits the scope for cultural group selection. Richerson et al. present a wide-ranging synthesis of evidence for cultural group selection. An innovative feature of their argument is that they draw attention to the importance of quantifying the ap-portionment of cultural variation within and between groups. They calculate F STvalues for 29 aspects of culture between neigh- bouring groups and argue that relatively large cultural FSTvalues provide scope for cultural group selection. In addition, they cite Bell et al. 's(2009 )nding that average cultural FSTvalues (as indexed by responses to the World Values Survey) are greater for neighbouring groups than average genetic FSTvalues as evi- dence that there is greater potential for cultural group selectionthan genetic group selection. While we agree that this framework for quantifying cultural variation holds considerable potential, we challenge Richerson et al. 's interpretation of the existing empirical data. TheF STstatistic belongs to a broad family of \"xation indices \"- statistics developed by population geneticists to study genetic dif- ferentiation between populations (Holsinger & Weir 2009 ). Several studies have demonstrated that human genetic variation is predominantly clinal, with differentiation between populations being strongly predicted by geographic distance across a varietyof biological markers (Handley et al. 2007 ). Discontinuities do exist (typically associated with geographic obstacles), but many ap- parent genetic barriers have proven to be artefacts of heteroge-neous spatial sampling (Handley et al. 2007 ). A clinal pattern of variation is consistent with an \"isolation by distance \"(IBD) model (Wright 1943 ), in which individuals tend to migrate limited distances relative to the total geographic range of the species. Under IBD, a gradual blending of one population intothe next is predicted, rather than group barriers. Nevertheless, two sampling locations can produce signi cant F STvalues simply due to their geographic separation. None of the 29 cultural FSTestimates reported by Richerson et al. or the cultural FSTestimates reported by Bell et al. ( 2009 ) have been analysed within a spatially explicit framework. This renders these estimates dif cult to interpret, since, as in the genetic case, apparent population structure could be an arte- fact of discontinuous spatial sampling, rather than cultural barriers. Recently, we published a study that quanti ed the extent to which geography and group af liation independently predict cul- tural differentiation between ethnolinguistic groups (Ross et al. 2013 ). We used geographic coordinates and coded narrative ele- ments of 700 versions of a folktale from 31 European groups, ana-lysing both individual folktales and group-level differentiation using ST,axation index that is closely related to FST(Holsinger & Weir 2009 ). We found signi cant differentiation between groups with an average STof 0.091, indicating that, on average, 9.1% of the var- iation between individual folktales was between groups, which is considerably higher than the genetic differentiation found between comparable European populations (Lao et al. 2008 ; Novembre et al. 2008 ). However, incorporating geography into the analysis revealed that at the level of individual folktales, geo- graphic distance explains considerably more variation between folk- tales than group boundaries (6.6% of variance vs. 3.7%). Such a pattern of predominantly clinal variation is consistent with IBD-Commentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 37http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59like cultural diffusion processes. This means that geographically close individuals/tales from neighbouring groups tend to be moresimilar than is suggested by the relatively large average cultural ST, thereby limiting the scope for cultural group selection. Two recent studies speak to the generality of our ndings and the FSTestimates from Richerson et al. First, Brown et al. ( 2014 ) exam- ined group-level folk song differentiation among nine indigenousethnolinguistic groups in Taiwan. They found signi cant cultural differentiation between groups. Intriguingly, however, cultural STwas found to be an order of magnitude smaller than genetic STfor the same groups, contra Bell et al. 's(2009 )h y p o t h e s i s that human groups generally show a higher degree of cultural dif- ferentiation than genetic differentiation. This result is particularly pertinent to discussions about human evolution, because the folk song data are drawn from small-scale indigenous societies whoselifestyles and group structure better approximate those of our an- cestors than the large-scale multiethnic nation states studied by Bell et al. ( 2009 ). Second, Shennan et al. ( 2015 ) examined individ- ual level variation and group-level differentiation in two material culture complexes -pottery and personal ornaments -from 361 sites of 22 putative Neolithic cultural groups in Europe. At the level of individual artefacts, cultural af liation was an independent predictor of pottery variation, while geography was not; but both cultural af liation and geography were independent predictors of ornament variation. At the group level, they found signi cant cul- tural differentiation, with geography predicting differentiation in ornaments but not pottery. This result suggests that the relative in fluence of cultural barri- ers and geographic effects can vary across different cultural markers in comparable populations, just as is the case for differentgenetic markers (i.e., autosomal DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and Y-chromosome; Jobling 2012 ). Caution is therefore warranted in making generalizations about the relationships between groupson the basis of analysis of a limited range of cultural traits. While we support the rigorous analysis of empirical data to quan- tify cultural variation, the evidence we present here suggests that cultural differentiation between groups varies considerably across cultural domains and spatial scales and is often best explained interms of geographic clines -a pattern that suggests IBD-like cultur- al processes and limited scope for cultural group selection between neighbours. We note that, in the absence of stable individual level trait differences between neighbouring groups, the most important forms of variation for cultural group selection may be group-leveltraits (Smaldino 2014 ), such as the presence or absence of particu- lar religious or political institutions, rather than the values, stories, songs, or material possessions of individuals. Further work that ex- amines individual variation and group-level differentiation using a geographically explicit framework across the full spectrum ofaspects of human culture is needed. When is the spread of a cultural trait due to cultural group selection? The case of religioussyncretism doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000229, e50 Carlos Santana, Raj Patel, Shereen Chang and Michael Weisberg Department of Philosophy, University of pater@sas.upenn.edu shereenc@sas.upenn.edu weisberg@phil.upenn.edu http://www.phil.upenn.edu/ weisberg/Home.html Abstract: The reproduction of cultural systems in cases where cultural group selection may occur is typically incomplete, with only certain cultural traits being adopted by less successful cultural groups. Why aparticular trait and not another is transmitted might not be explained by cultural group selection. We explore this issue through the case of religious syncretism. Richerson et al. give compelling evidence that the conditions for Darwinian evolution are sometimes met in the case of cultural groups. By presenting evidence for cultural group variation, inher- itance, and selection, the authors succeed in rendering the cultur-al group selection (CGS) hypothesis more plausible, and we agree that CGS may partly explain cooperation and other cultural traits. We remain unconvinced, however, that the evidence demon- strates that CGS is a particularly strong force in cultural evolution because selection mechanisms -conquest, imitation, and migra- tion-frequently do not involve selection between cultural groups, but instead work at the level of individual cultural traits. Consider a case where the conditions favorable to CGS are met: Distinct cultural groups compete, and a group achieves greater success due to cultural variation. According to CGS, we shouldexpect the cultural traits underpinning that group 's success to spread. Presumably, such transmission occurs either by complete assimilation to the successful group or by selective adoption oftraits, with preference for traits speci cally contributing to com- petitive success. Totaltransmissionisrarelythecase.Evenwhenitisclearthatselec- tive conquest, migration, or imitation has occurred, these selective forces rarely involve the total replacement of all the features of theless successful group with all the features of the more successful group. Instead, cultural groups in competitive situations adopt only some features of competing groups, or more frequently, new hybrid cultural traits emerge through the fusion of features from mul- tiple groups. In any particular case, there are various potential reasonsfor why one trait, and not another, was adopted after a process of con- quest, imitation, or migration.WhileCGS may be a factor,wecan also appeal to other factors not accounted for by CGS, including the direct appeal of that trait or pure chance. To be convinced that CGS is a strong force in cultural evolution, we need evidence that cultural bor-rowing in cases of conquest,imitation, andmigration is predominantly driven by contribution to group-level differential success, and not by other potential explanations. We speculate that CGS is not among the strongest forces driving which cultural traits spread in such cases. To see why, let us examine a paradigmatic case. The authors (Richerson et al.) consider the spread of religion as a flagship case of CGS, noting that features of Christianity contributed to the success ofChristian groups, so those cultural features spread both through successful conquest and through comparative success in situations of resource scarcity. A closer inspection, however, calls this story into question. The spread of a religion does not entail the spread of all its cultural features. On the contrary, it has long been recog-nized that the spread of religion in the face of differential success of cultural groups involves syncretism ,d ened as \"a type of accep- tance characterized by the conscious adaptation of an alien form or idea in terms of some indigenous counterpart \"instead of the replacement of the indigenous trait by the foreign one (Madsen1967 , p. 369). Consider the spread of Roman Catholicism to what is now Mexico. Invading European cultural groups out-com- peted the pre-Columbian cultural groups of Mexico, and part ofthe conquest involved the adoption of Catholicism by native groups. The adoption, however, was syncretic -the surface trap- pings of Catholicism became part of local culture, but indigenous groups were selective about which Catholic practices they adopted, and also selectively retained native practices by givingthem a nominally Catholic guise. Well-known examples include the retention of indigenous holidays such as D\u00eda de Muertos, the continuance of traditional practices such as curanderismo , and the thinly-veiled re-presentation of indigenous deities as Catholic saints such as La Virgen de Guadalupe. How does syncretism of this sort tell against CGS? Syncretism demonstrates that the spread of a religion due to the dominance of a cultural group does not entail the successful reproduction of anyCommentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 38 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59particular aspect of the cultural systems associated with that group. Although, for instance, Mayan communities adopted thepractice of saint worship from the conquering Spanish, Mayan saint worship tends to \"evince a more profound parochialism than did saint worship in 16th-century Spain. Cosmologically, Maya saints have become decidedly local personages relatively in- dependent of the remote ...God\"(Watanabe 1990 , p. 137). This is telling. The conquest of New Spain was facilitated by the paro- chialism of indigenous cultural groups; the fractious independent city states of Mexico could not compete with a nation-state builtaround a common identity. Nevertheless, this cooperative feature of Spanish Catholic culture was resisted by many of the conquered peoples, even while cultural traits irrelevant to differ- ential success (e.g., the names of deities) were adopted. In short, the veneer of Catholicism spread, but for CGS, it is not the veneerthat matters, but rather the values and practices which contribut- ed to differential group success. Which values and practices were adopted, however, seems to have little to do with whether they contributed to success, but instead with how those practices indi- vidually appealed to the conquered peoples. Other cases of the spread of religion by conquest, imitation, and migration exhibit the same pattern, as do, we would argue, cases of cultural transmission in other domains. To a large degree then, which cultural traits spread in cases of differential competitive success is explained by factors other than the role those traitsplayed in that success. To determine the relative strength of CGS in relation to other cultural evolutionary forces, we need not only to establish that conditions favorable to CGS are met, but also to examine particular instances of cultural transmission. This would involve systematically sampling traits from the moresuccessful cultural system, then determining for each individual sample whether it spread and, if so, the extent to which CGS con- tributed. By establishing a theoretical background against whichwe can perform this sort of investigation into the contributions of CGS to the evolution of human cultural traits, Richerson et al. open the doors to research that may help us better under- stand many of the most notable features of culture. Cultural group selection in the light of the selection of extended behavioral patterns doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000230, e51 Carsta Simon Department of Behavioral Science, Oslo and Akershus University College, 0130 Oslo, Norway. carsta.simon@hioa.no https://www.hioa.no/tilsatt/csimon Abstract: The cultural group selection hypothesis is supported by considerations of short-term and long-term behavioral patterns of groupmembers, and the short-term and long-term consequences of that behavior. The key to understanding cooperation lies in understanding that the effect of an extended behavioral pattern does not equal -and might even be opposite to -the added effects of its parts. Richerson et al. argue that widespread cooperation between human non-relatives and Darwin 's observation that individuals \"sacrice themselves for the common good \"(Darwin 1874 , pp. 178-79; see epigram at start of target article) are best explained by a mechanism of cultural group selection (CGS). In the follow- ing, I elaborate on how ontogenetic mechanisms may also have contributed to our organization in groups and how both coopera- tion and the sub-phenomenon of \"self-sacri ce\"may be under- stood as parts of temporally extended behavioral patterns exhibited either by a group or by individuals. Behavior of groups, as well as of individuals, takes time. Since time is limited, possible activities compete. Natural selection chooses those activities that correlate either with PhylogeneticallyImportant Events (PIE) that ultimately enhance tness or ontoge- netic proxies of these PIEs (Baum 2012 ). Temporally extended activities have parts that consist of smaller-scale behavioral pat- terns. Thus, natural selection acts on behavioral patterns of varying complexity. Those patterns might be extended in time, as well as in social space; that is, they can be exhibited by an indi- vidual or by a group. More local behavioral patterns have otherconsequences than more extended patterns embracing those local patterns. To estimate an activity 's effect on an individual 's or a group 'stness, we need to weigh the long-term effects of the sum of local acts against the long-term effect of the behavioral pattern as a whole. The key to understanding cooperation or self- sacrice lies in the realization that the effect of the pattern as a whole does not equal the added effects of its parts, let alone does a particular part affect tness in the same direction as the whole pattern. Focusing on the consequences of parts (i.e., single local acts) can lead us up the garden path when explaining cooperation. The following two examples illustrate how the effect of an indi- vidual 's local act can differ from the effect of an individual 'so ra group 's extended behavioral pattern: An individual 's local act, such as an alcoholic 's acceptance of a drink at a party, is promptly followed by relaxed and friendly social interactions, that is, proxies oftness-enhancing PIEs. We call the acceptance of the drink \"impulsive. \"The alcoholic 's refusal of the drink is promptly fol- lowed by proxies for tness-decreasing PIEs such as social disap- proval or simply the absence of relaxed social interactions. If an alcoholic refuses a drink, we say that he or she is showing \"self- control. \"Despite the short-term consequences, an extended pattern of self-controlled behavior leads to enhanced tness. Even if every single refusal of a drink is punished by proxies for tness-decreasing PIEs, the extended pattern of abstinence from alcohol will correlate with being healthier, having morewell-functioning relationships, and a better economy -self-con- trolled behavior (as an extended pattern) enhances tness, as- sessed in the long run (Baum 2015 ; Rachlin 2004 ). A parallel mechanism selects the behavior of a group. Each par- ticular engagement in a cooperative activity, such as recycling,might be locally costly for the individual. If, however, enough group members cooperate, those activities lead to tness-enhanc- ing PIEs or their proxies. The effect of the more extended behav- ioral pattern is in the interest of the individual as well as of the group. Of course, those individuals who in fact recycled are notnecessarily those whose tness actually bene ts. In most instanc- es, however, the whole group bene ts, which means that those who contributed at their own immediate cost often do indeed bene t in the long run. An individual 's acts that lead -if they are not punished -to PIEs advantageous for his or her own tness but disadvantageous for the tness of other group members, are labeled \"selsh,\"whereas acts that are in the short run costly for the individual but bene cial for the group -in- cluding the individual \"cooperative. \"How many in- stances of \"self-sacri ce\"are advantageous for the individual 's tness can be understood when analyzing them as parts of rates of cooperative behavior, which correlate with rates of consequenc- es, such as reciprocity. Even if altruistic behavior is not central to their argument, Richerson et al. \"are inclined to think that evolution has built an element of [ ...] true altruism into our social psychology \"(sect. 6.2, para. 2). If \"true altruism \"is de ned by the absence of tness-enhancing consequences on the actor 's behavior, here, Richerson et al. 's account is not reconcilable with the view of al- truistic behavior as a temporally extended behavioral pattern that may be learned over an individual 's lifetime (Rachlin 2002 ). An individual act of cooperation, as well as of altruism, each of which might even be followed by tness-decreasing PIEs in the short run, can nevertheless be tness-bene cial when repeated over time. Just as biological selection has acted on groups of organs constituting organisms, extended behavioral patterns(i.e., groups of acts) can be selected together.Commentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 39http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59How do the abstract patterns of behavior resist being broken up by sel sh behavior? Richerson et al. posit that group-variable culturally transmitted social norms with group-level functionality are evidence of CGS. Teaching and following norms and rules are practices that func- tion to overcome sel sh and impulsive behavior. We have rules such as \"brush your teeth twice a day \"to ensure that our offspring act in a self-controlled manner and to maximize their tness in the long run, and we have rules such as \"help others \"to ensure the coherence of the group. In different environmental situations, natural selection occur- ring within groups and between groups may have different relative strengths. Even if cooperation, de ned as \"working together toward a shared aim \"(Wehmeier and Hornby 2000 ), was selected because it commonly enhanced the individual 's long-term tness, it neither follows that cooperation enhances all cooperators ' tness, nor that all acts that we classify as parts of cooperative behavior do so. A truly self-sacri cing act can come about because it is generally advantageous to cooperate, and making de- cisions on a case-by-case basis is costly. Just as a single drink in apattern of abstinence does not signi cantly change the correlation between that pattern and PIEs (e.g., good health), a single tness- reducing act of an individual will not signi cantly change the cor- relation of cooperative behavior and its tness-enhancing effect resulting from the group 's collaboration. Richerson et al. offer a coherent framework which is supported, complemented, and potentially slightly modi ed by the proposed considerations of behavioral patterns and their consequences in different time frames.

Self-interested agents create, maintain, and modify group-functional culture doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000242, e52 Manvir Singh, Luke Glowacki, and Richard W. Wrangham Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Peabody Museum, Cambridge, MA 02138. manvirsingh@fas.harvard.edu glowacki@fas.harvard.edu wrangham@fas.harvard.edu http://www.manvir.orghttp://scholar.harvard.edu/glowacki/home Abstract: We agree that institutions and rules are crucial for explaining human sociality, but we question the claim of there not being \"alternatives to CGS [that] can easily account for the institutionalized cooperation that characterizes human societies \"(target article, sect. 7). Hypothesizing that self-interested individuals coercively andcollaboratively create rules, we propose that agent-based hypotheses offer viable alternatives to cultural group selection (CGS). Richerson et al. argue that cultural systems, such as prosocial re- ligion and institutions that maintain social order, play a vital role in enabling the cooperation of both small- and large-scale human so- cieties. We agree. But we are unconvinced that cultural group se-lection (CGS) is the only hypothesis able to account for the existence of such phenomena. CGS leads to group-functional culture by selecting on cultural variation (Boyd & Richerson 2010 ), but such selection presupposes that group-functional equi- libria exist already, suggesting that other processes, includingwithin-group dynamics, contribute to the emergence of group- functional culture. Since researchers have long recognized that in- dividuals with the requisite power coercively and consensuallycreate rules, we propose a complementary \"rule-makinghypothesis \"for group-adaptive institutions. Understanding the contribution of such agent-based social processes is essential forevaluating the value and limits of CGS theory. Focusing speci cally on rules and institutions that control social deviance (one of Richerson et al. 's three examples of group-adap- tive culture; see sect. 6.2), we describe two manifestations of this rule-making hypothesis. The rst emerges when asymmetries in power or in fluence allow parties to create and impose rules that satisfy their own interests. Depending on whether the interests of these coercive authorities coincide with those of the group,these individuals will sometimes but not always create and main- tain rules with group-level bene ts. An alternative form of this hy- pothesis develops when power is more evenly distributed. In these cases, coordinated groups of individuals can consensually create, modify, and enforce rules that control defection. Individuals can have key roles in producing group-functional rules if they have suf cient power or in fluence to institute cultural changes and enforce new rules. Schapera ( 1970 ) observed that Tswana tribal chiefs drove cultural change by introducing innova- tions ranging from single rules, such as the banning of beer, to in-frastructural changes, like the establishment of a police system. The chiefs 'objectives in creating rules included quelling social dis- turbance, reducing poverty, and collectivizing otherwise divergent interests -goals with explicit group-level bene ts. Functional rules can also stem from leaders dealing with novel forms of con-flict. Llewellyn and Hoebel ( 1941 ), in their ethnography of the Cheyenne legal system, described how tensions arose after one man borrowed another individual 's horse without permission. The military chiefs eased the friction between the parties and then established a rule: \"Now we shall make a new rule. There shall be no more borrowing of horses without asking ...[If] the taker tries to keep them, we will give him a whipping \"(p. 128). Considering the role of coercive rule-makers offers an alternativeexplanation not only for the origin of group-functional culture, but also for its maintenance, because powerful rule-makers should continue to enforce group-functional rules as long as the rules satisfy their own perceived self-interest. Moreover, the coercive authority dynamic accounts for the ubiquity of institutions thatasymmetrically bene t the powerful, spanning etiquette norms (e.g., Trobriand Islanders: Malinowski 1926 ) and food taboos (e.g., the Etoro: Kelly 1980 ; the Aranda: Spencer & Gillen 1927 ; and the Sanum\u00e1: Taylor 1981 ). Coercive rule-makers who have the power to change rules should create group-functional culture when their own interests coincide with those of their groups. In some cases, these overlap- ping interests stem from coercive rule-makers preferring groups with cooperative, compliant individuals. Elders of the Kurnai of Australia demanded that young boys \"listen to, and obey the old men\"and \"live peaceably with their friends \"(Howitt 1885 , p. 316), rules that improve the welfare of the elders while also cre- ating group-level bene ts. Studies of punishment in animal socie- ties show that CGS is not necessary for the coercive enforcement of group-adaptive behavior (Singh and Boomsma 2015 ). Reeve (1992 ) found that naked mole rat queens harass lazy subordinates, while Flack et al. ( 2005 ;2006 ) noted that dominant macaques police con flicts among subordinates, stabilizing their own high status while reducing within-group con flict. To this point, we have illustrated the ability of powerful individ- uals to create group-adaptive rules. However, the development of group-functional culture does not require that novelty originate with coercive authorities. Parties of similarly powerful individualscan also establish and maintain rules to control each other 's behav- ior. Systems of rules that emerged across camps during the California Gold Rush represent a well-studied example of self-in- terested individuals coordinating to create and enforce novel insti- tutions of social order. Despite the absence of organized state law,miners residing at promising digs convened and instituted major- ity-approved rules to protect mining rights and safety (McDowell 2004 ). Violations of those rules spurred injured parties to seek redress through the support of the community, who used coordi-Commentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 40 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59nated punishment to enforce rules. Ostrom 's(1990 ) review of small-scale institutions that manage common pool resources sim-ilarly exempli es how the coordination of self-interested agents can produce group-functional culture. Fishermen in Alanya, Turkey, for example, took 10 years to perfect an institution to control overharvesting and con flict, with a built-in means of moti- vating individuals to monitor and enforce violations of mutuallyrecognized rules. Last, group consent can interact with authorities to produce group-functional culture. Among the Enga of New Guinea, leaders presented cultural innovations to their groups,though group consensus ultimately governed adoption. As Wiess- ner ( 2002 ) summarized, \"The innovations promoted were ones that leaders felt could be played to their own advantage; the inno- vations that stuck were those that worked for the individual and the group \"(p. 251). Here we brie fly reviewed evidence that individuals motivated by self-interest can create group-functional culture through coer- cion, consensus, or both. Although our discussion is largely re- stricted to rules controlling deviance, these arguments apply to the development of other domains of group-functional cultureas well, such as institutions that reward otherwise costly behaviors (Glowacki & Wrangham 2013 ) and prosocial religion (Norenzayan et al. 2016 ). Only after recognizing complementary and alterna- tive hypotheses for group-functional culture, as well as the criteria for testing among them, will we be able to assess Richerson et al. 's claim that CGS is uniquely important in generating the cultural systems underlying human cooperation. The selective social learner as an agent of cultural group selection doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000254, e53 Sarah Su\u00e1rez and Melissa Koenig Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55436. suare062@umn.edu mkoenig@umn.eduhttp://www.cehd.umn.edu/icd/people/faculty/cpsy/koenig.html Abstract: Developmental research characterizes even the youngest learners as critical and selective, capable of preserving or culling cultural information on the bases of informant accuracy, reasoning, or coherence. We suggest that Richerson et al. adjust their account ofsocial learning in cultural group selection (CGS) by taking intoconsideration the role of the selective learner in the cultural inheritance system. Richerson et al. 's discussion rightly characterizes social learning as one of the key facilitators of cultural group selection (CGS). While we agree with the idea that social learning is essential for cultural inheritance, and serves as a source of cultural variation and selec-tion, we believe that the authors 'discussion has underspeci ed the signi cant role of the rational, critical, and selective social learner in these evolutionary processes. We would rst like to note that behavioral imitation, which the authors focus on, is not the only form of social learning that couldreduce intergroup cultural variation. Cultural variation between groups is a starting point not only for the spread of group-bene - cial behaviors but also for group-bene cial beliefs, ideas, or concepts. Contact with out-group scienti c knowledge, for example, could result in the adoption of this cultural information by less successful groups. In such cases, learning would not be pri- marily imitative in nature -one could not describe cross-cultural learning about microbes, for example, as primarily imitative innature, and yet this has reduced between-group variation in cul- tural beliefs about the unseen causes of disease. That said, the selective social learner is in fluenced by factors beyond those cited by Richerson et al. (those being a penchant for conformity, the sway of prestige, af nity for cultural norms, orgroup membership biases). A growing body of developmental re- search characterizes even the youngest social learners as active par-ticipants in the learning process, whose selectivity can act to preserve or cull testimonial information on the basis of its accuracy, support, and coherence with other beliefs (Stephens et al. 2015 ). These belief-formation processes are supported by children 's rapid assessments of others 'competence, expertise and trustworthi- ness. Monitoring the content and coherence of messages protects learners against misinformation, alerting them to con flicts between incoming messages and their already established knowl-edge and beliefs (Mercier & Sperber 2011 ). For example, infants detect overt labeling errors and anomalous referential actions (Gliga & Csibra 2009 ). They expect humans with appropriate infor- mation to speak truthfully, and actively correct inaccurate labelers (Koenig & Echols 2003 ). In imitation research, children have been found to give priority to the approach taken by a successful individual over an unsuccessful group, showing that in learning actions, successful outcomes often trump conventional means (Sco- eld et al. 2013 ; Seston & Kelemen 2014 ; Wilks et al. 2015 ). Further research suggests that the detection of inaccuracy mightlead to enhanced memory for incompetent sources and poor memory for the information they present (Corriveau & Harris 2009 ; Koenig & Woodward 2010 ;S a b b a g h&S h a f m a n 2009 ). Even more relevant to CGS, research in this eld suggests that children make rational learning decisions on the basis of whetheror not the messages they receive from informants violate their ex- isting understanding of the world (Sobel & Kushnir 2013 ). Pre- schoolers, for example, have been known to preferentially learn from more expert (Koenig & Harris 2005 ; Koenig & Jaswal 2011 ), more grammatically pro cient (Corriveau et al. 2011 ; Sobel & Macris 2013 ), and logically consistent informants (Doebel et al. 2011 ). They also flexibly adjust their trust in infor- mants 'testimony based on their understanding of what is improb- able and impossible (Corriveau et al. 2014 ; Shtulman & Carey 2007 ; Woolley & Ghossainy 2013 ). Young learners 'reliance on their own understanding of what is correct, true, or possible should not be underestimated: Their preferences for native-ac- cented speakers (Corriveau et al. 2013 ), adults (Jaswal & Neely 2006 ), and familiar speakers (Corriveau & Harris 2009 ) are re- versed if they learn that such sources have proven inaccurate. This is not to say that children are always critical in the face of message con flicts: Preschoolers have been found to trust a decep- tive adult who provides inaccurate information about an object 's location (Jaswal 2010 ; Jaswal et al. 2010 ). Interestingly, this may be because preschoolers are more sensitive to violations of com- monly held cultural knowledge (Stephens & Koenig 2015 ; Koenig & Stephens 2014 ). As children develop, they incorporate their growing knowledge and experience about speakers and the world to evaluate new in- formation. Considerations about message coherence and plausi- bility are taken into account along with other factors -including, as Richerson et al. mention, informant prestige, cultural conven- tions, conformity, normativity, group membership, and so on. We suspect that children appraise social learning situations based on their recognition of both cultural and epistemic norms, with priority afforded to each based on the situation(Hodges 2014 ), type of testimony or information being exchanged (Stephens & Koenig 2015 ), and the values endorsed in their envi- ronment (Reifen Tagar et al. 2014 ). How exactly does this selective learner play a role in CGS? Richerson et al. describe three forms of social learning that helpmaintain or reduce group-level cultural variation: (1) accurate, rapid social learning; (2) conformist social learning, described as mechanisms that maintain intergroup variation of cultural norms and behaviors; and (3) selective imitation of cultural behaviors, de- scribed as a process by which intergroup variation is reduced.Along these lines, we would argue that the selective learner 's ability to critically evaluate cultural information on the basis of its accuracy, support, and coherence contributes to CGS in twomain ways. First, as previously described, the social learner canCommentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 41http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59reduce intergroup cultural variation by rationally evaluating out- group cultural information and adopting that which is deemedto be not only useful, but reliable. Second, the selective social learner is able to ensure accurate cultural transmission not only through imitative or conformist strategies, but also by evaluating various forms of cultural information on the bases of accuracy, logic, and internal coherence. Thus, when a 16-month-old cor-rects an informant who labels a shoe as a ball, upholding culturally speci c labels, what may appear to be an early tendency toward conformity may involve critical appraisals of messages, alongwith epistemic inferences about the informant. In sum, we suggest that Richerson and colleagues take into further consideration the role of the rational and selective social learner, who can critically evaluate cultural information and adjust their own learning accordingly. Human cooperation shows the distinctive signatures of adaptations to small-scale social life doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000266, e54 John Toobyaand Leda Cosmidesb aCenter for Evolutionary Psychology, and Department of Anthropology, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106;bCenter for Evolutionary Psychology, and Department of Psychology and Brain Sciences,University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106. tooby@anth.ucsb.educosmides@psych.ucsb.edu www.cep.ucsb.edu Abstract: The properties of individual carbon atoms allow them to chain into complex molecules of immense length. They are not limited tostructures involving only a few atoms. The design features of our evolved neural adaptations appear similarly extensible. Individuals with forager brains can link themselves together into unprecedentedly largecooperative structures without the need for large group-bene cial modi cations to evolved human design. Roles need only be intelligible to our social program logic, and judged better than alternatives. The title of the target article advances the bold claim that: \"Cul- tural group selection [CGS] plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation. \"By the end of the target article, the argu- ment has been watered down: \"evidence ...[justi es]taking the hypothesis seriously as [one] basic explanation \"(sect. 7, para. 2, emphasis added). That is, vaguely characterized non-quantitative facts about humans do not prove the impossibility of CGS in fluencing the distribution of cooperative behavior, however minutely. We agree it is possible. Richerson et al. similar-ly retreat from CGS being an essential explanation for human co- operation, substituting the claim that it is an explanation for \"our species 'highly unusual ability to create large societies with wide- spread cooperation \"(sect. 7, para. 2, emphasis added). Because \"large societies \"are a recent evolutionary novelty, it follows that selection in ancestral small-scale societies was what predominantly forged the (genetically) evolved mechanisms that make cooperation in modern large-scale societies possible. Indeed, the context in which something evolves (e.g., cooperative mechanisms in foragers living in small-scale societies) does notpredict its capacity to scale (e.g., cooperation in mass societies). Vision that evolved to see things closer than 3 miles can see for light-years; language capacities that evolved to allow our ancestors to speak to hundreds now allow us to speak to millions. CGS proponents nd the existence of cooperation in mass socie- ties a self-evident evolutionary puzzle because the numbers involved evoke the impression that selection is not at equilibrium (which it need not be). In contrast, we think researchers need to carefullycharacterize the computational architectures of our evolved arrayof neural adaptations for exchange, delayed implicit reciprocity, risk-pooling, alliances, coalitions, coordination (such as theory ofmind), bargaining, aggression, mateship, parenting, kin selection, partner choice, reputation, externality-management, social learning, and so on, together with their interactions. Only then can you know whether any puzzling residue of \"group-bene cial behavior \"in modern societies remains, requiring further explanation. The dazzlingly extended forms of modern cooperation we see today (Adam Smith 's division of labor supporting globe-spanning trade) appear differentially built out of adaptations for small-scalesociality that modularly scale, such as exchange -rather than the marginal benevolence of Smith 's butcher, brewer, and baker. Evi- dence indicates that political attitudes toward welfare and redistribu- tion re flect a specialized forager psychology of sharing for variance reduction (Petersen et al. 2012 ) and resource-con flict (Petersen et al. 2013 ). Societies that attempted to harness general benevolence to organize institutions and production -the USSR, East Germany, China, Cambodia, North Korea, Cuba -were spectacular coopera- tive failures. That they functioned at all depended on other scalable small-scale specializations -aggressive threats (conditional punish- ment), hierarchy, dominance, coalitions, and so forth. Even ancestral foragers had institutions (enduring coordination with different roles). We do not understand why individually se- lected psychological adaptations for cooperation, coordination, coalitions, theory of mind, metarepresentations (i.e., xis a rule), intelligent instrumental reasoning (that allows locally contingent tailoring of actions to goals), social learning, a social psychology that understands and deploys incentives, hierarchies (and so on) are considered inadequate to explain institutions, then or now. It is puzzling why the authors believe that modern institutionscannot be far better explained without recourse to CGS, by the combined operation of these neural adaptations in dense, persist- ing social networks of intelligent, cultural agents (Boyer &Petersen 2011 ). When the interlinked cognitive niche adaptations (Tooby & DeVore 1987 ; see also, Pinker 2010 ) such as intelli- gence, language, and culture are added, it is dif cult to see any obvious cooperative anomalies. Gene-culture coevolution proponents claim to see overwhelm- ing evidence of group-bene cial, individually costly behaviors in large societies that cannot be explained by (their computationally impoverished models of) reciprocity. For example, many results are interpreted as showing prosocial, other-regarding preferences purportedly inconsistent with individual selection, including ataste for fairness, excess generosity, and a failure to uniformly act with short-run sel shness. These preferences, together with a taste for altruistically punishing fairness norm-violators, are be- lieved to work together to make people sacri ce their individual interests for the bene t of the group -which then helps groups in intergroup competition. However, the supporting experimental ndings typically involve constrained choices that con flate hypoth- eses, rather than test them cleanly. When these defects areremoved from experimental designs, supporting results collapse. For example, when subjects have the added choice of taking from others as well as giving, they no longer give in dictator games (List 2007 ). Young children, purportedly averse to unfair divisions, will choose to pay a cost to reduce the welfare ofothers when given the chance (Sheskin et al. 2014 ). In previous experimental designs testing for third-party punishment of unfair dividers, the only choices available were to punish or not. When this demand-characteristic is removed by adding the option of rewarding unfairness, average \"altruistic \"punishment approaches zero (Pedersen et al. 2013 ). Where partners can defect on both the subject and third parties, subjects punish those who defect on them personally (Krasnow et al. 2012 ). More- over, they only punish those they subsequently choose to interact with, not those who could only harm others. This indicates thatpunishment is a tool of negotiation, and not primarily designed to altruistically uphold group norms. Finally, the models typically used to represent individually se- lected strategies of social interaction ( \"reciprocity \") are strikinglyCommentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 42 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59impoverished (e.g., Cooperate, Defect), are largely free of social ecology and computation, and rest on many implausible assump-tions. They need to be replaced with an adaptationist game theory. For example, to determine whether to cooperate, agents need to know whether an interaction is one-shot or repeated. When this aspect of real-world cooperation is added to simulations of reci- procity, then \"excess \"generosity reliably coevolves with reciproc- ity, eliminating observed generosity as an evolutionary puzzle (Delton et al. 2011 ). The rapid cultural dynamics of moral norms (think French Revolution) seem far better explained by ri-valrous agents opportunistically seeking allies to jockey for self-ad- vantageous norms (Tooby & Cosmides 2010 ), than by the slow accumulation of group-bene ting norms through some groups doing better than others. In 1789, institutions that developed over a thousand years were swept away in a thousand days.Thus, we may nd that the code and open parameters of evolved programs underlie the combinatorial rules and building blocks of institutional cooperation. Cultural group selection is plausible, but the predictions of its hypotheses should be tested with real-world data doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000278, e55 Peter Turchinaand Thomas E. Currieb aDepartment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269;bCentre for Ecology & Conservation, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus, http://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/index.php?web_id=Thomas_Currie Abstract: The evidence compiled in the target article demonstrates that the assumptions of cultural group selection (CGS) theory are often met,and it is therefore a useful framework for generating plausible hypotheses. However, more can be said about how we can test the predictions of CGS hypotheses against competing explanations usinghistorical, archaeological, and anthropological data. Scienti c theories such as cultural group selection (CGS) must be assessed in two ways. First, the basic underlying assumptions on which an idea rests should be shown to be coherent and realistic. Second, the theory should generate hypotheses with testable pre- dictions about phenomena in the real world that we should observe if the theory is correct. In the target article, Richerson et al. do an excellent job of demonstrating that, indeed, the as- sumptions of CGS theory are often met, and it is therefore auseful framework for generating plausible hypotheses. In particu- lar, the properties of cultural inheritance, processes such as con- formity and frequency dependence, and the ubiquity and importance of institutions enable the maintenance of variation between groups upon which selection can act even in the faceof physical migration between groups (a large hurdle facing genetic group selection models). The importance of this should not be underestimated, given the somewhat controversial and divisive history of this subject. However, we feel there is more that can be said about how we can test the predictions of CGS hypotheses as explanations of human cooperation, speci cally with respect to testing them against competing explanations. CGS is an overarching framework that can generate more speci c hypotheses that can be tested against alternatives. Let 's consider the following: over the last 10,000 years, the scale of human cooperation has increased by several orders of magnitude: from small-scale groups of some hundreds of foragers to large modern states with populations ofhundreds of millions. Social scientists have advanced a multitudeof theories explaining this \"major evolutionary transition \"(sensu Maynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995 ). Such theories tend to come in several flavors (Carballo et al. 2014 ).\"Functionalist \"(or\"volun- taristic \") explanations emphasize bene ts of cooperation all: buffering environmental risk, managing competition and ef cient allocation of resources, producing public goods such as an irriga- tion system, and capturing returns to scale in, for example, eco-nomic production (Johnson & Earle 2000 ). In contrast, \"conflict\"explanations focus on the dark side of large-scale social- ity: class struggle and exploitation, warfare and conquest (e.g.,Carneiro 1970 ). CGS theory can combine these functionalist and con flict elements, but in a highly speci c way: Cooperation within societies evolves as a result of con flict and competition between societies. It is possible (indeed likely) that the best explanatory model will combine more than one mechanism, with different factors, perhaps, interacting in nonlinear, synergistic ways. Evaluation of such complex quantitative explanations is not a problem for modern methods of analysis, especially when combined with a program of building mathematical models that explicitly incorpo-rate such interactions. In our own research we have made a number of steps in this direction. In a recent paper (Turchin et al. 2013 ) we examined whether increased competition between groups due to the development of horse-based forms of warfare (i.e., involving chariots, cavalry, etc.) was an importantforce in the historical emergence of very large-scale human soci- eties ( \"empires \"). Following the logic of CGS (or multi-level selec- tion more generally), we constructed an agent-based computer simulation in which \"cooperative \"cultural traits were only select- ed for due to the bene cial effects they had in competition between groups (without between-group competition, there was a heavy bias against developing such traits). We were able to test the predictions of this model against historical data aboutthe spatial distribution of empires over a 3,000-year period. En- couragingly, the predictions of the model showed a good match to the real data. Furthermore, turning off some of the important parameters in the models produced a large drop-off in the match between simulations and data. This indicates that our hypothesis isat least a plausible explanation for the evolution of socio-political complexity. This model is admittedly a gross simpli cation of the actual historical process, and these results are still somewhat pre- liminary; however, this work does demonstrate the ability to quan- titatively test the predictions of hypotheses informed by CGS,using the empirical record of past human societies. The next step is to test this hypothesis more explicitly against other alternative explanations, including those not motivated by CGS. An important point here is that different theories make very different predictions as to where, when, and under what cir-cumstances we should see the rise of large-scale societies in the archaeological and historical record, and such things as the order in which different aspects of societies emerge. So far theprogress in testing such theories has been slow. Yet the huge corpus of historical and archaeological information provides us with a remarkable empirical resource for testing theories and re- jecting empirically inadequate explanations. The key is transform- ing the wealth of information into a systematic form that facilitatesthe kinds of analyses we described above. Currently, we are col- laborating with colleagues from across multiple disciplines and around the world to develop a databank of coded and quantitative historical and archaeological information about past societies (Seshat: Global History Databank: http://seshatdatabank.info/ ), with which hypotheses about cultural evolution and human history can be tested, including those informed by CGS theory (Turchin et al. 2015). For example, in one project we are assessing the idea that competition between groups led to increased egali- tarianism in human groups, particularly beginning with develop-ments of several \"axial-age \"religions (Bellah 2011 ). Importantly, this idea will be rigorously tested against other competing explana- tions, for example, the idea that religion is the \"opiate of the masses, \"by which elites keep the majority of the populationCommentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 43http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59subservient. Rather than the common approach of the social sci- ences or humanities where the world is interpreted according toa particular theoretical perspective, we follow the approach in which it is ultimately the data that decide which hypothesis pro- vides the best explanation. In summary, we contend that CGS has been shown to be a very productive generator of testable hypotheses. This theoreticalframework is capable of producing novel, even unexpected pre- dictions that can be then contrasted with predictions made by al- ternative theories using historical and archaeological data.Whether hypotheses derived from CGS theory are \"true\"or not, this framework has already demonstrated its value as a pro- ductive research program in the sense of the philosopher of science Imre Lakatos ( 1978 ). Multi-level selection, social signaling, and the evolution of human suffering gestures: The example of pain behaviors doi:10.1017/S0140525X1500028X, e56 Jacob M. Vigil and Eric Kruger Department of Psychology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, 87131 -1161. vigilJ@unm.edu esk@unm.edu http://www.unm.edu/~psych/faculty/sm_vigil.html Abstract: Pain suffering has been naturally selected to be experienced and expressed within a wider social system. The communication of painimproves group coordination and decision-making about engaging in resource dependent and potentially risky endeavors. Recent ndings warrant the development of a cohesive framework for understanding thereciprocal nature of pain expression and individual and group-leveloutcomes that can generate novel predictions on the heuristical expression of human suffering in naturalistic and clinical settings. Richerson et al. present an interesting take on the contemporary movement to understand the complexity of human behavior via multi-level selection forces. Their arguments in favor of multi- level selection by way of cultural group tness, though speculative, highlight the potential application in evaluating the social struc- ture as a potent mediator in the selection of characteristics of human psychology. It may in fact be the case that a multitude of basic biological systems have been in fluenced by both individ- ual- and group-level selection forces due to the reciprocal natureon individual and group tness outcomes. One domain of mental and physical health functioning that likely evolved within the con- straints of embedded social communication is the experience anddemonstration of visceral suffering in its various forms (e.g., anxiety, sadness) including pain. In this commentary, we propose to extend Richerson et al. 's thesis by showing how human pain perception could have been in fluenced by multi- level selection, a thesis that, if true, has broad implications forthe future directions of evolutionary psychology and the clinical health sciences. There is no doubt that the behavioral expression of physical dis- comfort has both intra- and interpersonal functions that directly impact the individual 'stness. Some intrapersonal functions of pain perception include the ability to detect and discriminate en- vironmental threats, to serve as a warning system, to promote self- awareness (e.g., to attend to and protect an injured body-part), and to facilitate operant learning (e.g., to avoid dangerous stimuli; Eccleston & Crombez 1999 ). Relative to other species, these intrapersonal functions alone do not explain why humans express so many and such varied non-vital suffering behaviors, in- cluding those associated with chronic, psychosomatic, andemotion-induced pain conditions. One likely explanation for theadaptive bene ts of pain expression lies in the social-signaling properties of pain behaviors (Vigil & Strenth 2014 ). The social-signaling perspective maintains that pain behaviors are a pinnacle demonstration of vulnerability, which humans use and direct toward selective social partners to gain logistical and emotional social support in times of need (Vigil 2009 ). Expressive pain behaviors also allow sufferers to assess the altruistic reliabilityof the targets of their expression (e.g., friends, domestic partners or health care providers). In other words, persons who respond to a solicitation evoked by a pain expression are perceived as poten-tially more reliable social partners. To date, this social-signaling perspective of pain perception has been used (with relative success) for predicting individual differences that in fluence the ex- pression of pain in various social contexts, such as audience char- acteristics (Vigil & Alcock 2014 ; Vigil & Coulombe 2011 ; Vigil et al. 2014b ) and the simulated presence of another person (e.g., the sound of a stranger 's voice; see Vigil et al. 2014d ). Still, there is no reason to assume that the social-signaling func- tions of pain are limited to individual-level tness incentives alone. Thus, additional selection forces acting at the group level mayhave played a secondary or coevolutionary role in the selection of pain 's perception and expression. As Richerson et al. and others have noted (Geary 2010 ; Geary et al. 2003 ), humans evolved in an environment of coalitional competition whereby social cooperation was used to form alliances for protectingoneself from and competing against rival groups for control of ecologically relevant resources (e.g., food and mates). The coordi- nation of group activities was such a predominant feature through- out human evolution that it may make sense to conceptualize the group as a valid unit of selection. This is especially true if thesuccess of group activities depends on communication among members. Given that the expression of pain can be understood as an individual 's perception of threat and state of debilitation, the aggregate effect of multiple individuals expressing pain should ultimately in fluence a group 's behavior. Based on this, the selection of individual characteristics and attributes that bolster selective communication of pain within a group should enable improved group coordination and decision-making. Like-wise, groups that are better able to assess external threats (preda- tors, neighboring groups, or parasites) and in-group capabilities should have a greater chance of survival. From an evolutionary perspective, this hypothesis makes intuitive sense, given that humans are the quintessential social animal and competitionbetween groups is dependent on achieving effective group-level consensus on resource expenditure and risk-taking (e.g., engaging in new hunting tactics, migration, coalitional warfare). Complementary to this hypothesis is the role that empathy plays during interpersonal communication. Expressed empathycould be understood as a key behavioral mediator subserving the interpretation of individual-level vulnerability and threat (i.e., pain) in coalition members. Said differently, for pain 's ex- pression to nd an effective target, the receiver must be able to internalize the current state (and changes in that state) of physical and mental prowess of the signaler. This combination of pain and empathetic signaling (e.g., behavioral mimicry) distributed among group members enables group coordination. This hypothesis issupported by recent ndings suggesting that people express empathy systematically with the formation of social identities cre- ating an intragroup empathy bias -the increasing empathy between in-group members greater than that of out-group members (Cikara et al. 2011 ;2014 ). The mutual expression of pain and empathy enables in-group members to use this informa- tion in making effective decisions. In line with this, our lab has found that momentary pain reporting is in fluenced by the quantity and quality of the individual 's peer relationships (Vigil et al. 2013 ), relationships with pair-bonding partners (Vigil et al. 2014c ), and other types of co-residents (Vigil et al. 2014a ). These ndings suggest that pain has been naturally selected to be expressed sys- tematically within a broader social networking system. Further,recent work has explicated a neurobiological relationshipCommentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 44 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59between social and physical pain. Panksepp ( 1998 ) originally pro- posed the idea of social pain, and since then, numerous studieshave demonstrated a cognitive and behavioral overlap between the shared aspects of physical and social pain (Eisenberger & Cole 2012 ; Macdonald & Leary 2005 ). On the balance, the diverse research ndings from numerous lines of inquiry suggests a need for further empirical and exper-imental studies that would add to a developing framework for understanding how individual behavior is reciprocally shaped by both individual and group outcomes. Pain behaviors enjoya rich variability that may not be attributed to individual factors alone, and this new framework may offer alternative means for generating predictions of the evolved nature of human suffering. Clarifying the time frame and units of selection in the cultural group selection hypothesis doi:10.1017/S0140525X15000291, e57 Andrew Whitenaand David Erdalb aCentre for Social Learning and Cognitive Evolution, School of Psychology & Neuroscience, University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews KY16 9JP, United Kingdom;bSchool of Management, University of St. Andrews, KY16 9RJ, United Kingdom. aw2@st-andrews.ac.uk david@erdal.org.uk www.st-andrews.ac.uk/pro le/aw2 and discuss two issues for clari cation. First, over what timescale is cultural group selection proposed to have been active?Unprecedented cooperation is inferred to have arisen in hunter-gatherlife well before the recent period on which Richerson et al. focus. Second, what is the unit of selection? Groups (of human individuals)? Or cultural entities along the lines of \"meme-complexes \"? We congratulate authors Richerson et al. on the scope and scale of the wide-ranging literature they have brought to bear on theirthesis. This offers an impressive scholarly review of evidence bearing on the nature of human cultural evolution. Nevertheless, wend it dif cult to judge yet how compelling is the resulting case for cultural group selection (CGS) speci cally, because of a lack of clarity on some core issues. Here we focus on two. Therst concerns the period of human evolution that Richerson et al. aspire to address, which remains surprisingly ambiguous in the target article. Much of the article focuses on recent times, notably the Holocene. At one point they speculate that CGS may have been important \"as far back \"as symbolic evolution develop- ments, at around 160 k.y.a. But given that the authors start their article by taking the distinctiveness of human cooperation as the re- markable phenomenon they wish to explain, it seems to us that they should be more seriously addressing the earlier periods of hunting and gathering, including necessarily highly cooperative big-gamehunting, which a variety of evidence suggests was already signi - cant between 500 k.y.a. and 1 m.y.a. at least (Whiten & Erdal 2012 ). This is important not only because of its relevance to the authors 'central concerns, but also because the socio-cognitive pro- cesses selected for over this vast timescale are likely to have left a signicant legacy in the architecture of the human mind, including its cooperative and cultural dispositions. The ethnographic, archaeological, and comparative evidence that over the years we (Erdal & Whiten 1996 ; Whiten & Erdal 2012 ) and others have marshalled indicate that this long hunter-gatherer era was already marked by unprecedented egal- itarianism, generalized sharing, and coupled, enhanced levels of cooperation -the core phenomenon the authors profess to wishto explain -of various kinds. These have included cooperation in each of the enterprises of hunting (including manufacturing theweapons and traps utilized) and gathering, but also the ways in which these activities, typically undertaken through division of labour between separately foraging parties, are integrated over space and time and coordinated to permit generalized sharing of spoils at campsites, coupled with information exchangebetween hunters and gatherers that enhances subsequent forag- ing effectiveness. Among the many other forms of enhanced cooperation are shared child care and inter-band marriage ar-rangements. The result is that interdependence in hunter-gath- erers displays unique levels and forms among primates, such that through the exploitation of its socio-cognitive niche, the band effectively acts like a uni ed predatory organism, able to outcompete such \"professional predators \"as the large social car- nivores of Africa. It is thus the earlier evolution of these distinc- tive cooperative and other characteristics, in small bands numbering about 30 individuals, that begs explanation. Given these were surely already enmeshed in complex cumulative cul- tures, shouldn 't the analysis of Richerson et al. be focused more on the social dynamics and selective regimes that have operated in tens of thousands of generations of hunting and gathering? The unique forms and degree of interdependence among the members of a human hunter-gatherer band -which mean that the inclusive tness of individuals is highly contingent on their contributions to the effectiveness of the group as a whole -could perhaps be argued to provide an unusually suppor- tive context for the operation of genetic group selection. However, we are here talking instead of cultural group selection, and this leads us to the second issue we wish to raise, which is the moregeneral one of what exactly are the replicating (even if with varying delity) entities that are proposed to be exposed to differ- ential selection in the CGS theory? We feel this remains surpris-ingly unclear in this article. At times the authors write as if it is cultural \"groups \"of people, with some groups outcompeting or absorbing others. But should not the unit of replication instead be a cultural entity, more along the lines of (although not neces- sarily isomorphic with) -what have earlier been called \"memes \" or\"meme-complexes \"(e.g., Aunger 2000 )? The latter concept of a set of co-adapted cultural elements (Dawkins 1976 , pp. 212-213) is the of CGS would get purchase? And for CGS to occur, these meme-complex- es would somehow need to spread preferentially across popula-tions, as when cultural complexes such as religions like Catholicism, or even national cultures in the case of large scale in- vasions like that of the Roman Empire, spread through new pop- ulations. Selection involving the differential reproductive success of cultural entities (group-level selection where \"group \"is akin to \"meme-complex \") is a very different phenomenon to selection in- volving differential reproductive success of groups of individuals. The two are not mutually exclusive but it needs to be clearerwhether CGS is conceptualized as involving both types of compe- tition or one in particular? If the focus of the \"group \"term in CGS is cultural complex- es, perhaps such phenomena have indeed characterized only the relatively recent phases of human cultural evolution that theauthors focus on, particularly the Holocene. But is such a con- clusion based only on the fact that we have rich, relevant evi- dence about cultural change across this recent period? We know all too little about the processes that characterized the earlier and vastly longer period of our hunter-gatherer historywe alluded to earlier. Indeed, we know all too little about the nature of cultural change from all the studies undertaken in the recent ethnographic past. From what we do know (e.g., Hewlett et al. 2011 ; Jordan 2015 ), it is far from apparent that \"group \"needs inserting in \"cultural selection \"to characterize the processes at work.Commentary/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 45http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59Authors 'Response Cultural group selection follows Darwin 's classic syllogism for the operation of selection Zeffermanj aDepartment of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California - Davis, Davis, CA 95616;bGraduate Group in Ecology, University of California - Davis, Davis, CA 95616;cDepartment of Anthropology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112;dDepartment of Anthropology, Boise State University, Boise, ID 83725;eSchool of Human Evolution and Social Change, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287;fDepartment of Psychology, Dominican University of California, San Rafael, CA 94901;gDepartment of Anthropology, University of California -Davis, Davis, CA 95616;hSanta Fe Institute, Santa Fe, NM 86501;iSchool of Economics, University of Maine, Orono, ME 04469; jNational Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis, objective of our target article was to sketch the empirical case for the importance of selection at the level of groups on cultural variation. Such variation is massive in humans, but modest or absent in other species. Group selection processes acting on this variation is a framework for developingexplanations of the unusual level of cooperation between non-relatives found in our species. Our case for cultural group selection (CGS) followed Darwin 's classic syllogism regarding natural selection: If variation exists at the level of groups, if this variation is heritable, and if it plays a role in the success orfailure of competing groups, then selection will operate at the level of groups. We outlined the relevant domains where such evidence can be sought and characterized the main conclusions of work in those domains. Most commentators agree that CGS plays some role in human evolution, although some wereconsiderably more skeptical. Some contributed additional empirical cases. Some raised issues of the scope of CGS explanations versus competing ones. R1. Introduction We thank our commentators for their interesting and thoughtful re flections on our target article. Sincecommentaries often made more than one point regarding cultural group selection (CGS), in this Response wediscuss some of them in more than one section. Our discus-sion is organized in the following sections, re flecting 13 themes: Section R2. CGS is a framework. Section R3. Measuring cultural variation.Section R4. Little unites the three forms of CGS.Section R5. Institutions are important.Section R6. The relationship between psychological processes and cultural evolution. Section R7. Individual-level processes are important. Section R8. On what units does CGS operate?Section R9. Variations in the strength Section CGS.Section R12. Relationship of CGS to the expanded evolutionary synthesis. Section R13. Selection of extended behavior patterns. Section R14. The evidence is incomplete. R2. CGS is a framework Commentators Gintis andMace & Silva observe that CGS is a framework rather than an explanation. Barclay &K r u p p seem to be expressing the same idea when they describe CGS as a plausible force while arguing that itsaction needs to be demonstrated in actual cases. We agree. We see evolutionary theory as a framework, an accounting system, for keeping track of heritable varia-tion through time. A CGS framework is based on the em-pirical data strongly suggesting that heritable culturalvariation often exists between groups at scales larger thangroups linked by kinship or a history of reciprocation(target article, sect. 4). Thus, such groups will oftenrespond to some form of selection and many case studiessuggest that they do (sects. 5 and 6). The CGS frameworkhas been used to develop explanations for concrete phe-nomena, for example, the expansion of the Nuer at theexpense of the Dinka in the Southern Sudan in the 19thcentury. Kelly ( 1985 ) developed a CGS explanation for the Nuer expansion based on the classic ethnography ofEvans-Pritchard ( 1940 ). Kelly argued that the bride-price system of the Nuer caused them to count descent moredeeply than the Dinka, which made it possible for themto mobilize larger groups of ghters than the Dinka. Hence the Nuer more frequently won ghts than the Dinka and incorporated defeated Dinka into their tribes.It is only space constraint and the patience of readersthat prevented us from offering many more, and more de-tailed, examples. The empirical argument in our article isthat keeping accounts of group-level cultural variation,and on the impact of cultures selecting genes, is frequentlynecessary to explain events in human evolution. Turchin & Currie also use the concept of a framework to describe CGS. They and colleagues are building a histor-ical database in which they expect that the CGS frameworkwill frequently need to be employed to explain features ofhuman history. Other historically minded scholars haveadopted the cultural evolutionary framework exactlybecause it offers a disciplined method for investigatingResponse/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 46 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59and comparing quite concrete cases (e.g., Steinmo 2010 ). It is in the details of such cases that researchers can establish(or not) that an observed cultural difference betweengroups is actually affecting the outcome of their competi-tion in a manner consistent with an explanation rooted inCGS, as Barclay & Krupp correctly insist must be done. R3. Measuring cultural variation Three commentaries include remarks on the dif culty of accurately measuring cultural variation: Mace & Silva , Fuentes & Kissel , and Ross & Atkinson . All three cri- tique our use of the F STstatistic in particular (also see related discussions in sect. R8.) This is an importantpoint. The most ambitious attempt to catalog the world 's living cultures was the descriptive work of classical ethnog-raphers. This led to the development of an important data-base, the Human Relations Area Files ( http://hraf.yale.edu/ ), that has supported a great deal of quantitative comparativework. The descriptive work on cultural evolution andgene-culture coevolution has been conducted by historians,archaeologists, and geneticists. This is likewise beingcompiled into databases (target article, sect. 3.2). Unfortunately, information on variation within societies is very scanty compared to estimates of between-societyvariation. The individual-level data that we used insection 4.1 to estimate F STbetween various cultural units provide a large number of responses collected from largesamples, but we cannot be certain about the extent towhich the traits represent culturally heritable variation asopposed to variation in fluenced by direct environmental effects or genetic variation. We did choose questions (seethe appendix at the end of the target article) that seemintuitively to be cultural and related to norms and institu-tions. It is also undoubtedly the case that competitionbetween the political units known as \"countries \"is seldom the key level at which selection takes place. Cultural evolu-tionists have a big task before them to get better estimatesof the heritable components of within- and between-groupvariations. Despite these limitations, we maintain that our cultural F STestimates provide readily available evidence that between-group variation is suf cient for selection to act at the group level (Rogers 1990 ). Two speci c critiques of cultural FSTrequire further discussion, however: First, the applicability of the traits measured to CGS, andsecond, whether variation along geographic clines, notnominal groups, affect the scope of CGS. Mace & Silva andFuentes & Kissel worry about whether our cultural F STmeasurements assess variation relevant to cooperation. We note that, (1) many of the culturaltraits from which we derived cultural F STestimates do re flect cooperative altruism, as is made clear in the appendix. Forexample, we include questions about willingness to sacri ce personal resources for a public good, speci cally in the domain of climate change, government involvement in health care, and taxation by the state. Further, (2) we note that there is no reason why we would need to limit culturalF STcalculations to beliefs or behaviors related to altruism or cooperation. Every cultural or genetic trait can have itsown evolutionary trajectory, and this trajectory can be de-composed using the Price equation (Price 1970 ) into change due to individual-level and group-level effects.Moreover, altruistic traits are arguably the least interesting traits with which one could study the relative effects of in-dividual-level and group-level selection quantitatively. Bydenition, the regression of individual-level tness on indi- vidual-level allele frequency is negative for any altruistictrait (a result from Price 1972 ). The adaptive evolution of an altruistic trait therefore must be due to group-level selection (although not necessarily CGS). Investigation ofintergroup partitioning of variance in beliefs related toabortion is interesting in that such beliefs relate verydirectly to tness outcomes and could, in principle, be studied quantitatively. Further, broader cultural differences between groups, or measurements across a range of cultural traits, may approx-imate the relevant suite of differences resulting in a culturalexpansion due to group selection. In this view, our mea-surements of F STare trying to estimate the theoretically im- portant heritable variation that selection might be actingon. Some of that variation is, of course, generated by acomplex variety of processes. For example, the military ex-pansion of the Nuer at the expense of the Dinka (Kelly1985 ) is presumably not just due to differences in political organization. Differences in other cultural traits, such assubsistence strategy and bride wealth, are likely also impor-tant. Likewise, modern political groups differ on a largerange of possibly integrated issues that may cause onegroup to increase and the other to dwindle. The multidi-mensional quality of cultural expansions often requires usto try to identify and quantify the heritable variation that se-lection may be acting on. Similar levels of complexity areseen with genetic variation. Genetic F STmeasurements must also concede to complexity. Genetic quantitativecharacters are in fluenced by multiple contextual and con- tingent environmental variables within the processes of,for example, gene regulation, phenotypic plasticity, devel-opment, and epigenetics more generally. See our discus-sion of the problems biologists have linking genes tophenotypes in section R14, which is quite parallel to thedifculties in linking questionnaire responses to behavior. Ross & Atkinson raise the issues of nominal groups and spatial variation. Our measure of cultural F STis a direct ex- pression of the partitioning of variation in questionnaire re-sponses across the classi cation of individuals into discrete categories or groups. We have computed cultural F ST values between ethnolinguistic, political, and religious groups (appendix), adding to other work computing cultur-alF STbetween a larger sample of nations and four small- scale East-African societies (Bell et al. 2009 , Tables S1 and S2). These categories are in some sense ad hoc ,i n that we could classify these same individuals into anynumber of other categories/groups and produce a differentF STvalue. However, the data we used were obtained from opinion surveys which sampled units that the survey formu-lators considered to be meaningful social units. We makeno ontological assumption that empirical group boundariesare discrete, or that any one particular group classi cation is true. We simply illustrate that, if we assume a given classi-cation of individuals into groups, we can calculate the scope for group selection to act on the focal cultural traitas a function of this classi cation. It is true that many human groups have formal criteria for membership andare often symbolically marked by language, dialect, andother differences. Such groups often compete (targetarticle, sect. 5). In section 2.1 we discussed how symbolicResponse/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 47http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59marking can create boundaries to the flow of culture between groups. These boundaries are never completelyimpermeable. The project of understanding just how cul-tural diffusion is regulated from an evolutionary point ofview is in its infancy (Jordan 2015 ), although a considerable literature exists on how symbolic and formal boundaries affect the diffusion of innovations. Ross & Atkinson 'snding that geographic variation ex- plains more variation in folktales than currently observed\"group boundaries, \"shows that de ning the group struc- ture of a human population is complicated, but wecannot conclude from this that it is a worthless endeavor.Clinal geographic structure is a kind of group structure,as is nominal group identi cation. A cultural F STfor a given trait could be calculated using nominal group mem-bership (religion, political party, etc.), or using classi cation based on geographic structure to any arbitrary level of geo-graphic resolution (nation, state, county, city, postal code,area code, city block, etc.), or even on classi cation based on the interaction of geographic structure and nominalgroup membership. The scope of group selection tooperate on the given cultural trait could be analyzed inlight of each of these classi cations. Of course, to under- stand the system under consideration requires more thanestimating the scope for selection. We have to move fromthe scope for selection to the concrete norms, institutions,and payoffs to variant behaviors to understand what isevolving and why. Folktales may encode norms and be rel-evant to some CGS process acting on the groups in whichthey become common, or they could merely spreadbecause individuals nd some of them suf ciently enter- taining. See also Barclay & Krupp 's comments on the need to understand how a cultural trait affects thesuccess of individuals and/or groups in particular cases. R4. Little unites the three forms of CGS The study of cultural evolution has long been bedeviled by the complexity of the selective processes operating on cul-tural variation. Natural selection is important; the culturaltraits of individuals who survive and reproduce are morelikely to be passed on than those of individuals who donot thrive. But the capacity of individuals to decide (con-sciously or unconsciously) what cultural variants to learnand what to pass on is also important. Individuals also in flu- ence the innovation of new cultural variants. Moreover, col-lective decision-making occurs in many societies usinginstitutions like tribal councils and parliaments. All ofthese processes act as \"forces \"influencing the direction of cultural evolution. Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman ( 1981 ) called these latter types of forces \"cultural selection, \"and Boyd and Richerson ( 1985 ) talked about \"decision- making forces \"arising from individuals choosing how to behave given the choices offered by their culture and theopportunity to innovate. Morin is quite right that one form of CGS we describe, the differential growth, prolifer- ation, and extinction of cultural groups, is a form of natural selection. The other two, differential imitation and differ-ential migration, are selective decision-making processes,not natural selection. The main thing all three have incommon is that they are driven by variation amonggroups. We are not wedded to any particular terminologyin this matter. If people feel more comfortable seeingthese as three distinctive processes rather than ones with enough family resemblance to merit the CGS term, wehave no objection. At any rate, we hope that the similaritiesand differences are spelled out well enough in section 2. Morin 's more substantive claims are debatable. He argues that natural section on cultural variation is more likely to favor altruism (traits costly at the individual level) than selective imitation and selective migrationbecause the latter are based on individual decisions.There are two problems with this argument. First, imitationand migration decisions are typically made in the face ofconsiderable causal opacity. The decision maker, even if ra-tional and self-interested, cannot understand all of thecausal connections between an institution and the bene ts it confers. The imitator and especially the migrant maketheir decisions on the basis of results, not causal pathways.If a measure of altruism is essential to make an institutionwork, at least some imitators or migrants may acquire thehabit of altruism by imitation or teaching. It is good torecall that if a group selection process is favoring altruism,it will be because, averaged over all the altruists in themeta-population, altruistic types do better than non-altru-ists. In currently highly successful populations, altruistsmay be relatively numerous, even if not as successful assome of the rarer non-altruists in the successful population.Unless immigrants or imitators can compute the advantag-es of altruism versus defection rather accurately, they arelikely to often imitate the more numerous altruists.Second, recall the tribal social instincts hypothesis (sect.2.2). Humans are plausibly well-adapted genetically toliving in societies in which a measure of altruism is neces-sary to produce the bene ts of cooperation. In public goods game experiments, cooperation gets established if asufcient number of \"leaders \"pay costs to discourage selsh behavior, using whatever tools the experimenters give them, such as punishment or communication (e.g.,Baum et al. 2012 ). A minority of people are rationally selsh and a plurality are conditional cooperators, yet in the laboratory with enough tools to work with, altruists can establish near perfect cooperation. This result is common in Western samples, but worldwide behavior ismore variable (Herrmann et al. 2008 ). This nding is con- sistent with theoretical analyses which show that selectionfor altruism tends to be frequency dependent (Boyd &Richerson 1992b ). For example, if the costs to altruistic punishers for punishing a given defector are low relativeto the cost imposed on the defectors, the frequency of al-truistic punishers at equilibrium can be small in proportion.At least in the lab and in theory, a suf cient minority of al- truists is necessary to generate cooperation in sizeablegroups of non-relatives. There may well be a geneticbasis for this altruism driven by culture-led gene-culturalcoevolution (sect. 2.2). Morin 's remark that acquisition of behaviors by diffusion will not necessarily lead to demographic consequences is technically true but misleading. Borrowers can acquire aneutral cultural variant that is statistically but not causallyrelated to the success of the donor society. Normally, bor-rowers expect, or at least hope, that the cultural trait theyhave copied will have a similar positive effect on the func-tioning of their society. Once a variant is transferred, it willoften have similar effects in the host society as it did in thedonor society. However, we should not underestimate theproblems of mismatches with other institutions, withResponse/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 48 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59other aspects of culture, and with the environment. The de- cidedly mixed results of efforts to transfer modern Westerninstitutions to the former European colonies after WWIItestify to the problem (Gibson et al. 2005 ). We do not see the relevance of any alliance between the donor andborrowing society. Competing organizations often borrow institutional and military innovations from rivals (see sect. 5.2). R5. Institutions are important Several commentaries underscore the importance of insti- tutions. Institutions only operate when a substantialnumber of people obey their dictates; hence they are inher-ently group-level traits (sect. 4.3). At the same time, theschedule of rewards offered for conformity to the institu-tion damps down individual-level variation in behavior inthe groups that are operating the institution. The punish-ment of non-conformists prevents them from bene tting from the rewards the institution offers. Institutions varyfrom group to group. CGS may well act on other sorts ofcultural variation, but if institutions exist they are primecandidates to evolve by such processes. Read argues that CGS does not take into account that cultural idea systems are constituted at an organizationalrather than an individual level. Perhaps we were not suf - ciently clear, but, in the main, what institutions do iscreate organizations. Kinship systems as idea systems areused by many peoples to create kin-based organizations such as clans. It is the concrete organizations that actually compete for resources. Ideas may compete directly to berepresented in human brains, as in the cross-cultural bor-rowing we discuss. Presumably, the attractiveness of the in-stitutions of other societies is mostly related to potentialadopters 'estimates of how much an institution would improve the functioning of their own society. The Netsilikseal-hunting partnership cultural idea system is an institu-tion in our terms, and the Netsilik use it over and overagain to create concrete partnerships. Mace & Silva un- derscore the important point that kinship norms, politicalsystems, and religion are generally group-level traits. Houdek & Novakova introduce the interesting idea of frozen plasticity. Their idea is that as societies becomemore institutionally complex, interactions between themmake it increasingly dif cult to change dysfunctional insti- tutions. Eventually, large-scale events like the loss of warsor major natural disasters lead to a punctuated restructur-ing of social institutions during which time innovationsare made, often prosocial ones. Turchin ( 2006 ) makes a similar point. We did not intend to imply that the CGSframework is committed to steady and irreversible progresstoward better institutions, and if we seem to have done so,we apologize. The stylized facts suggest a trend in the Ho-locene toward ever more complex societies supporting anever larger human population, but a more detailed viewreveals this global trend to be frequently interrupted bylocal crises, retrenchment, collapse, and the social extinc-tion of whole societies. A mature theory will have toexplain both the trend line and the substantial deviationsaround it. We might imagine that in crises involving socie-ties with more or less equally complex institutions, the so-cieties with the least frozen and least dysfunctional institutions innovate their way out of the crisis, whiletheir marginally more dysfunctional competitors perish. In this way, on the multi-millennial time scale, the capacityof societies to manage institutional complexity has graduallyimproved, whereas on the millennial time scale much morecomplex historical processes dominate the dynamics (e.g.,Davies 2011 ). R6. The relationship between psychological processes and cultural evolution Several commentaries discuss the relationship between psychological processes and CGS, either as alternatives orcomplements. In our review of the CGS framework (sect.2), we noted the many ways in which the population-levelprocesses of CGS depend upon individual-level psycholog-ical processes. In our empirical discussion, we focused onthe early-developing cognitive structures that support thehuman social learning system (sect. 3.1) and the role ofnorm acquisition in making institutions possible (sect. 4.2). Henrich & Boyd 's commentary is very close to our view on the relationship between psychological and CGS pro-cesses. The important point is that that norms operate atthe individual level by reinforcing, co-opting, and example, Nisbett levels of the hormones cortisol and testosterone in Southern and Northern undergraduates(from the U.S.) when exposed to an insult. Southern partic-ipants disproportionately subscribed to a culture of honornorm, which on other behavioral measures indicated that Southerners react much more aggressively to mild insults than Northerners. The hormone measures show how emo-tional centers in the brain stem can be recruited by a cultur-ally transmitted norm (Panksepp & Biven 2012 ). Nisbett and Cohen review the historical data related to the evolution ofthe Southern Culture of Honor and the child-rearingpractices that cause it to develop. When considering gene-based predispositions, it must be remembered that by the end of infancy humans have de-veloped a sophisticated capacity for social learning (sect.3.1). The genetic and cultural contributions to adult cogni-tive structures will therefore co-develop from early child-hood as well as coevolve in evolutionary time. We as yetdo not know in much mechanistic detail how cognition de-velops or how it evolved. Features like incest avoidance, kinrecognition, and basic emotions are probably widely sharedwith other species, making animal models relevant to thediscussion. Historic information extracted from thegenome, together with improvements in the conventionalpaleoanthropological record, may one day tell us muchmore about how human brains and cognition evolved(Richerson et al. 2010 ). Cross-cultural developmental studies, which Henrich & Boyd and their co-workers are pioneering, will help tease apart genetic and cultural contri-butions to development. We think we know enough to becondent that the outline of the relationship between genes and culture in development that Henrich & Boydoutline is correct but our current understanding resolvesfew details. We are sympathetic to Tooby & Cosmides 'argument that much is built on gene-based social psychological inno-vations that evolved during the Pleistocene. We brie fly re- viewed the \"tribal social instincts \"hypothesis in section 2.2 and discuss it in relation to the suf ciency of individual-Response/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 49http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59level processes in sections R7 here and 2.2 in the target article. Tooby & Cosmides argue that individuals withneural adaptations evolved forager societiescan self-organize into large cooperative structures withoutthe aid of cultural evolutionary processes. They suggestthat ancestral foraging societies were small enough that in- dividual-level social skills are suf cient to explain their social structure, and that these skills likewise suf ce to explain the much larger scale and more complex societiesof today. Tooby & Cosmides question the realism of experimen- tal games that nd altruistic or other prosocial behavior. All experiments involve simpli cations. It is not clear that the experimental game studies they cite in support of their ar-gument are any more realistic. See Zefferman 's(2014a ) cri- tique of a simulation study by Delton et al. ( 2011 ) in this regard (see also Delton & Krasnow 2014 ; Zefferman 2014b ). The most ambitious attempts to relate experimen- tal games to the real world are the cross-cultural studies ofHenrich et al. ( 2004 ;2010a ) (see sects. 6.2, 6.3, and 4.3 in the target article). These studies were conducted mostly ininstitutionally simple hunting and gathering, herding, andhorticultural societies by ethnographers of the peoplestudied. This design was adopted so as to be able to inferfrom the extensive ethnographic knowledge whether ornot game behavior matched behavior in the society con-cerned. They summarize their main ndings as follows: We draw two lessons from the experimental results: rst, there is no society in which experimental behavior is even roughly consistent with the canonical model of purely self-interestedactors; second, there is much more variation between groups than has previously been reported, and this variation correlates with differences in patterns of interaction found in everyday life. (Henrich et al. 2004 , p. 5, emphasis ours) In section 6.2 we also brie fly discussed the social psychol- ogist Daniel Batson 's(2011 ) experimental program de- signed to test whether psychological altruism wasnecessary to explain participants 'behavior in circumstances where they could volunteer to aid someone in need.Batson 's experiments used deception to create scenarios that were as realistic as possible, and he found evidencethat some participants behaved altruistically. Tooby & Cosmides 'discussions of ( 2007 ) and Sheskin et al. (2014 ) are incomplete. In List 's taking treatments, dictator giving was substantially reduced relative to the standarddictator game, but the amount of taking was quitemodest. In a treatment where dictators and their partnershad to work to earn their money, very few dictators choseto take at all. List emphasizes that prosocial moralityplays a big role in his results. In Sheskin et al. 's study, young children, but not older ones, chose to pay a cost toreduce the welfare of others relative to their own.Whether this change with age was a product of an innatedevelopmental process or socialization, or both, is unan-swered by this study. We agree that ancestral forager societies were small compared to the giant societies in which many humans lived during the last 5,000 years, but we question the sug- gestion that they were so small that individual-level socialskills can explain their social structure. Human forager so-cieties are already large compared to chimpanzee andbonobo communities. Forager societies have culturally var-iable norms and institutions regulating family life and inter-family cooperation. As Hill et al. ( 2014 ) show, the bandscale units of forager tribes are fluid, and cooperation with many distantly related or unrelated people iscommon. In ethnographic cases, and by at least theUpper Paleolithic, trade networks linked local groups ona subcontinental scale. It is true that these institutionscan be scaled up considerably with a more productive economy than hunting and gathering. The Turkana, in our example in sect. 5.1, use a subsistence economybased on livestock raising and trade to support a societynumbering around one million with institutions hardly dif-ferent from those of most forager societies. It is the largestsociety known to us that remains without formal leadershipinstitutions, although people vary greatly in prestige. Mostsocieties larger than a few thousand people evolve formalinstitutions of leadership and governance. We argue thatculture-led gene-culture coevolution had extensively re-modeled our social psychology some time before 50,000years ago. We agree with Tooby & Cosmides that major new genetic adaptations supporting the formation of giantsocieties are unlikely to have occurred during the last5,000 years (although minor adjustments may have). Itseems likely that large-scale societies arose through aprocess of institutional innovation, which we understandin some detail in particular cases (e.g., Currie et al.2010 ). In section 6, we pointed to evidence that language, social control, and religion and ritual all show evidence of\"design \"features consistent with the operation of CGS. Tooby & Cosmides andKrasnow & Delton seem to suggest that the study of cultural evolution should be post-poned until research in evolutionary psychology has re-vealed whether or not the patterns observed can beentirely explained by evolved cognitive mechanisms. Butthat is not how science works. Darwin 's explanation of evo- lution based on heritable variation was valuable eventhough his theory of inheritance was wrong. Even todayour understanding of the genetic inheritance system is in-complete. Krasnow & Delton contrast the \"detailed, unique, and novel predictions \"of Evolutionary Psychology 1 with the \"retrodictions \"of CGS of facts we already know, such as why humans have languages. Privileging prediction over retrodiction in in this way leads to some odd conclu-sions. Would they disparage Darwin 's work on the Origin of Species because he was merely retrodicting facts he already knew -that species existed and are generally well adapted to their environments? Science often makesgood progress when some components of the phenomenonbeing studied have to be treated like black boxes. Such in-vestigations motivate and guide the science that aims toopen up the boxes. We are as enthusiastic about the adaptationist approach to human behavior as Krasnow & Delton . Boyd and Richerson 's(1985 ) book is basically an extended evolution- ary analysis of how human culture functions as an adapta-tion. To do this analysis properly, you have to take intoaccount the population-level properties of culture, just asyou have to take the population-level properties of genesinto account to understand organic evolution. The theoret-ical work outlined in sect. 2 suggests that one peculiarity ofthe cultural inheritance system is that it can support consid-erable variation at the level of groups, and accordingly thatit can support the evolution of group functions if there iscompetition between groups. The target article is mostlyan empirical sketch of the evidence available on these axi-omatic points. Krasnow & Delton do not impugn thisResponse/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 50 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59evidence. Their objections depend upon an argument based on G. C. Williams '(1966 ) gene-centered view of evo- lution, a view that he subsequently modi ed (Williams 1992 ) to include the idea of multi-level selection, based on the work of Price ( 1970 ;1972 ). Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry ( 1995 ) attributed the major transitions of evolu- tion (including human origins) to rare innovations that led to the operation of selection at higher levels. Regardingparsimony, recall Einstein 's dictum \"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler. \"Trying to understand human evolution without taking into accountthe population-level properties of culture is to use toosimple a framework. The eld of Evolutionary Psychology, pioneered by Tooby and Cosmides ( 1989 ;1992 ), has received much crit- icism for the narrowness of its program (e.g., Bolhuis et al.2011 ), but their enterprise ts well into a larger evolution- ary science of human behavior along the lines of Henrich & Boyd 's commentary. Barrett 's(2015 ) recent book, and work such as Gervais et al. ( 2011 ), show how naturally psy- chological and population based approaches t together. In this regard Buss '(2014 ) textbook Evolutionary Psychology , cited by Krasnow & Delton , is interesting in that it does not contain a discussion of the human social learningsystem that has been well described by developmentaland comparative psychologists (sect. 3.1). This is an oddomission, given that the human social learning system isperhaps the best-described human cognitive moduleknown to have evolved considerably during the Pleistocene.There is also no discussion of institutions or norms in Buss(2014 ). We appreciate Su\u00e1rez & Koenig 's raising the evidence on the selectivity of even young children 's social learning. The broader theory of cultural evolution (e.g., Boyd &Richerson 1985 ; Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman 1981 ) devel- oped mathematical models to investigate the effect onsocial learning selectivity based on genetic predispositionsand social learning selectivity based on earlier acquiredculture. These early models of bias were derived from the literature on persuasion and the acquisition of innova- tions by adults. The more recent studies of social learningin children have lled important gaps. The idea that chil- dren are evaluating potential role models for expertise,truthfulness, conformity to norms, and af liation with the child 's group are important planks in the Tribal Social In- stincts hypothesis, showing that children do favor prosocialand in-group models. This, we suggest, re flects an evolu- tionary history of living in norm- and institution-bound so-cieties, which create a tendency for norms and institutionsto culturally evolve in prosocial directions. We are also in-terested in the variation in children 's social learning biases. In section R4 we noted that young adults vary sub-stantially in their strategies in the Public Goods Game.When these young adults were younger, would they havehad different social learning biases that led them toacquire a different set of moral norms? This is consistent with the idea that selection of prosocial tendencies under CGS will be frequency dependent. The rational component of children 's imitation may tend to smooth out intergroup differences. However, it is impor-tant to remember the observation of Harris ( 2012 ) that in many matters children have so little knowledge that theymust accept the testimony of adults. In the case ofcomplex artifacts and institutions, even adult experts donot seem to have deep causal knowledge of how these cul- tural constructs function (Sterelny 2012 ). Such causal opacity will remove much of the in fluence of rational choices, and causal clarity will make such choices very pow-erful. In laboratory experiments with young adults, payoff-biased social learning strategies are commonly used if sufcient information is available, and more conformity is used when information is less de nitive (McElreath et al. 2008 ). Vigil & Kruger 's suggestion that honest communication of pain is an important part of social life is plausible. It par-allels the argument we made for the case of language insection 6.1. More generally, it is common for people tosignal their emotional states, positive as well as negative.Signaling systems in which self-interested deception is pos-sible can evolve only if there is a certain level of trustbetween senders and receivers of signals, especially if thesignals are inexpensive. Expressions of pain often triggerhelping behavior in others. This is a reliable reaction. Ithas led to the development of the strategy of terroristbombers to set off a second bomb as people rush in toaid the victims of the rst. Images of the pain suffered by a particular group are used to recruit charitable donationsand volunteers to aid them in natural disasters and wars.Vigil & Kruger provide evidence that people who identifywith an in-group can be powerfully affected by images ofharm done to in-group members. At the same time, somepeople exaggerate their suffering to attract aid they donot deserve, and such behavior is disparaged and policedmuch like any other lie. R7. Individual-level processes are important Several commentaries remind us that cultural evolution includes many phenomena that are distantly, if at all, con-nected to group-level processes. Most cultural evolutionaryanalysis asks how individual-level decisions affect the evolu-tion of culture where the agents making the decisions areassumed to be boundedly rational individuals pursuingtheir inclusive tness interest (e.g., Boyd & Richerson 1985 ). In this regard we endorse many of the remarks in the commentaries of Amir, Jordan, & Rand (Amir et al. );Singh, Glowacki, & Wrangham (Singh et al. ); ;Houdek & Novakova ; and Nesse . However, when it comes to human social life, we are con-vinced that individual-level processes are often heavily in-fluenced by the products of CGS processes. Amir et al. present an excellent model of individual de- cision-making that we think is largely compatible with CGS.In their social heuristics hypothesis (SHH), Amir et al.argue that individuals internalize the strategies that are typ-ically advantageous in daily life. We argue that institutionssubstantially determine which strategies are typically ad-vantageous. Institutions are group-level traits that evolvedue to CGS (sect. 4.3). Amir et al. give the example ofhow voting institutions might guide individual behavior.Importantly, voting institutions, and social choice institu- tions more generally, vary widely across groups, even across modern democratic states. While individual behaviormight be explained by SHH, given a particular set of votinginstitutions, voting institutions themselves are group-leveltraits because an individual cannot unilaterally decide touse different voting rules than the rest of her group.Since voting institutions can only change at the groupResponse/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 51http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59level, they are subject to CGS. If, as Amir et al. suggest, in- dividuals can migrate to join groups with voting institutionsmore to their liking, this would be a mechanism by whichCGS could operate (sect. 2.1). Additionally, Amir et al. 's idea that institutions homogenize individual behavior isprecisely what potentiates CGS processes by suppressing individual-level variation and creating group-level variation. Because sanctions and rewards can stabilize institutionsthat have highly variable functionality, institutional innova-tors cannot easily move from suboptimal to optimal institu-tions (see sect. 4.3). In summary, we see SHH as a theory toexplain human behavior, given variation in norms, institu-tions, and innate predispositions, whereas CGS andgene-culture coevolution aim to explain norms, institutions,and innate predispositions themselves. An important futureproject might be formally integrating ideas from SHH andCGS to more tightly link gene-culture coevolutionarymodels with the ndings of cross-cultural experimental psy- chology and economics. Both Singh et al. , and Houdek & Novakova make claims about how endogenous processes of cultural changewill affect the emergence of group-bene cial institutions. Singh et al. argue that endogenous processes of culturalchange can lead to norms that are group bene cial because the interest of powerful leaders align with the inter-est of the group. They therefore argue that CGS is unneces-sary for explaining group-bene cial institutions. In contrast, Houdek & Novakova point to the several pathways by whichthe action of self-interested actors can wreck the success of agroup. We agree that punishment can sustain antisocialbehavior as readily as it can sustain prosocial behavior andknow that history is rife with examples of coercive, extractiveinstitutions that were not optimal for the group, but bene t- ed the people imposing these rules (e.g., Turchin & Nefedov2009 ). And we argue that this is exactly why the processes of CGS are needed to explain the unusual level of prosocialoutcomes that we do see in human societies, such as proper-ty rights, redistributive mechanisms, safety nets for thosestruck by misfortunes, military defense, and public capital facilities. We think the diversity of opinion on this issue re flects the reality that both self-interest and cooperation do occur.Self-interested actors maneuver rules to their advantage,as evidenced by the corruption that plagues many institu-tions. Furthermore, individuals with more bargainingpower in a situation -people with wealth, in fluence, coer- cive authority, weapons, private militias, family ties, socialconnections, and so forth -will try to extract more for themselves. Such a situation often leads to rules and out-comes that are not bene cial for the group. In fact, it is seldom (if ever) the case that rules and outcomes that areoptimal for the group are achieved. If self-interested leaders often create rules that also happen to bene t the group, as Singh et al. argue, shouldn 't group-bene cial outcomes be widespread in animals? Hierarchies and power differences are extremelycommon in social animals. Yet, the presence of powerfulindividuals with coercive capacity has not created animalsocieties with complex rules for solving public goods prob-lems, or enforcing property rights, or any of the myriadother forms of cooperation commonplace in human socie-ties. When cooperative outcomes are observed in animalsocieties, they are typically among kin. Singh et al. do notconsider the full strategy space of rules that are availableto self-interested leaders. They bring up the example of Cheyenne leaders, who implemented a rule regardingthieving of horses: \"Now we shall make a new rule. There shall be no more borrowing of horses without asking. ... [If] the taker tries to keep them, we will give him a whip-ping. \"They conclude that the leaders impose such a rule because preventing theft and maintaining social order ben- ets the leaders. But wouldn 't a rule in which the leader takes this stolen horse for himself bene t the leader even more? What about a rule requiring such thieves to handover their wives to the leader? Or a rule that says that thepunishment only applies to people the leader does notlike? Let us assume for a moment that leaders do alwaysattempt to establish rules in their own interest. Neverthe-less, they will occasionally make rules favoring group inter-ests either because of an alignment of elite and non-elitepreferences, or because of errors of judgment or exogenouschanges. No matter the intent of the original rule-makers,CGS processes will act to favor such rules and disfavorrules that are actually sel sh. We do not want to say that the interests of leaders and followers never align withoutevolved institutional incentives, just that this mechanismalone can only account for the limited amounts cooperationfound in societies with dominance hierarchies. Tooby & Cosmides speculate that modern institutions can be far better explained by neural adaptations indense persisting social networks of intelligent culturalagents than by CGS. Once again, one cannot discuss indi-vidual behavior without considering the possibility thathumans have adapted by gene-culture coevolution to livein societies shaped by CGS. As we discussed in sectionR4, it takes a largish minority of altruistic punishers to es-tablish cooperation in laboratory public goods games, con-sistent with CGS models (Boyd et al. 2003 ). In societies with poor institutions, experimental participants can 't es- tablish cooperation using the punishment tool (Herrmannet al. 2008 ). Leaders are leaders either by virtue of coercive power or by grants of prestige from their followers, or both.Prestige is a strong motivator of behavior (Henrich & Gil- White 2001 ), and even the powerful may act in the group interest to gain prestige. Also, sel sh political operators can't advocate for new institutions based on sel sh advan- tage unless they are dictators. To the extent that theyneed the consent or at least the acquiescence of others,they will at least need to convince followers that the inno-vation is in the group 's interest even if the group is only a narrow ruling class. If the new institution turns out to beonly in the leaders 'interests, their prestige and perhaps au- thority will often by diminished by unpopularity, resistance,and revolt (Insko et al. 1983 ). Thus, endogenous processes can aid in the creation of group-bene cial institutions, but for this to work on any scale, the prosocial instincts wouldhave had to be favored by some process like CGS actingvia gene-culture coevolution in the past. Nesse brings up the very important concept of social se- lection. Certainly many non-human social phenomena areshaped by social selection. Indeed, it seems likely that inany social species social selection plays an important role.For example, the mutual grooming seen in many socialmammals must be the product of social selection disfavor-ing individuals who were unacceptably rough or ticklish.The very ubiquity of social selection argues against itbeing capable, on its own, of generating societies of thesize and complexity of human societies. Runaway sexualResponse/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 52 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59selection is a common phenomenon. If a runaway form of partner choice social selection were possible, shouldn 'tw e see many non-human societies with extensive cooperationbetween non-relatives? As we argued in sections 2, 4.3,and 6.2 of the target article, culturally transmitted institu-tions act to greatly amplify social section. They are rules that deliver rewards and sanctions to individuals, they vary substantially from society to society, and they in fluence the outcome of inter-organizational competition. We thinkit is CGS on institutions that put on a runaway pathto semi-domestication. Pleistocene culture-driven gene-culture coevolution would have favored the ofguilt, pity, commitment, empathy, and generosity, muchas Darwin ( 1874 ) imagined in the epigraph from The Descent of Man at the start of our target article. As we elab- orate in sections R10 here and 4.3 in the target article, eventhe ubiquitous simple partnerships, like marriage andtrade, are heavily institutionalized even in simple societies. Lamba describes a eld study of variation in cooperation (measured by an experimental public goods game) in asample of 14 villages within an ethnic group in India(Lamba & Mace 2011 ). Some of this variation could be ex- plained statistically by population size, age, and sex, whichLamba attributes causally to individual-level effects. As faras we can see, it could also involve some component ofmicro-cultural variation, for example, norms of cooperationmight differ by gender. However, all experimental gamestudies we know of nd ample individual-level variation, in- cluding the studies ( 2012a ) report that the variation between communities, estimated for some but not all of theirsamples of societies, is approximately the same as the vari-ation that Lamba and Mace ( 2011 ) reported and is rather smaller than the between-cultures variation in theHenrich et al. studies. We do not doubt that as the scaleof measurement of variation shrinks, individual-leveleffects will become increasingly important, all the moreso to the extent that cultural variation is concentrated at alarger scale. If people in a regional-scale society all operate under the same institutions, perhaps the main sources of individual variation in behavior are environmen-tal and genetic. Lamba ( 2014 ) also reports nding only modest effects of cultural transmission as measured bychanges in individuals 'behavior between two rounds of a one-shot public goods game. In the second round, some in-dividuals tended to conform to the mean contribution intherst round and some tended to adopt the payoff- maximizing contribution, but there was a strong mode atno change. This nding is in line with laboratory studies of social learning (e.g., McElreath et al. 2008 ). A major lim- itation of such studies is that one brief social learning expe-rience cannot be expected to have a large impact on habitsand norms that have been acquired over a lifetime. The ex-periments reported in section 4.2 of the target article showthat children acquire norms quite readily. R8. On what units does CGS operate? Some authors raise important issues concerning the units and levels of selection. As we remarked in section 1, theCGS framework can be applied to many different concreteentities; it includes the concept of multi-level selection. It isapplicable to easily copied fragments of culture (whichWhiten & Erdal call\"meme-complexes \"); to structural el- ements within a population, such as business organizations(discussed in sect. 5.2); to ethnolinguistic groups, corporatekin groups, clubs, nations, religions; and to multi-ethnic empires (Turchin 2009 ). Whiten & Erdal suggest that the relevant groups for CGS should be groups of cultural replicators (meme-complexes), rather than groups of people. W hile meme-complexes, like other cultural traits, can var y between groups or increase a n dd e c r e a s ei nf r e q u e n c ya sp a r to faC G Sp r o c e s s ,i nt h eCGS framework, they are not the groups themselves.However, if meme-complexes are self-reinforcing, they maybecome particularly stable within groups once adopted, similar to Smaldino 's(2014 )c o n c e p to fa \"group level trait. \" Groups may, as a result, become strongly in fluenced by partic- ular meme-complexes, and cultural group selection mayoperate on meme-complexes with particular force. When applying the CGS framework to a particular case, we think it is as important to analyze the ecology of compe-tition and cooperation when de ning groups as it is to analyze the patterns of cultural variation. CGS is likely tobe operating where there is a coincidence of a pattern ofcultural variation and a pattern of con flict.Lamba seems to suggest that ethnolinguistic groups have a privileged position in the CGS framework. That is not our view.She nds considerable variation in cooperative behavior within the ethnic group she studied, partly related to demo-graphic and ecological processes. This is not surprisingonce one takes into account the relevant scales of collectiveaction for the traits she examines. For example, Lamba de-scribes an experiment where villagers are asked to divide ameasure of salt between themselves and other villagers. Ifsalt division is a collective action problem typically encoun-tered at the scale of villages, then villages would be the rel-evant group in the CGS framework. The ethnolinguisticgroup would not be the relevant group unless theproblem of salt division could be solved by collectiveaction at that larger scale. Similarly, one of the beststudied possible examples of CGS is warfare between clans within ethnic groups in Highland New Guinea (Soltis et al. 1995 ).Mace & Silva andAcedo-Carmona & Gomila also describe eld situations in which the locus of cooperation and con flict is at smaller scales than what a Western anthropologist might de ne as a cultural group. In section 5.1 we described the cooperation andcompetition among the Turkana which are organized atthe level of a large ethnic group. In section 5.2 we discussedbusiness organizations that are typically subnational inscale, although large modern rms are often multinational in their operations and multi-ethnic in their staff. Clearly,human societies are both complex and diverse. Doing fulljustice to this diversity is beyond the scope of our targetarticle, but we would not want to be misunderstood asthinking that the CGS approach is committed to a particu-lar claim about the kinds of groups that compete. Acedo-Carmona & Gomila raise the important issue of the persistence of medium-scale diversity within state-levelsocieties. They argue that CGS predicts regional culturalhomogenization in the long run, and that such homogeniza-tion does not occur in their cases in Oaxaca and NorthernGhana. This is not quite right because, while it is truethat, in a stable environment, a simple CGS model predictsthat competing groups will have similar group success atequilibrium, social evolution is a complex design problemResponse/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 53http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59(Boyd & Richerson 1992a ). There are likely to be many equally successful but rather different ways of organizingsocieties. Furthermore, medium-sized organizations oftenevolve better institutions from the bottom up than can becreated by top-down organizations like nation-states(Ostrom 2005 ). CGS for cooperative institutions at the scale of neighborhoods, villages, churches, business organi- zations, and the like probably often favors institutions thatprotect the local autonomy of medium-sized organizationswhich are successful at solving a particular problem. Forexample, around Lake Titicaca, Peruvian lakeside villagersactively defend shing territories that are completely illegal under Peruvian law. Yet they succeed in defending theserights against trespass by neighboring villagers, interfer-ence from state of cials, and use by state-sanctioned private companies (Levieil & Orlove 1990 ). Multiple equi- libria in complex systems and relative ef ciency of medium- scale organization will therefore counter the homogenizingtendency of CGS and preserve medium-scale diversitywithin bigger units like states or ethnolinguistic groups. Santana, Patel, Chang, & Weisberg (Santana et al. ) make a similar argument focused on the phenomenon ofreligious syncretism. They point out that selective con-quest, migration, or imitation seldom results in total re-placement of pre-existing culture. More often there is anew hybrid culture, a process sometimes called \"ethnogen- esis.\"Among other things, ethnogenesis offers the possibil- ity of cultural recombination, discovering favorable newcombinations of cultural traits not present in either of thecontributing lineages. As Santana et al. correctly observe,there must be evidence that traits acquired or retainedduring ethnogenesis actually had group functional effectsthat drove acquisition or retention if we are to attributetheir evolution to CGS. We pointed to literatures insection 5 that document how competing organizationsuse techniques such as head-hunting and espionage inhighly organized ways to acquire the successful techniquesof rivals. (For the borrowing of military technology, see Ho-rowitz [ 2010 ].) Still, Santana et al. are surely correct that many cultural traits spread between groups or are retained in ethnogenesis for their individual-level functions, not tomention the frequent diffusion of harmful practices suchas tobacco smoking and the consumption of fast food.The quantitative study they suggest to examine the levelsof organization that are affected by a sample of diffusing in-novations would be very interesting. Santana et al. 's case of the Catholic veneer adopted by local Mexican communities is an interesting examplerelated to those described by Acedo-Carmona & Gomila . As Foster 's(1960 ) classic account of America 's Spanish heritage documented, the pattern of highly hetero-dox local beliefs in America replicates a pattern found inSpain, despite energetic and largely successful attemptsby colonial authorities to prevent the spread of unorthodoxreligious ideas from Spain to the New World. Again, localdifferentiation of beliefs could be related to multi-levelCGS favoring one set of institutions at the village scale cor-related with local heterodox religious beliefs and anotherassociated with Catholic orthodoxy among national elites.As we discuss in section 6.3, religions seem to function toprovide symbolic group boundaries, moral justi cations for institutions, and rituals that express group solidarity.The\"veneer \"inter-level relationship between elite Catho- lic orthodoxy and village-level heterodoxy is particularlywell studied in the case of the New Mexican Pueblos. The Pueblo peoples resisted Spanish domination violently,culminating in a spectacularly, if temporarily, successfulrevolt in 1680. The Spanish returned 12 years later muchchastened. \"Veneer \"Catholicism symbolized the Pueb- loans 'acquiescence to Spanish overlordship in exchange for a Spanish tolerance of substantial Pueblo autonomy, an arrangement that persisted under Mexican and U.S.rule (Simmons 1979 ). Regarding Mace & Silva 's Northern Ireland case study (Silva & Mace 2014 ), we appreciate their raising the issue of parochial altruism. Some plau sible CGS models do predict the evolution of a combination of in-group cooperation andout-group hate, but in section 4.2 we dissociated ourselvesfrom the view that this relatio nship is a necessary product of CGS in general. Empirically, no law-like associationbetween in-group cooperation and out-group dislike hasbeen found (Brewer 2007 ). This is not hard to understand. Peaceful relations between gro ups make possible gains from trade while warring with neighbors is generally negativesum, costly to both sides. Only in very asymmetric con flicts or surprise attacks are aggressors reasonably certain to comeout ahead and in the case of surprise attacks, victory isusually temporary. Large organizations, like states andempires, often offer mediation or legal services to settle dis-putes between the smaller organ izations they contain. When such services are ef cient and just, the constituent organiza- tions are typically happy with the results (North et al. 2009 ). In simple societies, the lack of mediation institutions canlead a society toward extinction, at least in a competitive envi-ronment (Knauft 1985 ). Even in cases where enmities are raw and deep-seated, as in Northern Ireland, mediation by the United Kingdom and Ireland, as sisted by the United States, eventually damped down violent con flict there. De Dreu & Balliet 's point that intergroup interactions are mixed motive rather than zero sum is likewise appreci-ated. Groups that trade and make peace may also be com-petitors. Thus, rms in an industry may come together to form a trade group that lobbies, advertises, and does re- search to bene t the industry as a whole, while still compet- ing vigorously on price, quality, and so forth. In ourexample of the 19th century dye industry in section 5.2, itwas cooperation between competing German rms to lobby states to create research professorships in chemistrythat gave German rms collectively a decisive advantage over their British rivals. Societies nd it expedient to ally with others to ght a threatening common enemy even if they continue to compete vigorously in other spheres.Any organization that does not have a robust set of institu-tions to make possible trade and alliance is liable to be out-competed by ones that do. The Comanche dominated theSouthern Plains of North America militarily for a coupleof centuries in part because they made alliances andtrade relations with other Indian tribes and with Europeans(H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2008 ). A tight coupling between in-group love and out-group hate would make alliance-forming dif - cult, something that CGS is likely to disfavor, all else equal.Models also exist which show cooperation arising in a gameto survive in harsh unstable environments, even in theabsence of con flict between groups (Smaldino et al. 2013 ). A failure to cooperate may lead to group extinction due to a failure to extract suf cient resources to maintain a viable population, even in the absence of competition. Wedo not classify this as a form of CGS because it does notResponse/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 54 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59involve between-group variation and inter-group competi- tion, but that does not mean it is unimportant in favoringgroup-level cooperation. This process would also tend toproduce in-group love but not out-group hate. Herzog proposes that pet-keeping can best be explained by CGS. He presents no obvious group tness bene ts of pet-keeping. The best evidence provided suggests only that, as the author states, pet-keeping is like fashion, andit spreads through cultural transmission. It is in fluenced by parental preferences, prestige, and conformity. Pet-keeping is apparently not a cultural trait that is appreciablyinfluenced by CGS processes. The fact that people readily form attachments to pets illustrates how flexible the human attachment system is, but the capacity to form attachmentsto social groups is a much more consequential example forCGS processes. R9. Variations in the strength of CGS Commentators Gelfand, Roos, Nau, Harrington, Mu, & Jackson 's(Gelfand et al. 's) point that the strength of CGS processes will vary as a function of the threats a societyfaces makes sense. Some of the changes in the commitmentto groups are short term in nature, for example, the com-pulsory mobilization of a society ghting an existential war. The Mu et al. ( 2015 ) study shows that priming subjects to think of an out-group threat immediately increases coop-eration. These are the sorts of psychological predispositionsthat might result from a long evolutionary history of groupliving (sect. 2.2). Boehm 's(1984 ) study of Montenegrin feuding described institutions for suspending feuds when it was necessary to raise a tribal army to fend off Muslim in-vaders. Montenegrins 'willingness to suspend feuds was no doubt aided by the clear danger to the whole society posedby potential Muslim conquest. Other changes are longerterm, as evidenced by institutional differences acrossAmerican states. Some scholars have argued that these dif-ferences have a historical character derived from patternsof colonial immigration from different parts of Britain(Fischer 1989 ; Nisbett & Cohen 1996 ). Immigrants may also settle in regions and situations to which their normsand institutions are adapted, making the correlations inthe Mu et al. study hard to interpret causally, as Gelfandet al. recognize. The role of possible genetic adaptationsto living in tight versus loose societies is interesting, butthe arrow of causation also has to be established. Humangenetic diversity is strongly correlated with distance fromAfrica, implying that drift was a strong factor in our evolu-tion (Pickrell & Reich 2014 ). Institutions might coevolve with gene frequency differences that were a product ofchance factors. Ancient DNA can be used to characterizethe genotypes of people before and during a putativeculture-caused selective sweep and hence rule out the pos-sibility that a pre-existing genetic difference in fluenced cul- tural evolution (Itan et al. 2009 ). R10. Ancient preadaptations It goes without saying that human culture and CGS pro- cesses rest on ancient roots. Even something as novel asour capacity to form large-scale societies is likely to be amere modi cation of traits present in our ancestors.Chisholm, Coall, & Atkinson (Chisholm et al. ) offer mother -infant attachment as an example. This is a bond that is practically required by mammals and is thus phylo-genetically ancient. It is one that has been remodeled formany different purposes in the course of social evolution,just as Chisholm et al. argue. See also Panksepp and Biven (2012 , Chapters 8 -10). Attachment to groups, for example, looks as if it depends upon some of the same subcorticalroots as individual -individual attachments (Haslam 2001 ). Burkart & van Schaik argue that cooperative breeding provides a much more recent precursor of why humansrather than some other great ape evolved into the hyper-co-operative niche. The comparative primatology of coopera-tive breeding is certainly striking, as their experimentsshow. Both generalized cooperation and social learningappear to be enhanced in cooperative breeders. Cooperativebreeding is certainly a candidate to have favored more coop-eration in early hominins and to have ampli ed the advantag- es of social learning by exposing selective learners to agreater number of potentially useful cultural variants.Larger social groups could also have favored improved com-munication. Our only worry is our original one in the targetarticle (sect. 1) that the paleoanthropological record is almostsilent on the evolution of social organization. Stiner andKuhn ( 2009 ) argue from diet and artifact types that a sexual division of labor did not evolve until the Upper Paleo-lithic, suggesting that large-brained hominins, closely relatedto modern humans, had very different social organization. Human cooperative breeding is heavily institutionalized in ethnographically known small-scale societies by rulesabout kinship and marriage. Mathew et al. ( 2013 ) suggest that the human capacity to cooperate in many different ac-tivities is based on our ability to create institutions tomanage diverse forms of cooperation (see sect. 4.3 of thetarget article). Thus, an alternative hypothesis is thatsimple institutions preceded cooperative breeding inhumans and made it possible. Perhaps families were oneof the earliest social institutions. On present evidenceboth hypotheses seem equally plausible, not to mention any number of more complex coevolutionary scenarios one can imagine in which genes and culture played alter-nating leading and lagging roles. R11. Pleistocene adaptations , and Whiten & Erdal observe that the target article includes little mention of CGS and culture-driven gene-culture coevolution in thePleistocene. They outline several examples of adaptationsthat may very well have been built by these processes farearlier than the examples we discuss. We agree that theseare good candidates to be explained by CGS and culture-driven gene-culture coevolution along the lines of thetribal social instincts hypothesis (sect. 2.2). However, inthis article we emphasized empirical evidence that is asclose to unassailable as it is possible to get. Inevitably, this resulted in an emphasis on more recent cases. Humans seem to have been quite rare before about 50,000 yearsago (Li & Durbin 2011 ). Hence, the paleoanthropological data record is scanty and hard to interpret. Language, insti-tutions, and other traits that are central to the operation ofCGS leave poor proxies in that record. The temporal resolu-tion of the record is poor, so it is hard to be sure whetherResponse/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016) 55http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59cultural evolution is the leading or lagging variable in coevo- lutionary events. Ongoing improvements in the paleoanthro-pological record will help make hypotheses about deep timeevents more testable, and there is great promise for extract-ing more genetic history from living autosomal DNA, sup-plemented by recovery of subfossil DNA (Richerson et al. 2010 ). Gintis, Fuentes & Kissel ,and Whiten & Erdal raise questions about the most important events in our evolution-ary history. We look forward to advances that will help usbetter understand them. R12. Relationship of CGS to the expanded evolutionary synthesis We thank Fuentes & Kissel for raising the issue of the re- lationship between CGS and the extended evolutionarysynthesis (EES). We are quite willing to include CGS aspart of the EES. Cultural evolutionists often cite and arecited by other EES authors. For example, we citedLaland et al. ( 2010 ;2011 ) in our target article, and both of these papers cite numerous publications by other cultur-al evolutionists. If our tribal social instincts hypothesis iscorrect, the evolution of the cultural inheritance systemunder CGS had major impacts on the genetic componentof our social psychology, not to mention many otheraspects of our phenotype. Two of the three CGS mecha-nisms we discuss are based on selective decisions, notnatural selection, and as we have remarked here insection R4, individual and collective decisions regarding in-stitutional innovation and adoption are potentially biased in a prosocial direction due to the ancient remodeling of our social psychology by CGS. In section 6.2, we discussedthe genetic evolutionary effect that punishment on deviantswould have if indeed there is (or was) genetic variation intendencies to deviate from the strictures of norms and in-stitutions. Barclay & Krupp defend a decidedly non- EES picture in their remark that proponents of CGS areconfusing proximate and ultimate causation. Exactly whois confused is the central issue in the debate over EES.For those who accept the evidence for culture-led gene-culture coevolution, it is the opponents of the CGS whoare confused (Laland et al. 2011 ). R13. Selection of extended behavior patterns Simon makes a useful point in her commentary that selec- tion on patterns of behavior has to consider the effects ontness that accrue over time and across individuals. Individ- uals may pay a cost for being prosocial at one time but berewarded later because they had achieved a reputationfor generosity. Carriers of a cultural variant or genotype en-couraging generosity may incur a net lifetime cost not paidby the ungenerous. In the case of such an altruistic group-selected trait, generosity may increase because even thoughit is counter-selected within every group where it is present, the success of groups with many generous types relative to those with few can result in the generous trait increasing infrequency in the meta-population. Thus, Simon is not quitecorrect to say that \"cooperation ...was selected because it commonly enhanced the individual 's long-term tness \"in the sense that there is, by de nition, always a within- group disadvantage to altruistic generosity.Much of evolutionary theory is devoted to understanding how selection trades off costs and bene ts of extended pat- terns of behavior. Life history theory studies how the effectof sacri ce of reproduction at one stage of the life history can or cannot be favored by increased reproduction atanother stage. Evolution in temporally varying environ- ments will tend to favor types that have lower mean tness in good times but that resist having very low tness in bad times. We did not consider these important issues in our target article in favor of issues more directlyrelevant to the evolution of cooperation. As Equation 1 in section 4.1 depicts, in the context of multi-level selection,the ratio of group bene ts to individual costs that can be favored by group selection depends upon the ratio ofwithin-group to between-group heritable variation for thetrait concerned. R14. The evidence is incomplete Commentators Mace & Silva ,Barclay & Krupp , and Turchin & Currie remark that the evidence supporting CGS is inadequate to support any strong claims for the utility of the framework. Mace & Silva point out that the case for CGS to the exclusion of other explanations ishard to prove. We feel that there is no need to prove thecase to the exclusion of all other processes that in fluence or may in fluence human behavior. Given that human soci- eties are complex and diverse, we do not expect a singlemodel derived from the CGS framework, or any otherframework, to provide a complete and universal explana-tion. In many cases, competing hypotheses or models arenot mutually exclusive. Barclay & Krupp say that we have established that CGS processes are plausible, but that we have not shown that aparticular group trait was caused by cultural transmissionand directly caused differences in group tness. We did point to evidence that norms are transmitted (see sects. 3and 4.2) and that the outcomes of competition are often ex-plained by institutional and other cultural differencesbetween groups (sect. 5). Institutions are group-leveltraits by their nature (see sect. R5 here). We havepointed to a small selection of concrete empirical cases inour article and additional ones in this response, butBarclay & Krupp are right that in no particular case canwe put all the pieces of a complete CGS explanation togeth-er. This is a serious problem in the science of evolution gen-erally (Brandon 1994 ). Biologists know a lot about genetic transmission, mainly from laboratory studies, and a lotabout the evolution of phenotypic characters in the wild,but in most cases, connecting genes to phenotypic charac-ters has proven dif cult. Many good studies of the transmis- sion of norms have been done, and the role of institutions ininter-organizational competition has also been well-studied. But it is hard to conceive of a study that wouldallow us to understand how a complex institution is built from the ground up by the social learning of norms. The complexity of cultural inheritance and of cultural evolutionprecludes easy progress on many important questions. Evo-lutionary biology is still a thriving scienti c eld 155 years after the Origin of Species ; we do not think the study of cul- tural evolution will be a perfected science a century fromnow.Response/ Richerson et al.: Cultural group selection plays an essential role in explaining human cooperation 56 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES, 39 (2016)http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 10 Mar 2016 IP address: 169.237.62.59In this regard, we enthusiastically endorse the path forward painted by Turchin & Currie . The gold standard in empir- ical inference has become tting competing models to data using techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo simula-tions and testing the goodness of t of these models to data using Bayesian and information theoretic measures (e.g., Gerbault et al. 2014 ). Advances in genomics have furnished huge amounts of historical data on the course of evolution.Human languages, living and dead, have long been minedfor human historical information, and to some extant non-lin-guistic data have been used as well (see sect. 3.2). As Turchin& Currie suggest, archaeological and historical data can surelybe assembled into databases that can support model- tting and model-comparison approaches. R15. Conclusion Our commentators made many useful addenda to the main argument in the target article but also introduced a numberof caveats. They retained varying degrees of skepticism aboutthe reality of the CGS processes. However, none of the skep-tics addressed the empirical foundations for applying theDarwinian syllogism to human groups, except in special cases. In the target article we presented evidence that: 1. Human groups often differ culturally. 2. Cultural variation is transmitted from generation to gen- eration by social learning. 3. Success in intergroup competition is frequently deter- mined by cultural differences. We included only a small proportion of the vast amount of evidence that exists to support these statements. We at-tempted to select the best and admit that the quality ofthis evidence varies. However, consider the possibility of ap-plying the CGS framework to non-human species, even theother great apes. Chimpanzee groups have appreciableamounts of cultural variation, including traditional differ-ences in social customs like grooming (Whiten et al. 1999 ). Chimpanzees are comparatively good social learners, asjudged by the standards of other non-human animals,albeit much less adept than human children (Dean et al.2012 ; Whiten et al. 2009 ). Chimpanzee communities cer- tainly compete vigorously. But so far as we are aware,there is no evidence that success in competition is in fluenced by a cultural trait. Some whale and dolphin species also havesignicant cultural traditions. Some group selection on them is conceivable and the current evidence is suggestive(Whitehead & Rendell 2015 ). Most nonhuman social learn- ing systems are considerably less sophisticated than those ofchimpanzees and dolphins. No other vertebrate species hassocieties that compare to those of humans in size and orga-nizational complexity. Certainly, skeptics about the impor-tance of CGS processes in other species can raise strongdoubts about their role. Only in humans is there abundant,if not always unassailable, evidence for all of the legs of the Darwinian syllogism operating at the group level. NOTE 1.
