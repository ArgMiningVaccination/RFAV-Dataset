Industry AgendaThe Global Health and Healthcare Governors define the industry agenda. The group, comprising chief executives and chairs from partner organizations, closely align the agenda with the System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Health and Healthcare.The Governors identified three priority challenges for 2017: Accelerating value-based healthcare, contributing to universal health coverage, and advancing precision medicine. The Forum is addressing these challenges through a number of projects and activities:1. Accelerating value-based healthcareThe Value in Healthcare project aims to stimulate healthcare reform by identifying how to deliver health outcomes that matter to patients. It does this by: Identifying the key enablers needed to support a value-based healthcare (VBHC) system. This will be achieved by defining a standardized taxonomy and conducting deep-dives and compiling case studies on VBHC implementation Running pilots to identify barriers and solutions for adopting a VBHC approach for priority therapeutic areas and population segmentsUnderstanding and resolving clinical, policy and regulatory challenges that must be overcome to achieve global VBHC adoption 2. Contributing to universal health coverageThe Primary Care Coalition project aims to improve access to healthcare by forming a coalition to develop a sustainable, affordable and proven model for primary healthcare capacity development. This model will be scalable and replicable in any context. The areas of focus include: Establishing political will to address sustainable access to primary careCreating an operating model for the Primary Care CoalitionIdentifying the leadership and next steps needed to launch and run the Primary Care Coalition 3. Advancing precision medicineThe Precision Medicine project aims to shape how emerging technologies enable more targeted and customized approaches to health and healthcare to benefit society while minimizing the risks. The areas of focus include: Developing in-depth understanding of the regulatory landscape and building agile regulatory frameworks to accelerate the integration of precision medicine into healthcare Generating ideas and recommendations for how to establish precision medicine as the driver of health and healthcare systems", "sitename": "World Economic Forum", "date": "2022-11-17", "cleaned_text": "These are the healthcare lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic Trailblazers have identified cost-effective and globally applicable disease intervention and treatment pathways born out of the experience of COVID-19. Trailblazers have identified cost-effective and globally applicable disease intervention and treatment pathways born out of the experience of COVID-19. Mucosal vaccines delivered by nose or throat as sniffable or inhalable formulations could offer long-term COVID immunity. Several are in clinical trials. Many claim that bulking and cutting stands as the best dietary method for efficiently building muscle while also losing fat - what do the experts say? A chronic lack of sleep due to these mismatched sleep schedules can explain why teens who are night owls are at greater risk for emotional and behavioral problems than ones who are mornin... COVID-19 and flu vaccinations are safe in all trimesters during pregnancy, medical experts say. Bivalent boosters can also be given during pregnancy. Multicancer early detection tests (MCEDs) could screen for most common cancers all at once. They look for trace amounts of tumour DNA in the bloodstream. Long COVID affects different people in different ways and it's important to recognize that exercise might not be suitable for all, say experts. From the optimal number of hours to the power of cognitive behavioural therapy, these 10 articles can help you find a way to a better night's sleep. Top stories: record number of cholera outbreaks worldwide; highest COVID-19 numbers in China in six months; health must be top of COP27 agenda, WHO says. Two new Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 have been identified in the UK and Europe and collectively account for 27% of current infections in the US. A well-informed public is more willing to engage with the healthcare system, enabling preventative care and treatment that is in patients' long-term interests. The mental well-being benefits associated with vaccination were heavily concentrated in the older and clinically vulnerable groups, UK researchers found. Researchers investigated known signs of pancreatic cancer - weight loss, high blood sugar and diabetes - and looked at when they develop. Climate change has a direct impact on human health, but many healthcare systems have not committed to net zero. The sector must reduce its carbon footprint. Children and young people's mental health is increasingly suffering from eco-anxiety, but getting involved in the fight against climate change can help. "}
