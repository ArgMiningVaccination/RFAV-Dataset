To be called the [Winslow Research Pavilion](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/news/release/2023/winslow-research-pavilion), the building will be located at 2850 Winslow Ave. in Avondale, near the Interstate 71 interchange with Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. The Winslow Research Pavilion will encompass nearly 45,000 square feet and house about 70 current employees - including physicians, research investigators, research nurses, coordinators, data managers, laboratory scientists and investigational pharmacists. \"The Winslow Research Pavilion will enhance our efforts to connect scientists and clinicians, which enables faster translation of discoveries from the lab to directly impacting patients,\" said Tina Cheng, MD, who is director of the Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation, chair of the Department of Pediatrics, and chief medical officer of the health system. \"This emphasis on research is one reason Cincinnati Children's is recognized as one of the most innovative organizations in America.\" The Gamble Vaccine Research Center will occupy the top two levels of the new three-story building. Outpatient studies and offices will be on Level 2, and 16 beds for adult overnight studies will be on Level 3. The Gamble Center currently conducts outpatient studies at the Schubert Research Clinic on the first floor of the Clinical Sciences Pavilion (Location T) at the Burnet Campus, and overnight vaccine studies involving adults are conducted in the Academy Building on Reading Road. The Discover Together Biobank, which occupies space at both the Cincinnati Children's Burnet Campus and the University of Cincinnati's Reading Campus, will have sample processing/distribution labs and offices on Level 1 of the Winslow Research Pavilion. The Biobank will share the floor with what will be the first centralized location at Cincinnati Children's for a freezer archive. The Biobank facilitates the acquisition, processing, storage, and distribution of biospecimens for research studies. Cincinnati Children's researchers work with the biospecimens to seek treatments or cures for diseases. Construction of the Winslow Research Pavilion will begin in early 2024, pending approvals for design, zoning, and permits. Cincinnati Children's hopes to occupy the building by mid- to "}
