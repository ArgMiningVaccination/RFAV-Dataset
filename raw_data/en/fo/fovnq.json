CooneyAAEP News May 2019 III Lessons learned: Protecting your practice from addiction threats \"If you're not seeing addictive disease in your ranks, you're not finding it,\" according to Dr. Greg Gable, executive director of the healthcare professionals program at Caron Treatment Centers, during a session on addiction in practice at the 2018 AAEP Annual Convention. AAEP Wellness Subcommittee Chairman Dr. Rob Franklin moderated the session and is intimately familiar with the topic as owner of or partner in three equine and four small animal practices in Texas. In 2014, just 12 days after being hired at one of his small animal practices, an associate operating under Dr. Franklin's DEA license overdosed on ketamine at work. In that limited time, technicians had indicated an increase in ketamine orders. Staff also noticed a different demeanor with the associate than when she previously worked part time relief shifts at the practice. Those clues \"put us on alert but we weren't sure how to deal with it,\" said Dr. Franklin. \"The lesson I learned is to be direct with the person you're concerned about. Require a drug test and have conversations with the person in question early on instead of waiting for them to try to find rock bottom in your clinic.\" When informed of the overdose, Dr. Franklin abruptly returned home from vacation to find himself entangled in months of investigations by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), local police and the Texas Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners, which probed all seven of his practices. With the immense stress of his license and livelihood being thrown into limbo, Dr. Franklin scrutinized current processes at his practices and implemented six protocols to mitigate the likelihood of a recurrent event. 1. Background check At a cost of just $5 to $10, a background check is an inex-pensive way to dig into an applicant's history to discover incidents that can tip you off to potential problems, such as a previous citation for driving under the influence or possession of illegal drugs. 2. Pre-employment drug screen In addition to drug testing potential hires, including successful passage of a drug screen (and background check) as a requirement in job postings creates a natural filter on prospective candidates with substance abuse problems. 3. Random drug screen agreement Reserve the right to randomly drug screen employees. The screen should be more comprehensive than the standard test in order to look for the types of medications on hand in the practice. Include appropriate language in the employee handbook and require new employees to sign off on their first day. \"Random drug screening is not something we do once a quarter or anything like that,\" said Dr. Franklin. \"It's really based on whether we're having any issues with our drug count or with behavior. If we're not sure where it's coming from, we'll test everyone. If there's one employee we're concerned about, we may just test that individual.\" 4. Individual DEA licenses A misstep by an associate operating through an owner's DEA license could jeopardize the owner's ability to practice. Individual licenses hold everyone accountable to the highest authority. \"It's worth the $700 every three years,\" said Dr. Franklin. 5. Strict log keeping Log keeping needs to be a shared responsibility. It can be a practice manager and lead technician, but there must be two sets of eyes on it. Dr. Franklin's practices use the AAHA controlled substances log, which is simple to use and formatted to the DEA's preference, unlike spiral notebooks. 6. Monthly controlled substances audit Dr. Franklin contends that the DEA's requirement for a controlled substances audit every two years creates vulner-abilities. \"We count everything and make sure the logs are watertight once a month. It's very easy to stay on top of it when you make it a monthly checklist item.\" According to Dr. Franklin, maintaining vigorous records, strong protocols and clear employee manuals and operating agreements between partners \"really clears the air and reduces your liability if something happens with an employee.\"ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATIONIV AAEP News May 2019 ASSOCIATION 1.

The client who owns English sport horses values different things in veterinary service than the client with a single pleasure horse. The savvy and insightful veterinarian tailors his or her approach with each client based on the client's individual needs and demographic profile. One size truly does not fit all. The AAEP Touch program offers 13 different client profiles to help you better understand the individual needs of your future clients. You can view all profiles at touch.aaep.org/8-one-size-does-not-fit-all. Although the top priorities for relationship attributes and services are consistent across all demographic groups, paying attention to the subtle differences between each client type can yield the blueprint for customizing your approach within your equine practice.

Dr. Naile, who recently sold his ownership stake in the Equine Clinic at Oakencroft and now primarily serves as practice manager of the 10-doctor practice in Ravena, N.Y., partners with Lynn Cross at Little Brook Farm horse rescue and sanctuary to offer a free, one-day Investigating Equine Cruelty and Neglect workshop at which police officers, animal control officers and other law enforcement officials from around the state are trained in the essentials of equine abuse cases. Dr. Naile instructs attendees on proper paperwork, including the Coggins test; determination and use of body condition score; and the components of a thorough site inspection, including common owner excuses and the buzzwords that, when heard, should trigger additional scrutiny. When Cross pitched the workshop idea to Dr. Naile, he called it a \"homerun\" because law enforcement can be reluctant to get involved in equine cruelty situations because of an already heavy workload and an unfamiliar-ity with horses and the applicable laws. Now in its sixth year and with more than 70 attendees in 2018, including a couple of prosecutors, the workshop has been a grand slam. \"I've seen such an improvement in the competence of law enforcement and animal control people,\" said Dr. Naile. The workshops have also established an ongoing connection between attendees and organizers. Dr. Naile volunteers his availability, including nights and weekends, to officers investigating cruelty complaints or seeking assistance. \"I believe I may be the only one who knows just how much time he spends quietly working behind the scenes to aid these horses\u2014not recognized or compensated but definitely appreciated by those he's helping,\" said Cross, who nominated Dr. Naile for the Good Works honor. The payout for Dr. Naile is the growing network of motivated officers equipped to address and resolve situations before they become welfare emergencies. \"For every high-profile case of equine cruelty and neglect, there are many more out there that don't get publicity because they don't involve large numbers or a particular breed,\" said Dr. Naile. \"The eyes and ears are not only the neighbors but the animal control officers and police on routine patrols on the backroads and byways who can spot these animals before they reach a critical condition.\" The workshop is part of the Oakencroft practice culture of community involvement and builds on a deep-rooted relationship with Little Brook Farm. When Dr. Naile joined the practice 15 years ago, he worked with Cross to create an educational discount program through which practice interns, under supervision of a senior veterinari- an, perform many of the treatments and procedures on the farm's horses. The result has been reduced expenses for the rescue and valuable experience for the interns. \"It's been a great training ground for our interns and a way to mentor this next generation of equine veterinari- ans,\" said Dr. Naile, whose practice has been a longtime participant in the AAEP's Avenues Internship/Externship Program. Imparting tools and opportunities to both law enforce- ment and ambitious new veterinarians will perpetuate Dr. Naile's passion and concern for the well-being of all horses, especially the most vulnerable.

Teigland, AAEP past president and patriarch of South Florida-based racetrack veterinary practice Teigland, Franklin & Brokken DVMs (now TFB Equine), died April 3 in Charlotte, N.C. He was 95. An Iowa native who attended Iowa State University as a ROTC student during World War II and graduated with his veterinary degree in 1945, Dr. Teigland embarked on his equine veterinary career in Miami, Fla. Prior to the introduction of antibiotics and most technology, and equipped with little more than sulfa drugs and medical folklore, Dr. Teigland built a successful, predominately pleasure horse solo practice by using his medical curiosity to figure things out. Following a military commitment from 1950-1953 in which he oversaw the health of the first American primates to be launched successfully into space, Dr. Teigland returned to practice where he contributed to improvements in equine orthopedic surgery and educated others in recognizing, treating and prognosing many equine infectious diseases that emerged in South Florida. Dr. Teigland's openness and willingness to impart his knowledge was unusual among the veterinary community at the time. He eventually hired associates, two of whom\u2014Dr. Benjamin Franklin, Jr. and Dr. Tom Brokken\u2014became partners in the 1970s when the practice evolved into an equal mix of pleasure horse and Thoroughbred race horse care. The practice transitioned exclusively to Thoroughbred care in the 1990s. Although highly accomplished and respected on his own, Dr. Teigland thrived on group practice. He relished con- versations with his fellow veterinarians\u2014even more than chocolate cake\u2014and his partners and associates became better horse doctors because of Dr. Teigland's case analysis, insights and mentorship. Beloved as a natural communicator, Dr. Teigland put colleagues and owners at ease with his knack for storytelling and weaving a joke into a tense situation to lighten the atmosphere. Dr. Teigland was among the earliest members of the AAEP and served as the association's seventh president in 1961. Sixty years later, the practice will be represented by its fourth AAEP president when TFB Equine President and Managing Shareholder Dr. Scott Hay serves in the position, joining Dr. Franklin in 2000 and Dr. Brokken in 2008. In recognition of his contributions to the association, profession and welfare of the horse, the AAEP bestowed on Dr. Teigland Distinguished Life Member status in 1984 and the Distinguished Educator Award in 2001. He also received the 1985 Stange Award for meritorious service in veterinary medicine from the Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine.Dr. M. B.

Creatine kinase activity was measured in the peritoneal fluid and plasma of 10 healthy horses and 61 horses presenting for colic (40 with nonstrangulating lesions and 21 with strangulating lesions). Details of other blood and peritoneal fluid variables, signalment, physical examination results, outcome, requirement for surgery and lesion location and type were retrieved from the medical records. A peritoneal CK cutoff level of 16 IU/L yielded a sensitivity of 95.2% and a speci city of 84.6% (positive predictive value [PPV] =76.9% and negative predictive value [NPV] =97% respectively) for predicting a strangulating lesion. A peritoneal lactate cutoff level of 3.75 mmol/L yielded a sensitivity of 81% and a speci city of 92% (PPV predicting a strangulating lesion. Peritoneal CK concentration was a sensitive indicator of the presence of a strangulating lesion in horses presenting with colic, whereas peritoneal lactate concentration was a more speci c indicator. Measuring CK in peritoneal fluid may be a useful addition to clinical case presentation to accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of horses presenting with strangulating intestinal lesions, thereby improving their outcome. Hypoglycin A in sycamore seedlings This study by Sonia Gonz /C19alez-Medina and colleagues in the UK investigated various pasture management strategies employed to avoid hypoglycin A (HGA) intoxication in horses. Sycamore seedlings from nine locations were either mowed (n =6) or sprayed with a herbicide (dimethylamine- based, n acid-based, n =1). Seedlings were analysed for HGA concentration prior to and at 48 h, 1 and2 weeks after intervention. Cut grass in the vicinity of mowed seedlings was also analysed prior to and 1 week after intervention. Seeds and seedlings maintained for 6 months in processed grass forage (hay and silage) were also analysed. There was no signi cant decline in HGA content in mowed or sprayed seedlings, with mowing inducing a temporary signi cant rise in HGA in the seedlings. HGA was still present in sycamore material after 6 -8 months storage within either hay or silage. These ndings show that neither mowing nor herbicidal spraying reduces HGA concentration in sycamore seedlings up to 2 weeks after intervention. Pastures contaminated with sycamore material should not be used to produce processed hay or silage. Factors associated with equine laminitis In this study, Danica Pollard and colleagues in the UKaimed to identify factors associated with equine laminitis in horses/ponies in Great Britain (GB) using a prospective, web-based cohort study design, with particular interest in evaluating modi able factors identi ed in a previous case- control study.Self-selected horse/pony owners in GB submitted initial baseline and follow-up health and management questionnaires for 1070 horses/ponies over a 29-month period. The enrolled horses/ponies contributed 1068 horse-years at risk with a median of 38 days between questionnaire submissions. Owners reported 123 owner-recognised and/or veterinary- diagnosed episodes of active laminitis using a previously validated laminitis reporting form. Multivariable Cox regression modelling identi ed 16 risk/protective factors associated with laminitis development. In keeping with a previous case- control study, a prior history of laminitis (particularly nonveterinary-diagnosed episodes), soreness after shoeing/ trimming and weight gain were associated with higher rates of laminitis. There is now strong evidence that these risk factors should be used to guide future recommendations in disease prevention. Factors with some prior evidence of association included breed, steroidal anti-in flammatory administration, transport and worming. The modi able factors amongst these should be the focus of future laminitis studies. The remainder of the identi ed factors relating to health, turnout and grazing management and feeding are novel and require further investigation to explore their relationship with laminitis and their applicability as potential interventions. These results serve as a sound evidence base towards the development of strategic recommendations for the horse/ pony-owning population to reduce the rate of laminitis in GB. Ultrasonography to identify manica flexoria tears Lesions of the manica flexoria are a nding in horses with digital flexor tendon sheath tenosynovitis. This retrospective case series study by Rita Martins Garcia da Fonseca and colleagues in Portugal, Belgium and Italy described the ultrasonographic ndings in seven horses admitted for digital flexor tendon sheath swelling associated with lameness and tenoscopic con rmation of a manica flexoria tear. Six horses had a partial manica flexoria tear, one a complete rupture. The ultrasonographic examination included a static examination on the weightbearing and nonweightbearing limb and a dynamic limb assessment during flexion and extension. The main ultrasonographic nding at the static weightbearing examination in horses with a partial tear was an asymmetrical appearance of the manica flexoria at the level of the junction with the lateral border of the super cial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) or an incomplete visualisation of the manica flexoria in the case of complete rupture. The split edges of the complete ruptured manica flexoria were seen floating in the synovial fluid at the examination in flexion. In six of seven cases, the SDFT slid abnormally relative to the deep digital flexor tendon, during flexion/extension movements, with medial displacement of the SDFT, appearance of an anechoic gap between the flexor tendons or reduced SDFT sliding. As ultrasonographic diagnosis of manica flexoria tears is considered challenging, detection of these ultrasonographic features is helpful to increase the likelihood of identifying manica flexoria tears prior to tenoscopy. The authors recommend static ultrasonographic examination of the manica flexoria using a flexed and 10.1111/eve.13079using flexion and extension positioning for horses with suspected digital sheath injury. Musculoskeletal problems in cutting horses This study by Tamara Swor and colleagues in the USAinvestigated musculoskeletal problems associated with lameness and poor performance in cutting horses. Medical records of 200 client-owned cutting horses examined for lameness or poor performance at the Texas A&M University Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital over a 9-year period were reviewed. Data collected included signalment, history, physical and lameness examinationndings, diagnostic procedure results, diagnosis and treatment. Distribution of observed proportions of forelimb and hindlimb involvement was compared with a hypothetical distribution of 50% by means of a v 2test. More horses were examined because of a recent decrease in performance (116/200; 58%) than for lameness (84; 42%). All horses had at least one lame limb, with lameness affecting a total of 281 limbs. Of the 281 lame limbs, 189 (67%) were hindlimbs and 92 (33%) were forelimbs. These proportions were substantially different from a hypothetical distribution of 50% hindlimbs and 50% forelimbs. The most common performance change was that horses would not reverse direction to follow prespeci ed individual cattle and the most common cause of lameness was pain in the sti fle joint region (n =69; 35%). Cutting horses sustained more hindlimb problems than forelimb musculoskeletal problems and although these horses were more likely to be examined for decreased performance than lameness, veterinarians should be vigilant for problems affecting the sti fle joint region. Enro floxacin in pregnancy fluids This study by Robyn Ellerbrock and colleagues in the USA investigated the concentration of enro floxacin and cipro floxacin in pregnancy fluids when administered during late-term pregnancy, in addition to assessing the effect on fetal articular cartilage. Sixteen healthy pregnant mares at 260 days gestation were randomly allocated into one of the three groups: control (no treatment; n =3), enro 11 days. Amniotic and allantoic fluids were sampled on days 1, 5 and 11 and blood samples were obtained every day. On day 11, abortion was induced by manual cervical dilation and the fetuses were euthanaised following delivery. Fetal articular cartilage was examined macroscopically and histologically for lesions. Concentrations of enro floxacin and cipro floxacin in samples were mass spectrometry. Enro floxacin and cipro floxacin reached fetal circulation and accumulated in the pregnancy fluids, reaching the minimum inhibitory concentrations for common pathogens in allfluids. No differences were seen in fetal serum biochemistry values between the control and treatment groups. No lesions were noted on gross inspection of any fetal articular surface and no major abnormal ndings were observed on histological evaluation. These ndings indicate that enro floxacin and cipro floxacin are detectable in the fetusand fetal fluids after administration to late-term mares but do not result in detectable effects on foal cartilage. Comparison of three acute colic pain scales A valid, reliable and usable scale for assessing severity ofacute abdominal pain in horses is needed. In this study Gila Sutton and colleagues in Israel and the UK compared three different scales: (1) the equine acute abdominal pain scale (EAAPS); (2) a scale described by Mair and Smith (2005; M and S); and (3) a numerical rating scale (NRS). Forty brief lms of horses (35 colic cases and ve control horses) were randomly presented to 46 equine veterinariansfrom different countries. Participants were randomly divided into three groups and each used one scale. Five randomly selected lms were shown twice to determine intraobserver reliability. Speed, ease of use and face validity of the scales were evaluated based on expert opinion. The response rate was excellent: 89% for the EAAPS (16/ 18) and 100% for the M and S (18/18) and NRS groups (10/10). The intraclass correlation for indicated signi cantly better interobserver reliability compared to 0.68 for the M and S and 0.71 for the NRS. Moreover, intraobserver reliability of EAAPS (weighted j0.95) was superior to the other scales (weighted j0.78, 0.77, for the M and S and NRS respectively). Other validity measures (convergent, extreme group, predictive validities), usability (time taken to score the lms -speed) and the ease of use of the scales were not signi cantly different. Face validity (endorsement by experts) was better for the M and S scale than for the EAAPS. The EAAPS showed superior reliability, the M and S scale showed better face validity, with comparable usability and other tests of validity. S.

Sport horses in the USA are, without question, some of the best cared for horses in the world. Owners, trainers and riders most often want the very best care possible for their horses regardless of the level of competition, yet lack of education and the desire to win on the part of owners and trainers may blur the line between proper care and abusive practices. Many sport organisations in the USA have somewhat liberal medication rules and even those organised competitions which are strict about treatments (i.e. FEI) may suffer from inadequate stewarding. We, as veterinarians, are ethically obligated to meet the medical needs of the horse and to recommend best practices for their continued health and well-being. When surveyed by this author, most veterinarians caring for sport horses involved in US competitions of eventing, show jumping, dressage, show hunters and western performance readily cited areas of concern regarding equine welfare. It was often expressed that the equine veterinary profession had created some of the problems that now exist. Some were quite defensive in their tone, citing all the good attributes of their sport while blaming any equine welfare concerns on the lack of good horsemanship of owners and trainers. Are owners and trainers solely to blame? The sport horse industry in the USA has evolved into a multi- billion-dollar industry with thousands of competitions each year. Horses have become signi cantly more expensive to acquire and maintain, and there is pressure for these animals to train, compete and win. This is often translated to pressure on the equine practitioner to perform questionable treatments or give advice on practices which may be considered illegal or unethical. The veterinarian is in a unique position to help the horse and minimise abusive practices through educating the client and delivering services which are truly good for the horse but doing so sometimes takes bravery. Colleagues expressed concern for equine welfare related to various aspects of sport horse practice in the USA. There was a consistent concern about overuse of medication in the performance horse. Allied with this were concerns related to medication use with no diagnosis or for the purpose of affecting behaviour. Sport horse practitioners are becoming increasingly aware of the need for better training programmes that condition the horse against injury, yet there is a constant struggle with educating the clients to employ these practices. Often, the treating veterinarian is faced with limited nances which the client prefers to dedicate to the 'quick x'as opposed to extensive diagnostics and rehabilitation. To quote Dr. Kent Allen 'Absent a diagnosis, medicine is poison, surgery is trauma, and alternative therapy is witchcraft '. That said, we may not always be functioning in the best interest of the horse. To promote equine welfare and level the playing eld for competition, the United States Equestrian Federation and the American Quarter Horse Association have promulgated rules regarding medication use and prohibited practices.Medication and treatment rules have been based on 'reasonable therapeutic use 'grounded in the concept that a minor health issue, such as a wound, minor infection or mild soreness, may not be a threat to the welfare of the competing horse when appropriately treated. As a result, a list of medications has evolved that includes some that are not prohibited, and some which are listed as restricted and levels are regulated. There is an extensive list of forbidden medications which include drugs such as psychotropic agents, sedatives, anaesthetics, antihistamines and corticosteroids other than dexamethasone (USEF, 2018). Injectable medications may be administered by thehorseman or veterinarian, but no horse is to be injected with any substance within 12 h of competition by anyone other than a veterinarian (a USEF provision only). A 6-h rule was established by USEF and applies only to fluids, antibiotics and a reduced dose of dexamethasone administered by a veterinarian. Any forbidden medication administered must be for a legitimate therapeutic purpose, withdrawn for 24 h prior to competition, and declared in a medication report. This rule, while arguably liberal, gives the horseman a considerable bit of latitude while addressing realistic health and welfare concerns for the horse in competition. Unfortunately, these rules have allowed for signi cant abuse in the sport horse world governed by these organisations, not to mention unrecognised shows. Trainers are often making the decisions regarding what medications horses in their care receive and advice of what to use often comes from other trainers rather than the veterinarian. There are multiple 'urban myths 'relative to currently allowed and unrestricted medications that may lead to their excessive use in an effort to enhance performance. This is a form of abuse not to mention technically illegal. Often, when veterinarians are asked, they are passive in their advice for fear of alienating the trainer and losing a client. Thus, inappropriate drug use may continue. We have to look at ourselves in the mirror for our past acts of encouraging treatments and joint injections to improve performance. Some of these practices were based on sound medical decisions, some because of client pressure, and some, unfortunately, for our own personal economic gain. Many trainers now expect 'maintenance injections 'simply because nothing has been done to the horse in a while. Such treatments should, from an ethical standpoint, be based on a thorough clinical examination and determined need for such therapy. Surely, some horses that are working hard need periodic therapy for the treatment of in flamed joints or other musculoskeletal issues. Educating the client to do periodic evaluations which may preclude the need for such aggressive therapy is in the best interests of the horse. The veterinarian can be in the driver 's seat by being 'proactive ' and recommending modi cations of shoeing, feeding, general health care (that may include medication) and training practices that may minimise the need for subsequent \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd228 10.1111/eve.12957'reactive 'therapy. Unlike many sports, many of our higher level sport horses have no 'off season 'and perhaps some of these horses simply need a break from training and competition. Most of our clients care deeply about their horses and will graciously receive guidance from their veterinarian. It remains for us to provide good evaluations, appropriate care and give consistent advice that is directed at the welfare of the sport horse and its long-term health.

Trimble* , K. M. Delph, L. A. Beard and E. G. Davis Kansas State University Veterinary Health Center, Manhattan, Kansas, USA. A 7-year-old Quarter Horse mare was presented for severe left hindlimb oedema and nonweightbearing lameness that was progressive over approximately 48 h. The mare subsequently developed marked and worsening oedema, immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA), myositis and myocarditis. degree of pain and severity of myositis were consistent with infarctive purpura haemorrhagica. Fine needle aspiration of affected tissue resulted in positive bacterial culture of Staphylococcus aureus . Purpura haemorrhagica and associated complications are typically associated with Streptococcal sp. infection or exposure, and have not been previously reported in association with Staphylococcus aureus in the horse. The mare responded favourably to long-term, high-dose corticosteroid therapy, antimicrobials and supportive care. Introduction Purpura haemorrhagica is a relatively rare condition of aseptic necrotising vasculitis observed in horses. Clinical signs most commonly reported include: asymmetric, well- demarcated subcutaneous oedema of all four limbs, mucous membrane petechiation, fever, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, reluctance to move and colic (Pusterla et al. 2003; Kaese et al. 2005; (AST) and globulins. In some cases, azotaemia may be present and could be consistent with primary renal injury secondary to pigment- associated nephropathy in severely affected individuals (Pusterla et al. 2003; Kaese et al. 2005). Histopathology of skin biopsy samples from affected individuals is characterised by leukocytoclastic vasculitis with neutrophil in ltration (Pusterla et horses exposed to Streptococcus equi (S. equi ) may suffer from immune-mediated complications such as myositis with progressive muscle al. 2005). Most frequently, purpura haemorrhagica is associated with S. equi exposure or infection Pusterla et al. 2015; Valberg2015; 2016). Notably, in both human and equine patients, purpura has also been associated with other pathogens, medications and vaccines (Michel et al. 1992; Durward-Akhurst and Valberg 2017). Pusterla et al. (2003) reported that among 53 horses diagnosed with purpura haemorrhagica, 17 had con rmed exposure or infection with S. equi, nine suffered from Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis infection, ve had respiratory infection of unknown aetiology, and two had septic wounds, while 15 had no recent history of viral or bacterial infections or exposure to medications. Although uncommon, equine influenza has also been reported to be associated with purpura haemorrhagica in horses (Uppal et al. 1990). Similar to horses, human patients with Henoch- Sch \u20aconlein (purpura haemorrhagica in humans) most commonly develop disease secondary to streptococcal infection, although multiple reports document associations with Staphylococcal sp. infection (Hirayama et al. 1998; Yoh et Eftychiou al. 2008;Audemard-Verger et al. 2015; Maliske et al. 2015). There are no previous reports of equine purpura haemorrhagica developing secondary to Staphylococcus aureus ; however, the current report describes the aforementioned in a Quarter Horse mare with positive bacterial culture and clinical ndings consistent with purpura haemorrhagica. In addition to characteristic clinical signs of oedema and pain of the affected limb, this mare also developed severe IMHA and myocarditis. Case presentation A 7-year-old, 500 kg Quarter Horse mare was presented to the Kansas State University Veterinary Health Center (KSU- VHC) for progressive, proximal left hindlimb swelling of approximately 48 h duration. Septic cellulitis was suspected by the referring veterinarian, and the mare was therefore treated with ceftiofur crystalline free acid (Excede1) once intramuscularly at 6.6 mg/kg bwt and phenylbutazone2orally at a dose of 4 mg/kg bwt twice daily. Historically, the mare was raised by the owner and had no illness, surgery or trauma in the previous year. Deworming with ivermectin and vaccinations that included eastern/ western equine encephalomyelitis, West Nile virus, tetanus, rabies, equine herpesviruses 1 and 4, and equine in fluenza were administered 6 and 8 weeks previously, respectively. The mare was maintained on pasture with other horses that were healthy the morning of presentation. The herd had no \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd230 10.1111/eve.12855previous history of S. equi infection (or any other respiratory disease) or vaccination for S. equi . No recent management changes were made. Diet consisted of brome hay supplemented with concentrate (Equine Strategy PurinaTM). On the day of presentation, the mare was reported to have a reduced appetite. Urination and faecal production were reportedly normal. Shared troughs made water consumption dif cult to assess. With the exception of the phenylbutazone and ceftiofur crystalline free acid, the mare had not received other medications in the previous 60 days. Due to a failure to respond to initial medical therapy, the progressive nature of proximal limb swelling and severe lameness, the mare was referred to the KSU-VHC for further diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management. At presentation, the mare was quiet, alert and responsive. The predomina nt abnormalities involved were marked lameness (4/5 AAEP) and severe swelling of the left hindlimb. Swelling extended from the level of the fetlock proximally to the sti fle, with the most notable area of swelling from the tarsus to just above the sti fle(Fig 1 ). Super cial abrasions were present on the distal aspect of the affected limb near the pastern. Digital pulses were normal. Vital parameters included a mild hyperthermia (rectal temperature 38.6 \u00b0C), a normal heart rate of 42 beats/min, as well as an elevated respiratory rate (32 breaths/min). Body condition was considered good with a score of 5/9. Peripheral lymph nodes palpated normally. Oral mucous membranes were pink and moist with noevidence of petechial or ecchymotic haemorrhages. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Initial diagnostics revealed packed cell volume and total protein to be 27% and 63 g/L, respectively. Ultrasonography of all affected oedematous structures involving the left hindlimb and ventral abdomen con rmed the presence of marked subcuta neous oedema. In most areas, the depth ofoedematous tissues measured approximately 3 cm. The diffuse and marked oedema, which was warm and painful to touch, was most consistent with septic cellulitis. Since there were no open wounds or draining tracks, ne needle aspirate of an affected area over the abaxial aspect of the mid-tibial region was performed. The sample was submitted for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture, as well as antimicrobial sensitivity testing. Based on the problems that included severe lameness, marked oedema, fever, increased respiratory rate, anaemia and mild hypoproteinaemia, the working diagnosis was septic cellulitis. Treatment goals were aimed at resolution of the likely septic component of her disease and control of pain and in flammation. Phenylbut azone 2(2 mg/kg continued for anti-in flammatory and analgesic purposes. Antibiotic therapy included oxytetracycline3(6.6 mg/kg bwt i.v q. 12 h), and was selected based on broad spectrum coverage and favourable tissue penetration. Hydrotherapy was performed on the affected limb for approximately 20 min twice daily. This was followed by the application of topical 60% magnesium sulfate (Mag-60 Paste4) and plastic wrap with a support bandage to complete a sweat wrap that was left in place for approximately 12 h at a time. Hydrotherapy and bandaging were repeated daily for the duration of hospitalisation. Diagnostics and case management Over the subsequent 24 h (Days 1 -2), the mare demonstrated marked deterioration in condition evidenced by profound lethargy, anorexia and marked icterus, as well as worsening of the oedema and lameness. Oedema of the left hindlimb had extended distally to include the fetlock but had also progressed to involve the ventral abdomen from the inguinal region and extended cranially to the axilla ( Fig 2 ). She was also nonweightbearing when standing (grade 5/5) and was reluctant to flex the left hindlimb when ambulating resulting in dragging of the limb. It was suspected that the disease progression was a re flection of the primary disease originating in the left hindlimb and now extending to other adjacent areas. Repeated ultrasonographic evaluation revealed the ventral abdominal plaque of oedema to measure approximately 5 cm in depth in a diffuse manner along the affected ventral region. Additional evidence of clinical deterioration included marked tachycardia (60 -80 beats/min) and development of pigmenturia (haeme positive on urine dipstick). Anaemiaworsened over the initial 24 h post presentation evidenced by a PCV of 13% and total protein of 63 g/L ( Fig 3 ).These ndings suggested intravascular haemolysis, and haematologic evaluation, auto-agglutination of erythrocytes evident. Serum ( Fig 3 ). By Day 2 of hospitalisation, primary differentials included infarctive purpura haemorrhagica, septic cellulitis and snake envenomation for the marked and progressive lameness, severe and asymmetric limb and ventral oedema and elevated muscle enzymes. There was no evidence of a snake bite that could be found on the affected limb. Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia, as well as oxidative damage from toxins such as wild onion or Acer rubrum , were differential diagnoses for the acute and marked anaemia, Fig 1: Signi cant proximal limb oedema from the level of the proximal sti fle to the hock was present in the left hindlimb on presentation. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd231 EQUINE VETERINARY / MAY 2019icterus, pigmenturia and tachycardia. IMHA can result from a primary immune response or be secondary to infectious aetiologies including equine infectious anaemia (EIA) and Clostridium perfringens, pharmacological agents including penicillin, or as a component of paraneoplastic syndrome to accompany neoplasia. Additional differential diagnoses for tachycardia included pain and myocarditis. Based on season (summer), history and clinical presentation including auto- agglutination, toxin ingestion was considered unlikely. Primary management goals were aimed at patient stabilisation and elimination of the inciting pathogen. Serial serum chemistries revealed ongoing muscle damage, with CK values fluctuating between 60,000 and 148,000 U/L ( Fig 3 ). The mare was placed on intravenous lactated Ringer 's solution at a rate of 60 mL/kg bwt/day 12 h after presentation as diuretic therapy for the elevated muscle enzymes and because the mare was not drinking adequately. Although marked pigmenturia was evident, renal injury secondary to myoglobinu ria and/or haemoglobinuria was not apparent based on normal renal values, normal urine speci c gravity (pre-IVFT USG) and urinalysis. In an effort to determine the cause of the marked intravascular haemolysis and auto-agglutination noted on 7%; rr <3%). While this result was not markedly elevated, with the presence of severe anaemia and gross erythrocyte agglutination, an abnormal result was consistent with the presence of surface-associated antibody and supported a diagnosis of IMHA. EIA testing was negative. Based on the severity of anaemia and progressive nature of haemolysis, major and minor cross matches were performed on four KSU College of Veterinary Medicine owned horses 36 h after initial presentatio n (Day 2). Among the horses tested, there was some reaction between patient and all available donor horses for both major and minor cross match testing. These reactions were consistent with the pronounced level of immune activation that the recipient demonstrated clinically. The least reactive cross match was a major 2 +and minor 1 +. Even though there were concerns of a potential transfusion reaction, the mare was in critical condition and the need for increased tissue oxygen delivery was considered urgent. In addition, the mare received 0.2 mg/kg dose of dexamethasone2(2 mg/mL) to ameliorate ongoing and potential worsening immune-mediated erythrocyte destruction and vasculitis, and 8 L of whole blood was administered approximately 40 h after presentation. The mare did not demonstrate evidence of acute or delayed transfusion reactions. Following whole blood transfusi on, PCV rose and stayed above 18% for the remainder of hospitalisation. Due to persistent tachycardia (60 -80 beats/min) and development of an irregular cardiac rhythm on Day 3 of hospitalisation, an ECG was performed which revealed ventricular premature complexes. Echocardiographic examination was unremarkable. Cardiac troponin I levels were signi cantly elevated at 41.83 ng/mL (rr 0 -0.7), supporting the diagnosis of myocarditis. Based on the fact that the most common aetiologic agent associated with purpura haemorrhagica is S. equi , diagnostics were aimed at determining if this pathogen was playing a role in disease manifestation. Streptococcus equi subspecies equi M protein (SeM) ELISA titre, upper airway endoscopy, rectal palpation, thoracic and abdominal ultrasound were performed on Day 4. Streptococcus equi subspecies equi M protein titre was negative ( <1:200). Upper airway endoscopy was within normal limits, ruling out chondroids or guttural pouch empyema associated with Fig 2: Forty-eight hours after initial presentation, the mare developed pitting ventral oedema, extending approximately 5 cm below the abdominal wall, and was noted from the inguinal region to the axilla. 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 0123456789D C B APCV Creatine kinase (U/l)PCV (%) CK Day hospitalisation10020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000140,000160,000 Fig 3: Graph depicting trends of creatine kinase and packed cell volume during hospitalisation.

Palpation per rectum and thoracic and abdominal ultrasound examinations were within normal limits making metastatic S. equi abscess formation unlikely. All of these ndings ruled S. equi out as the primary pathogen involved in this case. Culture and sensitivity results of a ne needle aspirate sample obtained at presentation, available on Day 5, revealed a heavy growth of Staphylococcus aureus . Antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated sensitivity to several antimicrobial agents that included tetracycline. Since the mare was receiving oxytetracycline3at therapeutic dosages, antibiotic therapy was not changed. Additional therapeutics In this case, S. aureus cellulitis was implicated in the manifestation of suspect infarctive purpura haemorrhagica causing mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 12 h for 2 days (beginning Day 2), then tapered to 0.1 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 12 h for 2 days, then 0.1 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h for 3 days. When clinical improvement was noted and the mare appeared to stabilise, the dose was reduced to 0.1 mg/kg bwt q. 24 h intramuscularly. Cryotherapy was implemented on Day 3 for the prophylactic management of potential laminitis, as elevated digital pulses in the forelimbs were noted while the mare received the highest dose of dexamethasone. As the dexamethasone dose was reduced, cryotherapy was subsequently discontinued on Day 6. Digital pulses returned to normal, and shifting limb lameness was not present. The mare was continued on phenylbutazone2as needed for pain associated with her cellulitis and primary disorder, oxytetracycline3for septic cellulitis and prevention of secondary infection, vitamin E (Elevate/C226W.S.)5for anti-oxidative properties (20 IU/kg bwt per os q. 24 h), and omeprazole6(4 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h) for treatment of gastric ulceration. Gastric ulcer risk was considered extremely high due to anorexia, stress and concurrent administration of corticosteroids and NSAIDs. The mare demonstrated a favourable response to 10 days of hospitalised care, at which time the owner elected to take her home for further management. At the time of hospital discharge, ventral and limb oedema was markedly improved, PCV was stable at 25%, heart rate was consistently between 50 -60 beats/min, and CK had decreased to 24,000 U/L. The mare was maintained on a 3-week tapering course of dexamethasone4(initially 0.5 mg/kg (20 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h). Follow-up telephone communication approximately 6 weeks following hospital discharge con rmed that the oedema was completely resolved, but the mare appeared stiff at the walk. Dexamethasone had been discontinued, and the mare was bright and eating well, however further veterinary examination and blood work had not been performed at that time. The referring veterinarian moved to another practice, and the patient was subsequently lost to follow-up. Discussion Purpura haemorrhagica, a type III hypersensitivity reaction, isan aseptic necrotising vasculitis that results from immune in vascular walls (Galen and Timoney 1985; Valberg 2015). Although it is most commonlyassociated with Streptococcal sp. infection, the reported case demonstrates that purpura haemorrhagica may develop as a sequela to 1993; Pusterla et al. 2015; IMTP and myopathies (Pusterla et al. 2003; Kaese et al. 2005). Medical therapy, regardless of inciting cause, is centred around dampening the immune and in flammatory responses and eliminating the inciting cause. Infarctive purpura haemorrhagica is a more severe form of purpura by necrotising leukocytoclastic vasculitis in addition to subsequent infarction in numerous tissues such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, skin, gastrointestinal tract and lungs (Kaese et al. 2005; Valberg 2015; Durward-Akhurst and Valberg 2017). Clinically, horses may demonstrate muscle swelling, abdominal pain, tachycardia and sloughed necrotic skin. Blood work may reveal neutrophilia with a left shift, hypoalbuminaemia and markedly elevated serum activity (Kaese et al. 2005; Durward-Akhurst and Valberg 2017). Prognosis in these patients tends to be guarded. In a case series by Kaese et al. (2005), among ve horses diagnosed with infarctive purpura haemorrhagica, only one horse survived. All horses in this series had evidence of infarctions within the skeletal muscle, andhad a history of S. equi infection. Furthermore, there seemed to be a breed predilection, speci cally the Quarter Horse. While denitive diagnosis is established by skin and/or muscle biopsy and histopathology, the authors of the current report felt that performing a biopsy in this mare was contraindicated in the acute stages of disease based on the deterioration of condition, degree of pain, severity of oedema and marked anaemia. While considered later in the course of disease, skin or muscle biopsy testing was not performed based on concern for impaired wound healing and potential secondary sepsis due to the degree of therapeutic immune suppression required to stabilise her myositis and myocarditis. When combined with her apparent favourable response to therapy, invasive diagnostics were not considered imperative for the successful management of this patient. Based on clinical signs of severe limb and ventral oedema, severe lameness and serum chemistry abnormalities that included marked increases of CK and AST, a presumptive diagnosis of infarctive purpura haemorrhagica was made. The mare in the current report had no history or clinical signs of a Streptococcal exposure or infection. Henoch- Sch\u20aconlein purpura, which occurs in human patients, is an immune complex disease sharing resemblance to purpura haemorrhagica observed in horses and is typically associated with Streptococcal disease (Mills et al. IgA immune complexes and high serum concentrations of C3d that are deposited within the blood vessels, creating a type III hypersensitivity reaction and vasculitis (Eftychiou et al. 2006). The most common form is seen in children, however there is a more severe adult manifestation. Clinical signs include a rash on the legs and buttocks, arthritis of the knees and ankles(75%), nephritis (40%) and gastrointestinal tract in flammation and The predominant difference between \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd233 EQUINE / AE correlate conditions is that Henoch- Sch\u20aconlein purpura is not associated with an infarctive disease involving skeletal muscles (Blanco et al. 1997; Pillebout et al. 2002). In both species, the importance of early and aggressive corticosteroid treatment cannot be emphasised enough. In previous reports of infarctive purpura haemorrhagica, such as Kaese et al. (2005), survivors were treated with high doses of corticosteroids for a prolonged period of time. This report credited the survival of these patients to largely result from high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Therefore, this mare initially received 0.2 mg/kg bwt of intravenous dexamethasone every 12 h, and was maintained on this extremely aggressive dose for 3 days. Declining serum creatine kinase concentration was used to monitor therapeutic response ( Fig 3 ). On the day drug dose was decreased to 0.1 mg/kg bwt intravenously twice daily, CK had been stable for 3 days and clinical improvement was noted. The day the dose was decreased, CK once again increased to above 100,000 U/L. However, digital pulses were palpable and the authors elected to not increase the dose of dexamethasone again. The following day, the CK fell below 100,000 U/L, and continued to trend downwards for the remainder of hospitalisation, which was factored in to the tapering regime of the dexamethasone dosing schedule. The positive culture of Staphylococcus aureus in the reported case was unexpected. However, there have been multiple reports of Henoch-Sch \u20aconlein being associated with S. aureus in people (Hirayama et al. 1998; Yoh et al. 2012; Audemard-Verger et al. 2015; Maliske et al. 2015). It is speculated that in the mare of the current report, staphylococcal superantigens caused massive T-lymphocyte cell stimulation and subsequent cytokine release resulting in tissue damage, similar to what happens in human patients suffering from staphylococcal infections. Superantigens link speci c variable regions of the T-cell receptor bchain (V b) with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, resulting in marked 1b), IL-2, IgA and IgG results in immune complex formation and a type III hypersensitivity reaction with subsequent aseptic, 1992; Yoh et al. 2000; Eftychiou et al. 2006). Typically, S. aureus infections do not cause IMHA. In the mare described in this report, diagnostic testing con rmed the presence of erythrocyte surface-associated IgG molecules above reference ranges. Therefore, it is hypothesised that staphylococcal antigens, potentially superantigens, triggered marked immune-mediated disease manifestation, which contributed to erythrocyte destruction in this case. Due to the rapid and intravascular nature of erythrocyte destruction marked immune system stimulationlikely resulted in the presence of erythrocyte complement-mediated Ig molecules contributed to cell removal by process of Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis by splenic macrophages (Wilkerson et al. 2000). Although the mare was clinically improved at the time of hospital discharge, she was not normal and remainedtachycardic. Ideally, repeat cardiac troponin I levels, repeat PCV and echocardiography should have been performed tobetter gauge long-term prognosis; however, these additional diagnostics were declined by the owner. Because of the signi cant insult to her myocardium as evidenced by elevated troponin I levels and associated arrhythmia, she is at a higher risk for cardiac arrhythmias and potentially sudden cardiac death. Therefore, future riding was not recommended for this patient. In conclusion, purpura haemorrhagica and concurrent immune-mediated disease manifestations including IMHA and myopathies typically carry a poor to grave prognosis. Most reports, in both people and horses, link the development of purpura with a previous or concurrent streptococcal infection; however, there has been increasing evidence that staphylococcal infections may also be associated with this condition. While the mare in the current report may not return to previous level of performance, early and aggressive medical management with antimicrobials and corticosteroids provided a more favourable outcome than what has previously been reported.

Tripathi ICAR- National pearl millet Summary This report of mycotoxicosis in horses describes the clinical signs, post-mortem ndings, histopathological ndings and prognosis following the accidental feeding of mycotoxin contaminated fodder to the horses at a farm over a 3-year period. Variable clinical signs viz. weight loss, height retardation in foals, episodes of sudden weakness and staggering gait, ulceration in the oral cavity and at mucocutaneous junctions, yawning, decreased appetite to complete anorexia, rectal prolapse, and failure of blood clotting were observed in many horses at an organised equine farm over a period of 2 -3 years. Post-mortem examination of these cases revealed liver cirrhosis and pathological changes in other organs too. On examination of the fodder, it was observed that pearl millet fodder fed to the animals had ergot infestation. On laboratory investigation of the fodder, a flatoxins levels ranged from 24 ppb to 70 ppb in pearl millet fodder. The analysis eventually led to discontinuation of the pearl millet fodder. On follow-up for 2 years, no new cases of hepatic cirrhosis were seen. Most of the horses at the farm including those that had shown high levels of serum gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and weight loss, recovered completely. The present episode demonstrates that there is a need for regular monitoring of cereal fodders of horses in subtropical and tropical areas to avoid mycotoxicosis. In the present episode,monitoring serum/plasma GGT levels was found to be a sensitive biochemical indicator to identify liver damage caused by mycotoxins. Introduction Fungal infestation of fodder plants and consequent occurrence of mycotoxicosis in domesticated animals has been widely reported. However, reports of naturally occurring cases of mycotoxicosis in horses are scarce. The present episode of mycotoxicosis in horses was observed to be associated with pearl millet ( Pennisetum glaucum ) fodder, which is widely used for horses in northwestern India (Pal et al. 2013) and is prone to mycotoxin contamination in the eld (Cereser et al. 2004). Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium are common mycotoxigenic fungi detected in pearl millet (Wilson et al. 2006). Clinicopathological manifestations in experimental mycotoxicosis in horses include inappetence, depression, fever, tremor, ataxia, liver with and brown urine (Caloni and Cortinovis 2011). The present report describes a natural episode of mycotoxicosis in an organised equine farm due to exposure to mycotoxins from fodder over a period of 3 years.Case history At an organised farm of approximately 150 equines (approximately 100 horses and 50 donkeys and mules), 20 horses had died after exhibiting various clinical signs in 3 years. Prior to death, these horses exhibited dullness, depression, yawning, skin lesions ( Fig 1a and c), ulcers in the oral cavity (Fig 1b ), tachycardia, behavioural immunosuppression, body weight loss and inappetence to complete anorexia. Of the 20affected horses, two died suddenly without showing any clinical signs. Histopathological examination of the necropsy samples revealed cirrhosis of the liver in all horses. These horses were being stall-fed with pearl millet as green and dry fodder, with sewan grass ( Lasiurus scindicus ) serving as dry fodder at the time of the last mortality; both fodders were completely weed-free. Oats, sorghum and lucerne were other green fodders being used seasonally. Concentrate feed included a mixture of oats, wheat bran and gram. After the initial deaths of four horses in the rst year and similar histopathological ndings of cirrhosis in all cases, feed and fodder were tested for the presence of a flatoxins. A flatoxins levels in the feed and fodder were determined to be within permissible limits of <30 ppb; therefore, the feed and fodder remained unchanged. However, six more horses died in the second year, and ten horses died in the third year. Clinical ndings There was loss of body weight in all the horses at the farm and growth of young animals was retarded. Frequencies of different clinical manifestations in all 20 dead horses are given in Table 1 . Diagnosis In the present case report, histopathological ndings and clinical signs revealed evidence of chronic liver cirrhosis. Causes of chronic liver disease in adult (Popenga 2009). Fodder provided to the horses in the present episode was weed-free; therefore, there was no evidence of alkaloid or plant toxicity. Serum triglyceride levels ( Table 2 ) were too low to indicate hepatic lipidosis (Mogg and Palmer 1995). Serum total iron binding and serum transferrin saturation levels ( Table 2 ) in the horses were not compatible with iron toxicity. Icterus is the primary sign in suppurative cholangitis and cholelithiasis, and it was not seen in most of the cases in \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd236 present episode. post-mortem systemic granulomatous disease, suppurative cholangitis, amyloidosis, neoplasia or cholelithiasis were not found. Investigation of the feeding history of the last 3 -4 years revealed that the feeding of pearl millet as dry and green fodder to the horses had increased steadily. Clinical cases of liver cirrhosis began to appear after 1 year of inclusion of pearl millet fodder in signi cant amounts. All the adult horses at the farm were losing body weight, and growth of younger horses was retarded. These phenomena led to suspicion of the presence of mycotoxins in the feed/fodder again; therefore, fodder crops of pearl millet and sorghum in the eld were screened once more. It was found that 2 -5% of the flowers of pearl millet were infested with black-coloured fungus and ergot. Pearl millet was being fed to horses after chaf ng the complete plant along with the seeds and fruits. To estimate the level of mycotoxins in the pearl millet fodder, plants were randomly selected from six areas of two square metres each, dried in an oven, powdered and sent to the laboratory in sealed polythene packs. Samples of other feed and fodder, such as concentrate feed, sewan grass straw and sorghum were collected and sent to Animal Feed Analytical and Quality Assurance Laboratory, Veterinary College and Research Institute, Namakkal, Tamil Nadu, India, to estimate mycotoxin levels. Levels of a flatoxin-B1 in six samples were 12 ppb, 50 ppb, 25 ppb, 12 ppb, 12 ppb, 12 ppb and those of a flatoxin-B2 were 12 ppb, 20 ppb, 20 ppb, nil, nil, nil, respectively ( Table 4 ). Out of six samples of pearl millet, four samples exhibited a flatoxins above the FDA- a) b)c) d) Fig 1: a) Skin lesions around the nares. b) Oral mucosal ulcers. c) Skin lesions in the inguinal region. d) Rectal prolapse.

A flatoxin levels in two samples were excessively high; one sample contained 70 ppb a flatoxins (50 B1+20 B2) while the other contained 45 ppb (25 B1 +20 B2). Laboratory con rmation of a flatoxins led to the immediate discontinuation of pearl millet fodder from the diet.Blood biochemistry Serum biochemical analyses ( Table 2 ) for the clinically sick horses exhibited abnormally high levels of gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) (mean range 48 to 575 (U/L)). Simultaneously, serum GGT levels of 66 randomly selected accompanying horses ( Table 3 ) were also higher than theTABLE 2: Biochemical pro le of the horses that died in the mycotoxicosis episode Parameters Mean /C6SE (Range)Normal range (Gupta et al. 2002) Parameters Mean /C6SE (Range)Normal range (Gupta et al. 2002) Gamma -glutamyl n =11164/C640 2 TABLE 3: Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels from a random sample of horses at the time of last case seen and 2 years later All stock random at the time of identi cation of high mycotoxins in pearl millet fodder Mean /C6SE (Range) n =66All stock random after 2 years of discontinuation of pearl millet fodder Mean /C6SE (Range) n =53, (Excluding seven animals showing clinical signs of chronic liver disorder)Horses with chronic liver disorder after 2 years without pearl millet fodder Mean /C6SE (Range) n -169) TABLE 4: Levels of mycotoxins in the feed and fodder Name of mycotoxinConcentrate feedFodder (Pearl millet) 1Fodder (Pearl millet) 2Fodder (Pearl millet) (Pearl millet) 5,6Sewan hay ppb nil 12 ppb nil nil Aflatoxin-G1 nil nil nil nil nil nil nil Aflatoxin-G2 nil nil nil nil nil nil nil Ochratoxin nil nil nil nil nil nil nil T-2 Toxin nil nil nil nil nil nil nil Citrinin nil nil nil nil nil nil nil Zearalenone nil nil nil nil nil nil nil Tests for mycotoxins and water were conducted by the Animal Feed Analytical and Quality Assurance Laboratory, Veterinary College and Research Institute, Namakkal - 637 002, Tamil Nadu, India, on payment basis. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd238 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY Table 2 ). Serum protein levels (mean 75.4 g/L) were slightly higher than the normal reference range and there was a low albumin/globulin ratio. Serum total bilirubin (mean 42.08 lmol/L) and conjugated bilirubin were higher than the normal ranges, but not high enough to show clinical signs of jaundice. However, a slight yellowish discolouration of body tissues was present in some cases. Serum levels of triglycerides (mean 1.51 mmol/L) were above than the normal range for horses. Serum cholesterol, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, phosphorus, iron, iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation levels were in the normal ranges. On follow-up 2 years after discontinuation of the pearl millet fodder, the mean serum GGT levels of 53 randomly selected clinically healthy horses on the farm averaged approximately 20 (U/L) (range, 5 -51 (U/L)) ( Table 3 ). However, serum GGT levels of the seven horses showing signs of chronic liver damage (CLD) were persistently high even after 2 years without pearl millet fodder (mean =98 (U/L), range 50 -169 (U/L)). Treatment The duration of the whole episode was long, and many animals were affected; therefore, all possible efforts (e.g. i.v. dextrose, antibiotics, NSAIDS, liver extracts, vitamin B complex, herbal liver tonics and low protein diets) to treat the horses were undertaken. There was no improvement in any animal, except several horses that were showing neurological signs exhibited a temporary improvement of those signs after i.v. dextrose therapy. After discontinuation of the pearl milletfodder, all the horses at the farm were treated with oral herbal liver tonics (Liv 52 of Himalaya Pvt. Ltd. at 50 mL daily for an adult horse) and jaggery at 250 g daily for an adult horse and were fed oats only as concentra te for 6 months. Outcome After discontinuation of pearl millet fodder, no new cases appeared at the farm, and most of the affected animals began to gain body weight. However, seven horses persistently showed signs of chronic liver damage and high serum GGT levels even after 2 years. Post-mortem ndings Gross lesions A large amount of unclotted blood ( Fig 2b ) was ( Fig 2a ) with rmness was common in all cases. Microscopic lesions Liver cirrhosis was consistently observed. Hepatic architecture was completely lost and was instead characterised by massive mature connective tissue proliferation in the portal triads, extending to the liver parenchy ma and leading to the formation of pseudo globules. Islands of hepatocytes could be seen in the proliferating brous tissue ( Fig 3a and b). Discussion Claviceps invasion of the flowering heads of grasses produces ergot alkaloids.

The clinical manifestations of ergot poisoning in mares are early embryonic mortality, abortions, dystocia, and thickened or retained placental membranes (Fayrer-Hosken et al. 2008). Dystocia and retained placenta in three mares on the farm in question pointed towards ergot intoxication. In the present episode, clinical cases began to appear after 1 year of feeding with pearl millet fodder in large amounts. Horses new to the farm with exposure of less than 1 year did not show clinical signs and their serum GGT levels remained in the normal reference range. Observations made during the present episode are in agreement with those of Adams et al. (1993) that mycotoxins accumulate over a long time and that animals exposed to low levels of mycotoxins do not die or show clinical signs in the early phase. Likewise, in experimental studies, ponies exposed to a flatoxins for a short period of time did not develop pathognomonic signs (Asquith et al. 1980; Aller et al. 1981). In domestic animals, mycotoxin contamination reduces growth (CAST 2003), which matches the growth retardation observed in the young horses in the present episode. The liver is the primary target site for mycotoxin and aflatoxin intoxication (Greene and Oehme 1976; Angsubhakorn et al. 1981; Vesonder et al. 1991). Upon necropsy examination, the consistency of the liver was rm, with marked centrilobular hepatic necrosis, along with the massive proliferation of broblasts observed on histopathological examination in all cases. The level of aflatoxins required to induce clinical signs in horses varies. Greene and Oehme (1976) observed that a flatoxin levels of 58.4 ppb induced severe hepatic cirrhosis, weight loss, jaundice and mortality, while Angsubhakorn et al. (1981) have reported that peanut meal containing 200 ppb a flatoxins caused fatty liver, haemorrhagic enteritis and mortality. Vesonder et al. (1991) reported that corn containing 130 ppb of a flatoxins induced hepatic necrosis in three horses. Hasso (2003) reported that 12.5 ppb of a flatoxin B1 in barley bran was sufcient to induce diarrhoea in Arabian horses. In the present episode, the a flatoxin level in sewan hay and concentrate feed mixture was 24 ppb. Both were continued even after discontinuation of pearl millet. This showed that a flatoxin levels in fodder up to 24 ppb without ergot were acceptable to the horses. However, a flatoxin levels 24 ppb or above were found to be deleterious to the horses when it had the simultaneous infestation with ergot. Thus, the signs observed in the present episode might be due to a cumulative effect of ergot and aflatoxins. However, the mycotoxin levels in the fodder were measured at a late stage of the episode, so the actual concentrations of a flatoxins ingested by the horses earlier might differ from the measured values. In the present episode, blood clotting was affected badly in all of the horses on the farm, so much so that it was dif cult to obtain serum from the collected blood samples. Red blood cells automatically settled down without coagulation and plasma was separable without adding any anticoagulant. In human subjects, Lichen planus is a mucosal reaction to chronic liver cirrhosis (Del Olmo et al. 2000); similarly, in most of the horses in the present episode, nonhealing ulcerative lesions were present in the oral cavity, the inner side of lips, and over the mucocutaneous junctions of the lips. A mild yellowish discolouration of the eyes, mucousmembranes and vaginal mucous membranes were present in eight cases, although plasma levels of total bilirubin were notexcessively high. The peak level of serum bilirubin was 89.62 lmol/L in one case, with the major part of the bilirubin existing in unconjugated form. In horses, levels of unconjugated bilirubin can rise to six times the normal level during fasting (Gronwall and Mia 1972). The measurement of serum concentrations of GGT is a sensitive screening test for subclinical liver disease in horses (Curran et al. 1996). In the present case study, GGT was the most useful biochemical parameter to note effect of a flatoxins on horses. Levels of serum GGT in the horses that died of liver cirrhosis were up to 575 (U/L). Other horses at the farm that showed only weight loss and reduced appetite as clinical signs also had high serum GGT levels. On discontinuation of pearl millet from the fodder, serum GGT levels of most of the horses returned to normal reference levels, indicating that hepatic microsomal enzymes were no longer being induced. In the present episode, haemochromatosis was observed in liver cells. Hepatic cirrhosis along with haemochromatosis has been reported in horses (Pearson et al. 1994). Serum iron levels in the present episode were within normal limits for horses (Borges et al. 2007; Yoruk et al. 2007). The saturation state of iron binding capacity ranged from 48 to 64%, and there was no source of high iron in the horse fodder. Thus, the haemochromatosis in the liver in the present episode might have occurred secondary to cirrhosis (Pearson et al. 1994). Therefore, the clinical, biochemical, necropsy and histopathological ndings led us to conclude that the disease outbreak likely occurred due to the cumulative effect of ergot and a flatoxins. Conclusions In areas where pearl millet is used as fodder for horses, pearl millet should not be fed to the horses after the flowering stage because pearl millet at this stage is at risk of ergot and other mycotoxin infestation. Liver cirrhosis and related clinical signs of mycotoxicosis develop after feeding the mycotoxin-infested crop (A flatoxin levels 24 -70 ppb) for at least 1 -2 years. Old animals suffer rst and most seriously. After the appearance of clinical signs in horses with liver cirrhosis, the horses cannot be cured until or unless the primary cause is removed. GGT is the most important biomarker for subclinical or clinical injury of the liver due to mycotoxins. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Clinically, reduced mobility of the neck and a prominent atlas were identi ed. Neurological evaluation revealed hypermetria, circumduction and reduced proprioception, predominantly in the hindlimbs. and conrmed on post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging and pathological examination. Both the atlas and axis were hypoplastic and dysplastic, and a fusion of the atlanto- occipital joint was found. A dynamic compression of the spinal cord was present at the rst and second cervical vertebrae. Histologically, the spinal cord was degenerated due to compression. Furthermore, there were muscular malformations including a brotic obliquus capitis cranialis muscle, aplasia of parts of the rectus capitis muscles and presence of additional abnormal muscle. Such muscular abnormalities associated with OAAM have not been reported yet and this is the rst report of a case of OAAM in a Warmblood horse. Introduction Congenital occipitoatlantoaxial malformations (OAAM) are seldom diagnosed in domestic animals (Mayhew et al. 1978a). Cases have been reported in cattle (Leipold et al. 1972; White et al. 1978; Watson et al. 1985), sheep (Cravero et al. 1976; Van Nie and Folkerts 1977; Schmidt et al. 1993), dogs (Watson 1979; Read et al. 1987; Galban et al. 2010) and cats (Jaggy et al. 1991), but the vast majority of cases have been described in horses (Schmaltz 1915; Leipold et al. 1974; Mayhew et al. 1978a; Watson et al. 1985; Wilson et al. 1985; Watson and Mayhew 1986; deLahunta et al. 1989; Gonda et al. 2001). Anatomical abnormalities associated with OAAM can be found in the occiput, atlas (C1) and axis (C2). The most commonly encountered malformations include abnormalities of the occipital condyles, fusion of occiput and C1, incorrect localisation Jaggy et al. 1991; Schmidt et al. 1993; Rush 2012). Clinical signs are variable, ranging from mild ataxia to tetraplegia and may become more severe with increasing patient age (Mayhew et al. 1978a). The Arabian horse is the most common breed affected by OAAM. In this breed, OAAM is inherited in an autosomalrecessive manner without a sex predilection (Noden and deLahunta 1985; Watson and Mayhew 1986). Isolated cases have been reported in Appaloosas, Quarter Horses, Morgan Horses and Standardbreds (Mayhew et al. 1978a; Wilson et al. 1985). Although Warmblood horses represent one of the most widespread breed, the authors are unaware of any literature describing OAAM in Warmbloods. The purpose of this case report is to describe a case of congenital OAAM in a Warmblood horse. Case details History A 3-year-old Swiss Warmblood mare was referred to the Equine Hospital, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Switzerland with a 3-month history of ataxia. The horse had been bred by the current owner who reported a normal development until the mare was due to be broken and trained. At this time, the owner noted an atypical swaying of the hindlimbs with an increased range of motion of the pelvis whilst trotting. The owner suspected a luxation of the hip to be the origin of the problem. No history of trauma was reported, although this cannot be excluded completely as the mare had been kept on pasture together with other horses. At the age of 1.5 years, the horse had been presented to a veterinarian for a fetlock laceration and no neurological de cits had been noted on that occasion. Clinical examination At presentation, the mare was in excellent body condition. Rectal temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate were within normal ranges. The head was carried in an extended position ( Fig 1 ) and a prominent C1-C2 area was visible. Palpation of the neck revealed bilateral painful protrusions at the C1-C2 region. Active neck flexibility was moderately reduced to both sides. The mare showed a generalised ataxia at the walk and trot that was graded as 2 out of 5 (Mayhew et al. 1978b) in the forelimbs (moderate dysmetria, hypermetria and proprioceptive de cits) and 3 out of in the hindlimbs (severe dysmetria, hypermetria and proprioceptive decits, moderate toe dragging and circumduction). Walking the horse with its chin lifted exacerbated the ataxia and whilst backing a tendency to buckle was observed in the hindlimbs. There was no evidence of cranial nerve de imaging Radiography Lateral and ventrodorsal views of the cervical spine were obtained ( Fig 2 ) using a computed radiography system1. The dorsal arch of C1 in the dorsoventral dimension was moderately shortened. Furthermore, the most dorsal aspect of C1 was positioned considerably more ventral than the spinous process of C2. Both lateral vertebral foramina were not identi ed on radiographs. The dens of C2 was shortened and blunted. The cranial part of the spinous process of C2 was also shortened and blunted. The ventral part of the atlanto-occipital joint was not fully developed and the joint space was superimposed with mineral opaque material suggestive of partial fusion of the joint.Myelography and cerebrospinal fluid analysis A myelogram was performed under general anaesthesia in right lateral recumbency. A spinal needle (20 gauge, 89 mm length) was placed between C1 and C2 and inserted into the subarach noid space to collect 60 mL of cerebrospinal fluid with subsequent injection of 60 mL of a nonionic iodinated contrast agent (Iohexol, 350 mg/mL)2. Radiographs were taken in neutral, extended and flexed cervical position. The limited distribution of contrast agent cranially to the injection site and the superimposition with the malformed bones did not allow adequate assessment of the myelographic column in the region between the occiput and the axis, however a subjective narrowing of the dorsal and ventral contrast columns were noted between C1 and C2 suggestive of extradural compression of the spinal cord. The distribution of the contrast agent caudally from the injection site was good, and no abnormalities were detected caudad to C2. Cerebrospi nal fluid analysis was performed but did not reveal abnormalities in cell count and cytology. Computed tomography myelography Computed tomography (CT)3myelography was performed and revealed an irregular longitudinal split of the entire length of the dorsal arch of C1 ( Fig 3 ). Both wings of C1 had an irregular shape and were smaller than usual. These alterations were more pronounced on the right side. The right cranial articular fovea of C1 was enlarged and sclerotic - associated with a corresponding bony extension of the right occipital condyle. A moderate mineralised bridging of the right part of the atlanto-axial joint was identi ed. The dens of C2 was shortened and showed a heterogeneous reduced bone density. Between the dens of C2 and the occiput, an irregular linear mineral attenuatin g structure was detected. This was interpreted as within the apical ligament of the dens, which runs in the vertebral canal between dens of C2 and occiput ( Fig 4 ). At the level of the atlanto-occipital joint, a reduction of about 60% of the myelographic column Fig 1: Right-lateral photograph of the head-neck region. The head is carried in an extended position. Note the prominent wingof C1 (arrow) and the prominent tendon of insertion of the M. longissimus atlantis (star). Fig 2: Lateral radiograph of the cranial neck. The dorsal arch of C1 is shortened.

However, the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord was comparable in size to the adjacent cord. The ventral contrast column at the level of C2 disappeared while the neck was in flexion and a slight compression of the spinal cord was detectable at this location ( Fig 5 ). In flexed position, the dens of C2 was clearly ed displaced dorsally due to hypoplasia and malformation ( Fig 5 ). The mare underwent euthanasia after the CT examination was completed due to the poor prognosis. Post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging Post-mortem, the mare 's neck was sectioned between the 7th cervical and the 1st thoracic vertebra and a magneticresonance imaging examination was performed using a 3T magnet (Philips Ingenia 3T)4. CT were con rmed. The altered apical ligament of the dens was easily recognisable. Spinal cord compression at the level of the dens of C2 was also identi ed. There was no evidence of any brosis or gliosis of the nervous tissue that would indicate chronic tissue damage. Necropsy ndings and anatomic preparation Both rectus capitis ventralis and lateralis muscles were missing bilaterally. Instead of them, a thin and long muscle extendingfrom the cranial aspect of the transverse process of C2 to the muscular tubercle of the occipital bone was identi ed. This abnormal muscle was only visible after dissection and retraction of the longus capitis muscle ( Fig 6 ). Furthermore, the cranial oblique muscle of the head had an abnorma lrm consistency on palpation. The atlas showed the most severe abnormalities. The cross-sectional shape of this bone was rectangular instead of squarish. As previously observed by CT and magnetic resonance imaging, a longitudinal split with a width of 4 - 9 mm was present along the entire dorsal arch of C1 ( Fig 7 ). Both wings of C1 were smaller and thicker than normal, and both had an incisura alaris instead of a foramen alare (Fig 7 ). The cross-sectional area of the spinal canal was substantially smaller at the level of C1 than at the level of the occiput and C2. Finally, the ventral tubercle of the dorsal arch of C1 (black arrows), the irregular shape of the dens of C2 (grey arrow), the shortened spinous process of C2 (black star) and the mineral attenuating focus in the region of theapical ligament of the dens of C2 (white arrow).

A dorsal displacement of C2 due to hypoplasia and malformation of the dens M. rectus capitis ventralis and lateralis muscles are missing bilaterally. Note the bilateral thin and long muscle (stars) extending from the cranial aspect of the transverse process of C2 to the muscular tubercle of the occiput. This abnormal muscle was only visible afterdissection and the longus MAY nuchal crest of the caudal part of the asymmetric. The foramen magnum an asymmetric ovally proliferations ( Fig 8 C1 of C2 was abnormally short and had an irregular surface and contained several cavities ( Fig 9 ). The axis showed a slight curvature to the right, whereas the C3 was distinctly curved to the left. The C4 showed a curvature in the same direction as C2. This curvilinear shape of C1 to C4 resulted in a scoliosis of the cranial cervical spine. Histology Small samples of spinal cord and synovialis of the atlanto-axial joint were collected and sections (2 -3lm) were mounted on glass slides and stained with haematoxy lin-eosin using standard procedures. Histological examination of the spinal cord revealed swelling of the myelin sheaths with fewmyelinophages located within the sheaths. Rarely, the axons were completely missing (mild Wallerian axonal degeneration) mainly affecting the ventral funiculus. The grey matter was without pathological ndings. The cranial oblique muscle of the head was sclerotic, i.e. exhibited thick collagenous bundles and fatty tissue between sparse muscle bres ( Fig 10 ). hyperplastic tissue was slightly in ltrated by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Thus, a mild chronic proliferative inflammation of the atlanto-axial joint was present. Fig 7: Dorsal view of C1.

Key ndings were hypoplasia and dysplasia of C1 and C2, partial fusion of atlanto-occipital rectus capitis ventralis and rectus capitis lateralis muscles, presence of an abnormal muscle extending from C2 to the occiput, sclerosis of the cranial oblique muscle of the head, scoliosis of the cranial cervical spine and local dynamic ventral compressive damage to the spinal cord leading to the clinical sign of a grade 3/5 spinal ataxia. Furthermore, in a flexed position a dorsal subluxation of the dens of C2 was detected. Most horses affected by OAAM develop ataxia due to compressive damage to the spinal cord secondary to the bony malformations early in life. In many cases, ataxia has been observed while they are foals (Mayhew et al. 1978a; Gonda et al. 2001). In some cases, ataxia develops progressively to the age of 2 -3 years (Wilson et al. 1985) as in the horse described in this case report. A few horses described in the literature had only mild proprioceptive decits or did not show signs of ataxia up to age 5 years (Watson and Mayhew 1986). Affected horses are usually subjected to euthanasia as they cannot be used for riding. The ataxia can be progressive and is a risk for the patient and rider and in Arabians, the heritable nature of the condition is to be considered. Furthermore, there is no promising therapeutic option (Green 1995; Hahn 2006). Surgical intervention has been suggested in breeds other than Arabians to correct the atlantoaxial subluxation and scoliosis associated with OAAM (Rush 2012) but there is neither a description of such a procedure nor a report of a case treated with such an approach. Apart from radiographic information, there are some descriptions of post- mortem examinations but little information using other diagnostic modalities (Mayhew et al. 1978a; Wilson et al. 1985; Watson and Mayhew 1986; Gonda et al. 2001). This present report characterises OAAM in a Warmblood horse using multiple diagnostic imaging modalities and post- mortem examination. This allowed for very accurate illustration of the anatomical abnormalities including malformation of the adjacent musculature that has hitherto not been described in a case of OAAM. Using information obtained by clinical, radiological and morphological studies, classi cation of OAAM into four types was suggested. These were de ned as type A; atlanto-occipital fusion with hypoplasia and malformation of C2 caudally at C2: and type occipital condyles and cervical scoliosis(Mayhew et al. 1978a). An additional type D characterised by duplication of C1 was documented in a young Arabian horse (Watson et al. 1985). It is dif cult to assign the patient described in this report to one of the types A -D mentioned above. The lack of a duplication of C1 rules out a type D form of OAAM. Similar to a type C variation, the mare had partial atlanto-occipital fusion and vertebral scoliosis. Aplasia of the occipital condyles was however, not present. Similarly, the mare had many features assigned to type B, i.e. atlanto-occipital fusion and cervical scoliosis, but the bone fragment at C2 typicalfor a type B abnormality was not found. Most abnormalities described in our case ful l the criteria of a type A abnormality which is the typical hereditary form observed in Arabian horses. Wilson et al. (1985) described two cases of OAAM in two mature non-Arabian horses (one Appaloosa and one Quarter Horse) that showed signi cant similarities with the mare presented in this case report. In all these horses, the head was carried in an extended position. The neurological signs (ataxia and proprioceptive de cits) did not appear in either of these horses before the age of 2 or 3 years, respectively. All three horses suffered from severe anatomical variations of the occiput, C1 and C2, with the most signi cant nding being the mineralised fusion between C1 and occiput. Additionally, the Quarter Horse described by Wilson et al. (1985) showed a ssure like longitudinal defect along the entire dorsal arch of C1 as described in our case report. Gonda et al. (2001) described another case of OAAM in a 7-day-old Quarter Horse colt. Radiographic examination of this colt revealed deformation and shortening of the transverse processes and the dens of C2, thus inducing a subluxation of the dens ventral to C1. Post euthanasia, a severe compression of the spinal cord at the level of C1-C2 was detected, which explained the pronounced clinical signs. Similar to this colt, the Swiss Warmblood mare of this case report showed pathological variation in the dens of C2 with a subsequent subluxation of C2 toward dorsally. OAAM is most commonly diagnosed in Arabian foals, but this and other case reports (Wilson et al. 1985; Gonda et al. 2001) show that it should be on the list of differential diagnoses for foals and young horses of other breeds showing signs of cervical spinal ataxia. Furthermore, this case report provides evidence that the malformations associated with OAAM are not restricted to the bones but can also involve the musculature.

Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium diphosphonic acid - um salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sen - sitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some minerals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, immediately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyper - kalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in hors - es less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lactating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the total dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormal - ities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing. Other signs reported were lip licking, yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling, and hives/pruritus. Distributed by: Dechra Veterinary Products 866-933-2472 \u00a9 Dechra Ltd.

Gilsenan* Rood and Riddle gilsenanw@gmail.com Keywords: horse Occipitoatlantoaxial malformation (OAAM) is uncommon cause of spinal ataxia in horses. This congenital disease is primarily considered to be one of Arabian horses. This breed pattern has led to the strong suspicion that the disease is at least in part hereditary in nature. Pedigree analyses (Mayhew et al. 1978; Watson and Mayhew 1986) suggest that the malformation is passed on in an autosomal recessive manner. To date, four types of OAAM have been described and there are no accounts of muscular anomalies relating to this malformation. There are a handful of reports of this malformation in other equine breeds (Wilson et al. 1985; Gonda et al. 2001), but an extensive body of scienti c literature studying this disease does not presently exist. Br\u20acunisholz et al. (2019) present an important account of documenting this lesion in a Warmblood mare. In this case report, the clinicians 'thorough and pragmatic approach to diagnostics led to an unexpected but accurate diagnosis. These diagnostics included a complete and objective physical examination and the incorporation of multiple diagnostic imaging modalities. Proper clinical evaluation led to the antemortem diagnosis of a progressive, untreatable and possibly heritable disease. The clinicians 'ndings allowed appropriate management of the horse with respect to the horse 's quality of life and to the owner 's safety, time and nances. The horse described in the report by Br \u20acunisholz et al. (2019) was presented by the owner for a suspected hip luxation. This conclusion precipitated from the observation of 'atypical swaying of the hindlimbs with an increased range of motion of the pelvis while trotting '. Differentiating between musculoskeletal disease and neurological disease is among the greatest challenges that confront a clinician evaluating a horse with gait abnormalities. The examination of the musculoskeletal system and neurological system need to occur in conjunction with one another. As explained by Furr and Reed (2015), horses with musculoskeletal disease can appear to exhibit neurological de cits; the reason for this is that a normal neurological examination is predicated upon the presence of a sound musculoskeletal system. If multiple musculoskeletal lesions are present, affected horses may very well stumble or pivot when asked to perform complicated manoeuvres. The key to discerning disease of these two systems is that horses with lameness will have predictable gait decits; these horses have an intact proprioceptive system. They will consistently alter their gait in a manner that minimises pain. Horses with spinal ataxia will have gait de cits that are reliably unpredictable ( 'irregularly irregular '). There is little rhyme or reason to the manner in which they place their feet when asked to circle, backup, or come to a stop. Bentz (2009) provides an algorithm to approach differentiating these two disease categories. The algorithm reinforces that a complete neurological examination (including mentation,cranial nerve re flexes, and segmental re flexes) is helpful to include, as additional neurological de cits might be identi ed elsewhere. The preceding case report also highlights well the potential for congenital diseases to remain occult or to go unnoticed for several years. Congenital abnormalities of the central nervous system are uncommon in horses (Furr 2015). One post-mortem study evaluated 543 horses with neurological disease and identi ed congenital malformations in only 2.4% of these cases (Laugier et al. 2009). Congenital lesions are, by de nition, present from birth. Congenital lesions are not necessarily hereditary in nature but might also precipitate from toxic, metabolic, infectious or other causes. Itis dif cult to identify a single inciting cause in most cases. It might be that congenital malformations result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While congenital abnormalities of the neurological system are uncommon, they are typically apparent at birth or shortly thereafter. Most accounts of OAAM describe the disease in affected foals. The mare in the preceding case report was believed to have been neurologically normal. Thorough physical examination of this mare indicated palpable and visible abnormalities as well as decreased range of motion of the mare 's neck. These ndings prompted suspicion of a cervical vertebral anomaly and directed the diagnostic work- up towards imaging of the neck. Not unlike horses affected by cervical vertebral stenotic myelopathy (CVSM), the delayed onset of neurological de cits in this mare might be attributable to progressive narrowing or deforming of the spinal canal as the mare matured and as ossi cation occurred. The authors observed that the severity of this horse 's ataxia varied with neck position; the onset of neurological decits appeared to coincide with breaking and training the horse. Presumably, the introduction of exercise and increased neck motion dynamically exacerbated pre-existing narrowing of the bony spinal canal. To the author 's knowledge, this is the rst report that includes computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging ndings from a horse affected with OAAM. Antemortem CT examination illustrated irregularities in the occiput and affected cervical vertebrae. Cross-sectional imaging also facilitated depiction of dorsolateral myelographic compression of the cervical spinal cord at the atlanto-occipital joint. The utility of computed tomography to identify circumferential spinal cord compression in horses affected with CVSM has been investigated (Moore et al. 1992). The advantage of these modalities is that the spinal cord can be assessed for compression that occurs beyond a simple dorsal - ventral plane. Our comprehension of CT and MRI anatomy of the equine cervical spine is still evolving, but as standing advanced imaging machines and larger bore magnets become more readily available, these diagnostic imaging \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd248 10.1111/eve.12820modalities will likely of OAAM and other cervical vertebral pathologies (Sleutjens et al. 2014). While muscular anomalies were only identi ed post-mortem, advanced imaging will play an important role in determining the role of the neck musculature in future cases of OAAM. Conclusions The preceding case report is an extremely helpful addition tothe body of scienti c literature available on OAAM. This is an unusual presentation of OAAM with respect to both breed and age. The malformations described in this mare do not t neatly into the four types of OAAM that are presently described. Previous reports of this disease have not described anomalies in the neck musculature either. Many congenital equine diseases seem to follow familial patterns. However, these problems have the potential to affect horses of any breed. In this case, it is possible that the genes responsible for OAAM in Arabians have dispersed into the gene pool of other breeds. The diversity of known OAAM con gurations might exist because of the presence or interaction of multiple genes or even the in fluence of environmental factors. The case presented by Br \u20acunisholz et al. (2019) expands our understanding of this disease and will serve as a useful reference for future accounts of OAAM. The incorporation of advanced imaging into this case 's diagnostic work-up interestingly demonstrated the malformation and its effect on the spinal cord antemortem and, as such, aided in the decision-making process of case management. Advanced diagnostic imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, should be used whenever possible if OAAM is suspected. This case report is also a helpful reminder of the value of completing a thorough and objective evaluation. As stated already, this case is an example of an unusual presentation of an uncommon disease. This horse presented for suspected musculoskeletal disease; by approaching the horse 's problems logically and systematically, the clinicians achieved a tricky, but accurate, diagnosis.

Tennent-Brown U-Vet Equine Centre, The University mare was presented for investigation of haematuria of 2 weeks 'duration. On cystoscopy, multiple small pedunculated soft tissue structures were observed on the bladder mucosa. Histopathological analysis of the masses was consistent with chronic polypoid cystitis. The polypoid lesions and associated haematuria resolved following prolonged antibiotic treatment. Polypoid cystitis has not previously been described in horses. This condition should be considered a differential for haematuria, requiring cystoscopy and biopsy to con rm a diagnosis. Introduction Haematuria can arise from haemorrhage anywhere along the urinary tract. Commonly recognised causes of haematuria in horses include urethral defects (Schumacher et al. 1995), uroliths (Lund et al. 2013), various forms of neoplasia (Fischer et al. 1985; Voeroes et al. 1993; Hurcombe et al. 2008) and infections (pyelonephritis and cystitis) (Kisthardt et al. 1999; Saulez et al. 2005). Less commonly, haematuria has been associated with exercise (Schott et al. 1995), idiopathic renal haemorrhage (Schott 2009; Gracia-Calvo et al. 2014), ingestion (Schoeb and Panciera 1978; Schmitz 1989), gentamicin toxic nephropathy (Riviere et al. 1982) and long-term or excessive nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug administration (Aleman et al. 2011). The term 'polypoid cystitis 'is used to describe a condition of the urinary bladder featuring reversible, outward-growing (polyp-like) in flammatory lesions (Kilic /C223et al. 2002). The condition is a rare cause of gross haematuria in human patients that is often mistaken as an indicator of neoplastic bladder disease (Lane and Epstein 2008). urothelium et 1983). Oedema of the submucosa, in ltration with lymphocytes and granulocytes, increased vascularity and evidence of haemorrhage are also described. In man, polypoid cystitis commonly occurs as a result of bladder mucosal injury secondary to urolithiasis (Martinez et al. 2003) or urethral catheterisation (Ekelund et al. 1983), but in some cases an underlying aetiology is not identi ed (Kilic /C223et al. 2002). For human patients, the reasons for presentation are usually related to bladder obstruction or haematuria (Kilic /C223 et al. 2002; Lane and Epstein 2008). Polypoid cystitis has been documented in dogs, for which the most common reason for presentation is gross haematuria, with abnormal urination behaviour also common (Moses et al. 2002; Martinez et al. 2003; Eo Jin et al. 2009). The condition has also been reported in domestic cattle associated with bracken ferntoxicosis (Carvalho et al. 2006). Polypoid cystitis has not been documented in horses and this report describes haematuria related to the condition in an otherwise healthy pony. Case details Case history A 15-year-old Australian Riding Pony mare presented to theUniversity of Melbourne 's Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) with a history of discoloured (red-tinged) urine present throughout urination. The discoloured urine was rst noticed by the owners 2 weeks previously and was not associated with exercise. The owners reported neither signs of abdominal discomfort nor signs of dysuria, stranguria or pollakiuria. The mare did not have access to known noxious plants, including bracken fern. On initial evaluation by the referring veterinarian, the pony appeared to be in good health with a normal heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature. Following sedation with detomidine (Dormosedan 1;0 . i.v.), a speculum examination of the vagina and cervix was performed and was considered normal. A urine sample collected at the same visit had a speci c gravity of 1.015, with dipstick evaluation revealing a pH of 8.0 and moderate proteinuria. On sediment examination, >200 erythrocytes/high powered eld were observed although the white cell count of the sample was normal ( <5/high powered eld) and there was no evidence of casts or crystals. Culture of the urine sample was not performed based on the absence of pyuria. Haematology and plasma biochemistry pro les collected at the time of this initial evaluation were normal. Based on these ndings, the pony was referred to the VTH for further evaluation. Clinical ndings On presentation to the VTH, the mare was bright and alert and in good condition (BCS 6 out of 9) (Henneke et al. 1983). Resting heart (44 beats/min) and respiratory (14 breaths/min) rates were normal with no abnormalities appreciated on thoracic auscultation. Rectal temperature was 37.7 \u00b0C. Oral mucous membranes were pink with a capillary re ll time of <2 s. No evidence of mucosal haemorrhage suggestive of primary haemostatic dysfunction was present. Hydration, based on skin turgor, jugular re ll and mucous membrane character, was considered adequate. The pony showed no signs of abdominal discomfort or evidence of urinary incontinence or stranguria during evaluation at the VTH. Vaginoscopy was unremarkable and the external os of the cervix was closed with no discharge evident. Cystoscopy revealed grossly red-tinged urine that was \u00a92017 doi: 10.1111/eve.12807evacuated using gentle suction. There was no evidence of sabulous material accumulation within the bladder. The majority of the bladder mucosa appeared grossly normal; however, there were multiple small, polypoid structures projecting from the mucosa throughout the bladder ( Fig 1 ). Haemorrhage from the mucosal attachment of several of these lesions was evident. Several pinch biopsies were collected from lesions and the adjacent (grossly normal) bladder mucosa and submitted for histopathology. Urine expelled from both ureters appeared grossly normal. Following cystoscopy, palpation of the bladder per rectum was performed with no abnormalities appreciated. Transrectal ultrasonography revealed focal thickening of the bladder wall and focal irregularities of the bladder mucosa. Transcutaneous ultrasonography of the kidneys was considered normal. Histopathology results Histological examination of the pinch biopsy samples identi ed intracellular swelling and cystic vacuolation of epithelial cells and there was accumulation of mildly degenerate neutrophils forming microabscesses ( Fig diffuse of epithelium was intact brinosuppurative exudation. There were moderate numbers of Gram-positive cocci located within brinosuppurative exudate in one (the largest) sample but this was not observed in others. Histopathology of the apparently normal mucosa revealed mildly oedematous epithelium with minimal evidence of in flammation. No evidence of atypical cells or mitotic gures to suggest a neoplastic process was present in any of the sections examined. Based on the histological ndings, a diagnosis of chronic polypoid cystitis was made. Differential diagnoses Neoplasia of the urinary tract was considered most likely at the time of initial evaluation at the VTH, although the appearance of the bladder mucosa was not consistent with previously described bladder neoplasms. Squamous cell carcinoma (Fischer et al. 1985; Serena et al. 2009), transitional cell carcinoma (Lisowski et al. 2015), lymphosarcoma (Sweeney et al. 1991; Meyer et al. 2006) and leiomyosarcoma (Hurcombe et al. 2008) have been reported as causes of haematuria in horses, although they are typically associated with dif culty urinating and/or systemic illness which was not evident in this patient. Other differentials included benign bromatous/ broepithelial polyps (Fischer et al. 1985), urothelial papilloma or polypoid formation secondary to cystitis, although the latter two have not been previously described in horses (Tsuzuki and Epstein 2005). Pyelonephritis as a cause of the haematuria was considered unlikely given the pony 'sg o o d health and the absence of signs of a systemic illness on physical examination, haematological analysis and urinalysis.

The signi cance of the bacteria observed histologically was unclear; however, based on the clinical course (see below), it was assumed that a bacterial infection was at least a component of the aetiology. The mare was discharged from hospital the same day of examination. Repeat cystoscopy was scheduled for 2 weeks 'time, with a view to perform urine culture if there was no evidence of clinical improvement following empirical antibiotic treatment. Outcome and follow-up Two weeks after the initial presentation, communication viaa telephone conversation with the owners indicated that the haematuria had resolved and that the mare remained otherwise healthy. Cystoscopy was postponed and treatment with the potentiated sulfonamide continued. Repeat cystoscopy was performed approximately 3 weeks after presentation to the VTH to monitor the response to treatment. Subjectively, the appearance of the urine was much improved although there had been little or no change in the appearance of the mucosal polypoid lesions. Urine collected from both ureters was grossly normal in appearance; white cell counts estimated from a haemocytometer were 11 leucocytes/ lL from the left ureter and 10 leucocytes/ lL from the right. Both samples also had increased red cell counts (19,800 -29,621 erythrocytes/ lL); this was thought to be a result of trauma associated with sample collection or perhaps vesicoureteral re flux. Renal haemorrhage was considered unlikely based on the overallclinical picture but could not be completely excluded. No bacteria or neoplastic cells were identi ed in either sample. Due to the clinical improvement, urine culture was not performed and antibiotic treatment was continued for a further 2 weeks. One week after discontinuing antibiotics (6 weeks after initial evaluation), cystoscopy revealed grossly normal urine and both ureters were observed to expel urine that was grossly normal. There was a marked reduction in the number and size of the polypoid lesions with only a few areas of slightly raised, irregular bladder mucosa and no evidence of haemorrhage. Biopsies were not collected nor were further urinalyses performed due to the clinical improvement. No further treatment was prescribed and the owner was advised to revisit in 4 -6 weeks 'time unless the haematuria re- occurred. Prior to the nal cystoscopy and 8 weeks after discontinuing antibiotic therapy, the owners had not observed the pony to urinate. Red-tinged urine was found upon bladder catheterisation and two small, slightly raised areas of mucosa were present on cystoscopy. Another larger, more pedunculated mass was also noted. Urine expelled from both ureters appeared grossly normal. Histopathological evaluation of a pinch biopsy collected from the larger mass con rmed polypoid cystitis. Given the clinical improvement previously achieved with potentiated sulfonamide treatment, a 4-week course of trimethoprim -sulfadimidine (30 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h) was re-instigated. Telephone follow-up with the owners one and 5 months after discontinuing medication revealed that the pony 's haematuria had resolved.Discussion Polypoid cystitis is a non-neoplastic condition affecting the bladder mucosa that is associated with gross haematuria in humans and dogs but, as far as the authors are aware, has not previously been reported in horses. A bromatous polyp characterised by brous tissue covered by transitional epithelium has been described in one horse (Fischer et al. 1985). However, that case lacked the histological signs of inflammation of the lesions observed in this case, and did not display the hyperplastic transitional epithelium with associated in flammation and oedema. In this case, a diagnosis of polypoid cystitis was made in an otherwise healthy middle-aged pony based on histological ndings. Although surgical removal of polypoid lesions is the recommended treatment in human patients, resolution of haematuria and a marked regression of the lesions were achieved in this case with prolonged, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Polypoid cystitis is suggested to arise from chronic irritation of the bladder mucosa. In human patients the condition is most commonly associated with an indwelling urinary catheter, although the condition has been reported in the absence of urinary catheterisation (Young 1988; Kilic /C223et al. 2002). In dogs, polypoid cystitis has been associated with bacterial urinary tract infections and uroliths (Martinez et al. 2003). However, a denitive aetiology has not yet been determined for dogs and it is unclear whether the associated bacterial infection is a cause or a consequence of the polypoid lesions. In the medical literature, the terms polypoid and papillary cystitis have historically been used interchangeably. However, while the two conditions represent a continuum and both are characterised by in flammation and proliferation of the bladder mucosal epithelium, polypoid and papillary cystitis can be distinguished grossly and on their histological appearance. Grossly, polypoid lesions appear as oedematous, broad-based outgrowths of the epithelium while papillary lesions appear as thin frond-like projections (Young 2009). Polypoid cystitis is frequently confused with urinary tract neoplasia based on both gross inspection at cystoscopy and, in some cases, histology. A human study reported that 26% (41/155) of cases of polypoid cystitis were initially incorrectly as papillary urothelial neoplasms (Young 1988; Lane and Epstein 2008). The prevalence of haematuria in human patients with polypoid cystitis has not been reported, but 82% of canine cases reportedly present with gross haematuria (Martinez et al. 2003). Simultaneous regression of the polypoid lesions and resolution of the gross haematuria in combination with the overall clinical picture suggests that, in this mare, haematuria resulted from bladder mucosal bleeding. However, it can often be dif cult to de nitively exclude other sources of haemorrhage. Cystitis is uncommon in horses and not typically associated with obvious haematuria, although this might depend on the underlying cause and severity of disease. The signi cance of the proteinuria detected on initial dipstick urine analysis is questionable in this case, as there were no other indicators of renal disease and quanti cation was not performed. Alkalotic urine or increased haemoglobin concentrations will both result in a positive protein reaction on dipstick analysis; the latter being the most likely explanation in the current case (Wilson 2007). Urinalysis was not consistent with an ascending bacterial infection of the \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd252 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2019bladder and predisposing factors (e.g. urolithiasis or neurological bladder dysfunction) for cystitis were not identi ed in this case. Further, no signs of abnormal urination or systemic illness were reported to suggest a pre-existing cystitis that could have led to formation of the polypoid lesions. The clinical improvement following antibiotic treatment provides circumstantial evidence of bacterial involvement; urinary culture might have helped to delineate that relationship but, unfortunately, was not performed in this case. Interestingly, numerous bacterial species have been cultured from dogs with polypoid cystitis perhaps suggesting that opportunistic bacteria are harboured within the polypoid tissue rather than causing the lesions (Martinez et al. 2003). In addition to urine culture, culture of biopsy samples is recommended as urine culture is often negative even when bacteria are present (Kilic /C223et al. 2002; Martinez et al. 2003). Where relevant, the removal of potential irritants is advocated for the resolution of polypoid cystitis. Removal of permanent indwelling urinary catheters resulted in disappearance of the polypoid lesions in one human case series (Ekelund et al. 1983). If this fails, surgical excision or partial cystectomy is recommended and is considered the more effective treatment strategy for polypoid cystitis in man and dogs (Kilic /C223et al. 2002; Martinez et al. 2003). Antibiotics such as amoxicillin, enro floxacin and potentiated sulfonamides have been used with initial resolution of clinical signs in dogs, but cessation of treatment was generally followed by recurrence of haematuria (Martinez et al. 2003). The decision to use a potentiated sulfonamide in this case was based on the availability of an oral formulation to facilitate long-term administration by the horse 's owners, its broad spectrum of activity and the ability to reach high concentrations in the urinary tract (Van Duijkeren et al. 1994). As with many clinical cases, nancial constraints limited some aspects of the investigation of this case. As mentioned, culture of urine and biopsy samples might have helped determine the role of bacteria in this condition and allowed more targeted antimicrobial therapy. The high erythrocyte count and leucocytes present in the ureteral samples was considered most likely to be due to trauma during sample collection or secondary to vesicoureteral re flux rather than of renal origin, but this could not be con rmed with concurrent or follow-up analysis from ureteral and bladder urinary samples. Additionally, inconsistency in the way that erythrocyte counts were reported prevented useful comparison between urine samples collected from different sites (ureter vs. bladder) and at different time-points. This last point highlights the importance of consistent testing methodology, particularly in chronic cases. A nal cystoscopy to con rm complete resolution of the polypoid formation would have been ideal, but was not performed. The aetiology of polypoid cystitis in man and domestic animals appears complex and remains poorly understood. Whilst the condition is commonly associated with irritation or trauma to the bladder mucosa, this is not always the case. Further, the role of bacteria in polypoid cystitis remains to be elucidated. Surgical removal is currently advocated for treatment of polypoid cystitis in dogs and man because, although initially responsive, the condition tends to recur with even very prolonged courses of antibiotics. However, in the equine case described here, remission or resolution of thecondition appeared to be associated with the prolonged administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting thatsome cases of polypoid cystitis might not require surgical intervention.

The site, if not the cause, of haemorrhage can sometimes be revealed by examining that portion of the urinary tract palpable per rectum, by endoscopically examining the urethra and bladder, or by ultrasonographically examining the kidneys. When cystolithiasis or urethrolithiasis is determined to be the cause of haematuria, further examination is indicated to identify disease of one or both kidneys that might have precipitated formation of the urolith. Contrast-en hanced, cross-sectional imaging of the abdomen of small equids might be of value when a vascular anomaly of a kidney is suspected. Neoplastic cells can sometimes be found in the urine of horses suffering from neoplasia of the bladder or in peritoneal fluid of horses suffering from renal neoplasia. When a kidney is determined to be the source of haemorrhage, urine can beobtained for bacterial culture and cytological examination by passing tubing through the biopsy port of an endoscope into the ureter draining the kidney in question. Histological examination of tissue obtained by biopsy of the kidney or the mucosa of the bladder may be indicated when neoplasia of one of these organs is suspected. Immunohistochemical examination of endoscopically obtained tissue from a cystic carcinoma can identify whether the neoplastic cells express COX-2 receptors, thereby determi ning if treating the horse with a COX-2 selective NSAID might be effective. There are not many reported causes of haematuria in horses, but with the report by Rosales et al. (2019) in this issue of Equine Veterinary Education describing a horse with haematuria caused by polyps in the bladder, the list becomes a bit longer. With a good history and physical, endoscopic and ultrasonographic examinations, the cause, or at least the site, of haematuria can usually be readily determined. History and signalment may provide clues indicating the site of haemorrhage. For example, horses that urinate immediately before strenuous exercise may develop haematuria because of mucosal erosions that develop in the bladder 'sm u c o s aa sa result of abdominal viscera pounding the bladder against the pelvis (Schott et al. 1995). Haematuria of two horses was reportedly caused by damage in flicted during exercise to that portion of a full and heavy bladder directly overlying a pubic exostosis or osteochondroma (Rebsamen et al. 2012). Haematuria caused by a cystolith may be evident only afterthe horse exercises and is often evident only near the end of urination. So, when haematuria is reported to occur after exercise, the clinician should consider a cystolith, osteochondroma of the os pubis or exercise-induced haematuria as a possible cause. When a gelding develops haematuria evident only at the very end of urination (i.e. terminal haematuria), the cause is most likely a urethral rent ( Fig 1 ) or cutaneous habronemiasis of the urethral process (Brinsko et al. 2011). Haematuria caused by a urethral rent occurs when contractions of the bulbospo ngiosis muscle, which normally force urine from the urethra at the end of urination, force blood from the corpus spongiosum penis (CSP), which surrounds the urethra, through the rent into the lumen of the urethra. In addition, the drop in pressure in urethral lumen at the end of urination also causes blood to flow from the CSP, through the rent (Taintor et al. 2004). Horses with cutaneous habronemiasis develop haematuria if a lesion erodes the mucosa of the urethral process, because the CSP extends into the urethral process. The authors and another (Schott 2003) have observed that owners of horses with idiopathic renal haematuria, a syndrome occurring most often in Arabian horses, often report nding clotted blood on the stall floor. Passing clots of blood, however, is also reported to be a feature of horses with a tumour in the bladder (Cornelisse 2003). Knowing that a horse with haematu ria has been administered a Fig 1: An endoscopic view of the bladder of a horse with haemorrhagic cystitis is shown. Picture courtesy of Dr. (NSAID) term is a clue that the cause of haemorrhage may be NSAID-induced ulcers in the urinary bladder (Aleman et al. 2011) or that the haemorrhage is caused by NSAID-induced necrosis of the renal medullary crest (Read 1983; Behm and Berg 1987). Haematuria may be the primary presenting sign of a horse with cantharidin toxicosis (i.e. blister beetle toxicosis) (Schumacher 2007), although horses with haematuria caused by cantharidin toxicosis usually display signs of abdominal pain or endotoxaemia by the time they have developed haemorrhagic cystitis. Palpating the bladder per rectum may provide a clue or ad e nitive answer as to the cause of haematuria. A cystolith can usually be palpated per rectum, especially if the bladder contains little urine, and the probability of palpating a cystolith is enhanced when the hand is inserted no further than wrist deep, to the level of the neck of the bladder, where a cystolith is most likely to lodge (Duesterdieck-Zellmer 2007). Normally, the ureters cannot be palpated per rectum, but a ureter enlarged by the presence of an ureterolith might be detected. A cystic neoplasm may be mistaken for a cystolith during palpation of the bladder, but a cystic neoplasm feels less rm than a cystolith (Traub-Dargatz 1998). In a retrospective study of horses diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma, a large, smooth or irregular kidney or an intra- abdominal mass, not recognised at the time as being a neoplastic kidney, was found during examination of the abdomen per rectum in the majority of affected horses (Wise et al. 2009). Detecting a prominent exostosis on the pubic bone during transrectal palpation of the abdomen of a horse with a history of exercise-induced haematuria might indicate that haematuria is the result of repetitive damage to the bladder by the protuberance (Rebsamen et al. 2012). The site from which the haemorrhage emanates can usually be identi ed during endoscopic examination of the lower portion of the urinary tract. A 100 cm long (or longer), 12 mm diameter (or preferably smaller) endoscope is used to cystoscopically examine a male horse. The horse can be induced to protrude its penis by administering a tranquiliser or a sedative or by anaesthetising its pudendal nerves, at the level of the ischium, or the penis can be manually extracted from the preputial cavity, provided that the horse is amendable to this manipulation. The cavernosal spaces of the CSP, which surrounds the urethra, become prominent when air is introduced into the urethra of a male horse, as the endoscope is advanced proximally (Schott and Varner 1997). The prominent cavernosal spaces may be mistaken for in flamed mucosa, or even haemorrhage, leading to an inappropriate diagnosis of primary urethritis. The occurrence of primary urethritis, however, is not well-documented in the horse ( Table 1 ). A longitudinal rent, or tear, on the convex surface of the urethra can sometimes be found at the level of the ischium during urethroscopic examination of a gelding with haematuria (Fig 1 ) (Schumacher 2007; Madron et al . 2013). The site of the rent can be readily con rmed during urethroscopy by pressing on the urethra percutaneously, with a nger, at level of the ischium. A urethral rent should be suspected as the cause of haematuria of a gelding even when no rent is observed during urethroscopy, if the results of examination have eliminated all other possible sites of haemorrhage (Glass et al. 2016). Urolithiasis, primary cystitis ( Fig 2 ) (Smith et al. 2016), mucosal ulceration associated with chronic administration of a NSAID(Aleman et al. 2011), exercise-induced mucosal erosions in the 2002), al. 2008; 2009; Busechian et al. 2016) and polypoid cystitis (Rosales et al. 2019) can be identi ed during cystoscopy. Immuno- histochemical examination of endoscopically obtained tissue from a cystic carcinoma can identify whether the neoplastic cells express COX-2 receptors, thereby determining if treating the horse with a COX-2 selective NSAID might be effective (Lisowski et al. 2015; Busechian et al. 2016). The slit-like ureteral ori ces can be found during cystoscopy at the 10 and 2 o 'clock positions in the trigone region of the bladder, about 2 cm from the urethral opening. They can be dif cult to locate but can be found by watching for spurts of urine discharging asynchronously from the ori ces, about once every minute from each ori ce (Schott et al. 1990; Carr 2003). The kidney or ureter can be identi ed as the source of haemorrhage when discharge from a ureteral ori ce is bloody. Bloody urine for cytological examination and bacterial culture can be aspirated through sterile polyethylene tubing advanced from the biopsy port of a sterilised endoscope through the ureteral opening ( Fig 3 ). Ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys should be considered if lesions of the upper portion of the urinary tract are thought to be the likely cause of haematuria, based on history, results of palpation of the kidneys performed per rectum or endoscopically observing blood emanating from a ureter. The kidneys are typically examined ultrasonographicallytranscutaneously using a real-time B-mode ultrasound scanner with a 3- to 5-MHz curvilinear transducer. Increased echogenicity of the renal papilla and echogenic debris within the renal pelvis found during ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys support a diagnosis of renal medullary necrosis, typically caused by long-term administration of a NSAID, as a cause of haematuria (Reef 1998). A hyperechoic structure that causes distal acoustic shadowing within the renal pelvis, seen during ultrasonographic examination, can be presumed to be a renal calculus (Juzwiak et al. 1988). Ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys for a nephrolith or other disease of the upper portion of the urinary tract is warranted when a urolith is found in the bladder or urethra (Mair and Holt 1994; Schott 2002). In one study, one or more nephroliths were found in four of 68 horses that had a urolith in the bladder or urethra (Laverty et al. 1992). In another study, ve equids with recurrent urolithiasis of the bladder or urethra were found to have nephrolithiasis or pyelonephritis, indicating that a cystolith or urethrolith may, for some horses, be the consequence of renal disease (Schott 2002). A hypoechoic-to- anechoic focal mass caused by Halicephalobus gingivalis larvae was found in the renal medulla during ultrasonographic examination of a kidney of a donkey (Schmitz and Chaf n 2004). Renal biopsy may be indicated when a renal mass is found during ultrasonographic examination or during palpation of the abdomen per rectum of a horse with haematuria. Horses with pyelonephritis have ultrasonographic renal changes that include decreased length, increased echogenicity, abnormal outline of the kidney, loss of corti- comedullary distinction, pyelectasia and focal hypoechoic or hyperechoic cortical defects (Kisthardt et al. 1999). These same ultrasonographic changes may also be seen in horses with idiopathic renal haematuria. Pyelonephritis and idiopathic renal haematuria may be the same disease, because the clinical ndings, signalment (most horses are Arabian) and \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd256 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2019ultrasonographic renal changes of each disease are similar (Schumacher 2007). Blood in the urine of a neonate is likely to emanate from a cystic blood clot resulting from retrograde bleeding into the bladder caused by periparturient trauma to the umbilicus (Arnold et al. 2005). A homogeneous or heterogeneous echogenic mass is seen within the lumen of the bladder during ultrasonographic examination of the urinary tract of an affected foal. Reports of horses with haematuria caused by a congenital or acquired renal vascular anomaly rare(Johnston et 1996; Larsdotter 2009; Nogradi et al. 2013). The renal vascular anomaly of the horses described in these few reports was discovered during transcutaneous ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys. Colour- flow Doppler ultra- sonographic examination was particularly useful in diagnosing the vascular anomaly of some affected horses (Schott et al. 1996; Larsdotter et al. 2009; Nogradi et al. 2013). Radiographic examination of the abdomen of a foal with haematuria, performed after administering contrast medium into the aorta at the level of the renal artery, con rmed theTABLE 1: Conditions associated with haematuria in the horse, and clues and means of identi cation are listed ConditionClues as to cause of haematuria based on signalment and history Aids to diagnosis Urethral rent Occurs in geldings; terminal haematuria Urethroscopy; assumed to be the cause of haematuria if no other cause can be or cystoscopy Exercise-induced haematuriaHistory Other signs are nonspeci c, but weight-loss, signs of colic, and ventral oedema are commonly observedPalpating a renal mass or enlarged kidney per rectum ; ultrasonographic examination; renal palpatedCystoscopic examination; bladder mucosa; bacterial culture of urine Idiopathic renal haematuriaUsually an Arabian or Arabian-cross; blood clots in stall; often severe anaemiaCystoscopy (see blood emanating from a ureter); renal ultrasonographic exam Cantharidin toxicosis Concomitant signs of abdominal pain and/or endotoxaemia; alfalfa hay dietFinding beetles in the hay or high performance liquid chromatography testing of urine orrefluxed gastric contents NSAID-induced ulcerative cystitisAdministration of a NSAID Cystoscopy; of biopsy of a ultrasonographic examination of the bladder Renal medullary necrosis History of administration of a NSAID (e.g. phenylbutazone); dehydrationUltrasonographic exam of kidneys Renal vascular anomalies Usually a young horse Endoscopy combined with renal ultrasonography (esp.

Gross and cytological examination of the urine of horses with haematuria often identi es the probable site or cause of haemorrhage. Urinalysis is occasionally helpful in determiningthe cause of haematuria. Urine for cytological examination should be collected midstream and end-stream, so that nondiagnostic cellular debris in the urethra is eliminated before collection. Cells associated with disease of the bladder settle in the bladder so are more likely to be found in an end-stream sample, whereas cells indicative of disease of the upper portion of the urinary tract are more likely to be found in urine collected midstream . Pyuria is usually de ned as a WBC of at least 10 WBCs/ mm 3or more than ve WBCs per high-powered eld, when examining urine collected by catheterisation (Kohn andChew 1987). Observing up to eight white blood cells per high-powered eld is considered normal when cytologically examining urine collected when the horse urinates. Inability to identify bacteria during cytological examination of urine does not preclude the presence of bacteria in the urine. Pyuria can be caused by infectious or sterile in flammatory conditions, but nding clumps of WBCs increases the probability that infection is the cause of pyuria (Kohn and Chew 1987). Pyuria and associated haematuria may be associated with primary cystitis or pyelonephritis, and either of these conditio ns may be secondary to another condition, such as urolithiasis. Neoplastic cells have been found in urine of horses with haematuria caused by cystic neoplasia (Fischer et al. 1985; Sweeney et al. 1991), and a nematode may be found during urinalysis of horses with haematuria caused by the presence of Halicephalobus gingivalis in the kidney (Mayhew 1989). Eosinophils can be found in the urine of horses with haematuria caused by migration of larvae of Strongylus vulgaris through the kidney (Mahaffey and Adam 1963). Pyelonephritis may be a cause of haematuria (Kisthardt et al. 1999; Schott and Woodie 2012), and bacterial culture of renal tissue obtained by biopsy and testing of isolates for antimicrobial susceptibility may facilitate selecting an appropriate antimicrobial drug for treatment; culture of pathogenic bacteria provides supporting evidence that haematuria is caused by bacterial pyelonephritis. Renal biopsy can be performed using ultrasonographic guidance, or it can be performed blindly, after ultrasonographicallymeasuring the distance from the skin to the kidney 's capsul e. The left kidney is more dif cult to biopsy than the right kidney, because the left kidney is further from the abdominal wall and because, when biopsying the left kidney, the spleen must sometimes be penetrated to obtain renal tissue. Haematuria resulting from renal biopsy may be evident for several days. Renal biopsy is usually a safe procedure. The most common complications are haematuria, pain and fever; death caused by exsanguination is rare (Tyner et al. 2011). Biopsy of a mass within the bladder obtained using an endoscopic cut biopsy forceps is often nondiagnostic, because of the small size of harvested specimens (Hurcombe et al. 2008). A mare uterine biopsy instrument can easily be passed into the bladder of a mare to obtain tissue for histological examination; this instrument can be passed into the bladder of a male horse through a perineal urethrot omy (Fischer et al. 1985).

During micturition, haematuria was noted mid-stream with passage of blood clots occurring at the end of urination. Physical examination ndings were unremarkable aside from pale mucous membranes. Cystoscopic examination revealed intermittent passage of frank blood (with clots) from the left ureteral ori ce compared to grossly normal-appearing urine issuing from the right ureteral ori ce. Transcutaneous ultrasonographic evaluation of the right kidney yielded normal ndings while the left kidney exhibited pyelectasia, a decreased cortico-medullary ratio, and markedly increased echogenicity of the renal pelvis. Diagnosis of idiopathic renal haematuria was con rmed at necropsy. Introduction Idiopathic renal haematuria is a rare condition reported most commonly in Arabian horses (Schott 2010). No sex or age predilection has been reported. The condition is associated with sudden and often severe, frank haemorrhage originating from one or both kidneys with blood clots voided in the urine. Generally, there are no other clinical signs of disease (Schott and Hines 1994; Schott 2010, 2015). Case reports of equine idiopathic renal haematuria have been rarely described in the literature (Schott and Hines 1994; Vits et al. 2008). In the present report, we describe the endoscopic and ultrasonographic ndings associated with idiopathic renal haematuria, which was later con rmed and characterised at necropsy. Case history A 17-year-old 401 kg (885 lb) Egyptian Arabian stallion was presented to the University of Missouri Veterinary Health Center for evaluation of haematuria and blood clots in the urine of 4 days 'duration. During micturition, haematuria was noted mid-stream with passage of blood clots occurring at the end of urination. No evident pain was associated with micturition and the urine voided appeared to be appropriate in terms of volume and frequency. The stallion exhibited an appropriate attitude and mentation with normal appetite, water consumption and defaecation. The owner had treated the present problem for 3 days using trimethoprim-sulphonamide1 (25 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h) prior to evaluation, with noimprovement. A milder episode of haematuria reportedly occurred 2 years earlier but had resolved after 3 days of treatment with trimethoprim-sulphonamide (unknown dose).Clinical ndings On presentation, the rectal temperature was not obtained due to the fractious nature of the stallion. The heart rate was 36 beats/min and the respiratory rate was 12 breaths/min. Physical examination ndings were unremarkable other than pale mucous membranes observed in the oral cavity, nasal cavity and third eyelid. During the examination, the stallion voided urine with similar characteristics previously described. External inspection and palpation of the prepuce and the penis did not reveal any abnormalities. Haematological evaluation revealed mild normochromic, normocytic anaemia characterised by decreased cell count (4.98 91012/L; rr 6.80 -12.9091012/L) and decreased haemoglobin (88 110-190 g/L). There was hyper brinogenaemia (5 1 4 g/L) and lymphopoenia (1.262 9109/L, rr 1.5 -7.79109/L). during sterile cystoscopic examination, revealed 3 +haeme, 2 +protein, and >40 red blood cells/high powered eld. Urinary bacteriological culture yielded 30 CFU/mL of Sphingomonas spp., which was attributed to contamination from the endoscope. Cystoscopic examination (Fujinon EV-45OLP5/30 1.2 mm 93 m endoscope)2revealed that frank blood and clotted blood were being passed intermittently from the left ureteral ori ce compared to grossly normal-appearing urine from the right ureteral ori ce (Fig 1 ;Supplementary Item 1 ). No other abnormalities were observed via cystoscopy. As cystoscopy indicated haemorrhage originating from the upper urinary tract, speci cally the left kidney, transcutaneous ultrasonographic evaluation of both kidneys in the longitudinal and transverse planes was performed. Aside from suspicion of a mild decrease in the cortico-medullary ratio, images of the right kidney were considered to be unremarkable ( Fig 2 ). Renal artery, vein and parenchymal blood flow associated with the right kidney were considered to be within normal limits. The size (16.6 97.56 cm, normal is 15 910-11 cm [Kidd et al. 2014]) and overall echogenicity of the right renal parenchyma were also considered to be normal. Ultrasonographic examination (Philips CX50; C5-1 MHz probe)3of the left kidney revealed markedly increased echogenicity of the renal pelvis ( Fig 3 ). The renal pelvis was somewhat irregular in shape and markedly increased in size. Acoustic shadowing distal to the renal pelvis was not observed. The renal medulla was decreased in thickness. The \u00a92018 EVJ echogenicity and had normal parenchymal blood flow. The left kidney was enlarged (22910.1 cm, normal is 15 910-11 cm [Kidd et al. 2014]). No other sonographic abnormalities were identi ed. The marked increase in echogenicity and size of the left renal medulla was attributed to the presence of a large blood clot, accumulation of exudate or neoplasia affecting the renal pelvis. The lack of acoustic shadowing ruled out renal pelvic calculus (nephrolith) formation. Ultrasonographic ndings were supportive of the clinical diagnosis of idiopathic renal haematuria affecting the left kidney, although a de nitive locus of haemorrhage was not identi ed. Other differential diagnoses for unilateral renal haemorrhage included renal or vascular neoplasia, pyelonephritis (although pyuria was not evident on ns, haemorrhagic diathesis or diagnostic tests were discussed, including evaluationof coagulation (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, D-dimers and more comprehensively evaluate haemostasis, angiography for renal vascular anomalies, indirect measurement of blood pressure (Doppler using a tail cuff) to evaluate for hypertension, scintigraphy and renal biopsy to rule out pyelonephritis and neoplasia. In addition to further diagnostic testing, hospitalisation for medical or surgical treatment was offered and discussed but, due to the stallion 's age, concerns regarding future haemorrhagic crisis, and nancial considerations, the stallion was subjected to euthanasia. Post-mortem ndings Findings at gross necropsy were consistent with the clinical ndings. There were no pathological abnormalities in the right kidney or ureter. Signi cant pathological abnormalities were con rmed in the left kidney and ureter. The left kidney weighed 1950 g (normal is 600 g [Toribio 2007]) while the right kidney weighed 950 g (normal is 650 g [Toribio 2007]) ( Fig 4 ). The renal pelvis of the left kidney was dilated with coagulated blood, and the associated cortical parenchyma was red-tan and thinned ( Fig 5 left ureter and ureteral orice were enlarged ( Fig 6 ). urinary bladder contained serosanguineous fluid with blood clots. Histopathology of the left kidney revealed haemorrhage, neutrophilic in ltrates, eosinophilic debris in the renal tubules and occasional eosinophilic tubular casts. Areas of extensive haemorrhage were present throughout the renal interstitium. In this case, a primary aetiology for renal haematuria was not identi ed and the clinical diagnosis of idiopa thic (essential) renal haematuria was con rmed. Discussion The term idiopathic (or essential) renal haematuria stems from failure to identify a primary aetiological explanation for renal haemorrhage and similar conditions have been reported in both human subjects and dogs (Hitt et al. 1985; Holt et al. Fig 1: Caudal facing cystoscopic image shows active haemorrhage from the left ureteral ori ce (white arrowhead; consistent with abnormalities identi ed during ultrasonographic examination of the left kidney). The right ureteral ori ce is apparently normal (black arrowhead). Urine within the bladder isred-brown. a) b) Fig 2: Longitudinal (a) and transverse (b) ultrasonographic images of the right kidney of a 17-year-old Egyptian Arabian stallion with a4-day history of haematuria and blood clots in the urine. There is a mild decrease in the cortico-medullary ratio. The size andechogenicity of the right kidney was determined to be within normal limits. The right dorsal colon is seen ventral to the right kidney. Blood flow (via Color flow Doppler) was appropriate (not shown).

Initial intermittent episodes of renal haemorrhage often resolve spontaneously but are reported to recur over time with worsening degrees of blood loss during subsequent episodes, eventually leading to severe haemorrhage (Schott 2010). Reportedly, most horses diagnosed with idiopathic renal haematuria are subjected to euthanasia within 2 years of diagnosis (Schott 2015). Diagnosis of idiopathic renal haematuria is achieved by consideration of the clinical presentation, endoscopic demonstration of blood in ureteral urine and exclusion of other causes of renal haematuria. Differentials for haematuria in horses et al. 2002; Schumacher 2007; Vits et al. 2008). In candidate idiopathic renal haematuria cases, endoscopic examination of the bladder is essential for the identi cation of haemorrhage originating from the upper urinary tract and may reveal unilateral or bilateral disease (unilateral is more commonly reported). Uretero pyeloscopic evaluation of the associated anatomy of the equine renal pelvis has been previously described (Pasquel et al. 2013). Renal ultrasonography should be performed to rule out other causes of upper urinary tract haemorrhage including nephrolithiasis, neoplasia or renal vascular anomalies (Schott 2010).Currently, there is no consistently effective cure for idiopathic renal haematuria in horses, and supportive care (blood transfusion) for acute blood loss remains the mainstay of treatment (Schumacher et al. 2002). Drugs intended to promote haemostasis (such as aminocaproic acid and formalin) may be administered, but the ef cacy of this approach for idiopathic renal haematuria in horses is unproven a) b) Fig 3: Longitudinal (a) and transverse (b) ultrasonographic images of the left kidney in the same horse as Figure 2.

There is one report of a middle-aged Arabian mare that was treated with high dose corticosteroids and was still alive almost 3 years later (Gracia-Calvo et al. 2014). In cases of unilateral renal haematuria, surgical treatment (nephrectomy) may be considered. However, affected horses treated with unilateral nephrectomy frequently develop haemorrhage in the contralateral kidney (Schott 2010). In dogs, idiopathic renal haematuria typically occurs in otherwise healthy large-breed individuals that are <2 years old, and there is no sex predilection (Berent 2015). Treatment options have included endoscopically guided sclerotherapy with povidone iodine and/or silver nitrate, partial occlusion of the renal artery and nephrectomy (Holt et al. 1987; Mishina et al. 1997; Berent 2017). short-term follow-up, the use of povidone iodine sclerotherapy was recently reported to have been successful for the management of two affected dogs and might be considered for the treatment of horses in the future (Adelman et al. 2017). The case described in the present report illustrates sonographic ndings (pyelectasia, decreased cortical medullary ratio and marked increase in echogenicity of the renal pelvis) of an Arabian stallion that had developed idiopathic renal haematuria. A de nitive source of haemorrhage was not determined, but more extensive ante- mortem diagnostic testing could be undertaken in future cases to help better attain an aetiological explanation. Long-term prognosis for idiopathic renal haematuria in horses is guarded. Author 's declaration of interests The authors have no con flicts of interest to declare.

The normal computed tomographic anatomy of the bullae has been described in detail; however, computed tomography facilities are still limited to referral centres, and radiography remains the primary diagnostic imaging modality for most equine practitioners. The purpose of this descriptive imaging study was to describe the radiographic anatomy and limits of both DCB and VCB in equine cadaver skulls. The heads of 10 horses (7 horses, 3 ponies) of unknown age were transected sagittally in the midline, and ve radiographic projections (left and right laterolateral, left and right latero30 \u00b0dorsal - lateroventral oblique and dorsoventral) of the sinuses and nasal cavities were obtained, before and after the placement of stainless steel wire moulded inside the bullae. The radiographic appearance of the VCB and DCB was evaluated on both plain and wire radiographs, assessing their anatomical limits in relation to the cheek teeth and describing the variations related to age and type of horse. The radiographs allowed correct identi cation of the rostral and caudal limits of the DCB and of the rostral limit of theVCB in the majority of the horse heads. Mild variations in the radiographic appearance of the bullae between horse and pony heads were noted. The laterolateral projections resulted in the best visualisation of the bullae in all the heads used in the study. This study showed that the VCB and DCB are radiographically identi able on plain radiographs in most mature horses, and that pathology of these structures may be identi able using radiography. Introduction It has recently been reported that pathology of the dorsal (DCB) and ventral conchal bullae (VCB) is a relatively common and very probably underdiagnosed cause of unilateral nasal discharge in horses (Dixon et al. 2015). The paper by Dixon et al. (2015) reported that 23% of horses with paranasal sinus disorders had involvement of either the VCB or DCB detected on computed tomographic (CT) examination, and that, in most cases, lavage of the paranasal sinuses alone would not necessarily resolve empyema of the nasal conchal bullae. Dixon et al. 's paper (2015), and two other papers by the same group describing the gross, histological (Froydenlund et al. 2015) and computed tomographic (Liuti et al. 2015) anatomy of theDCB and VCB have therefore created new interest in these structures from equine clinicians. Given the anatomical complexity of the head, CT is considered to be the gold standard for imaging the equine sinonasal regions (Morrow et al. 2000; Probst et al. Brinkschulte et al. 2014; Dixon et al. 2015; Liuti et al. 2015), and the CT anatomy of the nasal conchal bullae have now been described in detail (Liuti et al. 2015). CT facilities are, however, limited to equine referral centres, and radiography remains the primary diagnostic imaging modality for most equine practices. A better knowledge of the radiographic appearance and location of these structures would therefore be helpful when dealing with cases of unilateral nasal discharge that might be associated with empyema of the nasal conchal bullae. The purpose of this study was to outline and describe the radiographic anatomy of the DCB and VCB in equine cadaver skulls and their relation to the adjacent maxillary cheek teeth. Materials and methods Ten equine cadaver heads were obtained from a localrendering plant. The heads were disarticulated between the occipital bone and the rst cervical vertebra and had been transected sagittally in the midline using a band saw. The exact age, sex and breed of the horses were unknown; therefore, the heads were categorised into one of the following two age groups based on clinical and radiographic dental examination: 0 -5 years and >5 years. The two halves of each head were reassembled by the use of four ligatures placed between the Triadan 03s and 04s (mandibular and maxillary), around the two occipital condyles and on either side of the nasoincisive notches. With the heads resting on their mandibles, ve plain radiographic projections were obtained of each head, collimating the primary beam to include the sinuses and nasal cavities. The ve projections consisted of left and right laterolateral projection, left and right latero30 \u00b0dorsal-lateroventral oblique projections and a dorsoventral (DV) projection. The images were acquired using a portable POSKOM PXP-20HF PLUS X-ray unit 1, using an exposure of 86 kV and 1.6 mAs for the lateral and lateral-oblique views and 96 kV, 1.6 mAs for the DV view, and a CANON CXDI-801C2digital radiography plate linked Sound-Eklin Mark 1210C digital radiography system3. The ligatures were then removed and the two halves of the heads were separated. Depending on the exact location of the sagittal band saw cut, the nasal septum was present on either the left or the right side of the sagittally sectioned head. The nasal septum was sharply of the dorsal and ventral conchae were sharplyexcised and removed to expose the DCB and VCB. Stainless steel wire was then cut and moulded to t inside the DV perimeter of the DCB and VCB, thus highlighting their internal walls ( Fig 1 ). Different thickness wire was used to allow differentiation between the left and the right bullae on subsequent radiographs: 14 gauge stainless steel wire was used for the DCB and VCB on the right side and 20 gauge stainless steel wire was used for both bullae on the left side. The nasal septum was replaced in its original position, the left and right halves of the heads were then joined together as previously described and the same ve radiograp hic projections were repeated. The radiographic appearance of the bullae was subjectively evaluated taking into consideration the shape, symmetry and characteristics of the DCB and the VCB separately, using a DICOM image processing application (OsiriX) 4. The rostral and caudal anatomical limits of the bullae were assessed in relation to the cheek teeth on the appropriate straight lateral projection by extending a line perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the palatine bone, dorsally, to touch both the rostral and the caudal edge of each bulla, and then recording which maxillary cheek tooth was transected by each of these lines ( Fig 2 ). To provide more speci c landmarks for the position of the bullae, the maxillary cheek teeth were subdivided into rostral and caudal halves that included the corresponding rostral and caudal tooth roots. The lines were drawn on both plain radiograp hs and radiographs with wire in place and the measurements were repeated twice for accuracy. The acquisition of the radiographs, the sharp dissection of the heads and the analysis of the data were performed by the same operator; therefore this was not a blinded study. Results Equine heads of seven horses and three ponies, all ofunknown sex and breed were obtained. Age categories included: 0 -5 years (n =2), and >5 years (n =8). Descriptive morphology and anatomical limits of the bullae The nasal conchal bullae were visible as roughly oval radiolucent structures, enclosed within a thin radiopaque wall and with a lumen divided into small cells by a variable number of thin, radiopaque, roughly vertically orientated bony septae.Laterolateral rostral the bullae were identi able on plain radiographs in all the mature horses 'heads included in the study. The DCB was irregularly oval shaped in all the equine heads, with the rostral extremity subjectively thinner caudal extremity. border was identi able as a thin radiopaque line running parallel with the dorsal nasal meatus and the nasal bone. Caudally, the bulla was adjacent to the wall of the dorsal conchal sinus (DCS), whilst rostrally the DCB elongated into a well-de ned band with soft tissue opacity that extended between the air- lled rostral limit of the DCB and the caudal aspect of the nasoincisive notch, which was consistent with the mucosal fold observed on dissection ( Fig 3 ). The VCB was always subjectively smaller in size than the DCB but also approximately oval in shape with its dorsal border running parallel with the radioluce nt line correlating to the middle nasal meatus. The bulla was continued rostrally and dorsally by a well-de ned soft-tissue opacity band that was consistent with the thick mucosal fold observed on dissection (Fig 3 ). Radiographs with wire in place Repeat radiographs after the placement of stainless steel wires con rmed the rostral limits of the DCB in seven horses and two ponies and the caudal limits of the DCB in all the equine heads. The VCB is positioned medial to the maxillary sinuses. On lateral radiographs, the VCB was positioned rostral to the rostral limit of the rostral maxillary sinus (RMS) in 40% of the cases, but it was partially superimposed on the rostral aspect of the RMS in the remaining 60% of the heads. On plain lateral radiographs, the rostral limits of the VCB could be correctly recognised in 16/ 20 bullae (as con rmed using radiographs with the wire in place), while the caudal limits were more dif cult to delineat e precisely on plain radiographs and could only be correctly identi ed in 8/20 VCB. Latero30 \u00b0dorsal-lateroventral oblique projections The dorsal border of the DCB was identi able in six of the horses 'heads and in none of the ponies and its visualisation was made more challenging due to the presence of multiplelines of superimposition emanating from the contralateral bullae and The rostroventral border of the VCB was identi able in only four heads, all of which were of horses aged >5 years ( Fig 4 ). a) b) Fig 1: The medial aspect of the right side of an equine head following excision of the nasal septum, the medial wall of the dorsal and dorsal and ventral conchal bullae before a) and after placement of stainlesssteel wires. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd265 EQUINE VETERINARY radiographs The medial and caudal walls 9/20 DCBs were visible lateral the nasal septum and rostral to the DCS ( Fig 5 ). It was not possible to identify the VCB on plain DV projections. Superimposition of the cheek teeth precluded visualisation of the rostral and lateral limits of the DCB and of the entire VCB in all skulls. Radiographs with wire in place Even with the wires in place, only the DCB was clearly identi able. The wires placed within the VCB were obscured by the mineral opacity of the teeth due to complex superimposition.The data regarding the correct identi cation of the DC and VC bullae on lateral, \u00b0dorsal-lateroventral oblique and DV plain radiographic projections are summarised in Table 1 .The details of the rostral and caudal limits of the DCB and VCB in relation to the adjacent maxillary cheek tooth are presented in Table 2 .

Eight out of 10 cadaver had symmetrically sized and symmetrically positioned nasal conchal bullae. One head (pony aged shaped but asymmetrically located nasal conchal bullae, with both the right DCB and right VCB positioned approximately 1/3 more caudal than the contralateral left bullae. One head (horse aged >5 years) had a left DCB approximately 1/3 smaller (rostrocaudally) than the contralateral side. In two cases, a rounded soft tissue radiopacity, and/or a clear fluid line(s) was visible within the DCB (n =1) or VCB projections. Excision of the medial wall of the bullae showed the presence of blood- tinged fluid and/or a solid blood clot within these structures. Additionally, some variation was observed in the thickness and shape of the mucosal fold rostral to the VCB ( Fig 2 ). This fold was visible in all the cadaver heads and was generally larger and roughly triangular shaped, with the base of the triangle at the caudal aspect, adjacent to the rostral aspect of the VCB, and the apex of the triangle extending rostrally as a soft tissue opacity band that thinned progressively as it coursed rostrally. of a cadaver equine head and b) the medial aspect of the right side of the sameequine head following excision of the nasal septum, the medial wall of both nasal frontal sinus (FS) and the rostral maxillary sinus (RMS) are also visible.

The radiographic anatomy of the DCB and VCB has been illustrated in a previous textbook (Schebitz and Wilkens1968); however, this is not readily available to most equine practitioners. The recent paper by Liuti et al. (2015) describes the CT appearance of these structures, but a review of their radiographic appearance may facilitate their identi cation in a general practice setting, where radiography remains the most readily available imaging modality. In Dixon et al. 's paper (2015), 5/10 cases did not have radiography performed, with horses being referred directly for CT examination. Reported radiographic abnormalities speci cally relating to the bullae were limited to one case, which had \"increased radiopacity of the ventral concha rostral to the sinuses \"(Dixon et al. 2015). The current paper is a descriptive study that reports the radiographic appearance, limits, and location of the VCB and the DCB in relation to the maxillary cheek teeth on plain standard radiographic projections. In the horse, the dorsal and ventral nasal conchae are simple structures, comprising two delicate scrolls of thin, mucosa-covered bone (Dyce et al. 2010). Within each dorsal and nasal concha lies an air- lled bulla. These bullae were initially de ned as the bulla situated in the recessus conchae nasalis ventralis (Schebitz and Wilkens 1968) and more 2010; International Committee on Veterinary Gross Anatomical Nomenclature 2012). In this study, the DCB was easily identi ed on straight lateral views in all the equine heads. The rostral border of the VCB was correctly identi ed on plain radiographs in all the heads of horses aged >5 years, while the location of the caudal border is more dif cult to ascertain on plainTABLE the plain wire in viewsVCB oblique viewsDCB on DV views Case 1 Horse <5 R Correct Correct Correct NV V NV V L Correct Correct Correct NV V NV V Case 2 Horse >5 R Correct Correct Correct Cd NV V NV L Correct Correct Correct Cd NV V V Case 3 Horse >5 R Correct Correct Correct Correct V V NV L Correct Correct Correct Correct V V NV Case 4 Pony >5 R Correct Correct Correct Cd NV NV NV L Correct Correct Correct Cd NV NV NV Case 5 Pony >5 R Cd Correct Ro Correct NV NV NV L Cd Correct Cd Correct NV NV V Case 6 Horse >5 R Correct Correct Correct Correct V V V L Correct Correct Correct Correct V V V Case 7 Horse >5 R Correct Correct Correct Cd V V V L Correct Correct Correct Cd V V V Case 8 Horse >5 R Correct Correct Correct Cd V NV NV L Correct Correct Correct Cd V NV NV Case 9 Horse <5 R Correct Correct Cd Cd V NV V L Correct Correct Cd Cd V NV NV Case 10 Pony >5 R Correct Correct Correct Correct NV NV NV L Correct Correct Correct Correct NV NV NV RB, rostral border; CB, caudal border; R, right bulla; Correct, correct identi cation of the bulla when compared with radiographs with wire; Cd, the actual position of the bulla limit was found to be more caudal on radiographs with wire whencompared to the estimated position on plain radiographs; Ro, the actual position of the bulla limit was found to be more rostral on radiographs with wire when compared to the estimated position on plain radiographs; NV, non visible; V, visible.

Generally, the caudal border extended further caudally than predicted on plain radiographs and was partially superimposed on the rostral limit of the rostral maxillary sinus in 60% of the skulls. The radiopacity of the mucosal fold rostral to the VCB was easily identi ed in all the heads in this study, therefore this structure may be used as a landmark in the radiographic identi cation of latero30 \u00b0dorsal-lateroventral oblique projection was more dif cult than on straight radiographs due to multiple lines of superimposition and the complex architecture of the head. Most horses with empyema of the nasal conchal bullae /C6paranasal sinuses present with unilateral disease (Dixon et al. 2015), thus identi cation of fluid lines or soft tissue opacity in the region of the bulla(e) on a straight lateral projection should be sufcient to alert the clinician to their involvement in the disease process. Although this study did not include horses with empyema of the bullae, we believe that the obliqueview may be helpful to con rm which side is affected if this is not clinically apparent. The DV view was not particularly useful in the identi cation of the DCB and VCB as it allowed evaluation of only the caudomedial aspect of the DCB, dueto superimposition of the mandible and cheek teeth on the majority of the DCB and the whole of the VCB. Furthermore, the area of projection of the DCB on the DV view is partially superimpose d on the area of the ventral conchal sinus (Tremaine and Freeman 2007), thus the presence of fluid radiopacity visible on the DV radiographic projection is difcult to interpret. This however should not undermine the value of a DV projection in cases of suspected dental diseases and sinusitis in general, as this view can still provide useful clinical information as well as giving the opportunity to evaluate potential asymmetries in shape and radiopacity within the nasal cavity and sinuses. The extent of the radiographic overlap between ventral DCS, VCB and DCB on plain DV radiographs has not been reported, and further studies would be interesting. Unfortunately, due to availability of the band-saw, the cadaver heads we used in this study had been sagittally transected prior to the acquisition of plain radiograp hs, and this created a radiolucent gap between the two halves of the head that might have somewhat disturbed the appraisal of the DV views. Acquisition of the ve plain radiographic projections before transecting the heads would have prevented this artefact. The wires were positioned in a sagittal plane in a way to highlight the dorsoventral perimeter of the bullae; thus, on DV views, the wires did not demarcate the mediolateral width of the bullae. Repositioning of the wires in the dorsal plane before the acquisition of the DV views probably would have resulted in better visualisation ofat least the DCB; however, the complete excision of the medial walls of the bullae did not provide enough support for the wires to maintain their position in the dorsal plane. The rostra l and caudal limits of both the DCB and the VCB were analysed in relation to the adjacent rostral and caudal roots of the cheek teeth. As the linear dimensions (Froydenlund et al. 2015; Liuti et al. 2015) and the volume (Liuti et al. 2015) of the bullae have already been described in detail using more accurate measures than radiography, no further measurements were evaluated in the current study.The radiographic rostral and caudal limits of the bullae in relation to the cheek teeth were similar to those previously described by Liuti et al. (2015). Broadly speaking, the larger DCBs are usually located dorsal to the maxillary 07s -09s/10s, and the relatively shorter VCBs are most commonly located dorsal to the maxillary 07s-08s/09s. Some variations in contrast and radiographic de nition of the borders of both bullae were observed. The superimposition of the maxillary cheek teeth in the two heads that were age <5 years made the caudal and ventral borders of the VCB dif cult to de ne and in one of the two cases the caudal border of the bulla was not visible at all on plain radiographs. Following dissection and wire placement, the size of the VCB in these horses was deemed to be subjectively smaller than observed in older horses. However, the sample size of this study was very small, and the cadaver heads of young horses were limited to 2/10 cases due to limited availability of young cadavers from our source. A larger number of heads aged <5 years may have provided more consistent data on size and appearance of the VCB in young horses, nevertheless similar age related variations in dimensions of the VCB have previously been described (Froydenlund et al. 2015; Liuti et al. 2015). These appear to be the result of lateral and ventral compression of the VCB by the maxillary cheek teeth apices. The generalised increased a) b) Fig 6: Latero-lateral radiographic projections of two different cadaver equine heads with presence of fluid lines into the nasal conchal bullae. In image a) the white arrow indicates a fluid line in the DCB. In image b) the white arrows indicate the presence of fluid lines in the DCBs and VCBs. The blue arrowheads indicate the margins of a radiopaque mass present in one of the DCBs.Excision of the medial walls of the bullae revealed the presence of blood in both equine heads and a blood clot in the left DCB of the horse head in image b). These ndings were deemed to be due to post -mortem bleeding and not related to ante mortem bulla pathology. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd269 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2019radiopacity of the nasal region noted in the pony heads made the identi cation of the borders of the bullae, in particular of the VCB, more challenging. This could be due to the more 'dome shaped 'head and different nasal pro le characteristics of these breeds or could be another age related variation, as the three pony heads were all included in the >5 years group. It is possible that the DCB and VCB may be more readily identi able in younger ponies, and this variation could be investigated further. In two heads, fluid lines or soft tissue opacities were visible within the bullae on plain lateral and latero30 \u00b0dorsal- lateroventral oblique radiographic projections. Following excision of the medial wall of the bullae, a quantity of blood- tinged fluid and an organised blood clot were found within them. These ndings were deemed to be related to post-mortem change rather than disease; however, they offered a useful model for the radiographic evaluation of fluid or soft tissue masses within the bullae. The VCB seems to be more predisposed than to develop empyema (80% of bullae [Dixon et al. 2015; ]); therefore, poor visualisation of this structure, whether breed or age related, could result in unsuccessful radiographic diagnosis of VCB disease. Mild variations in location and size between bullae of the right and the left sides are deemed to be a normal nding. In fact, their anatomy is usually very similar, but never identical (Froydenlund et al. 2015). In this study, it was also noted that the mucosal folds that delineate therostral border of the VCB could present some differences in shape and thickness between individual horses. Recognition of these normal variations is crucial to prevent misdiagnosis of bullae disease. In conclusion, this study has shown that on plain radiographs the DCB and the VCB may be visualised in the majority of horses, that the rostral and the caudal limits of the DCB may be located with accuracy in the majority of horses regardless of age and type and that the rostral limits of the VCB may be established in the majority of adult horses. Radiographic case studies of clinically affected horses would be a useful follow-up to this paper. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

F. Yocom* and L. D. Bass Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA. *Corresponding author has been implemented as a treatment for musculoskeletal injuries in horses. ESWT uses acoustic waves applied to a region of injury, and has been shown to improve lameness, decrease time of healing and improve ultrasonographic appearance of tendon and ligament injuries. However, much of the current literature surrounding the use of ESWT in veterinary medicine is positively biased and most studies have lower levels of evidence-based experimental design. Randomised clinical trials are needed to determine speci c energy settings, dose, frequency and case selection for different anatomical regions, and to investigate long-term effects of ESWT as well as interactions between ESWT and regenerative biological therapies. Introduction Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) was developed as a method of lithotripsy in man to break up calculi in the renal or biliary tracts (Coombs et al. 2000). While used for lithotripsy, shock waves were found to interact with the pelvis, causing increased bone density (Bischofberger et al. 2006). It has since become an adjuvant therapy for the management of various musculoskeletal injuries including tendinopathy (Waugh et al. 2015), osteoarthritis (Dahlberg et al. 2005; Zhao et al. 2013), nonunion and delayed union fractures (Kuo et al. 2015), and treatment for other musculoskeletal conditions and pathologies with variable results. Tendon and ligament injuries, osteoarthritis, and fractures are recognised causes of lameness in horses and can be career limiting or ending. Treatment may include con nement and box stall rest, nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory medications, physiotherapy and, more recently, regenerative therapies. Shockwave therapy has demonstrated a quicker return to performance in horses with proximal suspensory ligament desmitis (PSD) (Crowe et al. 2004), a shorter interval for formation of longitudinal bre patterns in super cial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) injuries (Bathe 2006), in lameness (McClure and Weinberger 2003; Frisbie et al. 2009), and improved performance in horses with back pain (Bathe 2006; Allen et al. 2010). Although not the focus of this review, ESWT has also been used to treat several other conditions in horses, including but not limited to: osteoarthritis (Revenaugh 2005; Kawcak et al. 2011), heel pain, fractures, dorsal metacarpal disease (McClure and Weinberger 2003), wounds (Link et al. 2013), and carpus valgus in foals (Bussy et al. 2013).In man, ESWT has been implemented in the treatment of plantar fasciitis, shoulder adhesive capsulitis, calci c tendinopathy of the rotator cuff, epicondylitis and enthesiopathies (Perez et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2014a,b). In patients with shoulder adhesive capsulitis, those treated with ESWT had improved range of motion and ability to perform daily activities faster than those patients treated with oral steroids (Chen et al. 2014a). Successful outcomes were seen in patients treated with ESWT for chronic proximal plantar fasciitis in 70% of cases 3 months after a single ESWT session, and in 77% of cases 12 months after treatment (Chuckpaiwong et al. 2009). In patients with tennis elbow of at least 12 months 'duration, there was a 50% or greater reduction in pain in 65% of patients treated with ESWT compared to a sham treated group (Rompe et al. 2004). These cases show promising results in tendon and ligament injuries treated with ESWT in man. This article provides a literature-based review of the use of shockwave therapy in treating equine tendon and ligament injuries, and will help provide general guidelines for the use of shockwave therapy in horses based on anatomical location of injury. Physics Extracorporeal shockwave therapy functions by creating acoustic pressure waves that can be applied to a focal region of pain or pathology. Shock waves are characterised by a rapid rise in pressure, followed by a rapid decline to a negative pressure. During the shock wave, there are direct and indirect generations of mechanical forces. The primary effect is the direct generation of mechanical forces, which occurs during the positive rise in pressure (Wang 2012). The indirect generation of mechanical forces occurs by cavitation; a process in which the tensile forces of the shock wave exceed the dynamic tensile strength of water, and as a result, cavitation bubbles are formed (Waugh et al. 2015). The cavitation bubbles implode, resulting in a secondary energy wave, which may cause a negative effect or damage to the tissues (Ogden et al. 2001; Wang 2012; Waugh et al. 2015). Focused extracorporeal shock waves can be generated by electrohydraulic, electromagnetic or piezoelectric mechanisms, all of which concentrate shock waves into small focal areas (Ogden et al. 2001; Speed 2013). Conversely, radial pulse waves (radial pressure waves, RPWs) are not focused, act super cially on the target tissues, and their penetration depth is not adjustable, as it is with focused \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd271 10.1111/eve.12780shock waves (Speed 2013). RPWs are capable of treating a larger area than focused extracorporeal shock waves, making it less necessary to use ultrasound or other imaging techniques to guide the exact location of therapy (Loske 2017). However, RPWs are not true shockwaves. Due to this and their super cial nature, RPW therapy (RPWT) may not be as effective in treating focal, deeper musculoskeletal pathologies in the horse. Table 1 provides a brief comparison of different types of ESWT and RPWT machines. The energy transmitted per unit pulse in a shockwave treatment is termed the energy flux density (EFD) and is expressed in mJ/mm2(Loske 2017). Focused shockwave sources generate a high EFD at the target tissue, whereas radial pressure wave sources generate a lower EFD at the target tissue (Loske 2017). What truly de nes EFD as low, medium or high varies widely between authors and no standard has been set. The highest energy deposition and greatest biological effects of shock waves are achieved in anatomical regions with differing tissue mediums, such as a bone-soft tissue interface (Ogden et al. 2001). The total energy applied to the tissue is equal to the number of pulses multiplied by the energy per pulse (Ogden et al. 2001). Review of molecular changes Changes to the molecular composition of tendons and ligaments by ESWT have been studied in man and animals. A recent in vivo study demonstrated that radial ESWT used on human Achilles tendons promoted proin flammatory and catabolic processes, which are associated with removing damaged tendon matrix after injury (Waugh et al. 2015). An in vitro study evaluated rat tenocytes after treatment with two ESWT energy levels (0.36 mJ/mm2and 0.68 mJ/mm2) and each level was used for 50, 100, 250 and 500 shockwaves, respectively (Chao et al. 2008). This study showed a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability immediately after shockwave in the groups receiving the highest EFD, vs. positive stimulatory effects in cell viability in groups treated with lower EFD. In addition, shockwave stimulation at 0.36 mJ/ mm2signi cantly increased collagen synthesis by tenocytes (Chao et al. 2008), indicating that using substantially higher ESWT energy levels may be detrimental to some tissues. One study in ponies used a focused ESWT source with an EFD of 0.14 mJ/mm2to show a stimulating effect on tenocyte metabolism, characterised by an increased synthesis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and total protein 3 h followingESWT (Bosch et al. 2007). Collagenase-induced suspensory ligament lesions in horses were treated with three treatments of focused ESWT with an EFD of 0.15 mJ/mm2and a total of 1500 shocks per treatment. This study showed an increase in the number of small collagen brils in treated limbs and increased expression of transforming growth factor b1 (TGF- b1), which enhances broblast synthesis of collagen, bronectin and glycosaminoglycan (Caminoto et al. 2005). These ndings should be kept in mind when performing shockwave therapy, and the practitioner should be aware of the maximum energy setting of the machine in use. In addition to tendon and ligament injuries, effects of ESWT have also been studied on injured muscle. Zissler et al. (2016) used a rat model to study the effects of a single dose of ESWT on cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury. ESWT was applied only one day after the muscle injury was induced, and muscle was harvested and evaluated at Days 4 and 7 post-injury. Results showed that ESWT increased the growth rate of regenerating muscle bres, increased number of nuclei in muscle bres, and increased proliferation and differentiation rates of treated cells (Zissler et al. 2016). Extracorporeal shockwave therapy was also shown to increase angiogenesis when applied to the Achilles tendon (near the tendon -bone junction) in rabbits. The rabbits were treated with a single shockwave treatment and the formation of neovessels was noted initially 4 weeks after treatment and persisted for at least 12 weeks (Wang et al. 2003). A similar study in dogs showed an increase in new capillary formation at 4 weeks after a single shockwave treatment to the Achilles tendon -bone junction (Wang et al. 2002). Ha et al. (2013) showed that shockwave energy levels between 0.9 mJ/mm2 and 0.16 mJ/mm2directed at endothelial cells in vitro could cause cell apoptosis and death. However, this same study used lower energy levels (0.045 mJ/mm2) in vitro and in vivo to show that shockwaves activate expression of angiogenic genes via mechanosensory complexes, indicating that lower EFD may be more bene cial for angiogenesis than higher EFD treatments. Similarly, in rats with experimentally-induced spinal cord injury that were treated with low-energy ESWT, an increase in VEGF protein expression (a protein associated with angiogenesis) was found in affected neural cells, again indicating a potential bene cial use for ESWT to increase angiogenesis (Yahata et al. 2016). ESWT and biological therapies The possibility of a symbiotic relationship between biological therapies and shockwaves has clinicians wanting to perform both therapies simultaneously. Currently, few studies have evaluated the use of ESWT with concurrent stem cell therapy for treatment of tendon or ligament injuries in horses. Using ESWT-treated equine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) ex vivo, al. (2013) showed that ASCs treated with ESWT had a higher proliferation rate and increase in kinases involved in cell growth and differentiation, and increased expression of cell-cell contact proteins. However, the study did show that excessive doses of ESWT could lead to increased cell damage and even cell death (Raabe et al. 2013). There are several human studies investigating the use of ESWT with concurrent stem cell therapy. ASCs treated with unfocused, low energy (0.09 mJ/ mm2) ESWT in vitro, were able to maintain capacity for both adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation (Schuh et al.TABLE 1: Examples of focused shock wave (SW) and radial pressure wave (RPW) systems available to practitioners (this is notan inclusive list) SW or RPW Machine Focused SW -electromagnetic 20192014). A separate study using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMDMNCs) in vivo showed that, when used in conjunction, cardiac tissue treated with ESWT- treated BMDMNCs had the lowest expression of indices of inflammation compared to cardiac tissue treated with ESWT or BMDMNCs alone (Sheu et al. 2015). These human studies used lower energy settings and fewer pulses compared to the Raabe et al. (2013) study, which used similar settings to studies evaluating ESWT treatment of tendon and ligament injuries in horses. Further studies need to be performed to investigate whether unfocused, low energy ESWT could be bene cial if used in conjunction with stem cell therapy in tendon and ligament injuries in horses. There is not currently a published standard recommendation for a duration of time between administration of local stem cell injection and ESWT; however, based on these ndings the concurrent use of ESWT with local stem cell injection may not be advisable. There are no studies to determine the ef cacy of performing ESWT prior to stem cell administration, but this may also be a consideration for some practitioners. Safety There have been reports of detrimental effects of ESWT. In a study using ESWT on ultrasonographically normal flexor and extensor tendons, as well as suspensory ligaments, histological changes were seen after treatment (Bosch et al. 2009). These tendons and ligaments were treated with 600 shocks at 0.14 mJ/mm2and were evaluated both 6 weeks and 3 h after ESWT. There were increased numbers of irregularly distributed tenocytes, loss of regular collagen wave pattern, and disruption of collagen bres in the ESWT treated tendons. In addition, it was noted that none of the ponies in the study showed any lameness following ESWT, but all ponies had mild swelling and pain on palpation in the super cial digital flexor tendon for 2 -3 days following treatment to this region. Based on this study, it may be contraindicated to perform ESWT on normal tendons or ligaments, and so clinicians should be encouraged to focus their ESWT on the region of injury and not move into normal tissues if possible. Conversely, there are reports indicating that ESWT is a safe, effective therapy. ESWT stimulated osteogenesis in the long bones of rabbits (Qin et al. 2010), and one study in the horse revealed that although high levels of energy resulted in bone formation, no damage to surrounding soft tissues and no signs of bone microfractures were seen (McClure et al. 2000). A separate study treated the origin of the suspensory ligament and the fourth metatarsal bone with two separate ESWT treatments, and showed no evidence of cortical microfracture (Bischofberger et al. 2006). It is not recommended to use ESWT on active physes, as studies have demonstrated premature closing of physes in laboratory animals after ESWT (McClure and Weinberger 2003). Analgesia In human patients, ESWT can provide pain relief for 3 -4 days after treatment, although this mechanism of action remains unknown (McClure and Weinberger 2003). In one human study using ESWT for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis, patients reported a statistically signi cant decrease in pain score in 25 out of 30 patients after a single treatment. Resultswere recorded between 33 and 255 days after treatment (Hyer et al. 2005). Horses with experimentally induced osteoarthritis showed decreased lameness scores 7 days following ESWT, suggesting this nding was due to decreased in flammation rather than an immediate analgesic effect (Frisbie et al. 2009). Additionally, a series of case studies reported that horses that were refractory to intra-articular injections for the treatment of osteoarthritis had improved lameness scores after shockwave therapy (Revenaugh 2005). In horses treated with ESWT for chronic unilateral forelimb lameness, no signi cant decrease in observable lameness was seen; however, a signi cant increase in peak vertical force of the lame limb was noted both 8 h and 2 days following ESWT. This increase in peak vertical force would indicate the horses were more willing to bear weight on the lame limb, and could be correlated to an improvement in lameness. These ndings suggest that analgesia caused by ESWT may last at least up to 2 days and thus horses should not be exercised heavily immediately following ESWT (Dahlberg et al. 2006). Contrary to these studies, one report of 16 horses with con rmed proximal palmar metacarpal or rmed or presumptive PSD could not demonstrate an analgesic effect resulting in any immediate reduction in lameness after one ESWT treatment (Imboden et al. 2009). In the same study, no changes in skin sensitivity or in thermographic imaging were noted after ESWT. It may be possible that if this study had included peak vertical force intheir measurements, the results may have been similar to those of Dahlberg et al. (2006). Additionally, in a separate study, no attenuation in skin sensation was seen in horses up to 48 h after being treated with either focused or RPW therapies directly over the palmar digital nerve (Waldern et al. 2005). Because of the potential analgesic and gait altering effects listed above, the use of ESWT is regulated in equine competitions. Currently, F /C19ed/C19eration Equestre Internationale regulations state that shockwave therapy is not permitted during the period of the event, nor in the 5 days prior to the start of the period of the event (F /C19ed/C19eration Equestre Internationale Veterinary Regulations 2016). The National Thoroughbred Racing Association 's 2016 Safety and Integrity Alliance Code of Standards states that any horse that receives shockwave therapy may not breeze or race for 10 days following treatment and that any ESWT or RPWT machine must be registered and approved, and only used by a licensed veterinarian. It also states that the use of ESWT or RPWT must be reported within 24 h prior to treatment and that any horse treated shall be added to a list of ineligible horses. The US Equestrian Federation 's 2016 Guidelines for Drugs and Medications recommends a 3-day withdrawal from competition following extracorporeal shockwave therapy, and prohibits the use of any shockwave therapy within the 12 h prior to competition. US Equestrian Federation guidelines do allow extracorporeal shockwave therapy to be administered by a licensed veterinarian within 3 days prior to competition, but only to the back and dorsal pelvis area. Rules and regulations should be investigated prior to administering ESWT to competition horses. Equipment There are various shockwave machines available for use in equine practice. Each machine may be equipped with \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd273 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2019different probes and the capability to adjust the number of shocks (pulses), depth, and energy settings. Because the settings and machines used in the studies in this paper vary, the information for settings used in each article are provided so that clinicians can compare these settings to their own machine. Table 1 provides a list of some commonly used extracorporeal and radial shock wave machines in equine veterinary medicine. Review of ESWT and speci c soft tissue injuries Research surrounding speci c soft tissue injuries and response to ESWT in horses is limited. The following section provides areview of ESWT in soft tissue injuries based on current literature. Suspensory ligament desmitis Suspensory ligament injuries can occur at various points alongthe length of the ligament; however, racehorses have more injuries of the mid body and/or branches, while sport horses have more injuries of the proximal suspensory ligament and/ or branches (Hinchcliff et al. 2004). Horses used for dressage, having a straight hock conformation, or exhibiting hyperextension of the metatarsophalangeal joint, have been found to have a higher incidence of hindlimb PSD (Dyson 2007). Lameness due to hindlimb PSD tends to be more severe and more persistent than lameness caused by forelimb PSD, which is likely related to a compartment syndrome developing in the hindlimbs and subsequent compression on the plantar metatarsal nerves (Dyson and Ross 2003). This may help explain why the prognosis for hindlimb PSD remains worse than in the forelimb. Lameness in horses with hindlimb PSD improved faster and a greater percentage of horses improved when treated with RPWT, compared to a similar study where RPWT was not used (Crowe et al. 2004). In this study, 41% of horses with chronic hindlimb PSD returned to their previous level of work 6 months after treatment with RPWT. In a separate study, only 12.5% of horses treated with rest and controlled exercise returned to full work for a year or more without recurrent lameness (Dyson 1994). In the RPWT group, all horses had ultrasonographic evidence of PSD and 24% of horses had radiographic abnormalities of the proximoplantar aspect of the third metatarsal bone. There was no reported correlation between these ndings and outcome (Crowe et al. 2004). In the study evaluating rest alone, 97% of horses had ultrasonographic evidence of PSD and 54% of horses had radiographic abnormalities (Dyson 1994). Because there was no correlation between outcome of RPWT and radiographic ndings, it is unlikely that this played a role in the differences between the two studies. It should also be noted that the Crowe et al. (2004) study used RPWs, which, as stated previously, are not focused shock waves, are super cial in penetration (the machine used in this study had a 15 mm penetration depth), and so, although the horses improved, it is unclear if they would have had greater improvement with focused ESWT treatment. Crowe et al. (2004) also reported that 53% of horses with chronic forelimb lameness (lame for 3 months or more) associated with suspensory ligament lesions were sound and in full work 6 months after treatment with RPWT. Lischer et al. (2007) reported that 61.8% of horses treated with ESWT for forelimb PSD returned to full work 6 months after diagnosis,and 55.9% were still in full work one year after diagnosis. However, this same study showed that only 40.9% of horses treated with ESWT for hindlimb PSD returned to full work 6 months after diagnosis, and that only 18.2% of horses were still in full work one year after diagnosis. These results may indicate that ESWT and RPWT can return horses with forelimb PSD to work faster than rest alone; however, the overall prognosis for hindlimb PSD remains poorer than the prognosis for forelimb PSD. four horses with collagenase-induced forelimb suspensory ligament desmitis, ESWT resulted in faster lling of the defects and improved bre alignment when examined ultrasonographically, compared to untreated limbs (McClure et al. 2004). This study did not have a blinded ultrasonographer, which could have altered the interpretation of the ultrasonographic ndings. Caminoto et al. (2005) used a hindlimb collagenase-induced PSD model and showed increased production of TGF- b1, greater decrease in proportion of the affected ligament, and faster lling of the defects in those limbs treated with ESWT, compared to untreated limbs. It is possible that collagenase- induced lesions do not respond the same as naturally occurring lesions, so these studies may not provide an accurate representation of lesions seen in clinical practice. Each of these studies used similar, yet slightly different ESWT energy settings, which could cause differing results, and suggests that speci c parameters for ESWT studies need to be established. Super cial digital flexor tendonitis Super cial digital flexor tendon lesions can be located within the central portion of the tendon, anywhere along the length of the metacarpal/metatarsal region and, less commonly in the region of the digital tendon sheath (Hinchcliff et al. 2004). Kersh et al. (2006) showed increased capillary formation in collagenase-induced SDFT tendonitis treated with ESWT. Histologically, the treated limbs had increased numbers of capillaries, but there were no ultrasonographic differences between treated and untreated limbs. Bathe (2006) anecdotally reported faster ultrasonographic resolution of naturally occurring lesions and more rapid development of a longitudinal bre pattern when ESWT was used in the treatment of mild or chronic SDFT tendonitis. Anecdotal evidence is not critically reviewed, and has no control groups, so should be interpreted cautiously. Accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon Damage to the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon (ALDDFT/inferior check ligament) is often related to SDFT injuries, but can occur as an isolated injury (Hinchcliff et al. 2004). Using an ALDDFT collagenase-induced model, no signi cant ultrasonographic or ligament microstructure changes were seen in ESWT treated limbs compared to controls (Waguespack et al. 2011). Based on the limited studies surrounding treatment of ALDDFT lesions with ESWT, it is unknown if this is an appropriate treatment. Back pain Based on anecdotal evidence, McClure and Weinberger(2003) found up to 100% improvement in pain and rider satisfaction in horses with mild pain along the dorsal spinous processes (DSPs), but only 65% improvement in severely horses. Bathe (2006) reported analgesic \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd274 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2019effects of ESWT when used in three successive treatments for back pain (DSPs, caudal thoracic arthropathy, supraspinous ligament strains, or non-speci c soft tissue pain). The three treatments provided analgesia for up to 5 months, depending on the horse. Allen et al. (2010), showed improvement in 89% of 74 horses treated for back pain; 30% of horses improved for 2 -4 months, 28% of horses improved for 4 -6 months, and 31% of horses improved for >6 months. These horses were treated with multiple modalities and no control horses were used, so it cannot be determined how much of a role ESWT played in these horses 'improvement. It should also be noted that these parameters were based on anecdotal experience, not experimental evidence, so can be used a guideline, but have not been scienti cally proven as treatment parameters. Speci c literature recommendations Proximal suspensory ligament injury (hindlimb) Crowe et al. (2004) reported faster resolution of lameness in horses treated with RPWT compared to horses in a previous study treated with rest and gradual return to exercise alone. Horses received three total treatments (time 0, 2, and 4 weeks after initial diagnosis) of 2000 pulses at 10 Hz (1000 pulses applied to each the medial and lateral aspects of the limb, directed towards the plantar aspect of MTIII; Swiss Dolorclast Vet5). Caminoto et al. (2005) reported increased production of TGF- b1, greater decrease in proportion of the affected ligament, and faster lling of the defects in those limbs treated with ESWT compared to untreated limbs. Horses received three total treatments, 3 weeks apart; 1500 pulses were applied with an energy of 0.15 mJ/mm2; 500 pulses to the medial and lateral aspects of the lesion with a 5 mm probe, and 500 pulses to the plantar aspect of the lesion with a 35 mm probe (Versatron2). Proximal suspensory ligament injury (forelimb) McClure et al. (2004) and McClure and Evans (2002) reported faster lling of PSD lesions and decrease in percentage of cross sectional area on ultrasonographic examination with three treatments, 3 weeks apart. Each treatment consisted of 500 pulses from the palmar aspect of the limb with a 35 mm probe, and 500 pulses from palmar -medial and palmar -lateral directions with a 5 mm probe, for total of 1500 pulses. In one study (McClure et al. 2004), these pulses were administered at 0.14 mJ/ mm2, and in a second study (McClure and Evans 2002) at 0.13 mJ/mm2(Equitron2). ALDDFT Waguespack et al. (2011) showed no signi cant ultrasonographic or ligament microstructure changes in ESWT-treated limbs in a collagenase-induced model. Each treatment consisted of 500 pulses at 0.15 mJ/mm2using a 20 mm probe, directed to the medial and lateral aspect of the limb, palmar to the second and fourth metacarpal bones. Three treatments were performed, 3 weeks apart (Versatron2).Super cial digital flexor tendonitis (forelimb) Kersh et al. (2006) showed increased neovascularisation, but no ultrasonographic changes in treated vs. untreated horses using three treatments, 3 weeks apart. Each treatment was with a 5 mm probe, using 1500 pulses at 0.14 mJ/mm2 (Equitron2). Back pain Allen et al. (2010) reported ESWT guidelines for spinous process impingement (SPI) and dorsal articular process (DAP) osteoarthritis cases (based on anecdotal evidence). For SPI, a 35 mm probe was used axially and abaxially over the entire length of the thoracolumbar spinous processes. For DAP, an 80 mm probe was used abaxially over the left and right sides of the vertebral column. These treatments were performed with 1000 -2000 pulses per session at the highest energy level available. Horses had 2 days rest following each treatment, followed by 3-5 days of gradual return to exercise. Further therapy was anywhere from 4 to 12 months apart, based on response (Versatron2). McClure and Weinberger (2003) provided guidelines based on anecdotal treatment successes: for horses with bone sclerosis of the DSPs, 50 pulses at an energy setting of 0.15 mJ/mm2with a 35 or 80 mm probe was performed on both right and left sides for every 1 cm length of bony sclerosis. Five treatments were performed at 2 -4 week intervals over 1-3 months. Conclusions The use of ESWT in soft tissue injuries in horses has been shown to be bene cial in healing certain injuries and provides an analgesic effect. ESWT can be successfully used to treat proximal suspensory ligament injuries, both in returning horses to performance faster, and lling of defects when examined ultrasonographically. ESWT may help to ll in defects in the SDFT more quickly, but no conclusion can be made regarding the degree of lameness or return to function. The evidence for ESWT successfully treating injuries to the ALDDFT is limited, so we do not feel a conclusion can be made regarding ESWT as an appropriate treatment for these injuries. Horses treated with ESWT for back pain were noted to have less back pain; however, many of these horses were simultaneously treated with other therapies, so the bene to f ESWT alone cannot be de nitively determined. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) can be a safe and successful therapy depending on the anatomical region treated, severity of injury, and interactions of other treatments being performed on the horse. Speci c treatment protocols validating energy settings, probes, and the number of pulses to be applied per therapy have yet to be determined in a research setting. Further research may be able to help specify what settings provide both faster and more effective healing of injuries, and may help to determine at what interval ESWT should be applied. Researching the timing of ESWT in cases where regenerative biological therapies are used would beimportant in determining appropriate ESWT protocols. Comparing horses treated with ESWT alone to horses treated \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd275 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2019with regenerative medicine therapies and ESWT would also provide insight, as many horses are treated with multiple modalities, making it dif cult to determine which is the most bene cial. It may also be bene cial to determine long-term bene ts of ESWT to determine if horses treated with ESWT remain sound compared to horses treated with other methods.

It encompasses a spectrum of disease and is associated with various clinical signs. Pergolide (Prascend) is the only licensed medicine for treatment of the clinical signs associated with PPID. Some of these associated clinical signs may be more amenable to therapy than others. Laminitis is a multifactorial condition with elusive pathogenesis. PPID is a risk factor for laminitis, however, its strength as an independent risk factor and interactions with other risk factors remain poorly de ned. Question In horses diagnosed with PPID, does pergolide treatment reduce the risk of an episode of laminitis (occurrence or recurrence) compared with no treatment or other PPID treatments? Search strategy Literature searches were conducted for articles published inEnglish on the Medline database (inception to February 2017) and (by RCVS Knowledge) of the CAB Abstracts database (1973 to February 2017). Search terms included 'equine ', 'pituitary ','laminitis 'and 'pergolide '. Articles were appraised if they were original studies including at least ve cases of PPID treated with pergolide and reported clinical signs of laminitis during/following treatment. Review articles and expert opinion were excluded. The quality of the evidence was appraised based on guidelines from human medicine (Higgins and Green 2011; OCEBM-Levels-of- Evidence-Working-Group 2011). The manufacturers of Prascend (Boeringher Ingelheim) were contacted to request any additional data. Prascend licensing data were obtained from the Veterinary Medicines Directorate and the Food and Drug Administration. Search outcome Forty-one papers were initially retrieved, a report of the licensing study was also included. Critical appraisal revealed no suitable evidence to address the question. The most common reasons for not including papers was incomplete reporting of laminitis or a lack of original data (i.e. expert-opinion papers). The question was widened to include studies that reported improvement in laminitis present at the onset of treatment. No high-quality evidence was found to answer this wider question. The retrieved literature includes clinically useful data and forms a basis for further research but, whenassessed in the context of current appraisal guidelines, the evidence was considered to be limited, at high risk of bias from several sources and incompletely reported. The most informative studies are summarised in Table 1 . Discussion There is insuf cient evidence to conclude that in horses with PPID pergolide treatment reduces the risk of laminitis occurrence or recurrence compared with no treatment or other treatments. The lack of high-quality evidence does not exclude the possibility of a bene cial effect but research should seek to determine if such a bene t exists and the number of animals that would require treatment to prevent a case of laminitis. Improvement of an episode of laminitis that was already present at the start of treatment was also considered. Several studies report improvement in the clinical signs of laminitis during treatment with pergolide. However, such improvements cannot be attributed to pergolide rather than other interventions such as farriery, rest or analgesia. Similar rates of laminitis improvement have also been reported with cyproheptadine (Perkins et al. 2002) and trilostane (McGowan and Neiger 2003) but comparisons may be hampered by differences between the treated groups. In some cases laminitis developed for the rst time during pergolide treatment, in other cases laminitis recurred or did not improve during pergolide treatment. When considering treatment options clinicians should weigh the potential bene ts of treatment against the risk of adverse effects. Pergolide appears well-tolerated and owner satisfaction with long-term use is reported to be good (Schott et al. 2001; Anon, 2011; Rohrbach et al. 2012). Some studies that described clinical improvement with treatment were not included in the appraisal as signs of laminitis following treatment were not reported clearly. The effects of pergolide treatment on clinical signs of PPID other than laminitis are also relevant to prescribing decisions. Further research could consider the strength of PPID as an independent risk factor for laminitis and the interactionsbetween insulin regulation and PPID. The risk (incidence/year) of laminitis in horses with PPID is not well-described and reported effects of pergolide treatment on insulin dysregulation are inconsistent. The prevalence of laminitis in the wider population of horses with PPID may be lower than in those that present to veterinary hospitals (McGowan et al. 2013). Any potential bene ts of pergolide on laminitis would depend on the circumstances of each patient and their pretreatment risk of laminitis but current evidence does not support the widespread use of pergolide to prevent laminitis. \u00a92018 10.1111/eve.12903Author 's declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Effects of a dietary supplement on in- sulin and adipokine concentrations in Concentrations Following OST Challenge Supplementation with InsulinWise significantly reduced insulin blood levels, signifying increased insulin sensitivity. InsulinWise Supported a Decrease in Insulin Resistance In four of the horses previously identified as insulin resistant, insulin regulation reverted to levels classified as normal after supplementation with InsulinWise. Insulin Levels at 60 Minutes During Oral Sugar Tests from 2013 to 2017 Over time, EMS horses became more insulin resistant. Supplementation with InsulinWise significantly reduced insulin levels in the blood, signifying a decrease in insulin resistance.Insulin resistance exhibited in horses suffering with equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) and pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) has become more and more prevalent in our aging equine community. Decreasing insulin resistance and controlling weight through dietary supplementation can provide a benefit by decreasing laminitis risk. InsulinWise: equine testing. You no longer have to compromise.
