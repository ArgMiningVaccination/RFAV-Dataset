The body cannot make or store vitamin C. It has to be obtained from the diet and supplements. It is well accepted that vitamin C is an essential micronutrient. However, its use in megadose quantities remains controversial, as does the use of high-dose vitamin C in cancer treatment. What is vitamin C infusion therapy? Vitamin C can be taken by mouth (orally) or given by intravenous infusion directly into the bloodstream. When it is given intravenously, much higher blood levels of vitamin C are reached compared to when it is ingested by mouth. How much is a megadose of vitamin C? Any dose above 1 gram of vitamin C per day is considered a megadose quantity.1 Can IV Vitamin C cure cancer? Experiments with vitamin C for cancer treatment date back several decades. The well-known Scottish surgeon Ewan Cameron and two-time Nobel-laureate Linus Pauling treated 100 terminally ill cancer patients with vitamin C in the 1970s. They compared these patients to controls who were treated at the same hospital for a similar type of cancer and clinical stage but did not receive vitamin C. The results showed that the patients treated with vitamin C had a four times higher average survival time. A follow-up study found that 22 percent of cancer patients treated with vitamin C survived one year compared to 0.4 percent of those who did not receive the treatment.1 Subsequently, the Mayo Clinic conducted randomized double-blind trials on the use of vitamin C in cancer patients. These trials failed to demonstrate any positive effects of high-dose vitamin C in cancer patients. However, the Mayo Clinic trials consisted of vitamin C treatment for an average of 2.5 months, whereas the Pauling-Cameron study lasted for 12 years. Also, the Mayo Clinic study consisted of 10 grams of vitamin C by mouth. The Pauling-Cameron trial administered vitamin C both orally and intravenously, producing 25 times higher peak plasma concentrations. This suggests that intravenous administration of vitamin C can achieve and sustain high plasma levels that are sufficient to kill cancer cells.1 It remains controversial whether high-dose intravenous vitamin C alone can cure cancer. However, experts agree that vitamin C can boost the effectiveness of conventional cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy.2 Can Vitamin C prevent cancer? Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University have shown vitamin C and other antioxidants can prevent the growth of some tumors.3 Other studies have found that daily vitamin C supplementation can reduce the incidence of many types of cancer, including oral, pharyngeal, esophageal, gastric, and cervical cancers. Vitamin C rich foods are thought to prevent lung and colon cancers.4 However, large-scale trials have not demonstrated that vitamin C supplements can prevent cancers.5 How does vitamin C kill cancer cells? Certain molecules called oxygen free radicals are known carcinogens, i.e., they cause cell damage and stimulate the development of cancer.6 Vitamin C is an antioxidant that prevents cancer growth by grabbing up these free radicals. Vitamin C does not allow free radicals to damage the DNA in cells.2 Scientists have also found that antioxidants like vitamin C destabilize tumor cells and prevent them from growing.3 Vitamin C cancer treatment At present, the US FDA has not approved the use of high-dose intravenous vitamin C for cancer treatment. Scientists are still investigating whether intravenous megadose quantities of vitamin C can prevent and cure cancer. Nonetheless, many studies have shown that cancer patients who receive IV vitamin C have a better quality of life and fewer side effects from cancer treatments.7 Doses of vitamin C up to 1.5 grams/kilogram of body weight is considered safe in most patients with very few side "}
