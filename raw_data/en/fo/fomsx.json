If you consume fiber regularly, your body will thank you. You need fiber for a healthy digestive system, better bowel movements and it also provides a slew of other health benefits including lowered risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Fiber comes from a range of plant foods, and it is a type of carbohydrate that is indigestible, meaning you don't break it down and use it for glucose like other carbohydrates, since it passes through your body relatively intact. There are two main types of fiber \u2014 soluble and insoluble \u2014 and they play different roles. Soluble fiber is important for digestion and lowering cholesterol and blood sugar while insoluble fiber is associated with improving regularity. You need both types of fiber for a healthy body, yet unfortunately, many Americans are not consuming enough, falling short of the daily recommended intake set by the [U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf) which recommends 25 grams for women per day and 38 grams for men.

What to look for when shopping for the best fiber supplements Food first is always the ideal way to get in your daily fiber intake with supplements available to help to fill in the gaps. Food sources of fiber contain vitamins, minerals and antioxidants which supplements cannot always provide. If you are unable to meet your dietary fiber intake through your diet or choose to take a fiber supplement, here are some things to consider: Form: There are a variety of fiber supplement forms available, including capsules, powders and gummies. If you don't like swallowing capsules, there are other options to choose from. Pay attention to serving size as many fiber supplement brands recommend multiple dosages throughout the day. Additionally, if you have any swallowing difficulties, check with your healthcare provider before adding a fiber supplement to your diet as they can thicken when added to a liquid and become dangerous to swallow. They also need to be taken with an adequate amounts of water or other liquids. Amount: Although dietary fiber does not have a tolerable upper limit, it can cause digestive distress if too much is taken too quickly. Therefore it is recommended to increase intake slowly and with adequate amounts of fluids. Some brands recommend spreading out dosages throughout the day so make sure to follow suggested usage instructions. Again, it is always best to speak with your healthcare provider before adding any new supplement to your regimen. Price: Fiber supplements can vary greatly in price and therefore we've listed a range of picks to suit all budgets. As with most things, higher prices are not necessarily a good indicator of quality. What is the difference between soluble and insoluble fiber? There are two main types of fiber: soluble and insoluble, and both types are recommend for optimal health. According to Cabrero, it is important to note that most plant-based foods have a combination of both types of fiber, and depending on the condition you want to treat, you may want to highlight one over the other. Soluble fiber: As the name implies, this type of fiber dissolves in water. \"It acts like a sponge and can help bulk up your stool, softening it and making it easier to pass,\" Cabrero says. \"Many soluble fibers are also fermentable fibers,\" and can help to create a healthy gut microbiome because \"they are the food of choice for beneficial bacteria.\" It is associated with slowing digestion time, [can help you feel fuller longer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6352252/) and may aid in weight management. It is also associated with a [decreased risk of heart disease, improved blood sugar control and decreased cholesterol levels.](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/health-benefits-dietary-fibers-vary) Insoluble fiber: This type of fiber does not dissolve in water but it works to bulk your stool and it can help [promote regular bowel movements](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/116/4/953/6639855) and prevent constipation. It is often found in plant foods that seem rough or stringy, or have a tough skin, hull, peel, pod or seeds. For this reason, insoluble fiber is often referred to as \"roughage,\" according to Cabrero. \"Insoluble fiber can help regulate bowel movements by creating mechanical stimulation and triggering motility,\" she adds. Food sources of fiber: Most plant foods contain a combination of both soluble and insoluble fiber and the best way to get fiber in your diet is to eat a diet diverse in fruits and vegetables. \"Eat what you like and what feels more comfortable to your gut and your palate,\" Cabrero says. If fiber-rich foods tend to contribute to gas or bloating, Cabrero recommends \"sometimes modifying textures such as cooking, blending or finely chopping, [which] can help the digestibility.\" Examples of foods that are a rich source of fiber include: - Fruit: Blueberries, raspberries, kiwi, oranges, pears, avocados - Vegetables: Broccoli, cooked spinach, Brussels sprouts, kale - Legumes: Lentils, edamame, split pea or black beans - Whole grains: Oats, bran cereal, kasha or bulgur, high fiber bread (4 to 7 grams of fiber per serving) - Seeds: Chia, ideally soaked in water - Nuts: Pistachios or almonds What are the health benefits of fiber? Fiber and fiber supplements have been associated with a wide range of health benefits. Here are some of the top health conditions that it may help with: May lower cardiovascular disease risk. According to registered dietitian and pre-diabetes specialist [Jackie Topol, MS, RD](https://www.jackietopol.com/), soluble fiber \"has been shown to help with lowering cholesterol levels as well as improving blood sugar control.\" According to [research](https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31809-9/fulltext), consumption of at least 25 grams of fiber per day is associated with lower cholesterol and blood pressure as well as a decreased risk of dying from heart disease, stroke and colon or breast cancer. [Additional studies](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2790576) show that higher intake of dietary fiber is associated with lower inflammation levels and therefore decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Bowel regularity. Fiber works to feed healthy gut bacteria and improve digestion to keep you regular. It also adds bulk to your stool and Topol explains that \"insoluble fiber does not dissolve and remains intact as it is digested, thereby helping move bulk through the intestines and promoting regular bowel movements. Consumption of insoluble fiber is associated with decreased cardiovascular risk and colon cancer risk.\" May keep blood sugar regulated. According to the [Center for Disease Control (CDC),](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/features/role-of-fiber.html) soluble and insoluble fiber does not increase your blood sugar the way other carbohydrates can because your body doesn't absorb them. [Studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jdi.13377) also show that an increased intake of both soluble and insoluble fiber can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, especially a diet rich in legumes and vegetables. The study indicates that higher levels of insoluble fiber intake can lead to lower levels of inflammation in the body and therefore lowered risk of type 2 diabetes. May promote weight loss. \"Soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance,\" Topol says. \"It slows down digestion and assists the body in absorbing vital nutrients from foods.\" The decreased digestion time may help people to feel fuller longer and in turn help them to eat less. Also, a [recent study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000291652201022X?via%3Dihub) showed that participants that consumed a soluble fiber supplement lost more weight and decreased their waist circumference when compared to a group consuming the same diet but not taking the supplement. Who should avoid fiber supplements? In certain situations, fiber supplements might do more harm than good. If you experience bloating, some fiber supplements might make it worse, since the fibers used may cause more fermentation or air in the gut. \"If you are someone that suffers from constipation and have slow motility, adding fiber can fuel the fire if you are not moving your bowels consistently,\" Cabrero says. \"Fiber is the part of the food that humans do not digest, so what goes in must come out. If you have IBS or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) you may find insoluble fibers, in supplements and food, more triggering, especially if you suffer more from diarrhea or urgent stools.\" Topol advises, \"fiber supplements can interact and reduce the effectiveness of some medications like certain blood-thinning medications, thyroid medications and some antidepressants.\" The timing of when you take the supplement in conjunction when you take medications should be considered. Additionally, if you have a wheat allergy, intolerance or sensitivity, you should avoid any fiber supplements made from wheat. As always, it's always best to speak with your healthcare provider before starting a new supplement. Why trust Good Housekeeping?
