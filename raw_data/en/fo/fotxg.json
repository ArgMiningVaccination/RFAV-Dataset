A natural pharmaceutical science, homeopathy uses minute doses of pure extracts from all realms of nature. Mixed in precise combinations, these ingredients become potent health formulas that help clear nerve interference and activate the body's restorative power. Homeopathy recognizes that symptoms are not the disease, but rather the result of the body's effort to cope with an underlying problem. Symptoms are actually the body's way of restoring balance and wellness. Homeopathy targets underlying causes not symptoms. This helps the body cure disease naturally, gently and promptly without the threat of side effects or negative drug interactions. Suppressive vs. Expressive Treatment When symptoms are suppressed by conventional drug therapy, a true cure becomes less likely. Certain strong drugs that overwhelm the body's inherent tendency to heal can seriously weaken the immune system and other defense processes. A weakened immune system is more susceptible to serious physical and mental illness. As symptoms are suppressed they are driven deeper into the mental/emotional and physical levels. Because homeopathy is an expressive rather than a suppressive therapy; underlying causes are corrected and symptoms clear rather than being driven deeper into the body. Homeopathy is designed to express Health and life at its highest level. The law of Similars The active principle of homeopathy is a verified law of pharmacology: the Law of Similars. This law states that a dilution of a certain substance can remove the symptoms which that substance, in larger amounts, is capable of evoking. For example, if one drinks too much coffee, the mind races and it is difficult to sleep; the nervous system is on edge and trembling may occur. A homeopathic dose of coffee will gently promptly reverse these symptoms. The fields of genetics, physics, chemistry and immunology also incorporate the Law of Similars. Because the doses are so small and the preparations naturally pure, homeopathy has no side effects or known harmful reactions with other drugs.
