Mike Rhodes chaired NAM with characteristic modesty and sureness from the Manual's inception in 1987 to his death in 1991. He played a vital role in ensuring the Manual's successful development, building on its foundation in London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard. It was particularly important in 1987 to produce a clear, plain language resource in the face of the extensive misinformation promulgated about HIV and AIDS, much of it confused and homophobic. The Manual soon became the primary resource used by professionals and volunteers alike in the rapidly growing response to the epidemic. As its users have grown and diversified, so the Manual has constantly been revised, rewritten and adapted to take account of new needs. Most importantly, what was originally intended as a resource for advisors has increasingly become a source of information for all those most affected, particularly people living with HIV and AIDS. The Manual was also dedicated to Simon Mansfield, a trustee of NAM, on his death in 1993. He had worked tirelessly and with utmost dedication to provide a model of good AIDS care and treatment in the community. NAM Publications is now a charity aiming to support the fight against AIDS and HIV with relevant, up-to-date, accurate and comprehensive information. NAM aims to be the leading provider of high quality, accessible resources to enable organisations and individuals to overcome prejudice and to take action and control in responding to AIDS and HIV.

As a syndrome AIDS can be manifest in a wide variety of ways. Unlike most diseases AIDS is not characterised by a set of clinical features common to each patient. AIDS is the result of damage to the immune system: the resultant deficiency in its functions allows certain specific 'opportunistic' infections or tumours to flourish. These are called opportunistic because they are caused by organisms which are normally not pathogenic but which 'take the opportunity' to cause disease in an individual whose immune system has been damaged. The opportunistic infections which are considered to be 'AIDS-defining' are listed in the CDC classification described later in this chapter. HIV HIV stands for: Human Immunodeficiency Virus. It was originally isolated in Paris in May 1983 by Luc Montagnier. It belongs to a group of viruses called retroviruses identified by Robert Gallo in the USA in the 1970s. Retroviruses are unusual in that they copy their genetic material onto the genetic material of the person's own cells. This means that infected cells stay infected for the rest of their lives. Through mechanisms which are still not fully understood, HIV prevents the immune system from working properly. Normally, the body's immune system would fight off infection. HIV is able to infect key cells (called CD4 cells) which coordinate the immune system's fight against infection. A few are actually destroyed by being infected; others, including CD4 cells which are not themselves infected, no longer work properly. The life cycle of HIV is discussed in detail in Immunity and Disease. AIDS & HIV 1 [Page 2](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/8?q1=directories) HIV and the causes of AIDS It has generally been accepted throughout the scientific community for a number of years now that infection with HIV is the necessary precondition for the development of AIDS. It is evidently possible for an individual's immune system to be compromised in other ways, and in rare cases this can lead to the same kinds of infection seen in AIDS. This has been termed Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia or ICL. See the last section in this chapter for a discussion of this condition. Although it is clear that HIV has a central role in the development of AIDS it is not clear exactly what this role is. The human immune system is immensely complex and there are many ways in which it can be affected by a retrovirus such as HIV. Furthermore it is also not clear what role (if any) other factors - known as co-factors - may play in the development of immune damage. See Immunity and disease for a full discussion of these issues. HIV transmission HIV is present in the blood (including menstrual blood), semen and vaginal fluids of infected people, but can only be passed on to another person if those fluids get into his/her body. Although sophisticated laboratory techniques are able to isolate the virus from other body fluids of infected people, such as saliva, the level of virus in these fluids is far too low to be infectious. Thus, the main ways in which HIV is transmitted are: * Through unprotected anal or vaginal sex. HIV is unable to pass through good quality condoms, such as those bearing the British Standard kitemark. * Through blood to blood contact. This mainly happens through the sharing of injecting equipment amongst injecting drug users. In the past, before screening was introduced, this also occurred through blood transfusions or from infected blood products such as the Factor VIII used to treat haemophilia. Very rarely it can happen through occupational accidents amongst healthcare workers, such as needle-stick injuries. Fortunately, follow-up studies have shown that very much fewer than 1% of individuals who receive injuries with HIV-contaminated needles become infected. * Vertically, from mother to baby during the course of pregnancy, birth or breast-feeding. The average risk of transmission during pregnancy is in the region of 10-15% if the mother is HIV positive, although it may be higher if she has symptomatic HIV disease. Breast-feeding does carry a risk of transmission, and should be avoided in countries where good alternatives to the mother's milk are available. Detailed discussion of the modes of transmission of HIV can be found in the AIDS Reference Manual. The detection of HIV Usually HIV infection is detected by an HIV antibody test. The first test to be done, usually on blood, but possibly on saliva, is an ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay). Since this test can sometimes be positive even when someone is not infected - a 'false positive' - a second test called the Western Blot is done. This can confirm an ELISA. The amount of time between getting HIV infection and developing antibodies varies very widely. The vast majority of people with HIV will produce antibodies by around 45 days after infection. However, in a small proportion it may take up to six months for antibodies to develop, and in a very few people with HIV infection it may take even longer. This is one reason why a lack of HIV antibodies does not always mean freedom from infection. It is important to bear in mind that the HIV antibody test is not an 'AIDS test': there is no such thing. It is simply a test for one of the results of HIV infection. For instance, the fact that you can find antibodies to HIV in saliva does NOT mean that you can find virus there in any quantity. There are also a number of laboratory tests which can look for the virus or parts of the virus itself (antigen testing and PCR, Polymerase Chain Reaction, testing), or damage to the immune system, or other aspects of the body's response to the effects of the virus. These should not be confused with the HIV antibody test. An 'antigen' is a part of a virus that stimulates the production of antibodies. Someone who is antibody negative but antigen positive has the virus but has not yet produced antibodies. For further information about HIV antibody testing see the AIDS Reference Manual. The effects of HIV infection Becoming HIV antibody positive Most people who become infected with HIV do not notice that they have been infected. Some have a short illness soon after they become infected. This is called 'seroconversion illness' because it coincides with the time that blood tests for antibodies to HIV become positive. The illness may take the form of a sore throat, a fever or a rash, or rarely more severe illness. Asymptomatic HIV infection Initially any damage caused by HIV has no outward effect. This is called asymptomatic infection, which may last for many months or years. Sometimes people with asymptomatic HIV infection may have swollen lymph nodes, which is called PGL, Persistent Generalised Lymphadenopathy. But this is not a sign of damage in itself. People who have HIV and feel 100% well may nevertheless have signs of immune damage detectable in laboratory tests on their blood. These are called surrogate markers and are discussed in Immunity and Disease. 2 AIDS & HIV [Page 3](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/9?q1=directories) Symptomatic HIV Infection Statistical studies of people with HIV have shown that the more time passes, the more likely it is that the damage will become more severe and infections or tumours may develop. However such statistics reflect population tendencies: any individual will have their own characteristic response to HIV which may or may not lead to symptomatic disease. The infections are called opportunistic infections because they are infections with pathogens that are around us all the time - and which normally our immune systems can fight off with no problems. They only become a problem if the immune system isn't working well and, as a result, infections that were previously completely under control become reactivated. Our bodies also contain cells that are going out of control at any given moment. Normally, these too are kept under control by our immune system. If, however, our immune system is damaged, these cells can cause opportunistic tumours or sometimes cancer. In addition HIV can have direct effects upon the body. For instance, the virus can also attack immune cells in the brain. These cells are involved in feeding the brain cells. If they are damaged, the brain, or some nerves, may not work as well as usual. This is called HIV encephalopathy. When someone starts getting ill because of these infections or tumours, they are said to have symptomatic HIV infection. It is important to understand that apart from the so-called 'wasting syndrome' and HIV encephalopathy, the symptoms of AIDS and of symptomatic HIV disease are the symptoms of particular conditions caused by opportunistic infections and tumours, and not directly by HIV itself. Therefore there is a wide range of possible symptoms and it serves no particular function to answer the question: what are the symptoms of AIDS? Particular symptoms are associated with particular opportunistic infections. An AIDS diagnosis Before coming to a diagnosis of AIDS, doctors look at a variety of symptoms and tests. There is no single test for AIDS. What a doctor would be looking for would be one of the opportunistic infections or cancers in the presence of underlying immune deficiency. They might, for instance do tests to try to seek a positive diagnosis of PCP. These tests are normally only available if you've already been diagnosed as HIV antibody positive, or sometimes if you're seriously ill. The need for definitions In reality, not all 'AIDS defining' disorders have the same prognosis, or outlook. For example, a gay man with a single lesion of Kaposi's sarcoma has AIDS, but has a better outlook than a gay man with PCP, another common AIDS-defining disorder. Age, race, gender and lifestyle factors can also mean that people who have the same rigidly defined HIV illnesses may have very different prospects. Nevertheless, rigid definitions can be very useful in some circumstances. For example in clinical and epidemiological studies, when large populations of people are being observed, it is essential to have well defined 'end points' which mark the transition from one state of health to another. This is the only way that scientific principles can be observed and the studies can reach firm, reliable conclusions. It is also appropriate that these definitions change from time to time, as the epidemic evolves and we find out more. However, definitions of HIV and AIDS as they have evolved have come to suggest that HIV infection is an inevitable, one-way process. In other words, they imply that everyone with HIV will initially be well, then they will get abnormal tests a little while before they get mild illness, and finally there will be a severe terminal illness. This has been the pattern for many people, but others have had very different experiences. For example, people can get infections that would be diagnostic of AIDS and then become healthy again for a long while. This may be because their immune systems were damaged by a combination of HIV and another, temporary co-factor which went away (for example, stress or another infection). Furthermore, many people with HIV infection have never experienced any symptomatic disease even after many years. The impact of improved treatment The development of new and improved treatments both for the underlying HIV infection and the opportunistic infections has significantly altered the natural history of HIV and AIDS. Early estimates of the proportion of people with HIV who will go on to develop AIDS were partly based on the experience of the epidemic in the years before such drugs became widely available. As new drugs against HIV and opportunistic infections gradually become available, these too have an impact on estimates of the average prognosis of people with HIV. The scientific model of disease progression remains a qualified version of the original, but it is vital to distinguish this model, used for epidemiology and statistical purposes, from the prognosis for any individual. It should be remembered that such statistics can never predict the likely outlook for an individual, but instead provide outlines of general trends. Improving treatments for opportunistic treatments means that it is increasingly possible for someone to develop an AIDS-defining illness, such as PCP, and have it successfully treated. Thereafter they may be to all intents and purposes just as healthy as they were before developing PCP, but nevertheless they will now have been diagnosed as having AIDS. In practice, this means that very many people who meet rigid AIDS definitions can continue to lead healthy lives for long periods. Prophylaxis, to prevent infections recurring or happening even a first time, has also changed the natural history of HIV disease. A number of studies show that since the late 1980s people with HIV have tended to have a shorter AIDS & HIV 3 [Page 4](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/10?q1=directories) survival time after they develop AIDS than previously. The reason for this is that prophylactic drugs have delayed the onset of AIDS, so that people are receiving their AIDS diagnosis when their CD4 cell count falls to, say, 75, when earlier in the epidemic they might have developed an AIDS-defining illness at a CD4 count of nearer 200. People with HIV who use prophylaxis are living healthily with HIV, and without an AIDS diagnosis, for longer. HIV disease and ARC People with HIV may develop certain signs and symptoms which are not included in the list of opportunistic infections which constitute AIDS. These forms of symptomatic HIV disease have historically been described as AIDS-related complex (ARC). In the past, anyone who was not diagnosed with AIDS itself, but who was ill and had some of the underlying immune deficiency was put in the category of ARC. Since the development of the HIV antibody test, and the realisation of more and more clinical manifestations of HIV disease, the category of ARC has become extremely vague indeed. For this reason, along with all the other reasons discussed above, many doctors now prefer to think of 'HIV disease' or 'HIV infection and disease'. This approach sees HIV and the symptoms and opportunistic infections that can result as a result of HIV infection as a spectrum of problems, without well defined phases; people with HIV disease may therefore have dramatically different experiences of the condition, including the entirely asymptomatic person, the person who occasionally has symptoms of varying severity but also long periods of good health, and the person who may be quite sick. This approach also helps break down some of the perceived divisions between people with HIV disease. Historically, self-help groups divided along the lines of the rigid categorisations: Body Positive, while providing services to all people with HIV regardless of whether they had been diagnosed with asymptomatic infection, ARC or AIDS, became widely perceived as an organisation mainly for healthy people with HIV, while Frontliners (now closed) was an organisation solely for people with AIDS. While the experience of symptomatic disease is no doubt different from that of entirely asymptomatic HIV infection, ultimately the interests of all people with HIV disease are related. Rather than just considering that their patient has the particular infection or tumour, doctors increasingly consider them as a whole person. A person's work, age, situation at home, and history of previous illness are taken into account before any advice about outlook or therapy is given. A short medical history of the epidemic First signs In 1981 doctors in the USA began to notice a series of unusual infections in gay men in San Francisco, New York, and other big cities. These infections had previously been extremely rare except amongst people whose immune systems had been seriously weakened in some way. The most life-threatening seemed to be Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS). But a whole range of other severe protozoal, fungal, bacterial and viral infections and tumours had also been detected amongst gay men in these cities. In addition, doctors had begun to find persistently swollen lymph glands (PGL - Persistent Generalised Lymphadenopathy) in otherwise perfectly healthy gay men. The majority of these men stayed healthy for months or years after diagnosis. But some went on quickly to develop the infections mentioned above. By late 1981 researchers were beginning to link these 'opportunistic infections' to damage to the immune systems of those who were affected. Many of them had significantly altered ratios of different kinds of white blood cell (or lymphocyte). The ratio of particular CD4 cells (also known as 'T-helper cells') to CD8 cells (or cytotoxic cells) was out of balance. And this balance is an essential component of one part of the immune system that helps the healthy body fight off infection. Early theories In 1982 the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) in the USA acknowledged that there was an epidemic and formally defined the 'Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome' (AIDS). The number of people who developed AIDS seemed to be doubling every 6 months in the USA and AIDS was soon found in every part of the country. Early explanations broke into two main camps, single agent theories and 'immune overload' theories. Single agent It was observed very early in the epidemic that the gay men who were developing AIDS tended to have had many more sexual partners than gay men who were as yet healthy. It had already been established that, at a time when the idea 4 AIDS & HIV [Page 5](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/11?q1=directories) of safer sex had not yet been devised, the number of sexual partners was the main risk factor for sexually transmitted diseases such as Hepatitis B. It was therefore logical to believe that AIDS was caused by an agent that could be sexually transmitted. This theory was reinforced in the years before HIV was isolated by the occurrence of AIDS in injecting drug users and recipients of blood products donated by gay men, mimicking the transmission patterns of hepatitis B. Early theories proposed viruses such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), African Swine Fever Virus, and Epstein-Barr Virus and then ruled them out, instead considering that a new agent was responsible. Immune overload Particular lifestyle factors were blamed for damaging the immune system: use of poppers (amyl or butyl nitrite) or other recreational drugs, number of sexual partners, a preference for 'receptive anal intercourse' (getting fucked), a history of various sexually transmitted diseases, or a combination of all these in the notion of 'fast lane living' (i.e. too much of everything). With hindsight, it is possible to recognise that some of these factors, such as the number of sexual partners and getting fucked, were implicated because they also increased the likelihood of infection with a sexually transmitted agent. The identification of HIV The vast majority of researchers now accept that AIDS is caused by a virus which was identified in France in 1983 and the USA in 1984. This was called either LAV (Lymphadenopathy Virus) or HTLV-IIl (Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III). Since 1986 it has generally been referred to as HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). In 1984 a test for detecting antibodies to HIV was developed and this revealed that only a relatively small proportion of people with HIV had gone on to develop AIDS; AIDS was simply one end of a spectrum of different effects of HIV infection ranging from staying well through to life-threatening opportunistic illnesses. In 1986 HIV-2 was discovered, and some researchers are claiming there may be other different strains of the virus. Fortunately these all appear to behave in much the same way, so that this need not change our advice about transmission, prevention, safer sex and hygiene. HIV-2 has not been as much studied as HIV-1. But it seems that it causes less severe immune damage than HIV-1 in the long term, and that people with HIV-2 may on average stay healthy for longer than those with HIV-1. Searching for origins Given that HIV can be transmitted many years before the appearance of AIDS, it is exceptionally difficult to try to find a source point for the beginning of the epidemic. The biology of the virus suggests that HIV may have been in the human population for anything between 25 and 100 years. So there is simply no clear evidence to suggest any one place where HIV may have come from. And we'll probably never know. The epidemiology is very complex and there are technical problems with testing blood samples which have been frozen for many years. HIV-1 and HIV-2 are just two members of a family of viruses called retroviruses. Other viruses in this group infect: * humans, causing blood and nerve problems (HTLV 1) * cats (FIV) * monkeys (a variety of viruses called SIV - simian immunodeficiency virus - which often does the monkey no harm) * sheep (visna virus causes pneumonia). HIV-1 seems to be closely related to visna whilst HIV-2 seems to be related to SIV from the rhesus monkey. However the human viruses are still substantially different from these animal viruses: it is highly unlikely that HIV originated from a cross infection from animals to humans. Scientific investigation of origins may help us to understand how to combat HIV most effectively. However, it is extremely important to distinguish this from irresponsible speculation about 'where it came from'. In terms of understanding the actual history of HIV, the virulence of the virus, and possible immunity to it, it is worth investigating populations who may have been exposed to HIV for many years, such as those in Africa. It must be remembered that even if we did know the origin of HIV, origin does not equal cause. It is the wilful confusion of origin and cause that has led some people to see the disclosure of HIV infection in Africa in the 1970s as the cause and source of the epidemic. A range of definitions The American AIDS definition is formulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (previously known as the Centres for Disease Control - CDC) in the USA. The CDC definition of AIDS was modified in August 1985 to include specific reference to HIV. It was also revised in 1987 to include a broader range of specific diseases. Since the beginning of 1993 a new CDC definition has been used which means that an HIV-positive person may now be diagnosed as having AIDS if they develop pulmonary tuberculosis, invasive cervical cancer or recurrent bacterial pneumonia, or a CD4 count less than 200. European countries have declared their intention also to incorporate the three new clinical conditions into their AIDS definitions, but they will not be using a CD4 count of 200 as part of the definition. Because a number of clinical trials in the UK still use the pre-1993 CDC definition to define who is eligible to take part, we have kept a summary of that definition alongside a description of the current definition later in this chapter. The World Health Organisation and others developed definitions that are better suited for developing countries with limited access to diagnostic techniques. Similarly, the CDC has a specific definition for AIDS in children. AIDS & HIV 5 [Page 6](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/12?q1=directories) CDC definitions of stages ofHIV infection f )f g ) Changing definitions The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA have constructed a series of case definitions for AIDS. These have evolved over time as the shape of the epidemic changes. The pressures for changes in the definitions come from epidemiologists and clinical trial organisers, as well as officials involved in budgeting and mobilising health care. Although each definition may represent a refinement, they tend to include more individuals, rather than less, and so people suddenly find that overnight they are being categorised as having AIDS, with no real change in their physical status. As it became obvious that children infected with HIV had a different spectrum of problems and because of the difficulty diagnosing HIV infection in children under 15 months old, special paediatric diagnostic criteria were introduced. In 1993 the definition was expanded to recognise three new opportunistic infections, which were becoming more common as the epidemic grew to affect an increasingly diverse range of people. In addition, in the USA anyone with a CD4 count less than 200 is now considered to have AIDS. CDC case definition, 1993 The 1993 CDC classification system for HIV-infected adolescents and adults categorises persons on the basis of clinical conditions associated with HIV infection and CD4 counts. The system is based on three ranges of CD4 counts and three clinical conditions, and is represented by a matrix of nine mutually exclusive categories. This is illustrated in the table on the opposite page. In practice, this means that a person's stage of HIV disease is described by a sub-category consisting of a letter (the clinical category) and a number (the CD4 range). Thus, someone with asymptomatic infection and a CD4 count of 400 would be in category A2, while a person with cervical dysplasia and a CD4 count of 80 would be in category B3. CD4 count categories The three CD4 count categories are: * Category 1: 500 cells/mm3 or more * Category 2: 200 - 499 cells/mm3 * Category 3: Less than 200 cells/mm3 Categorisation should be based on the lowest accurate CD4 count, not necessarily the most recent one. So someone whose CD4 count declined steadily over a period of months until it reached 180, but then rose above 200 again and remained at that level (perhaps as the result of anti-viral treatment), would be placed in category 3, not category 2. Clinical categories The three clinical categories are: Category A Category A consists of one or more of the conditions listed below in an adolescent or adult (13 years or older) with documented HIV infection. Conditions listed in Categories B and C must not have occurred. * Asymptomatic HIV infection * Persistent generalised lymphadenopathy (PGL) * Acute (primary) HIV infection with accompanying illness (sometimes known as seroconversion illness) or history of acute HIV infection Category B Category B consist of symptomatic conditions in an HIV-infected adolescent or adult that are not included among conditions listed in Category C and that meet one of the following criteria: * the conditions are attributed to HIV infection or are indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity, or * the conditions are considered by physicians to have a clinical course or to require management that is complicated by HIV infection This category includes all such symptomatic conditions, with the exception of those placed in Category C. Examples of conditions in this category include, but are not limited to: * bacillary angiomatosis * candidiasis (thrush) in the mouth and/or upper throat * candidiasis of the vagina and/or vulva which is persistent, frequent, or responds poorly to treatment * cervical abnormalites of moderate or severe extent or cervical cancer * constitutional symptoms such as fever (38.5 C) or diarrhoea lasting longer than one month * herpes zoster (shingles) involving at least two distinct episodes or more than one dermatone (skin area) * idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura * listeriosis * oral hairy leukoplakia * pelvic inflammatory disease, particularly if complicated by tubo-ovarian abscess * peripheral neuropathy For classification purposes, Category B conditions take precedence over those in Category A. For example, someone previously treated for oral or persistent vaginal 6 AIDS & HIV [Page 7](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/13?q1=directories) CDC 1993 revised HIV/AIDS classification system CD4 T-cell categories 1. 500 or above 2. 200- 500 3.

Category C Category C includes the following conditions listed in the AIDS surveillance case definition.

RR- 7, December 18 1992. CDC case definition, 1987 Some clinical studies still use the pre-1993 CDC definition of the stages of HIV disease to describe who is eligible to take part in the trial. For this reason, we have retained this summary of these groups, even though they are no longer used for defining disease stages. Group I Acute infection/seroconversion illness. Group II Asymptomatic HIV infection. Group III Persistent generalised lymphadenopathy. Group IV.1 Other disease without laboratory evidence of HIV infection. Within this category, a person may only be diagnosed as having AIDS (as opposed to non-AIDS symptomatic HIV disease) if one or more of of the following diseases is definitively diagnosed, but there must be no evidence of other causes of immunosuppression: Candida in the lasting for more than 1 month; CMV outside the liver, spleen or lymphnodes; Herpes simplex virus causing prolonged skin problems or involving the lungs or oesophagus; Kaposi's sarcoma in a person under 60 years old; Primary (i.e. not involving other parts of the body) brain lymphoma in a person under 60 years old; Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia or pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia (LIP/PLH child younger than Toxoplasmosis of the brain. Group IV.2.A Other disease with laboratory evidence of HIV infection. Regardless of whether any other possible causes of immunodeficiency are present, AIDS is diagnosed if one or more of of the diseases listed above or below are definitely present (e.g. confirmed by histology or culture) Multiple or recurrent bacterial infections in a child younger than 13 (e.g. septicaemia, pneumonia, meningitis, infections causing internal abscesses); Widespread coccidiomycosis; HIV encephalopathy; Widespread 1 month; Kaposi's sarcoma at any age; Primary brain AIDS & HIV 7 [Page 8](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/14?q1=directories) lymphoma at any age; Other specific non-Hodgkin lymphoma; Any disseminated mycobacterial infection other than tuberculosis, e.g. M. xenopi; Tuberculosis involving at least one site outside the lungs; recurrent Salmonella septicaemia; HIV wasting syndrome Group IV.2.B Other disease with laboratory evidence of HIV infection. Regardless of whether any other possible causes of immunodeficiency are present, AIDS is diagnosed if one or more of of the diseases listed above or below are diagnosed presumptively (i.e. not confirmed by histology or culture): Candida pulmonary younger than 13; mycobacterial disease; PCP; Toxoplasmosis of the brain Group IV.3 If laboratory tests are negative for HIV infection, AIDS can only be diagnosed if: all other causes of immunodeficiency listed earlier are ruled out, AND the individual has had either PCP or both an infection listed in section I above AND a CD4 count less than 400. CDC definitions of HIV infection in children, 1987 The CDC classifies children with known or suspected HIV infection into 3 categories, which may be summarised as: * Class PO: high risk exposure/indeterminate infection * Class P1: asymptomatic * Class P2: symptomatic Class PO This includes children less than 15 months old whose mother is HIV positive and whose only positive test result is for HIV antibody. Class P1 This includes symptomatic children aged over 15 months with a positive HIV antibody test and children aged less than 15 months with tests confirming HIV infection. This class is further sub-divided into those with and without laboratory signs of immune abnormalities. Class P2 This includes children with symptomatic HIV infection. HIV infection must be strongly implied and other causes of immunosuppression excluded (as above). Class P2 is sub-divided as follows: Subclass P2A Non-specific signs lasting for more than 3 months: * fever * weight loss or failure to gain weight/height * swollen liver, spleen, lymph nodes or parotid glands * diarrhoea. Subclass P2B Neurological disease: * mental and neurological impairment * failure to develop neurologically or intellectually * certain specific neurological signs * brain shrinkage on CT scan Subclass P2C This subclass includes children with Interstitial Pneumonitis, defined either with a biopsy or X-ray features which fail to improve on antibiotics. Subclass P2D This includes secondary infectious diseases. D1 includes infections outlined in adult classification I (above), except toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex and CMV infections, which can occur congenitally. D2 includes two or more of the following: * Bacterial septicaemia, meningitis, pneumonia, cellulitis, otitis, or oral stomatitis (mouth or widespread herpes simplex * Widespread shingles (herpes zoster) * Toxoplasmosis * Widespread tuberculosis * Widespread brain lymphoma. Subclass P2F Other diseases. This includes other problems that are being linked to HIV, such as thrombocytopenia and certain heart and kidney problems. SAIDS & HIV [Page 9](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/15?q1=directories) WHO definitions of stages ofHIV infection International definitions The CDC definitions above take into account only the experience in the US. These definitions may be less useful in the UK, where some of the 'AIDS-defining diagnoses' are very rare because of the differences in environmental pathogens. They are certainly almost useless in Africa and other less developed areas, where the marked differences in environment result in a completely different clinical picture and the absence of high technology laboratories means that some infections (e.g. CMV, MAI) would be very difficult to diagnose. To try to redress these issues, the World Health Organisation has developed special definitions for adults and children in Africa. Clinical case definitions The following definitions are based on clear clinical markers and do not require any of the diagnostic technology which is likely to be lacking in countries where such resources are limited Adults AIDS in an adult is defined by the existence of at least two major signs and one minor sign in the absence of other known causes of immunosuppression such as cancer or malnutrition. A positive HIV test is not a prerequisite for this. Major signs are defined as: * weight loss of more than 10% * diarrhoea lasting more than 1 month * fever lasting more than 1 month Minor signs are defined as: * candida in the mouth or oesophagus * cough lasting more than one month * widespread itchy rash * recurrent shingles (herpes zoster) * widespread herpes simplex infection lasting more than one month * persistent generalised lymphadenopathy. The diagnoses of Kaposi's sarcoma and cryptococcal meningitis are sufficient in themselves for a diagnosis of AIDS. Children Two major and two minor signs are required in the absence of known causes of immunosuppression. Major signs are defined as: * weight loss or abnormally slow growth * diarrhoea lasting more than 1 month * fever lasting more than 1 month. Minor signs are defined as: * persistent generalised lymphadenopathy * candida in the mouth or oesophagus * cough lasting more than one month * widespread itchy rash * repeated common infection (otitis, sore throat etc) * confirmed maternal HIV infection. The WHO criteria for both children and adults have been criticised by Gilks and Muller as being too insensitive (i.e. they do not pick up all the paediatric cases of AIDS) and too non-specific (they mistakenly diagnose some children as having AIDS).

AIDS & HIV 9 [Page 10](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/16?q1=directories) Walter Reed classification system Walter Reed stages This AIDS definition was developed in 1984, as a system which \"provides a framework for managing patients and understanding the progression of the disease. The system groups patients according to their stage of infection, judged by several indicators of the immune impairment that underlies HIV disease.\" Researchers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center based the definition on CD4 counts. \"As the disease progresses, the patient moves through six stages, the last of which is AIDS. In our system the presence of opportunistic infections is a criterion for the diagnosis of AIDS, but the presence of Kaposi's sarcoma is omitted because the cancer is not caused by immune suppression and can appear early in the course of HIV infection.\" This classification is not widely used, but is sometimes employed in reports of clinical trials. The Walter Reed Army Medical Center is conducting important clinical trials of candidate vaccines, and this classification system may be used in reporting their findings. The system makes use of abnormalities in tests such as delayed hypersensitivity and CD4 count, and the absence or presence of persistent generalised lymphadenopathy (PGL). These only count as criteria if they persist for at least three months. Stage WRO This marks the individual's exposure to HIV. Prior to infection they are HIV antibody/antigen negative and do not have any other signs or symptoms of HIV infection. Their response to skin tests of the immune system (delayed hypersensitivity tests) is normal, and their CD4 is over 400 (a normal count is around 800). Stage WR1 This marks the onset of HIV infection. All the parameters are identical to those in Stage WRO, except that HIV antibody/antigen is now present. Stage WR2 This is characterised by chronic lymphadenopathy (PGL), or swollen lymph nodes. Other parameters are identical to those in Stage WR1. Stage WR3 In this stage, HIV antibody/antigen positive people have normal delayed hypersensitivity tests and no thrush or opportunistic infections; however, they may have developed PGL, and their CD4 count is below 400. Stage WR4 An individual moves into Stage 4 after partial (asymptomatic) defects are found in delayed hypersensitivity tests. Stage WR5 Individuals in this stage have completely lost the ability to respond to delayed hyprsensitivity tests, or have developed thrush in the mouth. Stage WR6 This category corresponds to a diagnosis of AIDS. It is defined by the presence of opportunistic infections other than thrush in the mouth. ICL: AIDS without HIV? Introduction At the Eighth International Conference on AIDS in Amsterdam in 1992, a huge amount of media attention was focused on reports of so-called 'HIV-free AIDS'. The reports were of individuals who had low CD4 counts and in some cases had consequently developed the opportunistic infections to which people with damaged immune systems 10 AIDS & HIV are vulnerable. Although clinically these people appeared to have the symptoms of HIV-related illness, tests showed that they were not infected with HIV. Strictly speaking, a person who does not have HIV infection cannot have AIDS, because HIV is part of the case definition of AIDS. If somebody is immunosuppressed but does not have HIV, they do not have AIDS. Instead this new illness involving immunodeficiency must be seen as a distinct (and possibly a new) medical condition. The [Page 11](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/17?q1=directories) condition has been carry the CD4 protein on their surface (T-helper cells)'. The case reports of ICL have been intensively investigated by researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They have identified 68 possible cases in the United States. Approximately 30 additional cases have been reported around the world. The CDC has drawn up a provisional definition of the syndrome to aid in diagnosis. To be diagnosed with ICL, an individual must have: * a CD4 T-cell count under 300 per microlitre, or less than 20% of lymphocytes. This must be confirmed by at least two tests * negative laboratory tests for HIV (using the HIV antibody test and, if they are performed, the HIV p24 antigen, PCR and viral culture tests) * no other cause of immunodeficiency or therapy known to cause low CD4 T-cell counts The characteristics of ICL Researchers have tried to identify characteristics which are shared by different people with ICL. Dawn Smith and colleagues in the CDC's ICL Task Force interviewed 31 out of 47 people with ICL identified in the USA by August 1992, and 23 of their sexual contacts, household contacts or people who had donated blood to them. Of these, 29 were men and 18 were women. Their age ranged from 1 7 to 78; 39 were white, 4 were Asian, 2 were Hispanic and 2 were black. Eighteen (38% of the people with ICL) had one or more risk factors for HIV infection as defined by the CDC: seven had haemophilia, six had had homosexual sex, six had received blood transfusions and two had heterosexual sex partners who were at risk for HIV infection. All were HIV-negative. Nineteen had developed illnesses which, if they had been HIV-positive, would have qualified them for a diagnosis of AIDS. All but three of the cases had developed some symptoms of immunosuppression. A number of people with ICL have died of complications due to their immunodeficiency. The 23 contacts of people with ICL included 10 sex partners, 3 household contacts, 4 children of people with ICL and 6 people who had donated blood to people with ICL. All of these contacts were perfectly healthy with no clinical or immunological signs of ICL. Researchers performed additional laboratory tests on some of the people with ICL. Separate, extensive retroviral studies on one group of twelve patients and another group of four patients (including tests for HIV antibodies, HIV p24 antigen, viral cultures and PCR tests for HIV-1, HIV-2 and HTLV-I/II) all proved negative. Detailed laboratory tests on the immune systems of one group of five people with ICL and another group of four people with ICL found that there were distinct differences from the immune systems of people with HIV: * Although HIV infection leads to a reduction in the number of CD4 cells, the total number of lymphocytes in the body often remains close to normal. This is because new CD8+ immune cells are produced in response to HIV infection which balance out the loss of CD4 cells. In the people with ICL, CD4 cells were lost and there was no CD8 increase, so the total number of lymphocytes fell. * People with HIV usually have increased levels of antibodies (immunoglobulins) in their blood compared with uninfected people. But the people with ICL had normal or below normal levels of antibodies. * People with HIV tend to have a progressive, steady fall in their CD4 count over time. In the people with ICL, the changes in their CD4 count were unpredictable, and in the long-term ICL may be a more benign condition than HIV infection * In addition to CD4+ T-helper cell depletion, all of the group of four people with ICL also had reduced levels of B cells, or CD8 cells, or natural killer (NK) cells, or all three types. These changes are not seen in people with HIV. Further reports of possible cases of ICL have come from several quite different sources: * no cases of ICL have been seen in the large American cohort studies of gay men such as the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and cohorts in San Francisco, Denver and Chicago. However, 14 out of 4018 transfusion recipients (0.4%) who are being followed by the Transfusion Safety Study have repeated low CD4 counts and meet the ICL case definition * of the 965 people in the New Jersey Intravenous Drug User Study, 106 of the men and 74 of the women are persistently HIV-negative. Two out of these 180 people meet the case definition for ICL In summary, then, people with ICL seem to have a medical condition which is quite distinct from that caused by HIV or other human retroviruses such as HTLV-I and HTLV-II. There is also no obvious common factor in terms of race, sex, age, sexual history, geographical location or any other identifiable factor shared by people wit ICL. The cause of ICL No-one yet knows the cause of ICL. However, there are a number of theories. AIDS & HIV [Page 12](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/18?q1=directories) A new virus? Two researchers have found evidence of reverse transcriptase activity in samples taken from two individuals with ICL. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme which is only used by retroviruses such as HIV and the HTLV family of viruses. However, none of the currently known human retroviruses could be found, and tests showed that the patients' immune system changes were significantly different from those seen in people with HIV, HTLV-I or HTLV-II. Does this mean that ICL is caused by an unknown virus? Leading retrovirologists say that more research is needed, but do not seem to be persuaded that a new virus is the cause. Epidemiological evidence strongly suggests that ICL is not caused by an infectious agent. The clustering of cases in certain geographical areas which is typically seen with infectious conditions - and was seen when the earliest cases of AIDS were first reported - has not been seen with ICL. ICL cases have been reported in over 20 states of the USA as well as in other countries. Unusual HIV infection? Some have suggested that people with ICL may be infected with an unusual strain of HIV which is sufficiently different from the strains used to make the HIV antibody and PCR tests that it cannot be identified by those tests. This theory is contradicted by the absence of any firm evidence that people with ICL are infected by a functioning retrovirus. If they were, reverse transcriptase should be detectable. Also, most of the people with ICL do not have any identified risk factors for HIV infection. Other known conditions? The most popular theory at the moment is that different cases of ICL may in fact have different causes, and may not all be examples of one medical condition. Cases of low T-cell counts are undoubtedly more common than previously believed. However, such cases could not have been detected until relatively recently, when the technology to determine a person's CD4 count became widely available. It is still very unlikely that a CD4 cell count would be performed on somebody who is HIV-negative unless they have already developed signs of unexplained immunodeficiency. Low CD4 counts can also be caused by infections other than HIV or the HTLV viruses. These infections include: * hepatitis B virus * adenoviruses (cause of the common cold) * herpesviruses (CMV, zoster) * human herpes virus 6 * measles virus * human papillomavirus (HPV) * fungal infections such as cryptococcus, histoplasmosis * protozoal infections such as leishmaniasis * mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis Low CD4 counts can also be caused by environmental factors and other medical conditions such as: * malnutrition (deficiencies of zinc, vitamin B6 or protein) * drugs such as corticosteroids * congenital immune disorders * autoimmune disorders * proliferative disorders such as thymoma * common variable immunodeficiency (CVI) * pregnancy * old age However, all these possibilities have of course been considered by researchers, and none has yet been found to be a satisfactory explanation of ICL.

These organisms may be of very different sizes and include viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi and worms. Some immune responses are mechanical: coughing and sneezing are physical responses to foreign organisms in our lungs and throats which aim to expel them from our bodies. However most of the immune system relies on a the coordinated responses of billions of cells and smaller structures throughout our bodies. Unlike an organ such as the heart which has a relatively simple single function, the immune system requires all its billions of constituent parts to perform independent functions but also to communicate and work with each other as a whole. The lymphatic system Although we commonly think of the immune system as using blood cells - specifically white blood cells - to operate, this does not principally happen through the bloodstream which circulates red blood cells to feed our bodies. There is a completely independent circulatory system reaching throughout the body through which white blood cells move. This is called the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system circulates a yellow watery fluid around the body which contains the white cells - called lymphocytes because of their importance to this system - and other materials used by the immune system. The fluid drains into special vessels called lymph nodes in which a lot of the communicating between different parts of the immune system takes place. Lymph nodes (or glands) are situated in many places in the body including both sides of the groin and the neck. Swelling at these sites indicates increased activity by the immune system, normally as a result of fighting infection. The lymphatic system also has special organs and tissues of its own which create and develop the white cells and other parts of the system. These include the bone marrow, the thymus gland under the breastbone and the spleen in the abdomen. IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 13 [Page 14](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/20?q1=directories) Cells, antibodies and cytokines The white blood cells are the immune system's principal players. However there are many different types of cell, some of which have very basic roles whilst others play very sophisticated parts. Although the lymphatic system transports cells around the body most of the activity of the cells takes place within body tissue through which they can move to get to infected or wounded tissue. The majority have only a brief life, no longer than several days or weeks, and are constantly being regenerated by the immune system. All these immune cells come from parent (or 'progenitor') cells in the bone marrow. Some cells act directly on invading organisms (called cell-mediated immunity) whereas others act through the production of antibodies (called humoral immunity). Antibodies function by linking on to specific parts of invading organisms called antigens; once this has happened other cells are drawn in to destroy the invader. Cytokines are the immune system's messengers. They are produced by cells in order to instruct other cells to do certain things. This may happen where the sender and receiver of the message are in close proximity, but alternatively messages can be sent long distances within the immune system. In some circumstances cells communicate directly through linking receptors on their surfaces. Non-specific and specific immunity There are two main levels of sophistication at which the immune system works. One set of cell functions are innate to the system and do not change: they attack a range of common micro-organisms which are a constant threat to maintaining good health. They are very effective at this continuous job but are unable to respond to unexpected invaders. These functions are called non-specific immunity because they respond to a ubiquitous range of problems and not to specific organisms which are relatively uncommon. The main cells which act within non-specific immunity are phagocytes. These are 'eating cells' which literally swallow unwanted micro-organisms and ensure their destruction. Phagocytes are divided into granulocytes and macrophages. Another key component of non-specific immunity are natural killer (NK) cells. These cells are discussed in more detail below. Specific immunity is so-called because it can cope (to some extent) with uncommon and unexpected organisms and develop specific responses to them. The system learns from experience and builds an ever more sophisticated set of responses to invading organisms. The most important element of specific immunity is the production of immune globulins. Antibodies are immune globulins: these are the key proteins produced by cells to counter antigens. A similar function is also performed by immune globulins which are attached to certain immune cells. These are called receptors and they connect directly with the antigens of attacking microorganisms. There are a range of cells which are important to the functioning of non-specific immunity, particularly the B cells (so-called because they are produced in the bone marrow) and the T cells (so-called because they are produced in the thymus). The function of these cells is discussed below. Phagocytes Phagocytes are the key destroying tools of the immune system. There are two types: granulocytes and macrophages. Granulocytes Granulocytes - or multinucleate cells - are produced in extraordinary quantities by the bone marrow (80 million per minute). These white cells, recognisable under the microscope by the fragmented appearance of their nucleus, only circulate in the blood for a few hours. They then migrate into bodily tissues where they can survive for several days. Three types of granulocytes, with different appearances under the microscope, can be distinguished: basophils, eosinophils and neutrophils. Only the neutrophils, which are the most common, are capable of the phagocytosis or destruction of micro-organisms. Attracted even at some distance by an inflammatory reaction, they migrate towards the injured tissues where they undertake their cleaning activities. Although they are probably not directly affected by HIV, neutrophils are not produced properly when the bone marrow has been damaged by high doses of AZT or other drugs. Eosinophils assist in the destruction of larger parasites, and basophils participate in the inflammatory response. During an infection the bone marrow produces additional granulocytes as required: a bacterial infection demands an increase in the number of neutrophils, whereas the presence of parasites will provoke an increase in the number of eosinophils. Macrophages Macrophages are the other type of phagocytes and are substantially larger than granulocytes. They live permanently in body tissues where they can survive for several months or perhaps even several years. They mature from certain other white blood cells, the monocytes, which are also produced in the bone marrow. Like the granulocytes the macrophages participate in the destruction of bacteria. Additionally, macrophages are the only phagocytes able to ingest the largest pathogenic organisms like parasitical protozoans. They are also capable of destroying cancerous cells. Macrophages are themselves infected by HIV and may constitute an important reservoir of the virus, in which it can spread through the body tissues. Lymphocytes Lymphocytes are the other main class of immune cell and are central to specific 'acquired' immunity (although some also contribute to non-specific 'innate' immunity). The human body contains about a million billion lymphocytes disseminated throughout the blood, the spleen, the lymph nodes and other specialist organs like the appendix, the tonsils and the adenoids. Lymphocytes are produced by colonies of identical cells, or clones, which are all descended from the same parent cell. Each lymphocyte clone is 'programmed' to recognise a 14 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE [Page 15](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/21?q1=directories) particular antigen (the proteins or molecules on the surface of invading organisms). It is estimated that about 10 million different lymphocytes are circulating in the blood, potentially ready to respond to 10 million different pathogens. This extraordinary diversity is explained by reshufflings which take place in the genome (or genetic message) of the lymphocyte when it reproduces, causing each lymphocyte to carry particular receptors on its surface, different from one clone to another, and capable of recognising an ever-increasing range of different antigens. B-cells and antibodies One large class of lymphocytes, the B-cells, plays a central role in the body's defences against bacteria. B-cells emit antibodies into the blood. Each B lymphocyte is programmed to recognise a given antigen, and to secrete the antibodies capable of specifically targeting this antigen. The antibodies produced by the B-lymphocytes are of several types, called immunoglobulins G, M, A, D and E. The G-immunoglobulins (IgG), the majority, neutralise bacterial toxins. The IgM, found mainly in the blood and lymph vessels, swiftly target infectious agents. Other antibodies, the IgA, are liberated outside the body, in saliva, bronchial secretions, mother's milk and genito-urinary secretions. The IgDs are present on the surface of the B lymphocytes. Finally, the IgE have an anti-parasitic role and are involved in allergies like asthma and hay fever. Most of the time B lymphocytes are inactive and do not secrete antibodies. They circulate constantly in the blood and the lymph system and cluster temporarily in the lymph nodes, the spleen, the tonsils and the appendix. It is in these organs that they are exposed to pathogenic agents in the body by antigen-presenting cells: when infection occurs cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells identify foreign organisms, absorb them and then present recognisable fragments of these organisms to other cells in the immune system, which produce antibodies or cytotoxic T-cells to search for and destroy these organisms throughout the body. If a lymphocyte comes into contact with an antigen which it recognises, it is immediately activated. It proliferates and sets about secreting antibodies. Each type of antibody is specifically shaped to fit a particular shape of antigen; an antigen can be any specific part of an invading virus or other germ, and is usually a protein or part of a protein. The antibodies bind themselves to the antigens (in a mirror image of the way the virus binds itself to a cell wall). This, in itself, may prevent the virus binding to a cell by blocking its binding mechanism. Thus targeted, the bacteria is rapidly destroyed: the attachment of the antibodies bring about its recognition and digestion by phagocytes. Antibodies can deal with virus that is floating freely in the bloodstream; however, in most viral infections the majority of the pathogen (ie. the virus) is contained hidden away within the host's cells. The antibody-based system cannot fight them here. Only the cell-mediated immune system can destroy virus hidden in the body's own cells by identifying and destroying the body's own infected cells. This is described below. T cells Another large class of lymphocytes, the T-cells, are responsible for cell-mediated immunity (unlike the B cells which use antibodies to do their work, known as 'humoral' immunity). As with the other immune cells, the precursors of the T-cells appear in the bone marrow; but they then migrate to the thymus. It is in this organ, situated above the heart, that the precursors develop into mature T-cells. There are several large classes of T lymphocytes which can be distinguished from each other because they have different surface molecules, or 'markers'. CD8 cells (cytotoxic T cells) One of these classes is made up of cytotoxic T-cells; these play a particularly important role in the anti-viral struggle. These cells carry the CD8 marker on their surface and are able to migrate through bodily tissues. They recognise infected cells which carry viral fragments on their surface, fix onto them and destroy them. The mechanisms by which these killer lymphocytes destroy infected cells are still being researched. They may produce enzymes which damage the target cell or they may activate a suicide mechanism in the target cell. CD8 cells from both HIVinfected and uninfected people have been shown to produce a substance recently named CD8 Antiviral Factor (CAF) which can inhibit the replication of HIV. CD4 (T 'helper') cells A second group, the majority of the total number of T-cells, is called 'helper' T lymphocytes, which have the CD4 marker on their surface. Even though they do not work directly upon infected cells or pathogens, CD4 lymphocytes are nevertheless essential to the proper functioning of the immune system. When activated by an antigen, they set the immune response in motion, activating B-cells which secrete antibodies. They also release stimulating factors (interleukins and interferons) which activate the cytotoxic T cells and the macrophages. These CD4 cells can be directly infected by HIV and their functions impaired or destroyed, as well as being depleted in other indirect ways. The loss of CD4 cells is the key form of damage to the immune system, paralysing normal immune responses and leaving the body prey to opportunistic infections. T lymphocytes recognise foreign antigens when these are presented to them by the antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. These grab hold of or absorb foreign organisms, and then 'display' the constituent parts or antigens of the pathogen on their surface in such a way that T cells can 'learn' to identify them as invaders. See also Surrogate markers below. Cytokines Cytokines are chemical messengers secreted by the cells of the immune system which act to coordinate and control the intricate workings of the immune system. There is evidence to suggest that part of the damage to the immune system in AIDS may be related to the interaction IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 15 [Page 16](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/22?q1=directories) between HIV and cytokines. This can take two forms - HIV can disrupt the normal functions and levels of cytokines, and cytokines can stimulate HIV replication. Moreover, some of the clinical features in HIV/AIDS such as weight loss, persistent fevers and diarrhoea may be due to elevated levels of cytokines. Recognition of self Every individual has a unique molecule, called HLA, on the surface of their cells. Except in the case of identical twins, two humans have only an infinitessimal chance of having the same HLA system. It is this HLA diversity which is responsible for organ transplant rejections. In effect, if cells from one human being are introduced into the body of another, these cells' different HLA molecules are immediately recognised and the cells are destroyed by killer cells (the CD8 cytotoxic T cells). The transplanted tissue is eaten away. These personalised HLA molecules play an important role in the normal functioning of the immune system. When a cell is infected by a virus, it exhibits viral fragments on its surface. These exist alongside the cell's HLA molecules. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8 cells), which destroy infected cells, recognise these two components: viral antigen and host HLA. Similarly, helper T cells (CD4 cells) only recognise pathogens when fragments of them are presented to the T cells on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (in particular the macrophages) in association with the HLA molecules, or more precisely, HLA-DR. The HLA molecules thus play a central role in the immune response to viral infections. Memory In our lifetime we all encounter a number of pathogens to which we develop immunity. This means that the invasion has been successfully contained by the immune response. Another part of this response involves the creation of a small number of memory cells, amongst both the B cells and T cells. These 'remember' the antigens specific to that particular population. Consequently, any subsequent invasion can be dealt with much more quickly by simply reactivating the memories represented within these cells. Vaccines work by exploiting this memory mechanism. A vaccine is basically one or more parts of the virus which has been made chemically harmless. When this is introduced into the host body the same range of immune responses develop against the harmless antigens as would develop against the whole pathogen. As a result, if there is a subsequent exposure to the whole virus, the memory cells of the immune system are already equipped with the pattern of its antigens and so can produce a massive response much more quickly. Boosters work by refreshing this cellular memory from time to time. Cells, viruses and HIV Virology and disease This section describes the manner in which viruses penetrate cells and replicate themselves, with a particular focus on the retroviruses of which HIV has been the most studied. Although the basic science of virology is well understood, this does not mean that we have a clear picture of the development of the disease of AIDS itself. This picture is far from clear and requires consideration of much more than the behaviour of the virus: the intricacy of the immune system and its different responses to attacking organisms makes up the detail of this picture. Nonetheless much of AIDS research has been pursued with a virological perspective and the lifecycle of HIV as described below has been used as the principal template for thinking about treatment responses. Antiviral drugs have dominated pharmaceutical output. The next section on Disease progression and non-progression examines the specific issues of what makes disease happen, and examines the different insights of virological and immunological research. Cells Plants, animals and human beings are made up of microscopic units called cells. Very primitive or simple organisms, like an amoeba, consist of only a single cell. But larger plants, animals and human beings are made up of many billions of different cells. Thus different kinds of specialised cells make up our eyes, our lungs, our heart, our skin, etc. However, all cells share a basic underlying structure. Each cell has a cell wall, or membrane, which encapsulates the protoplasm that makes up the bulk of the cell. Throughout the protoplasm there are particular cellular structures, which contain a variety of molecules. Many of these are 16 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE [Page 17](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/23?q1=directories) long chains of atoms which have a complex and particular three-dimensional shape and structure. This complexity allows them to carry out very sophisticated and specific tasks in the growth and the survival of the cell, both in itself and also in its interaction with other cells. Because cells are very complex systems in themselves, there are many places where drugs can affect them. The growth and routine functioning of cells is controlled by the organism's genetic material. The genetic material is contained within giant molecules of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) which make up chromosomes inside a central core, called the nucleus, of the cell. A useful analogy is to think of there being a kind of genetic 'message' coded into the chemical structure of DNA. DNA has a double helix structure, rather like a very, very long rope ladder that is then twisted round and round to form a long spiral. This means that parts of it can be 'unzipped' and used as a template to create smaller RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules. When a cell wants to act upon or 'read' its message it translates it from the DNA in the nucleus into RNA which circulates in the cell as a whole. Thus various RNA molecules act as messengers (mRNA) and control the production of proteins and enzymes in cell growth and development. Each strand of DNA is divided into a number of different areas along its length called genes. Genes ultimately control particular characteristics of the development of the organism. Thus a particular gene will dictate whether someone has fair or dark hair. The genetic message of DNA is in a chemical language made up of an alphabet of just four letters: four molecules called nucleotides. In DNA these consist of two pyrimidines: thymine and cytosine; and two purines, adenine and guanine (additionally there is another pyrimidine which only occurs in RNA: uracil). Before being taken up into DNA or RNA these molecules go through a process called phosphorylation which prepares them for incorporation and use. Prior to this happening these non-phosphorylated nucleotides are known as nucleosides and the compounds are then called thymidine, cytidine, adenosine, guanosine and uridine. Each of these can only pair up with one of the others, adenine with guanine and cytosine with thymine. And these pairs form the rungs of the spiral ladder structure of DNA. However, the endless different possible combinations of many millions of these rungs has allowed a very complex 'grammar' to evolve. Sexual reproduction brings two sets of genetic messages together and combines into one cell the particular genetic message from which the organism will henceforth develop. From then on the organism grows through non-sexual replication. When conditions are right for cell replication, the DNA in the nucleus is completely unzipped into two separate strands. Each of these two halves of the DNA is then reconstituted by enzymes which add the matching nucleosides. Once there are two sets of identical DNA they migrate to opposite ends of the cell and a new cell wall is built between them until finally there are two separate versions of the original cell. This is the basic process of mitosis which determines the growth and regeneration of all organisms throughout their lifetimes. The reproduction of cells is happening all the time in living organisms, and not just during periods of intense growth. It has been estimated that all the cells in the human body get completely replaced by new cells, produced through mitosis, every three years or so. Viruses Viruses are the simplest form of life. They are microscopically small and made up of just a few different parts. Viruses, like cells, are bags made of a mixture of fats, sugars and proteins which contain genetic material and enzymes. Basically, the functional structure of a virus consists of three parts: * The viral 'coat' or envelope made up of proteins and complex sugars. * The core proteins and enzymes which are used in the production of new virus. * The genetic material which contains the 'genetic message' which determines how the virus will reproduce itself. The rest of this section is an attempt to give a simple description of how viruses work. In order to keep this description simple phrases such as: 'the virus aims to...' or 'the virus has a way of...' are used. It is important to bear in mind, however, that this is only a convenient way of talking. The mechanisms of viruses are not the result of planning, desire or thinking. The mechanisms of viruses develop through evolution: genetic mutation and natural selection. From a biological viewpoint the sole aim of any virus (like any other form of life) is to reproduce its genetic message. However, unlike most other forms of life, a virus cannot grow independently but can only reproduce itself inside the cells of other living organisms. As such, each different kind of virus is like an uninvited guest which needs to live inside a particular 'host', which can be a plant, an animal or a human being. Although a virus can survive outside its host it can only do so in a dormant (or resting) state and cannot grow or reproduce outside its host. The genetic material of HIV is about 100,000 times smaller than that of a typical human cell, for instance. Each different species (or type) of virus has particular host species that it can infect. Although some viruses can infect different species, most are specific to one particular host species. (This is why it has been difficult to develop animal models for HIV). Each virus has different specific ways of getting inside the body of its host. It could be carried in blood, in sexual fluids, through drinking water, in contaminated food, in an aerosol of tiny droplets produced by sneezing, etc. Although viruses can mutate by changing the shape or structure of their outer coat and thus become more or less infectious as a consequence, it is very, very unlikely for a virus to mutate in such a way as to change the way it infects its hosts. Thus, for instance, the common cold viruses are spread through sneezing and HIV spreads through blood and sexual fluids - these modes of transmission are not likely to change. IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 17 [Page 18](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/24?q1=directories) Once inside the body of the host, the virus 'binds' onto the wall of a host cell. It can do this because the coat of the virus has proteins which are shaped to fit and lock onto particular proteins on the cell wall. This is often described as similar to the way in which a particular key fits a particular lock. This binding mechanism for entering the cell is both the virus's strength and its potential weakness. The simplicity of the system is a potential weakness of the virus because the immune system of the host can develop immunity to the virus, by producing antibodies, which act as 'fake locks' for the virus to fit onto. If the host produces enough antibodies quickly enough then all the virus gets locked up to the antibodies and there is no virus left over to infect host cells. The combined antibody and virus particles are then 'mopped up' and destroyed by cells called macrophages. However, the simplicity of the system is also a potential strength of the virus. A small percentage of all reproduction leads to mutations, where there is a kind of 'mistake' in the copying of the genetic message. Throughout life the vast majority of mutations are unviable and lead to a biological dead end. However, the simpler the organism the more likely it is that a particular mutation will be a viable one. Thus the simplicity of the viral structure allows new slightly different strains of virus to develop more rapidly. These new strains may have a slightly different shape which does not affect their ability to infect cells but which will not necessarily be recognised by the body's defensive antibodies. Once the virus has locked onto the host cell it can start to enter the cell. Fats in the surface of the virus start to mix with fats on the surface of the cell. The surfaces of both become fused and the inner contents of the virus, genetic material and enzymes, enter the cell. Inside the cell the virus 'smuggles' the viral genetic material (called the provirus) into the nucleus of the host cell. Once there, the provirus cannot be removed during the lifetime of the cell. The virus may then remain latent for a period before it is activated by some cellular event. This activation may occur almost immediately or after many years, depending on the nature of the virus and its host. Only some cells become activated in this way. When the infected cell needs to read its own genetic message the genetic message of the provirus is also read and can override the cell's own message. The viral DNA directs enzymes belonging to the host cell to produce the raw materials for making new virus: viral RNA which carries copies of the viral genetic material, various viral enzymes and other proteins and sugars that make up its structure. These components migrate to the outer wall of the cell, fuse together to become 'virions' and first 'bud' and then break out of the cell altogether. These virions can then circulate inside the body of the host and infect new cells. Because viruses work in this 'subversive' way, where they incorporate their own genetic material alongside the genetic material of the host cells, they pose special problems for medicine. It is unlikely that a virus can be eradicated without also destroying the cells that contain it. Equally it may be difficult to reach latent virus that is hidden inactively within apparently normal host cells. Moreover, because the virus uses the cell's own mechanisms to produce new virus it can be difficult to produce drugs that attack the lifecycle of the virus without also doing serious damage to the human cells as well. This is why, in general, anti-viral drugs are harder to develop than antibiotics or anti-fungals. In evolutionary terms it is not in the interests of a virus to kill off its host before it has been transmitted to at least one new host. Controlled growth in a long-lived organism such as a human being is likely to provide a well-adapted virus with many years of reproduction; whereas a virus that kills off its host very quickly is likely to die out itself after a number of generations of its host have died. This is why medical history gives us many examples of viral infections which become less severe or virulent as time goes by. Every adult, for instance, carries about a large number of different viruses which do little or no harm. Virus strains that are highly virulent may essentially kill themselves off if they lead to the death of their host before they have been passed on to a new host. The likelihood of their survival thus depends on two factors: their virulence and their transmissibility. It is possible that HIV has existed for centuries in some populations or societies in a less virulent form, causing little noticeable illness or disease. In this setting, highly virulent strains will have died with their host. But as social conditions have changed to favour the wider transmission of HIV due to changing sexual mores, the growth of injecting drug use, the use of blood products and transfusions, international travel and so on, the likelihood of virulent strains being transmitted to another host is increased, allowing those strains to become more common and for illness and death caused by them to become a major problem. Retroviruses HIV (the Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a member of a family of viruses called retroviruses. Science only has a limited experience of these. The first human retrovirus, HTLV-1 (Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1) was only isolated by Dr Robert Gallo as recently as 1980. What distinguishes retroviruses from other viruses is that retroviruses have their genetic message stored in a molecule called RNA (Ribonucleic Acid). Humans (and most other forms of life including other viruses) have their genetic messages stored in a slightly different molecule, called DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid). Because the genetic message of retroviruses is contained in RNA there is an extra step in their lifecycle. Most viruses simply incorporate their existing DNA into the nucleus of the host cell. Retroviruses including HIV convert their RNA into DNA first and then incorporate this viral DNA into the host cell's own DNA. This is important for two reasons. On the one hand it makes the retrovirus harder to eradicate. On the other hand it provides a particular point of attack specific to the lifecycle of this particular group of viruses, namely the enzyme reverse transciptase which is responsible for this conversion of viral RNA into viral DNA. Another important characteristic of retroviruses is that they mutate quite rapidly. The viral enzymes used to make viral RNA lack the error-correcting mechanisms of human 18 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE [Page 19](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/25?q1=directories) enzymes which make mutations much less common in human cells. Thus HIV is capable of slightly changing the proteins on its surface even within the course of one infection in one individual. Strains isolated from different people may have very different surface proteins. These proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids. A small change in one of these amino acids may not impair the functioning of the virus at all but may make it unrecognisable to the body's immune system. All this may mean that a vaccine developed using the genetic material from one strain will not necessarily be helpful in producing a vaccine to protect from another. The aim of vaccine development is therefore to find surface proteins that are conserved on different strains. Although not impossible, this is a more difficult task. HIV and CD4 cells A molecule on the outside of HIV called gpl 20 can bind tightly onto a molecule, called CD4, in the wall of some particular kinds of human cells, gpl 20 is a glycoprotein: a large protein containing various complex sugars in it. It is distributed all over the outer coat or envelope of the virus. CD4 was originally identified as a receptor on T4 cells (or helper cells) that were infected by HIV. These T-cells are the main kind of cell which is depleted from the body in the course of HIV disease. It is now known that there are also CD4 receptors on a range of other cells, including macrophages, some B cells and some brain cells. Macrophages which are infected with HIV can survive for long periods and continue to move around the body, spreading HIV to organs like the brain. There are other ways that HIV can enter cells, but the binding of gpl 20 to CD4 is the main way in which it infects the key cells, CD4 lymphocytes and macrophages. Consequently much research has focussed upon ways of preventing the gpl 20/CD4 binding. The search is now under way to identify another receptor for some cells (such as gut cells or brain cells) which do not possess the CD4 receptor but are still infected by HIV. This binding mechanism presents possible points of intervention to try to prevent the infection of new cells. Once HIV has bound onto the CD4 molecule it uses a second molecule, called gp41, to break through and inject its core into the inside of the cell. The next step is for an enzyme to uncoat it and allow its core RNA and enzymes to mingle with the contents of the human cell. A possible source of future intervention might be agents that could neutralise gp41 and prevent the bound-on virus from actually entering the cell, or agents that could disrupt the uncoating process. Reverse transcriptase Once HIV has got inside the cell, its next task is to mingle its genetic message with the genetic message of the host cell. As mentioned above, HIV and the other retroviruses are special because they contain their genetic message in RNA rather than DNA, and in order to mix their message with that of the cell they have to translate it from RNA into DNA first. This is the opposite of what normally happens in cells: a one-way process where DNA is translated into RNA. Retroviruses are able to convert RNA to DNA because they have a unique enzyme called reverse transcriptase. Because reverse transcriptase is unique to retroviruses, it is a good specific target for drugs. An ideal HIV drug would prevent reverse transcriptase working without affecting any of the cell's own enzymes. One family of drugs, the dideoxynucleoside analogues (usually shortened to nucleoside analogues), which includes AZT, ddC, lamivudine effective against reverse transcriptase. The nucleoside analogues are similar enough to the nucleotides that make up DNA to 'fool' reverse transcriptase into incorporating them but not similar enough to produce working DNA. HIV latency and activation Once HIV has inserted its genetic message it is there for the lifetime of the cell. At this point the HIV can only be cleared from the cell if the cell is killed. HIV's genetic material can remain in an inactive form in infected cell for long periods. This latency, whilst benign in the sense that no direct damage is being done by HIV itself at the time, also makes the complete eradication of the virus from the body much harder to achieve, since such latent virus is likely to remain effectively hidden from the body's immune response even if the infection itself is brought under control. In the past it was believed that most of the HIV in the body remained in this latent stage when someone has asymptomatic infection. But while HIV may be latent in individual cells, it has become increasingly clear that there is no stage when the infection as a whole is latent within the body. Viral replication, the death of infected cells and the infection of new cells is continually taking place during asymptomatic infection, especially within the lymph nodes. It is likely that an infected cell is most commonly killed if it is activated in response to other infections. Because, as described above, CD4 lymphocytes and macrophages exist as parts of the immune system to fight off infection, they have a special cellular mechanism for recognising when infection is taking place and for becoming activated in response to such infection. Activation of CD4 lymphocytes and macrophages involves chemical changes within the cell - such as the production of oxygen radicals - as part of the process of enabling the cell to read its genetic message and thereby make 'weapons' to fight the infection with. At this point, if the genetic message of HIV has been mingled with the cell's own DNA, then the reading of the DNA when the cell is activated will also lead to the reading of the viral DNA. As a result the cell that has been activated against a new infection will inadvertently make many new copies of the RNA of HIV. Another result of finding an infection is that the CD4 lymphocytes and macrophages produce cytokines (or IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 19 [Page 20](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/26?q1=directories) lymphokines) which are chemical signals which activate other cells in the immune response 'team'. TNF (tumour necrosis factor), interleukins and interferons are examples of cytokines. TNF circulating in the blood will activate T lymphocytes and macrophages throughout the body: this will lead to the activation of HIV replication in those lymphocytes and macrophages that are HIV-infected. On the other hand, interferon activates cells but actually has an inhibiting effect on HIV replication. It is possible that HIV may be vulnerable to drug therapy which focuses upon attempts to control this stage of activation. Drugs which may act in a helpful way are known as immunomodulators because they modulate or tune the immune system. The production of oxygen radicals may be blocked by anti-oxidants such as NAC and vitamin C. New virus production Once an HIV-infected cell has been activated, the viral DNA is read. This causes enzymes belonging to the host cell to make new copies of the viral RNA from the viral DNA embedded in the host cell's own DNA. Some of the RNA produced at this stage forms the new genetic material to be assembled into new viruses; some of the RNA directs the production of the other proteins and enzymes required for the assembly of new viruses. It may be possible to design drugs to block the genes and enzymes that regulate this process. The viral RNA starts making new viral proteins, and the whole protein-producing machinery of the cell is diverted to this end. The viral RNA uses some of its own specific enzymes to manufacture viral proteins. The production of viral proteins is a possible target for anti-HIV drugs. One key HIV enzyme is called protease, which the virus uses to break down large proteins into smaller ones from which new viral particles can be assembled. HIV protease is unique to the virus and specific protease inhibitors such as saquinavir have been shown to block the work of viral enzymes and slow down HIV replication in the test tube. The viral components migrate to the surface of the cell as they are formed and attach themselves to the cell wall. There they are assembled at the surface of the cell. New viruses are then formed, which bulge out and then bud off out of the cell wall and go on to infect other cells. At this stage of assembly, some HIV components end up inside the cell, whilst others like gp120 and gp41 end up sticking out of the surface of the HIV-infected cell. In principle it is possible for other cells to recognise that such a cell is infected with HIV. These cells might then destroy the infected cell. Possible therapies would involve stimulating the immune system to be able to do this more effectively. It is likely that the infected cell is killed in the final process of the virus budding off by punctures produced in the cell wall as gp120 receptors on the departing virus pull CD4 receptors away with them. Disease progression and non-progression Pathogenesis Pathogenesis means how a particular disease is caused. Despite the extensive research into AIDS over the last ten years, surprisingly little is known about the precise mechanisms by which HIV infection can result in AIDS. The incomplete nature of our knowledge about the pathogenesis of AIDS does not mean that HIV is not the cause of AIDS. What is unclear is what happens between the moment of infection with HIV and the later onset of AIDS - and why the time period between these events is so variable from person to person. We know that there is an established link betwen HIV and AIDS but also that more light needs to be shed on the mechanisms by which HIV infection can lead to AIDS. A discussion of the reasons why there is an overwhelming expert medical consensus that HIV is the cause can be found in Challenges to the orthodox view at the end of this chapter. It is also unclear to what extent co-factors to HIV contribute to causing disease in people infected with HIV. These are discussed in more detail in the next section. Again, the existence of co-factors to HIV does not mean that the co-factors cause AIDS on their own, in the absence of HIV. Nor does it mean that HIV may not cause AIDS on its own, in the absence of co-factors. It is critically important that the mechanisms of pathogenesis be understood properly. Although successful treatments and vaccines for other diseases have been developed despite incomplete knowledge about their pathogenesis, this kind of uncertainty is likely to mean that research has to rely much more on informed guesswork and speculation rather than hard facts, and may therefore be more likely to pursue fruitless avenues. There is now increasing recognition that it is important for research not only to examine why people get ill but also why people do not get ill despite having been infected by HIV or even why people do not get infected despite having been exposed to the virus. 20 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE [Page 21](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/27?q1=directories) It is clear that the reasons why people do not experience any disease progression are likely to have major implications for our understanding of why disease progression does happen and consequently for our approaches to treatment research. This section examines the lessons of long term survival, i.e. where disease progression does not take place, as well as the many theories of why disease progression does take place. Inevitably, much of the content of this section remains theoretical. Long term survival Since 1992 there has been an upsurge of research into the characteristics of long-term survivors. No conclusions have yet been reached, but it is increasingly clear that genetic factors, characteristics of specific HIV strains and immune system responses may mean that some people with HIV develop immune system damage rapidly while others seem to experience few or no harmful effects over many years. Studies of people who have been infected with HIV for more than ten years but have not developed symptoms, and of people who are uninfected despite almost certainly being exposed to HIV, are providing the basis for a new approach to HIV treatment and vaccines. Researchers are becomingly increasingly interested in understanding these protective processes because they recognise that current approaches to antiviral treatment and therapeutic vaccines are proving relatively unsuccessful. This new research could lead to treatments designed to maintain and restore the initial, apparently strong immune response, rather than to interfere with viral replication directly. Cohort studies A number of studies have now shown that there is a sizeable group of HIV-infected people who have developed no symptoms despite becoming infected at least ten years ago. Researchers are able to follow cohorts of gay men recruited for studies of hepatitis B vaccine in San Francisco, New York and Amsterdam, because stored blood samples dating back to the late 1970s are available. Separate cohorts were recruited from 1982 onwards specifically for studies of the immune systems and health of gay men in San Francisco, Vancouver, London and other large cities. Such large cohorts do not exist for other risk groups such as injecting drug users. In a 1994 review of 539 men in San Francisco known to have become infected in 1983 or earlier, 42 (8%) still had CD4 counts above 500. 31% of men infected for at least ten years had not developed AIDS. In a group of 290 Californian gay men followed for six and half years, around 10% had CD4 counts which were stable for the period of the study, although they were 300-400 lower than the average for HIV-negative gay men. Other laboratory tests suggested that these men were experiencing very slow disease progression, rather than no disease progression. The key issue is to identify what distinguishes the immune response in those patients who do not appear to progress from those who do. Researchers believe that the most important factors which affect the rate of progression are: * the virulence of the infecting virus strain * genetic factors which may make an individual resistant or susceptible to the effects of exposure to HIV * the strength of the cellular immune response and the antibody immune response. Buchbinder SP et al. \"Long-term HIV- 1 infection without immunological progression\". AIDS 8(8): 1179-1182, 1994. Virus strain Some HIV strains seem to be more aggressive than others. A 1994 study of 25 people who were infected with HIV from transfusions and whose 8 corresponding blood donors could be identified found that progression to AIDS and death was significantly slower among people who received blood from donors who themselves did not develop AIDS within years compared with those who received blood from donors with faster disease progression. This implies that the donors with more rapid disease progression had more virulent HIV strains that were transmitted to the recipients. In recent years researchers have distinguished strains of HIV called syncytium-inducing strains (or SI phenotypes) that are much more aggressive than other strains known as non-syncytium inducing strains (or NSI phenotypes). The names refer to the ability of these strains to cause the formation of syncytia (useless clumps of infected and uninfected CD4 cells) in the test-tube. In laboratory tests SI strains mainly infect CD4 cells while NSI strains mainly infect macrophages. In recently infected people, a mix of SI and NSI can be isolated, but it appears that at this stage the immune system rapidly suppresses the SI strains, leaving mainly NSI strains during the asymptomatic period. However, researchers found that when the CD4 cell count reached an average of about 480, fast-replicating SI strains started to reappear, and their appearance was followed by a rise in detectable virus in the bloodstream, and was associated with a much greater risk of CD4 cell count falls and disease progression. Half of the individuals with SI viruses progressed to AIDS within two years, compared with only 8% of those infected only with NSI phenotypes. This might also have implications for treatment, since a Dutch study showed that AZT had significant antiviral effects for people with the NSI strain of HIV; their CD4 count had increased significantly after six months and they developed fewer symptoms. But people who had SI strains showed no benefit from AZT treatment. AZT was also unable to prevent NSI strains from mutating and evolving into the dangerous SI strains. It is unclear whether any other anti-viral drugs are capable of preventing this switch. However, it is possible that SI strains of HIV are not the problem themselves, but may simply reflect the consequence of increasing virus reproduction in the body. The more viruses are replicating, the more likely it is that mutations will lead to the emergence of virulent SI strains. In other words, it may not be the SI strains themselves which force the CD4 cell count down and result in a poor prognosis. Instead, increasing levels of active HIV in the body could be the cause of more rapid disease progression, and the development of SI strains may simply be an insignificant side-effect of the rising amounts of virus in the body. IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 21 [Page 22](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/28?q1=directories) Moreover, recent research has questioned the significance of SI and NSI phentotypes. For example, a study in drug-users presented at the 10th International Conference on AIDS in Yokohama found that people with SI strains were not more likely to progress to AIDS than those with NSI strains.Likewise, a study of thirteen children found no relationship between stage of disease and viral SI/NSI phenotype. Unfortunately, a quick and affordable test which can identify who has SI virus and who still has NSI virus does not exist at present. At present, the only way to identify the virus type requires HIV to be grown in a laboratory for six weeks. Ashton LJ et al.

Genetic differences Every person has genes called alleles which give a specific and individualised signature to human tissues. This signature, known technically as the HLA type, allows the human body to distinguish its own cells from non-self invaders such as viruses, bacteria and incompatible transplants. Researchers are already using tests to identify HLA types to help them identify compatible donors for organ transplants. A study by Dr Dean Mann of the US National Cancer Institute suggested that HIV-positive people who develop symptoms rapidly are more likely to share a common allele. Another specific allele has been identified in people who have a much slower-than-average decline in CD4 count. More research is needed to determine whether HLA typing genuinely can predict disease progression. The effectiveness of a treatment may differ in people with different HLA types, so the analysis of a trial may have to take account of individuals HLA types, as well as their CD4 count and other prognostic markers, if it is to get reliable information on how effective that treatment is at slowing disease progression. See also Genetic vulnerability below. Cellular and antibody immune responses. The immune system has two different types of CD4 (T-helper) cells. TH1 cells produce particular types of chemical signals (called cytokines) which are associated with cellular immunity, such as the activation of CD8 cells. In contrast, TH2 cells produce particular cytokines which are associated with the antibody response. The latest research suggests that a change in the balance of these cytokines takes place as an individual progresses towards symptomatic disease. Some researchers have therefore argued that the balance between TH1 and TH2 responses is a crucial factor in determining progression. Some have suggested that people who have a strong and sustained TH1 response may survive for longer than average, while those with a strong TH2 response may experience faster disease progression. Other researchers warn that no one has yet monitored individual people over time to see if a switch from a TH 1 to a TH2 response coincides with an abrupt decline in CD4 cells. See also CD4 cell differentiation below. Infection of CD4 cells Of the theories as to why HIV causes disease, the direct infection of CD4 cells was the earliest. However there is no longer a consensus as to whether this is the single or even most important mechanism for disease progression. CD4 cells are the T-helper cells of the immune system, which carry the CD4 molecule on their surface. Early studies of people with AIDS revealed that CD4 T-cell counts were significantly lowered. When HIV was identified and found to infect cells via the CD4 receptor, it was initially assumed that HIV was simply infecting CD4 cells and killing them by disrupting the cells' protein manufacturing system or by bursting them apart when new HIV particles bud out from the cell membrane. This is the 'direct cytopathicity' theory. Cytopathicity means the way a virus or poison damages a cell. This theory became - at least temporarily - less acceptable when it became clear that only relatively few CD4 cells in the blood of people with HIV are actually infected with the virus. Furthermore, very few of the infected cells contained virus that was active; in most of them the virus was integrated into the cells' DNA in a stage of complete latency. However, more recent technological advances such as PCR have enabled researchers to detect levels of HIV in the blood up to 10 times higher than previously detectable. Moreover, the vast majority of CD4 cells are not present in the blood at any one time; most are found in the lymph nodes or elsewhere in body tissues, and studies of these tissues have revealed very high levels of infection and high levels of ongoing viral replication even in asymptomatic people with HIV.

Indirect CD4 cell depletion Further research began to investigate how cells that are not themselves infected with HIV can be damaged during infection. This field of research is still very active. Formation of syncytia It is clear that under laboratory conditions a few infected CD4 T cells may gather uninfected T cells around them, forming a clump of cells called a syncytium. All the cells of the syncytium then die, whether they are HIV-infected or uninfected. However, the significance of this phenomenom is unclear: Researchers have had difficulties detecting evidence of syncytia formation in people, as opposed to in in vitro studies. As described above, researchers have distinguished between HIV strains which cause syncytia to form in vitro (called SI, or syncytium-inducing, phenotypes) and those which do not induce syncytia (NSI, or non-syncytium inducing, phentoypes). In some studies the presence of SI strains in an infected person seems to be associated with the onset of HIV-related illness but in other studies this correlation has not been seen. Lange J et al.

Release of gp120 Cells which are infected with HIV and in which HIV is actively replicating are capable of producing excessive amounts of viral proteins which are released into the body. One of the viral proteins released in this way is gpl 20, the viral envelope protein which fits the CD4 receptor, and which is the means by which HIV infects CD4-positive cells. Free gpl 20 may therefore bind onto CD4 cells which are uninfected with HIV. This may have a number of effects. The presence of gpl 20 on the surface of a cell may lead the immune system mistakenly to conclude that the cell is genuinely infected with HIV. In this case the normal immune response may be triggered and the cell may be attacked by antibodies or cytotoxic cells. This phenomenon is appropriately called 'innocent bystander cell killing' and is one reason that we have to be cautious about vaccine preparations based on gpl 20: they may stimulate the kind of immune response that could be damaging if the vaccinated individual is already infected or later becomes infected with HIV. Additionally, the binding of gpl 20 to the CD4 receptor on a cell alone may disrupt the normal functioning of that cell. CD4 molecules are 'signalling molecules', rather like an antenna on the outside of a cell, and if gpl 20 binds on to CD4 it causes abnormal signal reception in the cell. These abnormal signals may prevent the cell from functioning normally (anergy), or may even result in the cell destroying itself through apoptosis, see below. AmadoriA et al.

Apoptosis Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is cell death caused by special types of signalling. Apoptosis happens normally as a way of controlling the immune response. For example, some subgroups of T cells identify proteins in the body's own tissue as being 'foreign', and would attack the host's own tissue if they were allowed to proliferate; the body prevents this by instructing these cells to undergo apoptosis. Apoptosis is also used to weed out cells when there is a shortage of growth hormones or of specific signals from neighbouring cells. Cells commit apoptosis by using an enzyme to chop up their own DNA into fragments, which enables cells undergoing apoptosis to be identified in the laboratory. A number of recent studies have suggested that a significant proportion of the T-cells of HIV-infected people are programmed for apoptosis. This means that when they are activated by exposure to a foreign antigen or by other mechanisms such as cytokines, these cells are destroyed, regardless of whether they are actually infected with HIV. It is not clear how HIV induces apoptosis of CD4 cells. One theory is the binding of HIV's gpl 20 protein onto CD4 cells blocks the cells ability to receive complete signals from antigen-presenting cells. Normally CD4 cells 'see' pieces of foreign proteins and are activated to destroy them when those proteins are presented to the CD4 cells' receptors by antigen-presenting cells (such as macrophages or dendritic cells), which carry the foreign protein lodged into a surface molecule called MHC class II. If this process is interrupted, the CD4 cell may get an incomplete signal and so be primed for apoptosis. Ameisen JC.

Science 257:217-219, 1992. Superantigens Apoptosis might also be provoked by so-called superantigens. These are foreign proteins which are able to activate many more T cells than normal antigens. CD4 cells normally require stimulation at two sites (known as the alpha and beta variable regions) to begin multiplying; the IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 23 [Page 24](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/30?q1=directories) variability of these two sites is one of the means by which the immune system develops the ability to recognise a vast range of antigens. Superantigens can activate CD4 cells by stimulating only one of these sites; thus in people with HIV, a superantigen might induce apoptosis of a wider range of cells which have only one region in common, rather than confining cell death to groups of cells where both regions are identical. It has been shown that retroviruses can produce superantigens which stimulate immune cells to replicate, thus allowing the retrovirus either to infect cells more easily, or to replicate within already-infected cells. Although no superantigen produced by HIV has yet been discovered, some researchers have reported a characteristic sign of superantigen activity in people with AIDS: the deletion of T cells containing specific genes called VB. HIV's ability to mutate rapidly might also give it the ability to produce a new superantigen regularly, thus destroying more and more cells. However, other researchers who have looked for the marker of a superantigen's presence have not found it. Ferre F et al.

Auto-immunity Every living thing has specific markers on its cells which mark them out as 'self'. When foreign organisms enter the body these are recognised by their lack of 'self' markers. Immune cells called memory cells record the details of these invaders for future reference, and the next time they encounter the organism these memory cells trigger a rapid immune response. This results in the cloning of thousands of T-helper cells and antibodies specifically programmed to deal with these unwanted visitors. Auto-immunity occurs when the body attacks its own cells because it fails to recognise them as 'self'. This happens in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, insulin-dependent diabetes and a host of other disorders. Genetic factors appear to play a role in auto-immune disorders, but many of the diseases now known to be auto-immune were not recognised as such until the past ten years. Auto-immune diseases tend to be worse in women than in men, possibly for hormonal reasons. Many viral illnesses display some symptoms which may be caused by an auto-immune response to the viral infection. It has long been suggested that some of the problems seen in AIDS may be auto-immune phenomena. These include eczema, thrombocytopenia (a platelet disorder which results in easy bruising, blood specks under the skin and internal bleeding), psoriasis, vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels), Reiter's syndrome (inflammation of the urethra accompanied by joint pain), forms of arthritis and some neurological problems. Drug allergies may sometimes be connected to auto-immunity too. It has also been noticed that people with AIDS have a much higher proportion of antibodies to their own lymphocytes than healthy people. It is difficult to tell whether these antibodies play any major role in AIDS or why they occur, but some researchers have suggested that they interfere with the ability of CD4 cells to respond to antigens, allowing infections to develop unchecked. Nevertheless, a significant difference of opinion persists between immunologists who think that an auto-immune process is at the root of AIDS and those who think that auto-immune reactions are just one of the immune disturbances caused by HIV. Even those working in the field of auto-immunity admit that it is difficult to distinguish cause from effect where HIV is concerned: is the collapse of the immune system being triggered by an auto-immune process, or is it the gradual erosion of the immune system and the increasing activity of HIV in the body which leads to more and more auto-immune reactions? One leading advocate of auto-immune theories, Professor Angus Dalgleish of St George's Hospital Medical School in London, has suggested that the symptoms of AIDS are remarkably similar to those of chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD). While it is relatively common for the body to attack a transplanted organ because it recognises the tissue as foreign (known as rejecting a transplant), in GVHD the transplant attacks the host body, causing long-term immune dysfunction. This syndrome includes impaired cellular immunity, opportunistic infections, tumours similar to KS, lymphomas, skin and gastrointestinal disorders, elevated levels of cytokines, swollen lymph glands, changes in the CD4 and CD8 ratio and loss of reactivity to specific antigens. These symptoms are similar to those which characterise AIDS. Professor Dalgleish points out that whilst AIDS is seen as a disease of immune suppression, development of AIDS is always preceded by a high level of immune system activation and the degree of immune activation is thought to predict the rate of disease progression. Markers of the activation of immune cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages include beta2-microglobulin, neopterin and endogenous interferon, and studies have shown that increasing levels of these substances in the blood of HIV-positive people are strong predictors of the development of AIDS. These markers may be regularly monitored by doctors treating HIV-positive people. One cause of the immune activation in people with HIV may be the striking resemblance of HIV to 'non-self' human cells. All human cells carry markers called MHC which allow the immune system to distinguish between its own 'self' cells and 'non-self' human cells from other people that may get into the body. Researchers have discovered that the gpl 20 protein on the surface of HIV mimics the marker on the surface of non-self human cells. One auto-immune hypothesis argues that the consequence of this mis-recognition of HIV by the immune system is a gradual but generalised activation which cannot be switched off. This begins very soon after the moment of HIV infection, and although levels of HIV in the blood rapidly decline after seroconversion, by then the damage has already been done. In the early weeks of infection, HIV infects cells with the CD4 marker along with other cells, and these infected cells display the HIV envelope protein gpl 20 on their surface. Other CD4 cells will also pick up fragments of gpl 20 even though they remain uninfected. T-cells and antibodies are produced in an attempt to clear 24 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE [Page 25](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/31?q1=directories) the cells displaying gpl 20, but because the immune system is constantly being activated either by HIV itself or by other foreign organisms, new viruses bearing the disruptive gpl 20 are continually produced, perpetuating the process. Another view, advanced by Professor Geoffrey Hoffman and other immunologists, is that one way in which the immune system damps down potentially explosive antibody production is to manufacture antibodies to those antibodies. However, the problem with these anti-antibodies is that that they match the antigens which triggered the antibodies they have been summoned to control. In other words, anti-antibodies are mirror images of the antigen, and will trigger the same sort of immune response as the antigen would do. In the case of HIV infection, this anti-antibody production means that the immune system might be triggering the production of more 'virus-alikes' - antibodies which are able to bind to CD4 cells and antigen-presenting cells, thus unbalancing the immune system. According to this theory, the use of therapeutic vaccines based on HIV envelope proteins like gpl 20 could paradoxically trigger more immune damage rather than providing protection, because the vaccine might trigger the production of anti-antibodies. The auto-immune theory of AIDS offers an explanation for the varying periods between infection and the development of symptoms which have been observed in HIV-positive people. All forms of auto-immunity have a genetic component and researchers believe that HIV disease is no exception. Everyone has genetic markers called HLA which are an individual tissue 'signature'. When skin grafts are being planned, surgeons will employ tissue-typing (trying to ensure a good similarity between the HLA type found in the transplant recipient and the donor) to reduce the chances of tissue rejection. In HIV-positive people, researchers have discovered that some HLA types are associated with more rapid disease progression; however, most researchers are sceptical over claims that people with HIV can use hospital tissue-typing services to identify for themselves whether or not they are likely to be fast progressors.

CD4 cell differentiation Researchers have recently been able to distinguish between two types of CD4 T-cell, which they have named TH1 and TH2. When a foreign organism infects the body, the first T-cells to respond appear to be TH1 cells. These seem to be mainly important in triggering the production of cytotoxic (cell-killing) T-cells which track down and destroy infected cells, while TH2 cells, whch appear to come into action somewhat later, are largely responsible for stimulating B cells to make antibodies against the foreign protein. The two CD4 cell types can be distinguished by the different cytokines which they rpoduce: TH1 cells produce IL-1 and IFN gamma, while TH2 cells produce IL-4 and IL-10. In HIV infection, it appears that as time passes TH1 cells become fewer, and TH2 cells more common. However, the antibodies stimulated by TH2 cells seem to be much less effective against HIV and HIV-infected cells than the cytotoxic cells stimulated by TH1. People with more TH2 cells than TH1 may be at greater risk of progressing rapidly to AIDS. Moreover, in individuals who seem to have been exposed to HIV yet not infected, no antibodies (stimulated by TH2 cells) could be detected, but IL-2 levels were high, suggesting that a TH1 response might have eliminated the virus. This may also mean that vaccine researchers should concentrate on trying to elicit a cytotoxic T cell response, rather than an antibody response. See also Loss of anti-HIV CD8 cells, below.

TH 1 and TH2 cytokine production in HIV infection. 8th Intl Conf AIDS, Amsterdam, abstract WeA 1047, 1992. Infection of other tissues It may be a mistake to focus solely on how HIV affects T-cells, since HIV-infected people with normal CD4 counts also have subtle immune abnormalities. Recent research has shown that the first (and most easily) infected cells in the body may be immune system sentinels in skin and mucous membranes known as dendritic cells, some of which appear to bear a receptor for the HIV surface protein gpl 20. These cells grab hold of foreign matter, such as HIV, and carry it to the lymph nodes where they present it to immature T-cells and B-cells so that specific immune responses against the antigens develop. Researchers have shown that even very early in the course of HIV infection large amounts of the virus are concentrated in the thread-like tentacles of follicular dendritic cells contained within the germinal centres of the lymph nodes. In and around the germinal centres, CD4 cells become infected in increasingly large numbers. Many of the CD4 cells in this region may become activated, allowing them to be more easily infected. The presence of swollen lymph nodes, known as persistent generalised lymphadenopathy or PGL, is a well-known and common manifestation of early HIV infection. This theory argues that even when little HIV can be detected in the blood circulating around the body, significant quantities of virus are accumulating in the lymph nodes, both in infected cells and as free virus. Ultimately, the lymph node may become overwhelmed and the follicular cells may break down, leading to the release of large quantities of free virus IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 25 [Page 26](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/32?q1=directories) particles into the bloodstream, as becomes detectable in the later stages of HIV disease.

Damage to antigen-presenting cells Antigen-presenting cells - particularly dendritic cells and monocytes - have a key role in the immune response because they are the first cells to recognise invaders and stimulate the rest of the immune system. It has been shown that these cells stop functioning properly from very early in HIV infection, losing their ability to activate T-cells and hence the other components of the immune response. It is not clear why this happens - it may be that infected antigen-presenting cells are unable to produce cytokines normally - but this lack of stimulation to T-cells will eventually mean that the number of T-cells will itself fall.

Cytokine dysregulation A cytokine is a protein produced by a cell in response to any of a variety of stimuli, which then acts upon target cells which carry receptors for that cytokine. They are the immune system's messengers. The cell which produces the cytokine may itself have receptors for that cytokine, in which case so-called autocrine effects are possible. Alternatively the cytokine may work only on other cell types. Cytokines have essential roles in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation during embryo development and in later life, in regulating the immune response to foreign antigens and invading organisms, and in mounting other forms of defence against infection by viruses and other pathogens. Essential processes ranging from wound healing to the development of cellular and humoral immunity all require the participation of a range of cytokines. Many diseases involving disruptions of these processes are associated with altered regulation of cytokine production and action. Knowledge about the roles of cytokines in these situations is starting to open the way to their use as treatments in some diseases. CD4 cells are an important source of many cytokines, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), gamma interferon (IFNg) and colony stimulating factors (CSF), and the destruction of CD4 cells in HIV disease probably explains the reduced levels of these cytokines in people with HIV. IL-2 and the CSFs are both important stimulators of immune functioning (although they may also stimulate increased HIV replication in infected CD4 cells), and IFNg is able to inhibit HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme. In people with AIDS, normal alpha interferon (IFNa) is also reduced; this normally helps fight viral infections. Instead, a different form of IFNa, called acid-labile IFNa, is present, which may contribute to symptoms such as fever and tiredness, shortages of white and red blood cells and platelets, and autoimmune symptoms. AZT reduces levels of acid-labile IFNa. Another cytokine which may be important in the pathogenesis of AIDS is tumour necrosis factor (TNF), levels of which may be unusually high in people with HIV disease. TNF enhances HIV replication, and may be a cause of HIV-related wasting. It also stimulates production of other cytokines such as IL-1, which can activate HIV, and IL-6, which may accelerate the growth of KS cells. Drugs that may reduce levels of TNF are NAC, oxpentifylline and thalidomide. Clemens MJ. Cytokines. Bios Scientific Publishers, London, 1991. Matsuyama T et al. Cytokines and HIV infection: is AIDS a tumor necrosis factor disease? AIDS 5(12): 405-1417, 1991. Genetic vulnerability There is some evidence that one factor that may explain why some people with HIV progress to AIDS quickly, while others progress only very slowly or may never develop AIDS, is the genetic make-up of the individual. A number of researchers have concluded that people with HIV who have particular gene sets (known technically as haplotypes) for a cell surface molecule called HLA-1 may be likely to progress to AIDS faster than people with a different HLA-1 haplotype. It has been argued that the fact that chimpanzees' lymphocytes and monocytes can be infected by HIV both in vitro and in vivo, yet the virus does not cause disease in chimpanzees, indicates the importance of genetic factors.

Loss of anti-HIV CD8 cells CD8 cells, or cytotoxic T cells, are capable of attacking infected cells, either killing them or suppressing the viruses within them. They play a key role in the cellular immune response (as opposed to the humoral immune response, which involves antibodies). Research suggests that CD8 cells may be central to the body's initial strong immune response following infection with HIV, which dramatically reduces the amount of virus that can be detected in the blood. Their importance is also indicated by evidence that people with high levels of CD8 cells may have a better prognosis than people with lower levels. Tests in chimpanzees have suggested that the reason why these animals do not suffer immune damage when inoculated with HIV may be due to their CD8 lymphocytes' ability to inhibit HIV replication. Dr Jay Levy has shown that CD8 cells secrete a previously unknown substance that he has named CD8 antiviral factor, or CAF. CAF is a highly effective inhibitor of HIV replication. Levy has shown that in blood or lymph node 26 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE [Page 27](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/33?q1=directories) samples taken from long-term asymptomatic people, HIV cannot replicate in the presence of only a small number of CD8 cells: only one CD8 cell is needed to suppress virus replication in 20 CD4 cells. CAF is produced at high levels by the CD8 cells of people who are asymptomatic with strong CD8 responses, but little or no CAF is produced by the CD8 cells of people with symptoms. By this stage of the disease, many CD8 cells are needed to inhibit HIV replication in one CD4 cell. CD8 cells from uninfected as well as HIV-positive people secrete substances that can inhibit HIV replication. It is not clear why the CD8 cells lose activity over time. Buchbinder S et al.

HIV: From discovery to uncovering features of pathogenesis and long-term survival. 10th Intl Conf AIDS, Yokohama, presentation TS2, 1994. Escaping the immune response Compared with most other human viruses, HIV is extraordinarily variable. Every time a virus replicates it makes one or two small errors, so its progeny have subtle differences in their genetic make-up. One theory suggests that the immune system is initially able to control HIV infection by producing antibodies and cytotoxic immune cells which suppress viral replication and kill infected cells, but over time so many different variants of HIV occur within an infected person that the immune system is unable to keep pace, allowing the variants to multiply unhindered by the host's immune sytem. Research has suggested that the parts of HIV which might mutate so that they are no longer recognised by the host T cells include parts of the core protein gag, the protein envelope, and the V3 loop of the gpl 20 surface protein. In addition, it appears that in mutating to become invulnerable to neutralising antibodies, HIV may also change so that thereafter it is actually enhanced by the same antibodies. This has alarming implications for therapeutic vaccine research: immunisation with one HIV strain may produce a group of antibodies that could neutralise the immunising strain but enhance a different strain.

Implications for treatment It is unlikely to be possible to treat HIV infection with the efficiency we would like until we understand better precisely how HIV causes illness. However, the more sophisticated understanding of pathogenesis which is slowly emerging already has implications for the treatment of people with HIV. For example, HIV's ability to infect and affect a range of different cells means that it is important to study the effects of anti-HIV drugs in the whole of that range of cells, not just T-cells. To an extent this is now happening; for example, it appears that AZT can improve the ability of antigen-presenting cells to stimulate T-cells. It also has implications for the surrogate markers used to monitor the disease and the effect of anti-HIV treatments: simply measuring CD4 counts may not give a particularly accurate picture of how effective a treatment is. Moreover, because several of the mechanisms reviewed in this chapter involve the immune system fighting itself, treatments that work by stimulating the immune response (for example, some cytokine treatments) may actually be harmful. Immune stimulating treatments have the additional risk of boosting HIV replication within infected cells. Researchers investigating apoptosis found that cycloheximide and cyclosporin A - drugs that suppress the immune system - prevented apoptosis occurring, presumably because they blocked the cell activation that leads to apoptosis (although cyclosporin may also have direct ant-HIV effects). However, few researchers would currently endorse the idea of giving immunosuppressive drugs as treatment in a disease largely characterised as immune deficiency. Drugs which block the interaction of gpl 20 and CD4, such as soluble CD4 and glycosylation inhibitors, may not work because antigen-presenting cells can be infected with HIV independently of CD4.

IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 27 [Page 28](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/34?q1=directories) Co-factors Introduction It is not known exactly why one person with HIV infection develops AIDS, and another doesn't. In addition to factors such as the virulence of the HIV strain, the strength of the immune response to infection and genetic factors within the individual, there may be a number of co-factors - factors that work with or alongside HIV to accelerate its harmful effects. Herpes viruses Herpes viruses can probably activate HIV replication in a number of ways. First, a number of herpes viruses produce proteins which can activate HIV replication within infected cells. However, this has only been shown to occur in individual cells which are infected by both viruses, rather than in all cells of an individual who is infected with both viruses. Human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) naturally infects T-cells, so co-infected HIV/HHV-6 cells could occur in people. However, different researchers have shown that co-infection with HHV-6 and HIV may either increase or decrease HIV replication. Secondly, cells not normally infected by HIV could be made vulnerable to infection by prior infection with a herpes virus. This can occur through a number of different mechanisms. For example, HHV-6 has been shown to make infected cells more likely to express the CD4 molecule on their surface. As CD4 is the receptor for HIV, this would make those cells susceptible to HIV infection. Herpes viruses can also make cells express a receptor on their surface (called the Fc receptor) which binds antibodies; HIV which is coated with antibody may be able to infect cells which express this receptor. Another phenomenom demonstrated in laboratory studies is that when HIV replicates inside cells co-infected with HIV and a herpes virus, the new HIV particles produced may incorporate herpes virus proteins in their envelope. Herpes viruses are able to infect a wider range of cells than HIV normally can: the presence of these herpes virus proteins, however, may allow HIV to infect cells which would otherwise be invulnerable to it. Alternatively, herpes virus infection may cause cells to secrete cytokines into the body which promote HIV replication in HIV-infected cells. This mechanism does not require cells to be co-infected with both HIV and the herpes virus. In 1989 doctors from the Royal Free Hospital in London published evidence from their cohort of people with haemophilia that suggested CMV may act as a co-factor to HIV, speeding up progression to AIDS in individuals who were infected with both viruses. CMV may activate HIV and cause further replication. Additionally, it has also been suggested that CMV may allow HIV to infect cells which do not have CD4 receptors: this would reduce the beneficial activity of drugs that work by blocking CD4 viral binding. However, more recent studies have failed to find any link between CMV and increased risk of progression. In early 1994 the Royal Free team also presented updated figures on their cohort. Men who had CMV as well as HIV tended to be significantly older than those who were HIV-positive but were not also infected with CMV, and older age has been shown by many studies to be associated with faster disease progression. When the analysis was adjusted to take account, of this difference, the Royal Free researchers found that the effect on CMV fell just below the conventional level of statistical significance i.e. it could have been due simply to chance. Several other studies presented at the 10th International Conference on AIDS in Yokohama in 1994 also failed to find any evidence that CMV accelerates HIV disease progression in people with haemophilia and in non-haemophilic people. For more information on these studies of CMV as a co-factor, see the A-Z entry on CMV. Nevertheless, some trials have suggested that drugs that act against herpes viruses such as foscarnet and acyclovir may prolong the survival of people with HIV. A study is underway in London to see whether high dose acyclovir or valaciclovir, which may keep CMV inactive, can slow down HIV disease progression. Another study of high-dose acyclovir was stopped after 48 weeks because although high-dose acyclovir was not reducing the incidence of CMV disease in the acyclovir-treated participants compared with those receiving placebo, the survival of participants receiving acyclovir was significantly higher than that of placebo-recipients.

Diet Some studies have suggested that deficiencies in the amounts of vitamins or minerals in the diet may influence disease progression. A recent study suggested that people who took supplements containing more than 5 times the recommended daily allowance of vitamins B1 and B2 were significantly less likely to have died of AIDS after 8 years follow-up, and a similar effect was seen in people who took at least twice the daily recommended amount of vitamin B6. However, people with very high intakes of zinc and vitamin A were more likely to develop AIDS. The researchers stress that the study does not clearly establish a cause and effect relationship, and that further research is needed.

Other co-factors A number of other potential co-factors have been suggested, but most are based on informed (and sometimes ill-informed) guesswork than hard science, not least because the highly variable course of HIV infection makes it very difficult to single out factors which may be making a difference from those which are merely coincidental or irrelevant. These other proposed co-factors, such as recreational drug use, stress, repeated infection with HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, are discussed in Protecting your health in daily life. Surrogate markers The significance of surrogate markers Laboratory tests can be used to monitor disease progression in populations infected with HIV. As such, they are vital tools for clinical trials seeking to evaluate new therapies against HIV and its damage to the immune system. However, they do not replace the necessity of taking a good clinical history or examination but rather provide back-up information which can be helpful in a number of ways. It is important to understand that there is genuine 'good faith' disagreement between different doctors about what importance to attach to laboratory markers when dealing with an individual. It is important to exercise some caution in the use of surrogate markers. There is not yet an accurate measure of an individual's immune function or impairment other than clinical evidence of opportunistic infection or tumour, i.e. actual illness. But in order to know when to begin prophylaxis against particular opportunistic infections, and so hopefully prevent them from ever happening, surrogate markers are needed. However, unlike clinical markers, surrogate markers indicate an increased possibility of an opportunistic infection developing rather than a firm prediction that one will develop in the immediate future. In other words, it is important to distinguish between the statistical nature of surrogate markers which reveal trends in populations and the individual nature of individuals. Statistical significance is not the same as an individual diagnosis. Thus, some people with low CD4 counts may actually be, in both subjective and clinical terms) more healthy than someone with higher CD4 counts. It is important to stress that a single test result does not necessarily indicate that someone is going to fall ill. For instance, a single low CD4 count, taken out of context, may be misleading. It may be a sign that the body is successfully fighting off an infection (and consequently using its T-cells in such a way that they do not show up free-floating in the blood at that particular time). Similarly, it is well known that T-cell numbers in an individual may fluctuate widely in the course of a single day. Regular monitoring of these surrogate markers cam actually lead to considerable anxiety, especially if there is a belief that a fall in markers means imminent illness. An alternative approach is to place a more positive emphasis on the usefulness of surrogate markers, arguing IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 29 [Page 30](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/36?q1=directories) that this kind of monitoring of the immune system is mtoivated by the underlying benefit of early intervention or prophylaxis. The results of these tests may provide reassurance by demonstrating that disease is unlikely in the near future. There may be no warning clinical signs of severe immune suppression and therefore no other way of knowing when prophylaxis against opportunistic infections (eg PCP) would be worthwhile. As a result your subjective sense of your own health does not tell the whole story and cannot wholly substitute for laboratory testing. As in many other aspects of health, it is likely that a balanced approach tailored to the needs and wellbeing of the individual is required in the importance attached to surrogate markers. The following are tests used in the monitoring of immune function in HIV disease. In the United Kingdom the routine tests performed are: * a lymphocyte subset analysis * sometimes a p24 antigen or antibody test. Other laboratory measures, such as beta2-microglobulin and neopterin, tend not to be used routinely, often just during clinical trials of HIV treatments. Most of the newer virological tests are not used in clinical practice at present. Immunological markers The most common immunological markers studies are lymphocyte subsets. These are calculated from a blood test in which different populations of white cells are stained and either the percentage, or the absolute number, of the total that are of a particular type are measured. CD4 count There are a number of steps in making a CD4 count. First of all, a sample of blood is taken from the individual. The lymphocytes are then separated from the other cells in the blood by a laboratory machine called a haematology instrument. CD4 cells can be counted in several different ways. The total lymphocyte count is the number of lymphocytes in the blood sample and at best provides a rough indication of the state of your immune system. It is useful for very early asymptomatic HIV infection as it is simple and inexpensive. The CD4 percentage is the result from a flow cytometer and will give you the percentage of lymphocyte cells that are CD4 T cells. The absolute or CD4 count is the total number of CD4 cells in a cubic millimetre of blood plasma. In this Directory, we have generally abbreviated this, so instead of saying that someone has a count of 200/mm3 we simply say that they have a count of 200. The absolute CD4 count is calculated from the two measurements described above, taking the total number of lymphocytes in a cubic millimetre of blood, and using the CD4 percentage to work out how many of them are CD4 cells. If a result is substantially different from the previous CD4 counts, the test is usually repeated to make sure that the calculation is correct. Since the CD4 count is worked out from two different measurements it therefore tends to vary more than the CD4 percentage alone. Many studies have shown the CD4 percentage to be the more reliable marker than the CD4 count, although for clinical purposes the two values are closely related. The CD4:CD8 ratio describes the balance between these two types of lymphocytes. It is used very infrequently as it adds very little to the picture provided by CD4 counts. CD4 counts are not a straightforward, unambiguous reflection of the healthiness of the immune system. The counts can vary depending on a number of factors. First, certain biological factors can affect the count. These include: * other illnesses like a cold or flu, herpes infections or CMV * treatment or recreational drugs taken by individuals * circadian (daily) rhythms * different individuals can have slightly different CD4 molecules depending on, for example, their race. This may affect the accuracy of the tests used to measure CD4 counts. CD4 lymphocyte counts can fluctuate quite naturally during the day in response to routine activities such as walking or lying down and may be up to several hundred points different between subsequent samples. A person's count can also vary according to the techniques used to measure it. This has been highlighted by a large quality control program at the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). The study used the same flow cytometers, CD4 antibodies, analytic procedures and sample preparation protocols in all laboratories under investigation. Yet, they still found significant variations in the results over time. They got different results from a single sample, depending on which lab performed the tests. Even when a single lab tested one sample several times, using the same methods each time, they still got significantly variable results - ranging from 202 to 334 cells/mm. In response, there have been a number of recommendations for making CD4 counting as accurate and consistent as possible, such as always taking blood samples at a similar time of day and always using the same lab and procedures. Ultimately, it is important to follow trends rather than individual CD4 counts. A single count is of little value compared with monitoring a series of counts over time. The rate of decline and the overall trend in the CD4 count are the best predictors, since individual CD4 counts can fluctuate quite substantially. For example, if values of CD4 counts continue to fall over three or four tests, this is much more significant than a fall from one test to the next. Unusual or unexpected individual CD4 count results must be interpreted carefully. The absolute CD4 count is the product of several measurements performed on the blood samples. If a result is far from the previous CD4 counts, the test needs repeating. Strategies for the use of CD4 counts vary from doctor to doctor and clinic to clinic. The principle is to measure CD4 counts often enough to anticipate the emergence of opportunistic infections and prevent them with appropriate 30 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE [Page 31](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/37?q1=directories) prophylaxis. Usually, when high, CD4 counts are measured at regular check ups every three months but if the level is lower or dropping rapidly, monthly tests may be suggested by some doctors. Since certain infections only occur when the CD4 level is extremely low, it may be useful to continue testing at all stages of disease. CD4 counts & natural history The CD4 count is currently used to monitor and help doctors understand the progression of HIV infection within an individual, and provides an indication of when to start various prophylaxis and/or treatment drugs. The normal range for a CD4 count is thought to be 600-1400 cells/mm3 or 27-46%. Gay and bisexual men have somewhat lower counts whilst very young children generally have much higher levels. At around the time of initial infection by HIV the CD4 count typically drops, sometimes quite dramatically, especially with people who have a significant 'seroconversion illness' at the time they become infected. The count usually then returns to the normal range. The trend over subsequent years is usually downwards, averaging a drop of 40-60 cells/mm3 per year. Some people experience a rapid loss, while others (including people taking treatments and people taking no treatments) may have stable CD4 counts for many years. It is never inevitable that HIV infection will lead to AIDS. Certain minor symptoms may occur during the early phase of the infection, but these usually only become problematic when the CD4 count drops below 500 cells/mm It is well documented fact that as your CD4 count gets lower you are at a greater risk of developing an AIDS-defining illness. A CD4 count below 200 usually indicates that the immune system is no longer able to protect against numerous serious infections. It is very unusual for people to die of AIDS-related illnesses if their CD4 count is above 50. The experience of drug users is an exception to this rule, for whom life-threatening bacterial infections are quite common even at higher CD4 counts. So far, most statistical data and studies on the natural history of HIV infection have only been performed among (predominantly white) gay men or haemophiliacs. The results of these studies cannot automatically be extended to women and other races or risk groups. For example, one study found that among uninfected drug users, the average CD4 counts in women were higher than those in men. Little is known about such gender and race differences. There is also a severe lack of data showing whether CD4 counts in women correlate with women-specific conditions such as genital tract infections and neoplasms. Even age group is important to consider when comparing progression rates between studies. It is important to remember that statistical trends are worked out from large pools of data, and are tools that only provide an approximation of how a CD4 count is related to the risk of a particular opportunistic infection or death. They do not necessarily predict what will happen to a particular person who has a certain CD4 count. CD4 counts are just one out of several possible markers, and it is likely that the most accurate monitoring of an individual's health will involve the use of more than one marker at a time. Prophylaxis on the basis of CD4 counts Statistical studies of the natural history of HIV disease related to CD4 count have shown that the risk of developing certain opportunistic infections is significantly related to the CD4 count. Many decisions on when to start prophylaxis to try to prevent those infections are therefore based directly on the CD4 count. * At CD4 counts below 500, anti-retroviral therapy (AZT) is licensed, though not necessarily recommended, and should be considered * At CD4 counts below 200, prophylaxis against PCP is recommended. * At CD4 counts below 100, prophylaxis against MAI is licensed. CD4 counts to monitor treatment Quite apart from their use to monitor the natural history of untreated HIV infection, CD4 counts are also used in two ways to monitor the effects of antiviral treatments. First, in clinical trials, changes in the CD4 count may give clues to the effectiveness of a treatment; for example, drugs like AZT, ddl and ddC have been shown to produce short-term increases in the number of CD4 cells. This has the potential to reduce the time it takes for the approval of new and effective anti-HIV drugs by reducing the need for trials to continue until it can be seen whether a new drug affects clinical endpoints, for example by reducing the number of opportunistic infections or prolonging life. Secondly, on an individual level, people taking antiviral drugs often use changes in their CD4 count to help them assess whether or how well the treatment is working. CD4 counts are only a surrogate, or indirect marker. To be valid, a marker must satisfy at least two criteria. First, the marker must genuinely reflect clinical progression - for example, declining counts must reflect increasing risk of opportunistic infections. As discussed above, the CD4 count has been shown to be a good marker in this respect. Secondly, the effect of a treatment on the marker must predict the impact of the treatment on clinical progression. It is less certain that the CD4 count fulfils this second condition. The only way to tell whether changes in CD4 count are a true surrogate marker for a treatment's clinical effects is through trials which continue for long enough for the treatment's clinical effects to be measurable. Some such studies have taken place, such as the Alpha ddl trial, or Concorde and the American ACTG 019 trials of AZT for asymptomatic people. These trials suggest that the effects of these drugs is only partially reflected in their effects on the CD4 count. The evidence from trials is contradictory. In trials such as ACTG 019, statisticians have calculated that improvements in the CD4 count were responsible for at most one quarter of the benefits seen among those taking the drug. In the ACTG 1 16B/11 7 trial comparing AZT and ddl, only about one third of ddls benefits for symptom-free people and people with ARC could be statistically explained by the CD4 count increase. These studies suggest that at best the CD4 count reflects only a fraction of the benefits of the treatments. But by contrast some studies have suggested that changes in the CD4 count may overstate the actual clinical benefits of a treatment. For example, in the Alpha trial the people receiving a higher dose of ddl tended to IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 31 [Page 32](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/38?q1=directories) have a larger CD4 count increase than those receiving a lower dose, but there was no equivalent difference in survival between the two groups. Likewise, in Concorde people taking immediate AZT had CD4 count increases which throughout the trial remained greater than the increases by people who took AZT later in the course of HIV disease, yet no clinical differences between the two treatment strategies in terms of disease progression or survival could be detected. It is important to know whether the CD4 count is a good surrogate marker for the effects of treatments; if not, its use could result in the adoption of ineffective drugs or even the dismissal of effective drugs as ineffective. Nevertheless, in the USA and much of Europe - although not Britain - CD4 count changes have been used as evidence of the benefits of anti-HIV drugs by drug licensing authorities. For example, in July 1991 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ddl for use by people with advanced HIV disease who could not tolerate or were not responding to AZT and in April 1993 the FDA conditionally approved ddC for use in combination with AZT, both on the basis of CD4 count data alone. Statisticians and clinicians are still debating how best to use the CD4 count to monitor treatment. On an individual level, most doctors and people with HIV will obviously be pleased if their CD4 count rises when they start to take a treatment such as AZT, and may be doubtful that a treatment is being helpful if no initial rise is seen. However, CD4 count increases with AZT tend to be short-lived and a range of other factors such as other laboratory tests, the occurence of infections and quality of life considerations may be taken into account when judging the longer term usefulness of the treatment. Many unanswered questions remain about the significance of the loss of CD4 cells in HIV infection and AIDS. Researchers are increasingly interested in the question of how well CD4 cells are working (known as CD4 function), quite apart from how many such cells there are (the CD4 count). For example, it is possible that an effective treatment might simply improve the functioning of CD4 cells, improving their ability to fight infections, without increasing their number. Some researchers believe that a decline in the number of CD4 cells in the blood might sometimes simply reflect the movement of CD4 cells out of the blood and into other tissues where they may be actively fighting infections. It is also important to remember that CD4 cells are only one part of the immune system, and it is quite possible that a useful treatment might have no effect on the CD4 count while still improving other parts of the immune system. Other immunological markers Beta2-microglobulin is a protein that appears on the surface of all cells with a nucleus. The quantity of beta2-microglobulin in blood rises whenever lymphocytes are activated or destroyed. Levels above 5 micrograms per litre suggest disease progression. It is easy to test for and quite a good predictor of progression in population studies. Neopterin is a low weight protein released from macrophages activated by T-lymphocytes. However, increases in serum neopterin levels are not specific to HIV disease since any activation for any reason will result in rises in neopterin. Levels are normally below 2 nanograms per millilitre but levels above 15 nanograms per millilitre suggest disease progression in population studies. Virological markers A growing number of American researchers and community activists have recently begun to speculate on the potential of new tests to shed light on levels of HIV in the body. This interest was evident at the 10th International Conference on AIDS in Yokohama, where many presentations focused on the use of virological markers to monitor disease progression and the effects of treatments. There are several types of virological test now coming into use. p24 antibody and antigen For several years clinicians and researchers have measured levels of the HIV protein p24 in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid and used it as a crude indication of the extent to which HIV is reproducing. However, p24 antigen levels are widely recognised as very imperfect markers. The body produces antibodies against p24 which bind to the p24 antigen and form clumps of antigen and antibodies called immune complexes. These can interfere with the accurate measurement of antigen levels. Often a blood sample is treated with acid before performing the p24 test, as this can separate the p24 antigen from the antibodies in immune complexes that are present in the sample, allowing somewhat more accurate measurement - this process is called acid dissociated p24 antigen testing. However, immune complexes in the body are rapidly removed from the circulation and destroyed, meaning that even with acid dissociation, p24 antigen is a very poor quantitative marker because the bulk of the antigen has been removed. However, the presence of p24 antigen can be a useful early indicator of whether the new-born child of an HIV-positive woman is itself infected with HIV. HIV culture HIV culture involves growing HIV directly in the laboratory from a sample of blood cells or blood plasma. It can provide the researcher with a supply of the HIV found within a individual, allowing its virulence and its susceptibility (or resistance) to antiretroviral drugs to be assessed. SI/NSI phenotype One possible indication of the virulence of a particular strain is whether it is an SI or NSI phenotype. As described above, some strains of HIV, called syncytium-inducing (SI) strains, are much more aggressive in laboratory studies than other non-synytium-inducing (NSI) strains. HIV-positive people in whom SI strains predominate appear to be at greater risk of disease progression, although people can still progress to AIDS even though they only have NSI strains. However, research into the significance of SI/NSI types is contradictory. It is possible that SI strains of HIV are not the problem themselves, but may simply reflect the consequence of increasing virus reproduction in the body. The more viruses are replicating, the more likely it is that mutations will lead to the emergence of virulent SI strains. In other words, it may not be the SI strains themselves which force the CD4 cell count down and result in a poor prognosis. Instead, increasing levels of active HIV in the body could be the cause of more rapid disease progression, and the development of SI strains may simply 32 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE [Page 33](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/39?q1=directories) be an insignificant side-effect of the rising amounts of virus in the body. DNA/RNA amplification Much more sensitive virological tests that use DNA amplification technology have been developed in recent years. DNA amplification is a method of detecting the presence of very small amounts of a specific piece of DNA, the genetic material contained inside the nucleus of cells. The most widely used method of DNA amplification is called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. PCR looks for the target piece of DNA in a sample of blood or tissue and if it is present, makes many copies of it in the test-tube until it can be detected by standard chemical assay tests. When HIV infects a cell, it inserts its own viral DNA into the DNA of the host cell. Even though it may then remain latent for long periods, the presence of the DNA can be detected using PCR. The test is so sensitive that it can detect the presence of one HIV-infected cell amidst 100,000 cells. RNA amplification tests work in the same way, but instead of looking for DNA they are aimed at RNA. While DNA is the form in which HIV's genetic material is found in cells that have already been infected, RNA is the form in which HIV's genetic material is found in virus particles or in newly infected cells. RNA tests may therefore give a better indication of current levels of HIV activity in the body, while DNA tests can give an indication of the overall level of infection including latently infected cells. The results of these tests are usually given in terms of the number of RNA or DNA sequences found per millilitre (copies/ml). Because modern PCR tests give some idea of the number of DNA or RNA sequences in the sample, they are sometimes known as quantitative viral tests, although their current limitations make it more accurate to call them semi-quantitative. Another way of measuring RNA levels uses a test called, confusingly, a branched DNA (bDNA) assay. This test does not amplify the genetic material like PCR, but instead marks it directly with a chemical that can be easily measured. The amount of the 'marker' chemical thus indicates how much RNA is present in the sample. While this test is less able to detect very small amounts of RNA than PCR, it is much easier to use in the laboratory. Virological markers & natural history Virological tests have been used to shed more light on the natural history of HIV infection. Soon after infection, levels of HIV in the blood rise dramatically. When the body starts to produce antibodies and seroconversion takes place, the natural immune response dramatically reduces levels of HIV detectable in the blood. These only start to rise again later in the course of disease, often accompanied by a decline in the CD4 count and an increased risk of the development of HIV-related symptoms or AIDS. However, HIV in the bloodstream is only one part - and probably a small part - of the overall picture. During the asymptomatic phase while levels of HIV in the bloodstream are low, levels of virus in the lymph nodes remain high. The lymph nodes are junction points in the lymphatic system, through which lymph fluids transports nourishment to the tissues and waste products away from them. They are also the place where many immune responses are coordinated. 98% of the body's CD4 cells are found in lymphoid tissue rather than in the bloodstream, and a high level of infection of the CD4 cells continues in the lymph nodes. HIV-infected CD4 cells and macrophages travel through the lymph nodes and into the bloodstream and body tissues. Gradually, the structure of the lymph nodes is destroyed and they no longer function properly. Some researchers have seized on virological markers with enthusiasm, arguing that high levels of HIV in the blood or lymph nodes are the underlying problem in HIV disease, with immunodeficiency and opportunistic infections as merely secondary consequences of the infection. They argue that the main purpose of antiviral treatment is to reduce levels of HIV in the body, and that virological tests alone should thus be an adequate measure of whether a drug is working in the individual Other researchers are more sceptical. They point out that before they can be accepted as genuine and accurate indicators, surrogate markers need to be validated. In the case of markers which are being used to monitor the natural history of HIV infection i.e. to monitor disease progression, a worsening in the individual's physical condition should be accompanied or predicted by a worsening in the marker. Data presented at the Third International Workshop on HIV Drug Resistance held in Hawaii just before the 1 Oth International Conference on AIDS in Yokohama suggested that there is a correlation between viral load in the blood and the CD4 count. In a placebo-controlled trial (known as 34,225-02) which studied AZT alone or in combination with ddl or ddC, the effects of the treatment regimes on HIV RNA levels closely paralleled their effect on the CD4 count. AZT alone produced a smaller and shorter-lasting reduction in RNA and increase in CD4 than either combination therapy regime, but AZT plus ddC had the greatest impact on RNA levels and also produced the largest and longest lasting CD4 boost. A few reports in Yokohama did attempt to examine the relationship between virological markers and clinical events. A study of 95 people with CD4 counts below 400 taking AZT monotherapy found that there was a clear link between levels of HIV in the blood and the risk of developing AZT resistance or dying. If HIV levels increased, so too did the risk of these adverse events. A low CD4 count was another strong predictor of death. Virological markers to monitor treatment A related but distinct question is whether a marker is an effective indicator of the effects of a treatment. After the doubts raised over the usefulness of CD4 counts as a marker of treatment effects, many researchers want to see rigorous assessment of virological markers before they are accepted as valid indicators of a treatment's usefulness. In particular, they say that studies must show that a treatment that reduces viral load also affects clinical endpoints, for example reducing or delaying symptoms or prolonging life, before the validity of virological markers can be accepted. They also stress that even if a marker is proven to be a valid marker for the effects of one treatment, it may not necessarily also be a valid marker for other treatments. A further consideration is that virological tests are most commonly applied to samples of blood, but as noted earlier, HIV levels in the blood may provide only a very incomplete picture of viral activity in the body as a whole. These tests can also be performed on samples of tissue such as lymph nodes, but it is highly impractical to take such tissue samples as part of routine monitoring IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 33 [Page 34](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/40?q1=directories) procedures. Even if a treatment is effective at reducing viral load in the bloodstream, it may have little or no effect on viral levels in the lymph nodes. Studies with the Roche protease inhibitor saquinavir (previously known as Ro 31-8959) alone or in combination with AZT and or ddC have shown a rough correlation between the effect on HIV replication as measured by RNA levels in the blood, and the effect on the CD4 count. In an Italian study first reported at last year's conference, the combination of AZT plus saquinavir produced a rapid and dramatic decline in HIV RNA levels and boosted the CD4 count significantly, while monotherapy with either drug had a smaller effect on viral load and CD4. In the study ACTG 229 the triple drug combination of AZT, ddC and saquinavir had a greater impact on viral levels and CD4 count than the two-drug combinations of either AZT plus ddC or AZT plus saquinavir. However, the difference between the two-drug combinations were less clear; while AZT plus ddC seemed to produce a greater CD4 increase than AZT plus saquinavir, it had a smaller impact on viraemia. It remains to be seen whether the drug's effect on either CD4 count or viral load translates into improved clinical outcome such as delaying disease or death. Early studies presented at the 10th International Conference on AIDS found preliminary evidence of a correlation between the effects of a treatment of viral load and clinical outcome. A report on participants in the Veterans Administration trial VA 298 which tested early versus delayed treatment with AZT found that those who had reduced levels of virus after 4 months of AZT were also at reduced risk of disease progression. Likewise, in Hawaii it was reported that in the study ACTG 116B/117, in which participants switched to ddl after a longer period of AZT use, people whose RNA levels rose during treatment were also at increased risk of developing new symptoms. Controversy over viral markers Some researchers, particularly in the USA, are already enthusiastically advocating the use of virological markers. Dr Clifford Lane of the US National Institutes of Health has reported that his research on a group of 29 HIV-positive people showed that those who had HIV RNA levels over 50,000 copies/ml of blood had a faster rate of CD4 count decline than people whose RNA levels were less than 10,000. He therefore proposes that measurement of RNA levels should become part of the routine monitoring of people with HIV, and those with high levels should be offered earlier and more aggressive antiviral treatment than those with lower levels, regardless of their current CD4 count. Some of these advocates argue that in the future, HIV is likely to be treated as soon as possible after infection with maybe 4 or 5 different drugs in combination, in an effort to bring viral load down virtually to zero. It might then be possible to provide 'maintenance therapy' with fewer drugs to maintain the viral load at that low level. By contrast, people with HIV have argued that the most important consideration is their physical state of health, rather than what laboratory tests on blood samples showed. British researchers typically feel that the Americans are being over-optimistic, and that the drugs that might translate the vision of stopping replication into reality simply are not currently available. Other sceptics argue that it is mistaken to place to much of an emphasis on viral markers since other factors (for example, auto-immune responses) may have a significant bearing on the disease. Paul Griffiths, Professor of Virology at the Royal Free Hospital in London, argues that AIDS is more complicated than just the presence of HIV, and that other viral infections have demonstrated that simply inhibiting the virus does not necessarily change the course of the disease. In Britain, the Medical Research Council (MRC) is using virological tests in the Quattro trial to screen drug combinations. Various combinations of anti-retroviral drugs are given to a small number of people, and those regimes which have the most marked effect on viral load will be treated as priority candidates for testing in full-scale trials with clinical endpoints. The most important information on the reliability or otherwise of virological markers is likely to come from trials such as Delta or the American study ACTG 175, both of which are large-scale, long-term trials of combinations of AZT plus ddl and/or ddC. Detailed virological tests are being performed on blood samples from participants, allowing researchers to see whether changes in viral measures can predict longer-term clinical outcome. 34 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE [Page 35](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/41?q1=directories) Challenges to orthodox views about AIDS Why are there challenges? Not everyone is entirely convinced that HIV is the cause of AIDS. A minority of people have come to the conclusion that the hypotthesis that HIV causes AIDS is flawed, and have sought other explanations for the causes of the disease. This form of scientific dispute is by no means confined to the field of AIDS; there is vigorous scientific debate about the causes of many diseases. What makes the debate over the causes of AIDS different is the extent to which the issue has become politicised by media coverage and allegations of a conspiracy between scientists and phramaceutical companies. It's also notable that researchers who have been working in the field since the beginning of the epidemic are in virtually unanimous agreement that HIV is the cause of AIDS, and virtually no prominent scientists in the fields of virology and immunology have endorsed the criticisms of the HIV-AIDS link. Despite this consensus, the link between HIV and AIDS continues to come under vigorous attack. Why do critics of the theory believe that the association between HIV and AIDS is false? The basis for doubts Critics of the theory have pointed out a number of apparent anomalies: * The failure of HIV to cause AIDS in animals such as chimpanzees * Cases of AIDS in which it has not been possible to isolate HIV, even with the most sophisticated testing * Other potentially immunosuppressive factors are just as common as HIV in people who develop AIDS * Cases of AIDS have come to light from before 1981 * HIVhas failed to spread out of the population groups in which it first appeared * The lack of specificity of HIV antibody testing - critics of the test claim that other illnesses and medical conditions can cause people to react positive to the HIV antibody test. If this is so, the apparently close epidemiological link between HIV and AIDS may be false * HIV is far more difficult to transmit than most other infectious viruses * Some people are exposed to HIV without developing antibodies to HIV * Diseases caused by viruses do not have an incubation period of ten to fifteen years HIV and AIDS in animals HIV-2 causes an AIDS-like illness in chimpanzees, but immunodeficiency viruses do not usually cause illness if they are innoculated into another species. This has now been observed with immunodeficiency viruses affecting monkeys, cats, horses and humans. It is believed that this is due to the species-specific adaptation of immunodeficiency viruses, which cause illness by interfering with the immune system of their host. For instance, it is now thought that one of the reasons why HIV does not cause illness in chimpanzees is because it does not infect macrophages (white blood cells which engulf bacteria and viruses), whereas in humans HIV does infect macrophages. In the case of HIV-2, it is suspected that its greater genetic resemblence to SIV (the simian immunodeficiency virus) makes it more likely to cause illness than HIV-1, which has mutated away from HIV-2. However SIV does cause CD4 cell loss in macaques monkeys. AIDS-defining illnesses without HIV Studies in people with AIDS have shown that in many cases, not all people diagnosed with AIDS have recoverable HIV in their blood, or antibodies to HIV. There may be a number of reasons for this. Levels of HIV tend to be very high in the weeks after infection and in the period just before an individual becomes symptomatic. Levels of HIV are often very low when people with HIV are healthy. Much of the HIV infection is contained in the lymph nodes and the spleen, and does not circulate in the blood. It is hardly surprising that it can be difficult to isolate HIV from asymptomatic people. Many of the studies which looked at people with AIDS tried to detect antibodies to HIV, but in the cases where they failed scientists believe that this is because these people are so immunocompromised they cannot form antibodies. In cases where the researchers failed to find HIV itself, it may indeed be the case that immunodeficiency was caused by factors other than HIV (Duncan; Ho; Sheppard). Since some people diagnosed with AIDS-defining illnesses are not HIV-positive, this suggests that other causes of immunosuppression are also responsible (see AIDS without HIV). There are two problems with using evidence of this sort to argue that HIV does not cause AIDS. Firstly, the AIDS definition includes a number of illnesses which are common (such as tuberculosis) in people with poor health or those with lowered immunity. It is not surprising therefore that there will be a margin of error, and if this is the case, the AIDS definition needs to be tightened up to ensure that only those diagnosed with HIV IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 35 [Page 36](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/42?q1=directories) antibodies are described as having AIDS. The only thing that these sort of AIDS cases prove is that the AIDS definition needs to be revised. They do not prove that HIV isn't the cause of AlDS. Secondly, in countries without facilities for widespread testing the diagnosis of AIDS is made in the absence of HIV antibody testing. In developing countries the AIDS definition includes various non-specific symptoms such as the presence of diarrhoea or fever for more than one month or weight loss of more than 10% of body weight. An AIDS diagnosis can only be applied in such circumstances if cancer or malnutrition is not suspected. Subsequent testing inevitably reveals that some people do not have antibodies to HIV despite an AIDS diagnosis, indicating that their immune deficiency has other causes (Hishida). Critics of the HIV-AIDS link argue that AIDS diagnoses in people without HIV 'prove' that HIV does not cause AIDS in anyone. It is more reasonable to assume that other factors may cause AIDS-defining illnesses in some people, but that HIV causes AIDS in most people, given the strong association between HIV and AIDS. A study conducted in Uganda shows that annual death rate among people definitively shown to be HIV-positive was 115.9 per 1000, compareds with only 7.7 per 1000 in uninfected people. Among adults, half of all deaths and over 80% of deaths among those aged 13-44 were attributable to HIV infection. Mulder DW et al. Two-year HIV-7 -associated mortality in a Ugandan rural population. Lancet 343:1021- 1023, 1994. Other risk factors of people with AIDS It is argued that there are many potentially immunosuppressive factors which are just as common as HIV in people who develop AIDS. This is an argument about the strength of the association between HIV and AIDS. Epidemiologists say that even if there are some anomalies which call into question the link between HIV and AIDS, there is still a stronger association between HIV and AIDS than any other risk factor; in other words, HIV is the most common potential cause shared by people who develop AIDS. HIV has been found amongst all the risk groups in which AIDS has appeared, but no other common factor is shared by all the risk groups. Some have argued that AIDS emerged in different risk groups at similar times because of different risk factors which deplete cellular immunity. According to this argument, it is a coincidence that HIV appeared at the same time in these different risk groups, and a coincidence that the presence or absence of HIV can be matched so closely with the development of AIDS amongst the risk groups. Amongst gay men long term recreational drug use is claimed to be sufficient to cause AIDS, but case control studies which have compared drug using gay men with non-drug using gay men have failed to show an association as firm as the one between HIV and AIDS. Doctors at the University of British Columbia in Canada compared two groups of gay men with broadly similar levels of drug consumption over the past ten years, one HIV-positive, the other HIV-negative. Of 78 HIV-negative men who had reported the use of poppers on every visit to the research clinic over a ten year period, not one had developed an AIDS-defining illness and their average CD4 counts remained almost unchanged after ten years. In contrast 19 men were identified who had suffered dramatic declines in CD4 count despite reporting no drug use or receiving any treatment with a potentially immunosuppressive effect. Yet in Prof Peter Duesberg's view, the only thing that distinguishes the HIV-positive and the HIV-negative drug users is that the HIV-negative gay men haven't developed AIDS 'yet'. The study also found no difference between frequent HIV-positive nitrite users and occasional nitrite users in the frequency or the speed with which they developed opportunistic infections. If nitrites really do speed the development of AIDS, or even act as a co-factor alongside HIV infection, a difference between heavy and light users would be expected. This finding was confirmed by another study conducted by doctors in San Francisco following a group of men recruited from the San Francisco electoral register in the early 1980s. This group, or cohort, included heterosexual men as well as HIV-negative men, drug users and non-drug users, so it is an essential cohort to examine if the drugs=AIDS hypothesis is to be proved correct. Some critics of the HIV-AIDS link have pointed to the role of semen, sexually transmitted infections and antibiotics in suppressing the immune systems of gay men who develop AIDS. It is certainly true that there is an association between a large number of sexual partners, a history of unprotected receptive anal intercourse and a history of sexually transmitted infections and HIV positivity. This is consistent with the view that HIV causes AIDS; as with any other sexually transmitted infection those with the greatest number of partners will have a greater chance of comimg into contact with the infectious agent. Early in the epidemic some researchers investigated the possibility that semen was causing immunosuppression when it came into contact with the bloodstream through anal intercourse, and that exposure to large quantities of semen is especially damaging to immunity. Research in this area has been abandoned despite suggestive findings in the early 1980s, but it cannot be dismissed out of hand. The immunosuppressive effects of semen may well play a role in the transmission of HIV to heterosexual women, and it may facilitate infection with HIV in anal intercourse too. Sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus have an immunosuppressive effect; CMV and EBV can cause a depressed CD4 count for many months and alter T-cell ratios (one of the first detected signs of widespread immunosuppression amongst US gay men). Research into the immunosuppressive effects of sexually transmitted infections was very limited when AIDS emerged, and has largely been ignored since the discovery of HIV. However, recent studies in people with haemophilia suggest that there is little difference in the disease progression of HIV-positive people infected with CMV compared with those without CMV. It is therefore hard to believe that CMV alone could cause significant and progressive damage to the immune system. Amongst people with haemophilia, it has been shown that blood products in themselves are immunosuppressive, yet comparative studies have shown that Factor VIII does not 36 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE [Page 37](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/43?q1=directories) cause life-threatening immunosuppression in people without HIV antibodies. It has also been argued that since only those with high exposure to Factor VIII have developed AIDS, this is an indication of the immunosuppressive potential of Factor VIII. In fact, research shows that AIDS has also developed in haemophiliacs who received relatively small quantities of Factor VIII and who were in relatively good health before infection with HIV (Chelucci; Cuthbert; Gjerset; Kroner; Ludlam; Madhok). Amongst tranfusion recipients AIDS is claimed to develop as a consequence of transfusion related immunosuppression, usually due to transfusion of very large quantities of blood. A review of transfusion-related AIDS cases has shown that the key risk factor for HIV infection the subsequent development of AIDS was not quantity of blood received but the health of the donor. If the donor developed AIDS less than two and a half years after the transfusion, the recipient was also much more likely to develop AIDS, an observation which suggests that the disease state in the donor does indeed influence the recipient, and that immunosuppression is not simply caused by foreign human proteins (Ashton). Many other diseases are also transmitted in blood transfusions; hepatitis B is a good example. It may well be the case that other diseases transmitted by transfusion exacerbate the immunosuppression caused by HIV. It has also been claimed that AIDS in Africa and other developing countries is not caused by HIV, but by malnutrition, unlimited use of antibiotics and a high background level of infectious disease. Critics of the HIV-AIDS link back up this argument by pointing to the number of AIDS cases identified as HIV-negative in some studies in Africa, and argue that the effects of malnutrition are being misdiagnosed. In fact, even using the African AIDS definition (see WHO definitions of stages of HIV infection), doctors are specifically asked to exclude malnutrition as a cause of immune deficiency before diagnosing AIDS. Malnutrition can be easily diagnosed by any properly trained doctor. Doctors in Africa who are convinced that HIV does cause AIDS have responded to claims about the possible causes of AIDS by asking why AIDS appeared only in 1983 if these factors are responsible for the syndrome (Grmek). All these ingredients have been present for at least twenty years in many African countries without causing a distinct syndrome which was widely recognised as new by African doctors. Significantly, no doctors working in Africa have come forward to question the novelty of AIDS in their countries. It is only Western journalists and activists who see AIDS as an 'old' set of diseases with a new name. Amongst injecting drug users long term heroin use is claimed to be sufficient to cause AIDS, yet long-term injecting drug users without HIV do not develop progressive CD4 loss and AIDS, although they may develop AIDS-defining illnesses such as tuberculosis due to exposure to TB coupled with poor nutrition and living conditions, the long-recognised risk factors for tuberculosis. Cases of AIDS before 1981 If HIV is new, why did people in high risk groups die of AIDS-related illnesses before the 1980s? This is an argument made in ignorance of recent discoveries about HIV and past case reports of mysterious illness which appear to correspond to the description of AIDS. AIDS was first identified as a distinct syndrome in 1981 as the consequence of a cluster of cases amongst gay men in large US cities. Subsequent review of the medical literature has revealed a plethora of inexplicable AIDS-like illnesses dating back to the late 1940s in the United States and Europe. Pre-1981 cases fall into two categories: those for which stored blood samples have revealed HIV infection, and those for which no stored blood samples exist. The oldest AIDS case for which an HIV diagnosis has been confirmed is that of a Manchester sailor who died in 1959. Nothing is known about him except for the fact that he visited Africa. Doctors thought his death from multiple opportunistic infections so odd they wrote it up in The Lancet and stored tissue and blood for future investigation. An American youth who died in 1969 has also been retrospectively diagnosed, as have a Norwegian familyfather, mother and child - who all died in 1976. They had no apparent risk factors apart from infection with HIV. A Portuguese man who fell ill in 1978 has been retrospectively diagnosed as one of the earliest cases of AIDS caused by HIV-2. The identified cases in which HIV was present are important because they challenge the belief that HIV is a virus which was introduced into the West in the 1970s. Although some of these cases indicate contact with Africa, the 1969 case of an American youth shows no evidence of an African connection. Clinical records have also been used to identify pre-1981 cases. Historians have looked for unusual cases recorded in the medical literature which appear to fit the existing definition of AIDS. A suprising number of such reports exist, dating back to at least 1940 in North America and Europe. Prior to 1960, all the cases identified in North America were men, but thereafter women begin to account for possible cases too, and at least one married couple have been identified (Grmek). Similar detailed reports do not exist for Africa, except for data concerning Kaposi's sarcoma, which became epidemic in equatorial Africa in the late 1950s. This form of KS, which took the lethal form only in about 10% of cases, was not associated with HIV or with immune suppression, and affected Africans but not Westerners resident in Africa. It has recently been suggested that a number of different forms of KS may exist, perhaps with radically different causes, so it is as well to be sceptical of the appearance of KS as a marker for the widespread presence of HIV in Africa before the 1970s. African doctors tend to agree that AIDS did not appear in Africa before the late 1970s, and that it became epidemic only in the early 1980s. Isolated cases of AIDS-defining illnesses began to appear among gay men and injecting drug users from the early 1970s in New York and San Francisco. Researchers argue that AIDS cases could have occurred at a low level in the population before the 1940s without exciting much suspicion, due to a greater frequency of infectious diseases. A greater prevalence of infectious IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 37 [Page 38](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/44?q1=directories) disease would have meant that people with weakened immunity would have died of common infections rather than the usual diseases now seen in people diagnosed with AIDS. It was only when infectious disease became less common that immune deficiency became more remarkable and worthy of note. Prior to the introduction of antibiotics, diagnoses of diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis may have masked minor clusters of HIV disease, in the view of historian Mirko Grmek. Some scientists believe that HIV may have existed for many years as a relatively harmless virus in humans, but that changing conditions have made it more virulent. SIV has been observed to cause progressively more serious disease as it passes through a chain of monkeys, suggesting that adapting to a new host increases the virulence of an immunodeficiency virus. Conditions which encourage the transmission of retroviruses will therefore encourage the development of more dangerous strains of retroviruses. When a retrovirus strain has few opportunities to encounter new hosts, it will tend to remain in a state of equilibrium with its host species in order to continue reproducing itself. It would be suicidal in such circumstances to kill the host. If however a strain of HIV began to pass through a series of hosts, this control might go. Weaker hosts may allow the virus to grow unchecked. HIV-1 and HIV-2 serve as examples of divergent strains which may indicate the evolutionary path of HIV. HIV-2 causes disease less frequently than HIV-1, and seems to be more difficult to transmit through sexual intercourse. Until recently HIV-2 was confined largely to Western Africa. HIV-1 may have diverged from HIV-2 some decades ago, and become more virulent as it became more widespread and more frequently transmitted. HIV's permanence in the first population groups Critics of the HIV-AIDS link point to the failure of HIV to spread as predicted as proof that it is not the cause of AIDS. This is a particularly weak criticism which exhibits a fundamental lack of understanding of epidemiology, because it is quite possible to explain why HIV has not spread outside the high risk groups without having to throw out HIV as the cause of AIDS. HIV has failed to spread widely amongst heterosexuals in the developed world due to a lack of pathways for the virus. These are discussed immediately below. In the forty years before AIDS emerged, the world changed more rapidly than at any time since the discovery of the Americas. Some of the changes were to facilitate the AIDS epidemic. Population movements brought millions to big cities, and economic conditions frequently separated men and women from their partners. A growth in prostitution and polygamy occurred in African cities and on trade routes between African countries. A dramatic growth in sexually transmitted diseases took place. Medicine changed dramatically in Africa, with the increased use of injections and transfusions as part of treatment. Owing to lack of resources, needles were not always sterilised or disposed of between patients. Mass immunisation programmes took place without rigourous sterilisation of needles. International travel made contacts between different countries and continents commonplace. For example, during the late 1970s an increasing number of European homosexuals began to visit North America as airline travel became cheaper. Africans visited Europe more frequently, and large numbers of Europeans went to work in Africa. Sexual tourism to destinations such as Haiti and Thailand made a significant contribution to the local economies and attracted visitors from throughout the developed world. Taboos against homosexuality were vigorously challenged, especially in English speaking countires and Northern Europe. Visible organised gay communities emerged in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles during the 1970s which attracted gay men from all over the world to visit or settle. It is estimated that fifty thousand gay men moved to San Francisco between 1969 and 1982. Sexual freedom was a primary value of these new communities, reflecting a wider sexual revolution in developed countries. Bathhouses and backrooms which allowed for multiple sexual contacts were a key feature of these communities. Anther new feature of the emerging gay lifestyle was the versatility of sexual roles. Until the 1970s much homosexual activity had depended on the maintenance of clear sexual roles of active and passive in anal intercourse, but as gay men became more open and liberated, this role separation was increasingly questioned and challenged. Fewer and fewer individuals were either exclusively active or passive. Sexually transmitted infections, antibiotic use and recreational drug use amongst this population were all extremely high, and it was not at all uncommon for gay men in their thirties to have had over one thousand sexual partners in their lifetime. This was a very dramatic change from the limited numbers of sexual partners enjoyed by most gay men before the 1960s. Blood transfusions became increasingly commonplace in medical practice, and an industry grew up dedicated both to serving the requirements for blood and for blood products. In the United States paid donors were used. This blood was sent around the world, and US blood donations were sold to Africa during the 1970s. It is also alleged that blood was also gathered from Africa for supply to the developed world, although blood companies deny that such a trade went on. In the late 1960s haemophiliacs began to benefit from the discovery that Factor VIII could be synthesised from donated blood. Manufacturers were soon gathering Factor VIII from between 2000 and 20000 donors in order to produce Factor VIII concentrate for distribution all over the world. Intravenous drug use grew dramatically in the 1970s as heroin became increasingly available in the wake of the Vietnam war. The war introduced thousands of US troops to heroin and the US government actively abetted heroin smugglers in Laos who opposed the Communists, permitting huge quantities of heroin to flood to the West. Wars in Afghanistan and Lebanon also augmented the global supply of heroin, which was processed through Meditteranean ports such as Marseilles and Naples. Large 38 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE [Page 39](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/45?q1=directories) drug dependent communities grew up in Southern European cities which acted as entrepots for heroin. The growth in injecting drug use was also assisted by the arrival of disposable plastic syringes in the early 1 970s, and drug using institutions also developed in some large cities - shooting galleries - where addicts could go to score drugs and rent injecting equipment. The growth of addict populations also led to an increase in prostitution to support drug habits, amongst both male and female drug users. All these factors provided pathways for HIV to spread through more and more bodies, generating strains which perhaps became more virulent with each new host encountered. These pathways tended to concentrate HIV infection in certain population groups - the high risk groups - but the lack of such pathways also prevented HIV from spreading amongst the rest of the population (Grmek). 0 0 Variance in the incubation period It is argued that the radically different times between infection with HIV and the onset of AIDS undermines the belief that HIV plays the key role in the development of AIDS. This argument is often used to discredit HIV as the cause of AIDS, based on the view that most illnesses have a standard incubation period. Yet syphilis exhibits similar variable incubation periods, with a primary illness followed by a long incubation period which can last years or decades and produce all manner of symptoms, severe in some individuals but almost imperceptible in others. This phenomenon has never been considered reason enough to reject treponema pallidum as the cause of syphilis. The cause of the variable incubation period has been located in the virus itself. HIV is not one single strain of virus, but many variants, and there are at least three substantially divergent strains (HIV-1, HIV-2 and type O) which exhibit substantially differing pathogenic effects. Whilst HIV-1 causes disease rapidly - often within five years - HIV-2 appears to take considerably longer. Australian researchers have recently demonstrated that a key reason for the differences in the asymptomatic period between HIV-positive individuals is the strain of virus with which they are infected. Using New South Wales Blood Transfusion Service records between 1980 and 1985, the team identified 25 individuals with transfusion-acquired HIV infection for whom the exact dates of the infection in the eight donors who provided the infected blood could be established. Progression to AIDS and death was significantly slower in people who received blood from donors with slow disease progression than in those with blood from donors with faster progression. Median survival in recipients from donors who progressed to AIDS with five years was just over two years, but it was more than nine years for those who had received blood from donors who had still not progressed after 11 years (Ashton). Age is the only clear co-factor to have emerged from cohort studies; older people are likely develop AIDS quicker. There may be a number of reasons for this. Firstly, immune competence declines with age. Secondly, it may be the case that during their lifetimes older people will have acquired a greater number of organisms which interact with HIV to make the virus replicate faster. The accuracy of HIV tests Doubts have recently been raised in some sections of the UK press about the accuracy of HIV testing. A recent medical journal review of HIV testing argued that a positive HIV test may not react to antibodies to HIV, but to other infections which can produce very similar antibodies (Papadopolous-Eleopulos). The authors argue that an HIV positive result is either a completely false result, or in some circumstances a consequence of an overload of infections which can lead to immune suppression and to the appearance of substances in the blood which can be mistaken for HIV antibodies. The review suggested that: * The Western Blot test cannot distinguish HIV antibodies from antibodies to some other infections. These include malaria and warts. Autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis may also lead to false positive results. A positive result may even be a reaction to human proteins which have a similar molecular weight to those of HIV. * The ELISA test is inaccurate for similar reasons. * HIV is very difficult to isolate from most people, circulates in very low levels in the blood and cannot therefore be regarded as infectious. The likelihood that some people will falsely test positive for HIV antibodies by the Western Blot method is widely known amongst virologists and is one reason why the test is rarely used for confirmatory purposes in the UK. It is true that false positive results could arise as a result of similarities in the molecular weight of proteins derived from cellular material rather than from HIV. Rare antibody cross-reactions have been documented in individuals with auto-immune illnesses such as lupus and multiple sclerosis, and in the case of people who have recently been vaccinated against hepatitis B, influenza and tetanus. Transient positive HIV antibody reactions after vaccination have been reported, but a positive antibody test for HIV has not been detected upon subsequent tests. Transient false positive results have also been seen in blood dialysis patients and recipients of blood transfusions. It should be emphasised that all these false positive results are isolated reports; in the case of multiple sclerosis, for instance, such reports are vastly outnumbered by studies which have failed to find HIV antibodies in large numbers of MS patients who lack known risks. Particular antibodies considered to be specific for HIV also seem to appear in uninfected people as a consequence of other infections or auto-immune problems. For instance, 13% of people with warts were shown in one study to have antibodies to p24 but not to any other HIV antigens. In the same study 41% of a group of patients with multiple sclerosis were shown to have antibody to p24 but no other antibody (Ranki). Cross-reactions to other proteins such as gp41 have also been observed, but cross-reactions to all IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 39 [Page 40](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/46?q1=directories) these proteins at once has never been reported. Thus it is very important that HIV infection only be diagnosed upon the presence of a range of HIV antibodies: antibodies to p24 and p31 (HIV core proteins), and to either gp41, gpl 20 or gpl 60 (envelope proteins). Another problem is caused by human HLA molecules, which may become attached to protein fragments of HIV as it buds from an infected cell. The function of HLA molecules is to grab fragments of HIV protein and present them to T-lymphocytes. Other antibodies can become bonded to these cellular antigens, causing a false positive result. Western Blot relies on a subjective judgement of the intensity of the bands of antibody which form in response to particular antigens. It also relies upon well-trained technical staff, so false positive results are possible with this method just as with any other laboratory test. For all these reasons Western Blot results should be treated with caution. Is a positive ELISA test proof of infection? An ELISA test uses HIV proteins which have been specially engineered outside the human body to ensure that there is no possibility of antibody reactivity with human cellular material. One problem experienced with the earlier generation of tests was the appearance of antibodies to human proteins which contaminated the HIV proteins used in the test. Because the HIV was cultured from infected human lymphocytes, it was inevitable that a degree of contamination would exist. Subsequent ELISA tests used genetic recombinant technology to produce highly purified HIV proteins free of cellular material from mammals. The tests use proteins judged to be specific to HIV, and select genetically defined regions of the virus which vary little from one strain to another. Other ELISA tests use fragments of HIV protein which have been cultivated in the laboratory and then highly purified to remove contaminating proteins. These fragments are called synthetic peptides, and are judged to provide the most specific HIV antibody reactions. In order to reduce the possibility of false positive reactions, the designers of ELISA tests have taken two steps to ensure that the test is accurate. The first is to design what is called a competitive test. In this test HIV proteins, or antigens, produced by the recombinant method described above, are used as the basis for the test. Blood is added to the testing kit at the same time as a specific, pre-prepared antibody to HIV. This pre-prepared antibody is linked to an enzyme which can cause a colour change upon the addition of a chemical. The antibody is engineered to bind only to one particular HIV antigen rather than to the range present in the assay, as individual testing kits are known. The real antibody in the blood and the manufactured enzyme-linked antibody then compete to bind onto the HIV antigens in the testing kit. A chemical is added and the blood is then washed away; if HIV antibodies are not present in the blood there will be no colour change, because the enzyme-linked antibody will have largely bound onto the HIV antigen. If HIV antibodies are present in the blood, the enzyme-linked antibody will be largely unable to bind onto the antigen. This means the colour change will be obvious, and technicians will match the colour intensity against a control chart which has been established after testing both in HIV positive and healthy HIV-negative people considered to be at very low risk of developing AIDS. The second is to ensure that any test conducted uses a variety of assays, based on different antigen preparations. One test will use a synthetic peptide, another will use a recombinant antigen, whilst a third confirmatory test will use a competitive ELISA assay. This range of assays should test the blood sample against a spectrum of antigens rather than a single set of antigens derived from one particular viral culture. The range of assays used will have been objectively measured as specific for HIV when compared with an HIV-negative, healthy control group not believed to be at high risk for HIV infection. In the early years of HIV testing the presence of antibodies to malaria could lead to false positive results (Biggar). This is rarely the case due to an improvement in the specificity of the test, which had originally been designed without taking into account the prevalence of malarial antibody in populations different from the United States, where the tests were first developed. A recent study using newer antibody test kits failed to demonstrate any difference in prevalence of malarial antibody between seropositive and seronegative blood donors in an equatorial country, suggesting that people with malarial antibodies were no more likely to test positive for HIV antibodies (Burke; Chattopadhya; Ranki; Papadopolous-Eleopolous). The infectivity of HIV If HIV is so difficult to detect, why is it infectious? This criticism is based on the view that HIV is a retrovirus which, like hundreds of others, has been incorporated into the human genome for many thousands of years without harmful effects. It is passed on from mother to child in the same way as any other information encoded into the genes, and will only become activated, or expressed, when exposed to certain stimuli. The proposed mechanisms by which the latent retrovirus becomes activated include: excessive activation of the immune system, drug use and exposure to free radicals produced by the process of oxidation (Papadopolous-Eleopolous). According to this view, HIV antibodies are a marker of immunosuppression, and the virus is not in itself pathogenic. It is the processes which cause the virus to be activated which are pathogenic and which eventually cause the symptoms of AIDS. However, this theory fails to offer a convincing explanation for the observable increases in HIV antibodies, year by year, in cohorts of people at risk for AIDS. Amongst gay men, for instance, cohort studies in a number of cities have shown the classic progresssion of an infectious epidemic year by year as seroconversions occurred amongst gay men. Seroprevalence rose from 4.5% in San Francisco in 1978 to 12% in 1979 to 24% in 1980 amongst a group of gay men recruited to test a hepatitis B vaccine. It should be noted that only a small proportion of this group actually received the vaccine, making it highly unlikely that the vaccine itself caused false positive results on a large scale (CDC; Curran). 40 IMMUNITY AND DISEASE [Page 41](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/47?q1=directories) The theory also fails to explain why some haemophiliacs exposed to the same immunological stresses by Factor 8 treatment as those who remained HIV-negative should have seroconverted within very tight time periods (corresponding to their exposure to infected Factor 8). If seroconversion were an individualised response to external immune compromising factors rather than a response to infection, we would not expect to see such a tight distribution of seroconversions amongst haemophiliacs. Antibodies also appear upon contact with the blood of infected individuals after both transfusions and needlestick injuries. We know that these antibodies are not passively acquired i.e. they are not contained in the blood introduced into the body. We know this because most transfusion infections have occurred after screening for antibodies failed to detect antibodies. In some cases evidence of HIV replication can be found in the source of the blood despite the absence of antibodies, and a very strong genetic similarity between the viruses in the infectious and the infected individual has been noted (de Biasi). Those who claim that HIV is not transmissable often cite the cases of partners of HIV-positive individuals who remain HIV-negative to support their view. It is undoubtedly the case that some risk groups have lower rates of transmission from one partner to another. This is probably due to sexual practice (anal intercourse is a far more efficient transmitter of HIV than vaginal intercourse). It is also connected to immunity. Although the mechanisms by which humans can successfully fight an infection by HIV are still poorly understood, it is becoming clear that the cellular immune system can successfully deal with infection with HIV in its earliest stages. Evidence is also emerging that localised immunity in the vagina plays a role in preventing infection (Holmberg). Finally, infectivity appears to vary according to the stage of infection. Viral load is very high during the early weeks of HIV infection, and by implication infectivity will be greatest when viral load is highest, so HIV will spread most rapidly in those populations which have the highest rates of partner change or needle sharing in the shortest period of time (Ho). The HIV antibody response One criticism refers to the many cases where individuals have been exposed to blood or semen from an HIV-infected individual, yet have failed to develop HIV antibodies or show signs of infection. Critics of the HIV-AIDS link say that this proves that HIV cannot spread easily and that HIV antibodies are produced as the consequence of the activation of latent HIV as the consequence of immunological over-activation. In fact there has been considerable research into what happens in individuals who remain uninfected despite repeated exposure. It may occur because individuals mount a cytotoxic T-cell response, which means that the virus and virus-infected cells are quickly eliminated by the CD8 cells. It has also been suggested that in cases where infection does not occur, this is because the individual has been challenged with a defective or weak strain of HIV which is easy for the immune system to eliminate (Levy). Delays in the onset of AIDS Why does AIDS take up to fifteen years to develop? It is well established that there is one group of viruses whch take many years to cause disease - the slow retroviruses, or lentiviruses. In animals viruses such as visna virus, feline leukemia virus and equine anaemia virus take many years to cause disease. HIV belongs to this group of viruses. It is also well established that many illnesses with a viral cause take many years to manifest. Chronic liver disease as a consequence of hepatitis B infection does not happen overnight - the pathogenic process takes a number of years and varies from one individual to another.

IMMUNITY AND DISEASE 41 [Page 42](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/48?q1=directories) Treatment and lifestyle choices Introduction The diversity of options This chapter examines the very many treatment and lifestyle choices available to people with HIV and AIDS in dealing with their health and illness. The chapter encompasses a wide range of approaches to health and illness reflecting both the diversity of problems that may be faced by people with HIV and the diversity of responses that have been made to HIV and AIDS by different branches of medicine and different medical or health traditions. This range of choices presents both opportunities and problems. It is essential that any individual's approach to negotiating these options is properly informed and that the practitioner or practitioners she or he is dealing with know about all the treatment decisions that are made. No individual clinician or practitioner will have an in depth understanding of all the treatment options decribed in this chapter. However, an understanding of the range of options will help any individual obtain the best advice and care from the health professionals they deal with. 42 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES Attacking the virus The dominant response of western medicine and research to AIDS has been to try and disable the human immunodeficiency virus itself. The next section in this chapter examines the variety of ways in which this can be attempted and the limited success that this approach has achieved. In recent years there has been some disillusionment with anti-viral research as the huge investments made in it have yielded relatively meagre results. However the many different points of vulnerability in the lifecycle of the virus still present some of the best opportunities for treatment research. Boosting the immune system The virological approach is increasingly complemented by immunological research, ie. attempts to improve the function of the immune system so that it can respond better to the virus or to the specific infections and cancers of AIDS. This approach is not without its problems - the immune system is incredibly complex and cannot be 'boosted' in any straightforward sense. [Page 43](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/49?q1=directories) Furthermore, the fact that HIV penetrates the immune system raises the possibility of improvements in the functioning of the immune system leading to increased replication of the virus. Inhibiting infectious co-factors The process by which HIV affects the immune system leading to the onset of AIDS is still only partially understood. It has been suggested that there are other agents - or 'co-factors' - in this process, and consequently one approach to preventing AIDS is to try and inhibit or avoid such co-factors. As yet there is only limited evidence of co-factors: of the many candidates for such a role, only for the herpes viruses is there any substantial evidence. Preventing and treating opportunistic infections A virus, a compromised immune system, and a range of possible co-factors still do not constitute AIDS. The prevention and treatment of the opportunistic infections and tumours that are the defining features of the syndrome remains the centre of the treatment concerns for many people with symptomatic disease, and also for some people with asymptomatic disease seeking to avoid the onset of illness. Complementary and alternative therapies Complementary and alternative therapies encompass a huge diversity of treatment and health choices, some of which - such as traditional Chinese medicine and homoeopathy - present completely self-contained approaches to health and illness which may be radically different from the familiar western model. Other therapies are commonly used alongside orthodox treatment. They may have specific clinical aims or may function therapeutically through stress reduction, pain relief or improvements in general health and well-being - all of which may be critically important for someone with HIV or AIDS. Protecting your health in daily life The importance of healthy living also raises questions about the environment we live in and how health can be maximised within it without disrupting our freedom. The principal concern is the avoidance of bacteria or other infections that may cause particular diseases or suppress or weaken the immune sytem. This concerns hygiene, the water supply, food poisoning, travel, sex and drug use. These concerns may or may not require substantial lifestyle changes depending on the individual's assessment of their importance. Nutrition and vitamins For people living with symptomatic disease or AIDS, good nutrition is often an essential part of keeping well. The effects of particular opportunistic infections or of particular treatment drugs can include problems such as weight loss and malabsorption which will require special forms of diet or nutritional supplements. Many claims are made for a wide variety of vitamins and minerals in improving general health and wellbeing. The use and benefits of vitamin supplements are considered in this section. When to start treatment A key issue for people who have HIV but are well is when (or if) they should start treatment. A perspective which is concerned - reasonably - with the activity of the virus may encourage 'early intervention' with antiviral drugs, i.e. treatment to disable the virus before it has the opportunity to damage the immune system. This approach has considerable problems, not least because research has shown that such early use of antivirals may have no advantages overall compared to taking such drugs when illness is actually being experienced. Some also argue that exposing a healthy body to the possible toxicities of antiviral drugs is a mistake if the overall functioning of the body and the immune system is to be protected. Preventative vaccines Research into vaccines to protect individuals against infection with HIV has gathered momentum in recent years. Trials in animals have had some success and large-scale human trials are underway. However there are considerable problems to be faced, particularly in ensuring that such vaccines are safe. Furthermore, although such vaccines may produce certain responses in the immune system these may not be the most suitable ones for fighting off HIV infection. TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 43 [Page 44](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/50?q1=directories) Attacking the virus Antiviral drugs One important approach to treating HIV infection is to attack the virus with antiviral drugs. By inhibiting the virus and preventing it from infecting new cells it is hoped that its harmful effects in the body will be minimised. The ideal antiviral drug would completely destroy the virus and any infected cells (i.e. it would be virucidal) without harming healthy, uninfected cells. In practice, no virucidal drug has ever been discovered for any viral disease. Viral infections are notoriously hard to treat, primarily because they establish a lasting infection within the cells of the body. In many viral diseases such as herpes, where the body is able to mount a relatively successful immune response, that immune response is able only to suppress the virus, keeping it inactive and preventing the recurrence of symptoms, rather than to eliminate it from the body. The only antiviral treatments currently available for any viral infection are virustatic i.e. they help to suppress the virus and keep it inactive, rather than killing it outright. Nevertheless, if HIV's activity could be entirely suppressed it is feasible that it would have no harmful effects on the immune system, and it might also be possible for the immune system to rebuild itself in people who have already experienced HIV-related immune damage. In theory, antiviral treatments could target any (or all) of the different stages in HIV's lifecycle. However, virtually all of the currently available anti-HIV drugs are designed to target the reverse transcription step. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors A unique characteristic of retroviruses such as HIV is their use of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. After HIV has attached itself to a human cell and released its genetic material (in the form of RNA) into the cell, reverse transcriptase uses the protein building blocks in the cell (nucleosides) to convert the viral RNA into a piece of DNA. Reverse transcriptase essentially works by looking in turn at each of the nucleoside blocks that make up the viral RNA and then using it as a sort of template to assemble a matching DNA chain of nucleosides from the supply in the cell. This chain is held together by chemical bonds between the individual component nucleosides. The piece of DNA is called the provirus. Another HIV enzyme called integrase then inserts this piece of viral DNA into the human DNA of the cell. One major class of reverse transcriptase inhibitors are the nucleoside analogue drugs. They include AZT, ddl, ddC, 3TC, stavudine and FLT. These compounds resemble the nucleosides found in the human cell. When reverse transcription occurs in the presence of one or more of these drugs, they disrupt the construction of the piece of proviral DNA. Instead of taking up a nucleoside from the supply in the cell, reverse transcriptase mistakenly uses the nucleoside analogue drug instead. Because the form of these drugs is slightly different from that of natural nucleosides, they do not form the necessary chemical bonds with natural nucleosides that would hold together the DNA chain. Consequently the DNA chain is left incomplete and because HIV has no mechanism for correcting such 'mistakes' the process of viral replication is irrevocably interrupted. However, this mechanism of action also accounts for the main drawback of this family of drugs. Because they resemble the building blocks of DNA, there is also a risk that they will be taken up when healthy human cells reproduce and will prevent the production of new cells. However, researchers are confident that while reverse transcriptase has a relatively high affinity for the nucleoside analogues (i.e. it is quite likely to take up the drug and interrupt reproduction in HIV-infected cells), the equivalent human enzyme, called DNA polymerase, has a low affinity for the drugs. This means that in uninfected cells, the presence of nucleoside analogue drugs is relatively unlikely to halt the reproduction. Moreover, unlike HIV, human cells have 'repair' enzymes which are designed to correct mistakes in DNA production during the normal reproduction of human cells. Nevertheless, drugs such as AZT do have side-effects which have been attributed to damage to the DNA of healthy cells. Muscle wasting (myopathy) associated with AZT can often be identified by the so-called ragged red appearance of damaged muscle fibres. Fast-replicating cells such as those in the bone marrow may also be inhibited by AZT, resulting in haematological side-effects such as anaemia and neutropenia. Acyclic and carboxylic nucleoside analogues are related drugs, but they are still at a very early stage of research. They have however shown equivalent in vitro efficacy to that of AZT with a longer time of action and also an added activity against herpes viruses. Examples include phosphonylmethoxyalkyl derivatives such as PMEA. Researchers have also developed a number of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). This class of drugs includes nevirapine, loviride and BHAP compounds. These drugs also inhibit the activity of reverse transcriptase, but not by acting as dummy building blocks as the nucleoside analogues do. In many cases the precise way by which they inhibit reverse transcriptase remains unknown. Other reverse transcriptase inhibitors include the licensed anti-CMV drug foscarnet. 44 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES [Page 45](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/51?q1=directories) Viral enzyme inhibitors Another possible target for antiviral therapy is HIV's integrase enzyme, which it uses to insert the proviral DNA into the host cell's DNA. To date, however, no integrase inhibitors have entered human trials. Once HIV has successfully infected a cell and inserted its genetic material into the cell's DNA, it may remain latent for a significant period of time. One of the factors that seems to affect whether or not the HIV genes become reactivated and begin to produce new viral particles is an HIV proviral gene called tat. This gene produces a protein (called Tat with a capital T) which greatly increases the growth efficiency of HIV. In test-tube studies, HIV-infected cells remain inactive and do not infect other cells if the tat gene is removed or inhibited. One line of research has therefore been to develop tat inhibitor drugs. Only one tat inhibitor - called Ro 24-7429 - has progressed into human trials, but has subsequently been abandoned after it showed little signs of efficacy but did have toxic side-effects. Enthusiasm for tat inhibitors has waned somewhat in the light of evidence suggesting that in some circumstances HIV may still be able to replicate efficiently even if Tat is inhibited. Some agents have been developed to target sites in the later stages of new virus particle production. Protease inhibitors act against the enzyme that HIV uses to break up large proteins into the smaller proteins from which the new viral particles are produced. New HIV particles produced in the presence of protease inhibitors are immature and non-infectious. Several protease inhibitors have entered human trials; the most advanced, saquinavir, has shown signs of significant antiviral activity on its own and in combination with AZT and with AZT and ddC. Very early laboratory research is working on the development of gag inhibitors that act against HIV's gag gene, which contains the genetic instructions for manufacturing a number of viral proteins. In one test-tube study, HIV treated with C-nitrose compounds was three to four times less able to infect new cells. (Nature, 4th February 1993). Preventing viral attachment Other experimental antiviral treatments aim to inhibit viral attachment. HIV can infect a previously uninfected human cell when a free virus particle uses the gpl 20 protein on its outer surface (envelope) to attach itself to a receptor of the outside of the human cell (usually the CD4 molecule), and then enter the cell. This binding mechanism presents two possible points of intervention to try to prevent the infection of new cells. First, it may be possible to block the CD4 receptor on human cells, thus preventing viral attachment. These experimental treatments include sulphated polysaccharides such as dextran sulphate as well as peptide T. Both of these bind to CD4. The alternative approach is to block gpl 20 using experimental treatments such as artificial versions of CD4 produced through recombinant (genetic engineering) technology. HIV-infected cells usually carry the gpl 20 protein on their cell membrane and this can also dock with receptors on uninfected cells, resulting in useless clumps of large numbers of CD4 cells called syncytia. Blocking gpl 20 might help to minimise the formation of these syncytia. Researchers have also tried using artificial CD4 molecules to selectively target poisons to HIV-infected cells, although this approach has recently been abandoned. One alternative approach to blocking the binding mechanism of HIV is to change the structure of gpl 20 and thus prevent it from fitting CD4 any longer. Researchers are trying to develop treatments called glycosylation inhibitors that prevent the normal formation of the sugars that make up the gpl 20 glycoprotein. In laboratory tests experimental treatments such as butyl DNJ and castanospermine have shown some promise in disrupting the assembly of gpl 20, but have significant side-effects. Researchers are working on modified versions of both these drugs. A related theoretical strategy is the use of lipid-based substances such as AL-721 to modify the liquidity of HIV's lipid membrane, making it harder for it to attach itself to human cells. Other anti-HIV strategies At the cutting edge of AIDS research, scientists are using antisense technology to develop new treatments. Antisense nucleotides are short pieces of nucleic acid which are specifically created to bind onto parts of HIV's genetic material and prevent them from fulfilling their functions. Only one antisense drug, called GEM 91, has entered early human trials; in the test-tube this drug binds onto part of HIV's messenger RNA and prevents the production of proteins from which new virus particles could be assembled. The final stage in HIV's lifecycle which can be targeted with antiviral therapies is when new virus particles (virions) are assembled at the surface of the infected cell, forming their envelope from the cell membrane studded with viral proteins before being released into the body. Hypericin may act as a budding inhibitor, as well as acting against reverse transcriptase. Alpha interferon has also been reported to inhibit the production and release of new virions. The mechanism of action of some anti-HIV drugs remains unknown. Compound Q is said to selectively inhibit HIV replication and to kill HIV-infected cells, although it has considerable toxic side-effects. There are also some experimental therapeutic approaches that aim to kill HIV directly. Extracorporeal photopheresis uses a combination of a drug and ultraviolet light; hyperthermia aims to kill the virus by heating up the blood; ozone is said to disrupt viral particles, as well as inhibiting reverse transcriptase and viral binding to human cells. None of these therapies has been clearly shown to have benefits for people with HIV and all run the risk of serious side-effects. TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 45 [Page 46](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/52?q1=directories) Combination antiviral therapy Most AIDS researchers and clinicians now believe that the most effective way of using anti-HIV drugs is likely to be in combinations. However, there are many potential combinations, but little research data on the effectiveness of combinations in practice. Moreover, the rationale for using combinations of drugs has evolved and developed over the last few years. In other fields of medicine, such as anti-bacterial and anti-cancer treatment, the use of several different drugs at the same time is commonplace. There are a number of reasons for using combinations: * Different drugs may work in different ways, or may attack a pathogen at varying stages of its lifecycle. Combining such drugs allows the cause of illness to be countered on a number of different fronts * In combination therapy, it may be possible to use lower doses of each drug than would be necessary to get the same treatment effect if only one drug was being given on its own. This may reduce the risk of side-effects from any of the drugs * Simultaneous treatment with a number of different drugs may make it harder for the pathogen to develop resistance to one or all of the drugs However, many of these reasons do not fully apply to the combinations currently being tested for treating HIV infection. First, the majority of the anti-HIV drugs which are currently available all act in the same way, by inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme. Few drugs that attack HIV at other points in its lifecycle, such as protease inhibitors, are yet ready for testing in humans. Secondly, combinations of AZT with ddl or ddC at present tend to use middle-range doses of each drug, rather than lower doses. Combinations of lower doses do also show synergistic effects in test tube studies (i.e. the antiviral effects of the combinations are greater than simply adding together the effects of the individual drugs). However, the Medical Research Council's Delta study uses the standard dose (600 mg/day) of AZT plus moderate doses of ddl and ddC, in an attempt to get good efficacy without serious side effects, and to make it possible to compare standard monotherapy with AZT (600 mg/day) with the combinations. Today, most researchers would agree that the main rationale for combination therapy is that combinations may pack a greater antiviral punch than single drugs and reduce the likelihood of HIV becoming resistant to treatment. It is not wise to use combinations of drugs which have similar side-effects. For this reason, combination therapy using both ddl and ddC is inadvisable, as both drugs can cause peripheral neuropathy. This is the same reasoning that may lead doctors temporarily to suspend AZT treatment for people who need ganciclovir for CMV disease, as both drugs can suppress the bone marrow. To date there is little evidence of the effectiveness of combination regimes. There is published data to show that 46 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES combinations do seem to be more effective than monotherapy in reducing viral load (the amount of HIV that can be detected in the blood). There have also been a number of small-scale studies that have shown that on average people who take the combinations of AZT plus ddl or AZT plus ddC experience larger and longer-lasting increases in their CD4 count than people taking AZT alone. In addition, a trial comparing alternating with combination AZT and ddl found that the simultaneous combination of the drugs resulted in markedly better CD4 count increases than alternating therapy. However, the significance of CD4 count changes in response to treatment is unclear. Several studies including the Concorde trial have found that the magnitude of CD4 changes does not necessarily predict clinical benefits such as fewer opportunistic infections or prolonged survival. Likewise it has still to be shown whether a reduction in viral load results in clinical benefits - this is a question that ongoing studies such as the Medical Research Council's Delta trial aim to answer. The only study to date which looked at the effects of combination therapy on such clinical endpoints was the American trial ACTG 155. This compared single-drug treatment (using AZT alone or ddC alone) with combination therapy (using AZT plus ddC). It recruited people with CD4 counts less than 300 who had already taken AZT for at least 12 months. The overall conclusion was that combination therapy was no more effective than monotherapy, but significantly more toxic. There were no additional benefits from combination therapy with AZT plus ddC, compared to monotherapy with ddC alone. Any advantage to combination therapy seemed to be limited to people with CD4 counts above 150. However, it is arguable that this trial was particularly unlikely to show substantial advantages to combination therapy because it enrolled people with relatively advanced HIV infection who had received prolonged prior AZT therapy. Other studies have suggested that the longer someone has taken AZT before starting AZT plus ddC combination therapy, the less their CD4 count may increase. It is likely that many participants may have developed AZT-resistant strains of HIV so that the AZT component of the combination was no longer of significant effect. In other words, it may be too much to expect combination therapy to have dramatic advantages for people who have already taken AZT for a long time, but combinations may be much more useful for people with little or no prior AZT. This is one of the questions which Delta should help to answer. Resistance to antiviral drugs Drug-resistant strains of HIV are ones that are able to withstand the effects of treatment drugs to which other (drug-sensitive) strains of the virus are susceptible. The development of resistance was first noticed with AZT. After a period of exposure to AZT, HIV in the body becomes resistant to the drug's effects. Resistance is caused by mutations in the virus' reverse transcriptase enzyme. AZT-resistant virus may be over 100 times less susceptible to AZT than unmutated or 'wild-type' strains. [Page 47](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/53?q1=directories) It is generally believed that the development of resistance may be one reason why the effects of AZT treatment appear to be lost after some months or years of treatment, although this has not been definitively proven. Some studies have suggested that the development of resistance does correlate with a decline in efficacy. In the trial ACTG 116B/11 7, people who had AZT-resistant strains of HIV at entry had a worse prognosis than people who AZT-susceptible strains, but this effect was seen regardless of whether they took AZT or switched to ddl. It is possible that the development of resistance is more a symptom of poor prognosis, perhaps due to factors such as an increase in viral replication for other reasons, rather than the cause of that poor prognosis. The development of resistance has now also been observed with most other anti-HIV drugs. Resistance developed particularly rapidly with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors when given on their own (as monotherapy). Resistance to protease inhibitors has also been observed. The only drug not to provoke resistance to date was the tat inhibitor Ro 24-7429, which has been discontinued because of lack of efficacy. Indeed, some researchers argue that the onset of resistance is a necessary consequence of treatment with an effective antiviral drug, because susceptible virus strains are inhibited and the Darwinian evolutionary pressure favours the survival of resistant strains. The only effective drug that is likely to be free from the problem of resistance is one that can rapidly and completely inhibit all viral replication. It is already clear that HIV is still able to develop resistance to the nucleoside analogue drugs even when they are given in combinations; the development of strains of HIV that are resistant to both AZT and ddl or both AZT and ddC - or even all three drugs - has been reported. However, it may take longer for resistance to develop, and high-level resistance may be less likely to occur, when anti-HIV drugs are used in combinations as opposed to single drugs used alone. The development of several different resistance mutations in reverse transcriptase (RT) can also have significant effects. If a person who has developed resistance to AZT next starts taking ddl, the RT gene may begin to mutate and develop ddl resistance. But the mutations which cause ddl resistance often appear to make the virus susceptible to AZT again. This suggests that if the virus is attacked with the combination of AZT and ddl, the development of resistance is likely to be slowed down. A somewhat similar effect is seen with the alpha-APA (non-nucleoside RT inhibitor) compound loviride: in test-tube studies, AZT-resistant HIV becomes susceptible to AZT again after treatment with loviride. Combination treatment with ddC and AZT appears not to prevent the emergence of AZT resistance; it is unclear whether the effectiveness of the AZT/ddC combination is affected if viral resistance to AZT is present. Another reason for the use of drugs in combination is that one drug may potentiate the effects of the other. For example, it is believed that ribavirin, a drug which may have, at best, very limited anti-HIV effects of its own, nevertheless may increase the anti-HIV effect of ddl when the two drugs are taken together. Convergent combination therapy In 1992-1993, laboratory research published by researchers in Boston seemed to turn many preconceptions about combination therapy upside-down. Until then, it was widely believed that the most effective way of using the currently available antiretroviral drug was likely to be in combinations of two or more different drugs which each act upon a different stage of HIV's lifecycle. For example, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor such as AZT might be combined with, say, a protease inhibitor or a tat inhibitor. The reasoning is that such combinations will attack HIV on a number of different fronts. However, the Boston group's research suggested that convergent combinations (i.e. combinations of drugs which all act upon the same stage of HIV's lifecycle) might offer the best hope for antiretroviral therapy. The researchers speculated that this strategy took advantage of HIV's tendency to mutate and become resistant to the effects of anti-HIV drugs, by using a combination of drugs to cause mutations which appeared to leave the virus unable to reproduce or infect new cells. The main piece of research into convergent combinations was a series of experiments by Yung-Kang Chow, a Harvard doctoral student. He described laboratory tests in which the combination of three anti-HIV drugs produced a series of four different mutations in the RT enzyme. HIV particles which developed this series of mutations after exposure to the drug combination appeared to be completely unable to replicate or to infect new human cells. This effect was observed with the convergent combinations of AZT, ddl and the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor pyridinone, which is also known as L-697,661. Similar promising results were also reported with AZT, ddl and the non-nucleoside nevirapine (sometimes called BI-RG-587), and with AZT, ddl and foscarnet. Foscarnet is an antiviral drug currently approved for use in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV). However the researchers subsequently wrote to the medical journal Nature to report that these experiments had been flawed and their conclusions about the potentially dramatic benefits of convergent combination therapy had been wrong. They had discovered that during their experiments, an extra fifth mutation which does not occur naturally had been introduced into the RT. It was this fifth mutation which had made the virus unable to replicate, and not the mutations produced by the convergent combination of drugs. This finding was confirmed by scientists from Wellcome, who found that when they created RT with the same series of four mutations caused by convergent combination therapy, the enzyme was still perfectly functional. The huge media attention to convergent combinations, and the expectations it raised, therefore stand as an example of the dangers of reaching premature conclusions from very preliminary research. Even before the error in the research was spotted, there was still no evidence that convergent combination therapy would be effective and safe in humans. TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 47 [Page 48](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/54?q1=directories) By contrast with the expectations raised by the convergent combination therapy hype, more recent research described experiments comparing the antiviral effects in vitro of a combination of four drugs which all act upon the same viral site (convergent combination) versus a combination of four drugs which all act upon different viral sites (divergent combination). The convergent combination did not appear to be more effective than the divergent combination. Although the original rationale for convergent combination therapy has now been shown to be flawed, there is still some reason to believe that using several anti-HIV drugs at once is likely to be more effective than using them one at a time. Research into combinations is therefore continuing. A large-scale American trial to evaluate AZT, ddl and nevirapine also considering new combination trial designs. One possibility would be to assess the benefits of adding a non-nucleoside drug to standard treatment with AZT, ddl or ddC. Another option is to measure the effects of various combinations on 'viral load' - the amount of HIV in the blood. The combination which caused the greatest reduction in viral load would be a prime candidate for testing in large-scale trials. Gene therapy Gene therapy is an approach to the treatment and prevention of inherited and acquired genetic diseases in which genes are artificially introduced into cells. These genes then use the cellular machinery to produce specific proteins that may selectively correct or alter disease conditions. Genes form part of DNA and act as the blueprint for all the physiological attributes of each individual. Each gene contains the information required to produce (or 'express') a particular gene product, usually a protein. Each cell contains thousands of different proteins with a range of different functions, such as forming the structure of the cell, controlling its growth, communicating with other cells and so on. It may only take one gene to malfunction and fail to produce its product correctly, or not produce it at all, for the cell's normal functions to be disrupted. This is turn may result in illness. Gene therapy allows the replacement of defective genes with properly functioning ones. It also allows new genes that would not normally be present in a cell to be inserted into it for therapeutic purposes. Thus, gene therapy can be used to insert a gene into a cell that will cause the cell to secrete a protein that will enhance or modulate the immune system's ability to recognize and fight a specific disease such as HIV infection. The most common way in which genes are inserted into new cells is by using a vector virus. Viruses have a natural ability to insert their own genetic information into the genetic information of the cells that they infect. By modifying the virus' genes, it is therefore possible to use the virus to insert the modified gene into the target cells. This stage is usually performed in a laboratory, and the infected cells are then transfused back into the patient, rather than injecting the virus into the body. The vector virus' own genetic material is usually also altered so that it cannot cause illness itself or spread to other cells within the body, unless this is intended. However, some gene therapy techniques do consist of injecting the vector virus (usually a modified mouse retrovirus) directly into the body. Once the vector virus has successfully inserted the therapeutic gene into the host cell, it becomes a permanent part of that cell and of any daughter cells that are produced from it by cell division. Biotechnology companies are still exploring other ways of introducing new genes into the cells of the body without using viruses. The only gene therapy for HIV that has entered trials uses a treatment called the Viagene HIV-1 immunotherapeutic. This is described in more detail in the A-Z of treatments. References Chang HE.

Boosting the immune system Immune modulators Quite apart from treatments designed to attack HIV directly, it may be possible to use treatments to boost the immune system - either in general against all infections and tumours, or against HIV specifically - and to try to correct the immune abnormalities seen in HIV infection. Immune modulators can be defined as substances which influence or modify one or more specific components of the immune system. There is considerable debate amongst scientists as to whether stimulating immune responses is a beneficial for HIV-infected people. Most immune stimulating treatments are called immune stimulators because they increase the proliferation (growth) of white blood cells called lymphocytes, which play a key role in identifying and eliminating infections. Lymphocytes are one of the main cell 48 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES [Page 49](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/55?q1=directories) types to be infected by HIV. Some scientists believe that stimulating lymphocytes may actually be harmful because it may result in the reproduction of HIV-infected lymphocytes, thus producing much larger numbers of HIV-infected lymphocytes in the body. At the very least, they argue that immune-boosting treatments should always be accompanied with anti-HIV treatments. However, there are many different types of lymphocytes, not all of which appear to become infected with HIV, and the effects of most immune stimulating treatments on different types of lymphocytes are unknown. The immune system is composed of many different elements. Not all of these are impaired in HIV-infected people. For instance, the ability to produce antibodies is not impaired, so if a substance is described as an immune booster due to its ability to stimulate antibody production this is unlikely to be of great benefit in HIV infection. Immune stimulation is a gamble that depends on knowing enough about how the immune system is damaged by HIV and other possible co-factors. At the moment not enough is known to understand what the knock-on effects may be when one component of the immune system is boosted. One theory about how HIV affects the immune system has suggested that in people with HIV there is a gradual loss of balance between different parts of the immune system. There are at least two different types of CD4 cell, known as T-helper 1 (TH I) and T-helper 2 (TH2) cells. TH1 cells are associated with cell-mediated immunity, triggering the T8 cells which attack invading organisms such as viruses directly. TH2 cells are associated with humoral immunity, triggering the production of antibodies -the proteins which attach to invading organisms and inhibit their proper function or signal their destruction. Recent studies have suggested that as HIV progresses towards AIDS there is a gradual shift from a TH1 immune response to a TH2 response. People who maintain a TH1 response may have a better prognosis and longer survival; in some individuals a strong TH1 response may also prevent infection and seroconversion despite exposure to HIV. However, critics of this theory say that the apparent switch from cellular to humoral immunity is simply a reflection of the gradual depletion of immune cells such as CD4, so that antibodies are left dominant. Many agents have been suggested as possible immune modulators and a few, such as alpha interferon, also have antiviral activity. However, they can be broadly divided into four categories: * cytokines * non-biological substances (such as drugs) * therapeutic (post-exposure) vaccines * anti-oxidants. Cytokines Cytokines are chemical messengers secreted by the cells of the immune system which act to coordinate and control the intricate workings of the immune system. Research into cytokine abnormalities is important in the understanding of how HIV causes illness and for the development of therapeutic strategies for treatment. There is evidence to suggest that part of the damage to the immune system in AIDS may be related to the interaction between HIV and cytokines. This can take two forms - HIV can disrupt the normal functions and levels of cytokines, and cytokines can stimulate HIV replication. Moreover, some of the clinical features in.HIV/AIDS such as weight loss, persistent fevers and diarrhoea may be due to elevated levels of cytokines. The typical pattern seen in people with HIV infection is that some cytokines are present at excessively high levels - these include IL-1, IL-4 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)while others such as IL-2 are present only at reduced levels. The therapeutic use of cytokines has therefore focused mainly on supplementing levels of cytokines which are deficient, and less commonly in trying to damp down those that are produced in excess. Researchers are also investigating whether cytokines that are known to have anti-viral or other anti-infection effects in the healthy immune system can be administered as treatments for people with HIV. These potential treatments include alpha, beta and gamma interferons. They are also testing whether the colony-stimulating cytokines G-CSF, GM-CSF and M-CSF, which boost levels of white blood cells, can help to correct low levels of those cells as a result of HIV infection or the side-effects of other treatment drugs. Non-biological substances A number of immune modulating drugs are under investigation. Only one, imuthiol or DTC, has yet entered large scale humans trials, and those found no clear evidence of benefit and even a possibility that it accelerated the development of AIDS. Some drugs are intended to reduce levels of cytokines that are abnormally high in people with HIV. Oxpentifylline is in clinical trials; this drug reduces levels of the cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which has been associated with wasting. Other drugs are thought to stimulate the immune system in different ways. Some such as DNCB are believed to cause a generalised immune activation. Therapeutic vaccines A vaccine is a substance intended to stimulate the body's own immune defences against a microorganism. While preventative vaccines are designed to protect the recipient against initial infection with a microorganism, therapeutic vaccines are designed for people who are already infected with the microorganism, with the aim of boosting or expanding their immune response against the microorganism. There are two main kinds of immune response. The first is the humoral immune response, which relies mainly on antibodies. In the case of HIV infection, the body produces antibodies which recognise and lock onto gpl 20, the viral protein on the surface of HIV particles and HIV-infected cells. By locking onto gpl 20, these antibodies may prevent the virus from binding onto human cells; they may also 'mark' the viral particles and infected cells for destruction by other elements of the immune system. TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 49 [Page 50](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/56?q1=directories) The other type of immune response is the cellular immune response, which relies mainly on the stimulation of T-cells which recognise HIV-infected cells and kill them. In the case of viral infections other than HIV, these T-cells (called cytotoxic T-cells or CD8 cells) are the most effective means of eliminating virally infected cells. However, in people with HIV, CD8 cells seem to disappear from the bloodstream as the illness progresses from symptom-free infection to AIDS. When the immune system is activated to respond to an antigen, some of the immune cells become 'memory' cells. Then, the next time an individual comes into contact with that same antigen, the existence of memory cells means that the immune system is primed to destroy it quickly, before it can establish a new infection in the body. This is why people who have recovered from an illness tend not to be susceptible to the same illness again. Vaccines contain either non-infectious fragments of microorganisms or whole microorganisms which have been killed or weakened so that they cannot cause disease. By introducing these into the body, the humoral and/or cellular immune responses are triggered and memory cells are produced. HIV therapeutic vaccines consist of either whole, killed HIV particles, or genetically engineered fragments of the virus. Trials have focused on the following HIV antigens: * gp160, the large protein which essentially forms the outer surface of HIV particles * gpl 20, the protein which forms part of the surface of the virus, with which HIV binds to the CD4 molecule on human cells * p24, a protein from the core of the virus Sp1 7, another core protein. Unlike some other immune boosting treatments, therapeutic vaccines aim selectively to activate the immune system against specific HIV proteins alone. Although individuals infected with HIV will clearly already have viral proteins in their bodies as a result of infection, the hope is that by presenting them to the immune system in a different way, the specific immune response may be augmented. For example, people bitten by rabid animals have been protected from developing rabies by inoculation with rabies virus particles. This gives theoretical grounds for optimism. There are a number of different ways of preparing the vaccine product and of delivering it into the body. For example, different gpl 20 vaccines have been prepared from different strains of HIV; it is unclear whether it would be most effective to try to match therapeutic vaccine treatment to the strain with which an individual is infected, or to use a different strain to try to stimulate broader immune responses. The genetically engineered proteins used in these products are mass-produced by growing them in yeast, insect or mammalian cells, which affects the form of the final vaccine. The different preparations also use various adjuvants, which are substances intended to increase the vaccine's effect, and may use various different vectors, which are other inactivated organisms such as vaccinia virus, canary pox or adenovirus which are used to transport the HIV fragments into the body. There is a theoretical risk that giving vaccine products to HIV-positive people could actually be harmful - by 50 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES stimulating the immune system, therapeutic vaccines could also stimulate viral reproduction in HIV-infected immune cells. However, early trials have shown that the therapeutic vaccines tested so far appear to be safe, at least in the short-term, in that they do not increase the rate at which the real HIV replicates, cause side-effects or actually suppress the immune system. They are also immunogenic, which means that laboratory tests show that they do stimulate humoral and cellular responses - although these responses may prove to be short-lived. In trials of gpl 60, these responses have been greatest in people with high CD4 counts (over 600). To date there is little or no evidence that these changes in antibody or CD8 cell levels also reduce levels of HIV replication or prevent further damage to the immune system, such as the loss of CD4 cells. There is also no evidence yet of clinical improvements such as fewer opportunistic infections or improved survival. Trials to date have been small, and only a few have been controlled trials from which truly reliable data can be obtained. However, much larger trials of therapeutic vaccines are due to start soon in the USA. Trials of therapeutic vaccines are also taking place in the UK. Several trials of the Oxford-based company British Biotechnology's p24.VLP product are underway or planned. Antioxidants Antioxidants are substances intended to control a biological phenomenon called oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a natural consequence of the use of nutrients by human cells. The molecules that make up cells contain pairs of electrons. These balanced pairs can be disrupted during the burning of energy in the cell, and single unpaired electrons will begin to fly around the body. These unpaired electrons will also attempt to steal paired electrons from other molecules, setting in motion a chain reaction. During this process much damage can be caused to the cell, including its genetic template, the DNA. Free radicals also damage the membrane of a cell, disrupting its absorption of nutrients and other functions essential to the health of a cell. Free radicals are like the sparks produced by a fire: random and dangerous, but inevitable. Most of these free radicals are mopped up by anti-oxidant substances like glutathione, vitamin E, vitamin C, beta carotene, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and various amino-acids. However, some bodily processes - like fighting infection - produce far greater quantities of free radicals than the body's anti-oxidant stores can cope with. Polluted air, water and food, cigarette smoke, recreational and treatment drugs are also potent sources of free radicals. Laboratory studies suggest that oxidative stress boosts HIV replication and in turn HIV replication boosts the production of free radicals, causing more oxidative stress. In particular, laboratory studies have shown that free radicals activate NF-kB, a cell protein which can trigger HIV to replicate where it has lain dormant in the cell's DNA. NF-kB production can be suppressed by some anti-oxidants. But when HIV genes become activated, levels of anti-oxidants in cells become drastically depleted as free radical production is stepped up. [Page 51](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/57?q1=directories) Until now almost all research has concentrated on the relationship between oxidative stress and HIV, but HIV is not the only factor to influence free radical production in people at risk of developing AIDS. Increased activity by neutrophils - white blood cells which fight bacterial and fungal infections - boosts levels of free radicals, as does chronic inflammation of tissues. Oxidative stress itself contributes to inflammation at many sites in the body, which then starts another cycle of free radical release. NF-kB also triggers cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to reproduce, setting off another cycle of damage, since both viruses can trigger dormant HIV as well as causing oxidative stress and disease in their own right. Sexually transmitted infections, repeated antibiotic use, recreational drugs such as poppers and poor nutrition also increase the likelihood of high levels of free radical activity. Free radicals have also been implicated in 'programmed cell death', a process which an increasing number of researchers see as the key mechanism by which T-cells are depleted in AIDS. Programmed cell death occurs when a T-cell takes the wrong cue from an antigen-presenting cell, which ought to alert T-cells to the presence of infections. When presented with an antigen in this way, a T-cell should take note of the antigen and become primed to proliferate and kill whenever it encounters that antigen in the future. Sometimes however T-cells do not respond. They become anergic (literally meaning that they have no energy) and the next time they encounter the antigen which triggered their anergic state, they commit suicide. This is programmed cell death. This process can be measured because it leaves cellular DNA chopped up in a very distinctive way. Researchers have noted that in people with HIV, a high level of apoptosis can occur which kills many T-cells even though they are never directly infected with HIV. The exact role of HIV in this process has still to be clarified. French researchers who have led the field in this area believe that free radicals play a key role in apoptosis. One theoretical approach to treatment for people with HIV is to try to boost levels of anti-oxidants in the body. One important anti-oxidant is glutathione (GSH) which is essential for the proper functioning of T-lymphocytes; it is thought to play an important role in cellular immune responses and prevent the activation of cells that are latently infected with HIV. Glutathione itself is very poorly absorbed as a supplement. Instead, many PWAs have used NAC, a cysteine precursor. The drug provides cysteine, which is converted into glutathione in the liver. Other popular anti-oxidants include Vitamin C (at high doses) and Vitamin A; because Vitamin A is toxic at high doses it is usually taken in the form of beta carotene which is safely broken down into Vitamin A in the body. Proponents of anti-oxidant use are all agreed that in the body anti-oxidants are likely to work most effectively when they are used in combinations. They also argue that anti-oxidants should be used in combination with treatments for specific conditions and with other agents which can support the immune system and reduce viral replication. Inhibiting infectious co-factors Cytomegalovirus Co-factors contribute to the development of illness. In HIV infection, it has been proposed that co-factors may increase the likelihood that a person with HIV will develop AIDS, or may worsen the prognosis for someone who has already been diagnosed with AIDS. Studies have suggested that the herpes virus cytomegalovirus (CMV) may act in concert with HIV. In a group of HIV-positive people with haemophilia at the Royal Free Hospital in London, those who were infected with both HIV and CMV developed symptoms significantly faster than those who did not have CMV. (However, more recent research at the Royal Free and other centres has cast doubt on this initial finding, and the role of CMV as a possible co-factor remains uncertain). There are theoretical grounds to believe that CMV and possibly other herpes virus may activate HIV-infected cells and increase HIV replication. This finding suggests that it may be beneficial to inhibit CMV and other herpes viruses with anti-herpes treatments. Several studies in which people with HIV have received high doses of the anti-herpes drug acyclovir have suggested that this treatment may prolong survival, at least in people with relatively advanced disease. Some researchers believe that this apparent benefit is due to the inhibition of herpes co-factors. Other than the herpes viruses there is no substantial evidence for infectious co-factors in HIV disease. For more on this subject see the section on cofactors in Immunity and disease and the subsection on sex in Protecting your health in daily life, below. TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 51 [Page 52](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/58?q1=directories) Preventing & treating opportunistic infections Opportunistic infections One of the most important components of an HIV/AIDS treatment strategy is the treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections. Opportunistic infections (Ols) are infections that take advantage of HIV-related damage to the immune system. Most Ols are caused by microorganisms that are common and may have lived in the body for many years. While the immune system is working properly, these microorganisms are prevented from growing or spreading within the body and causing disease. However, if the immune system is damaged by HIV (or other sources of immune suppression such as post-transplant treatment drugs) the microorganisms are able to reactivate and proliferate. In many cases, Ols can be effectively treated when they occur, although there are several for which adequate treatments do not exist. Prophylaxis It is also possible to prevent the occurrence of some Ols. In some cases it may be possible to avoid becoming infected with the organisms which cause illness. Taking care with food and drink, pet handling and safer sex and safer drug use may all prevent infection with potentially harmful organisms. See Protecting your health in daily life below for a detailed discussion of these precautions. However, these commonsense precautions cannot protect against the reactivation of microorganisms which may have been acquired a long time ago. Treatments to prevent the development of an infection are known as prophylaxis, from the Greek word meaning 'to guard against'. Primary prophylaxis simply means trying to prevent even a first occurrence of an opportunistic infection in someone who is likely to be vulnerable to it. It is quite well established that particular opportunistic infections usually only occur after a particular degree of immune damage has taken place, as measured by the CD4 cell count. This makes it possible to start particular prophylactic drugs when the CD4 count falls below certain levels. Secondary prophylaxis means trying to prevent a subsequent episode of an opportunistic infection after one episode has occurred. It is standard medical practice to provide 'maintenance therapy' to people who have already experienced certain opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, CMV of the eye or brain, toxoplasmosis or cryptococcal infection, to prevent a recurrence. Maintenance therapy usually consists of lower doses of similar drugs to those used to treat the active infection. Making a choice on primary or secondary prophylaxis is an individual decision made between people with HIV and their doctor. Targeting prophylaxis is also important. 52 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES No-one who feels entirely healthy will want to start taking prophylactic drugs until they are genuinely at risk. There is also a chance of resistance to drugs occurring if pathogens are exposed to those drugs over long periods. The choice of drug is also clearly important: some treatments for active opportunistic infections are too toxic to be given over the long periods needed for prophylaxis. Does prophylaxis work? There is good evidence that prophylaxis works. Compared with the earlier years of the epidemic, people with HIV are now less likely to develop PCP as a first AIDS diagnosis because of the widespread use of primary prophylaxis. Studies have shown that PCP prophylaxis, in combination with antiviral treatment, may itself increase survival times. In the 1990s, people with HIV who develop AIDS are tending to do so only when their CD4 count has fallen to a much lower level than in the past. This is presumably because antiviral treatment and the use of prophylaxis are delaying the opportunistic diseases that might otherwise occur earlier. Unfortunately prophylaxis is not always as effective once the CD4 count becomes very low, although it remains of value. The range of pathogens Many different pathogens can cause disease in people with HIV infection. Some are virulent, but most are harmless in people who are not immunocompromised. Cancers that occur in people with AIDS include those specifically characteristic of AIDS, such as Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), and others that commonly occur in people without AIDS as well, such as Non Hodgkin lymphoma. An individual's personal history as well as stage of HIV disease affects the spectrum of HIV-associated opportunistic diseases experienced. Opportunistic infections may be reactivations of previously controlled infections (eg. toxoplasmosis and cryptococcosis). Geography can also be significant; for example, histoplasmosis is common only in certain parts of the USA. Often, an opportunistic pathogen most commonly affects a particular organ system and causes a characteristic syndrome with a typical presentation; however, unusual and atypical presentations are becoming increasingly common. The opportunistic infections and tumours that may occur in HIV disease can be divided into the following categories: * protozoal infections * fungal infections * bacterial infections * viral infections [Page 53](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/59?q1=directories) * malignancies In addition, there are: * constitutional conditions directly associated with the effect of HIV itself. It is helpful to divide them up like this for two reasons. First, it makes it easier to understand the range of opportunistic conditions that may occur in HIV disease. Secondly it illustrates the potential for combined treatments or prophylaxes across a whole class of conditions. For example, treatment or prophylaxis for PCP, a protozoal infection, may also provide a measure of prophylaxis against other protozoal infections such as toxoplasmosis. Likewise, anti-fungal drugs may simultaneously prevent a whole range of potential fungal opportunistic infections such as candidiasis, cryptococcosis and coccidioidomycosis. A new drug that is effective against PCP, like atovaquone (566C80), may also be useful for other protozoal infections such as toxoplasmosis and Cryptosporidium. Protozoal infections * Coccidioidomycosis * Cryptococcosis * Histoplasmosis * a range of other less serious fungal infections such as athlete's foot, tinea, seborrhoeic dermatitis etc. * * Shigella * Streptococcus pneumonia * Tuberculosis * urinary tract infections Viral infections * Cytomegalovirus * Epstein-Barr virus * Herpes simplex * Human multifocal virus Malignancies Hodgkin's disease * Kaposi's sarcoma * Non Hodgkin lymphoma Constitutional conditions * HIV encephalopathy (or AIDS dementia) * Wasting syndrome TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 53 [Page 54](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/60?q1=directories) Complementary and alternative therapies Introduction This section is intended to provide an introduction to the contribution that complementary and alternative therapies can make to the treatment strategies of HIV-positive people. In recent years there has been some debate about the terms that should be used to describe the therapies covered in this directory. We have used the phrases complementary and alternative simply to describe how the therapy is used in relation to Western/orthodox medicine: either to assist or to replace it. We have used the term holistic to describe an approach to the patient which takes into account the mind, body and spirit in explaining the source of illness, making a diagnosis and offering treatment. Any form of medicine can be practiced in a holistic way. Complementary and alternative medicine is often described as holistic medicine, but orthodox medicine can be practiced in a holistic way too. The holistic approach to health and disease is one which pays attention to the role which the mind, body, spirit and emotions have in the development of illness and in healing. Different perspectives on health and disease One of the misgivings which many people have about complementary and alternative medicine concerns the differing views of the human body and the sources of disease on which such therapies are based. Such views often strike people as mystical and lacking in any solid scientific basis. The chief difference between conventional and alternative forms of medicine is the notion of 'energy' or 'life-force', a concept that is alien to Western medicine because it is unmeasurable. Scientific methods cannot detect the meridians of qi in Chinese medicine, the auras detectable by healers or the active agent in a highly diluted homoeopathic remedy, but large numbers of practitioners and patients are untroubled by this problem and continue to use these therapies successfully. All these forms of energy are taken for granted in alternative forms of medicine, and it has been argued that Western scientific methods are only just beginning to get to grips with these concepts as the fields of quantum physics, chaos and complexity theory begin to develop new ways of thinking about energy and matter. It can also be puzzling to encounter so many different explanations of the way in which the human body works and its ailments relieved. Acupuncturists look for signs in the pulses and the tongue and then place needles in points 54 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES which from a doctor's point of view have nothing to do with the place where the pain is present. Reflexologists seek to relieve problems by using the feet as a key to identifying the body's ailments. Homoeopaths use minute doses of medicines which should not, by all the laws of orthodox science, have any detectable effect on the human body. In recent years there has been a great deal of debate over the ways in which the validity of alternative forms of medicine can be proved, as demand increases amongst patients for the availability of complementary therapies through the NHS. Doctors may still say that until the safety and effectiveness of therapies are proved they are not happy to refer patients to complementary therapists and remain uncertain of the potential benefits to their patients. The lack of research Orthodox scientific methods and orthodox medicine have developed alongside each other over hundreds of years. Painstaking observation, experimentation and deduction have been the mainstays of the scientific and medical tradition and they have given us an elaborate knowledge of the human body and its processes. Orthodox scientific methods have developed very rigorous standards for proving that treatments work, that organisms cause disease and that if patients recover or become sicker it is as a consequence of the treatment rather than some other factor. Research is now beginning to develop into the complementary and alternative therapies with a view to proving their effectiveness. Although complementary and alternative medicine has been labelled anti-scientific by some critics, it is not by its nature opposed to scientific methods such as trials and rigorous observation. Some of these studies attempt to compare complementary treatments with orthodox treatments; others compare complementary treatments with a placebo. Wherever research of relevance to HIV-positive people has already been conducted, we have described it in the A-Z of therapies. The few trials which have been conducted into the efficacy of complementary treatments in HIV and AIDS have been conducted by individual hospitals, which means that they tend to be small studies. As a consequence, reports of these studies invariably conclude: \"More research is needed in this area to verify these results\". Unfortunately the chances of such research taking place on a large scale remains fairly small owing to the way in which treatment research is organised. It remains largely funded by drug companies, which have no financial incentive to invest in trials of non-pharmaceutical treatments which they cannot patent and make money from. Acupuncture, for instance, is a treatment which depends on the skill of the practitioner rather than the ingenuity of a chemist or a [Page 55](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/61?q1=directories) researcher for its success. Up to now, such research has been funded by public bodies or private trusts with very limited funds available for such work. Doctors are reluctant to undertake trials of complementary and alternative therapies because they do not use these therapies in their everyday practice and are unfamiliar with their methods. They would prefer to see complementary and alternative practitioners experienced in the use of a particular therapy conducting such studies. There is also considerable difference of opinion on the best way to conduct research into complementary and alternative therapies, and the best methods have still to be agreed upon. In such circumstances it is worth remembering that practitioners of complementary and alternative therapies can take steps to ensure that the benefits of their treatments are properly recorded. The Research Council for Complementary Medicine recommends that if practitioners wish to present evidence of the benefits of their treatment, they need to present basic evidence in the following way: Details of all patients treated. A case report which describes three successes in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma may omit to mention the five cases which weren't helped by the treatment. A report which says that twenty people are healthy after two years of treatment is not enough either. In order to judge the success of a treatment, it's necessary to know what point people started from. Did they have high CD4 counts at the start of the study, or did they have low CD4 counts indicating a high risk of opportunistic infections? A case report needs to give details of everybody treated in order to allow others to judge the success rate using this therapy. If patients don't come back, they need to be contacted and properly followed up too. Just because they fail to return, this should not be taken as a sign that the treatment has been successful. What treatment was given? It's not enough to say that patients were given acupuncture treatment, for instance. A case report needs to give details of the exact treatment, how often it was given and how long for. What were the results? Although it may be difficult to measure the outcomes without expensive equipment, it is possible to track the progress of patients through their medical records and through self-assessment. For instance, patients can be asked to define on a 1 to 10 scale their sense of well-being, level of energy, level of pain or severity of other symptoms at each visit. The Research Council for Complementary Medicine is able to advise on research in this field. The Immune Development Trust is planning research into holistic treatments in HIV, AIDS, cancer and multiple sclerosis. It is planning to develop a research protocol which can be used in research into complementary therapies. Mind and Body Many people with HIV say that they have gained great benefit, either in terms of symptom relief or improved quality of life and enhanced sense of well-being, from therapies which use the mind to influence the body, or which relax the mind. These include meditation, autogenic training and visualisation. The mechanisms through which the nervous system, conscious and unconscious thoughts and emotions influence immune responses are being unravelled by researchers who describe their field of study as psychoneuroimmunology - the study of the relationship between the mind, the nervous system and the immune system. Stress signals are transmitted through the body by several pathways, using neurotransmitters and hormones. Alterations in levels of these hormones and neurotransmitters govern the way in which the body responds to the stressful event. The short-term stress response - the 'fight or flight' response - is our basic response to danger, and prepares us to act quickly. Increased energy is supplied to the brain, the heart and the muscles, the heart beat speeds up, and sweating increases in order to cool the body. This alarm response is short-term and eventually wears off, so other mechanisms come into play to deal with more prolonged episodes of stress. Cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal gland, increases blood sugar levels so that more energy is available. Cortisol also reduces the activity of white blood cells essential in fighting infection. If this stress response becomes repetitive and chronic, it can reduce the ability of the adrenal glands to manufacture the hormones needed and eventually place a strain on the heart, the arteries and general immunity. There is also some evidence that attitudes to illness play a role in determining the course of an illness. In 1993 The Lancet published the findings of American research into Chinese-Americans' beliefs about their prognosis following diagnosis with cancer. The study was designed to investigate whether beliefs about illness might affect survival. In Chinese folklore, the year of birth is linked with one of five elements: earth, fire, water, metal or wood. Each element is linked to an organ system and its diseases, so that fire is linked with heart diseases and earth with tumours, including cancer. In China it is thought that people born in earth years are especially susceptible to cancer. The study compared Chinese-Americans diagnosed with the same types of cancers at the same time, and found that those who knew that they had been born in unfavourable earth years tended to die months or even years before those born in other years. Those Chinese-Americans born in earth years also died more quickly than non-Chinese Americans born in earth years. The same was true of heart disease patients born in fire years and those with chest diseases born in metal years. This study suggests that widely held beliefs about the course of an illness can become self-fulfilling prophecies. The effect of positive thinking and personality on the course of illness is disputed amongst researchers, but all researchers are agreed upon the power of the human mind to cause physical responses to what it believes to be an TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 55 [Page 56](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/62?q1=directories) effective treatment. Scientists call this effect the placebo effect, and a placebo is used in many clinical trials in order to determine whether there is a greater response to a treatment which contains an active drug than there is to an inactive imitation drug. Sometimes placebo effects can be quite startling. In one controlled study by the British Stomach Cancer Group, 30% of the placebo group lost their hair and 56% of the group suffered nausea or vomiting, all side-effects expected to result from chemotherapy. This suggests that belief in the effectiveness of the treatment can produce the positive and negative effects associated with that treatment and that belief - or disbelief - in treatments can produce powerful effects. This may be one reason why some people are so angered by those who question their choice of treatment or produce information which questions the effectiveness of that treatment. The effects of some complementary and alternative therapies are dismissed by critics as 'just a placebo effect'. However, if complementary and alternative therapies do on occasion produce benefits purely through the power of suggestion, this is an effect worthy of further investigation rather than dismissal. The link between the mind and body is seen as crucial to self healing by many holistic practitioners, since each influences the other. Holistic practitioners say that healing emotional problems makes a crucial contribution to healing physical problems, and that emotional disorders can lead to illness. Stress and relaxation Complementary and alternative therapies are sometimes dismissed as 'merely' providing stress relief, as if this wasn't a significant benefit to people with compromised immune systems. Yet as the previous sections show, stress plays an important role in illness, and even if the benefits of a therapy only amount to stress reduction, the therapy is still providing something which is not available on prescription from your doctor. Therapies such as massage, acupuncture, aromatherapy and t'ai chi all have the effect of relaxing the body and the mind. Massage, for instance, reduces levels of cortisol, a hormone connected to stress responses, and some forms of massage may increase levels of naturally occurring opiates. Stress reduction techniques such as autogenic training, meditation and hypnotherapy work by using the mind to relax the body. All these techniques have been shown to improve health problems and lead to an enhanced sense of well-being. Exercise also relaxes the body and reduces stress. In particular, regular aerobic exercise increases the supply of endorphins in the brain and the body, improving mood. The process of consulting a complementary or alternative practitioner may in itself help to reduce the stress of a diagnosis. Many people say that they find the amount of time given by a therapist in itself makes them feel calmer and more able to cope with their symptoms and the implications of their diagnosis. The beneficial effects of 56 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES feeling that someone is taking care of you should never be underestimated. Choosing & using a therapy You don't have to be seriously ill to use a therapy. Many people use therapies in order to maintain good health and a sense of well-being in the same way as they have incorporated exercise and diet into their everyday lives. For many people, using complementary and alternative therapies have enriched their quality of life and opened up new perspectives on the world. Many people say that using a complementary or alternative therapy has helped their physical, mental, emotional or spritual well-being at different stages in their lives. In order to know whether you want to use a therapy it may be helpful first of all to do a general health assessment. In this you should take stock of both your physical and emotional state of being. What physical problems do you want to relieve? What emotional problems do you want to deal with? Holistic therapy is as much concerned with the mind and the emotions as it is with the body. Think about yourself, your relationships with other people and your ability to manage stress. It may be useful to talk to a friend or a counsellor and identify sources of stress and dissatisfaction in your life. You may already have a feeling as to whether therapeutic interventions might be of use. It's important to consider your emotional symptoms alongside the physical symptoms. You may find that stressful situations simply can't be avoided. If you feel distressed or unable to cope with a physical problem, you may find that a complementary therapy has as much to offer in terms of enabling you to feel calmer and more able to cope as it does in terms of symptom relief. You may find that you simply have more energy to look after yourself. Taking care of yourself is often an important part of the healing process. The appropriate therapy Your choice of therapy may be influenced by a number of factors. Is the therapy available in your area? Will you have to pay for it, or is a concessionary scheme available? Is this form of therapy something I am likely to feel comfortable with? Some people are scared of needles for instance; this may make acupuncture a daunting prospect. Other people may find the prospect of being touched by another person during a massage quite unsettling. For others, a treatment such as homoeopathy, which superficially resembles conventional drug treatment, may seem less unfamiliar than other forms of complementary or alternative treatment. You may have particular needs which are not directly related to HIV infection. For instance, you may be an addict. If this is so, you may want to find out what particular therapies have to offer in terms of the treatment of addiction, helping the process of withdrawing from drugs [Page 57](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/63?q1=directories) or coping with anxiety and stress after withdrawal from drugs. In London the CORE Trust can provide information on the holistic treatment of addiction and the HIV-related problems of drug users, and a number of centres serving drug users offer complementary therapies in conjunction with the Immune Development Trust. There is also an NHS traditional Chinese medicine clinic in South London which specialises in the treatment of HIV infection, alcoholism and addiction, called the Gateway Clinic. For further details of all these services, see the Contacts section. If you already have one or two therapies in mind then begin looking into those therapies more deeply before you schedule any appointments. Have a look at the A-Z section in this guide if you don't know what a specific therapy might have to offer. Seek out any relevant information. Learn more about HIV/AIDS and orthodox treatments. This will give you more knowledge with which to judge the claims being made about certain therapies and hopefully allow you to make informed treatment choices. Imagine yourself to be a scientific researcher. Do not prejudge or censor information. Try to be objective and stay open to all the options. Become your own expert as you utilize those around you, your friends, other people with HIV, consultants and practitioners. Read the reports on trials, research and statistics. Listen and observe. Note down any information you collect, accompanied by your impressions and feelings on any implications this has for you. Evaluate information. All too often we hear reports of cures or healing achievements, or we hear complementary and alternative therapies dismissed as a confidence trick or even a dangerous fraud. In such circumstances, we need to know to how to establish an unbiased opinion, and where to go for information to help us make up our minds. See Evaluating new treatments for more tips on doing your own research and making up your own mind. Clarifying your aims What are you hoping to gain from a complementary or alternative therapy? The following is a list of possible benefits. Remember that complementary and alternative therapies can meet some of these aims but not neccessarily all of them for any individual. Reducing stress and improving psychological health Many forms of complementary therapy are excellent ways of reducing stress, and often have knock-on benefits such as an increased sense of well-being, greater confidence to make changes in lifestyle and an enhanced sense of control over one's life. Pain relief Some forms of complementary therapy may provide very effective pain relief. Acupuncture is one example of a therapy with a good record of relieving certain sorts of pain. Treating secondary opportunistic infections Many less serious infections can also be controlled with complementary forms of treatment, some of which have been tested and shown to be just as effective as standard drug treatments. Fungal infections, skin problems and night sweats are an example of the problems which herbalists, acupuncturists and homoeopaths say they have considerable success in relieving. Preventing opportunistic infections It is difficult to prove that any forms of complementary or alternative medicine prevent opportunistic infections because studies have not been done to compare people who receive orthodox medication with those who use alternative treatment regimes such as naturopathy. Complementary and alternative practitioners say that by improving the overall level of health of an individual, their treatment may enhance immunity and reduce the likelihood of opportunistic infections. Any doctor will routinely take the view that to abandon practices such as prophylaxis against PCP with drugs such as Septrin or aerosolised pentamidine is extremely ill-advised. Treatment to replace conventional medication which is not effective and/or too toxic Practitioners, unless medically qualified and in charge of your treatment, should not be recommending you to come off any prescribed drugs. You are of course ultimately responsible for any decisions you take regarding your health care, but if you decide to stop taking a drug you should consult your doctor first. A significant minority of HIV-positive people nevertheless think that conventional medications may be doing more harm than good. For example, there is widespread resistance to the use of drugs such as AZT because of possible severe side-effects (which tend to occur more frequently in people who are already symptomatic). Many people turn to complementary and alternative forms of medicine because they distrust the side-effects of conventional medications and believe alternative medicine to be natural and non-toxic. Some forms of complementary and alternative medicine are certainly very safe, but others need to be used with caution. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine for instance employs some herbs which may cause liver problems, so it is important that you continue to receive regular monitoring through your doctor whilst receiving such treatment. Boosting the immune system Although many claims are made for the capacity of complementary and alternative treatments to boost the immune system, much of the evidence is sketchy and confined to laboratory studies or very small trials, so embarking upon the use of some substances or therapies in the hope that they will lead to major health improvements is a significant act of faith. See Evaluating new treatments for more discussion of this issue. Nevertheless there are numerous anecdotal reports of people who show impressive improvements in health, CD4 counts, reduced levels of virus and quality of life after using combinations of alternative treatments in combination with some conventional medications. TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 57 [Page 58](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/64?q1=directories) Problems to consider Your expectations should never be unrealistic. Can this therapy relieve your symptoms or help you cope with them? Can your quality of life improve? Beware of pressures and promises that push a picture of the truth or a dramatic cure. A good therapist will not tell you what to do. They will encourage you to take responsibility for your life. They can help to facilitate what you want to achieve by supporting you in making your own choices. Some therapies may have side-effects, such as making you feel drowsy for the next day or two. Others such as acupuncture or homoeopathy can cause temporary fluctuations in energy. Aromatherapists may recommend that you keep out of the sun after using some oils. Are there any side-effects to the therapy you are considering? Some therapies should not be used if you suffer from certain conditions. For example, if you have varicose veins, lymphatic drainage massage should be avoided. Some aromatherapy oils should be avoided during pregnancy. Autogenic training is not recommended for people with epilepsy. Check such contra-indications before choosing any therapy. People often have fears about a therapy. You may have heard things which make it seem like a difficult undertaking. Typical reservations about complementary and alternative therapies include: it will demand too much of a change in my life; nobody can really help me except doctors; I don't want to start relying on others; I might have to talk about my feelings with strangers; will I seem weak if I can't stick with it? These feelings are not unusual, but most people find that they recede once they begin to learn about the therapy. If you have any reservations before beginning a therapy, talk to a friend or discuss your reservations with the therapist. Begin the therapy with an agreement to have a few sessions to check out what the experience is like for you. Conventional and complementary therapies Most HIV-positive people who use complementary or alternative forms of medicine do so whilst also receiving orthodox forms of treatment. For example, you may choose to take AZT whilst also taking vitamin supplements in the belief that these may reduce the side-effects, and employing a number of stress reduction therapies such as massage, aromatherapy and meditation alongside these options. Another example is someone who is not receiving any anti-retroviral drug treatment, but who is receiving prophylaxis against PCP whilst also using Chinese herbal treatments for possible immune enhancing effects and treatment of symptoms such as thrush. A third example is someone who has been receiving chemotherapy for KS along with anti-retroviral drug treatment, and who is suffering from peripheral neuropathy. This person is also using massage and 58 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES aromatherapy with the aim of relieving the pain in the hands and feet caused by the neuropathy. Virtually everyone using complementary and alternative therapies has constructed their own programme, which often requires doing some research but ultimately trying things out to see if they prove beneficial. Informing doctors and therapists If you have decided to include complementary therapies in your health care, a good working relationship with a doctor can maximise the benefits you get from therapies. Your doctor will be able to monitor your progress and advise you of current medical opinion on drug treatment. Being open about the therapies you are using and establishing a good understanding with your doctor about the part these therapies play in your health care cuts down the amount of stress you face. Of course some doctors may have a negative response to your use of complementary and alternative therapies. This may be because the doctor has not had time to research the therapy fully enough to support you in that choice, so presenting the fruits of any research you have done on the therapy you have chosen may help to improve understanding between you. However, you should also be prepared to listen to your doctor's doubts as part of the process of gathering information about the therapy. If you decide to use a therapy or treatment despite your doctor's scepticism, there are three possible outcomes. If you benefit from the therapy, your positive experience may make your doctor more open to such an approach in the future. You may simply agree to differ, but this can be stressful, especially if you need support whilst ill or wish a therapist to visit you in hospital. Or you may decide to change your doctor, if you have a choice of potential doctors in your area. When combining complementary treatments with orthodox treatment, it is important to keep both your doctors and your complementary practitioners informed of the treatments which you are receiving, in order that any possible adverse effects of these treatments can be taken into account when diagnosing symptoms. For instance, there is a chance that interactions may occur between orthodox drug treatments and herbal treatments which you are using (even herbal treatments you buy for yourself). It can be sometimes be difficult to tell your doctor that you are using complementary therapies if you have heard your doctor expressing negative views about the therapy. It may also seem difficult to tell a therapist that you are continuing to using conventional medications when you have heard that therapist express disapproval of that drug treatment. A good therapist will respect your personal choice, although he or she may present additional information to explain why the drug might be harmful. It may be that you were not fully informed of possible side-effects, or that you did not take responsibility for finding out yourself what the effects of a drug might be. Remember that whilst some complementary and alternative therapists take the view that orthodox medications may at times contribute to illness, you [Page 59](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/65?q1=directories) do not have to adopt this view in order to gain benefits from complementary therapies. Decide each case on its merits, and be prepared to re-assess your ideas. Demand to see proof of the alleged adverse effects of any drugs - it is just as easy to make an uninformed choice about rejecting medication as it is to make an uninformed choice about using it. Achieving your goals Monitor and assess your progress with any therapy or combination of therapies. It is a good idea to keep a separate diary noting drug dosages, holistic treatments, dietary changes, exercise routines, and most importantly, how you feel physically, emotionally and mentally. Such a diary may also reveal factors that affect your changes in mood and how you're feeling, such as not sleeping well after meals, or an increase in energy levels following certain exercises or dietary changes, or even that particular sorts of relationships leave you feeling confident and loved. Later on, this diary can form a basis for a more objective and accurate review of things which have worked for you when making health care decisions. Recall your original aims upon beginning the therapy and note what you have achieved physically and emotionally. Ask yourself what you feel better about. Notice too what you have not accomplished and how you feel about that. Perhaps your original goals were unrealistic or now seem irrelevant. Perhaps there are things you would still like to deal with. How might you approach that? Explore your reactions to leaving the therapy. Endings stir up complicated feelings in all of us. Your therapist/practitioner is a human being with whom you have develope a special relationship. You may be more emotionally dependent on your therapist than you had realised. Complete your therapy. Tie up any loose ends. Check to see if there's anything to do or say before or during your last session. You might want to review what has happened during your therapy with your practitioner. Finally, say goodbye! Evaluating new treatments or therapies It can be very difficult to judge the claims which are being made about a new treatment. Unlike conventional medical treatments which tend to be sponsored by drug companies and go through a well-defined process before the drug becomes widely available through the clinic which you attend, complementary and alternative treatments and forms of medicine may come to your attention by completely different routes. The commonest routes are through friends who have already tried the treatment or through the testimony of HIV-positive people who believe themselves to have benefited from a treatment. Another route is through alternative medical and health publications, often magazines or newsletters which are not AIDS-specific and which may have little experience of evaluating AIDS treatments. New treatments may be offered by a complementary or alternative medical practitioner already using other methods to treat you, or your doctor may refer you to a practitioner. Past experience may also teach you when a particular treatment is likely to be useful. In all these cases, there are a number of factors to bear in mind when making your decision about whether to begin using this treatment or substance. This chapter also looks at issues to bear in mind when considering the use of drug treatments outside an orthodox setting. Anecdotal reports from friends Although a treatment may have been beneficial to a friend, there's no guarantee that it will benefit you in the same way. The sort of anecdotes which are particularly worthy of attention are those which involve clear improvements in a symptom following the use of a single treatment. If someone is using several different therapies it is unwise to attribute any health imrpvements to a single treatment. Be wary of anecdotal reports supplied by promoters of a treatment. Personal testimonies of benefits are often the only 'evidence' promoters of treatment can produce to substantiate their claims. There is good reason to be sceptical of the value of such reports. Studies published in peer-reviewed journals Although large-scale studies of alternative treatments are few and far between, smaller studies and laboratory studies are relatively easy to perform. This guide summarises information available from those studies, and the limited conclusions which can be drawn from those studies. If you come across treatments which are not listed in this guide, ask for information about studies which have been published in peer reviewed medical journals. It is very easy for people to make claims about treatments and to report those claims in such a way that they seem scientifically credible. It's much more difficult to do that when the report is reviewed by other doctors or practitioners who understand the field. Alternative medical journals exist which have a peer review process and which publish scientific reports and studies of a high standard. These include the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine, many journals of Chinese medicine and acupuncture, and journals of herbal medicine and plant pharmacology. If a practitioner claims that a study 'shows' that a treatment works, ask to see a copy of the study. In our experience, practitioners often draw unwarranted conclusions from research. For instance, many fail to make the crucial distinctions between a case report and a trial, and between controlled and uncontrolled trials. A case report is simply an observation. It is a report of what happened to a group of people who received a particular treatment. Such a report can often suggest trends, but it doesn't provide the standard of proof needed to say confidently that any improvement in health was due to the treatment in question. The case report may fail to explain what happened to the people who dropped out of the study TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 59 [Page 60](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/66?q1=directories) and it may use average CD4 counts to claim benefits, despite the fact that averages can easily be skewed by one exceptional result. These are common faults of case reports in this field. In order to prove benefit, a doctor or practitioner needs to conduct a trial. This should attempt to assemble a large group of people whose characteristics reflect the diversity of people affected by the condition. A large number of participants protects against the possibility that the results of the trial could be due to chance, and the trial should have exclusion criteria to ensure that all the participants are comparable and that some aren't using treatments which could skew the results. The trial report will also use statistical methods to demonstrate whether the results are 'statistically significant' or whether they could simply be due to chance. A trial may test a treatment or therapy against a placebo, or against a standard treatment with a success or failure rate that is well known, or against an untreated control group. In all these cases it is possible to judge whether the therapy or treatment is better than the standard treatment, or whether it is harmful. Clarifying what the treatment is In cases where you are being advised to take something such as a drug or herbal compound, make sure you know what it is. This may sound obvious, but some of the worst charlatans still claim that they can't reveal all the ingredients of their treatment because they must protect their treatment from greedy drug companies. In truth, it's easy to patent a treatment and thus protect it from theft. If something is being kept from you, how can you make an informed decision about what to put into your body? The price of the treatments Many of the alternative treatments described in this guide are not available through the NHS. Although many practitioners who treat large numbers of HIV-positive people have concessionary schemes, some do not. You may be able to get help from voluntary organisations to help pay for the treatment. Many of the standard drugs used to treat HIV and AIDS-related illnesses are hugely expensive. Drug companies justify these prices by citing the high cost of drug development and research. How does an alternative practitioner justify exorbitant prices? If a treatment is very expensive, ask careful questions about it. Interview the promoter If the treatment is being promoted by one individual, check them out. Complementary and alternative therapies are almost always offered by individuals who are members of professional associations, but if you find that a new treatment is being offered by someone who is not either attached to a hospital or an association of professional therapists, it is advisable to ask further questions. What degrees do they have, and where from? If they claim to have a PhD in microbiology from Harvard University, check it out. A few pounds in phone calls and postage could save you thousands of pounds and lot of disappointment and suffering. Ask what papers they have published and where they have worked in the past. Ask other practitioners or doctors in the field for their opinion on the claims being made by the promoter. Claims based on natural and non-toxic qualities Just because a substance is an organic plant extract, it doesn't mean it's non-toxic. Plants produce very potent poisons, or they may be contaminated with toxins such as lead. The plant may also contain chemicals which interact with other treatment drugs you are taking. A qualified herbalist will be able to warn you of this possibility. Plants may indeed be non-toxic if used in the right way, but inexperienced prescribing or overdosing can lead to violent adverse reactions. In Chinese herbal medicine, prescriptions will sometimes contain toxic herbs with anti-viral and anti-carcinogenic properties which can only be taken in combination with other herbs to reduce those toxicities. Taking such a herb on its own is dangerous. Vitamins are often claimed to be a non-toxic supportive treatment, but taken in large enough quantities, virtually any vitamin or mineral can cause harm. See Nutrition and vitamins for further details. Claims of boosting the immune system The immune system is composed of many different elements. Not all of these are impaired in HIV-positive people. For instance, the ability to produce antibodies is not impaired, so if a substance is described as an immune booster due to its ability to stimulate antibody responses, this is unlikely to be of great benefit in HIV infection. There is considerable debate amongst scientists as to whether stimulating immune responses is a beneficial thing in HIV-infected people. Most immune stimulating treatments are called immune stimulators because they increase the proliferation of white blood cells called lymphocytes, which play a key role in identifying and eliminating infections. Lymphocytes are one of the main cell types to be infected by HIV. Some scientists believe that stimulating lymphocytes infected with HIV to proliferate by cloning themselves may lead to much larger numbers of HIV-infected lymphocytes in the body. However, there are many different types of lymphocytes, not all of which appear to become infected with HIV, and the effects of most immune stimulating treatments on different types of lymphocytes are unknown. Immune stimulation is a gamble that depends on knowing enough about how the immune system is damaged by HIV and other possible co-factors. At the moment we don't know enough to understand what happens when one component of the immune system is boosted. What knock-on effects will this have? Ask exactly what evidence exists of the immune stimulating potential of this treatment and how it might stimulate the immune system. Ask what evidence exists about the health of people with HIV who have used this treatment for long periods. Talk to a doctor with a good knowledge of immunology, or do your own research. If you decide to use treatments which have an immune stimulating effect, make sure that you continue to undergo regular monitoring by your doctor. If these tests show increasing levels of virus, this suggests either that the treatment is having no effect on preventing viral replication, or that it is actively stimulating replication. 60 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES [Page 61](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/67?q1=directories) Further reading Healing AIDS Naturally Laurence Badgeley (Human Energy Press, 1988) AIDS and the Healer Within Nick Bamforth (Amethyst, 1993) Written by an HIV-positive man who has worked as a healer with HIV-positive people for nearly ten years, this book provides meditations for those who want to cultivate their inner healing potential. Magic or Medicine: An Investigation into Healing Robert Buckman & Karl Sabbagh (Channel Four/Macmillan, 1993) An excellent critical examination of the claims of complementary and alternative medicine.

Protecting your health in daily life Safe and healthy living Many people with HIV choose to make changes to their lifestyle in order to try and avoid exposure to potentially harmful microorganisms. Such microorganisms may cause illness themselves or alternatively they may cause the HIV infection itself to worsen either by activating the immune system and thereby increasing HIV activity or by acting as co-factors. This section looks at the following 'lifestyle' issues and what risks they pose: * Hygiene * The water supply * Food poisoning * International Travel * Vaccinations and immunisations Guidelines for good hygiene Generally, hygiene precautions need not be different for people with AIDS than for anyone else. This is because most of the opportunistic infections associated with HIV are not ones you 'catch' from the environment. For instance, people with AIDS are no more or less vulnerable to the common cold than anyone else. A few simple guidelines cover most eventualities: * Washing carefully with soap and hot running water is always the most important element in any aspect of good hygiene * Wear strong rubber gloves and use very hot water and strong disinfectants when cleaning up or dealing with anything messy, like gardening, manure, diarrhoea, rubbish, blood, etc * The hot cycle of washing machines successfully cleans all kinds of dirty fabrics * Make sure you use different cleaning cloths for kitchen and bathroom * If you have cuts on your skin, wash well under running water, encourage a bit of bleeding to flush out any germs, clean the cut with antiseptic and put a waterproof plaster over it TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 61 * Sex * Drug use * Smoking * Poppers * Factor VIII use [Page 62](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/68?q1=directories) * With any deep cuts it is always best to get medical attention * Do not to share toothbrushes or razors * Avoid cuts by disposing of sharp objects carefully There are some other circumstances where it is worth taking extra precautions. Avoid children with chickenpox if you have never been exposed to it before. It is caused by the herpes zoster virus which may cause shingles in HIV-positive adults. Water supplies may not be as pure as we like to think they are, and could also be a source of infection (see below). There has also been concern about the possible risk of infections from pets. Some doctors warn that diseases could be acquired from cats, birds or dogs, such as toxoplasmosis. Others would agree that whilst this is true in principle, in practice if you have owned a pet for a while there may be no extra risk to you because of the nature of opportunistic infections. Most of them involve the activation or reactivation of micro-organisms which entered the body in the past. On that basis, if you have already had a particular pet, you are unlikely to be at risk of anything new from them. There is also evidence to suggest that the risk of acquiring such infections from animals is in reality low. One study has reported that people with HIV who owned cats were no more likely to develop toxoplasmosis during their illness than those who did not own cats. The best advice is to discuss the particular issues for you with your doctor. In any case, it cannot do any harm to take standard precautions. Get someone else to clean pet litter; or clean pet litter using rubber gloves, hot water and strong disinfectants. Always wash your hands between touching pets and handling food. The water supply People with HIV may be well advised to treat tap water with some caution. Water companies cannot guarantee that water supplies are free from Cryptosporidium or other micro-organisms which cause diarrhoea in HIV-positive people who have compromised immunity. Once contracted, Cryptosporidium seems impossible to eliminate in HIV-positive people who have CD4 counts below 200 and leads to massive diarrhoea and malabsorption. It is a serious opportunistic infection against which current treatments are only partially successful. Although some people may have been carrying Cryptosporidium for years without symptoms, many people probably only become infected only when their immune system is already damaged. There have been several outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in London and Oxfordshire in recent years which have caused severe diarrhoea even in healthy people. These outbreaks have been traced to the water supply. Contamination of the water-supply in Milwaukee in 1993 resulted in 45% of the HIV-positive people with CD4 counts below 200 living in the city at the time of the contamination developing cryptosporidiosis, and infected people had a significantly increased death-rate. 52% of patients with cryptosporidiosis were either dead or terminally ill at 6 months. Thames Water say that it is impossible to filter drinking water for the Cryptosporidium oocyst (or egg) because the infectious dose is so low. Hundreds of gallons of water would need to be screened to find one oocyst. Unlike bacterial infections, which are able to establish themselves only when tens of thousands of bacteria get into the gut, ten Cryptosporidium oocysts are enough to cause severe diarrhoea. The National Cryptosporidium Research Project, financed by water companies and the Drinking Water Authority, has investigated whether individuals who are most vulnerable to cryptosporidial infection can protect themselves by using domestic water filters. Researchers found that filters with a mesh of less than 5 microns could prevent Cryptosporidium-size particles from passing into the water supply, and it is possible to have such a filter fixed to your domestic water supply. Filtered water should be kept in the fridge. If it is left at room temperature, it may actually be more vulnerable to bacterial contamination than plain tap water because filtering removes the chlorine which is added to water supplies. The main drawback of filtered water is the cost; around ~100 for the filter and fitting. The only other way to eliminate the organism is to boil drinking water for twenty minutes. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this can reduce the risk of contracting cryptosporidiosis. Such a lengthy boiling period is necessary in order to ensure that all the water has reached boiling point; an automatic kettle switches off when the water in contact with the filament has reached boiling point. Some experts on water safety say that this is not long enough to ensure the elimination of some organisms. Many people assume that bottled mineral water is always safe, but this is definitely not true. Bottled water sources cannot be screened for Cryptosporidium either, and other bacteria not present in chlorinated tap water have been found in some brands of bottled water. It is important to remember that drinking water includes the water with which you brush your teeth and prepare or wash food (for people with T-cell counts below 200, this means perpetual vigilance). Drinking water may also contain other diarrhoea-causing bacteria. These have been isolated in bottled water as well as tap water, and the only way to remove these bacteria is either to boil water or to use a very fine mesh filter, even finer than the filters recommended for Cryptosporidium. Jug filters, which are very popular, tend to remove chemical impurities but may not always screen out bacteria. To make life easier, it may help to boil up water once a day and keep it in the fridge to use later on. Don't use boiled water that is over 1 2 hours old, even if it has been kept in the fridge. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to monitor the quality of water which you drink or which is used in the preparation of food outside the home. In these circumstances the best policy may be to avoid salads and other raw foods, and to drink bottled water from deep mountain springs, which are least likely to be contaminated with Cryptosporidium. Other infections may be acquired from water used for drinking and washing. American researchers have reported that up to one-third of water samples from towns in New 62 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES [Page 63](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/69?q1=directories) England were contaminated with Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI) microorganisms. They also found that hot water systems in several hospitals were contaminated with MAI, suggesting that showers and bath water may also be a route of infection. People with CD4 counts below 100, and especially below 50, are vulnerable to MAI. Water outside the UK presents numerous problems to the traveller. Even in other European countries it is best to stick to boiled water, or if this is difficult, bottled water which comes from deep mountain springs. In tropical and sub-tropical countries water presents a very serious health hazard to HIV-positive people. A large number of gut infections are water-borne, including some which cause life-threatening diarrhoea, and any traveller who returns from these countries with diarrhoea will tell you that however tempting it may look, roadside food and drink is not worth the risk. Swimming in the sea or in rivers may also be inadvisable for people with compromised immune systems, especially off the British coast. Several recent reports have highlighted extensive problems with water-borne infections contracted from polluted or sewage-ridden water. This is also known to be a problem in many Mediterranean resorts and a cautious approach would to be restrict bathing to chlorinated swimming pools. Although you may assume that you will be warned by water companies if there is anything seriously wrong with your water supply, this may not happen until too late. In 1991 Thames Water took more than eight hours to alert the public to the fact that untreated water was being pumped to millions of homes in north and west London. Food poisoning This is bad for everyone but can be more severe in people with AIDS. It makes sense for everyone to take extra precautions. Salmonella is a definite risk for people with HIV. Salmonella is as much a problem in Britain than in other parts of the world. Another possible risk is listeria, another infection spread by food, which may cause particular problems for children with HIV. Shigella and campylobacter can also cause problems. Infections with these organisms can be hard to eradicate, and they can fail to respond to treatments which are effective in HIV-negative people. Because of the squalid conditions in which many fowl are reared, salmonella frequently infects chickens. This means that it is especially important to make sure chicken is cooked through, so that no red blood can be seen at all. Take special care with frozen chickens. Meat should be thawed in the fridge, not at room temperature. Wash your hands after handling uncooked poultry and make sure uncooked meat and poultry is not stored uncovered in the fridge near cold meats or dairy products. Ideally, wash eggs before cracking them, and cook them thoroughly until both the yolk and the white set. Do not use cracked eggs. It is also advisable to avoid unpasteurised dairy products, including milk, 'live yoghurt', and some soft cheeses, which may also contain salmonella and listeria. Some people have advocated live yoghurt as a treatment for thrush. Although there is some evidence that this does indeed have benefits, it is important that people with HIV are aware that it may also carry some risk. It may also be sensible to avoid farm animals and their excreta, including manure, since this can harbour infections such as Cryptosporidium. Organically grown vegetables are often grown in raw manure, so it is wise to brush off as much dirt as possible and then clean the vegetables with boiled water. If reheating food, take care to ensure that it is properly cooked all the way through. With microwave ovens, ensure that the food is not undercooked. Wash fruit and vegetables properly, and keep cutting and preparation surfaces clean. Try to avoid ordering reheated food in restaurants. On holiday in warm climates the risk of food poisoning may well extend to salads and fruit. Reheated food may also have been sitting in the heat for too long. Food which you know has been immediately and thoroughly cooked is safest. Do not use food after its sell-by date. International travel Going to a foreign country can be daunting, as even straightforward everyday tasks may suddenly require learning a whole new set of steps. Just the strain of daily life can become stressful. In addition, you are likely to be exposed to new microorganisms for which your immune system will be unprepared. So it is wise to have a check-up at your clinic before you go, and to ask about any further precautions you need to take. If you are currently using any medications, ensure that you take an adequate supply with you as they may be hard or impossible to obtain abroad. Medicines should be clearly labelled, and at some countries' customs and immigration points it will help to have a doctor's letter stating that you do need the treatments. It is sensible to research local medical facilities before travelling to another country, particularly if local medical care is relatively poor. It may also be wise to find out about local attitudes and laws concerning drug use or homosexuality, in case these cause problems. Make sure that you have appropriate travel and medical insurance. Some policies cover the cost of flying home if you need medical attention. Most policies also include a clause saying that 'self-inflicted' injury is not included; this may include drug-related conditions such as abscesses. Some may also exclude certain named conditions such as HIV infection. Read the small print carefully before signing up for the policy. Respiratory tract infections are a common problem among travellers, and may be a particular risk during air travel in which large numbers of people are confined in a small space, breathing recirculated air. Anecdotal reports suggest that this can increase the risk of developing PCP, and some doctors advise people with HIV and CD4 counts below 200 to time their PCP prophylaxis to take place as close to the time of flying as possible. Changes in air pressure in the plane may worsen ear or sinus infections, but nasal sprays or decongestants may help. Travellers' diarrhoea is usually caused by the contamination of food or water with faecal bacteria. It TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 63 [Page 64](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/70?q1=directories) affects about 40% of travellers to developing countries even when they have perfectly intact immune systems, and can be a particular problem for people with HIV. The most common cause of diarrhoea after travelling is giardiasis, which can be treated quite easily in people with HIV. During travel diarrhoea is likely to be caused by the bacterium Escherichia coil; this is not thought to affect people with HIV worse than uninfected people. Deliberate prophylaxis against diarrhoea is far from being standard practice, although there is evidence that antimicrobial drugs such as Septrin, doxycycline or ciprofloxacin may prevent or reduce travellers' diarrhoea. People taking Septrin to prevent PCP will probably find that it also has some protective effects against gastrointestinal infections. However, the best advice is simply to take as much care as possible with food and water. Where you are uncertain about the standards of hygiene and food preparation, it is wise to avoid tap water and ice; raw or partially cooked shellfish, fish, meat and eggs; fresh (i.e. raw and unpeeled) vegetables and fruit; and unpasteurised dairy products. If you are not immune to hepatitis A and have not been vaccinated, ensure that you receive immune globulin before leaving as this can effectively prevent infection. Vaccinations and immunisations An immunisation (often called a vaccination) is designed to protect the recipient against an infectious disease. Different vaccines are produced in different ways, but all work in a similar way. For hundreds of years it has been recognised that people who have recovered from an illness tend not to be vulnerable to it again - in other words, they have become immune to it. This is because after the immune system is exposed to an antigen, some immune cells become 'memory cells'. When the individual next encounters the same antigen, these memory cells mean that the immune system is already primed to deal rapidly with the antigen before it can establish a lasting infection. Vaccines take advantage of this mechanism by priming the immune system using forms of the organism which cannot cause disease, thus stimulating immunity against the 'real' pathogenic (disease-causing) organisms found naturally. There are three main types of vaccine. Live attenuated vaccines contain the whole actual organism that causes disease, but in a weakened form so that it is unable to cause disease. Inactivated vaccines contain dead organisms which cannot therefore cause infection, but which the immune system can still recognise. Sub-unit vaccines contain only a fragment or part of the organism which is unable to cause infection but which is still sufficient to prime the immune system against the whole organism. Some sub-unit vaccines prime the immune system against harmful substances produced by micro-organisms; for example, the tetanus toxoid vaccine is an immunisation against the poison which the tetanus organism produces, rather than against the tetanus organism itself. The most effective form of vaccine is usually the live attenuated vaccine, because it comes closest to the real conditions in which the immune system is exposed to an antigen and develops memory responses against it. There are particular issues to consider concerning vaccinations for people with HIV. Although killed vaccines and sub-unit vaccines are perfectly safe for HIV-positive people because they contain no infectious matter, there is a danger that a damaged immune system may not be able to control even the weakened or low doses of organisms found in live attenuated vaccines. In other words, there is a theoretical risk with live attenuated immunisations that the vaccine might actually cause the illness it is intended to protect against. However, as more evidence has come to light over the years it has become clear that in many cases live vaccines are safe for people with HIV. The current advice on immunisations for HIV-positive people is contained in the memorandum Immunisation against Infectious Disease, produced by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) of the Department of Health. The memorandum on immunisations is currently being revised and updated. No major changes to the advice for people with HIV are expected. The most recent advice produced by the Department of Health was published in April 1994 in HIV & AIDS: Issues in Primary Care, a GP education resource. The standard guidelines for each vaccine should be used to determine whether a person with HIV should be immunised. For example, Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for injecting drug users, people who change sexual partners frequently, people with haemophilia, health care workers and other occupational risk groups. It may be wise for all HIV-positive people to receive hepatitis B immunisation since they are at increased risk of becoming chronic hepatitis B carriers if they become newly infected. Other vaccines are usually only given to people who are travelling to countries where the disease in question is relatively common. Current advice is that the following vaccines are safe for people with HIV to receive if necessary. Of the live vaccines, measles, mumps, rubella and polio are safe. There is no risk with killed vaccines, and people with HIV are advised to receive the following as circumstances require: should not receive the oral live hepatitis A; hepatitis B; influenza; pneumococcal; meningococcal. Several of the live vaccines raise particular issues for people with HIV. Measles can be a very serious illness in people with HIV. There is a slight risk that the live measles vaccine may cause illness in people with HIV. Vaccination is not normally considered necessary in Britain where the disease is now relatively rare, but in areas such as West Africa where measles is endemic, the small risk from the vaccine has been shown to be outweighed by the protection it can provide against catching measles. In Britain most people receive the live polio vaccine (OPV) on a sugar-cube when they are children. After receiving this 64 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES [Page 65](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/71?q1=directories) vaccine it is usual for people to excrete the polio virus itself in their faeces for several weeks after immunisation. This is potentially infectious to people who have not been immunised, especially if they are also HIV-positive. For this reason, it may be sensible for babies to be given the killed polio vaccine (which has to be specially ordered) if a carer is HIV-positive. If this is impossible, gloves should be worn when changing the nappies of recently immunised babies. If people with HIV are travelling to an area where polio is endemic, it is wise to be vaccinated. Those who received the sugar-cube vaccine when children (probably the majority) are advised to have a 'top-up' with the live OPV vaccine. There have not been any reported problems in people with HIV receiving this immunisation. A killed polio vaccine is also available. It is equally effective but has to be given by injection. Since there is a choice of polio vaccine, many doctors consider it prudent to use the killed vaccine in HIV-positive people, especially those who did not receive the OPV vaccine when children and/or those who have developed symptoms. Another live vaccine is yellow fever. The Department of Health recommends that it should not be given to asymptomatic or symptomatic people with HIV because not enough is yet known as to its safety. However, clinicians report that yellow fever vaccine has been given without problems to many asymptomatic people, although it should certainly be avoided by people who are symptomatic or have a low CD4 count. People with HIV who are travelling to countries where yellow fever is endemic may be required to produce a certificate of vaccination. If vaccination is inadvisable for medical reasons such as HIV infection your doctor should be able to provide you with a letter of exemption. Vaccinations for children There are special considerations for children, particularlybut not exclusively - in developing countries. In order to prevent childhood infections it is important for children to receive all their routine childhood immunisations. Generally immunisations are effective in children who do not have any symptoms, but they are less effective if the child is symptomatic or has AIDS. All immunisations should be given at the normal time for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DPT), polio, measles, mumps and rubella. There are a few exceptions. BCG vaccine against tuberculosis is not advised for children known to be HIV-positive, expecially if they have symptoms. Hepatitis B vaccine should be given to babies whose mother is a hepatitis B carrier. Zoster or measles immunoglobulin should be given to an HIV-infected child who is in contact with chicken pox or measles as this will help to prevent the illness or make it less severe. It is important to tell the doctor if an HIV-infected child has been exposed to these illnesses. Haemophilus influenzae type B and pneumococcal vaccine are recommended for children with HIV infection. During a flu epidemic HIV-positive children should be offered vaccination. Sex It is sensible for people already infected with HIV still to have safer sex for two major reasons, quite apart from the obvious need not to infect other people - to avoid reinfection with HIV from other people, and to avoid other sexually transmitted diseases. The evidence that unsafe sex might damage the health of people with HIV is far from conclusive. However, in 1991, Dr John Phair of the US Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study reported that gay men who had developed AIDS within five years of HIV infection were significantly more likely to have been having unprotected anal intercourse and to have picked up sexually transmitted infections after seroconversion. They were also significantly more likely to have had sexually transmitted diseases before HIV infection occurred. In his report on the study group he concluded: \"These findings suggest that sexually transmitted co-factors, pre or post seroconversion, play a role in the progression of HIV-1 infection. Alternatively, greater sexual activity could increase the hazard of exposure to a more virulent HIV-1 strain.\" Different strains of HIV It is now known that many different strains of HIV exist. Some are more aggressive than others in the test-tube, and it has been suggested that transmission of an aggressive strain (known as syncytium-inducing or SI strains) to an individual who is already infected with a less aggressive (non-syncytium-inducing or NSI) strain may trigger the onset of AIDS. This might happen because the aggressive strain could overwhelm the immune system. For instance, a person's immune system may have responded quite successfully to initial HIV infection, so that the dominant strain of HIV in the body is one which is less harmful to the host. Re-infection with another strain could tip this balance: the host's immune system may be unable to contain a new, more aggressive virus strain, which could therefore be able to replicate rapidly. The aggressive new virus could soon overtake the strain already present to become the dominant strain. Another theory is that the new strains might selectively infect certain types of cells or tissues which had been largely unaffected previously, and so lead to faster disease progression. Concern has also been voiced over the possibility that strains of HIV which have developed resistance to treatments such as AZT could also be passed on. In 1992 Dr Alejo Erice of the University of Minnesota reported the case of a young man who was infected with an AZT-resistant strain of HIV, although this was a case of initial HIV infection rather than re-infection. However, this is all theoretical, and other virological studies have cast doubt on the possibility or significance of re-infection with HIV. Researchers at the Pasteur Institute in Paris compared two HIV-infected gay men who had had unprotected anal sex with multiple HIV-infected partners, and individuals who had acquired HIV infection from a single identifiable source. If re-infection had a significant effect, the expected to find a greater variety of HIV strains amongst the gay men with multiple sources of infection than amongst the individuals with a single source of infection. This was not observed. The degree of genetic variation differed little between the two groups, suggesting TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 65 [Page 66](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/72?q1=directories) either that re-infection does not occur, or that one dominant strain becomes established regardless of the number of sources of infection. Researchers at Edinburgh University studied genetic variations in the HIV strains carried by two different groups of haemophiliacs, one of which had been exposed to a single batch of HIV-infected Factor 8, whilst the other had been exposed both to the Factor 8 received by the first group and subsequently to other infected batches. The second group failed to show a greater degree of genetic. variation or aggressiveness of HIV strain. In summary, no-one knows whether re-infection happens or not, and even if it does, whether transmission of an aggressive strain is significant. Cofactors Although there are these doubts about the importance of re-infection with HIV, there are reasons to believe that other virus infections and sexually transmitted diseases may speed up disease progression. Various theories suggest that other infections may help HIV reproduce and infect cells, and that other infections may themselves damage the immune system. In the first place, many infections are likely to trigger HIV replication simply because they stimulate an immune system response. That immune response will include the activation of latent HIV in immune cells, leading to the production of new HIV and the infection of further cells. For instance, after being infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV), people with HIV infection have been shown to suffer increases in HIV replication. But CMV and some other viruses can also assist HIV in the infection of new cells, and speed up HIV replication in cells which are infected with both HIV and CMV. The same goes for other herpes viruses, HTLV-1 (human T-lymphotropic virus which may cause leukaemia), adenoviruses (which cause chest and throat infections), Epstein-Barr virus (which causes glandular fever), Hepatitis B virus and papovaviruses (viruses which may have a role in causing tumours). All these viruses have the potential to provide 'keys' to cells which HIV would otherwise be unable to infect. Almost all of these viruses are transmitted through sexual or body fluid contact. Some of these viruses may also affect the immune system regardless of HIV infection. A number of studies have observed that in gay men who do not have HIV, those infected with CMV have T-cell abnormalities just like those seen in HIV-positive gay men who later develop AIDS. However, these changes in laboratory tests do not necessarily indicate damage to the functioning of the immune system, and these individuals do not go on to develop opportunistic infections. It is uncertain whether infections other than HIV actually do increase the chances of developing AIDS. It is difficult to separate out the effects of HIV and other infections because so many people are infected with more than one virus (known as 'co-infection'). Although one study, conducted by Dr Christine Lee and Professor Paul Griffiths at the Royal Free Hospital in London in 1989, did show that HIV-positive haemophiliacs who were also infected with CMV were more likely to develop AIDS than HIV-positive haemophiliacs who did not have CMV, more recent follow-up from that study, as well as data from similar 66 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES studies, have found no evidence that CMV does act as a co-factor. Many leading researchers have at one time or another suggested that HIV infection may not be sufficient to cause AIDS on its own, and that additional infections such as herpes viruses or mycoplasmas might be essential co-factors in causing AIDS to develop. But to date, research and epidemiological studies have failed to demonstrate conclusively that these links exist. For instance, several studies have looked for mycoplasma infections in AIDS patients and failed to find them in even a majority of the patients, let alone the whole study group. Exposure to semen Another potential problem with unprotected sex is exposure to semen. One school of thought takes the view that exposure to semen, especially through anal intercourse, in itself plays an important role in the immune suppression that leads to AIDS. Some unorthodox scientists even believe that components of semen, rather than HIV itself, trigger the immune collapse that leads to AIDS, although reproductive immunologists maintain that there is no evidence that sperm has a general immunosuppressive effect, although it does suppress immune defences in the vagina. Others have suggested that sperm causes repeated activation of the immune system in the same way as viruses and other infections. The possibility that sperm can activate cells in the rectum already infected with HIV, thus encouraging replication, cannot be ruled out. STDs and safer sex Some people with HIV prefer to observe stricter safer sex rules than those that are normally recommended by AIDS organisations. This is because there are important differences between safer sex which is designed to minimise the risks of HIV transmission, and safer sex which is intended to reduce the risk of getting other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). For instance, infections such as gonorrhoea can be passed on through oral sex, even if ejaculation does not occur. Herpes infections can be caught through contact with active sores even if no penetrative sex takes place. For people with HIV or AIDS, STDs can be more difficult for the body's defences to deal with. A simple course of antibiotics may not be enough to shift them, and they may appear in a much more aggressive form than we are used to if the immune system is already weakened. For instance, genital warts, which are largely harmless in people without HIV, can become severe and painful in people whose immune systems are damaged. Warts also increase the risk of cervical cancer for women. It is important for HIV-positive women to get regular tests to detect possible cervical dysplasia and have treatment to prevent cervical cancer. People with HIV who catch certain infections even when their immune system is still strong may store up trouble for the future. For instance, infections like herpes or HPV (wart) viruses linger in the body and can flare up if the T-cell count falls. HPV infection increases the risk of cervical or anal abnormalities, which in turn can lead to cancer. Herpes infections are passed on by direct contact with herpes sores on the lips, mouth or genitals. Herpes simplex viruses can be passed on before herpes sores become visible, and a herpes infection can be passed from one part [Page 67](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/73?q1=directories) of the body to another. For instance, you could spread a herpes infection from your mouth to your genitals during an attack. Other viruses are easier to transmit than HIV, and may increase HIV reproduction. All are contained in blood, semen and vaginal fluid, and Epstein-Barr Virus and cytomegalovirus (CMV) can also be transmitted in saliva and urine. You can be vaccinated against Hepatitis B. If you have already been vaccinated, you should be tested every few years to ensure that you still have immunity, because the vaccine does not confer lifetime immunity, and the protective anti-hepatitis B antibodies may decline faster in HIV positive people. Oral-anal contact, or rimming, may be the way that some HIV-positive people become infected with Shigella, gastroenteritis and Cryptosporidium, all of which can be especially severe in immunocompromised people. Even if you believe your partner is 'clean' and that you haven't come into contact with faeces, there may still be a risk of infection. Microscopic Cryptosporidium protozoa may still be present in the anus, for instance. These infections - and others already mentioned - can also be spread from one person to another on fingers which have been inserted into the rectum. It is up to each individual to decide what sex practices they want to keep up, which they want to modify, and which they want to stop. For instance, one might still make the choice not to use condoms for penetrative sex with a regular HIV-positive partner. At the other end of the spectrum, one might decide to begin to use condoms for oral sex. The bottom line is that whether or not re-infection with HIV occurs, other sexually transmitted infections may weaken the immune system. Drug use Sharing needles to inject drugs runs the risk of re-exposure to HIV (although see the discussion above) as well as the added danger of introducing other infections into your body or causing septicaemia. Injecting drug users may be encouraged to stop injecting and to switch over to methadone, or to stop using drugs altogether. These forms of stress may be very difficult to deal with, particularly if they come immediately after a diagnosis of HIV. You have to weigh up which you feel is more of a risk to your health at that moment. There is no clear evidence that using recreational drugs causes significant or lasting damage to the immune system. Although there have been studies that suggest that HIV-positive drug users who continue to inject heroin may develop AIDS faster than those who use other drugs or give up drugs (Ronald), a review of the literature concluded that \"there appears to be little convincing evidence that active drug injection is detrimental to the outcome of HIV infection\" (Phillips). However, the studies are hard to interpret and several studies have found that rates of progression to AIDS in injecting drug user cohorts are faster than those in cohorts of other exposure groups. See also Smoking and Poppers below. Phillips AN et al. Active drug injecting and progression of HIV infection. AIDS 8(3):385-386, 1994. Ronald PJM et al. Continued drug use and other cofactors for progression to AIDS among injecting drug users. AIDS 8:339-343, 1994. Smoking The evidence of the effects of smoking on disease progression is contradictory. One study showed that smokers have an increased risk of progression, but paradoxically, another study has also shown that smokers were less likely to progress to symptoms. A study at St Mary's Hospital in London since 1986 has shown that HIV-positive smokers developed PCP about twice as fast as a comparable group of non-smokers. Ex-smokers who had given up at least a year before they entered the study seemd to be at no greater risk than non-smokers. Unfortunately the study excluded people who smoked less than 10 cigarettes a day or who had given up during the course of the study. The researchers suggest that smoking may directly affect the immune cells in the lungs, activating HIV-infected cells and reducing the ability of immune cells in the lungs and airways to combat infection. Smokers were not at increased risk from other infections such as KS. In 1992 doctors in Seattle conducted a much larger review of 598 HIV-positive people. They too noted that smokers among this group were three times more likely to have developed PCP than non-smokers, with the heaviest smokers at highest risk. In the general population, smoking is a risk factor for candida in the mouth. However, a study presented at the 10th International Conference on AIDS found that although smoking increased the number of Candida organisms detectable in swabs from the mouth, it did not seem to increase the risk of developing symptoms of candidiasis. Buskin SE et al. Heavy smoking increases the risk of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). 8th Intl Conf AIDS, Amsterdam, abstract WeC 1030, 1992. Nieman RB et al.

Nittayananta W Effects of smoking on the prevalence of oral candidiasis in HIV-infected persons. 10th Intl Conf AIDS, Yokohama, abstract PB0589, 1994. Poppers Some people have argued that poppers (inhaled nitrites) poppers suppress the immune system. Several studies have now been conducted to look at the effects of nitrites on the immune systems of mice and humans. The first study of nitrites was reported in 1983, and dismissed their effects as insignificant. Critics of this study say this result was hardly surprising given the doses used, doses which one would expect to encounter if one left an open bottle of poppers in a room, rather than inhaling them directly from the bottle. Even though the mice were receiving comparatively low doses, they developed a yellowish skin tone and their white blood cell counts went down. TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 67 [Page 68](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/74?q1=directories) Later studies used larger doses and found correspondingly greater impairment of immune function. Researchers at the University of Arkansas found that mice exposed to nitrites for 45 minutes daily for 14 days suffered serious impairment of their T-cell functions and the ability of their macrophages to control the development of potential tumours. Critics of this study point out that the mice were exposed to huge amounts of nitrites. The only study to have taken place in humans gave normal doses of nitrites to HIV-negative men three times a day for one week and then intermittently for a further one and a half weeks. By the end of this period the main defect in immune function was in the level of natural killer (NK) cells, which recognise and destroy a wide range of infected body cells or tumour cells. Levels of T-lymphocytes were not seriously affected and there was no selective effect on any sub-groups of T-lymphocytes. However researchers concluded that their evidence suggested that \"chronic exposure to inhaled nitrites, even at relatively infrequent intervals, is sufficient to produce longer lasting alteration in lymphocyte function... In humans, inhalation of volatile nitrites causes cycles of modest immunosuppression, particularly in natural killer cell activity, followed by a gradual recovery when the drug is not inhaled for several days... Nitrite-induced suppression of natural killer cell activity may play a role in [KS] pathogenesis.\" While these studies can provide suggestive evidence, it is important to remember that they are far from conclusive. We do not know whether such changes in immune cell levels actually have any harmful effects. No studies have yet demonstrated that alterations in NK cell levels correlate with any of the illnesses experienced by people with HIV, or that users of poppers experience different patterns of illness, with the possible exception of KS. Even if poppers do cause immune suppression, this would not necessarily automatically result in KS. In the absence of conclusive evidence, most independent experts feel that it is too early to make hard-and-fast recommendations on poppers use. Factor VIII Several studies have shown that the purity of the Factor VIII treatment used by HIV-positive people with haemophilia can influence the speed of progression. People receiving intermediate quality Factor VIII tend to experience faster disease progression that comparable people receiving high purity Factor VIII. This is thought to be because the lower purity product contains more foreign blood proteins that may activate the immune system, stimulating HIV-infected cells to replicate. SEREMETIS SV et al. Three year randomised study of high purity and intermediate purity factor VIII concentrate in symptom free HIV-seropositive haemophiliacs: effectd on immune status. Lancet 342:700-703, 1993 Nutrition and vitamins A balanced diet Most nutritional principles for people with HIV are identical to those recommended to everyone else, and a well-balanced diet should contain sufficient nutrients to meet the recommendations given for the population at large. Typically, it should contain enough protein in the form of meat, cheese, fish, eggs, milk, or a mixture of foods which together will supply good quality protein, for example rice/pasta/bread/potatoes in combination with peas/beans/legumes. A well balanced diet should also contain sufficient vitamins and minerals from sources such as fruit, salads and vegetables. It is easier to achieve a balanced diet if you eat a wide variety of foods. It is therefore better to eat two or three times a day or more, rather than only once. The specific nutrient requirements for asymptomatic people with HIV infection are not known to be different from anybody else. However, people who, quite apart from their 68 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES HIV infection, have a very poor nutritional starting point could be pre-disposed to infections and other illnesses. Interactions between drugs and food There are a number of interactions between diet and drug treatments which are important. For example, some drugs such as ketoconazole need to be taken at the same time as food, to improve their absorption, and others, like rifampicin, have to be taken before food. Some treatment drugs may also cause gastrointestinal upsets; some antibiotics or the anti-HIV drug ddl, for example, may cause diarrhoea. Your doctor and dietitian will be able to advise whether varying the pattern of medication, or whether or not it is taken with food, can reduce such problems. See the section on taking drugs in Getting treatment for more details. [Page 69](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/75?q1=directories) Alternative diets Many different diets and dietary products are offered to people with HIV and AIDS. Doctors and dietitians are generally very antagonistic towards alternative diets, because in some instances people with HIV genuinely are misled. It is therefore worth asking some questions about any recommendations you may receive: * Check out the qualifications of the therapist who is recommending the diet or product; * Ask abput the cost of the diet or product before deciding to use it. It may be helpful to get the cost in writing; * Ask if the diet has been proven to help people with HIV, or indeed whether it has been shown to be detrimental to health. Ask where the research was done and whether the results have been published; * Get further opinions on diets and products from any or all of the following: your doctor, your dietitian, members of self-help groups, AIDS service organisations or helplines. You may be reassured that a particular diet or supplement is alright, or you may be advised to try something else instead. However, it is important to remember that HIV is a relatively new disease, and research into nutritional factors is quite young, and hence few of the diets recommended by even registered dietitians would stand up to this degree of special questioning. On the other hand, it is likely that they have been tested against general scientific knowledge of nutritional principles. Dietitians report that one of the most popular diets used by people with HIV infection is the macrobiotic diet. Diets such as this may confer no harm to you as such, but because they are particularly high in fibre (and therefore bulky) and low in calories (energy) you will need to eat a lot more food a day to maintain your energy and protein requirements. In practice, this may not be possible if you have a depressed appetite or other problems which reduce your food intake. However, if an individual has firmly decided to follow a particular dietary regime, it is still important to consult a dietitian who will usually be able to work with that regime and find ways to secure balanced overall nutrition. As a general rule, it is worth consulting your dietitian before taking the initiative on your own. For example, it may not be wise simply to adopt dietary changes commonly recommended in health education campaigns, because these are generally intended to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and are low in calories (which may lead to undesirable weight loss) and low in cholesterol (which some researchers believe affects lymphocyte function). For more detailed information about specific diets see the section on Dietary therapies in the A - Z of Complementary and alternative therapies. Vitamins and minerals There are many claims that vitamins and minerals can enhance or impair immune responses. The following is a summary of current opinion and studies looking at the use of particular vitamins and minerals in HIV-positive people. It is important to note that most vitamins and minerals play an anti-oxidant role and as such work in combination by contributing to many different bodily processes. Anti-oxidants prevent damage to tissues and cells by electrons called free radicals, which are generated as a by-product of inflammation, infection and a host of other bodily processes. Deficiencies or over-abundance of one particular vitamin may have serious effects on the usefulness of others. It is important to bear in mind that whilst research reports deficiencies of many micronutrients in HIV-positive people, especially in people diagnosed with AIDS, the significance of these deficiencies is unclear. They may be due to: * temporary fluctuations as a response to viral infection * malabsorption of micronutrients due to gut infections * oxidative stress On the other hand, levels may appear normal in some people as a consequence of the breakdown of tissues during wasting syndrome. Vitamins and minerals previously stored in the tissues may flood into the circulation. The extent to which immunity can be boosted by supplementing micronutrients is a matter of controversy, as indeed is almost any form of 'nutritional medicine'. In the sub-section below on micronutrients we have summarised what is known about the relationship between micronutrients and immunity and where the areas of doubt exist. Until clinical trials currently in the planning stage have been completed, it is unlikely that a clear answer will be available to the question of whether micronutrient deficiencies and supplementation affect the development of immune deficiency in HIV-positive people. In the absence of clear-cut evidence from clinical trials, many HIV-positive people have decided to use vitamin and mineral supplements in order to take advantage of any immune enhancing potential they may have. If you decide to use vitamins and minerals as an adjunct to other treatments, there are several issues worth considering: * An absence of some nutrients may negate the usefulness of others. A good baseline is to take a multivitamin and mineral supplement. A multivitamin supplement is available on prescription. Ask your doctor or dietitian about this. * Take care not to exceed the toxic dose. If you are taking large doses of some vitamins in addition to a daily multivitamin, check that the combined total doesn't approach a level at which toxicities could occur. * Look carefully at the form of the vitamins you choose. Some forms of vitamins are much more easily absorbed by the body than others. See Quality and availability below. * Shop around. Vitamins and minerals purchased through reputable buyers clubs are often cheaper than those purchased through health food shops and nutritional advisers. TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 69 [Page 70](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/76?q1=directories) * Be sceptical about claims regarding the superiority of some products. It is very hard to be sure whether new formulas really are better than others on the market, or whether they are innovations designed to give companies a competitive edge. Like the pharmaceutical market, the vitamin market is highly competitive and also big business, so many claims made may have a financial incentive. Just because one study has shown that an ingredient appears to improve absorption, is this a convincing reason for spending an extra ~5 a week on that product? Quality and availability of vitamins Most doctors will say that the best place from which to get vitamins and minerals is food. But if you have deficiencies, this suggests that your diet is not currently providing the micronutrients you need. Learning more about nutrition will help you identify foods which may be high in micronutrients, but supplementation may give you a better chance of absorbing what you need. In anyone with gut or digestive problems, the breakdown of food is required before vitamins and minerals can be absorbed. This may not always occur. An NHS dietitian can assess your food intake and tell you if you are seriously deficient, but the primary objective of most NHS dietary advice is to avoid weight loss and to maintain energy levels. Supplementation may increase the chance that vitamins will be absorbed, depending on the condition of the gut. Opinions differ on the levels of micronutrient supplementation which are appropriate for people with HIV. The HIV Nutrition Team, in guidelines presented at its annual conference in October 1993, recommended that those with low dietary intakes should be prescribed supplements. Only one complete multivitamin supplement, Forceval, is licensed for prescription through the NHS. Doctors cannot prescribe other over-the-counter supplements which may contain much higher levels of some vitamins such as vitamin C unless they have agreement from the pharmacist of their district health authority to reimburse the cost of these drugs. Inevitably, virtually all pharmacists are unwilling to allocate funds to vitamin supplements without evidence from clinical trials. People with HIV are faced with a bewildering array of vitamin and mineral supplements if they choose to supplement. If you believe that vitamin supplements are useful, you should look for varieties which are more bio-available: those which contain a liquid form of the vitamin, or capsules which contain a powdered form of the vitamin. Compressed tablets take longer to dissolve, especially in people with digestive problems, and the usefulness of time release tablets depends upon the vagaries of your digestive system. Fat soluble vitamins such as vitamin A and E are only absorbed when food reaches the end of the small intestine and time release tablets work by releasing small amounts of mixed nutrients all the way down the digestive tract, not by releasing nutrients at the optimal absorption 70 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES site. If the tablet is not dissolved properly, it may already have passed the point in your gut at which some nutrients are best absorbed, in which case these will be excreted rather than taken up further down the gut, or the tablet may release vitamins before the site at which they can be absorbed. After dissolving into a bioavailable form in the stomach, the nutrient must then be absorbed through the wall of the gut. Some are more easily absorbed than others. Minerals are more easily absorbed when in a chelated form (i.e. attached to amino-acids which can aid the absorption of the mineral). There seems to be little difference between synthetic and natural forms of vitamins in their biovailability, except in the case of vitamin E, the natural form of which is much more easily taken up by the body. Similarly, natural beta-carotene supplies a wider range of carotenoids than synthetic forms and this may make it a more effective anti-oxidant. Supplements should be taken with food in order to enhance their absorption and bioavailability. For people who wish to reduce their yeast intake to avoid stimulating the development of candida, it may be necessary to avoid vitamin tablets which contain yeast in the formula: a surprising number do. Vegetarians are likely to wish to avoid gelatin capsules: gelatin is boiled-down animal hide and bones. Some supplements contain unspecified amounts of sugar and food colourings and some may also contain lactose. Buying vitamins Since many vitamin supplements are not routinely available on NHS prescription, it is worth shopping around to find the best price. A number of organisations are beginning to establish buyers clubs in order to obtain supplements at wholesale prices. Such buyer's clubs are a longstanding feature of US AIDS treatment. Nutritional advisers who advise on the use of supplements often receive commission from manufacturers or make a profit from selling supplements in addition to charging for consultations. As a general principle, healthy balanced diets cost no more than unhealthy unbalanced ones. It is possible to eat a highly expensive balanced healthful diet, but it is also possible to live very cheaply on a tight budget. If specific diets are needed because of particular eating problems or dietary requirements, these may be more expensive e.g. providing lactose-free milk substitutes. Most essential nutritional services can be obtained through the Health Service. If you need financial assistance with your diet for whatever reason, the first step is to contact your dietitian. He or she will be able to put you in contact with a variety of other health workers such as social workers and welfare rights officers. In turn, they may contact local voluntary agencies who can offer extra assistance. [Page 71](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/77?q1=directories) References ADA Report.

When to start treatment Conflicting advice In Britain at present there are no standard guidelines on when people with HIV should start treatment, or with what drug(s). The only licensed anti-HIV drugs in Britain are AZT and ddl. Their licenses give some indication of when the medicines licensing authorities consider that the use of the drug may be appropriate. AZT is approved in Britain for treating any person with HIV who has developed symptoms. It is also licensed for the treatment of symptom-free people whose CD4 count is below 200, or between 200 and 500 and falling rapidly. However, this indication does not mean that standard good practice is to prescribe AZT to anyone who meets these criteria. The vast majority of AIDS doctors have no doubt that AZT is valuable for people with symptomatic disease, and especially for people with HIV-related brain problems - although it is hard to know how great that benefit is, or how long it lasts. However, the use of AZT by people who have no symptoms is much more controversial, and doctors disagree on this in good faith. The results of the Anglo-French Concorde trial suggest that AZT taken before symptoms develop provides at best a limited and short-lived delay in minor symptoms and does not delay the onset of AIDS. It found no difference in survival between asymptomatic people who took AZT as soon as they joined the trial and those who only took AZT if they developed signs of disease progression. ddl is licensed for people who are intolerant of AZT or who are experiencing disease progression despite taking AZT. ddC is licensed in the USA for use in combination with AZT, and is available for combination use in the UK through a compassionate release scheme operated by its manufacturer, Roche. Guidelines for using AZT, ddl and ddC were drawn up in the USA in summer 1993. Many leading British doctors agree with these recommendations, and they are the closest we have to an overview of current good practice in using anti-retroviral drugs. TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 71 [Page 72](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/78?q1=directories) The theory of early intervention The idea of early intervention is to provide prompt medical treatment relatively early in the course of HIV infection, before clinical symptoms have developed, with the aim of preventing or delaying the appearance of those symptoms. In other words, it is a form of preventive treatment (or prophylaxis) against developing symptomatic HIV disease or AIDS. It is important to be aware that most early intervention therapies for people with asymptomatic HIV infection are still experimental. There are three possible approaches to early intervention: * Using anti-HIV drugs such as AZT * Using immune stimulants or therapeutic vaccines * Using prophylaxes against opportunistic conditions In addition, it is worth noting that many people regard maximising their general state of health as an excellent early intervention in its own right, even though it doesn't exactly fit the strict definition of early intervention. This may range from giving up smoking or other drugs, taking exercise, improving diet, to stress-reduction, relaxation and other alternative or complementary therapies. But no scientific studies have yet proved that in themselves these things make a difference. Early use of anti-HIV drugs AIDS researchers are increasingly convinced that the most effective treatment for people with HIV will require the use of anti-HIV therapy as early as possible after infection. There are several factors which suggest that early treatment is a logical strategy. First, studies have shown that there is no truly latent stage of HIV infection. Even though the majority of people with HIV feel perfectly healthy and have no symptoms, HIV is actively reproducing itself in the body from soon after infection. It has been shown that major sites of viral replication at this stage are in the lymph glands and thymus; previous studies may therefore have underestimated the amount of viral reproduction during the asymptomatic phase because they only measured HIV's activity in the bloodstream. Secondly, the virulence of HIV and its susceptibility to antiviral drugs also varies during the course of the disease. Early in infection, strains of HIV called NSI strains are predominant within the body. These seem to be less harmful to human cells than the more aggressive, SI strains which become more common later in the course of disease. Research suggests that the switch from NSI to SI strains within the body usually occurs before HIV-related symptoms have developed. The less virulent NSI strains appear to be more vulnerable to AZT than the SI strains found in more advanced HIV disease, but AZT seems to be unable to prevent the development of SI strains. Thirdly, it makes sense to try to preserve immune functioning while it is still intact, rather than waiting until it has already been significantly damaged. An effective early treatment might arrest or at least slow down the loss of CD4 cells, keeping them at a level at which most opportunistic infections do not occur. Fourthly, tests have shown that HIV strains which are resistant to AZT develop more slowly in people with HIV who take AZT at an early stage of disease compared with those treated later. AZT also causes fewer side effects when taken by symptom-free people. However, these potential advantages obviously need to be considered alongside information on the actual benefits of AZT in early HIV infection; simply because a drug is safe is not reason enough to take it. That is the logic behind early treatment. Unfortunately, we may not yet have the effective anti-HIV drug or drugs which could translate the theory into practice. Studies have confirmed that in the short term AZT may slow down disease progression, improve the CD4 count and prevent minor HIV-related symptoms. However, the results of the Concorde study suggest that taking AZT early does not prevent the development of AIDS, and in the longer term there is no difference in survival between people who take early AZT and those who only take the drug if they experience disease progression. This has led some researchers to the conclusion that AZT monotherapy is simply not an effective enough anti-HIV drug to be a successful form of early intervention. That is why the American guidelines described below recommend that people do not start to take AZT until, at the earliest, their CD4 count has fallen below 500. They also recognise that it is perfectly reasonable to wait until symptoms develop, or the CD4 count is below 200, before considering AZT. Very early trials have suggested that combination therapy with AZT plus ddl or AZT plus ddC may be more effective than AZT alone as initial treatment. Studies like the Delta trial are assessing the benefits of using combination therapy as the initial form of anti-HIV treatment, rather than AZT monotherapy. In the future, it is possible that early intervention with antiviral drugs will use combinations of two, three or more drugs from the moment that somebody tests HIV-positive. Other debates about early use of anti-retrovirals have centred upon two concerns. First, early treatment may result in the early development of drug-resistant strains of HIV. HIV has been shown to mutate into a form which is less susceptible to the effects of anti-HIV drugs after a period of treatment with those drugs. This has been shown for all the anti-HIV drugs which have been tested in humans to date. The development of viral resistance has been shown to correlate with an increased likelihood of disease progression, although other factors may be more important. Resistance to AZT develops more slowly, and tends to be less marked, in people who take AZT when they are still asymptomatic as opposed to later in disease. However, the threat of resistance means that some people prefer not to take AZT until after they have developed symptoms, when they feel they will most need it. Others prefer to take AZT early, and hope that other, 72 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES [Page 73](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/79?q1=directories) possible more effective drugs will be available should they develop symptoms in the future. Secondly, it is possible that the drugs may cause side-effects which outweigh any advantage. People who use anti-retroviral drugs early in disease may end up taking them for longer periods than has previously been the case. No-one really knows what long-term side-effects these drugs may have, which may not have been noted in the shorter studies focusing on people who are already ill. In the American ACTG 019 trial of AZT for asymptomatic people, the increase in quality of life that participants experienced due to delaying disease progression was achieved only at the cost of an equivalent decrease in quality of life due to severe side-effects from AZT, and any benefits from early treatment might actually be outweighed if mild-to-moderate side-effects and other quality of life issues were taken into account. It has been suggested that the increased incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) may be a long term side effect of AZT in symptomatic people who have been taking AZT for about 3 years. However, it is more likely that lymphomas are occurring because the people taking AZT are surviving for longer with severely damaged immune systems. These potential problems might be overcome by using combinations of drugs in lower doses, perhaps resulting in fewer toxicities and less viral resistance. Alternatively, increasingly safer drugs may be developed which are just as efficient. Other forms of 'early intervention' Early intervention does not simply mean early AZT. Many people regard maximising their general state of health as an excellent early intervention. This may range from giving up smoking or other drugs, taking exercise and improving diet, to stress reduction, relaxation and other alternative or complementary therapies. Some people with HIV also choose to take immune boosting treatments before any symptoms develop. Preventive treatments against opportunistic infections such as PCP can be used to avoid a first attack, as well as after a first infection to try to prevent a recurrence. The most effective form of PCP prophylaxis is Septrin (co-trimoxazole). As this is taken in tablet form, it can prevent not only PCP in the lungs, but also the rarer forms of PCP that can occur elsewhere in the body. Septrin also appears to provide a real level of prophylactic protection against toxoplasmosis. However, quite a large proportion of people experience side-effects from Septrin. Alternative forms of PCP prophylaxis include aerosolised pentamidine, which is less effective and only works in the lungs, but rarely causes side effects. Surrogate markers for early intervention By definition, people who may benefit from early intervention have no symptoms of HIV disease. Within this group of people with asymptomatic HIV infection, there are large variations in the risk of developing more serious disease. Early intervention is most likely to be most helpful for people with a higher risk of disease progression. These people can be distinguished by having certain abnormalities in laboratory tests. These tests are sometimes called surrogate markers because they act as a substitute for the signs and symptoms of disease that would normally guide clinical intervention. So far, the most widely used surrogate marker is the CD4 T-cell count. The current recommendations are that people with CD4 counts less than 200 should receive some form of prevention against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). AZT is licensed, although not necessarily recommended, for use in people with fewer than 500 CD4 T-cells. T-cell counts are different in children and vary with age - it has been suggested that PCP prophylaxis should begin when the count falls below 1500 for children aged 1-11 months; below 750 for aged 12-23 months; below 500 for 2-6 year-olds; and below 200 for children aged over 6 years. It is unclear when AZT treatment should be offered to children; many paediatricians offer AZT when symptomatic disease occurs. It is likely that as we learn more, other surrogate markers will become more important. The probable end result is that a combination of several markers will be used in this assessment. US guidelines for using AZT, ddl and ddC A panel convened by the US National Institutes for Health issued state-of-the-art guidelines for using AZT, ddl and ddC in summer 1993. The last such panel met in 1990, soon after the results of the trial ACTG 019 had suggested that 'early intervention' with AZT had a significant effect on disease progression. That panel recommended that all HIV-infected people with CD4 counts below 500 should start taking AZT. The new panel reviewed the results from several trials since then, and issued updated recommendations. One of the studies which most influenced the panel was the Concorde study of AZT. The panel also considered data from several American trials which assessed the usefulness of switching from AZT to ddl or ddC, and ACTG 155, the first trial of combination therapy with AZT plus ddC. The panel was asked to translate the results of these studies into answers to the practical questions faced by people with HIV and their doctors. When should people with HIV start antiviral treatment? There is no conclusive evidence that people with CD4 counts above 500 benefit from antiviral treatment. The panel therefore suggested that these people should simply receive medical monitoring, rather than starting treatment. TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 73 [Page 74](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/80?q1=directories) For people without symptoms whose CD4 count is below 500, the panel suggests two options: * continue monitoring and do not start therapy until disease progression occurs * start treatment. What should the initial treatment drug be? Several trials have compared AZT with ddl or ddC for people who are just beginning antiviral therapy. These trials showed that AZT is the most effective initial treatment drug. Preliminary data from trials of the combinations of AZT plus ddl and AZT plus ddC suggest that people taking these regimes experience higher and more long-lasting increases in their CD4 counts compared to single-drug monotherapy. However, it has not yet been shown whether these changes in laboratory tests actually result in slower disease progression or improved survival. The panel's recommendation was therefore that people should start treatment with AZT alone. They noted that \"combination therapy with AZT and ddl or AZT and ddC also may be considered, although clinical trials have not conclusively demonstrated clinical benefit to date\". Should people change their treatment at some point even though they are tolerating AZT without serious side-effects? This question reflects the findings of two American trials, ACTG 116A and ACTG 116B/11 7. These studies concluded that people who had been taking AZT for some time experienced slower disease progression - but no improvement in survival - if they switched to ddl, even though they were stable on AZT. However, the panel was critical of the way in which these trials had been analyzed; the benefits of switching from AZT to ddl were seen only in certain sub-groups of the trial participants, and the trials were not originally designed to be able to detect those sub-group differences. The panel's recommendations depend on the individual's CD4 count. People are not recommended to switch if their CD4 count is above 300 and they seem to be stable on AZT. However, two options are proposed for people with CD4 counts below 300: continue AZT, or change to ddl. In the ACTG trials, people who had taken AZT for at least four months, and on average had taken thirteen months of AZT, seemed to benefit most from switching from AZT to ddl. What are the treatment options for people who cannot take AZT because of side-effects, or whose condition deteriorates while they are taking AZT? A number of studies have investigated the treatment options for people who have been taking AZT for some time but have to stop because of side-effects (known as AZT intolerance) or because they are experiencing disease progression despite taking AZT (known as AZT failure). People who are intolerant of AZT are not recommended to try combination therapy, because those combinations usually include AZT. If an individual started AZT very early and has developed intolerance when their CD4 count is still above 500, the panel recommends that they stop AZT and do not start alternative antiviral treatment unless their CD4 count falls or they develop symptoms. For AZT-intolerant people with CD4 counts between 50 and 500, the recommended treatment is ddl. At CD4 counts below 50, switching to either ddl or ddC is suggested. The CPCRA 002 community-based study suggested that AZT-intolerant people might have slightly better survival if they took ddC rather than ddl. However, the benefits of ddl and ddC for AZT-intolerant people have still not been clearly established. The panel therefore recognised that stopping antiviral treatment altogether is another valid option. People who are taking AZT without serious side-effects, but whose condition seems to be worsening, are advised to switch to a different antiviral regime. Two options are suggested: stop AZT and switch to a different single drug, such as ddl, or continue to take AZT but add either ddl or ddC as a second drug (i.e. start combination therapy). But combination therapy is not recommended for people with CD4 counts below 50, because of the results of ACTG 155. This trial suggested that the combination of AZT plus ddC was no better than either AZT or ddC alone for people with low CD4 counts - and there was a possibility that the combination was actually less effective than the single-drug options.

AIDS researchers are currently working on developing two types of vaccines: preventative vaccines, to prevent uninfected people from becoming infected with HIV, and therapeutic vaccines, to stimulate the immune response against HIV in people who are already infected. This section describes the'rationale for vaccine research and current progress towards a preventative vaccine. The immune response to HIV To understand current approaches to developing vaccines against HIV, it is necessary to understand some of the characteristics of the immune system's response to HIV. HIV is unlike most other pathogens in that it infects or affects key cells in the immune system, which otherwise would be involved in the fight against the virus, and it is able to evade the normal immune response. The immune system can respond to foreign organisms in two main ways. The humoral immune response is that part of the immune system which relies on antibodies. However, it has been known for some time that antibody responses to foreign antigens can either neutralise or enhance the infection. In the case of HIV infection, neutralising antibodies recognise and lock onto gpl 20, the viral protein on the surface of HIV particles and HIV-infected cells. By locking onto gpl 20, these antibodies may prevent the virus from binding onto human cells; they may also 'mark' the viral particles and infected cells for destruction by other elements of the immune system. The parts of gpl 20 targeted by neutralising antibodies are called neutralisation sites. The most important neutralisation site is called the V3 loop (variable region number 3). It is made up of 38 amino acids, the majority of which vary from one HIV particle to another. However, three amino acids are always present, two at the foot of the loop and a central sequence formed by one protein with a glycine molecule on either side, called Gly-pro-Gly. In vitro studies have shown that antibodies against the V3 loop are able to prevent the virus from infecting a cell for up to 30 minutes after it has attached itself to that cell's CD4 molecule. Results in chimpanzees also show that antibodies which attach to the V3 loop can protect the animals from infection if they are injected with HIV. However, other antibodies called enhancing antibodies can actually increase the ability of HIV to infect cells. These antibodies lock onto the virus, forming complexes of virus and antibody. However, the antibodies also have a fragment called Fc, which itself fits into receptors on certain immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages. When a macrophage locks onto an HIV/antibody complex, the virus is able to infect the macrophage more easily. This effect has been seen in in vitro studies, but not yet described in vivo. This may be due to a balancing effect of neutralising antibodies. An effective vaccine against HIV would therefore aim to stimulate neutralising antibodies, but to avoid producing enhancing antibodies. The cellular immune response is that part of the immune response which relies on CD8 cells (cytotoxic T cells). The presence of cytotoxic T cells which are able to recognise HIV antigens on the surface of infected cells and destroy those cells has been observed in people with HIV. In the case of most viruses other then HIV, these CD8 cells are the most effective means of eliminating infected cells. However, in people with HIV, CD8 cells seem to disappear as the illness progresses from symptom-free infection to AIDS. And in other diseases, CD8 cell responses can directly contribute to the damage caused by a disease. For example, CD8 cells responding to hepatitis B infection also kill uninfected, healthy human cells in the liver, in HIV disease, CD8 cells are believed to be the cause of inflammation in the lungs, central nervous system and lymph nodes, and also contribute to the destruction of uninfected cells which have the HIV protein gp120 attached to their surfaces. When the immune system is activated to respond to an antigen, some of the immune cells become 'memory' cells. Then, the next time an individual comes into contact with that same antigen, the existence of memory cells means that the immune system is primed to destroy it quickly, before it can establish a new infection in the body. This is why people who have recovered from an illness tend not to be susceptible to the same illness again. Vaccines contain either non-infectious fragments of microorganisms or whole microorganisms which have been killed or weakened so that they cannot cause disease. By introducing these into the body, the humoral and/or cellular immune responses are triggered and memory cells are produced. Issues in the development of an AIDS vaccine One of the key problems faced by vaccine researchers is the relative weakness of the body's immune response to HIV. Infected people are unable to fight off the infection, and the immune system is overcome by the virus. The worst case scenario is that vaccines will be unable to stimulate the immune system sufficiently to slow down the course of disease in infected people, or to prevent infection in the as-yet uninfected. However, animal tests suggest that successful vaccination is indeed a possibility. TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES 75 [Page 76](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/82?q1=directories) It is currently unknown whether a successful HIV vaccine would need to stimulate humoral immunity, cellular immunity or both. Greater understanding of the immune response to HIV infection should help answer this question. The ability of a vaccine to prevent infection may also depend in part on the method by which the individual person is exposed to HIV. Vaccines that are given by injection will mainly protect the bloodstream from being infected. A special feature of HIV vaccine development is that some vaccines may be given into the vagina or anus. It will be important to test the effectiveness of the protective response against mucosal infection (as happens in sex) as well as against infection directly into the blood-stream. A key problem for vaccine researchers is ensuring that their vaccines are safe. In the past, monkeys have been used to test vaccines. But monkeys respond very differently to HIV; experiments really need to be done on human volunteers. Chimpanzees are the only monkeys which can be infected with HIV, but they have differences in their immune systems that do not make them directly comparable to humans. The emphasis has now switched to using human volunteers in vaccine studies, and several are under way across the world. Researchers can monitor volunteers' immune responses to vaccines using blood tests; however, they also need to ensure that the individual has not been infected with HIV following vaccination, which would also induce an immune response which could confuse the tests. Types of vaccine There are several different possible ways of producing a vaccine. Live attenuated vaccines are made from viral particles whose virulence has been lessened. The theory is that they will imitate a real infection, and so prompt the immune system to respond, but will be sufficiently weak that they will be killed rather than cause disease. The 'memory' response should then be in place ready to respond quickly and destroy any real virus particles which may enter the body. Live attenuated vaccines carry the risk that the viral particles might mutate and recover their original virulence. In theory this can be prevented by making irreversible changes to their genes which mutations will be unable to undo. There is also a risk that the procedure to attenuate, or weaken, the virus might not work properly. Both of these difficulties can only be overcome by trying out vaccine preparations in people, and with a virus as dangerous as HIV, this is clearly out of the question. Recombinant vaccines are products of genetic engineering. They use a live, harmless 'vector' organism, into which certain genes from infectious viruses have been introduced. In the body, these viral genes produce viral proteins, but are harmless because no other parts of the virus are present. The idea is that the presence of the viral proteins will prompt an immune response that would also recognise the real virus. Killed vaccines consist of the whole virus which has been treated with chemicals, heat or other processes to kill it and render it uninfectious. Again the theory is that injecting it into the body will prime the immune system to recognise the real, unkilled virus. This is the principle of the Salk 76 TREATMENT AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES HIV-immunogen vaccine, currently being tested. There have also been promising results using whole killed SIV as a vaccine in monkeys. However, the use of whole killed HIV in humans has been dogged by concerns about its safety, and the need to ensure that the virus really is killed. Sub-unit vaccines represent a similar vaccination strategy to that of recombinant vaccines. In this case, the genes which produce selected viral proteins are grafted into bacteria, cell-lines or even insects, which subsequently produce quantities of the viral protein. The protein itself is then injected into the body, to stimulate an immune response. There have been many different suggestions concerning precisely which HIV proteins should be used. One approach is to use the proteins which appear earliest in the course of viral replication, to stimulate an immune response in the very earliest stages in the event of infection with real HIV. Another approach would be to induce an immune response against the proteins which are present on the surface on infected cells during the latent period, hopefully destroying infected cells before the virus within them could replicate. Another, more conventional vaccine strategy is the stimulation of neutralising antibodies. Injecting animals with gpl 20, gpl 60 or the V3 peptide loop has produced neutralising responses which have protected the animals against a test dose of purified virus. In chimpanzee studies, no vaccine which fails to produce a strong neutralising antibody response in animals has been shown to offer protection against infection. However, anti-HIV neutralising antibodies have not been shown to have any effect on HIV in infected people. Rather than using whole viral proteins, it may also be possible to use fragments of the proteins. These are called synthetic peptides - short sequences of amino acids which can be produced by chemical synthesis. However, they are only able to induce a feeble immune response. A drawback is that a single peptide will not be present in all the different strains of HIV found around the world. So while a single peptide vaccine may provide good protection against some strains of HIV, it would probably leave people vulnerable to other strains. One possible solution would be to use a synthetic vaccine which contains all the parts of the virus which are conserved (stay the same) in every viral strain, such as the Gly-pro-Gly area on the V3 loop discussed above. However, to date no vaccine has been able successfully to induce neutralising antibodies against this site. Phase I and II trials have shown that all vaccine candidates tested to date evoke humoral immune responses. Nearly all trial participants have developed binding antibodies, which 'tag' foreign antigens for recognition by other parts of the immune system. Antibodies which neutralise HIV in vitro have also been observed, but only occasionally, and usually these antibodies have been effective only against the specific HIV strain from which the vaccine preparation was derived. Virtually all vaccine trials have reported increased T cell proliferation, indicating that immunological memory has been achieved. However, the production of cytotoxic CD8 cells has only been seen in a very limited number of trial participants. Generating CD8 cells is thought to be of much greater importance than general T cell proliferation for establishing a protective immune response.

The purchasers are either general practitioners who control their own budget (fund holders) ore commissioning agents within a district health authority. They are responsible for purchasing health care services for either their patients in a fund holding GP practice or the population living within the boundaries of the health authority. As well as ensuring that services are available they also influence the quality, type and volume of the services and determine with whom the contract is placed. The primary providers of health care are general practitioners while specialised care and clinical support services are provided by acute hospitals or community services. For most medical problems which need specialist care or advice, general practitioner refer directly to the trust hospital with whom either themselves as a fund holder or their local health authority hold a contract with. However, for certain services neither the residency status of a patient or a GP referral affects access to medical care provided by a hospital or community trust. For example, if you have an accident or become acutely unwell you can go to the nearest accident and emergency department and receive treatment irrespective of where you live. The local health authority responsible for the casualty department must ensure and pay for open access to accident and emergency services for all patients who attend. This principal of self referral also applies to clinics specialising in treating sexually transmitted diseases (genitourinary medicine clinics). The reasons for this include the need to maintain patient confidentiality and anonymity and for more effective public health control of infectious diseases. With the advent of AIDS, health care services for people infected with HIV have largely been provided by GUM clinics and the principles of open access and confidentiality have been maintained. GETTING TREATMENT 77 [Page 78](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/84?q1=directories) The development of HIV/AIDS services In view of perceived social stigma, treatment of sexually transmitted infections are available by self referral to special clinics, variously termed genitourinary medicine or sexually transmitted disease clinics, without the need for a referral by a GP. Self referral or open access allows for both confidentiality and anonymity of patients seeking treatment and both was and still is deemed essential for effective public health control of sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis and gonorrhoea. Without these measures individuals might not seek treatment so quickly or allow their sexual partners to be contacted, screened and treated resulting in an increased rate of transmission and cases of infection. For the same reasons of social stigma and the desire for confidentiality and anonymity, persons seeking testing and treatment for HIV infection at the onset of the epidemic, particularly gay men, presented at GUM clinics for treatment. This resulted in these clinics developing the expertise and their staff the knowledge and the skills necessary to manage HIV disease. This process, particularly in London, was driven by the increasing number of persons who were found to be HIV infected and by the demands of patients, their advocacy groups and health care professions. In response the government made available extra funds (ring-fenced monies) to help develop HIV/AIDS services for treatment and prevention. The distribution of funds was partly determined by the number of patients attending or being treated at each centre. The services that became and remain available include special outpatient clinics, designated inpatient wards, daycare facilities, counselling and psychology services, community care teams linked to the specialist centres, community nurse specialists, hospice and respite facilities and improved services for drug users. Throughout this development the principle of an open access and confidential service has been maintained helped both by the provision of ring-fenced funds and the current contracting arrangements between purchasers and providers which is independent of where a patient lives. Ring-fenced funds for treatment costs ended in April 1994 and for HIV prevention work will discontinue in April 1995. The level of funding of these services and their future will be determined by the local health authority (commissioning agents) and will thus compete with all of the other demands for provision of health care services on finite funds. There are concerns that the present quality and volume of services including specialist centres and the principle of open access and patient choice, particularly for inpatient care may be threatened by these changes. It is essential that whatever changes take place that many of the attributes of the current service are continued and indeed improved upon for the benefit of all persons infected with HIV throughout the UK. Medical services available Specialist HIV & GUM centres As HIV has largely been sexually transmitted, health care services in the UK have mostly been developed mostly through and provided by genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics. In certain areas of the UK existing departments of infectious diseases and clinical immunology have been developed as specialist HIV departments within hospitals. Other services which have been involved include haematology departments who care for haemophiliacs, services for drug users, and specialist children hospitals. Clearly, the number of people infected and how they were infected has determined the type and level of service within different areas of the UK. Thus, as the majority of AIDS cases within the UK have occurred within London there are several major specialist HIV centres within different hospitals in London. Most of these centres will have designated outpatient and inpatient services and will either have developed or have links with community care services. Outpatient Clinics In nearly all the large centres in London and throughout many areas in the UK these form part of, or are attached to, GUM clinics. These are open access clinics and persons can either telephone directly for an appointment or attend and asked to be seen. If the HIV specialist clinic in your area is not part of a genitourinary medicine service, the ability to self refer should remain. These clinics provide a high level of expertise in the management of different aspects of HIV disease. They will also have counselling services usually provided by health advisors and have either designated or access to clinical psychologists. Referral to medical specialists such as ophthalmologists, neurologists, dermatologists and dental services will be available and at the larger centres may entail designated clinics and staff. Prescriptions for drug treatments are free and at the larger centres participation in clinical trials and research studies is available. 78 GETTING TREATMENT [Page 79](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/85?q1=directories) In addition to the range of services provided you may be interested in the availability of clinical trials, the arrangements for inpatient care and the links with community and palliative care services. You should also find out about the opening times of the clinics, how easy is it to make an appointment, what arrangements are there for emergency access during the day (eg walk in emergency clinics) and for the evening, night and weekends for urgent problems should they arise. Accessibility of the clinic by public or private transport, availability of car parking space and how long it routinely take to travel there may also influence choice of clinic. This is particularly important for patients with symptomatic disease who might find it more difficult to attend as they become more unwell. The factors which influence choice will vary from person to person. For some the level expertise and reputation of a clinic are more important and for others it is the convenience and accessibility of the clinic. At present the choice of an outpatient clinic is not dependent on the area you live in. Individuals may attend which ever clinic they choose. If you do decide to change clinics it is often important to ask for a summary of your medical notes to be forwarded from your old to your new clinic. Frequent changing of clinics is not recommended as this may lead to interrupted continuity of care and less than ideal management of clinical problems. However, whichever clinic you attend it is important to have confidence in the quality of care provided and develop a good relationship with the staff of the clinic particularly your usual doctor. Loss of confidence is a good reason for considering changing your clinic, although why this may have occurred should be discussed with your doctor. Other common reasons for changing include the convenience and accessibility of the clinic and the availability of experimented treatments in clinical trials. Inpatients Depending on the size and number of HIV positive patients a hospital centre provides care for, the inpatient facilities may vary from a specialist inpatient ward to 1 or 2 designated beds on an acute general medical or infectious disease ward. Irrespective of size they should all be attached to a large acute hospital which has the full range of diagnostic and specialist services, including an intensive care unit. Equally the medical and nursing staff on the ward may be specialists in HIV medicine or may be nominated physicians and staff whose responsibility it is to look after patients with HIV in each district general hospital. All inpatient services should provide a good standard of care for the treatment of the common complications of HIV disease including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The delivery of this care depends on the training, skill and experience of the medical and nursing staff and those in other support services. Staff should have an insight into the special problems - both physical and psychological - that often occur in patients with HIV infection and be aware of how to deal with them. The nursing staff in particular have an important role in ensuring the well being of their patients and helping reduce stress and anxiety caused by hospital admission. The inpatient staff should also have strong links with outpatient and community care services to ensure that the continuing care of the patient is maintained. For the larger centres with specialist inpatient services, the staff will have greater experience, skill and expertise in treating both the common and uncommon complications of HIV disease. Their support staff such as pharmacists, dieticians and physiotherapists are also likely to be specialist in HIV treatment and the diagnostic services (eg in imaging, virology) will have greater experience in HIV medicine. As with other illnesses and diseases (such as cancer) it has been shown that those centres who treat larger numbers of patients and have specialist expertise have improved survival and outcome for their patients. For some people though, an admission to a designated specialist inpatient ward causes problems with loss of anonymity which may be less if they are admitted to a general medical ward. In addition, some specialist centres may be a long way from the patient's home which makes visiting by friends and relatives difficult, and on discharge liaison with local and community services will be more difficult. The choice of which hospital usually depends on where someone has received their outpatient care and as with other services may be determined by the confidence they have in their medical carers and their priorities in health care. Community Care Teams These are medical and nursing teams that provide specialist care to patients at home. They may consist of doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, dietitians, physiotherapists and social workers. At the larger centres specialist HIV teams were formed in response to the need to provide care in the community. Elsewhere these services are integrated into the existing generic palliative care services. Community Care Teams enable specialist care to be given at home avoiding admission to hospital or to other residential units such as hospices. The degree of support and care that is needed for each patient will determine whether this is both appropriate and possible to be given at home. If an acute infection or problem arises then admission to hospital for intensive treatment may be needed. Alternatively if nursing care at home becomes difficult, admission to a hospice may be necessary. Community care teams are usually able to help with problems such using Hickman lines and portacaths, giving intravenous infusions of treatment and helping with the practical problems of incontinence, diarrhoea and immobility. They often have doctors who are specialists in palliative medicine, who have expertise in symptom control particularly pain. Other members of the team include occupational therapists who can assess the need for and provide aids that help with the mobility and safety of someone in their home (such as walking aids, hand rails). These teams should have strong links with the local inpatient and outpatient services, the patient's GP and local hospices and will be able to refer or admit to these services as and when necessary. They may also have social workers or welfare rights workers in the team who will liaise with local council services or voluntary organisations to provide help with housing, finance and daily activities such as cleaning and preparing meals. Local councils will have their own home support teams who help deal with practical problems of living at home. GETTING TREATMENT 79 [Page 80](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/86?q1=directories) Access to community care teams is by referral from staff in outpatient or inpatient services or from GPs, and social workers. General practitioners For most medical problems general practitioners provide primary health care and will only refer to hospital or community services should the patient need specialist advice or treatment. Each GP has a list of patients who live locally to his or her surgery for whom she/he has the responsibility of providing medical care and referral to other health services. Traditionally the GP as the 'family doctor' has a much better understanding and insight into his patient's overall medical and social problems and needs than that of the hospital specialist and so is an essential component for the provision of medical care. However in the development of AIDS/HIV services the role of the GP in patient care was marginalised and often initially associated with misconceptions. As AIDS/HIV was a new disease patients often felt their GPs had no knowledge or experience of HIV. There was also experience of prejudice against certain population groups such as gay men and injecting drug users. Concerns over perceived lack of confidentiality was a common reason given for patients not involving their GPs. As with other sexually transmitted diseases AIDS was a cause for social stigma and patients therefore felt far more comfortable in the open access, confidential and anonymous GUM service. There are, however, very good reasons to involve GPs particularly where home support or community care is needed or preferred. With improved training, expertise and experience GPs are now more willing to become involved and are able to bring different skills to those provided by specialist centres to the care of the patient. Why get a GP? There are several reasons why registering with a GP and telling them of your diagnosis may be beneficial. The GP surgery will be more accessible and usually open in the evening for appointments. GPs can visit you at home and are a responsible for providing 24 hour access to medical care. For people who are largely asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms of HIV infection they are an alternative to the specialist clinics for sorting out and treating general problems. In patients with advanced HIV disease, GPs are invaluable in helping to provide home support in association with specialist community care teams and nurses. They can help co-ordinate the local services needed for palliative care at home and if necessary arrange admission to a hospital or hospice. They can help with the prescription of drugs including treatments that hospitals may find too expensive to provide such as intermate infusion services. In this situation shared care between the specialist centres and GPs can prove very successful and fruitful. As with all medical services the GPs involvement very much depends on their willingness and ability to take on these responsibilities and the confidence that a patient will have in his/her doctor to provide the type of care that they need. In London, because of the specialist HIV centres, community care teams and hospices there may seem little need or reason for a GP to be involved but they are an invaluable medical resource and should be part of the team that provide care for a patient. Registering with a GP Every person has the right to register with a local doctor and a list can be obtained either from your local library, health centre, Community Health Council or the Family Health Services Authority. Often the HIV outpatient services will be able to recommend a GP in your area who they know has had previous experience, are willing to be involved and are sympathetic to the needs of someone with HIV infection. When choosing a doctor, as well as ensuring you have confidence in their abilities to help you, it is also important to look at how the practice is run, i.e. considering what time are surgery hours, is the surgery within walking distant and what are the arrangements for emergency cover. Registration on a doctor's practice list may either be permanent if you have been living in his area for more than 3 months, or you have reason to believe that you will be doing so, or maybe temporary for up to a period of 3 months should you be living away from your permanent address or in temporary accommodation. You can change doctors at any time by asking another GP if he or she will take you on as a patient and you do not need to inform your present doctor to do this. A GP can refuse to take you on his/her list and if you are unable to find a local GP then the Family Health Service Authority will arrange for a doctor to accept you. Hospice care The hospice movement was developed in response to the need to look after people in the last stages of an incurable illness and who could no longer be helped by medical treatment. Their aim in the care of a dying patient is to provide dignity, security and emotional/psychological support in the last stages of life. Although a small number are run by the NHS or receive financial support from health authorities, the majority are run by voluntary organisations and charities and are, therefore autonomous and independent. Some hospices only take patients who have cancer while others have in past been very unwilling to accept individuals with AIDS. Specialist hospices for the care of patients with AIDS have been set up in parts of the UK where there has been a greater need. In London these are the London Lighthouse and the Mildmay Mission Hospital. They receive money from the NHS but are also charitable trusts. There are several situations where hospice care may be appropriate, these are: * Convalescence after a serious illness. * Where extensive nursing and non-acute medical care is needed, but admission to an acute hospital would be inappropriate (palliative care). * Where a rest or break from care at home is needed by either patient or carer (respite care). 80 GETTING TREATMENT [Page 81](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/87?q1=directories) The hospice will help with the control and palliation of distressing symptoms such as pain, and help meet the psychological and emotional needs of patient, carers, partners and families. Medical staff in hospices are often specialist in palliative care medicine or are local GPs who have a special interest in hospice work. Other members of the staff include nurses, counsellors, social workers, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and chaplains. All these people work towards minimising symptoms and improving the daily quality of life for patients with terminal illness. It is important to remember that they do not provide acute medical care and if this thought to be necessary and appropriate then the patient would be transferred to a specialist acute unit. Hospices can also provide access to alternative or complementary therapies such as massage and aromatherapy and offer bereavement counselling and support for partners and carers. Admission to a hospice is by referral from GPs, hospital consultants, community care teams or social workers. Some hospices accept direct referrals by patients or their carers. A list of local hospices is available through your GP or specialist HIV services. What to expect from your doctor Whether this is your GP or doctor at the hospital or clinic the following are important in developing trust and confidence in the care you receive. * The level of expertise in treating and managing HIV related problems: This may depend on the grade of doctor you usually see (eg consultant, senior registrar, registrar) or the role they have in providing health care (eg specialist versus GP). * Accessibility: how easy is it to make an appointment, see the doctor or contact them outside their normal clinic times. Every doctor has other responsibilities and duties and may only be available at certain or restricted times. * Their interpersonal skills: sensitivity, politeness, empathy. * Willingness to listen and act upon problems. * Ability to explain and inform: particularly about treatment options and medical tests and procedures. * Acknowledgment of deficiencies and willingness to refer to other specialist services. Monitoring and follow up Aims of regular monitoring Regular monitoring and follow up of people with HIV or AIDS is beneficial both for treatment and for coping with psychological problems. A study has recently shown that knowledge of HIV infection for a longer period prior to a diagnosis of AIDS is associated with improved survival for someone with HIV infection. However, the role and purpose of regular monitoring will vary at different stages of HIV infection. Natural history One purpose of monitoring is to assess how much damage HIV might have done to the immune system and to determine over time what is the likelihood or risk of progression to AIDS or developing specific HIV related problems. The level of CD4 count is or how quickly it is falling will influence when prophylactic treatments are started to prevent occurrence of certain opportunistic infections or when anti-retroviral treatment should be commenced. In addition this information can influence decisions about whether to give up work, change career options or redefine priorities in how a person leads and lives their life. Diagnosis Regular monitoring makes earlier diagnosis of potentially serious problems easier. Follow up will allow appropriate investigation and treatment of symptoms, knowledge of the CD4 count might influence which investigations to undertake and will help to determine what is the right diagnosis and treatment. For example, patients presenting with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia are more likely to present and be treated earlier if they are in regular follow up and are able to access specialist services quickly. Monitoring of treatment effect It is important when starting new treatments that the effect of the drugs are monitored with adequate follow up. This is not only to see whether there has been a response to treatment but also to monitor for side effects or toxicity which may require altering the dose of the drug or stopping it. For example, patients started on zidovudine need to have a full blood count to monitor for development of anaemia or neutropenia due to toxic affects on the bone marrow. GETTING TREATMENT 81 [Page 82](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/88?q1=directories) One controversial point is the role of monitoring the CD4 count in response to treatment with anti-retroviral therapy. For example, the overall benefit of treatment with zidovudine is not always reflected in a rise in CD4 count. Also the Concorde study showed that despite a rise in CD4 count in patients treated with zidovudine immediately there was overall no benefit at 3 years in starting treatment early. Care therefore needs to be taken in placing too much emphasis on what the CD4 count does in response to treatment and whether this predicts the likelihood of remaining well. Clearly though a rapidly falling CD4 count in someone would suggest treatment failure and progression of disease. Psychological support HIV infection can be accompanied by marked psychological and emotional problems. Regular monitoring and follow up can help to reduce these problems by giving access to specialist counselling and psychological services or simply by discussing and giving information on any aspect related to the patients health. The provision of information which allows patients to make informed decisions and choices is an important task of monitoring and helps to allay anxiety and stress associated with the uncertainty and fear of HIV infection. Different diagnoses First diagnosis of HIV infection When HIV infection is first diagnosed then there are several important issues that need to be addressed. One of these, but not necessarily the most important for every patient, is an assessment of which stage of infection they are at and how severely the immune system has been affected. This is done by taking a history of any symptoms and examining for any signs of HIV disease that are markers for progression. Laboratory and medical tests will be carried out and include general blood tests such as a blood count, tests for liver and kidney function and a CD4 count to assess the immune system. Other tests may include blood tests to identify previous infection with syphilis, toxoplasmosis and hepatitis B virus and a chest X-ray to help assess the possible risk of tuberculosis especially if someone has come from an area in the world of high prevalence. Apart from this medical assessment, other important tasks are to provide information and psychological support both for the patient and partner, dealing with practical problems such as housing, welfare and support. During this period of initial diagnosis patients will usually be seen and assessed more frequently. Asymptomatic (symptom free) The follow up of someone who has HIV infection and is well and symptom free can be as frequent or infrequent as a person requires. One of the most important tasks is to monitor the CD4 count; this is usually done 1- 4 times per year. The CD4 count and the identification of early symptoms and signs of HIV disease are important for deciding when to start prophylaxis against PCP and when to discuss the choices of antiretroviral therapy. As with other stages of the disease monitoring at this time also helps to provide information, update people on new treatments and allay anxiety and fears over symptoms that may be unrelated to HIV disease. Symptomatic disease The main task for people with symptomatic disease is to investigate symptoms, diagnose and treat problems and monitor the response to treatment, paying particular attention to the side effects of drugs. Regular follow up at this stage can lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment which can result in improved outcome and less time spent in hospital. The development of symptoms or a diagnosis of AIDS can be accompanied by psychological and emotional crises which need more intensive counselling and support. Help in making decisions about work, careers, housing etc may also be needed. The usual frequency that someone will attend is once every 4-8 weeks. Advanced disease The provision of care for someone with advanced disease may shift from outpatient services to the home, with involvement of community care teams and GPs. Priorities here are very different: for example there is little point in measuring the CD4 count regularly as the result will not influence diagnosis and treatment options. Clinical assessment should involve early diagnosis and screening for CMV retinitis and MAI infection. Important tasks include controlling symptoms and monitoring the side effects, interaction and effect of different drugs dealing with the psychological, emotional and spiritual needs of the patient and trying to improve their daily quality of life. As with other medical problems the frequency of follow up and medical monitoring depends upon a person's priorities and attitude to health care and disease and their willingness to undertake and accept certain treatments and support. This will vary from person to person and there is no one correct way for individuals to cope and deal with the problems of HIV disease. 82 GETTING TREATMENT [Page 83](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/89?q1=directories) Obtaining drugs Summary of options If you discover a drug which you decide you want to try, there are four main ways in which you could go about getting it. * Prescription * Clinical trials * Named patient basis * Buyers' clubs. Drugs on prescription An increasing number of drugs are now being licensed for the treatment of HIV and opportunistic infections following trials establishing their effectiveness. However, drugs get approved at different times in different countries. Some drugs which have been approved in the UK for other uses are also now used to treat AIDS, without specific trials having been needed. There is also disagreement about the best ways to use approved drugs, or the best approved drug to use in particular circumstances. Doctors may disagree on these matters in good faith. Your doctor can prescribe any drug listed in the British National Formulary, the guide to drugs licensed for use in the UK. This includes vitamins and protein/carbohydrate supplements, which is particularly useful if you are entitled to free prescriptions. However, some items like antifungal shampoos for chronic dandruff and skin preparations for HIV-related skin disorders are often cheaper bought over the counter rather than on prescription if you pay prescription charges. People on income support or invalidity benefit do not pay prescription charges. If your doctor has not already suggested or offered you an approved drug, it is possible that he/she has not heard of it or has simply overlooked it in your case. The best thing to do is to make sure you are clear about all the arguments about the drug and then to tactfully suggest that you should be on it. Remember that in general doctors are very unused to having their patients suggesting treatments. This is because they have been trained to both diagnose and treat illnesses with minimal input from the patient. They may feel disgruntled if you give the impression you know more than they do about a particular field. However people with HIV have made big efforts to educate themselves about their infection and many experts in HIV concede that there is a two way flow of information between doctors and their patients. You may like to take along evidence that you think suggests you should be on the drug such as trial reports. Make sure your doctor explains clearly any reasons for not wanting to prescribe the drug in question. If he/she say no to a drug it is probably because he/she may not know about it or because there is a medical reason against it. Try and find out which of these is the case. (It is possible that a GP or a hospital doctor may say no to a drug because of expense e.g. erythropoietin or other cytokines). If you are still not satisfied, you may wish to change your doctor. This is not a very desirable outcome, especially if you have been seeing your doctor for some time; a slowly developed doctor patient relationship is irreplaceable. But if you cannot convince them a drug is right for you and they cannot offer a good reason (or vice versa), then something has gone seriously wrong with the two way learning process and you need to think again. Clinical trials Clinical trials of experimental therapies are taking place at centres all over the country. Some are large 'multi-centre' trials coordinated by the Medical Research Council; others are smaller studies taking place at only one or a few individual treatment centres. These trials are listed in the A-Z of clinical trials. The A-Z of treatment centres should allow you to find out precisely which trials are available at centres near you. Although clinical trials are often used by people with HIV as a means of gaining access to unapproved therapies, they are not usually designed as such; rather, the researchers are trying to answer particular questions about the safety, behaviour in the body and effectiveness of the therapy. This means that trial designs will be intended to provide these answers as quickly and as decisively as possible, perhaps by using a placebo control arm in which participants do not receive the genuine trial therapy. It is unethical for trials to be designed in such a way that participants may be denied treatment that is of proven value to them; but although proven treatments will not be denied, trial participants may find themselves placed in the arm which is not offering the experimental treatment which they wish to receive. Some trials are quite complicated, comparing a number of different treatment options, and usually participants are randomly assigned to join one particular arm of the trial. These trials are not an efficient means of gaining access to treatment for the person who has already decided that they wish to try a particular one of the treatments being tested. For example, the MRC's Delta trial was not a good means of providing access to the combination of AZT plus ddC, because participants may have been allocated AZT alone or AZT plus ddl instead. Even if they got into the AZT plus ddC arm, they would not have known whether they were GETTING TREATMENT 83 [Page 84](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/90?q1=directories) receiving real ddC or the dummy ddC-lookalike placebo pills. Every trial has inclusion and exclusion criteria, which define who is eligible to join. If you are eligible and the trial still appeals to you, you need to get access to the centre doing the trial. If this happens to be the hospital you are attending anyway, all well and good. If you are not attending the hospital where the trial is underway, you need to get an appointment there. If the trial is being done in a department of Genitourinary Medicine, you have a right to walk into a clinic and find out more. If the study is being conducted in a hospital department which is not a GUM department (eg Clinical Immunology, Infectious Diseases or Paediatrics) you may not be able just to turn up, but may need to be referred by your General Practitioner. Try checking with the trial centre first to find out if GP referral is really necessary. If so, you will then need to convince your GP that the trial is a good idea for you. If all this succeeds, you will then get an appointment at the department that is doing the trial. These steps would all be very difficult if you were a hospital inpatient. If this is the case and you are quite ill, talk things over with your Consultant. It may still be possible that the doctors may not allow you into the trial. It could already be fully enrolled, or perhaps you have blood test results or are on other drugs that mean you would be excluded. If this is the case and the trial doctors do think that you would benefit from the drug, then they are in a good position to get you the drug on a 'named patient basis', sometimes called compassionate release. For a more detailed discussion of joining trials see the next chapter on Clinical trials. Named patient basis Named patient basis prescribing is a scheme which allows a doctor to prescribe an unlicensed drug to a particular 'named patient'. It is only an option for drugs whose manufacturer is prepared to release it on this basis, and has to be arranged by the doctor on an individual basis. Some companies are unwilling to release unapproved drugs in this way. The next step is for your doctor to find out what conditions are attached to the use of the drug. The drug company may require you to have passed certain medical tests before providing the drug, in order to avoid damaging side effects. For instance, if someone wants ddl they will have to undergo tests to ensure that they will not be vulnerable to pancreatitis. The doctor must inform the patient that the drug has unproven benefits and that there are unknown risks attached to the use of the drug. This protects a doctor against liability. A GP can only be proved liable if he/she has not taken reasonable steps to treat you according to his/her experience and knowledge of the particular illness. This distributes the responsibility between you and your doctor when choosing an experimental therapy, but doesn't protect you against incompetence. If you want to use a drug on a named patient basis, you may feel more confident doing it under the supervision of a doctor who has some experience of treating HIV disease. Similarly, a doctor with little experience in this field may be more reluctant, for entirely ethical reasons, to prescribe drugs on this basis. In this case, you might want to find a new doctor. Buyers' clubs Buyers' clubs are community groups that have been set up in a number of countries, but particularly the United States. They were formed by people with HIV who were frustrated either that drugs in the States cost much more than the same drugs in other countries, or because drugs that were unavailable in the States could be obtained from elsewhere. In buyers' clubs, people with HIV pooled their resources to bulk-buy treatments more cheaply, or to import drugs for resale at cost price in the States. Buyers' clubs have tended to be particularly unfairly misrepresented by the media, who portray them as groups of desperate, ill-informed people driven to various kinds of medical extremism by their plight. In reality, the major buyers' clubs are professionally run small, not for profit businesses, meeting a real need for well-informed people who have decided what treatments they want, but are unable to obtain them in any other way. Unfortunately most buyers' clubs do not now sell their products to overseas customers. If they do, they will require the customer to have a prescription signed by their doctor or some other form of proof that they will receive proper medical supervision when taking the drug.The drug may have to be shipped to a third party within the country that the buyers club operates from to be re shipped to the end user. This may not be required when the drug in question is demonstrably safe, like some vitamin or mineral supplements or products such as AL-721. In the UK, the Medicines Act allows individuals to import a quantity of licensed or experimental medicines for their own use, as long as the quantity is a sensible supply for one person's use. Substances of abuse or controlled drugs may not be imported. In the 1990s buyers' clubs became one of the leading suppliers of the anti-HIV drug ddC when its pharmaceutical manufacturer, Roche, failed to offer trials or expanded access mechanisms that enabled all the people who wanted ddC to obtain it. Controversy surrounded the quality of the ddC sold by buyers' clubs, which was manufactured on the 'black market' in Europe. However, researchers have subsequently shown that despite substantial dose variations between supposedly identical tablets, no-one seems to have come to any harm from buyers' club ddC, and many people benefited. If purchasing from a buyers' club, it is sensible to tell your doctor - in many cases you will require your doctor's written approval to obtain the drug; and stick to the well-established buyers' clubs which have quality control measures. 84 GETTING TREATMENT [Page 85](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/91?q1=directories) Taking drugs Methods of administration In order to reach the part of the body where their activity is desired, many drugs are designed to enter the bloodstream so that they are transported throughout the body. This is called systemic administration. The way in which the drug gets into the blood determines how fast the drug is absorbed and the peak concentration achieved. The drug is likely to have its greatest effect at the point at which levels of the drug reach a peak concentration in the blood. The study of this is called pharmacokinetics. It is not always necessary for the drug to enter the blood if it can be delivered to the part of the body where it is needed by another means. For example, aerosolised pentamidine for PCP prophylaxis can be inhaled directly into the lungs, and ganciclovir can be injected directly into the sclera of the eye for treatment of CMV retinitis. The disadvantage of these direct application techniques is that protection does not extend to areas not directly treated. Thus, inhaled aerosolised pentamidine may not protect against PCP in the upper areas of the lung where the pentamidine droplets tend not to deposit, and PCP can sometimes develop in other parts of the body outside the lungs. Administration by mouth In British medical practice, most drugs are given by mouth. Most drugs given by mouth are absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine. The speed and extent of drug absorption is dependent on several factors. In general liquids tend to be absorbed faster than tablets which have first to break up ('disperse') before they can be absorbed. The presence of food may delay the absorption of drugs. In some cases this may mean that not enough of the drug is absorbed; to avoid this, some drug instructions say 'Take on an empty stomach'. However, in other instances the presence of food may be a protective factor; for example, the nausea commonly associated with AZT may be decreased when the drug is taken with food because it is absorbed more slowly. Some drugs should be taken after meals to take advantage of the buffering effect of food. For example, the group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that includes aspirin and naproxen have a corrosive effect on the lining of the gut which may be minimised by giving them after food, especially proteins such as milk. Once the drugs are absorbed they pass into the liver through the portal vein. This is part of the system of digestion. Digestion limits the types of drugs that can be given orally. Drugs which consist of proteins, such as peptide T, are usually destroyed by the digestive process. Drugs may also be partially destroyed in the liver by enzymes; this effect is known as 'first pass loss', and an example is testosterone. In such cases the drugs may have to be given by injection instead. Some drugs - such as foscarnet - are very difficult to absorb from the gut and may have to be given by injection instead. Some useful tips: * Tablets and capsules have to be swallowed. It is not advisable to put more in your mouth than you can swallow. So you should not try to swallow too many tablets at one time. It is generally a good thing to swallow the tablets in a standing or a least sitting position, since this uses gravity to help the drugs down the oesophagus. Try to drink at least a glassful of fluid with each batch of tablets. If you try to swallow them dry or with little fluid there is a chance that some may lodge in the oesophagus where they may have a corrosive effect. * If you have difficulty swallowing it may be useful to wash down the tablets with a semi-liquid food such as yoghurt. * Liquid diet supplements such as Ensure and Fresubin can be a bit nauseating when consumed in quantity and can benefit from chilling which seems to help them go down. * Mouth ulcers can make many aspects of life miserable, including taking drugs. Pain may be minimised by covering the ulcer with a barrier compound such as Orabase. Rectal administration Drugs intended to have a systemic effect may be placed in the rectum from where they may be absorbed into the bloodstream. Some drugs are produced in the form of suppositories, and other as retention enemas (when a liquid is inserted into the rectum and held there until it is absorbed). Drugs intended to have a local effect on the rectum may also be given by this route. Absorption may, however, be less than by the oral route. This can be useful if only a limited local effect is required. For example, retention enemas of the immune-suppressing steroid prednisolone are used to treat rectal inflammation; the reduced absorption prevents the drug from having a systemic steroid effect which is not sought after in persons with HIV and decreased immunity. Rectal administration is also useful when drugs cannot be taken by mouth because of vomiting. However, the rectal route is unsuitable for use by people who have diarrhoea which may mean that suppositories may be expelled after a short time and thus insufficient drug may be absorbed. Inhalation Many drugs can be inhaled. The advantages are that the effect is local to the lungs and that the effect is often very rapid. Drugs that relax the airways (bronchodilators) such as Ventolin are commonly used to treat asthma and are also useful when given before inhaled pentamidine to prevent bronchospasm or difficulty in breathing. GETTING TREATMENT 85 [Page 86](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/92?q1=directories) Drugs may be inhaled using different techniques. Aerosol inhalers are commonly use to deliver asthma drugs. These are little hand-held aerosol canisters (called \"puffers\" by some patients). Another technique is nebulisation: this is the name given to a method by which the drug in solution is converted into a fine mist which is then inhaled by the patient so that the drug is deposited in the fine airways of the lung. The commonest drug used by in nebulised form by people with HIV is pentamidine, as a form of PCP prophylaxis. Different types of nebulisers produce different sizes of droplets, and since finer droplets are better able to penetrate and deliver drug to the entire lung the choice of nebuliser is an important consideration. Machines that produce very fine droplets tend to be very expensive and for this reason treatment is often centralised in hospital outpatient departments. People receiving nebulised drugs can also breath out the drug when they exhale, which may irritate the eyes and noses of health care staff. For this reason exhaled breath is often piped out through a window. Posture is also an important factor in ensuring uniform treatment of the entire lung. A supine (lying on your back) posture seems to be best. Injection Many drugs may be given by injection. The advantages are that the effects of the drug are rapidly achieved, the peak concentrations may be higher (this is important with antibiotic treatment) and drugs which are not properly absorbed by mouth can be delivered effectively into the body. A local effect may also be attained by injection into the desired site of action e.g. ganciclovir into the sclera of the eye. The main types of injection are: * intravenous (IV) - injection into the vein. This means that the drug reaches effective levels very quickly. A variation of this is the in-dwelling central venous line such as the Hickman line which is used for the daily infusion of irritant drugs such as ganciclovir. * intramuscular (IM) - injection into the muscle. Absorption is slower and the volume of the injection is limited to about 5ml. This route may be more painful than IV. * subcutaneous (SC) - injection under the skin. This is a useful route for small volumes of drug. Interferon is commonly given this way. Topical application Topical application means applying the drug directly to the area where it is needed, usually in the form of a cream, ointment or spray. It is useful for treating localized disorders such as skin infections and sinus conditions. This can produce the maximum benefit with the minimum side effects. However, systemic absorption of the drug may occur when a large surface area is treated or when the drug is applied to broken skin. This may be a problem when a strong steroid cream such as Dermovate is used to treat HIV-related psoriasis. Drug interactions When two or more different dugs are taken together, an effect other than that achieved with the single drug may result. One drug may increase or decrease the amount of another drug that is absorbed into the body. It is advisable to check with a doctor or pharmacist before taking any new drugs. Interactions occur through different mechanisms: Altered absorption Alcohol and some drugs (especially opiates such as morphine and codeine) slow the digestive process and therefore slow absorption of the drug from the intestine. Other drugs such as metoclopramide speed up the process and may increase the speed and extent to which another drug is absorbed. Some drugs may combine with food or other drugs in the gut to form chelates - compounds which are not easily absorbed - reducing the effects of the drug. An example of this is the tetracycline group of antibiotics which form chelates with calcium in milk or certain antacids and thereby produce minimal effect. An important interaction with ddl concerns stomach acidity. ddl is broken down by stomach acid and any factors which increase gastric acidity will cause ddl absorption to be reduced. For this reason citrus juices such as orange or grapefruit should not be taken at the same time. Conversely drugs that lower stomach acidity will increase ddl absorption and possibly also increase its toxicity. Examples of drugs that do this are cimetidine, ranitidine and antacids such as Rennies and magnesium trisilicate. ddl is formulated with a buffer which neutralizes the stomach acid and allows the ddl to be absorbed; this will have a negative effect on other drugs which do need stomach acid to be absorbed, including dapsone, ketoconazole and ciprofloxacin. Sustained release (sr) preparations release the active drug slowly whilst travelling through the gut. They can provide a continuous dose of the drug over quite a long period of time. If the patient has diarrhoea the tablet may go through the entire gut without releasing very much of the drug. This can be quite a problem and the form of the drug should be changed to one which is absorbed more readily e.g use morphine solution instead of morphine sr tablets. The advantage of the sustained release tablet is then lost so the solution has to be given more often. Enzyme effects Some drugs are eliminated from the body by enzymes and their effect terminated. Other drugs can inhibit these enzymes, resulting in higher drug levels, or in other cases can induce or increase the level of the enzyme, which means that the first drug is eliminated faster. Drugs which have a potential effect on enzymes include rifabutin and ketoconazole. Rifabutin will lower the blood levels of AZT, decreasing its anti-HIV activity. Ciprofloxacin and erythromycin also have effects on drug-metabolising enzymes. Excretion via the kidney Some drugs are wholly or partially eliminated through the kidney. Any other drug that interferes with this may increase or decrease the blood levels of the first drug. For example, probenecid will decrease the amount of AZT excreted in the urine and increase the blood levels and effects. This may be 86 GETTING TREATMENT [Page 87](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/93?q1=directories) useful as the number of AZT capsules taken daily can be decreased when taken in combination with probenecid, thus decreasing drug costs. Receptor effects Drugs work in the body by acting on what is known as a receptor. An analogy is a lock and key, in which the drug (a key) fits a specific receptor (the lock). If two drugs are present in the body that both use the same receptor, it is possible that due to competition one or both may not have an effect, as though one key is in the lock preventing the other from being inserted. Additive toxicity Combinations of drugs may result in greater toxicity than would be seen with single drugs. For example, either AZT or ganciclovir used on their own have a suppressive effect on the bone marrow that decreases its ability to form red and white blood cells and platelets. If these drugs are taken at the same time the toxic effects on the bone marrow are increased, and anaemia or neutropenia may develop. Other drugs which can cause serious bone marrow inhibition when taken with AZT include co-trimoxazole, interferon, dapsone, pyrimethamine, pentamidine and cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs doxorubicin. Other additive toxicities of note are pancreatitis which can occur with ddl and ddC (alcohol can increase the likelihood of this happening) and peripheral neuropathy. Protein binding Protein binding is the name given to the effect where, once a drug has entered the bloodstream, a proportion of the drug may attach to proteins in the blood plasma. The drug attached to the protein is inactive whilst the free (unbound) fraction is active. Interactions may occur if a second drug is introduced and this dislodges the first drug from the proteins, because the effective level of the first drug will be increased, possibly causing toxicity. An example of this is when warfarin is used to prevent blood clotting and aspirin is taken. The aspirin displaces the warfarin from the protein, increasing its anti-clotting effects in the body with the result that uncontrolled bleeding may start. Directions and timing of drug doses Some medicines are designed to be taken regularly on an ongoing basis, such as antivirals and PCP prophylaxis. Others are taken only as needed for treatment of symptoms (prn in medical shorthand). Sometimes the distinction may be blurred - an aspirin may be all that is needed for an occasional headache, but regular morphine may be necessary to deal with pain caused by cancer. If you are unclear about how often and when you should take your medicines, ask a doctor or pharmacist to explain. Instructions can often be confusing; for example, does 'four times a day' mean every six hours (e.g. 8am, 2pm, 8pm, and 2am) or does it mean at equal intervals through the waking hours (morning, lunchtime, afternoon and bedtime)? The last example is usually the case. It may be convenient to arrange the doses around meal times to make it easier to remember to take them. However, it is important to find out if the drugs should be taken before, with or after food as this may affect their absorption or give rise to drug interactions. Missed doses Missing a dose of medication can be a problem if you are taking a course of medicine e.g. antibiotics. Most people with HIV tend to be on multiple continuous treatments and it is common to miss some doses which is generally not a cause for concern. Some people with long-term diseases requiring long-term treatment (such as kidney problems, diabetes or epilepsy as well as HIV) may almost deliberately forget to take medicines as a way of trying to escape the fact that they are ill. Knowing what a drug is supposed to do will help you to work out whether missing a dose is likely to matter. Many drugs are meant to be taken regularly to ensure that they are continually present in the body at an effective level, so for example missing a dose of acyclovir being taken to prevent herpes attacks may mean that the herpes may break out. In this case acyclovir should be taken as soon as it is realised that a dose has been missed. However, when you resume the dose schedule remember that it may be unwise to take two doses too soon together or a double dose, since toxicity may result. If you find that you are missing your doses during the day discuss this with your doctor as it may be possible to tailor your schedule to make it easier to remember. For example, AZT may be taken twice daily which is much easier to remember than the six times daily schedule when it was first introduced. There are devices such as Medidose, a plastic box with several compartments for each day which can be pre-loaded with tablets and capsules for up to a week in advance by the patient or a helper which make taking a multi-drug regime much easier although they can be a bit time-consuming to fill. It is possible to obtain them from hospital pharmacy departments or on special order from retail pharmacies Some pill-boxes are available which sound an alarm when it is time to take the next dose ('beepers'). These provide a convenient way to carry medication as well as reminding you of the need to take the medicine at the appropriate time. Ending drug treatment Some drugs can be stopped abruptly but others may have to be tailed off. Antibiotics should be taken until the course finishes in order to minimise the risk of bacterial resistance to the drug developing. Some people may stop taking the drug as soon as they feel better only to have the symptoms return. Some people decide to stop taking their treatments because of side-effects. Remember that it is sometimes difficult to tell if you are having an adverse effect from the drug/s or if you are feelina a bit ill due to the wear and tear of life in general or, more specifically, living with HIV. A rule of thumb is that the more drugs you take the higher the chance of having an adverse effect. Rather than suffering in silence with what you feel are adverse effects, or deciding GETTING TREATMENT 87 [Page 88](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/94?q1=directories) to stop taking the drugs on the spur of the moment, it is a good idea first to discuss the problem with your doctor as it may be possible to prevent or reduce the side-effects. Bear in mind that some drugs such as anti-depressants can cause adverse effects that are worst when you first start taking them but may then disappear over time. There are some drugs that are designed to help reduce adverse effects, such as prochlorperazine to suppress AZT-induced nausea. Corticosteroids such as prednisolone or dexamethasone must not be stopped abruptly but must be tailed off to prevent a reaction happening when the treatment is ended. An exception to this is when steroids are given for only one or two doses. You may suffer from withdrawal symptoms if you have been taking opiate drugs such as morphine, pethidine and codeine consistently for several days and then stopped abruptly. The drug should be gradually reduced over a few days. Drug storage Many people store drugs in the bathroom. This is actually the worst possible place because the drugs are subjected to hot moist conditions which are almost guaranteed to cause decomposition. Find a cool dry place to store drugs away from sunlight. Few drugs need to be stored in the fridge. It is a good idea to store the drugs in the original container in which they were dispensed. It is important to store all drugs away from small children. Tablets over two years old and any medicines that are past their expiry date or showing signs of deterioration (such as aspirins smelling of vinegar) should be disposed off safely. Ideally, take them to your pharmacist for disposal. Types of prescriptions Prescriptions are generally written by a doctor to authorise the pharmacist to give out drugs to the patient. The format may vary - GPs write on a white form known as a FP10 whilst hospital doctors may write on an orange form FP11 or on an internal prescription form which may vary from one hospital to another. It is important to remember that FP10 and FP11 forms are generally dispensed by retail pharmacies such as high street chemists (the exceptions being where the drug prescribed is only available from the hospital). Hospital prescriptions must be dispensed by the hospital pharmacy. If you take them to a retail pharmacy they cannot be dispensed. NHS prescriptions incur a fee per item which is not related to the drug cost. If the patient is on income support they are exempt from this. Some hospital pharmacies require to see some proof of signing on. If the patient is not exempt the prescription charges for several items may be substantial. This can be minimised by asking the doctor to prescribe several months' supply of drugs at the same time or by obtaining a pre-paid certificate of exemption (season ticket). Some drugs are considered of borderline benefit and have to be endorsed in order to be dispensed. These include diet supplements such as Ensure and Fresubin; this means that the doctor should write ACBS on the prescription. Some drugs you may consider to be of benefit such as Redoxon (proprietary vitamin C preparation) may be blacklisted i.e. not available on NHS prescription. However, individuals have obtained such products by asking their doctors to prescribe an ordinary drug of equivalent value, then persuading their pharmacist to dispense Redoxon instead.

Some practitioners have specialised in treating HIV-positive people, but they are few and far between. Outside London, practitioners experienced in treating HIV and AIDS-related illnesses are rare. The answers a practitioner gives to the following questions may help you decide whether he or she is suitable for you. What is the treatment you offer, and how can it benefit me? You may already have some idea of what form the treatment takes and how it works, but it's always useful to hear from the practitioner about their philosophy and practice. There are considerable variations in philosophy and practice amongst homoeopaths for instance. In every field practitioners will develop their own style of treatment according to their experience with patients. Claims of benefit need to be scrutinised very carefully. Claims that any treatment can cure AIDS completely or reverse HIV antibody status from positive to negative should make you immediately wary. Claims that individual opportunistic infections have been cured should be treated very carefully. Evaluation of new treatments or therapies is considered in more detail in the section on complementary and alternative therapies in Treatment and lifestyle choices. What is your experience of treating people with HIV or AIDS? There are three points at which an HIV-positive individual may approach a practitioner: when HIV-positive but without symptoms; when suffering symptoms of immune deficiency, and when suffering from an acute, life-threatening condition. Some practitioners see patients at each of these stages. Others tend to see only those with serious symptoms; on the other hand, some tend to see patients only with minor symptoms. All these factors influence the amount of knowledge a practitioner will have, and what they can offer you. GPs face the same problem. For instance, just because a therapist has had success in treating candida, it does not make them an expert on all HIV-related problems. Candida is a common specialism amongst complementary and alternative practitioners. On the other hand, we are unaware of any cases in which practitioners claim to have been able to treat acute cases of PCP pneumonia. If the practitioner tells you that his or her experience lies largely with HIV-positive people who are well, it can be difficult to evaluate the success of the therapy they are offering. Is it the therapy which is keeping clients well and improving quality of life, or would they have remained healthy in any case? If the practitioner tells you that his or her experience lies largely in treating people with symptoms, ask which symptoms and what difference the treatment generally makes to those conditions. Ask if you can be put in touch with other people who have been treated by this practitioner. A cooperative practitioner will be able to do this without compromising the confidentiality of clients. You will also need to find out what proof the practitioner has that the treatment works. Practitioners may seek to assure you of the effectiveness of the treatment by citing cases of success with other patients. Written testimonials are no substitute for speaking to someone about their experience of a treatment. If the practitioner gives you scientific studies to read, look at them closely. In our experience, many studies used by practitioners to 'prove' the effectiveness of a treatment do not provide sufficient support for the claims or promises they are making. For example, it is commonly claimed that vitamin C has been shown to boost the immune system. A close examination of the data will show that this is based on laboratory studies and studies in non-HIV infected people. Its effects in HIV-positive people have not been studied. Are you prepared to visit me at home or in hospital if necessary? Consider your needs. If you are hospitalised, will this practitioner come to hospital to offer advice and continue this course of treatment? In some circumstances this is possible (complementary therapists are sometimes part of the care team), although not all doctors and nursing staff are welcoming to complementary therapists. In London the Immune Development Trust runs a home visiting scheme which allows people to be treated at home by practitioners. Details are available on request. Practitioners may be resistant to visiting patients in hospital because of past experiences of poor co-operation from medical staff, and also because of the time and travelling costs involved. What experience and training do you have for diagnosing symptoms? It is important that your practitioner has a basic understanding of immune dysfunction and knows about the symptoms of AIDS-related illnesses. GETTING TREATMENT 89 [Page 90](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/96?q1=directories) If they do not have this knowledge, complementary and alternative practitioners may miss symptoms which indicate a declining immune system. A trained and experienced practitioner will notice such symptoms and advise a visit to your doctor. How much do you charge, and do you have a concessionary scheme? Charges vary according to the therapy, but broadly speaking, if you are being charged more than ~50-~60 for an initial consultation, you may be being taken for a ride. Most therapists/practitioners charge much less. An initial consultation is likely to last longer than subsequent sessions. Do not be put off if the practitioner seems to be too expensive. Ask if a concessionary scheme exists. Most practitioners have a sliding scale of charges, but virtually all take the view that the client should pay something towards their treatment even if it is only a few pounds. Free treatment may be available through a local support groups, although there may be a considerable waiting list for such services. The practitioner may also be able to tell you whether this treatment is one for which charities give financial support. If the therapy is being offered free, check the qualifications of the person offering it and whether they are affiliated to an organisation such as the Immune Development Trust. Sometimes volunteers with little training may be offering therapies through support groups in order to gain experience. Free treatment is best obtained from an experienced practitioner. How can this treatment be combined with conventional medication? It is important to tell the practitioner what treatment you are receiving from your doctor. Similarly, it is important to tell your doctor of any complementary treatment you are receiving, so that this can be taken into account when investigating possible drug interactions - or sudden improvement or deterioration in your health. Some complementary and alternative therapies are thought to be much less effective when used alongside conventional medications. For instance, some Chinese herbal remedies may not be as effective alongside certain orthodox medications. This is why it is important to talk to the therapist about the medications you are using. Other therapies may complement conventional medication far more easily. Dietary and nutritional adjustments are an example; supplementation of some vitamins may reduce the side-effects of commonly used treatment drugs. What are your qualifications? This is an important question to ask, because different professional associations have different standards of training and differing philosophies. Membership of a professional association does not always guarantee competence however. Unlike doctors and other medical professionals, complementary and alternative practitoners may not necessarily be subject to disciplinary procedures which can weed out clearly incompetent or unscrupulous practitioners. In fact, most complementary and alternative practitioners work relatively unsupervised and this is why word of mouth recommendation or warning from friends may be useful. Some organisations which provide complementary and alternative therapies ensure that those therapists have professional indemnity insurance. Although claims against practitioners for malpractice are very rare, it is worth remembering that such insurance is also intended to cover a practitioner against accidents on their premises. You should also check whether the practitioner is insured to treat HIV-positive people. A number of companies which provide professional indemnity insurance to complementary and alternative practitioners will not cover practitioners who treat HIV-positive people. Organisations providing complementary therapies such as the Immune Development Trust also provide training and professional support to practitioners, and ensure that practitioners abide by a code of conduct. If you have been referred to a therapist through such an organisation, ask to see details of the code of conduct so that you know where you stand if you have any doubts or complaints in the future. 90 GETTING TREATMENT [Page 91](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/97?q1=directories) Clinical trials Introduction to clinical trials The purpose of clinical trials Almost every month we hear of a new drug or some other treatment for HIV infection on television or in newspapers. 'Treatment breakthroughs' reported in the media are often exaggerated and premature. Any new treatment, no matter how promising it appears to be in laboratory tests, has to go through a careful process of clinical trials in people before its usefulness can really be known. A clinical trial is a research study used to assess the benefits and risks of a new treatment. Following basic laboratory research on a new drug, trials are the next step in working out which treatments are most likely to be effective for future patients, and what unintended side-effects they may have. They may also reveal what interactions there are between different drugs. In medical practice, only a very few treatments are so powerful that their value is obvious without a clinical trial. The effects of most therapies are much less dramatic and need to be tested in a clinical trial. Not every trial will find a drug that works, but finding out which drugs do not work or are actually harmful, or when side effects outweigh the benefits, is also important. Some clinical trials are designed to find out more information about how best to use existing treatments; for example the right dose for a drug, the best time to start taking it, or the best drugs to combine together. Clinical trials begin only after preliminary studies in the laboratory and with animals have shown that it is safe enough to be taken by people. Clinical trials in people are usually conducted in three steps or phases: Phasel Phase I trials test the treatment in only a few people (usually healthy volunteers) to learn whether it is safe to take, and to find the maximum safe dose. Phase II Phase II trials test the treatment in a few hundred people to find the most effective dose. Extended Phase II studies may also assess if it is active against the disease in the short term. If the treatment is not active, no more trials will take place. CLINICAL TRIALS 91 [Page 92](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/98?q1=directories) Phase III Phase III trials test the treatment on several hundred to several thousand people, often at many different clinics or hospitals. Usually the drug is given in a dose that has been found to be safe enough for most people in Phase I or II trials, and is thought to be effective against the disease. These trials usually compare the new treatment either with a treatment already in use or, occasionally, with an inactive lookalike pill called a placebo, or two or more different doses of the test drug are compared. Clinical trials in HIV infection There is still no drug that has been shown to cure HIV infection or restore a severely damaged immune system. At present there are only a few approved treatments for HIV and the many opportunistic infections to which people with HIV may be vulnerable. Clinical trials are therefore particularly important in this rapidly developing area of medicine. Clinical trials for people with HIV are currently testing treatments in four broad categories, and at both early and late stages of HIV disease. Some new trials are testing combinations of the approaches described below. 1 Treatments intended to fight HIV at different stages of its lifecycle in order to stop or delay it damaging the immune system. The only approved antiretroviral drug of this kind is AZT (also known as zidovudine or Retrovir). ddl (didanosine or Videx) and ddC (zalcitabine or Hivid) are also widely available, although they are not formally licensed in this country. Other experimental drugs in this category which are being tested in trials in the UK include TIBOL, 3TC and stavudine (d4T). 2 Treatments intended to improve the immune system (immunomodulators). There is no licensed treatment of this kind. Trials in the UK are testing a treatment called passive immunotherapy and the therapeutic vaccines gpl 60 and p24.VLP. 3 Treatments for the various HIV-related opportunistic infections. There are licensed drugs to treat many of the infections to which people with HIV may be vulnerable, including bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. Researchers are looking for and testing more and better drugs, as well as drugs for infections which cannot be treated effectively at present. Current trials include albendazole for cryptosporidiosis, and combinations of drugs to treat MAI. 4 Preventative treatments (prophylaxis) to prevent or delay opportunistic infections from occurring in the first place. Co-trimoxazole (Septrin) and aerosolised pentamidine have been shown to be effective in preventing PCP. In the UK trials are looking for the best prophylactic drugs to prevent fungal and viral infections. Joining clinical trials Pros and cons People who loin trials usually do so for several reasons: * to get access to new and possibly helpful treatments before they are widely available * to get the best possible medical care with frequent check-ups * because standard treatments have failed or have caused severe side effects * to help in the search for effective treatments, and contribute to scientific knowledge for the benefit of all people with HIV Some people with HIV don't join trials because: * they may not wish to take drugs whose benefits and side-effects have not been established * they may not be eligible to join the trials that are available locally * they are unaware what trials are available * they may not be using conventional medicine at all * they may not want to start taking medicines if they feel perfectly healthy * they may not fully understand what is involved Inclusion and exclusion Each clinical trial has its own rules about who can and who cannot take part. These are known as inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria spell out the characteristics which will allow a person into the study. This is to make sure that the people in the trial are similar enough so that reliable comparisons can be made between the effects of the treatments used in the different groups. For example, a particular trial might be intended to test the effect of a drug for people who are at a particular stage of HIV disease. So a typical inclusion criterion might state that participants in a trial have to have a CD4 (T-cell) count between, say, 200 and 350. As another example, trial participants must be able to get to the trial centre at set intervals of time. The exclusion criteria are intended to protect the trial participants. For example, you may be excluded from a trial if there is a risk of a dangerous interaction between the trial drug and other treatments which you use. A common exclusion criterion forbids trial participants from taking other drugs at the same time which are similar to the one being studied; thus, people in a trial of an antifungal drug will not be allowed to take other antifungal drugs while they are in the trial. Trials sometimes exclude whole groups of people. This is not necessarily for bad reasons. Most trials exclude pregnant women, because of a fear that the treatment might harm the unborn baby. The laws protecting the foetus are substantial. Most trials insist that women are using contraception. Others exclude injecting drug users, 92 CLINICAL TRIALS [Page 93](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/99?q1=directories) because some researchers fear that they may not be reliable trial participants. These attitudes are starting to change as doctors realise that everyone should be given the opportunity to take part in trials. It is important to know whether drugs are also safe and effective for women and drug users, as well as everyone else; this need has to be balanced against the researchers' legal and ethical obligation to ensure that the foetus is safe. The right time to join a trial There is no right or wrong time to join a trial. People join trials at different times and for different reasons. Some people are not able to join trials because of particular inclusion and exclusion criteria. Some people choose never to join a trial, and there is nothing wrong with saying no. It is something that is best decided in close consultation with your doctor or nurse. If you are ill and a doctor recommends an experimental drug as the best chance of treatment or offers a new drug as part of a comparative trial, you may have to decide whether or not to take part in the trial at quite short notice. But otherwise, it is worth taking plenty of time to think carefully about your treatment options before deciding whether joining a trial is the best option for you. How to join a particular trial If you hear of or read about a trial that interests you, the first step is to talk to the contact person listed in the A-Z of clinical trials in this directeory. It does not necessarily matter if you are currently receiving treatment at a different clinic, although you should be sure to tell your regular doctor if you do join a trial at a different centre. The staff at the trial site will usually ask you some questions over the phone to check that you meet the basic entry requirements for the trial. If you do, they will make an appointment for you to visit the trial centre. During that appointment you may be asked more detailed questions about your health, and you may have a physical examination and a blood test. After the results of all the tests are available, the trial site staff will let you know whether or not you are eligible to take part. During a trial During a clinical trial you have to follow a timetable of treatment, check-ups and blood tests, to see if the treatment is working. The researchers will keep a careful record of your progress. You may have to go to the clinic for check-ups as rarely as once every six months or as often as five times a week; in some trials these check-ups may be included in your usual appointments. Usually you can take the trial drug at home, but some trials require you to stay in hospital. You may have to make some changes to your everyday life, such as avoiding certain foods or over-the-counter medicines like aspirin because they might interfere with the trial drug's action, or taking the treatment before or after meals. You may also be asked to keep a list of any side-effects you notice from the treatment, or a record of your daily activities, or what you eat. How trials are organised The preparation for a trial The plan for a trial is usually called a protocol. It lays down guidelines for how the treatment will be given, who is eligible to take part, the timetable for tests and visits for participants, the length of the study, how the results be assessed and so on. The protocol is written by a group of doctors or other researchers or by a pharmaceutical company. First, the trial planners will examine previous research on a particular experimental treatment. They then work out the next questions that need to be asked, and design a new trial to try to find out the answers. Before a study can begin, the ethics committee at each trial centre must approve the protocol. The membership of the ethics committee varies from hospital to hospital, but usually includes doctors, nurses, at least one lay person and often a lawyer or chaplain. They are responsible for protecting the rights and interests of the people in the trial, and work independently of those running or financing the trial. It is very important that any clinical trial should be run with the approval of an ethics committee. Such an approval is a good indication that a trial is reputable, even though the committee does not usually monitor the actual running of the trial. CLINICAL TRIALS 93 [Page 94](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/100?q1=directories) Recruiting participants The next step is to recruit participants and start the trial. The more quickly participants are recruited to the trial the sooner it can be completed and the treatment's benefits and harms assessed. Since the difference between the effect of a new drug and another treatment could be small, the drug may have to be tested in a large number of people to get a clear picture of whether it is better or worse than other treatments that are currently available. Thus, a clinical trial should be seen as a partnership between researchers and people with HIV. Researchers need people to join their trials so that they can improve medical knowledge about HIV infection. People with HIV may want to help this research, but will also want to make sure that their individual interests will be looked after in the trial. Researchers want people to join their trials because they share the researchers' uncertainties about which of the options being tested in the trial is the best, rather than because they are already convinced that they want one of the trial options. This is known as the 'uncertainty principle'. Informed consent Informed consent means that before you can join a trial, the researchers must first explain the study to you and obtain your agreement to take part. The researchers must explain a number of important things about the trial, such as its purpose, the treatment that will be tested, the number of clinic visits, possible benefits and harms, and so on. Informed consent takes place after all of the important facts about the trial have been explained, when you say that you understand these facts and you agree to enter the trial. In the case of children, a parent or guardian has to agree for them to take part in a trial, although older children should also agree themselves. It is just as important that you take time to consider whether the trial is in the best interests of your child. You will usually be asked to sign a consent form, to show that you understand what has been explained to you. It is meant to show that you have made your decision not only of your own free will, but also in full possession of the facts. You are fully entitled to change your mind after you have signed this form. The form of the trial In most studies, the decision about whether a person joins the group of people who receive the experimental drug or the group who receive the control (the standard treatment or the placebo) is made in a random fashion. Randomisation This is the best way to make sure that these groups are as similar as possible, so that the only difference between them is in the treatment they receive. This means that more accurate comparisons can be made without any bias. Randomisation is ethical if researchers do not know or cannot agree which treatment will turn out to be better or safer. Randomisation also gives all participants an equal chance of receiving the better treatment. For example, in a trial comparing the effects of AZT in 50 people with the effects of ddl in 50 people, it is important to make sure that the people in the two groups are similar in terms of their stage of disease, age and so on. The only reliable way to do this is by randomisation. Placebo For some conditions there is no recognised standard treatment; for example, there is no consensus yet on the treatment of early and symptom-free HIV infection ('early intervention') or on the best treatment or prophylaxis for certain opportunistic infections. In these cases, clinical trials may compare an experimental drug to no treatment. Participants receiving no treatment may be given a neutral, inert, harmless substance called a placebo. People will not normally be given a placebo if there is any standard treatment available that might benefit them. For example, the Concorde trial tested whether AZT can delay or prevent the development of AIDS in symptom-free people with HIV and improve survival. Ethically, it was able to give half the participants no treatment (a placebo), because there is no established standard treatment for symptom-free people. Comparison trials The most common type of clinical trial is a comparison trial, in which one group of people who receive a new treatment is compared with another group of people who receive an existing or standard therapy. When there is a recognised standard treatment for a particular condition, then trials will be designed to compare an experimental drug with that standard treatment. In this case it would be unethical to give some trial participants no treatment rather than the standard treatment. For example, trials of a new prophylactic drug to prevent PCP from developing in people with low CD4 counts will usually compare the effectiveness of the new drug against co-trimoxazole (Septrin), which is the standard treatment. Other comparison trials may simply compare different doses of the same drug. For example, the Alpha trial compared a lower dose of ddl with a higher dose of ddl for people who were not benefiting from AZT. Or they might compare different drug combinations. For example, the Delta trial compares the effectiveness of the combination of AZT plus ddl, the combination of AZT plus ddC, and AZT alone. Blinding In some trials, neither the researchers nor the participants are supposed to know who is getting the drug and who is getting the standard treatment or no treatment. (They are all 'packaged' to look the same.) This is called double-blinding (because both researcher and participant are said to be 'blind' to who is receiving what). When only the participants do not know which treatments they are receiving, but the researchers do, then the clinical trial is known as single-blind. The purpose of blinding is to make sure that nobody's expectations affect the results of the trial. A doctor who 94 CLINICAL TRIALS [Page 95](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/101?q1=directories) knows which patients were getting a particular treatment might unconsciously assess or treat them in a different way; similarly, participants who know their treatment might describe their symptoms differently. The end of a trial In the protocol, the researchers usually give an estimate of how long the trial will last. While some trials last only a few weeks, others can go on for years. In many large trials, a special group of independent researchers and lay people, called a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, checks regularly on the results of the trial while it is taking place. If they find that one group of patients is doing much better than the other, they can recommend that the trial is stopped earlier than planned so that the better treatment can be offered to all the participants. They can also recommend that a trial should be stopped if one group of trial participants develops an unacceptably level of serious side-effects. Some trials collect information on the participants' health even after the trial has stopped. If the results are favourable, some trials will offer a supply of the drug to all participants in the study until it becomes available through other access programmes or is licensed for doctors to prescribe. The results of all trials are sent to the national drug licensing body - the Medicine Licensing Agency. If the Agency agrees that the new treatment is effective and safe it is licensed for marketing, and can then be used routinely in everyday medical practice. Practical questions about clinical trials The alternatives If you are planning to join a clinical trial as a way of obtaining a new therapy, make sure that you have thought carefully about all your options first. The drug First, are you sure that you want to take the drug in question? Check the information about it in the A-Z of treatments and also find out what your doctor can tell you about it. Be especially wary of newspaper reports of new treatments; they often exaggerate or distort information so that even the earliest laboratory test results are hyped into a 'treatment breakthrough'. Make sure that you are not missing out on effective approved treatment in order to take one whose benefits are unclear. Find out how the trial drug may compare to other available treatments. Check that there are good theoretical grounds or reliable earlier research to show why it is promising. The trial Next check that the trial offers you a reasonable chance of receiving the drug. The trial may have a control arm in which participants are given a standard treatment or a placebo rather than the experimental drug. In most controlled trials you will not be told whether or not you are receiving the control or the experimental drug. If your only reason for joining a trial is to receive the experimental drug, you would be better off looking for other ways to obtain it. Check whether the drug will be made available to you after the trial has ended. Some trial sponsors have not allowed study participants to continue to take the experimental therapy after the trial has ended, even if the drug has been shown to be effective. Alternatively, however, some sponsors will allow you to continue to take the drug if it appeared to be helpful for you, even if the trial as a whole showed the drug to be a failure. Compassionate use Joining a clinical trial may not be the only way in which you can obtain an experimental drug. Some experimental drugs are made available to doctors before trials have been completed through a special arrangement called \"named patient basis prescribing\". The A-Z of treatments describes which drugs are available on a named patient basis in the UK. Because this information is not widely publicised, your doctor may not know what drugs are available on a named patient basis without checking. Buyers' clubs When experimental drugs cannot be obtained through official channels such as these, some people with HIV have decided to take matters into their own hands and import drugs for their own use from non-profit 'buyers clubs' in Europe or the USA. Again, it is important to get as much information as possible about the benefits and risks of such drugs, and to inform your doctor of your plans, so that he or she can provide proper medical monitoring. In some cases, buyers' clubs will only sell drugs to people who have proof that their doctor approves of and will supervise their use of the drug. CLINICAL TRIALS 95 [Page 96](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/102?q1=directories) Possible problems Side-effects Like any medical therapy, the treatments tested in clinical trials carry some risks. Before a clinical trial begins, the new treatment has already been through many laboratory tests to find out what side-effects it may cause. The researchers may know about some of the side-effects from these tests, but more side-effects may show up during the trial. Some may be mild, such as nausea or tiredness, and usually go away on their own or after treatment is stopped. Other toxicities can be more serious, like kidney or liver damage or pancreatitis. Remember that some side-effects only appear after long-term use of a drug, rather than straight away, and that even after you have stopped taking the drug there is always a risk that some side-effects may be permanent. Unproven therapy Until clinical trials are held, no-one knows whether the new treatment being tested will prove better than treatments already available. There is always a chance that the new treatment will turn out to be ineffective or do more harm than good. There is also the chance that the treatment may be helpful for a short time but not contribute to your health in the long run. Inconvenience Trial participants may have to make frequent visits to the clinic for check-ups on their progress, and for laboratory tests. This may involve lengthy or inconvenient travelling, which may be particularly difficult if you have children - or it is your child who is taking part in the trial. Most tests just require drawing of blood, but some may be more complicated and time-consuming. Being reminded of HIV Some people find that taking part in medical research is a disturbing reminder of their HIV infection, especially if they have no HIV-related symptoms and/or the trial drug causes side effects. Possible benefits Early access to a new treatment Participants in clinical trials are among the first to receive new treatments before they become widely available. Some people will consider that present treatments are ineffective or too toxic and will therefore prefer to try a new treatment that may offer more hope and fewer side-effects. While it is possible that the new treatment may turn out to be disappointing, the researchers usually have good reason to believe that it may be more effective or have fewer side-effects than the current treatment. A sense of control Some people with HIV find that starting treatment or using a different, new or experimental drug gives them a sense that they are actively fighting back against the virus, rather than quietly 'sitting by'. Helping future people with HIV For some people with HIV, taking part in a trial lets them make a real contribution to medical knowledge by helping researchers learn whether a new treatment will be helpful for themselves and other people with HIV in the future. Specialised care Many people with HIV choose to take part in clinical trials because of the very thorough monitoring and care which they receive while in the trial. Regardless of the effectiveness of the trial drug itself, many people feel that the advantage of regular physical check-ups and laboratory tests such as CD4 (T-cell) counts makes it worthwhile joining a suitable trial. Questions to ask During a trial, participants have to follow the rules about taking the treatment and being monitored, as outlined in the trial protocol. Every trial has different rules, so it is important to learn exactly what a trial requires before you agree to take part. Everything you have to do while you are in the trial should be carefully explained to you. Most of these questions should be answered when the researcher first tells you about the study. Questions about the trial design Will I know what treatment I am receiving? In blinded trials, you are not told whether you are taking the trial drug or the control (a placebo or a standard treatment). What are my chances of receiving the trial drug? For some people, getting access to an experimental drug is their main reason for joining the trial. What happens if my condition worsens? Many trials require you to stop taking part if your condition worsens beyond a pre-defined point e.g. if your CD4 count falls to, say, half of its level on entering the trial. Some trials guarantee that people who have been receiving a placebo will be switched over to receive the genuine trial drug if their condition deteriorates. Check what the procedure would be in your study. Will I be informed of the trial's results when it ends? Sadly, many researchers have not been good at communicating trial results to the people who took part. Many people may find it unacceptable that they are not informed of the practical outcome of their time in the trial, or only stumble across the results by chance in (often distorted) newspaper accounts. Ask how the researchers will ensure that you are told the trial results. If for any reason you don't approve of the trial design, it is important to tell the researchers. For instance, if you believe that joining the trial is the only way of getting an experimental treatment, you may decide that your interests are best served by joining the trial even though you are unable or unwilling to comply too closely with the rules. However, the researchers may be able to suggest other options if you are frank with them, and your comments may help to make sure that future trials are designed in a way which balances the needs of the researchers and the needs of people with HIV. 96 CLINICAL TRIALS [Page 97](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/103?q1=directories) Questions about the drug What are the standard treatments for my disease? From what is already known, how does the experimental treatment compare with established treatments? What are the possible harms and benefits of the treatment? This should include an explanation of the reasons why it is believed that the trial treatment may be helpful, as well as the possible disadvantages and/or side-effects. How will my options be affected in the future? If you are taking part in an early trial of a promising drug, you may be concerned that your participation could disqualify you from taking part in larger trials in the future. For example, you might become resistant to the drug, or even to other related drugs too. Check this with the researchers. You may also be able to find out ways in which you can be kept informed about the results of future trials using this drug. How is the drug taken, when, and how often? It may be taken by mouth (as a tablet or in a liquid solution); as a cream, lotion or spray; or by injection, infusion or 'drip'. If it is by injection or infusion, you may have to attend the clinic regularly to have the treatment administered to you, or else learn to inject yourself at home. Some drugs have to be taken at the same time as food, while others should be taken on an empty stomach. If it has to be taken at frequent and regular intervals, will this disrupt your daily routine or even your sleep during the night? What help with side effects is available? Find out what will be done to relieve any anticipated side effects you may experience. What help will there be for so-called 'mild' symptoms? What should I do if I get sudden or unexpected side effects? Find out how you will be monitored to check for harmful reactions. It is also wise to check what arrangements have been made in case you need medical help outside normal clinic hours. Questions about the effect on everyday life What additional tests will be required because of the trial? There are likely to be several medical checkups to see whether the drug is working and to detect any harmful effects. In some trials these may be necessary several times a week, but only every few months in others. Sometimes trial monitoring can simply be done as part of your regular check-ups. Some forms of monitoring may involve special procedures such as a lumbar puncture or an endoscopy. How long is the trial expected to last and when will it start? It is worth knowing the length of the commitment you are making. Remember, however, that you can withdraw from a trial at any time without affecting the standard of medical care you receive. Will I have to spend time in hospital? If so, for how long? How often must I visit the trial centre? If you live or work some way from the trial centre, the expense and inconvenience of travel may be a consideration. Do I have to do any special activities while I'm at home? Do I have to write them down? There may be other things that you are asked to do, such as writing down information at home about your daily activities, or avoiding certain foods. How else might the trial disrupt my daily life? Check how taking part in the trial might affect your social or family life. This is an important consideration for all people in relationships, and especially for parents with small children. Questions about restrictions In the early days of clinical trials for HIV/AIDS, some studies restricted the use of other treatments and prophylaxis for unrelated opportunistic infections. Fortunately these restrictions are now rare, as researchers recognise the importance of finding out the benefits and side-effects of new treatments in the 'real world'. Are there any foods or drugs that I shouldn't use while I'm in the trial? Some trials may require you to avoid drinking alcohol or eating certain foods, or even over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, in case they interfere with the trial drug. Or you may have to take certain drugs either at meal times or on an empty stomach. And you may also have to avoid taking certain drugs at the same time. Can I use other drugs during the trial? If you are taking other approved or experimental treatments for HIV/AIDS or other medical conditions, you may not be eligible for the trial. Alternatively, you may have to decide which treatment is the most important to you. Ethical trials should allow participants to receive the current standard of care, such as taking prophylaxis against PCP if your CD4 count is below 200. Are there any restrictions relating to birth control and pregnancy? Many trials require women of child-bearing potential to be using contraception. However, some may not allow the use of the contraceptive pill. Find out what sort of contraception is allowed or required. Most trials exclude pregnant women. Find out what you would have to do if you thought that you had become pregnant while in the trial. Are there any restrictions relating to drug use? Unfortunately many trials exclude people who are current injecting drug users, and some also exclude people who used to inject drugs or who now take methadone maintenance for their drug use. Confidentiality and ethical considerations Can I be sure that my confidentiality will be fully protected? Find out how your medical records will be kept and who has access to them. Will your GP be told that you are taking part in the trial? Have the system for protecting your confidentiality explained to you. Has this trial been approved by a local Ethics Committee? Most reputable trial centres have their own independent committee to check that research studies are appropriate. The vast majority of doctors are trustworthy and reliable. However, occasionally a researcher has tried to persuade people to take experimental treatments which have not been properly scrutinised. If an ethics committee has not approved the trial in which you are interested, you should CLINICAL TRIALS 97 [Page 98](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/104?q1=directories) definitely seek further independent advice before joining it, by contacting your local Body Positive group or AIDS service organisation or talking to your regular doctor. Financial questions Do I have to pay for the treatment? Be very wary indeed about trials in which you are expected to pay for a drug. It may prove to be ineffective or even harmful. In many cases in which researchers have charged money for an experimental treatment, they have turned out to be more interested in their profits than in their patients' health. Will my expenses be paid? In some trials your travelling costs, any additional child-care costs and other expenses may be refunded; check whether this is the case. Alternatively, you may be able to find a trial site closer to where you live or work. What compensation arrangements are there? It is rare for trials in HIV to offer compensation. However, it is worth checking whether there is any agreed procedure for getting compensation in the event of unforeseen harmful effects. Questions about leaving the trial Why might I have to withdraw from the trial? You should be told the possible reasons why you might have to leave the study e.g. if you develop an opportunistic infection or if your CD4 count falls by a certain amount during the trial. What if the drug has no effect on most of the people taking it, but seems to work for me? Find out if you will be able to carry on getting the drug. Often a trial drug is only made available to former trial participants if it was shown to be safe and effective in the trial. What will happen if I get worse while taking a placebo? Some trials are designed so that you would be guaranteed to be given the trial drug if you deteriorate while on placebo. How can I find out the results of the trial? Check that the researchers will let you know the findings of the study after it has finished. Thinking it over Do not rush into a decision about joining a trial. Take time to consider all your options and all the pros and cons. Make sure that you have had time to consider how the trial might affect you. Make sure you have had a chance to discuss all you questions or concerns with the doctor. It is sensible to adopt a sceptical attitude if you are ever told that a clinical trial has no possible drawbacks or hazards: this is rarely true of any treatment. After all, if we knew that a drug were completely safe and effective, there would not be any need for the trial. There should be written information provided which you can take away and read at leisure. If a trial is already underway, ask if it is possible to meet or talk to someone who has already taken the drug. There is nothing wrong in saying 'no' or asking for more time to think about it. It may be helpful to think how you reached a decision on an important or complicated question in the past. Perhaps you could talk through the issues with a friend, who may help you to clarify your own views. Or you might find it useful to talk to someone on a telephone helpline; some numbers are given at the end of this booklet. Rights and responsibilities If you join a trial, you have certain responsibilities to the trial researchers. The researchers should also respect certain rights that you have. Your rights when you join a trial First and foremost, no-one should force you or pressure you into entering a trial. It is a choice that you alone can make after you have received and understood all the facts about the study. You have the right to get understandable answers to any questions that you may have before you agree to enrol. Once you have entered the trial you have the right to withdraw from it at any time without this affecting the regular medical care you receive. You do not have to give any reason. Feel free to ask about the results of any tests that you have to take during the trial. You will probably want to keep track of your progress in the trial to help you decide whether to continue in the trial or not. But bear in mind that many trials are double-blinded, meaning that neither you nor your doctor knows which arm of the trial you are in. So even your doctor may not be told the results of some of the tests performed upon you. Finally, you should always be able to contact someone out of clinic hours with any important concerns or urgent questions you may have about the treatment, its side-effects or any other symptoms. The responsibilities of joining a trial The researchers have set up the trial to answer specific questions. Nobody gains if the trial is unable to answer those questions. So it is important that you follow the rules of the trial as far as possible, and tell your doctor if you cannot follow any of them. For example, if you find it difficult or forget to take trial tablets, it is best to let the researchers know so that they can interpret the trial results properly. Even though all the tests and restrictions might seem like a lot of trouble, they are designed to protect you against unknown side-effects, and to get reliable information about the treatment. Making an effort to follow the rules of the trial can help everyone. It may be helpful to ask the researchers to spell out your responsibilities at the start of the trial. For example, you may find that you have to miss a clinic visit, or you might forget to take the trial drug. Check whether these may affect your rights to continue in the trial. For safety reasons, it is worth taking some time to tell the researchers about any relevant aspects of your medical 98 CLINICAL TRIALS [Page 99](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/105?q1=directories) history, such as previous drug allergies or any other treatments you are currently taking. You may also be asked if you taking any recreational drugs. It is important to tell the researchers about any new symptoms you may experience, even such things as rashes and headaches. These may seem unimportant at the time, or you may suspect that you are on a placebo and that therefore these are not side effects of the drug. However, you may be wrong. It is your responsibility to tell researchers in order to give them the maximum information with which to judge the harms and benefits of the treatment. The best protection against serious side-effects during a clinical trial is to learn about the symptoms of possible side-effects and promptly notify the investigators whenever there is a change in your health - even if it is only a headache or rash. Deciding not to join a trial If you decide not to enter the trial, or if you decide to leave the trial after it begins, you still have the right to the same medical care that any other person receives. Remember that you are not necessarily saying 'no' to all clinical trials. make sure that keep up-to-date about other options and new trials. Leaving a trial You and your doctor might decide that you stop a trial treatment if your condition is getting worse and the therapy is not helping you. Do not feel bad about leaving trials because of side effects. You can also decide to leave a trial at any time, and for any reason, without this affecting the regular medical care you receive. All that you might lose is any extra check-ups that came with the trial. The researchers will usually want to continue to follow your progress after the trial, even if you left it early. This helps them to interpret the results of the trial accurately. CLINICAL TRIALS 99 [Page 100](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/106?q1=directories) A to z of Treatments m 1592U89 935U83 is also known by its chemical name 23-dideoxy-3-fluoro-5-chlorouridine, or by the abbreviation FCU. 1592U89 is a new nucleoside analogue anti-HIV drug that entered Phase I studies in late 1994. It is synergistic with AZT in the test-tube and has a similar ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. No significant side-effects have been seen in animals given doses five to ten times higher than those proposed for testing in humans. It is also active in vitro against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Tests suggest that HIV will be able to develop resistance to 1592U89 at a similar rate to AZT and that virus that is resistant to 1592U89 will also be cross-resistant to ddl. 1592U89 is being developed by Wellcome. S935U83 935U83 is the codename for a new anti-HIV drug being developed by the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. It is a nucleoside analogue - the family of drugs to which AZT, ddl and ddC also belong. These drugs act by inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme. Current use 935U83 is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Tests in animals found that side-effects only occurred at doses 90 times higher than those needed to inhibit HIV in the test-tube. Laboratory tests are reported to have indicated that bone marrow suppression is likely to be less common than that seen at the 500 mg dose of AZT. These side-effects included anaemia and liver toxicity. Initial small safety studies using standard doses in humans showed no side-effects. 935U83 is active against both HIV-1 and HIV-2, as well as HIV strains that have developed resistance against AZT, ddl, ddC or lamivudine. Early phase 1/11 trials are underway testing 935U83 in combination with ddl; the combination is synergistic in the test-tube. 935U83 is not currently available in Britain. Key research Van Aerschot evaluated the anti-HIV activity of 935U83 in vitro. 935U83 inhibited the cytopathic effects of HIV-1 in MT-4 cells at a concentration of 0.38 pM. The compound was cytotoxic at a concentration of 535 pM. Balzarini reported that 935U83 is active against HIV-2 replication in vitro, and has no effect on syncytia formation. Parry and Daluge each demonstrated that 935U83 is active against mutant viruses that are resistant to AZT, ddl, lamivudine and ddC. 100 a multi-centre dose-escalating pharmacokinetics and safety study. No adverse effects to single doses of 935U83 (up to 1600 mg) were noted. A high fat meal prior to dosing decreased the rate of absorption but did not affect oral bioavailability.

These drugs act by inhibiting HIV's protease enzyme. Protease (or proteinase) is the name of the enzyme that HIV uses when it replicates within a cell to break up large viral proteins into smaller ones from which new virus particles can be made. Protease inhibitors have been shown to slow down the replication of HIV in the test-tube. Because HIV protease is only created by infected cells and has no normal function in the body, drugs that act specifically against it are unlikely to harm normal cells. A-74704, A-77003 and A-80987 are manufactured by Abbott. Current use None of these drugs is currently being pursued. A-74704 was an early compound tested by Abbott which never made it into human studies. A-77003, a compound which was active against HIV at lower concentrations, was tested in a phase I study which found no evidence of antiviral effects. The drug was metabolised so quickly that it had to be given by continuous intravenous infusion. A-80987 was better absorbed, but had poor antiviral activity and caused liver toxicities in a phase I study in France and the Netherlands. Key research Danner reported that in a Phase I trial of A-77003 as a 24-hour infusion, the drug was very rapidly cleared from the body, such that the half-life was immeasurable. No clear antiviral effects could be detected. Robins reported the isolation of HIV-1 mutations that are 5-10 fold resistant to A-77003 and A-80987 in vitro. Both resistant mutants shared substitutions at codons 32 and 46, of which 32 was identified as the primary mutation responsible for resistance. References Danner SA et al.

It is also known as ABT-538. * ABV / ABVD ABV is a combination of Adriamycin (doxorubicin), bleomycin and vincristine. ABVD is ABV with the addition of dacarbazine. It is being studied as a treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and lymphoma. The side-effects of this regime may be reduced by the use of the growth factors GM-CSF or G-CSF. * Acyclovir Acyclovir is a licensed drug for treating herpes simplex and herpes zoster. It is manufactured by the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. It is sometimes referred to by the abbreviation ACV or by the tradename Zovirax. Current use Acyclovir is the standard therapy for herpes simplex. High doses are usually effective for treating hairy leukoplakia. There is some evidence that acyclovir, either on its own or in conjunction with AZT, may slow down the progression of HIV disease and/or improve survival, especially for people with low CD4 counts. There are several different theories that may explain this. First, although acyclovir has no direct anti-HIV effects itself, it has been suggested that it may increase the anti-HIV effect of AZT. Secondly, acyclovir helps to suppress members of the herpes family of viruses, which may act as co-factors in activating HIV. Stopping or reducing the co-factor effect may therefore delay the progress of HIV disease. Thirdly, the established value of acyclovir in treating herpes viruses infections may in itself enhance the health of people with HIV. Very few side-effects have been reported from acyclovir. However, it can rarely cause rashes, gastro-intestinal upsets, headache, confusion, fatigue and abnormalities in some blood and liver tests. Intravenous infusions can cause severe inflammation or ulceration at the injection site and neurological problems such as confusion, hallucinations, agitation, convulsions and coma. The combination of AZT with intravenous acyclovir has been reported to cause extreme lethargy. Strains of herpes simplex and zoster that have developed resistance to acyclovir have been reported in immunosuppressed people. Taking it Acyclovir comes in several different formulations. Tablets are usually used, although an intravenous form is sometimes used for treating serious herpes attacks. Acyclovir cream is licensed for treating or preventing cold sores (herpes simplex blisters on the lips). The cream should A-Z OF TREATMENTS 101 [Page 102](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/108?q1=directories) not be used for treating herpes elsewhere in the body. A different ointment formulation is available for treating herpes simplex infections of the eye. Getting it Acyclovir tablets are available on prescription; intravenous acyclovir is used within hospital settings only. Acyclovir cream for cold sores can now be bought over the counter at chemists. Current developments A definitive study designed to test whether acyclovir can prevent disease caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), which is also a member of the herpes virus family, and to establish acyclovir's effects on disease progression and survival is ongoing in London, Australia and the USA. In the United States this trial is known by the code ACTG 204. Most of the studies to date have used very high (and very expensive) doses of acyclovir, but this study is looking at the effects of a range of doses. It is also testing valaciclovir, a compound which breaks down into acyclovir in the body, producing higher blood levels of acyclovir than can be achieved using standard acyclovir tablets. Key research Mitsuya and Broder reported that acyclovir and AZT synergistically inhibit HIV in vitro in the ATH8 cell line. However, Smith and Pagana later reported that at best only additive - and even antagonistic - effects were observed in the C3, Jurkat and CEM T-cell lines. Cooper (1991) enrolled 199 people with ARC in a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled European and Australian study of the combination of AZT and acyclovir versus AZT alone versus placebo. 67 participants received AZT (1000 mg/day) plus ACV (800 mg/day), 67 received AZT alone, and 65 received placebo for 6 months. Mean baseline CD4 counts in the three groups were 191, 166, and 230, respectively. Both AZT alone and the AZT/ACV combination increased CD4 counts and reduced the incidence of 01 compared with placebo. There was no difference between the combination of AZT/ACV and AZT alone. Survival was equivalent in the three groups. Cooper (1993) enrolled 265 people with AIDS/ARC (131 AIDS, 134 ARC - the same people with ARC that received active drug in the 6-month placebo-controlled study summarized above) in a multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled European and Australian study of the combination of AZT plus vs. AZT only. Patients received AZT (500 mg by mouth every 6 hours for one month, then 250 mg by mouth every 6 hours) either alone or in combination with ACV (800 mg every 6 hours) for 52 weeks. 46 (36%) AZT recipients and 37 (27%) combination recipients developed opportunistic infections. The probability of an ARC patient progressing to AIDS was 0.18 and 0.15 for the AZT alone and combination recipients, respectively. After excluding patients who experienced an opportunistic infection during the first 4 weeks of therapy, the probability was 0.13 and 0.099 for the AZT and combination recipients, respectively. Thirty-six participants treated with single-agent therapy (28 (41%) AIDS and eight (12%) ARC) and 15 combination recipients (13 (21%) AIDS and two (3%) ARC) died during the study. There was a significant difference in time to death between the combination and AZT alone groups for both AIDS and ARC patients, with combination patients surviving longer. Infections related to herpesviruses, but not cytomegalovirus, were reduced in patients receiving ACV therapy. CD4 cell counts in both arms generally increased initially and then declined. Forty-six per cent of patients in the AZT group (59% of AIDS and 31% of ARC patients) and 52% of patients in the combination group (69% of AIDS and 34% of ARC patients) experienced bone marrow suppression. Youle enrolled 302 CMV seropositive patients with advanced symptomatic HIV disease and CD4 counts below 150 (mean baseline CD4 count was 51 in the treated and 56 in the placebo group) in an international study of the efficacy of acyclovir in preventing CMV and other herpes virus diseases (study H14-325). Participants received oral acyclovir (800 mg four times daily) or placebo. The proportions of participants in each treatment group spending greater than 50%, 50-80% and 80-100% of their total time receiving an effective antiretroviral regimen were similar, namely 22 and 16% (placebo and acyclovir), 15 and 20%, and 63 and 64% respectively. At week 48 the study was stopped on the basis that statistically there was no evidence of a significant decrease in CMV disease occurring in the acyclovir group. At this time CMV disease had occurred in 16/123 patients in the acyclovir group and 9/123 in the placebo group. However, there was a statistically significant reduction in mortality in the high-dose acyclovir arm: 43/149 placebo recipients died (29%), the acyclovir group (18%). On an intention-to-treat analysis the overall probability of dying was 39% in the placebo group versus 23% in the acyclovir group; for those with CD4 counts below 50 the probability of dying was 56% vs 32%. Saag randomised 683 people with early ARC (CD4 counts between 200-800) to receive AZT (600 mg/day) plus acyclovir (800 mg every 4 hours) or AZT alone. After a mean follow-up of 490 days, no differences between the groups were seen in the primary endpoints of advanced ARC, AIDS or death. However, mean CD4 cell change from baseline peaked at week 12 for the AZT alone group (27% increase) and at week 24 for the combination group (52% increase); this rise above baseline was maintained for 47 weeks and 60 weeks respectively. Lavelle enrolled 677 people in a randomized trial comparing the combination of acyclovir (4.8 g/day) and AZT (600 mg/day) to AZT alone. All participants had one or two ARC symptoms and a CD4 count between 200 and 800 at baseline. At 24 weeks, CD4 counts had increased in both groups. However, CD4 increases were significantly greater in the ACV/AZT group. By 48 weeks, CD4 counts had fallen back to baseline in both groups and were not significantly higher in the ACV/AZT group. No differences in the rates of clinical progression, survival or adverse reactions were observed. Collier enrolled 67 people with ARC in an ACTG study of the combination. Patients received AZT (300, 600, 1500 mg per day) with or without ACV (800 mg every four hours) for 12-92 weeks. At study completion, no significant clinical or toxicity differences in treatment groups were seen at comparable doses. Patients receiving the combination had significantly higher MCVs than those receiving AZT alone. Although the combination of ACV and AZT was well tolerated, in vivo anti-retroviral synergy was not demonstrated. Stein retrospectively analysed the interactions of acyclovir and AZT among 786 participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) who started AZT treatment prior to developing AIDS. Any reported use of ACV was not associated with an effect on AIDS-free time but was associated with a 26% decrease in the risk of death. Use of ACV for an HIV indication was also not associated with an effect on progression to AIDS but was associated with a 36% decrease in the risk of AIDS. The median dose of ACV was 600-800 mg; there was no apparent dose effect on survival. Longer uninterrupted use of ACV after an AIDS diagnosis was associated with longer survival. Salvato analysed the CD4 counts and survival of 100 HIV-positive people treated between November 1990 and January 1992. 41 were on AZT alone (mean CD4 count was 234) and 40 were on AZT/ACV (mean CD4 count was 252). On univariant analysis with medication type as the independent variable, disease progression was significantly related to medication type. Patients on AZT alone experienced an average CD4 decrease of 60% while combination recipients experienced an average CD4 decrease of 34%. 48% of those on AZT alone survived while 88% on both AZT and ACV survived. Lifson treated 20 asymptomatic HIV-positive men with AZT and acyclovir in an open-label pilot study. Participants received 500 mg AZT plus either 2000 mg or 4000 mg ACV daily. One 2000 mg recipient required dose reduction because of myalgias; dose reductions were required for five 4000 mg recipients (nausea, anorexia, myalgia, anaemia and neutropenia) and four withdrew because of symptoms such as nausea, malaise and fatigue. Nguyen enrolled 21 people (4 AIDS, 14 ARC, 3 asymptomatic with CD4 less than 20) in an open-label pilot study of one-week alternations of AZT plus ACV, then ddl and then ddC. The median CD4 count at entry was 181. After 21 to 52 weeks, the regime was well tolerated: 2 participants developed mild neuropathy, and none had pancreatitis. AZT-induced nausea, malaise, and vomiting occurred in one-third of participants. The mean CD4 count was sustained above baseline through 40 weeks (maximum mean increase 64 cells at 8 weeks) and dropped below baseline at 48 weeks. References Collier AC et al.

AL-721 AL-721 is a lipid mixture extracted from hen egg yolks by a special process. In the mid-to-late 1980s there were high hopes that it had significant anti-HIV effects. It was thought to act by removing cholesterol from the surface membranes of HIV particles and making them more fluid, thus making it impossible for them to bind to and infect human cells. AL-721 refers to the mixture of yolk ingredients in the substance: 7 parts neutral glycerides, 2 parts phospatidyl choline (lecithin) and 1 part phosphatidylethanolamine. It is manufactured by the Ethigen Corporation and marketed under the name Ovithin 120. Current use Early laboratory tests suggested AL-721 could reduce reverse transcriptase activity, and phase I and II studies suggested some improvements in the immune functions of HIV-positive people, although no effects on p24 antigenaemia or CD4 count were seen. Three clinical trials of AL-721 have been reported in full in the medical literature. One of these was inconclusive (Yust); the others (Grieco and Mildvan) found no benefits with the possible exception of weight gain, which may have been due to AL-721 s calorific value as a food. Small-scale studies also failed to establish any beneficial effects. In addition, some batches of AL-721 were contaminated with salmonella. AL-721 has also been shown to trigger allergy in some cases. Other side-effects seen in studies included diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea. Despite being a very popular 'underground' treatment in the 1980s, in the light of these studies interest in AL-721 has now all but disappeared. No trials are known to be underway anywhere in the world. Getting it Several lipid compounds very similar to AL-721 are available through health food shops. There is no evidence that these compounds have any beneficial effects. AL-721 can be prescribed on the NHS as a food supplement. Key research Yust treated 16 HIV-positive people (10 asymptomatic, 3 ARC, 3 AIDS) in an open trial of AL-721 (10 g/day in a fat-free breakfast for up to 16 months). 5/9 antigen-positive participants had a significant reduction in the serum level of HIV antigens following approximately 3 months AL-721 treatment, which remained suppressed throughout the trial period. In 2 of the other 4 antigen-positive people, combination of AZT and AL-721 resulted in a marked decrease in antigen levels. No consistent effect on T lymphocyte subpopulations was seen. Clinical parameters were not studied. Grieco evaluated the effects of AL-721 in an 8-week open trial in which 10 g twice daily was administered on a low fat diet to 8 HIV-infected men with lymphadenopathy. There appeared to be a detectable effect on reverse transcriptase level culture positivity during the 8-week period which may be suggestive of diminished HIV recoverability and reduction of viral load; however, this technique has not been standardised and is not a direct measure of viral load. Augmentation of mitogen-induced lymphoproliferative responses was suggested in 4/8 participants; however, there were no evident effects on CD4 counts or circulating serum p24 antigen values. Peters treated 14 HIV p24 antigenaemic people with AIDS or ARC in a study of AL-721 (15g twice daily for 12 weeks) or placebo in a study in which a change in p24 antigenaemia was the primary end-point, with secondary clinical end-points. There was no fall in p24 antigen concentrations and all had higher values at the end of their treatment period. All 6 treated AIDS patients had at least one major opportunistic infection during treatment, with a mean of 1.1 infections per 12 weeks. Mildvan enrolled 40 men with lymphadenopathy or ARC and CD4 counts above 200 in a multicentre dose-ranging study of oral AL-721, with an escalating dose schedule over 8 weeks. No patients progressed to AIDS during the study. There were no significant changes in weight associated with any dose tested. CD4 counts remained stable, and no statistically significant differences in counts were detected across dose groups. Levels of p24 antigen did not change consistently in the 3 patients with measurable antigen at entry. The study concludes that AL72 's lack of effect on surrogate markers does not support its use as an antiretroviral agent. References Grieco MH et al.

A-Z OF TREATMENTS 103 [Page 104](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/110?q1=directories) SAlpha interferon Alpha interferon is a natural protein produced by the human body in response to infection. It has some direct antiviral effects and also stimulates both the cellular and humoral arms of the immune system to fight them off. It is one of three classes of interferon (the others are beta interferon and gamma interferon) and there are at least 22 subtypes. The precise role of alpha interferon in HIV infection is unclear. Studies have shown that in the test-tube it can inhibit the virus. However, in people with HIV a rise in a particular kind of alpha interferon (called endogenous acid-labile alpha interferon) often coincides with the onset of symptoms. This has lead some researchers to speculate that the substance may actually be harmful. Genetic engineering techniques have allowed several companies to mass-produce alpha interferon, which is known as recombinant human alpha interferon, or by abbreviations such as rhlFN or rlFN-alpha. This is marketed under tradenames such as Intron A (made by Schering-Plough), Roferon-A (by Roche) and Wellferon (by Wellcome). Alpha interferon used to be known as lymphoblastoid interferon. Current use Studies have shown that intravenous alpha interferon can be helpful in treating Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), especially among people with higher CD4 counts. Research has suggested that people with more advanced disease develop resistance to alpha interferon, even if they have never received it as a treatment. This is thought to be due to the high levels of endogenous interferon which are often seen in advanced disease. It is also an approved treatment for genital warts and for viral hepatitis. Trials of alpha interferon as an anti-HIV treatment, either on its own or in combination with AZT, have produced inconsistent results. However, in several studies people receiving interferon have experienced a sharp drop in their CD4 count, lending weight to the view that interferon may actually contribute to the immune system damage seen in people with HIV. Injected interferon usually causes side-effects which resemble flu-like symptoms, such as shivering, muscle aches and feelings of fatigue. It can also lead to neutropenia - a shortage of neutrophils, immune cells that attack fungi and bacteria. Sometimes interferon can cause severe side-effects such as liver or bone marrow damage. In 1990 much publicity was given to claims that a type of alpha interferon absorbed in very low doses through the mouth (marketed as Kemron) greatly improved immune function, increased CD4 counts and in some cases caused HIV-positive people to become HIV-negative. No significant side-effects were reported. Much research has taken place to attempt to confirm or refute these findings and none of these studies have been able to find any benefit. The US National Institutes of Health has recommended that people with HIV do not use oral alpha interferon. Use in combinations The combination of alpha interferon plus AZT has been shown to be synergistic in the test-tube i.e. the effects of the combination are greater than would be expected simply by adding together the individual effects of each drug. However, these laboratory findings have not been borne out in humans. Virological tests such as p24 antigen levels do suggest that the combination may have slightly greater anti-viral effects compared with AZT alone, although this does not seem to result in improved CD4 counts and to date there is no evidence of clinical advantages such as fewer symptoms or better survival in people receiving the combination. There is some evidence that HIV strains that are resistant to AZT may be less likely to develop in people receiving the combination rather than AZT alone. The risk of side-effects from the drug combination also seems to be synergistic (i.e. greater than would be expected from simply adding together the toxicities seen with each individual drug). Careful monitoring for neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and liver problems is important. GM-CSF, a growth factor which stimulates the production granulocytes and macrophages, can help to relieve the neutropenia. Laboratory tests performed by Wellcome, manufacturers of AZT, suggest that the triple combination of AZT, ddC and alpha interferon works particularly well against both laboratory strains of HIV and 'wild' strains taken from people. At a relatively low concentration of AZT, the three-drug combination completely blocked HIV's ability to damage cells (its cytopathic effect). A multicentre trial of this combination is currently underway in the United States. Taking it Alpha interferon is usually given by intramuscular injection. These injections are not too painful and most people can manage to do them themselves at home. Getting it Alpha interferon is a licensed treatment for some forms of cancer, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. It can also used to treat chronic active hepatitis B and warts. It can be prescribed by doctors on the NHS. Current developments Research into the anti-HIV effects of alpha interferon, especially in combination with AZT, is still continuing. In December 1993 a US company called Advanced Biotherapy Concepts announced the results of a study in which 4 people with advanced AIDS had their blood plasma removed and passed through a device designed to remove endogenous alpha interferon using neutralising antibodies. The results indicated that the process is safe and effective; 2 participants experienced decreases in HIV levels and 2 also had reduced levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), another cytokine associated with disease progression. These findings add weight to the views of those who are sceptical about the value of treating people with HIV with interferon. Key research on alpha interferon monotherapy Poli reported that alpha interferon inhibited chronically infected cell lines. It suppressed the release of reverse transcriptase and viral antigens and the production or release (or both) of whole HIV virions, whereas AZT was only 104 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 105](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/111?q1=directories) active in acutely infected cells. Gendelman showed that alpha interteron inhibits viral replication in macrophages and T cells in vitro. Edlin (1992a) reported that, unlike AZT resistance, resistance to alpha interferon does not appear to be associated with duration of treatment with alpha interferon. Alpha interferon resistance appears to be related to disease state, with highest levels of resistance found in patients with AIDS, whether or not those patients had received any treatment with alpha interferon. The investigators suggested that this resistance results from high levels of endogenous alpha interferon which are correlated with advanced disease. Studies on the use of alpha interferon on patients with KS have shown remission rates between 35% (Rozenbaum) and 46% (Evans). Toxicities are dose related and include flu-like symptoms with marked fatigue. Less frequently, myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity occur. Chateauvert reported the results of the international ZIDON study comparing AZT monotherapy (500 mg/day) with the combination of AZT plus alpha interferon (3 million units 3 times a week subcutaneously). 402 participants with CD4 counts between 150 and 500 who had no prior experience of either drug were enrolled. Median follow-up was 47 weeks. The trial was stopped after the first 20 end-points had been reached, 11 in the combination group and 9 in the AZT monotherapy group, since the difference between the groups in the rate of progression was unlikely ever to be greater than or equal to the 50% reduction in end-points that the study was powered to detect. No major differences in CD4 count or percentage, p24 antigenaemia or the frequency of the codon 215 mutation associated with AZT resistance were observed. More adverse events, both haematological and subjective occurred in the combination arm. Lane (1990) enrolled 34 asymptomatic people with HIV with CD4 cell counts above 400 in a placebo-controlled trial of alpha interferon (35 million units subcutaneously once daily for 12-47 weeks). 7/17 IFN recipients withdrew for toxicity (flu-like symptoms) and the average daily tolerated dose was 17.5 million units/day. 7/17 IFN-treated participants and 2/17 placebo recipients became HIV culture-negative while on study. After 12 weeks of treatment, CD4 counts declined from baseline by an average of 4% for the IFN group and 25% for the placebo group. 32/34 patients were followed long-term (mean 24 months). 5/16 original placebo recipients and none of the IFN recipients developed an opportunistic infection in this period. de Wit evaluated the effectiveness and antiretroviral activities of interferon-alpha in AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in a non-randomised, phase-11 clinical trial. 28 participants were treated with high-dose (27-36 million units) human recombinant interferon-alpha 2a subcutaneously every day for 8 weeks. In participants with stable disease or showing a response, treatment was continued three times weekly until a complete response was achieved or there was progression. 12 of the 26 evaluable participants achieved a major response; 5 of these showed histologically confirmed complete responses. There was a significant increase in CD4 cells in the responders and a significant decrease in HIV antigen (HIV-Ag) in the 7 responders with initially detectable HIV-Ag. Brook reported 30-100% decreases in p24 antigen levels in 4/5 HIV-positive men treated with interferon-alpha (5-20 million units twice daily) for chronic hepatitis B coinfection. Key research on alpha interferon plus with AZT Hartshorn found that alpha interferon and AZT are synergistic against HIV in vitro. Lane (1992) enrolled 180 HIV-positive people with CD4 counts above 500 in a randomised trial comparing AZT (1200 mg/day) to the combination of AZT (600 mg/day) and alpha IFN (1 million units/day) or alpha IFN alone (5 million units). 107 patients are still active in the study after 16 months. 51 patients have withdrawn from the study after starting treatment. No clinical endpoints have been reached; of laboratory endpoints, no participants reached a CD4 count below 200, but 9 had a CD4 count decline of at least 20% (4 AZT plus 5 IFN). On AUC analysis total CD4 counts were significantly reduced in both IFN groups, but no significant changes in CD4 percents have been observed. Development of HIV isolates with reduced sensitivity to AZT is substantially less in the AZT plus IFN combination arm than the AZT monotherapy group. Conclusions about clinical efficacy cannot yet be reached. Clotet enrolled 1 12 people with symptomatic disease or CD4 counts below 300 in a randomized study comparing AZT alone (500 mg/day) to the combination of AZT (300 mg/day) and IFN-alpha (5 million units subcutaneously three times weekly). The treatment duration was six months. Preliminary data indicated no significant differences in CD4 percentages or clinical outcomes between the two groups. Kovacs treated 39 HIV-positive people with Kaposi's sarcoma with AZT (250, 100, or 50 mg orally every 4 hours); 6 weeks later interferon-alpha was begun at a dose of 5 million units/day and the dose was increased every 2 weeks until a maximum tolerated dose was determined. Participants then received the maximum tolerated dose of the combination for a minimum of 12 weeks. In the dose-escalation phase, the ability to tolerate interferon-alpha was clearly related to the AZT dose. Dose-limiting dysfunction (10%). Of the 22 participants who received a stable dose of both drugs for 12 weeks, 1 1 patients had a complete or partial tumour response and 8 showed an anti-HIV effect. Davey treated 24 people with CD4 counts of 200-500 with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with AZT plus escalating doses of daily subcutaneous interferon-alpha. Mean neutropenia- inducing doses of interferon-alpha were 9.4 x 106 and 10.6 x 10 international units/day for groups receiving 100 or 200 mg AZT every 4 hours, respectively. Serum p24 antigen declined greater than 70% in all 5 antigenaemic participants. Toxicities included a dose-dependent increase in lymphokine-like side-effects (100%), anorexia and weight loss (42%), fatigue (42%) and anaemia (50%). While toxicities of the combination can be significant, low-dose GM-CSF readily ameliorated neutropenia associated with AZT and interferon-alpha therapy without adversely affecting the antiviral properties of the combination. Berglund enrolled 18 patients with advanced HIV infection (mean CD4 count 139, range 3-350) and long-term prior AZT treatment (median 17 months) in a 3-month trial of AZT and native alpha IFN (3 million units/day subcutaneously). 5/18 patients withdrew before study completion due to side-effects or disease progression. Another 5/18 had their alpha IFN dose reduced before study completion. 8/18 completed the 3-month protocol. Reduced viral titres and p24 antigen levels were observed in 3/8 who completed the protocol. CD4 counts declined in most patients. Dose-limiting toxicities included fatigue and neutropenia. 35 early ARC patients with CD4 counts between 200-500 and p24 antigen levels greater than 70 pcg/ml are enrolled in a multicentre study (ACTG 068, Mildvan) evaluating the combination of low-dose alpha IFN (between 2 and 8 million units/day) and AZT (between 100 and 800 mg/day). 23/31 patients have completed more than 24 weeks on therapy. None has progressed to AIDS. Preliminary results suggest synergy with the combination of alpha IFN and AZT in terms of p24 antigen reduction, with a dose-response relationship favouring the higher combination levels. Carosi compared the use of AZT (250 mg twice daily) plus alpha interferon (3 million units three times a week) to AZT alone in 202 asymptomatic people with CD4 counts between 200-500. 4/16 participants in the combination arm who were p24-antigen positive became p24-negative, compared with 2/17 of those receiving AZT alone. 4 people receiving the combination progressed to AIDS compared with none in the AZT-alone arm. Minor opportunistic infections occurred more frequently in people in the AZT alone arm (6 versus 4). Neutropenia was more common in the combination group and anaemia more common in the AZT group. Krown treated 43 people with AIDS-associated KS with interferon-alpha (4.5, 9 or 18 million units/day) and AZT (600 or 1200 mg/day). Neutropenia was the major dose-limiting toxicity. Effects on CD4 count were related to both initial CD4 count and interferon dose. Frissen randomised 40 symptomatic HIV-positive people with CD4 above 150 to receive either AZT alone (250 mg four times a day) or AZT (250 mg twice a day) plus alpha interferon (3 x 106 units three times a week). At week 24 increase in CD4 count was significantly greater in the combination arm. Fatigue, malaise, anorexia and low-grade fever were observed more frequently in AZT plus IFN. Edlin (1992b) reported on an open-label dose-ranging pilot study in which 13 men with advanced HIV infection and p24 antigenaemia who had taken at least 6 weeks of AZT monotherapy added interferon alpha to their treatment. Plasma p24 antigen levels demonstrated a biphasic response, falling initially in 11 participants by a mean of 50% at a median of 11 weeks, but rising steadily thereafter. At higher interferon doses no greater reductions in p24 antigen occurred but side-effects were more severe and CD4 counts fell faster. PCR quantification of HIV DNA in 3 participants showed a biphasic pattern paralleling the p24 antigen response. With the exception of these short-term effects, the combination showed no evidence of lasting antiviral activiral activity beyond that achieved with AZT alone. Lafeuillade treated 10 symptomatic AIDS patients who experienced biological deterioration after at least 6 months AZT monotherapy with the addition of interferon alpha (3 million units every other day). After 6 months of combination treatment, CD4 counts stabilised in 6/10 and p24 levels decreased in 4/6 initially p24 antigen positive. Epstein found that recombinant interferon alpha (rlFNa) alone delayed, but did not suppress, virus production as measured by RT and p24 antigen assays on culture supernatants and had no significant effect on detection of RNA or DNA by quantitative PCR. In contrast, AZT or ddC alone or in combination with rlFNa gave greater than 95% inhibition of HIV-1 production at 3-4 days post infection using the RT and p24 assays. For AZT plus rlFNa, DNA synthesis was inhibited by 80%, while viral RNA was undetectable. Combination treatment with ddC at 0.1 pM and rlFNa resulted in significant inhibition of HIV-1 DNA at day 7 (70%) and 14 (60%); viral RNA synthesis was inhibited both at day 7 (80%) and day 14 (70%). Cell viability in these cultures was greater than 95%. A-Z OF TREATMENTS 105 [Page 106](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/112?q1=directories) James reported that in vitro studies conducted by Wellcome have suggested that the triple-drug combination of AZT, ddC and alpha interferon is synergistic in its inhibition of the cytopathic effect of both laboratory and ex vivo strains of HIV. Key research on oral alpha interferon Koech studied low-dose (2 units/kg/duy) natural human alpha interferon (Hayashibara Biochemical Labs) in a preparation that was held in the mouth for mucosal absorption. 38 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic HIV-positive people in Kenya received the treatment for 6 weeks. The investigators reported that all symptomatic patients experienced dramatic relief of constitutional HIV symptoms, weight gain and CD4 cell-count increases. A number of studies have been undertaken in an effort to confirm or disprove these findings. Kaiser enrolled 29 HIV-positive people with CD4 counts between 200 - 500 enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of oral alpha IFN (200 international units/day) with crossover after 6 weeks. Every 2 weeks, a detailed history, physical examination and laboratory tests including CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts were conducted. There was only a slight, transient increase in mean CD4 lymphocyte counts after 4 weeks of treatment with oral alpha IFN, compared with a slight decline when placebo was administered. This effect reached statistical significance in a subgroup of patients only and was not sustained after 6 weeks. There were no significant changes in weight and clinical symptoms. All patients remained HIV-1 antibody positive. Treatment-related adverse reactions were not observed. Sperber reported that no clinical or laboratory effects of 6 weeks' treatment with low-dose oral alpha interferon could be detected in a blinded crossover trial with 8 participants (CD4 counts between 150-600). In May 1992 the US National Institutes of Health's AIDS Research Advisory Committee (ARAC) published a statement which concludes that oral alpha interferon is ineffective as a treatment for HIV infection and recommends that people currently taking the drug seek different treatment. The recommendations are based on the results of a review by the WHO of 13 trials of the drug, none of which was able to replicate the results obtained by Koech. However, in October 1992, a group convened by the National Medical Association recommended that clinical trials be pursued to investigate anecdotal reports that low-dose oral alpha interferon improves HIV-related symptoms. Hulton enrolled 149 people with CD4 count under 700 in an eight-week, placebo-controlled trial of oral alpha IFN (Hayashibara Biochemical Labs). Participants were randomized to receive 50 or 100 units of oral alpha IFN or placebo daily. Low-dose oral alpha IFN did not cause any CD4 count increases or clinical improvements at either 4 or 8 weeks after enrolment. Katabira randomized 560 symptomatic HIV-infected people in Uganda to receive low-dose oral IFN-alpha or placebo. After one year of follow-up, no differences in survival or disease progression were observed between treatment groups. Vento reported rapid, profound decline in the CD4 counts of three asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals with HCV-related chronic active hepatitis treated with alpha interferon; they hypothesize that the drug may exacerbate harmful autoimmune reactions in certain people. Soriano reported that 4/38 HIV-positive people treated for hepatitis C with alpha interferon experienced a greater than 50% fall in CD4 count. Partial or complete CD4 count recovery was seen in one person after stopping interferon and one while contiinung interferon. Generally a more promounced fall in CD4 count was seen within 2-10 weeks of beginning interferon and was observed significantly more often in people who were not receiving AZT than in those who were.

In the test-tube it is active against MAI organisms and it is being studied in combination with other drugs for treating the condition. It is administered by intramuscular or intravenous injection. Side-effects can include hearing, balance and kidney abnormalities. Amikacin is also known as amikacin sulphate. It is manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the tradename Amikin. * Amphotericin B Amphotericin B is a naturally occurring compound produced by Streptomyces nodosus. It has powerful anti-fungal activity; it works by binding irreversibly to ergosterol, a major component of the fungal cell membrane. Amphotericin B is manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The tablet form of amphotericin B, marketed under the brandname Fungilin, is approved for the treatment of candidiasis in the intestines. The intravenous form, called Fungizone, is approved for the treatment of severe or systemic fungal infections such as cryptococcal meningitis, aspergillosis, Amphotericin lozenges can be an effective treatment for Candida in the mouth. Serious side-effects are common, including azotemia (the abnormal presence of urea and other nitrogen substances in the blood), fever, chills, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, anaemia, kidney problems, thromboplebitis (inflammation of the veins and blood clot formation), headache and potassium deficiency. A liposome-encapsulated form is approved in the UK for the treatment of severe or systemic fungal infections. It is a liquid which is administered by intravenous infusion. It is manufactured by Vestar under the tradename AmBisome. The liposomal form causes fewer side-effects than conventional amphotericin B. A molecule called Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) which consists of two fatty (lipid) substances called DMPC and DMPG and amphotericin B is being tested as a treatment for cryptococcal meningitis, systemic candidiasis and coccidioidomycosis. Its side-effects include transient increases in transaminases, transient renal toxicity, fever and chills. References Maserati R et al.

Its side-effects can include nausea, diarrhoea and rashes; rashes seem to be more likely in people with HIV than in uninfected people. Ampicilin should not be used by people who are allergic to penicillin. Ampicillin is usually taken in tablet form, although an intravenous infusion is also available for severe infections. The tablets should be taken at least half an hour before food. There is some evidence that taking ampicillin can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. * Ampligen Ampligen is a synthetic RNA molecule. Test-tube studies showed that it stimulated the cellular immune system by stimulating interferon production and activating natural killer cells. Ampligen and AZT are synergistic in vitro. Ampligen is manufactured by HEM Pharmaceutical Corporation of Philadelphia, USA under the tradename Atvogen. Current use Ampligen is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Phase I studies of ampligen have produced conflicting results. One trial in 10 people suggested that the drug reduced levels of HIV in the blood and stabilised or increased CD4 counts, while another study in 39 people found no evidence of any anti-HIV effects, but stabilisation of CD4 counts at higher dose levels. In October 1988 a large-scale phase III clinical trial was halted after at least as many ampligen recipients as placebo recipients progressed from ARC to AIDS. The manufacturer subsequently claimed that this was because the drug interacted with the plastic bags it was stored it. A small trial in 1991 did suggest that the drug stored in glass ampoules might have beneficial effects on the CD4 count. A further multicentre placebo controlled trial began in 1990. A-Z OF TREATMENTS 107 [Page 108](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/114?q1=directories) Side-effects of the drug are minimal, but may include mild, transient, flu-like symptoms, flushing, chest tightness, transient neutropenia and malaise. Retrogen is a similar drug with in vitro efficacy, which has not yet been tested in vivo. Use in combinations Trials of the combination of ampligen and AZT have not yet produced any definitive results, although in the test-tube the combination seems to be very effective against strains of HIV that have developed resistance to AZT. Getting it Ampligen is only available through clinical trials, but none is currently taking place in Britain. Current developments An oral form of ampligen called Oragen has been developed. Tests in mice suggest that it is effective against the murine (mouse) hepatitis virus. Key research Ampligen is a mismatched, double-stranded RNA molecule. It is a polynucleotide derivative of poly I - poly C with occasional uracil residues to provide RNase cleavage sites. Mitchell reported that in vitro ampligen and AZT are synergistic. Montefiori reported that pre-treatment with ampligen (10-50 pg/ml) afforded significant protection agianst subsequent HIV infection to the highly HIV-permissive T-cell line C3 and to the T-lymphoblastoid cell line CEM in vitro. Antiviral activity was increased by the continued presence of ampligen in cultures following virus challenge. A one-time exposure to ampligen (50 pg/ml) provided greater antiviral activity than either a one-time exposure to recombinant IFN-alpha (250 international units/ml), IFN-beta (250 IU/ml), or IFN-gamma (50 IU/ml) in cultures of CEM cells, or a one-time exposure to a combination of all three IFNs (150 IU each per ml) in cultures of C3 cells. Ampligen had no effect on cell division, RNA and protein synthesis, or virus replication in all T-cell lines examined. Hendrix conducted a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study in 4 healthy volunteers in which participants received either ampligen (single 200 mg intravenous dose) or placebo for 7 days each. No clinical, immunologic or laboratory effects were noted. Carter treated 10 people with ARC or AIDS with ampligen. A reduction in HIV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a reduction of HIV load as measured by coculture, an increase in or maintenance of the number of CD4 cells and augmentation of delayed-type skin hypersensitivity reactions were observed. No toxic reactions were reported. Armstrong enrolled 39 people with asymptomatic HIV infection or early ARC and CD4 counts below 500 in a phase la/lb open-label trial (ACTG 038). Participants received ampligen (10 mg, 40 mg, 120 mg, 270 mg, 405 mg or 570 mg/m ) intravenously twice a week for 9 to 25 weeks. No significant anti-HIV effect could be detected by virological tests. Participants who received the two lower doses had a significant decline in their CD4 count, but in those receiving higher doses (more than 120 mg/m2 intravenously twice a week) no significant CD4 decline occurred which was dose related. A multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled Phase III study known as AMP101 was halted after 20 participants with ARC progressed to AIDS, 12 of whom were receiving ampligen. The manufacturer subsequently claimed that the plastic bags in which ampligen was stored during this study caused structural changes in the drug. Strayer (1990) treated 20 people with ARC or pre-ARC (mean CD4 count 196) with Ampligen formulated in glass bottles (100-200 mg intravenously twice weekly) for 4.5-36 months. 1/20 developed an 01 after 16 months. The frequency of Ols was compared to a similar cohort of ARC/pre-ARC patients who received placebo in a multicentre study of ampligen (AMP101, above). Ampligen increased time to 01, decreased p24 and increased CD4 count compared to placebo. In contrast similar patients receiving ampligen formulated in plastic IV bags developed 01 at a rate no different from placebo recipients. Physiochemical studies showed that the plastic bag formulation yielded a drug with a higher sedimentation value, shorter RNase resistant cores and reduced ability to activate 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase, suggesting that the similar progression rates in the placebo and ampligen arms in the AMP101 study was related to structural changes in ampligen upon exposure to plastic bags. Strayer (1993) assigned 16 AZT-treated people with CD4 counts between 300 and 500 to receive intravenous infusions of ampligen (400 or 700 mg twice weekly) or placebo. One ampligen receipient and 4 placebo recipients progressed to AIDS during the 48 week course of the study. Hendrix reported that a single 200 mg intravenous injection of ampligen had no immunological effects. References Armstrong JA et al.

Anti-B4-blocked ricin is an experimental, intravenously administered monoclonal antibody linked to a blocked ricin (a plant toxin). Blocking the ricin prevents it from binding to most cells, while the anti-B4 antibody targets the molecule to malignant B cells. It is being studied for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in AIDS. No toxicity information is available. * Aspirin Aspirin is a widely used pain-relieving, fever-reducing and anti-inflammatory drug. It is being investigated as a treatment for people with HIV because it inhibits prostaglandins, natural body substances which in test-tube studies can stimulate HIV to start replicating in latently infected cells. Prostaglandins may also activate other cytokines which may stimulate HIV replication such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Aspirin is also known as acetylsalicylic acid. Current use The use of aspirin as an anti-HIV treatment is experimental. Trials testing its effects are underway. High doses of aspirin can cause stomach irritation or ulceration and may interfere with platelet function, slowing down the time it takes for wounds to stop bleeding. Trial participants also receive sucralfate (4 g/day) to reduce stomach irritation. Aspirin is available over-the-counter from chemists and other shops. There are other anti-inflammatory drugs that may have the same effect such as sulphasalazine, an approved treatment for moderate ulcerative colitis, and as adjunctive therapy in severe ulcerative colitis. Doctors treating 3 HIV-positive 108 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 109](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/115?q1=directories) people with sulphasalazine for arthritis noticed CD4 increases. In non-HIV-infected people, the most frequent side-effects include anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, gastric distress and reversible reduction in sperm count. Key research Kotler reported that an aspirin derivative called 5-ASA inhibited the production of p24 antigen in vitro. In this experiment, tissue samples from rectal biopsies of HIV-infected people were incubated with the prostaglandins PGE2 and the leukotriene LTB4, both of which stimulated p24 production. The addition of 5-ASA inhibited this stimulatory effect, as well as the stimulatory effect of tumour necrosis factor. Disla treated 3 people with Reiter's syndrome and HIV with sulphasalazine (1.5 -2 g/day orally) for arthritis control. It was incidentally observed that their CD4 counts increased from a mean of 323 at baseline to 540 after treatment. None received anti-retroviral therapy. References Disla E et al.

SAtevirdine Atevirdine is reverse transcriptase - the family of anti-HIV drugs to which L-697,661 and nevirapine also belong. These drugs act by inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme, but in a different way from the nucleoside analogue drugs like AZT, ddC and ddl. In test-tube studies, atevirdine inhibits HIV-1, but has no activity against HIV-2 or animal retroviruses such as FeLV or SIV. It is equally effective against AZT-sensitive and AZT-resistant strains of HIV-1. Atevirdine (sometimes abbreviated to ATV) belongs to the BHAP class of compounds and is also known as BHAP-E or by the codename U-87201 E. It is manufactured by Upjohn. Current use Atevirdine is an unlicensed, experimental drug which is still in the early stages of research. Trials are testing it on its own and in combination with AZT. Side-effects may include fever, rash, hepatitis and malaise. Liver abnormalities were seen among HIV-negative women who took the drug during phase I testing, but not among men. In animal tests - but not in people - higher levels of the drug reached the bloodstream in females compared with males given the same dose. An Australian pilot study suggested that atevirdine may be an effective treatment for AIDS dementia complex. 10 HIV-positive people with dementia who were intolerant of AZT and ddl were treated with the drug at a dose of 600 mg every three days for 12 weeks. 4 of the 5 who completed the course improved significantly. Of the 5 who were unable to complete the treatment, 4 developed other illnesses that were fatal in 3 cases, and 1 developed a rash that is thought to be related to the atevirdine treatment. The development of HIV strains that are resistant to atevirdine has been reported among people receiving the drug on its own or in combination with AZT. Key research In vitro resistance to BHAP compounds develops rapidly. Sardana reported that BHAP-resistant virus results from a single amino-acid substitution. Dueweke reported that a mutation which confers resistance to BHAP compounds may increase viral sensitivity to other non-nucleoside RT inhibitors such as nevirapine and TIBOL. Romero reported that in vitro atevirdine inhibited replication of HIV-1 in human lymphocytes (EDso = 0.001 M in PBMC) as well as HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (ICso = 1.3pM). In vitro, U-87201E also inhibited both AZT-sensitive and AZT-resistant clinical isolates obtained at different times from the same patient. Atevirdine did not inhibit the replication of HIV-2 or any other retrovirus tested. Romero also demonstrated that atevirdine (200 mg/kg) protected 3/8 SCID-hu mice from intravenous HIV-1 infection. In the mice that became infected, levels of HIV DNA were lower by factors of 5 to 10 in treated mice compared with untreated controls. In preclinical animal studies administration of atevirdine resulted in higher blood levels and more toxicity at higher doses in female animals than in males. Batts reported that in a study in uninfected adults atevirdine (200 mg 4 times daily) produced elevations of hepatic enzymes in 3 women but none of the men, which were reversible after drug was discontinued. Contrary to the animal experience, there was no significant difference in the PK of women versus men. Borleffs conducted a dose-escalating study of atevirdine (400 mg, 800 mg, 1200 mg, 1600 mg) alternating with placebo in 24 asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals. Safety and tolerance of the drug did not differ from placebo. Preliminary results from doses up to 1200 mg showed mean Cmx (peak blood concentration) of 0.88 mg/ml (400 mg), 2.42 mg/ml (800 mg) and 3.30 mg/ml (1200 mg). Brew treated 10 people who had AIDS dementia complex stage 1 or 2, AZT or ddl intolerance or failure, neurological impairment and no confounding illness with atevirdine (600 mg every 3 days for 12 weeks). 5/10 completed the protocol; of these 4 responded as measured by a decline in the mean combined impairment score from 19.6 at baseline to 5 at week 12. Improvement in responders was evident at week 4. Two participants improved from AIDS dementia complex stage 2 to stage 0, and two from stage 1 to stage 0.5. CSF beta2-microglobulin and neopterin levels also improved. Of the 5 non-responders, 4 developed infections that were fatal in 3 cases and 1 discontinued due to a drug-related rash. Campbell reported that clinical isolates with a wide range of ICs0s of AZT and ddl were inhibited by atevirdine. Cross-resistance to atevirdine in AZTor ddl-resistant isolates was not observed. Combinations of atevirdine and AZT were highly synergistic against AZT-resistant clinical isolates of HIV-1. By contrast, these combinations were mostly additive when tested against AZT-susceptible isolates. Combinations of atevirdine and ddl were additive in their effects against both ddl-susceptible and -resistant isolates. In a phase I study, 1/3 participants developed resistance to atevirdine after an average of 8 weeks' treatment. Demeter tested obtained clinical isolates from 16 people who had received atevirdine and AZT for 6-28 weeks (median of 16 weeks) in a phase I trial (ACTG 199). 5/9 individuals treated for more than 16 weeks had HIV-1 isolates sensitive to atevirdine. 4/9 developed resistance to atevirdine between weeks 6 and 24 of treatment. Reichman conducted a phase I study of atevirdine (1800 mg/day) in combination with AZT (600 mg/day). No resistance was detected at weeks 0, 6 and 12. 2 participants developed fever or rash, one had hepatitis and one experienced malaise. References Batts D et al.

SAtovaquone Atovaquone is a recently developed anti-protozoal drug. It is active against the cyst and trophozoite forms of Toxoplasma in cell culture. It is approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP in people intolerant of standard therapies following studies that showed that it was somewhat less effective but better tolerated than co-trimoxazole. Ongoing studies are testing its use as a treatment for PCP, toxoplasmosis and microsporidiosis. Atovaquone was previously known by the codename BW566C80. It is manufactured by Wellcome under the tradename Mepron. Taking it Atovaquone is currently available in tablet-form on a named patient basis for the treatment of toxoplasmosis or PCP for people with a documented history of intolerance to or lack of efficacy with approved first-line agents. The drug is not well absorbed in the gut, and should be taken with a fatty meal to maximise absorption. Side-effects can include rash, nausea and fever. Taking the anti-tuberculosis drug rifampin at the same time as atovaquone dramatically reduces blood levels of atovaquone. Current developments A suspension formulation, which seems to be better absorbed, is currently being evaluated. An atovaqone pro-drug (i.e. a drug that breaks down into atovaquone in the body) called 17C91 and an intravenous formulation are also being developed. References Falloon J et al.

SAutologous CD8 infusion CD8 cells are immune cells which play a key role in the cellular immune response (as opposed to the humoral immune response, which involves antibodies). They are sometimes referred to as cytotoxic T-cells, because they are able to detect and kill cells which have been infected by foreign organisms, including HIV-infected cells in test-tube studies. Research suggests that CD8 cells may be central to the body's initial strong immune response following infection with HIV, which dramatically reduces the amount of virus that can be detected in the blood. Their importance is also indicated by evidence that people with high levels of CD8 cells may have a better prognosis than people with lower levels. Tests in chimpanzees have suggested that the reason why these animals do not suffer immune damage when inoculated with HIV may be due to their CD8 lymphocytes' ability to inhibit HIV replication. Dr Jay Levy has shown that CD8 cells secrete a previously unknown substance that he has named CD8 antiviral factor, or CAF. CAF is a highly effective inhibitor of HIV replication. Levy has shown that in blood or lymph node samples taken from long-term asymptomatic people, HIV cannot replicate in the presence of CD8 cells. CAF is produced at high levels by the CD8 cells of people who are asymptomatic with strong CD8 responses, but little or no CAF is produced by the CD8 cells of people with symptoms. CD8 cells from uninfected as well as HIV-positive people secrete substances that can inhibit HIV replication. Autologous CD8 infusion is a treatment in which CD8 cells are isolated from an HIV-infected person and stimulated by natural cell-activating proteins such as interleukin-2. They are then reinfused into the body in the hope that they will exert a stronger anti-HIV effect. Current use Autologous CD8 infusion is an unlicensed, experimental treatment. The procedure is being tested in the USA using a device called the CELLector, manufactured by Applied Immune Science (AIS), which isolates CD8 cells in the presence of interleukin-2. A phase I study demonstrated the technique to be safe with preliminary evidence of efficacy. Some researchers believe that any benefits will be slight and may in fact be attributable to the interleukin-2 rather than the CD8 cells. One potential drawback is that any HIV-infected cells which are present during activation are likely to be stimulated to produce increased amounts of HIV. It is also unclear how long the CD8 cells would continue to have beneficial effects once reinfused into the body. It is also possible that the CD8 cells might attack uninfected, healthy CD4 cells which have bound onto the gpl 20 protein released from HIV-infected cells. No significant toxicities or adverse effects have been observed except for flu-like symptoms during the interleukin-2 infusion. Getting it No studies into autologous CD8 infusion are taking place in Britain and the treatment is not known to be available through other means. Key research Walker (1986) reported that CD8 lymphocytes are capable of suppressing the replication of HIV in autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with AIDS. Walker (1987) demonstrated that HIV-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) were capable of killing HIV-infected autologous B cells in 8/8 seropositive individuals. However, Walker (1991) reported that HIV can spread to uninfected CD4 cells in culture even in the presence of CD8 cells. Castro demonstrated that in HIV-infected chimpanzees CD8 lymphocytes suppress HIV replication in PBMC cultures. Levy reported that CD8 cells from long-term asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals - but not people with advanced HIV disease - secrete CD8 Antiviral Factor (CAF), a potent inhibitor of in vitro HIV replication. Tsuchie demonstrated that CD8 cells from uninfected people also secrete cytokines that inhibit HIV in vitro. Buchbinder found that 8% of HIV-positive gay men in a San Francisco cohort had maintained CD4 counts above 500 despite being infected for at least 10 years. These non-progressors were significantly more likely to have 1 10 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 111](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/117?q1=directories) a low viral load and a high CD8 count than progressors. Easterbrook reported that non-progressors in a study at the Kobler Centre in London tended to have high levels of CD8 cells compared with matched progressors, and the CD8 cells from 6 individuals tested demonstrated env and gag-specific lysis in 6/6 and 2/6 respectively. Ho conducted a Phase I study to determine the safety and feasibility of infusing in vitro purified, activated and expanded CD8 cells as a therapeutic measure in 7 people with ARC or AIDS. Autologous CD8 cells were first selectively isolated in monoclonal antibody-coated flasks from peripheral blood mononuclear cells recovered by leukapheresis. They were then cultured and expanded with phytohemagglutinin and recombinant interleukin-2 (rlL-2) before infusion. Five cycles of isolations and infusions of increasing numbers of CD8 T cells were achieved in 5/7 participants. Five cycles could not be completed in 2 participants with AIDS whose CD4 cell counts were less than or equal to 48. Infusions of CD8 cells alone were well tolerated. 4 patients received rlL-2 by continuous infusion for 5 days with their final cycle of CD8 cells. All developed reversible adverse effects attributable to rlL-2. After infusion, indium-labelled CD8 cells quickly accumulated in the lungs, with less than 10% of the labelled cells remaining in the circulation. After 24 hours, labelled CD8 cells were reduced in the lungs, but increased and persisted in liver, spleen and bone marrow. 4/5 patients who were treated with multiple infusions of CD8 cells improved or remained clinically stable and the fifth developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia but recovered. Klimas enrolled 6 HIV-positive individuals (entry CD4 range 84-500) in a phase I study of autologous CD8 infusion with IL-2. The CD8 fraction from peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained by pheresis was isolated in the CD8 CELLector device and expanded for 14-21 days with PHA and IL-2. Treatment consisted of 5 ex vivo infusions of 108-101 cells every 2-3 weeks, followed by outpatient continuous infusion of IL2 (1 x 106/m2) for 5 days. No adverse effects were seen during the cell infusions; mild adverse effects were seen during IL-2 infusion. Clinical improvement was observed in lymphadenopathy (6 out of 6), oral hairy leucoplakia (3 out of 4) and KS (2 out of 2). The manufacturer reports that indium labelling revealed that 90% of the cells were sequestered in the lung, liver, spleen and bone and that in vitro, the expanded cells had CTL activity against HIV gag, pol and env genes. Lieberman has enrolled 17 people with CD4 counts between 100 - 400 in an open-label, dose-escalating study of an autologous CD8 infusion procedure (DATRI 006). The procedure differs from the one used by Ho in that the cell lines are selected for in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity and concurrent IL-2 is not administered. 6 participants received single infusions of 1 billion cells and three patients received single infusions of 5 billion cells; no toxicity has been observed. Transient CD4 increases were observed in several patients. Among 5 patients in whom virus could be detected, 2 had sustained, significant decreases in viral burden. References Buchbinder S et al.

It is licensed for treating respiratory tract infections, infections of the middle ear, skin and soft tissue infections and chlamydia. It is manufactured by Richborough under the tradename Zithromax. It is also being tested as a treatment for MAI, cryptosporidiosis, bacillary angiomatosis and toxoplasmosis. In laboratory tests it is active against both the cyst and the trophozoite forms of Toxoplasma. Side-effects from azithromycin are quite unusual, but can include stomach upsets.

AZT AZT is a modified form of one of the building blocks of DNA (known as nucleosides), like ddl and ddC. When HIV replicates in the presence of these nucleoside analogue drugs, the virus' reverse transcriptase enzyme incorporates the drug in the place of a normal nucleoside in the growing DNA strand. This prevents the proper assembly of viral genetic material and halts viral replication. It is manufactured by The Wellcome Foundation Ltd and was the first drug licensed for treating HIV infection. AZT is an abbreviation for the chemical name azidothymidine. The drug is often referred to by its generic name, zidovudine, which is abbreviated to ZDV. It is manufactured under the tradename Retrovir. Current use AZT is a licensed treatment for HIV infection. It is the standard treatment for people who have developed HIV-related symptoms or AIDS, following a 1985 study of 281 people who had already been diagnosed with symptoms of AIDS that included PCP. Compared with participants who received an inactive placebo, people treated with AZT (1200 mg/day) showed a significant improvement in survival, fewer opportunistic infections and a rise in CD4 cell counts. On the basis of this study the drug was licensed in most countries for the treatment of HIV-infected people with symptoms. The methodology of this trial has been called into question and there do seem to have been significant irregularities. Nevertheless, a number of subsequent observational studies have also suggested that people with AIDS who take AZT tend to live longer and experience fewer opportunistic infections than those who do not. This was the conclusion from longer-term follow-up of the original trial; from follow-up of people who received AZT through a compassionate plea programme before the drug was licensed; from an Italian observational study comparing A-Z OF TREATMENTS 1 1 1 [Page 112](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/118?q1=directories) 159 AZT-treated people with 112 contemporary untreated people; and from an American natural history study comparing the survival of AZT-treated people with reported survival of people with AIDS prior to AZT's availability. People taking AZT consistently experience an increase in CD4 counts, although this tends to return to its pre-treatment level after a few months. AZT was originally licensed at a high dosage of 1200 mg per day, based on the original trial. Then a trial of 67 symptomatic patients with CD4 cell counts between 200 and 500 showed that immunological and virological improvements were similar with doses of 300 mg, 600 mg or 1500 mg daily. In early 1990, an ACTG study found that 600 mg/day was just as effective, but caused fewer side-effects, than 1500 mg/day. As a result, the recommendations were that the lower dose of 600 mg should now be given. A further study has even suggested that 300 mg/day may be the most effective dose. However, ACTG 106, a trial comparing combinations of ddC and AZT with low dose AZT alone, concluded that 150 mg/day is too low. Trials all over the world are continuing to investigate a range of doses. There may be no single correct dose and it may be that dosage should be tailored to your weight, disease state and other drugs taken at the same time. Use in asymptomatic HIV infection AZT is also licensed for the treatment of symptom-free people whose CD4 count is below 200, or whose CD4 count is below 500 and falling rapidly. This is based on a 1989 placebo-controlled trial called ACTG 019, which enrolled 1338 asymptomatic people. The results indicated that, in the short term, AZT delayed progression to severe symptomatic disease, or AIDS. There was no difference between the doses of 500 mg/day and 1500 mg/day. A separate arm of the study ACTG 019 compared the effects of AZT or a placebo for people with CD4 counts above 500. The results, reported in summer 1994, showed no clinical benefit such as a delay in symptoms from starting AZT this early, although AZT recipients did sustain a higher CD4 count than those given placebo. There have been a number of other studies also investigating the effects of AZT for people with asymptomatic infection. A study known as EACG 020 which enrolled nearly 1000 asymptomatic people with CD4 counts above 400 found that after two years, AZT recipients were less likely to develop a CD4 count below 350 or 'clinical HIV disease' than people given a placebo. Similarly, the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study (VA 298) comparing early with late use of AZT in people with mild symptoms found that early use slightly delayed progression to AIDS, but did not prolong survival as compared with late use. However, the largest single study of AZT in asymptomatic HIV infection, known as Concorde, produced different results. The Concorde study suggest that when viewed over the longer term there may be no advantage in starting AZT before symptoms develop. The full results of the Anglo-French trial were published in April 1994. It enrolled 1749 asymptomatic participants, making it the most powerful study of AZT in asymptomatic HIV infection ever conducted. Participants were randomly assigned either to start taking 1 g of AZT a day, or to receive a placebo until they developed symptoms or until they chose to switch from trial capsules to open AZT because of falling CD4 counts. Thus the trial compared the strategy of immediate AZT treatment when asymptomatic compared with deferring AZT treatment until later in the course of HIV disease. The results showed that after three years there was no detectable difference between immediate versus deferred use of AZT in terms of disease progression, development of AIDS or survival. Concorde's results suggest that AZT has at most a modest effect in delaying disease progression and that people who choose to take AZT when asymptomatic may not live any longer than those who delay taking AZT until they develop low CD4 counts or HIV-related symptoms. In common with the other trials, Concorde participants who took AZT from the beginning of the trial were also less likely to have developed mild symptoms after one year. The key difference between Concorde and those other studies is that Concorde continued for long enough to show that over the longer term this advantage was lost. On the basis of these results there is no consensus about whether it is better to treat with AZT earlier rather than later. There are unresolved arguments suggesting two alternative approaches to the timing of therapy with AZT. One view would argue that there is evidence that AZT treatment only provides a fixed period of benefit at whatever stage it is begun since there is no evidence of increased survival with earlier use (as opposed to later use) of AZT. Consequently, since viral resistance to AZT may develop after a number of months of treatment, it might make more sense to 'hold it in reserve' for whenever symptomatic illness may develop. The possible advantages of delaying disease progression must be weighed against disadvantages that include a possible reduction in quality of life due to side-effects from AZT - one study suggested that this loss of quality of life cancelled out any improvement in quality of life due to reduced disease progression. Additionally, the long-term side-effects of AZT are not yet known. The advantages of this approach might include a greater sense of well-being by not taking any medicine whilst asymptomatic and the reassurance that in the event of AIDS-related symptoms developing, the full benefits of AZT are still going to be available. The alternative view would argue that if AZT treatment provides a fixed but limited period of benefit whenever it is taken, it might make more sense to maximise the symptom-free period of life and delay damage to the immune system for as long as possible. However, it is important to remember that the Concorde trial suggests that AZT monotherapy can at best only prevent minor HIV-related symptoms in the short term and not delay the development of AIDS. Whilst recognising that the benefits of AZT would probably not then be available in the event of AIDS-related symptoms developing, this view takes the more optimistic view that other antiviral drugs or combinations of antiviral drugs will become available in the future to take the place of AZT when its effectiveness against HIV 'runs out'. In addition, it may be that people will not need to take AZT for a long time (and thus not encounter long-term side-effects) as alternative drugs to AZT may become licensed in the future. The advantages of this approach might also include a sense of control in one's life as a result of starting treatment against HIV disease. It seems probable that of a group of people with HIV infection of a similar stage, some will respond well to early 112 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 113](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/119?q1=directories) AZT treatment and others will not respond or will even do worse on early AZT than they would on no treatment. Unfortunately, the trials to date have not provided clues on how to identify these sub-groups of people, so that treatment could be tailored to the individual. Use in combinations Studies of the combination of AZT with a number of other drugs are currently underway. The reasoning behind combination therapy is that attacking the virus with two or more different drugs may increase the level of antiviral effectiveness, while reducing the risk of the virus developing resistance to treatment. It may also allow the use of lower doses of each drug, so lessening the likelihood of side-effects. Some trials are testing combinations of drugs that are 'convergent' i.e. the drugs all act against HIV in the same way, such as combinations of the reverse transcriptase inhibitors AZT, ddC, ddl and/or nevirapine. 'Divergent' combinations are those in which the drugs target different stages in HIV's lifecycle, such as AZT plus a protease inhibitor. Very preliminary research suggests that combinations that include AZT may not be very effective for people who have already developed AZT-resistant virus. If true, this would be an argument for taking combinations of AZT plus other drugs early, rather than as a later option after a period of AZT monotherapy. This theory is consistent with the results of the only large trial of AZT plus ddC to date, which found no advantage to the combination as compared with ddC alone for people who had already taken AZT for an average of 12 months. The Medical Research Council's Delta trial comparing AZT monotherapy with combinations of AZT with ddC or ddl is taking place at many clinics throughout the UK. The MRC is also coordinating PENTA 3, a trial testing the safety and tolerance of the combination of AZT with ddC in children. Reducing HIV transmission In July 1994 AZT was licensed as a treatment to reduce the risk of HIV transmission from HIV-positive pregnant women to their infants following the results of an American trial. The trial enrolled 477 women between 14 and 36 weeks of pregnancy with CD4 counts above 200. They were randomly assigned to take either AZT (500 mg/day) or an inactive placebo during pregnancy. During labour, the women received a continuous intravenous infusion of either AZT or placebo, and for the first 6 weeks of life the babies received either AZT or placebo as a syrup. The results showed that transmission occurred in 25.5% of the placebo group but only 8.3% of the AZT group. There are still several unanswered questions about this use of AZT. Although there were no short-term side-effects other than reversible mild anaemia, long-term follow-up is underway to assess the effects of AZT on the growth and development of the babies. It is unclear whether the reduction in transmission seen in this study was due to the tablet-form AZT taken during pregnancy, or the intravenous dose during labour, or the syrup after birth, or all three. Studies have also investigated whether health-care and public safety workers who are exposed to possible HIV infection through, for example, needlestick injuries, can reduce the risk of infection by taking AZT for a period of weeks immediately following the exposure. To date, however, there is no evidence that AZT does reduce the already very small risk of infection. Side-effects When first prescribed, AZT was given in doses which caused a high incidence of side-effects in the short term - although it seems clear that asymptomatic people can tolerate higher doses, such as the 1000 mg/day given in the Concorde trial, without experiencing the acute side-effects that such doses often cause in people with AIDS. Early problems which tend to subside after the first few weeks of taking AZT include nausea or vomiting, headache, a feeling of fatigue or weakness and/or muscle pain, although in some people these problems persist for longer. AZT is known to cause bone marrow damage, particularly at higher doses and in more advanced HIV infection. This means that after several months on the drug a proportion of individuals develop anaemia and sometimes deficiencies in other cells in the blood (e.g. neutropenia - depletion of neutrophils). These haematological problems have become less frequent since the doses used have been reduced to less than 1000 mg/day. If someone has other reasons for developing anaemia, such as having MAI or taking other drugs that can cause anaemia such as ganciclovir, taking AZT may result in more severe side-effects. In people with low levels of the protein erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates increased production of red blood cells, these can be managed to some extent by treatment with artificial (recombinant) EPO. Alternatively the dose of AZT may have to be reduced, or treatment temporarily or permanently stopped. There is some risk of muscle damage after prolonged treatment with AZT, with some pain, wasting and weakness usually in the muscles around the hips, thighs and buttocks. This can be picked up early on in blood tests of muscle enzymes and can be improved by reducing the dose or stopping treatment with AZT. Other side-effects sometimes reported from AZT include fatigue, rashes, severe muscle pain and inflammation (myopathy), nausea, insomnia, nail discolouration, kidney disorders and headaches. These toxicities are usually more common and more serious in people with AIDS and advanced ARC than in people with asymptomatic infection. Enlarged fatty liver and lactic acidosis have been reported and may be infrequent adverse reactions to AZT therapy. These complications are rare but the risk appears to be greater in obese women and people with risk factors for liver disease. There has been speculation that long-term use of AZT may cause cancer. This is based on laboratory studies and tests in rats and mice. However, there is no evidence to date that long-term use of AZT causes cancer in humans. In August 1990 a study estimated that an unexpectedly high proportion of people with AIDS, treated with AZT, who had survived for three years would develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a cancer of the immune system. This suggestion caused much concern that the NHL might be caused by therapy with AZT. However, NHL has been seen in people with AIDS since the early years of the epidemic, before AZT was ever used. Most researchers believe that the increased incidence of NHL may be explained by the A-Z OF TREATMENTS 113 [Page 114](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/120?q1=directories) fact that people taking AZT are surviving longer in a state of severe immunosuppression. This belief is supported by the fact that in other studies, less-immunosuppressed patients treated with AZT for a similar length of time do not show an increased incidence of NHL. A recent study of the occurrence of NHL in people with AIDS at St Mary's Hospital in London (Peters) found no evidence that people on long-term AZT (more than 36 months) or people who have taken a high cumulative dose of AZT are at increased risk of NHL compared with people who have taken little or no AZT. An earlier study of the incidence of NHL in London (Cottrill) showed that out of 100 patients who developed the cancer, 57% had had no prior AIDS-defining symptoms and of 84 for whom data is available, 48 (57%) had not taken any AZT prior to being diagnosed with NHL. In other words, NHL is an HIV-related condition and many people who develop NHL have never taken AZT. A review of 43 HIV-positive women who took AZT at doses between 300 and 1200 mg/day during pregnancy found no pattern of adverse outcomes which was attributable to maternal AZT therapy. All 45 infants were delivered alive. Specifically, there was no evidence that maternal AZT use increased the risk of premature birth, growth retardation or birth defects, although the small number of infants involved meant that the possibility that AZT taken during pregnancy can have harmful effects on unborn children could not be definitively ruled out. Since 1989 the US Centres for Disease Control in conjunction with Wellcome have operated a Zidovudine in Pregnancy Registry. To date, birth defects have been reported in 2.2% of the infants of women who received AZT during the first trimester of pregancy. The expected proportion in the general population is 3%, suggesting that AZT does not cause an increase in birth defects. A study in which AZT was administered to macaque monkeys from early in pregnancy also found no evidence that the drug caused birth defects among the offspring, although the results of such animal studies cannot automatically be assumed to apply to humans. Resistance A number of studies have shown that, after several months of AZT treatment, strains of HIV develop within the body that are resistant to the drug. It is suspected that the development of resistance may partly explain why the effectiveness of AZT (measured in terms of CD4 cell count and blood levels of the viral protein p24) decreases after a few months. Resistant strains take longer to develop in asymptomatic people taking AZT than people with ARC or AIDS and are less likely to be highly resistant to AZT. HIV that has become resistant to one antiviral drug usually remains susceptible to others, although research published in 1994 which pooled data from 4 medical centres in the USA suggested that HIV strains that have developed resistance to AZT are also significantly less susceptible to ddl and ddC. This might explain the finding from the trial ACTG 116B/11 7, in which people who taken AZT for at least 16 weeks either continued on AZT switched to ddl. People who had AZT-resistant strains when they joined the study were found to have a worse prognosis regardless of whether they switched to ddl or not. In studies of the development of ddl resistance in HIV that had already become resistant to AZT, the mutation responsible for ddl resistance made the HIV susceptible to AZT again. Laboratory tests also suggest that AZT-resistant strains of HIV might still be effectively treated by combinations of antiviral drugs which include AZT. AZT-resistant strains of HIV tend to regain some susceptibility to AZT treatment on treatment with loviride or other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Taking it Some doctors recommend that people starting AZT treatment begin at a very low dose and gradually build up to the standard dose. This seems to reduce the likelihood of early side-effects such as headache and nausea. Nausea and vomiting may also be reduced by taking AZT before meals; eating a larger number of smaller meals during the day rather than 3 large ones; avoiding large meals, fatty foods and sweets; taking more cool food and drinks rather than hot ones; avoiding spicy and fried foods; drinking water, apple juice, flat ginger ale or cola; or eating dry foods like crackers. Frequent monitoring for blood abnormalities is important when treatment is begun. In most centres blood tests will be performed every fortnight for the first couple of months. People with pre-existing liver or kidney problems may need additional monitoring to ensure that AZT does not worsen these conditions. It is a sensible precaution to inform your doctor if, while you are taking AZT, you experience severe abdominal pain, shortness of breath, unusual tiredness or weakness, unusual bleeding or bruising, sore throat, fever or an injury that wont heal. To achieve maximum AZT levels in the body the drug should be taken on an empty stomach. Getting it Any doctor can prescribe AZT on the NHS for its licensed indications, although it is normally recommended that only doctors who are experienced with the drug should prescribe it. Current developments Studies around the world are continuing to investigate the use of AZT. These include trials of AZT for women, for children and for people taking methadone. Many combination therapy trials are also underway. Researchers have also been testing AZT in the first few weeks following infection. Preliminary results from a European-Australian study suggested that people who had significant symptoms soon after infection ('seroconversion illness' - this is associated with a worse prognosis than people who experience no such symptoms) were less likely to develop a CD4 count or HIV-related disease over a one-year period than those given a placebo. This result remains to be confirmed and it is not known whether these apparent benefits would also extend to people who do not develop seroconversion illness. Laboratory tests have suggested that anti-HIV drugs such as AZT and ddl (alone or in combination) do not have a significant effect on HIV replication in the lymph nodes of people with early HIV infection, where the majority of viral replication takes place. 114 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 115](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/121?q1=directories) The Medical Research Council is participating in the PENTA 1 study comparing early with deferred use of AZT for children with HIV infection. The trial is currently recruiting participants in clinics throughout the country. Key research AZT has been shown to inhibit HIV replication in vitro. AZT, like the other anti-HIV nucleoside analogues, acts as a competitive inhibitor of reverse transcriptose; its incorporation into viral DNA results in premature termination of DNA-chain synthesis. Clerici reported greater than four-fold improvement in T helper cell function in 9/1 2 asymptomatic people and 3/4 people wifh AIDS on AZT therapy. Improved function was detected as early as 5 weeks into therapy in 6 people and continued to be evident for longer than 1 year after start of therapy in 6 participants and for longer than 2 years in 2. No correlation was observed between improved T helper cell function and changes in CD4 or CD8 counts or in levels of serum HIV p24 antigen or beta2-microglobulin. Unadkat has shown that to achieve maximum AZT serum concentrations, AZT should be ingested on an empty stomach. Sattler reported that concurrent treatment with acetaminophen (known as paracetamol in the UK and often called Tylenol in the USA) and AZT for short periods does not increase the risk of development of AZT-induced myelosuppression. Trials in symptomatic disease In March 1987, AZT (1200 mg/day) was approved for the treatment of AIDS and advanced ARC. This approval was based on the results of a double blind placebo-controlled trial in 281 AIDS and ARC people conducted by Fischl (1987). During the 24 week placebo-controlled period one AZT recipient and 19 placebo recipients died. The study was terminated early and participants were offered open-label AZT. Only 15 people completed the planned 24 week trial. Fischl (1989) reported on the long-term safety and efficacy of AZT in a follow-up of this study. 102 people who originally received placebo started AZT treatment (deferred treatment group) and 127 AZT recipients continued AZT (original treatment group). At 12 months, survival rates were 84.5% versus 78.7% for the original treatment group and the deferred treatment group respectively. Creagh-Kirk reported on the survival of people with AIDS who received AZT through a compassionate release programme before it was licensed. 1120 of the 4805 participants were lost to follow-up; these seemed to have slightly more advanced disease and the researchers note that their loss may have resulted in an overestimate of survival in the participants who continued to be followed-up. After 44 weeks of AZT, 2838 (77% of those followed; 59% of those originally enrolled) were reported to be still alive, significantly above the figures previously reported by natural history studies. Vella compared the survival of 159 AZT-treated people with AIDS with that of 112 matched untreated contemporary controls. After 24 months, survival was 45.9% in the treated group and 20.5% in the untreated group, with median survival of 21.2 and 9.6 months respectively. Lundgren studied the association between elapsed time since starting AZT and survival among 4484 people in 17 European countries who survived their initial AIDS-defining event. The death rate among those who did not take any AZt remained approximately constant for the first 5 years following AIDS diagnosis, at about 50%. Among treated people, the death rate within the first year after starting AZT was markedly reduced, but for those surviving more than 2 years after starting AZT the death rate was greater than for untreated people who developed AIDS at the same time. The researchers conclude that AZT has a substantial but temporary beneficial effect on survival when started after AIDS is diagnosed. Moore reported that in an observational study involving 863 AZT-treated people with AIDS or ARC and a CD4 count below 350, median survival was more than 30 months in participants with a baseline CD4 count higher than 350 and 18 months in those with entry CD4 of below 50. These are higher than those described in earlier natural history studies before AZT was available and comparable to those reported by Fischl and Creagh-Kirk. Swanson evaulated 235 men with ARC treated with AZT (1 200 mg/day). Median time to development of AIDS was 61 weeks, compared with 22 weeks in a small control group of 12 untreated people. 48% of participants develoiped anaemia requiring transfusion. Significant differences in time to development of AIDS were found in people not requiring transfusions, with no weight loss and who received the full AZT dose during the first 52 weeks of therapy. AZT-intolerant participants had a significantly shorter time to development of AIDS. Fischl (1990a) reported that the study ACTG 002, which compared high dose (1500 mg/day) to low dose (one month at 1200 mg/day followed by 600 mg/day) AZT in people with AIDS, established that these doses are equally efficacious and that the higher dose is significantly more toxic. After evaluating these results, the FDA lowered the recommended dose of AZT from 1200 mg/day to 600 mg/day. Collier conducted a Phase II open-label, dose-escalating trial to evaluate the clinical and antiviral effects of AZT at low (300 mg daily, 28 participants), medium (600 mg, 24 participants) and high (1500 mg, 15 participants) doses, either with or without acyclovir (4.8 g) by random assignment. Participants had ARC but not AIDS and all had either HIV p24 antigenaemia or plasma viraemia and CD4 counts of 200 to 500 when they began treatment. Performance scores and fatigue improved the most in the lowand medium-dose AZT groups. Those assigned to low-dose AZT gained the most weight and had the greatest improvement in the mean CD4 count (from 321 at baseline to 412 after 12 weeks). 19 participants assigned to receive the low or medium dose who subsequently crossed over to the 1500 mg dose did not have an increase in CD4-cell counts or a decline in levels of HIV antigen, but they did have dose-related toxicity. The addition of acyclovir to AZT was well tolerated, but it did not enhance any of AZT's antiretroviral effects. Trials in asymptomatic infection In March 1990 the FDA expanded the indication for AZT to include all HIV-infected adults with a CD4 cell count below 500. This revision was based on findings from 2 studies, ACTG 016 and 019. Fischl (1990b) reported on ACTG 016 which compared AZT 1200 mg/day to placebo in 711 mildly symptomatic participants with CD4 counts between 200-800 at entry. Among patients with CD4 counts between 200-500, 34/253 placebo recipients and 11/260 AZT recipients progressed to advanced ARC or AIDS (median follow-up 11 months). Volberding (1990) reported on ACTG 019 which compared AZT (either 500 mg/day or 1500 mg/day) to placebo in 1338 asymptomatic people who had CD4 counts below 500 at entry (see below for trial results for people with baseline CD4 counts above 500). 33/428 (8%) placebo recipients and 25/910 (3/%) AZT recipients progressed to AIDS (mean follow-up 55 weeks). While these results indicate that AZT delays the progression of disease in the short-term period, no survival benefit was demonstrated in either study. Volberding (1994a) reported a complex statistical analysis which suggested that the duration of benefit from AZT therapy was related to baseline CD4 cell count, with greater benefit in those with higher counts at entry. The delay in progression diminished over time, especially in participants with baseline CD4 counts less than 300. Lenderking reported an analysis of data from ACTG 019 which included quality of life as an endpoint. The average time with neither a progression of disease nor an adverse event was 15.7, 15.6 and 14.8 months for people receiving placebo, AZT (500 mg/day) and AZT (1500 mg/day) respectively. It is concluded that for asymptomatic people treated with AZT at a dose of 500 mg, a reduction in the quality of life due to severe side-effects of AZT approximately equals the increases in the quality of life associated with a delay in disease progression. Volberding (1994b) reported the results from the stratum of ACTG 019 in which participants had baseline CD4 counts above 500. Again, they were randomly assigned either to AZT at a dose of 500 mg/day or 1500 mg/day or placebo. After the results from the other stratum of the study were reported, the design of this arm of the study was changed so that all participants started to take AZT at a 500 mg/day dose if their CD4 count fell below 500. 1637 people (mean CD4 count 655) were enrolled. No differences between the arms were seen in clinical events such as progression to AIDS or survival. Taking AZT when the CD4 count was above 500 did not delay the onset of AIDS or prolong life compared with delaying treatment until the CD4 count fell below 500. AZT recipients had a CD4 count increase while placebo recipients tended to have a steady CD4 decline. Placebo recipients progressed to a CD4 count below 500 6 months sooner than AZT recipients. This delay in the loss of CD4 cells was particularly pronounced among people who started AZT when their CD4 count was above 650. Sande reported the guidelines on the use of anti-retroviral drugs drawn up by an independent panel convened by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID). These suggest that while AZT is an option to be considered for people with CD4 counts below 500, it is not necessarily indicated for all such people. Asymptomatic people with CD4 counts between 200 and 500 should consider starting treatment, or alternatively should be monitored for evidence of deterioration, at which time therapy should be initiated. The guidelines do recommend AZT therapy for all symptomatic people with CD4 counts below 500. Choi reported that the CD4 count was an incomplete surrogate marker for clinical progression in people in ACTG 019. The lower participants' CD4 count fell, the greater the risk of progression to AIDS. However, it was calculated that the increase in CD4 count seen on AZT could only account for 0-37% of the overall reduction in disease progression seen in people treated with AZT. A substantial portion of AZT's effect on delaying progression to AIDS that was independent of the CD4 level occurred within the first 16 weeks of therapy. In participants who had not progressed to AIDS by week 1 6, most of the subsequent AZT effect in reducing the risk for progression could be explained by its effect on the CD4 percentage A-Z OF TREATMENTS 115 [Page 116](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/122?q1=directories) (percentage of CD4 lymphocytes among all leukocytes) for the first 16 weeks of therapy. The Concorde Coordinating Committee reported the results of the Anglo-French Concorde study, a multi-centre randomised double-blind placebo controlled trial. Concorde was designed to determine whether asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals benefit from starting AZT at randomisation (immediate treatment, IMM) rather than deferring until the onset of symptomatic disease or at least two CD4 counts of less than 500 at least one month apart (deferred treatment, DEF). 877 IMM participants were initially allocated to AZT (250 mg four times a day) and 872 DEF participants to matching placebo. Those in the IMM group spent 81% of total time on study prior to progression to ARC or AIDS on AZT compared with only 16% for the DEF group. Median changes in CD4 count from baseline were +20 IMM and -9 DEF at 3 months, a difference which was consistently observed up to three years. By contrast, however, there was no statistically significant difference in clinical outcome between the two groups. The 3-year estimated survival probabilities were 92% in IMM and 94% in DEF; 3-year progression rates to AIDS were 18% in both groups and to ARC, AIDS or death were 29% (IMM) and 32% (DEF). However, at 1 year there was an early but transient delay in progression to ARC, AIDS or death in favour of the IMM group; this consisted largely in a reduced rate of relatively mild ARC endpoints. 6 participants had life-threatening adverse events that were judged to be possibly drug-related. Severe haematological and other adverse events on trial therapy were infrequent but significantly higher in the IMM group. Hamilton enrolled 338 mildly symptomatic people with CD4 counts between 200-500 in a Veterans Administration double-blind placebo-controlled study (VA 298) to determine if early treatment with AZT is superior to delayed treatment. Patients were initially randomised to receive AZT 1500 mg/day or placebo; all patients received AZT if the CD4 count fell below 200 during the trial. Overall mean follow-up times for the early and delayed-AZT groups were 27.2 and 28.2 months, respectively. In the early therapy group, 28/170 patients progressed to AIDS versus 48/168 in the delayed therapy group, confirming that early AZT treatment delays progression to AIDS. Early therapy increased the time until CD4 counts fell below 200 and it produced more conversions from positive to negative for serum p24 antigen. Early therapy was associated with more anaemia, leukopenia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, whereas late therapy was associated with more skin rash. 23/170 patients in the early treatment group and 20/168 in the delayed treatment group died. These results do not demonstrate any survival benefit with early treatment. Simberkoff reported that this conclusion remained unchanged after long-term follow-up to January 1992. Although VA 298 was not designed to observe racial differences in the effects of AZT, secondary sub-group analyses of the data from ACTG 016 and 019 conducted by Lagakos showed that progression rates were significantly higher for placebo recipients than for those receiving AZT among blacks, whites, Hispanics, non-Hispanics, men and non-IDUs. Among women and IDUs, progression rates were also higher among placebo recipients but these differences did not reach statistical significance, possibly because of the small number of events. An observational study by Easterbrook found that, after adjusting for disease stage at initiation of therapy, black, Hispanic and white people with AIDS and ARC receiving AZT had similar outcomes. Lange enrolled 335 asymptomatic patients with CD4 cell count below 400 or p24 antigenaemia in a placebo-controlled trial of AZT (500 mg twice a day). Median treatment period was 60 weeks, median follow-up was 98 weeks. Haematological toxicity was extremely low: 2% of AZT recipients developed anaemia and 3% neutropenia. The Kaplan-Meier probabilities of remaining free of AIDS or severe ARC at 18 months were 92% in the AZT group and 86% in the placebo group. At 108 weeks the difference was not statistically significant. AZT treatment appeared significantly to delay the onset of CDC group IV disease as defined by a review committee. CD4 cell counts remained above baseline significantly longer than those of the placebo group; CD4 counts were similar in the two groups at 108 weeks. At 108 weeks no survival benefit was seen in the AZT group. Graham analysed data from 2568 asymptomatic HIV-positive men, comparing the probabilities of death among those at similar stages of disease who began AZT therapy before the diagnosis of AIDS and among those who did not. There were 306 deaths. After controlling for CD4 count and symptoms, early use of AZT with or without PCP prophylaxis significantly reduced mortality among people with CD4 cell counts less than 350 in all follow-up periods. The relative risks of death were 0.43 at 6 months, 0.54 at 12 months, 0.59 at 18 months and 0.67 at 24 months. After adjusting for the effects of PCP prophylaxis, AZT alone significantly reduced mortality at 6, 12 and 18 months, but not at 24 months. Among AZT users, those who also used PCP prophylaxis before the development of AIDS had significantly lower mortality at 18 and 24 months than those who did not, suggesting that both antiviral and anti-PCP prophylaxis are necessary to maximise the survival benefit. Nonsignificant trends toward lower risk of developing AIDS were observed in participants who began AZT with CD4 counts above 350. Saah reported a retrospective analysis of factors influencing survival after diagnosis of AIDS among 2168 men enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Those who began anti-retroviral therapy within 3 months after diagnosis of AIDS had longer median survival (1.75 years) from that point than those who began treatment prior to AIDS (1.18 years). Merigan conducted a placebo-controlled trial of AZT (1200 mg/day) for asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects with haemophilia (ACTG 036). From February 1988 to August 1989, 193 subjects with CD4 cell counts below 500 were randomised. The placebo arm of the study was terminated after the results of ACTG 019 were reported (see above). All subjects in the haemophilia study were then offered open label AZT 500 mg/day and the study was closed to accrual. Mean follow-up was 9.6 months. In the subgroup of 89 haemophiliacs over 30 years old receiving AZT, significantly fewer progressed to AIDS or died (6 events) than those receiving placebo (11 events). For the haemophiliacs in the study under 30 years old, there was no statistical difference between the AZT group (7 events) and placebo group (10 events). Ragni studied the effect of AZT therapy in a cohort of 84 HIV-infected haemophiliacs whose seroconversion dates were known. The time to AIDS diagnosis was significantly longer for those treated with AZT before AIDS was diagnosed, with AIDS developing in 11/39 (28%) treated with AZT and 27/45 (60%) of those untreated. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for the time by which AIDS developed in 25% was 8.2 years after seroconversion in AZT-treated patients, compared with 4.5 years in untreated patients. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median survival time after diagnosis of AIDS for those never treated with AZT as compared with those treated either before or after AIDS was diagnosed was 0.5, 2.8 and 2.1 years respectively. There was little difference in the rate of fall in CD4 counts between AZT-treated and untreated groups, indicating that clinical advantages are not strongly related to the rate of decline in CD4 counts. Cooper enrolled 994 HIV asymptomatic people with CD4 count above 400 in an international study, comparing AZT (500 mg twice daily) or placebo. When the study began in December 1988, the only endpoint specified in the protocol was progression to symptomatic disease. In December, 1989, a CD4 count below 200 was added as an endpoint and in October, 1990, a CD4 count below 350 was also added. After 27 months follow-up, 16% of the AZT group reached an endpoint compared to 28% receiving placebo. Analysis of just the progressions to clinical HIV disease showed that 13% of placebo recipients progressed compared to 7% of AZT recipients. 25% of the placebo group progressed to CD4 count below 350, compared to 15% of the AZT group. For individuals with CD4 count of 400-500 on enrolment, overall progression rates were 20% versus 38% in the AZT and placebo groups respectively; for patients with initial CD4 counts between 500 and 750, the difference was 9% versus 18%. The most common adverse events in AZT recipients were nausea (12%) and headache (6%). Mulder enrolled 329 asymptomatic people at high risk of progression to AIDS (CD4 count between 200-400, or CD4 count above 400 and p24 antigenaemic) in EACG 017, a placebo-controlled study of AZT (500 mg twice daily). Median treatment duration was 57 weeks for the placebo group and 60 weeks for the AZT recipients. After two years of follow-up, no statistically significant difference in progression to severe ARC or AIDS was observed (17 progressions in the placebo group, 12 in the AZT group). However, at 1 year the probability of progression was 3% for the AZT group vs 11% for placebo recipients. At 12 and 18 months progression to symptomatic HIV disease was significantly delayed in the AZT-treated group. AZT recipients maintained CD4 counts at or above baseline levels for longer than placebo recipients, p24 antigen levels decreased in the AZT group and did not return to pretreatment levels by week 36. Severe toxicities were not seen. Cohen reported that lymph node biopsies taken at baseline and after 8 weeks from a cohort of 32 HIV-positive asymptomatic people with CD4 counts above 250 (mean baseline CD4 count 654) showed no statistically significant impact of antiretroviral therapy on viral replication in the lymph nodes in any of four groups: those with no prior AZT who initiated AZT; those with no prior therapy who remained untreated; those with prior AZT who continued AZT; those with prior AZT who added ddl. Primary infection Tindall reported that in comparison with historical controls, 7 men with primary HIV infection who received AZT (1 g/day) for a median of 56 days within 10 days of seroconversion symptoms had a significantly lower lymphocyte count and lower percentage and absolute number of CD8 cells than controls. The researchers speculated that AZT lessened the normal CD8 response, which might hinder the clearance of syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV strains. Kinloch enrolled 77 people with primary HIV infection, 94% of whom had experienced acute seroconversion illness, in a placebo-controlled trial of AZT (500 mg/day). After 6 months, 32% of placebo recipients had experienced a CD4 decrease to below 350, compared with 4% of AZT recipients. No AZT recipients developed early HIV-related symptoms such as oral candida, oral hairy leucoplakia or herpes simplex, compared with 5 episodes in the placebo group. 1 16 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 117](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/123?q1=directories) Children In May 1990 AZT was approved (in a syrup formulation) for use in HIV-infected children over three months old. The recommended dose for children is currently 180 mg/m2 given orally every six hours. Brady reported the results of ACTG 128, a trial comparing the standard dose of 180 mg/m2 with a reduced dose of 90 mg/m2 every 6 hours in 425 symptomatic HIV-positive children. After 3 years follow-up, there was no difference between the groups in the time to AIDS, the proportion who developed AIDS, CD4 counts or survival. There was no difference in neurodevelopmental status between the two groups. No significant difference in the number or severity of side-effects was observed. The researchers conclude that a lower dose of AZT should be used in paediatric HIV infection. McKinney examined the safety, tolerance and therapeutic response to AZT in 88 children with advanced HIV disease. Children who completed a 24 week out-patient trial of AZT (180 mg/m2 every 6 hours) treatment were permitted to continue receiving AZT. 61/88 children completed the initial 24-week trial and 49 continued to receive AZT for up to 90 weeks. AZT was generally well-tolerated. One or more episodes of haematologic toxicity occurred in 54 children (61%) - anaemia in 23 children (26%) and neutropenia in 42 (48%). Many of these abnormalities resolved spontaneously, but 30 children required transfusions or dose modification. 3 children had to stop receiving the drug because of haematologic toxicity. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the probability of survival was 0.89 after 24 weeks and 0.79 after 52 weeks. There was marked improvement in weight gain, cognitive function (mainly in children less than 3 years old), serum and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of p24 antigen and the proportion of cerebrospinal fluid cultures negative for HIV. CD4 counts (baseline mean was 263) improved during the first 12 weeks, although the improvement was not sustained through the 24th week. Pizzo gave AZT (0.5, 0.9, 1.4 or 1.8 mg/kg/hour) by continuous intravenous infusion to 21 symptomatic children aged froml4 months to 12 years who had acquired HIV infection through transfusions or perinatally. 13 (62%) had evidence of neuropsychological abnormalities. 14 developed anaemia requiring transfusion. Dose-limiting neutropenia occurred in most patients who received doses of 1.4 mg/kg/hr or more. Improvement in neurodevelopmental abnormalities occurred in all 13 children who had presented with encephalopathy before treatment. Serial measurements of IQ before therapy and after three and six months of treatment showed that IQ scores, including those for verbal and performance IQ, rose in these 13 patients and in 5 other children who had no detectable evidence of encephalopathy before treatment. Most patients also had increased appetite and weight, decreased lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, decreased immunoglobulin levels, and increased numbers of CD4 cells. In some patients the improvement in the features of encephalopathy occurred despite the absence of immunologic improvement. Brouwers assessed neuropsychologic function in 13 children with symptomatic HIV disease ranging in age from 14 months to 12 years. Before the initiation of treatment, eight patients were classified as having encephalopathy. Psychologic tests were administered both before and after 6 and 12 months of continuous-infusion AZT treatment. After 6 months of treatment a significant increase of 15.5 (+/- 3.3) IQ points was demonstrated in general cognitive functioning. Follow-up for 10 of these patients indicated that after 12 months of AZT therapy, they had maintained their gains in IQ points. Improvements in adaptive behavior after 6 months of therapy, assessed with a standardized interview, paralleled the findings on the IQ data. Perinatal transmission Connor randomized 477 pregnant women with CD4 counts above 200 to receive AZT or placebo after the 14th week of gestation (study ACTG 076). AZT was delivered orally at a dose of 500 mg/day until labour, and intravenously during labour. At birth, infants received AZT syrup (2 mg/kg four times daily) or placebo for six weeks according to the mother's randomization. During the study 409 women gave birth to 415 live-born infants. HIV-infection status was known for 363 births (180 in the AZT group and 183 in the placebo group). 13 infants in the AZT group and 40 in the placebo group were HIV-infected. The proportions infected at 18 months, as estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, were 8.3% in the AZT group and 25.5% in the placebo group. Minimal short-term toxic effects were observed. the level of haemoglobin at birth in infants in the AZT group was significantly lower than that in the infants in the placebo group. By 12 weeks of age, haemoglobin values inthe two groups were similar. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations on the basis of this study. They advise that pregnant HIV-infected women with CD4 counts above 200 who are at 14-34 weeks of gestation and who have no clinical indications for AZT and no history of more than 6 months prior antiretroviral therapy should recommended to follow the full ACTG 076 treatment protocol as described above. This protocol should also be recommended to women who are at more than 34 weeks of gestation, but with advice that the late initiation of treatment may reduce its efficacy. Pregnant women with CD4 counts below 200 should be recommended to follow the protocol as much for their own health benefit as to reduce the risk of transmission. Health-care providers should also consider offering the ACTG 076 protocol to women who have had more than 6 months prior AZT or other antiretroviral therapy before pregnancy. Women in labour who have not received the antepartum component of the ACTG 076 treatment protocol should be offered the intrapartum and neonatal components when the clinical situation permits. Infants born to HIV-positive women who have received no intrapartum AZT therapy should be offered the postpartum component if AZT can be initiated within 24 hours of birth. No data support the initiation of therapy later than this. Boyer reported on a cohort of 63 HIV-positive women who gave birth to 68 infants, 13 of whom were also infected with HIV. Mothers who experienced events which exposed their foetus to the mothers blood were more likely to transmit HIV (4/13 (31 %) versus 3/555 (5%)), as were women with p24 antigenaemia at delivery (6/9 (67%) versus 11/44 (25%)). AZT treatment during pregnancy and/or delivery was also associated with a reduced risk of transmission (1/26 (4%) versus 12/42 (29%), even in women with low CD4 counts. All infants were normal at birth and over 12-40 months of follow-up. Resistance A number of investigators have reported the isolation of AZT-resistant HIV strains from patients treated with AZT for longer than 6 months. Richman analysed isolates from 31 patients receiving AZT and found patients with late-stage HIV disease (defined as ARC or AIDS) developed resistance significantly sooner after starting AZT than those with early-stage disease. At one year of therapy, approximately 89% of late-stage patients developed resistance compared with 31% of early-stage patients. This is consistent with the example of the relation between drug resistance and level of immunosuppression provided by acyclovir-resistant HSV: despite several years of continuous acyclovir therapy for the suppression of recurrent mucocutaneous HSV, reports of acyclovir resistance have not been confirmed among immunocompetent people, but resistance is now commonplace among severely immunocompromised patients, including patients with advanced HIV disease. These results suggest that although disease stage may affect the emergence of AZT-resistant strains of HIV, a significant degree of resistance occurs even in patients with early stage of disease. The clinical relevance of this in vitro resistance is still unclear. D'Aquila reported that the development of high-level AZT resistance was the most significant predictor of poor prognosis among participants in ACTG 116B/117. The adjusted relative risks for progression in patients with high-level resistance at baseline were 2.6 for high-level AZT resistance, 1.8 for SI phenotype strains of HIV, 0.7 for log CD4, 1.5 for diagnosis of AIDS at entry and 0.6 for ddl treatment as opposed to continued AZT. Tudor-Williams studied the correlation between in vitro sensitivity to AZT and clinical outcome in 23 children with symptomatic HIV disease during extended monotherapy with AZT (ACTG 152). An in vitro assay was used to determine the concentration of AZT required to inhibit by 50% the replication of viral isolates (IC50) obtained after 9-39 months of treatment. Of 19 children with high enough viral titres for evaluation, 9 were stable, 7 deteriorated and 3 died during the first 6 months. There was a highly significant relation between decreased AZT susceptibility and poor clinical outcome but no relation between ICso and age at the start of therapy or length of time on treatment. Age-adjusted CD4 cell counts were significantly lower at the start of the treatment and the time of sampling in children whose viral isolates had an increased IC50. Initial serum p24 antigen levels were not predictive of subsequent emergence of resistant virus, but at the time of sampling for viral sensitivity higher p24 antigen levels were significantly associated with raised ICso. Tremblay reported that AZT-resistant strains of HIV-1 are around 100 times less infectious, but more cytopathic, than drug-sensitive strains isolated from the same individuals before initiation of drug therapy. Mayer reported a drug-susceptibility study of HIV isolates from 128 people at all stages of HIV infection who had received AZT monotherapy for at least 1 5 months. Viral isolates that had lost sensitivity to AZT were found also to be significantly less susceptible to ddl and ddC. For each 10-fold decrease in AZT susceptibility, ddC susceptibility decreased a mean of 2-fold and ddl susceptibility decreased a mean of 2.2-fold. The mechanism for AZT resistance is the emergence of one or more HIV strains with altered reverse transcriptase genes. Single nucleotide substitutions at codons 41,67, 70, 215 and 219 within the reverse transcriptase gene have been shown to confer AZT resistance. In order for high level resistance to occur, four of these point mutations must occur simultaneously. Several laboratories have reported cross-resistance among reverse transcriptase inhibitors. In vitro cross-resistance has been reported between AZT and ddl, ddC and AZdU, but not stavudine or foscarnet. Combination antiviral therapy may decrease the emergence of drug-resistant HIV. St Clair (1991) isolated HIV strains from sequential samples taken from 5 patients with advanced HIV disease who had been treated with AZT for at least 12 months but had changed to ddl treatment when they began to deteriorate clinically. HIV isolates recovered from PBMCs by co-cultivation with donor A-Z OF TREATMENTS 117 [Page 118](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/124?q1=directories) PBMCs all initially had reduced sensitivity to AZT. Within 6-12 months of discontinuing AZT, the isolates had become substantially more sensitive to AZT, while also developing a 6-26 fold decrease in sensitivity to ddl. The mechanism of resistance to ddl appeared to be a mutation in codon 74 in the reverse transcriptase coding region, which counteracted the effect of the most commonly seen AZT resistance-conferring mutation, at codon 215. A mutation at codon 181 is known to be selected by a number of the non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Combinations of this mutation with AZT-resistance conferring mutations at codon 215 or 41 plus 215 caused AZT-sensitivity to return to near wild-type levels. Schipper reported that after discontinuation of AZT therapy a gradual change from resistant to wild type, sensitive virus is observed in some, but not all, patients. Cox reported that combinations of AZT plus FLT, AZT plus ddl and FLT plus ddl had a synergistic inhibitory effect on AZT-sensitive HIV strains. However, after AZT-resistant strains had developed, AZT no longer showed synergy but addition or antagonism in combination with other drugs, whereas the synergistic response to the combination of FLT plus ddl was preserved. This finding suggests that combinations using AZT should be used relatively early, before AZT-resistant strains develop and thereafter combinations not involving AZT may offer advantages over continued mono- or combination therapy involving AZT. St Clair (1993) studied clinical data and stored viral isolates from 17 people who had developed AIDS or sustained a CD4 count below 200 after at least 6 months treatment with AZT, with controls matched for pre-treatment CD4 count and duration of therapy. Progressors had significantly higher levels of resistance to AZT than the controls. All 17 progressors had SI phenotype, but only 1 of the controls. Erice reported a case of primary infection with AZT-resistant HIV-1, according to both phenotypic and genotypic analyses. Masquelier reported the probable transmission of AZT-resistant HIV from mother to baby. Wainberg reported the first isolation of AZT-resistant HIV variants from the genital fluids of 4/5 patients who had received 16-22 months AZT therapy. Hermans found no evidence that 3 people infected with AZT-resistant strains had a different immune response or that the strains were more virulent and suggested that transmission of such strains could be more common than was previously thought. Toxicities Arnaudo reported that AZT recipients with myopathy (characterised by distinctive 'ragged-red' fibres on biopsy) had severely depleted mitochondrial DNA in muscle biopsy specimens, which may be reversible on discontinuation of AZT. Results of studies in rats and mice administered high doses of AZT indicate that AZT has a cancer-causing effect (vaginal neoplasms) in some rodent species. However, these results do not establish that AZT causes cancer in humans. Pluda found that 8/55 patients with AIDS or severe ARC developed a high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of B-cell type, a median of 23.8 months after starting antiretroviral treatment with AZT or regimens containing AZT. The Kaplan-Meier estimated probability of developing lymphoma by 30 months of therapy was 28.6% and by 36 months, 46.4%. Prolonged survival in the setting of profound immunosuppression with substantial CD4 cell depletion is probably an important factor in the development of these lymphomas. Although a direct role of AZT therapy in the development of NHL cannot be totally discounted, it now seems unlikely. For more details see the entry on Lymphoma. Sperling conducted a short-term retrospective study relating to 43 HIV-positive pregnant women (5 with AIDS, 21 with ARC, 12 csymptomatic, 3 data unavailable; CD4 count ranging from 8-870) who planned to continue with their pregnancies and had, or currently were receiving AZT at doses ranging between 300 and 1200 mg/day. 24 had taken AZT for at least 2 trimesters. 28 received concomitant medication, including PCP prophylaxis. AZT was well-tolerated, with only 2 dose reductions due to adverse effects. All 45 infants were delivered alive. No teratogenic abnormalities occurred in the 12 infants who were exposed to AZT during the first trimester. Five birth defects were noted: albinism; polydactyly in a child with a family history of this condition; clitoral enlargement; obstruction of the left ureteropelvic junction; and asymptomatic ventricular septal defect. All but 3 deliveries occurred at or after 36 weeks of gestation. The remaining three (including one set of twins) were born at 28, 33 and 28 weeks' gestation. Mean birth weight of the 38 singleton infants born at term was 3287 g - not significantly different from normal. 2 cases of intrauterine growth retardation were reported among infants delivered at term. 7/31 infants had haemoglobin levels below 8.4 mmol/l, including only 1/10 infants exposed to AZT throughout pregnancy. One case each of thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia were seen. Enlarged fatty liver and lactic acidosis have been reported and may be infrequent adverse reactions to AZT therapy. Freiman and Schuman reported enlarged fatty liver has been reported in 11 people receiving AZT; the syndrome was fatal in 8 of these individuals. Ten of the patients were women, and seven of these women were obese. Chattha reported 7 cases of lactic acidosis in HIV-infected patients, four of whom were receiving AZT. Other causes of lactic acidosis were excluded. Four patients died of cardiovascular collapse secondary to lactic acidosis. Two of the seven were obese women who were found to have extensive fatty liver. Wellcome suggests that obese women and patients with risk factors for liver disease be followed closely while receiving AZT, and that lactic acidosis be considered when patients develop tachypnea, dyspnea, or decreased bicarbonate levels.

SBCH-189 Like AZT, ddC and ddl, BCH-189 is a modified form of one of the building blocks of DNA (known as nucleosides). When HIV replicates in the presence of these nucleoside analogue drugs, the virus' reverse transcriptase enzyme incorporates the drug in the place of a normal nucleoside in the growing DNA strand. This prevents the proper assembly of viral genetic material and halts viral replication. Current use BCH-189 is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Early laboratory research has suggested that it may have less anti-HIV activity than AZT. Preliminary tests in people are underway in North America. The drug is not available in Britain. A-Z OF TREATMENTS 119 [Page 120](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/126?q1=directories) Key research Soudeyns demonstrated the ability of BCH-189 to suppress HIV replication in MT-4 T cells against 5 different strains of HIV-1 in a dose-dependent manner (mean ICso 0.73 pM). Lisignoli reported on the in vitro effects of BCH-189 compared with AZT on the immune function of lymphocytes from 10 uninfected and 12 HIV-positive people (CDC II and III). The effect of different doses of BCH-189 and AZT was analysed in vitro on: (i) T cell proliferation after stimulation; (ii) B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin production after stimulation; (iii) cytokine production from stimulated lymphocytes. BCH-189 inhibited the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes from infected and uninfected people less than AZT; even if lymphocytes from HIV-positive (CDC III) people produced higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, neither BCH-189 nor AZT interfered with cytokine release. Immunoglobulin production from B lymphocytes was inhibited only by a high concentration (50 pM) of BCH-189 or AZT. Phase 1/11 pharmacokinetic and safety studies in people with advanced ARC and AIDS are under way in Canada and the USA. References Lisignoli G et al.

It is one of three classes of interferon (the others are alpha interferon and gamma interferon). Artificial (recombinant) beta interferon is produced by genetically engineered bacteria. Current use Beta interferon is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Test-tube studies have shown that beta interferon has anti-HIV effects and the combination of beta interferon plus AZT is synergistic. However, clinical trials to date have found no evidence of any antiviral benefits from beta interferon treatment. It has also been used experimentally to treat advanced KS, with little success. Beta interferon is given by injection. Possible side-effects include fever, headache, chills, pain in the joints (arthralgia) or muscles (myalgia), dizziness, sweating, nausea, fatigue, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pain at injection site, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, vomiting, elevation of serum liver enzyme levels, transient sight disturbances, seizures, confusion and formation of antibodies to interferon. Key research In vitro studies have shown that beta-IFN stimulates NK cell cytotoxicity and enhances antigen expression. Hartshorn and Yamamoto reported that beta interferon inhibits HIV. Michaelis reported that interferon beta protects infected PBMC cultures from virus-mediated cytopathology and killing and inhibits HIV replication as measured by reverse transcriptase activity. Miles studied the efficacy of high doses (90 million or 180 million international units/day) of beta interferon in a sequential sample of 39 people with biopsy-proven Kaposi's sarcoma. Treatment was well-tolerated with the major toxicities being local reaction at the injection site and flu-like symptoms. KS tumour response was minimal. However, there was evidence of anti-HIV effects; in 8/19 people with HIV p24 antigen levels of more than 50 pg/mL at entry the level decreased by more than 50% with treatment, although changes were transient. Oka reported that four weeks' treatment with beta interferon did not affect the number of HIV proviruses in the blood of 11 treated people in a clinical trial as measured by quantitative PCR. An interim analysis was conducted by the sponsor on a multicentre phase III double-blind placebo-controlled trial of beta interferon for people with ARC or AIDS and CD4 counts below 200. No improvements in immunological and virological parameters or clinical events were reported. Due to disease progression, local skin reactions and/or systematic symptoms (fevers, malaise) and the availability of other agents through competing protocols, approximately 30% of the subjects have withdrawn from the study.

The bitter melon plant is common in Asia and parts of the USA and is known by a range of different names such as ampalaya, balsam pear, cindeamor, margose, concombre, Kuguazi (in China) and Karela (in Pakistan). Its fruits, seeds, leaves, flowers, stems and roots have been used for centuries in Chinese medicine. The plant has long been used as a diabetes treatment. Juice from the leaves and fruit has anti-bacterial and anti-parasitic properties, and the leaves, fruit and seeds all contain chemicals which can induce abortion. A chemical which inhibits the replication of viruses, including the herpes simplex virus, has been identified. However, not all the research into bitter melon has been positive. One study suggested that the plant extracts might in fact be immunosuppressive. Researchers have found that bitter melon contains several proteins that can inhibit HIV in the test-tube. These proteins, known collectively as ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are alpha-momarchorin, beta-momarchorin and MAP-30 (Momordica Anti-HIV Protein). Current use Bitter melon is an unlicensed, experimental treatment. There have no yet been any controlled studies that could establish whether or not it is an effective treatment. In the absence of hard facts, there are many anecdotal accounts of people with HIV who claim to have had remarkable improvements in CD4 count, diarrhoea and dermatitis and to have gained weight. However, other people report no benefits from the treatment. Side-effects seem to be limited to diarrhoea and fevers. Taking it Bitter melon is sold by many Asian grocery stores and is sometimes available frozen. There are several different ways of administering it, including chopping and blending the plant with water or boiling it to produce a liquid which is then either drunk or used as a retention enema (in which the liquid is held in the bowel until it is all absorbed). The 120 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 121](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/127?q1=directories) suggested amount of drink or enema is a total of 12-16 ounces per day. Current developments Japanese researchers have produced an artificial version of MAP 30 using recombinant techniques. The recombinnat protein retains the anti-HIV effects of the natural product inthe test-tube and has only minor toxic effects on cells and laboratory animals. Key research Lee-Huang (1993) reported that MAP 30 exhibits potent activity against HIV-1 in both acutely and chronically infected cells in vitro and inhibits the function of eukaryotic ribosomal RNA in messenger RNA translation. It can also relax and decatentate supercoiled DNA and catalyze double-stranded breakage of DNA. Zhang prepared an extract of Mormodica charantia from decoction and administered it daily via oral and/or rectal routes to 6 people with HIV. Significant increases in CD4 count were reported. Lee-Huang (1994) produced a recombinant form of MAP 30. This retained the antiviral activity of the native protein when tested in acutely and chronically infected cells, by syncytium formation in CEM-ss cells, by p24 expression and by HIV reverse transcriptase activity in H9 cells.

SBleomycin Bleomycin is an approved anti-cancer drug which appears to work by fragmenting DNA. It is active, alone or in combination, against a wide spectrum of tumours. It is given by intravenous or intramuscular injection. In AIDS research it is being tested as a treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoma. The most serious potential side effect is pulmonary (lung) toxicity, which is a particular risk in elderly people or those who receive cumulative doses higher than 300 units. The most frequent side-effects are skin discolouration and inflammation of mucous membranes. There is also a risk of a flu-like allergic reaction that causes fever and chills a fewer hours after injection, but this can be prevented by an injection of corticosteroids at the same time as the bleomycin. Bleomycin is manufactured by Lundbeck. In the US it is also known by the tradename Blenoxane. * Butyl DNJ Butyl DNJ is a drug artificially derived from plant sugars. In the test-tube it disrupts the normal formation of the complex sugars which make up HIV's outer (envelope) protein called gpl 20. This prevents the virus from binding onto the CD4 molecule on human cells and infecting them. Butyl DNJ stands for N-butyl deoxynojirmycin. The drug is sometimes referred to as deoxynojirmycin, BuDNJ or by the codename SC-48334. It is manufactured by the drug company G D Searle & Co. Current use Butyl DNJ is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Clinical trials have found no clear evidence that it is effective, and the company is not expected to pursue its development. Reported side-effects are mainly gastro-intestinal such as cramping, bloating and diarrhoea. These side-effects seem to be less common in people with early ARC than in people with more advanced disease. In animals butyl DNJ also caused liver problems, decreased platelet counts and eye cataracts, but none of these have yet been observed in humans. Current developments Researchers have developed a pro-drug of butyl-DNJ i.e. a substance that is broken down into butyl DNJ within the body. This pro-drug, known by the codename SC-49483, seems to cause fewer gastrointestinal side-effects. A study comparing two different doses of SC-49483 plus AZT with AZT alone is underway in the USA. Key research In vitro, butyl-DNJ inhibits protein N-glycosylation, which Montefiori reports as being essential to the ability of HIV to infect healthy cells. Glycosylation inhibitors prevent post translational changes in gpl 20 and hence inhibit viral binding. Karpas reported that butyl-DNJ was the most effective aminosugar inhibitor of HIV in in vitro tests. Gruters has reported decreased infectivity of HIV as well as inhibition of cell fusion in the presence of butyl-DNJ. Ratner reported that in vitro the combination of butyl-DNJ plus ddl, ddC or AZT reduced reverse transcriptase activity more than any single agent and the effects on the number of infectious virus particles were additive or synergistic. Tierney conducted a phase I tolerability and pharmacokinetics study of Butyl-DNJ among people with advanced HIV disease. The major toxicity was diarrhoea. Fischl enrolled 118 people with CD4 counts between 200-500 and less than 12 weeks prior AZT therapy in a phase II double-blind randomised study comparing AZT monotherapy with the combination of AZT plus Butyl-DNJ (1000 mg every 8 hours) for 24 weeks. No significant difference in change in CD4 count or virological markers between the two groups was observed. However, there was a trend for combination recipients to experience a greater decline in detectable levels of serum p24 antigen. In participants with prior AZT experience, those receiving the combination had CD4 count increases during the first 8 weeks of treatment, compared with declines in CD4 count among AZT monotherapy recipients. Smith reported that SC-49483, a pro-drug of Butyl-DNJ, was significantly less likely to cause loose or watery stool than Butyl-DNJ itself. References Fischl MA et al.

Data from pharmacokinetic studies in HIV-negative volunteers suggest that concentrations high enough to inhibit VZV can be achieved with once daily dosing. A clinical trial is under way comparing BW882C87 to acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster. BW882C87 is being developed by Wellcome. * Capreomycin Capreomycin is an approved, intramuscularly injected antibiotic that is active against certain strains of TB. It is used in combination with other anti-TB drugs. Side-effects can include allergic reactions such as rash, shortage of white blood cells, abnormalities in liver function tests, kidney toxicity, hearing loss with tinnitus (whistling noises) and vertigo. It is manufactured by Dista under the tradename Capastat. * Capsaicin Capsaicin is an approved cream used for the temporary relief of pain in cases ranging from peripheral neuropathy to herpes zoster. It is a naturally occurring substance obtained from the Solanaceae plant family; it interrupts the transmission of pain impulses from the affected place to the brain. Side-effects can include mild burning sensations during the first few days of use. It is manufactured by Euroderma under the tradename Axsain or, in the USA, Zostrix. * Carbamazepine Carbamazepine is a commonly used anti-convulsant drug used for treating seizures such as epilepsy and manic-depression. It is related chemically to tricyclic antidepressants, and comes in tablet-form. Carbamazepine can be used to reduce the pain associated with peripheral neuropathy. Side-effects include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, confusion, double vision, rash, constipation, nausea and vomiting. * Castanospermine Castanospermine is a substance derived from the Australian chestnut or black ban tree (Castanospermum australe), a tree which is on the verge of extinction. In 1992 British researchers found that the substance could also be extracted from daisy leaves. In the test-tube, castanospermine inhibits the production of HIV's envelope protein gpl 20. Virus particles that are produced in the presence of castanospermine are unable to bind onto the CD4 receptor on human cells. Several synthetic versions of castanospermine have been produced for study, the most promising of which is called Bucast and is also sometimes referred to as B-Cast, MDL 28,574A or its chemical name 6-0-butaoylcastanospermine. Current use Castanospermine is an unlicensed, experimental drug. In tests with mice castanospermine appeared to be more toxic than AZT. It inhibited gut enzymes, making it harder for the mice to digest complex carbohydrates such as rice and bread and resulting in weight loss and lethargy. It also caused thrombocytopenia. One set of researchers found that the drug did inhibit mouse retroviruses while another group found little evidence of antiviral effects. Bucast has been shown to be 60 times more active against HIV than castanospermine in vitro. Key research Ruprecht reported that in mice castanospermine caused weight loss, lethargy and thrombocytopenia but had antiretroviral effects. Hollingshead reported that although castanospermine reduced splenomegaly in mice infected with Rauscher murine leukaemia virus it did not lower viral titres. Sunkara reported that bucast inhibited syncytium formation by HIV-1 in vitro. No host cell toxicity was observed at concentrations up to 200 g/mL, and no toxicity was observed when the compound was administered to mice for 2 weeks at 200 mg/kg/day. Taylor reported that in vitro bucast was at least 50 times more active than Butyl-DNJ and less active but better tolerated in cell culture than ddC. References Hollingshead MG et al.

SCD4 CD4 is a receptor on the surface of T-helper cells which HIV binds onto in order to gain entry into the cell. An artificial (or recombinant) version of CD4 (called rCD4) has been manufactured. To make rCD4 stay in the body longer an alternative molecule consisting of rCD4 and antibody has been prepared: rCD4-lgG. The theory behind this treatment is that significant quantities of HIV in the blood will bind onto these artificial CD4 molecules rather than onto the real CD4 molecules on the surface of human cells. Essentially, the recombinant 122 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 123](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/129?q1=directories) molecule should act as a decoy, mopping up viruses in the bloodstream. Current use Recombinant CD4 and associated treatments such as rCD4-lgG are unlicensed, experimental drugs. They are not available in Britain. Recombinant CD4 has been shown to work in the test-tube against laboratory strains of HIV, but researchers found that very few 'wild' strains of HIV taken from infected people bound onto the recombinant molecule. Some researchers believe that the theory behind this treatment is fundamentally flawed because the body automatically produces antibodies against HIV's envelope protein gpl 20 which bind onto the virus just like recombinant CD4 is meant to, but these antibodies do not seem to affect the progress of the disease. Similarly, researchers have found that people with HIV naturally have soluble CD4 circulating in their blood stream at levels which remain high even in relatively advanced disease, suggesting that it has little or no effect on disease progression. Phase I trials in people, in which rCD4 was given by drip or injection, have found no evidence of immunological or antiviral effects. No significant side-effects from these CD4-based treatments have been reported. Use in combinations Test-tube studies suggest that the combination of AZT and rCD4 is synergistic against HIV in a wide range of cell lines, without harming uninfected cells. Current developments Researchers have developed a form of recombinant CD4 which is linked to a poison, Pneumonas ruginosa exotoxin A (PE40). The theory behind this treatment is that this molecule, known as rCD4-PE40, will bind onto and kill cells infected with HIV which have the virus' gpl 20 protein on their surface. This worked in laboratory tests and did not kill uninfected cells. Human trials are underway in the USA. The molecule is probably too big to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and act against HIV-infected cells in the central nervous system. Another strategy under investigation is the use of anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies. This is an artificial antibody which resembles an antibody to the CD4 receptor. The theory is that when it is injected into the body, the immune system will produce new antibodies against the monoclonal antibody. These new antibodies should closely resemble the CD4 receptor itself, and so may also bind onto HIV's gpl 20 protein and prevent the virus from binding to cells that carry the 'real' CD4 molecule. Key research Recombinant soluble CD4 (rCD4) molecules are soluble, secreted forms of CD4 receptor molecules which lack its transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions. rCD4-lgG are synthetic, antibody-like hybrids of rCD4 molecules attached to an immunoglobulin (IgG). CD4-lgG have retained key properties of both rCD4 and an immunoglobulin (IgG). They bind to the gpl 20 of laboratory strains of HIV and block infection of T cells and monocytes in vitro. The attached immunoglobulin (IgG) gives the molecule a longer serum half-life than soluble CD4 alone. CD4-PE40 is a recombinant protein produced by genetic engineering technology that contains the HIV binding region of human CD4 linked to the active domains of Pseudomonas ruginosa exotoxin A. In separate in vitro studies Deen, Fisher, Hussey, Smith and Traunecker reported that when tested against laboratory strains of HIV-1, rCD4 binds to the HIV envelope protein gpl 20 and thereby blocks viral infectivity, replication and HIV-virus induced cell fusion (syncytium or giant cell formation). Moore and Daar both reported that rCD4 and CD4-lgG were largely ineffective in vitro when tested against primary isolates of HIV (i.e. those freshly obtained from an HIV-infected individual) rather than laboratory strains such as HIV-IIIB. The investigators reported that this ineffectiveness resulted from low binding affinity between rCD4 and the gpl 20 from primary HIV isolates. The investigators further suggest that this low binding affinity may account for the lack of efficacy seen to date in clinical trials of rCD4 and CD4-lgG. However, in a separate study Ashkenazi found that the CD4-binding affinities of rgpl20 from strains with markedly different CD4 sensitivities were essentially the same and only small differences were observed in the kinetics of CD4 binding. These results suggest that the lower sensitivity of primary HIV-1 isolates to neutralization by CD4-based molecules is not due to lower binding affinity between soluble CD4 and free gp120. Callahan reported that the binding of soluble CD4 molecules to viral gp1 20 is reduced in the presence of anti-gpl 20 antibodies which compete with soluble CD4. Since anti-gpl20 antibodies occur in HIV infection in vivo and since the presence of these blocking antibodies does not seem to affect the development of disease, soluble CD4 seems unlikely to suppress HIV infection by simply blocking envelope binding. However it is possible that soluble CD4 has additional effects on virus neutralisation, even in the presence of blocking antibodies. It may be possible to overcome the blocking effects of anti-gpl 20 antibodies by using much higher concentrations of soluble CD4. Ward reported that pre-treatment with CD4-lgG protected chimpanzees from infection with HIV-1 IIIB. Chimpanzees received CD4-lgG 5 mg/kg intravenously 8 hours and 1 hour before inoculation with cell-free virus and then received CD4-lgG 2.5 mg/kg/day by intramuscular injection for 6 weeks. The investigators suggested that CD4-lgG may therefore effectively prevent perinatal HIV transmission. Schooley and Kahn enrolled a total of 60 people with AIDS and ARC in two phase 1/11 escalating-dose safety and pharmacokinetic trials of rCD4 (manufactured by Biogen and Genentech respectively). Participants received rCD4 doses ranging up to 300 mg/kg/day intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously for up to 11 weeks. No significant toxicities or side-effects were observed. No significant changes in CD4 or CD8 counts or p24 antigen levels were observed in either study. Johnson evaluated the interactions of soluble CD4 and AZT against HIV-1 replication in vitro in a variety of cell types. The combination inhibited HIV-1 synergistically over a broad range of drug concentrations and in all cell types tested without additive cytotoxicity. Husson conducted a phase 1 study to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of recombinant soluble CD4 (100, 300 and 1000 pg/kg/day by continuous IV infusion) in children with symptomatic HIV infection. After an initial 12 weeks of treatment with sCD4 alone, ddl (90 mg/m2 every 8 hours) was added. Combination therapy was continued in patients in whom it was well tolerated. During the 12 weeks of treatment with sCD4 alone and during subsequent sCD4 plus ddl combination therapy no significant toxic reaction attributable to sCD4 or ddl was observed. Low-level anti-CD4 antibodies developed in 2 participants. Steady-state sCD4 levels increased proportionately at higher doses. The CD4 cell counts and serum p24 antigen levels did not provide evidence of antiviral activity. Collier, Hodges and Davey (1991) enrolled a total of 57 people with AIDS and ARC with CD4 counts below 500 in three separate phase I escalating-dose safety and pharmacokinetic studies of rCD4-lgG. Participants received doses ranging up to 3,000 mg/kg/day intravenously and 6,000 mg/kg/day subcutaneously with and without AZT 500 mg/day. No significant toxicities were observed. No significant changes in CD4 count or p24 antigenemia were reported. Mulligan conducted a phase I trial of CD4-lgG in 6 HIV-positive individuals with documented in vitro sensitivity to CD4-lgG and CD4 counts between 50-200. There was no evidence of drug toxicity and no participants developed antibodies to CD4-lgG. CD4 counts, neopterin levels and beta2-microglobulin levels remained unchanged. Mean titre of infectious plasma virus was reduced by at least 5-fold in 2/6. 3/6 had a 25% reduction in p24 antigen levels. Shearer treated 6 HIV-infected pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy with rCD4-lgG (1 mg/kg by intravenous bolus) either at onset of labour, or 1 week prior to delivery and at onset of labour. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that the mean peak serum concentration of rCD4-lgG in pregnant women is 16.0 pg/mL and that rCD4-lgG crosses the placenta. There was no evidence of toxicity or immunologic or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities have been seen in mothers or infants. None of the infants has shown evidence of infection with HIV. In separate in vitro studies Ashorn, Chaudhary, Pitts and Rubino showed that CD4-PE40 selectively kills cells expressing gpl 20. It is inactive against cells latently infected with HIV and uninfected cells. The investigators note that the A-Z OF TREATMENTS 123 [Page 124](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/130?q1=directories) size of the CD4-PE40 molecule (60kD) may be too large to cross the blood-brain barrier. Till reported the coupling of CD4 with other toxins such as ricin. Davey (1992) conducted a phase I dose-ranging study of single intravenous bolus doses of intravenous CD4-PE40 (1, 5, 10, 15 or 45 pg/kg) in 24 HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts below 500 (mean CD4 count was 215). The half-life averaged 2 hours. Anti-PE40 antibodies developed in 12/24 within 3 weeks. Davey (1993) re-challenged 17 with monthly doses for 2 months, then weekly doses for 6 weeks. No relationship was found between prior formation of antibodies to PE40 and toxicity. The major toxicity consisted of transient elevations in hepatic transaminases characteristically peaking 48 hours after intravenous bolus infusion. No consistent beneficial or harmful effects on CD4 count, CD4 percent, serum p24 antigen, beta2-microglobulinaemia or plasma viraemia were observed at the doses tested. Van de Horst has enrolled 55 individuals with CD4 counts below 300 in a dose-ranging study (ACTG 201) of weekly CD4-PE40. The maximum tolerated dose appears to be about 320 pg/m per week. LFT elevations were the dose-limiting toxicity. After 8 weeks of treatment, no significant differences in CD4 counts, p24 antigen levels, plasma cultures or quantitative cell cultures were observed. No patients developed anti-CD4 antibodies. 50% developed neutralizing antibodies. Currently, the study is enrolling patients to determine the maximum tolerated dose of five-times-weekly administration. Wathen reported that in tests of sera from individuals treated with CD4-PE40, no antibodies to CD4 were detected, but 18/36 developed antibodies against the PE40 domain. Although most individuals developed neutralising antibodies, only 8/36 experienced 10-fold increases in neutralising titre over the course of a 10 week study. Sutor vaccinated 10 people with alum-precipitated anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies in a phase.I trial. The vaccine was well-tolerated. 8/10 recipients experienced an increase in CD4 count and an additional increase was observed in 6/6 who received a booster vaccination. Serum antibodies from 4 participants showed an augmented capability to inhibit gpl 20/CD4 interactions. References Ashkenazi A et al.

It is used in the treatment of several cancers including lymphoma. * Cidofovir Cidofovir is an experimental antiviral drug with broad-spectrum anti-herpesvirus activity in vivo. It comes either as a liquid for intravenous injection or as a cream. It is being studied as a treatment for CMV retinitis and the cream is being tested as a treatment for herpes simplex infections. Animal studies found that Cidovir caused side-effects in some species but not others. Guinea pigs and rabbits developed kidney toxicity, but there were no side-effects in rats and few in monkeys. No information on its side-effects in humans is yet available. 124 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 125](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/131?q1=directories) Cidofovir was formerly known as HPMPC or by the codename GS-0504. It is manufactured by Gilead Sciences Inc. SCimetidine Cimetidine is a drug designed to treat ulcers, but it has also demonstrated some potential to boost the immune system. It is an antihistamine drug that works in the stomach, reducing the levels of hydrochloric acid which can cause peptic ulcers by eroding the stomach lining. Histamine is a substance produced by white blood cells in the stomach as a regulator of acid secretion, or in response to an allergic reaction; antihistamine drugs are commonly used to treat allergies such as hayfever. However, many of the cells of the immune system also have receptors for histamine, which are important components in immune functioning. Cimetidine is able to attach to the histamine receptors on immune cells, theoretically blocking the ill effects that histamine may have on immune function. Cimetidine is available as a generic (non-branded) drug. It is also marketed under the tradenames Tagamet, Algitec and Dyspamet. Current use Although cimetidine is a licensed drug for reducing stomach acidity, its use as an anti-HIV immune modulating treatment is experimental. Only two published studies has focused on cimetidine as a treatment for HIV infection. The first, an uncontrolled trial in 33 people with ARC, showed increases in CD4 counts and improvements in both symptoms such as night sweats and diarrhoea and in skin tests used to measure the extent of immune functioning. In the other, in 8 patients with KS, only one person seemed to benefit. No side-effects were seen in either trial, but mild diarrhoea, dizziness, rashes, confusion, headaches and reversible liver damage have been reported by some people using cimetidine as an anti-ulcer treatment. Rarer side-effects include decreased blood counts, muscle or joint pain, slowed heartbeat and allergic sensitivity; occasional cases of kidney damage and pancreatitis have also been reported. There is also a risk that reducing the acidity of the stomach will increase the risk of getting infections such as Salmonella. Taking it Cimetidine is usually produced as tablets, although it can also be obtained as a suspension, a syrup, an injection or a form for intravenous infusion. Cimetidine reverses the normal acidity of the stomach which can affect how certain other drugs are absorbed. Drugs that require an acidic stomach such as dapsone or ketoconazole may not be absorbed properly, while the absorption of other drugs may be increased. In particular, cimetidine may increase ddl absorption, thus also increasing the risk of ddl side-effects such as pancreatitis. Ranitidine (tradename Zantac) is a closely related drug which is prescribed for the same conditions as cimetidine. One study found that it improved natural killer (NK) cell activity in people with HIV. The most common side-effect is headache. Getting it Doctors are able to prescribe cimetidine and ranitidine on the NHS for conditions where reduced stomach acidity is required. While they are not supposed to prescribe a drug for indications other than those for which it is licensed, some doctors may be willing to write prescriptions for people who wish to try the drugs as immune modulators. They are not available over-the-counter and are not currently in clinical trials in Britain. Key research Cimetidine is a substituted imidazole compound which is antagonist. the imidazole nucleus of cimetidine. They are commonly prescribed for the treatment of stomach ulcers, which they control by reducing the volume and concentration of gastric secretions. These drugs may have an immunomodulatory effect by virtue of their interaction with H2 receptors on cells in the immune system. Sahasrabudhe reported that cimetidine inhibits suppressor T cells in vitro. Brockmeyer administered 1200 mg of cimetidine daily to 33 people with ARC for 5 months. Therapy was interrupted after 3 months for a period of 3 weeks. All enrolled patients had lymphadenopathy or oral candida and CD4 counts below 400 and received no other therapy. After 3 months, the average CD4 count rose from 385 to 779. On discontinuation of cimetidine, average CD4 fell to 511, but rose to 693 after six weeks of resumed therapy. 74% of participants who had night sweats and 71% with diarrhoea reported complete remission of symptoms. Clinical improvements were also observed in gains in body weight and shrinking of enlarged lymph nodes. Smith treated 8 patients with KS with cimetidine (1200 mg/day increased to 2400 mg/day if no response was seen after 1 month). 1 patient had a complete remission lasting over 7 months and 1 had a mixed response with initial regression of lesions, followed by progressive disease. 5/8 had progressive disease within 2 months of beginning therapy. Subjective relief of genital herpes pain, dyspepsia and fever were reported. No toxicity was seen. Nielson conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ranitidine. 18 asymptomatic HIV-infected participants were randomized to receive ranitidine (600 mg/day) or placebo for 28 days. Natural killer cell activity improved significantly in the ranitidine group. There were no differences in CD4 cell counts after treatment. References Brockmeyer NH et al.

It is being tested in combination with other drugs for treating MAI. Ciprofloxacin is usually taken as tablets, although it can also be given in an intravenous form for treating urinary tract infections or gonorrhoea. It belongs to the 4-quinolone family of drugs, which have occasionally been reported to cause seizures in some people. Other side-effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache and rash.

SClarithromycin Clarithromycin is an approved antibiotic for use in combination with other drugs for the treatment of MAI. It is also approved for treating respiratory tract infections and mild-to-moderate skin and soft tissue infections. It belongs to the macrolide class of drugs. Clarithromycin is also being tested alone and in combination with other drugs for the treatment of toxoplasmosis; in laboratory studies it does show activity against Toxoplasma organisms. Its side-effects are mainly mild and short-lived gastro-intestinal upsets such as diarrhoea, nausea, abnormal taste, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and headache. Less than 5% of people experience these problems. Severe abdominal pain is more likely at high doses (above 2 g twice daily). Drug interactions It has some significant interactions with other drugs. It should not be taken at the same time as the antihistamine drugs astemizole or terfenadine as these combinations have been associated with heart irregularities. These antihistamines are marketed under the brandnames Hismanal, Seldane and Terfex. Taking clarithromycin decreases levels of AZT in the blood. Clarithromycin levels are reduced by greater than 50% if a person starts taking rifabutin after they have begun taking clarithromycin. However, no interaction is seen if clarithromycin is started after rifabutin. Clarithromycin is manufactured by Abbott under the tradename Klaricid. In the USA its tradename is Biaxin.

It is considered to be of limited usefulness because of its potentially serious side-effects, including pseudo-membranous colitis (which can be fatal), diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, jaundice and liver impairment, blood abnormalities and rash. It is available either in tablet form or as a liquid for intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion. It is usually used in combination with primaquine for PCP and in combination with pyrimethamine for toxoplasmosis. Clindamycin is manufactured by Upjohn under the tradename Dalacin C. * Clofazimine Clofazimine is an approved oral treatment for leprosy. It is being tested in combination with other drugs as a treatment for MAI. In test-tube studies it inhibits MAI organisms. The drug has been reported as causing pink-to-brownish-black skin discoloration in 75-100% of recipients. These changes are said to become obvious after a 6 month course of therapy with 100 mg/day for MAI. It has also been associated with eye disorders including keretopathy and retinal degeneration, nausea, giddiness, headaches, rash and, at high doses, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.

It is manufactured by Baypharm under the tradename Canestan, or is available in a generic (non-brandname) formulation. The cream is often used to treat mild fungal skin infections. The lozenge can be used as a treatment for oral candidiasis; side-effects can include stomach upsets and abnormally high levels of liver enzymes. The study ACTG 981, which enrolled 428 people, compared the effectiveness of fluconazole (200 mg/day) and clotrimazole (50 mg/day) as antifungal prophylaxis, and found fungal infections.

The exact mechanism of action against HIV is uncertain but it is reported to selectively inhibit viral replication and then kill infected cells in vitro. It is this latter effect which makes it different from other therapies. It actually eradicates infected cells, so there are theoretical grounds for hoping that it might clear HIV altogether (i.e. compound Q may be virucidal rather than merely virustatic). No other agents are yet known which might completely clear HIV from the body. Compound Q is sometimes referred to as GLQ223 or trichosanthin. Current use Compound Q is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Clinical trials are continuing in the USA. A trial on compound Q was completed by Byers and workers at Project Inform, a community based organisation in California. One major problem was that the drug had to be taken by injection. Project Inform was able to recruit a large number of participants and of these 6 patients developed dementia and one patient died as a result of this therapy. A simultaneous hospital study did not reveal such serious side-effects, but this may have been because of the smaller sample in the group. Neither study found any efficacy, however. Another study in 56 people with CD4 counts between 100 and 350 reported significant increases in total T-cell counts. A smaller trial reported some evidence of antiviral effects such as temporary reductions in p24 antigen levels and an increase in CD4 percentage. People treated with compound Q have commonly reported side-effects including headaches, muscle aches, rashes and flu-like symptoms. A few people have experience a form of allergic reaction during or soon after infusion which may be fatal unless promptly treated. Mental changes ranging from confusion to dementia have also been reported. These may be due to compound Q killing HIV-infected brain cells, or due to killed HIV-infected cells releasing toxins that affect other uninfected brain cells. Genelabs, who manufacture compound Q, consider that it is too risky for people with CD4 counts below 100. Use in combination A doctor who conducted a one-year study of the combination in 65 evaluable patients in his practice believes that the combination is synergistic; researchers at Genelabs, who manufacture the drug, believe that the combination shows at least additive benefits. A 148 person study in which people who had taken AZT for at least 9 months either remained on AZT, switched to compound Q or started taking it in combination with AZT found no difference between the study arms on an intention-to-treat analysis. A small study suggested that for people who had taken AZT or ddl for at least 1 year but were experienced disease progression, adding compound Q to their existing treatment stopped or reversed the decline in their CD4 cell counts over a 6 month period. Taking it Compound Q is produced as a liquid which is administered by intravenous infusion. Close medical supervision during infusions is essential as potentially fatal allergic reactions have been seen. Compound Q is not available in Britain. Current developments A non-toxic protein derived from trichosanthin, called TAP 29, has been reported to have anti-HIV activity at lower - and therefore safer - doses than compound Q. Key research McGrath reported that GLQ223 exerts a selective inhibitory effect that initially suppresses viral replication and ultimately selectively kills HIV-infected monocytes/macrophages. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Ferrari reported that GLQ223 inhibited syncytium formation between infected H9 cells and uninfected Sup-T1 cells from 0.5 to 4 pg/ml and also inhibited HIV replication in H9 and CEM-SS cells at 1 pg/ml, but was toxic for MT-4 cells (HTLV-1-positive), at doses greater than 0.25 pg/ml. Pulliam investigated the in vitro effect of trichosanthin on human brain cells and macrophages. Brain cells exposed to HIV-infected macrophages or trichosanthin-treated infected macrophages underwent morphological alterations, with the most severe damage observed in brain cells exposed to trichosanthin-treated HIV-infected macrophages. Brain cells exposed to trichosanthin alone, uninfected macrophages or trichosanthin-treated uninfected macrophages were not damaged. These results suggest that neurological complications observed in some HIV-infected people treated with trichosanthin may be due to the release or production of toxic factors from trichosanthin-killed HIV-infected macrophages. Kahn enrolled 18 (10 AIDS/8 ARC) subjects with CD4 cell count below 350 in a phase I safety and pharmacokinetics study of a single infusion of GLQ223 1,8, 16, 24, or 36 pg/kg intravenously. 14/18 subjects had prior treatment with AZT. At completion of the trial, no significant changes in immunological or virological parameters were noted. Toxicities included headaches (12/18), muscle aches (10/18) and flu-like symptoms (10/18); these symptoms were controlled within 24-72 hours by the use of paracetamol and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 1 patient receiving GLQ223 36 pg/kg developed a neurological reaction similar to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Although the patient was intubated and treated with systemic steroids, recovery was slow and incomplete. Gorelick (1992), Lifson and Kunz reported on a trial in which 56 people with AIDS or ARC (CD4 count 100-350) received 4 weekly infusions of 8, 16, 24, 36, or 50 pg/kg of GLQ223. Protocol amendments allowed patients to continue therapy and to undergo individual dose escalation up to 200 pg/kg. Some participants were treated for over a year and received as many as 34 infusions. PK evaluation showed target blood levels and duration of exposure were achieved only in those receiving 36 or 50 pg/kg. Statistically significant increases in total T cell count and beta2-microglobulin levels were observed. 9 participants discontinued due to an adverse event (including one anaphylactoid reaction), most during the first 4 infusions. Almost all patients experienced a transient flu-like syndrome characterized characterized primarily by rash, pruritus and rare hypotension were observed, but patients were generally able to continue to receive GLQ223. Frequency of development of antibodies to GLQ223 as well as time to development of antibodies was related to the dose administered. Overall, 63% developed antibodies, with 90% of patients receiving 50 pg/kg becoming antibody positive within 4 weeks. Development of IgG antibodies to GLQ223 appeared to be temporally associated with reduction in side-effects, without evidence of new toxicities. In contrast, changes in levels of selected surrogate markers (e.g. increased CD4 cell count) continued to be observed in the presence of anti-GLQ223 antibodies. Byers (1990) evaluated 51 people with CD4 cell count below 400 who received 1-3 infusions of a trichosanthin preparation in varying doses (10-30 pg/kg), routes of administration (intramuscularly or intravenously) and dosing intervals. While the investigators reported significant declines in p24 antigenaemia in 16/18 patients who entered with detectable levels, an accompanying editorial cautioned that pre-treatment with steroids may have confounded these measurements, although the researchers point out that only 5/51 patients received steroids. Overall, at completion of the study there was no significant change in CD4 cell count. Side-effects included mental status changes (dementia) in 6 subjects. 2/6 subjects became A-Z OF TREATMENTS 127 [Page 128](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/134?q1=directories) comatose and 1 died pneumonia). 38/51 had fevers and 23/51 developed rashes more than 36 hours after treatment. Mayer treated 20 people with AIDS, ARC or asymptomatic HIV infection with 20 pg/kg trichosanthin once every 4 weeks for up to 12 weeks. With the concurrent administration of prostaglandin inhibitors the drug was moderately well tolerated, with most participants experiencing mild arthralgia, hives and malaise. Additionally, 4 participants experienced neurological complications which resolved spontaneously without intervention. 4/20 participants showed progressive although transient reductions in p24 antigen level. 10 people with asymptomatic infection or ARC had significant increases in CD4 percentage and improved delayed hypersensitivity reactions. The group as a whole had a weight gain of 3.2 kg. Improvements in symptoms such as PGL and candidiasis were seen in some participants. Gorelick (1994) randomized 148 people with at least 9 months prior AZT either to receive continued AZT, to switch to trichosanthin (16 doses, one every 3 weeks, starting at 36, 50 and 100 pg/kg for two weeks each then 150 pg/kg for 10 weeks), or to take trichosanthin in combination with AZT. On intention-to-treat analysis there was no significant difference between the arms in terms of reduction of HIV RNA by quantitative PCR. Combination recipients were significantly more likely to experience a 100-cell increase in CD4 count (67%, versus 38% in the AZT alone group and 44% in the trichosanthin alone group). Two-thirds of trichosanthin recipients received concomitant steroids to reduce allergic responses. Individuals who switched to trichosanthin and did not receive steroids had a significantly longer time to treatment failure than those who continued on AZT monotherapy. Byers (1991b) conducted a phase II study in which 112 patients (CD4 below 500) who had received AZT or ddl for at least one year and who were failing these drugs had trichosanthin added to their treatment regimen. Participants were infused with trichosanthin (1.2 mg) weekly for 2 weeks then monthly. 65 patients had sufficient CD4 values before (311 +/- 12 days) and after (170 +/- 7 days) trichosanthin to establish changes. On anti-viral drugs alone, patients were losing CD4 cells (1.47 cells/week). After trichosanthin therapy there of CD4 cells (1.61 cells/week). Serum p24 antigen levels were elevated in 22 patients and these were not influenced by trichosanthin treatment. Lee-Huang and researchers from the National Cancer Institute have reported the development of a protein, TAP 29, derived from Trichosanthes kirilowii, which displayed in vitro anti-HIV activity as measured by syncytium formation, p24 expression and HIV reverse transcriptase activity, with a therapeutic index over two orders of magnitude higher than that of GLQ223.

Taking corticosteroids at the same time as conventional treatments for moderate-to-severe PCP has been shown to improve the chances that the PCP treatment will be successful, because the corticosteroids dampen down inflammation in the lungs. No benefit from taking corticosteroids has been found in less serious cases of PCP. Corticosteroids and anti-PCP drugs should not be stopped abruptly, as this increases the risk of a relapse in the PCP. The immunosuppression caused by corticosteroids can lead to a higher rate of infections such as oral thrush and herpes simplex while they are being taken. Very early research has suggested that immunosuppressive drugs such as the corticosteroid prednisolone might actually benefit people with early HIV infection. Although it may seem odd to use an immunosuppressive drug in people with damaged immune systems, there is a logical rationale. Some researchers believe that one of the key mechanisms by which CD4 cells are depleted in people with HIV is through an autoimmune response, in which the immune system mistakes its own component cells for 'foreign' organisms and so attacks and destroys them. Another possible way in which CD4 cells are destroyed is through apoptosis, or 'programmed cell death'. In this process, CD4 cells become anergic (literally, 'no energy') when they are exposed to foreign antigens and the next time they meet the antigen they commit suicide. Theoretically, some immunosuppressive drugs could prevent these processes. Key research Andrieu treated 44 asymptomatic people with prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg from day 0 to day 180 or 240, and 0.3 mg/g thereafter). After one year all remained asymptomatic. Lymphadenopathies resolved or decreased in 16/20. Median CD4 count increased rapidly with a peak gain of more than 200 cells at day 15, and then stabilised with a net gain of over 100 at day 360. CD8 count, p24 antigenaemia, HIV mRNA and DNA remained stable. No side-effects were seen. Lu exposed blood samples from uninfected donors to HIV and then treated some with hydrocortisone or prednisolone. HIV infection caused an increase in apoptotic cell death in PBMCs and CD4 cells. However, under 100-1000 pg/ml of glucocorticoids both cell proliferation and apoptosis were inhibited while cell survival was maintained. Key research Andrieu J-M et al.

It consists of a mixture of two drugs - trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole. The combination is used because it is harder for bacteria to develop resistance to the treatment than is the case with either drug alone. The tablet form of co-trimoxazole is most commonly used by people with HIV as prophylaxis against PCP. It may also be used to treat Shigella, urinary tract infections, 128 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 129](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/135?q1=directories) isosporiasis and bronchitis. Standard dose tablets are pink and round, and contain 80 mg trimethoprim and 400 mg sulphamethoxazole. A single double-strength (DS) tablet (pink and oval) contains twice these amounts. Intravenous co-trimoxazole is used for treating PCP, Shigella, Salmonella and severe or complicated urinary tract infections. Co-trimoxazole is also available as a suspension for children. Co-trimoxazole is available in a generic (non-brandname) formulation. It is also manufactured by Roche under the tradename Bactrim and by Wellcome under the tradename Septrin. Drug interactions Co-trimoxazole is excreted through kidneys, so people who have kidney damage may have to take lower doses because less will be excreted. The drug may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Side-effects Co-trimoxazole in either the tablet or the intravenous form causes a high level of side-effects. The most common reactions are rash, fever, leukopenia and hepatitis. More HIV-positive people develop skin rashes because of co-trimoxaole than any other drug. These rashes should be taken seriously and treatment stopped or the dose reduced because some people can develop a potentially fatal allergy called Stevens-Johnson syndrome. There have been reports of severe systemic reactions resembling anaphylaxis or toxic shock syndrome among people with HIV who have restarted co-trimoxazole after experiencing toxicity within the previous 6-8 weeks. The mechanism of this side-effect is unclear. It is generally accepted that the side-effects from co-trimoxazole are caused by the sulphamethoxazole component rather than the trimethoprim - or, to be more precise, the substance (or metabolite) into which sulphamethoxazole is converted in the body. Inherited differences may make some people more susceptible to the metabolite than others; this may explain why side-effects are less common among African, Haitian and black American people than among white people. Moreover, the toxic metabolite is usually cleared from the body by an important immune substance called glutathione, and many people with HIV have reduced levels of glutathione. This may explain why side-effects are more common among people with HIV than among healthy people or people with other forms of immune suppression. Studies are testing whether drugs that increase levels of glutathione, such as NAC, help to reduce side-effects from co-trimoxazole. Trimethoprim alone has not been tested against PCP in humans, but studies in rats showed that it was unable to prevent PCP infection whereas the co-trimoxazole combination was successful. Desensitisation A growing number of clinics offer desensitisation regimes designed to enable people who are allergic to co-trimoxazole to continue to take the drug without problems. The most extensively studied regime is used by Dr Marcus Conants practice in San Francisco. Each day the individual receives co-trimoxazole at diluted concentrations which gradually increase over an eight day period. Each day, first 1 cc of this dilution is given, followed later in the same day by 2cc, 4cc and then 8cc. On the eighth day the drug is no longer diluted and the last dose of the day consists of a standard dose double-strength tablet. This procedure has been used successfully to desensitise over 1000 people, with a success rate of 83% and no fatalities. In some cases steroids had to be given to damp down the allergic responses that can still occur during desensitisation, and some people had to have 2 or 3 attempts at the procedure before it succeeded. The benefits of desensitisation could be seen in terms of the reduced rate of opportunistic infections that individuals experienced - in a series of 100 consecutive patients, 84 were successfully desensitised and only 1 developed PCP or toxoplasmosis over a one-year follow-up period. By contrast, 8 of the 16 desensitisation failures developed PCP or toxoplasmosis during the year, despite their use of alternative forms of PCP prophylaxis. In two cases the PCP proved fatal. Research King evaluated the effect of co-trimoxazole desensitisation in 100 consecutive patients. 84 out of the 100 were desensitised, and over a one year follow up period only one developed PCP or toxoplasmosis. Moreover, even in this case there was evidence that the PCP had been developing during the desensitisation week, and does not necessarily reflect the failure of co-trimoxazoles protective effect. By contrast, 8 of the 16 desensitisation failures developed PCP or toxoplasmosis during the year, despite their use of aerosolised pentamidine (AP) as an alternative form of PCP prophylaxis and, in some people with CD4 counts less than 100, both AP and dapsone. In two cases the PCP proved fatal. Gilquin enrolled 20 patients (mean CD4 count 46) in a study of co-trimoxazole desensitisation. The regime consisted of co-trimoxazole given orally once a day in two-fold incremental doses every day for 9 days, starting with 0.4 mg trimethoprim/2 mg sulphamethoxazole. No antihistamines or corticosteroids were administered. Desensitisation was successful in 20/20 cases. A shortened schedule, omitting days 2, 4, 6 and 8 appeared equally successful. Guerin enrolled 10 HIV-positive people in 11 episodes of co-trimoxazole desensitisation, using a regime of 0.2 mg trimethoprim/1 mg sulphamethoxazole increasing every 3 hours over 48 hours until standard doses were reached. 7/11 were initially desensitised, but success lasting longer than 1 month was achieved in only 4. No difference in CD4 count between successes and failures was observed. References Consumers Association. Co-trimoxazole, or just trimethoprim? Drug & Therapeutics Bulletin 24(5): 17-19, 1986.

In test-tube studies it has been shown to inhibit HIVs long terminal repeat (LTR) - part of the viral DNA that controls its A-Z OF TREATMENTS 129 [Page 130](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/136?q1=directories) genetic information. The LTR has to be activated before latent HIV in infected cells can become active and reproduce. Studies testing whether curcumin has any antiviral effects in humans are underway. Key research Li reported that in vitro curcumin inhibited p24 antigen production in acutely infected PBMC (HIV-1 strain HTLV-IIIB). The ICso was 4 - 5 pM. At these concentrations, cell viability was 90% of normal. Curcumin also inhibited HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression stimulated by TNF or PMA. Preliminary results from a phase I study of oral curcumin 2.56 g/day conducted at SEARCH Alliance have been summarized. Nineteen patients were enrolled; the median CD4 count was 100. Treatment continued for 20 weeks. No change in CD4 count was observed. Reductions in HIV RNA (using quantitative PCR) were observed in most patients, although these levels were increasing in most patients by the end of the study. Two patients withdrew from the study because of gastro-intestinal intolerance. References Li CJ et al.

A safety and pharmacokinetics trial for CMV retinitis is underway in the USA. No toxicity information is available. Cyclobut-G is also known by the codename BMS 180-194. It is manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb. * Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide is an approved anti-cancer drug which is active, alone or in combination, against a wide spectrum of tumours. It is being tested as a treatment for lymphoma. It comes either as tablets or as a liquid for intravenous injection. Its most significant side-effects are hair loss, nausea and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia and haemorrhagic cystitis have also been observed. Cyclosphosphamide is manufactured by Pharmacia. Another version, sold under the brandname Endoxana, is made ASTA Medica. * Cycloserine Cycloserine is a tablet-form anti-mycobacterial drug which is used in combination with other drugs for treating multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. Its side-effects can include mood disturbances, headache, dizziness, vertigo, drowsiness, shakes, convulsions, psychosis, depression, rashes and changes in liver functioning. It is manufactured by Lilly under the tradename Cycloserine, or, in the USA, Seromycin. 130 A-Z OF TREATMENTS * Cyclosporin A Cyclosporin A is a powerful immunosuppressive drug derived from the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum gams. It seems to act by specifically inhibiting T-helper cell functions and blocking production of the cytokine interleukin-2. Although it may seem odd to use an immunosuppressive drug in people with damaged immune systems, there is a logical rationale for the use of cyclosporin A. Some researchers believe that one of the key mechanisms by which CD4 cells are depleted in people with HIV is through an autoimmune response, in which the immune system mistakes its own component cells for 'foreign' organisms and so attacks and destroys them. Another possible way in which CD4 cells are destroyed is through apoptosis, or 'programmed cell death'. In this process, CD4 cells become anergic (literally, 'no energy') when they are exposed to foreign antigens and the next time they meet the antigen they commit suicide. Theoretically, cyclosporin A could prevent these processes. In test-tube studies, cyclosporin A has also been observed to prevent the development of syncytia - useless clumps of uninfected CD4 cells which form around a single infected CD4 cell. Similar effects have been seen with FK 506, another immunosuppressive drug, which also prevents apoptosis (cell suicide) in the test-tube. In 1993 researchers reported that cyclosporin on its own or at low doses in combination with low doses of AZT could completely prevent HIV from infecting blood cells in the test-tube. Current use The use of cyclosporin A in people with HIV is unlicensed and experimental. Although in vitro experiments suggest that there may be a case for using cyclosporin in people with HIV, small-scale clinical trials have been contradictory, with some suggesting that the drug might stabilize the CD4 count of asymptomatic people, but others suggesting that the drug might actually worsen HIV disease. There have also been some anecdotal reports and individual case studies in which people appear to have benefitted. A review of the medical literature on people who were infected with HIV through infected transplants found that people who received cyclosporin during immunosuppressive drug treatment after the transplant (to prevent the body from rejecting the transplanted organ) were signbificantly less likely to developed AIDS during the next 5 years than people who did not receive cyclosporin. Possible side-effects from cyclosporin include liver and kidney impairment, stomach upsets, increased hair growth, receding gums and abnormally high blood levels of calcium. Some people also experience a burning sensation in their hands and feet during the first week of taking the drug. In addition, cyclosporins immunosuppressive effects could turn out to do more harm than good for HIV-infected people. Current developments Researchers are also testing the anti-HIV effects of non-immunosuppressive drugs derived from cyclosporin, such as SDZ 811. [Page 131](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/137?q1=directories) Key research Groux reported that cyclosporin prevented apoptosis in cultures of CD4 cells from HIV-positive people. Karpas reported that cyclosporin A and FK 506 inhibited syncytium formation and other cytopathic effects of HIV-1 and HIV-2 in cell culture. The replication of HIV-infected Molt 4 cells was inhibited by the drugs, while uninfected cells were unaffected. Sekigawa reported that in vitro FK 506 inhibited gpl 20-induced apoptotic cell death in PBMCs and purified human peripheral CD4 cells. Vaccarezza reported that cyclosporin significantly or completely suppressed acute HIV infection with both AZT-sensitive and AZT-resistant strains of HIV-1 in PBMC cultures. Combination of low doses of cyclosporin with low doses of AZT was also effective. Cerny reported that in mice with LP-BM5 Murine Leukaemia Virus a low dose of cyclosporin A (20 mg/kg/day) initiated 5 days after infection did not protect against virus-induced lymphoproliferation and hypergammaglobulinaemia. Combined treatment with cyclosporin and AZT had an additive, protective effect on lymphocyte proliferative capacity. Levy Rafael treated 27 HIV-positive people at various stages of disease with cyclosporin (adjusted doses of approximately 7.25 mg/kg/day). Median duration of treatment was 11 months, with median follow-up after cessation of treatment of 45 months. The median CD4 count remained stable during treatment, but decreased at its usual rate following cessation. Phillips treated 8 people with clinically stable AIDS with cyclosporin for a mean total of 49 days. Treatment resulted in decreases in several haematological markers which remained significantly depressed after cyclosporin was discontinued. Levels of culturable HIV increased and participants experienced symptoms including increased number and size of KS lesions, pain, swelling, vomiting, anorexia and fatigue. Allen treated an HIV-positive man with a CD4 count of 4 with cyclosporin (5 mg/kg/day) for psoriasis. The psoriasis cleared rapidly and remained in remission for 12 months and the individual reported a subjective impression of improved wellbeing. Jacobson reported the case of a man who was HIV-antibody positive for at least 8 years without apparent progression to AIDS or AIDS-related complex, despite being on immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporin throughout that time. Schwartz reported that in a study of people who became infected with HIV from a transplant, the 5-year cumulative incidence of AIDS was significantly lower in 40 transplant patients who received immunosuppressive therapy including cyclosporin A than in 13 who received a regimen without cyclosporin A (31% versus 90%). Rosenwirth a 4-substituted cyclosporin devoid of immunosuoppressive activity, inhibited laboratory and clinical strains of HIV in cell lines and showed synergy with AZT, ddl and protease inhibitors.

SCytarabine Cytarabine is an approved anti-cancer drug used mainly in combination with other agents for the treatment of a form of cancer called acute myeloblastic leukaemia. It is has also been reported to beneficial in the treatment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in some case reports, although in other reports it has not been effective. The drug can be given by intravenous, subcutaneous or intrathecal injection. It strongly suppresses the bone marrow and can cause a range of blood disorders, as well as nausea, vomiting, fever, anorexia and mouth ulcers. It is also known as cytosine arabinoside, or ara-C. It is available as a generic (non-brandname) drug, and is also manufactured by Pfizer under the brandname Alexan and by Upjohn under the brandname Cytosar. *Dacarbazine Dacarbazine is an approved anti-cancer drug which is used frequently in combination with other drugs for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and Hodgkin's disease. It comes as a liquid for intravenous injection. It suppresses the bone marrow, causing leukopenia and thrombocytopenia; other common side-effects include nausea, vomiting and hair loss. Dacarbazine is manufactured by Bayer under the tradename DTC-Dome. * Dapsone Dapsone is an approved oral antibiotic drug. It can be used in combination with trimethoprim for treating PCP, and may also be used as PCP prophylaxis for people who cannot tolerate co-trimoxazole. It is synergistic with pyrimethamine, a combination that is used for treating toxoplasmosis. In the test-tube it inhibits mycobacteria such as MAI, so it may also help to prevent this 01. Dapsone causes a relatively high rate of allergic skin rashes. Other side-effects include nausea and methemoglobinaemia, and haemolytic anaemia in people with glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency, a relatively common condition in African, Haitian and black American people. Dapsone remains at a high level in the body for a long time after each dose is taken, so weekly or twice weekly dosing may thus be justified. The combination of dapsone and pyrimethamine in one tablet is manufactured by Wellcome under the tradename Maloprim. A-Z OF TREATMENTS 131 [Page 132](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/138?q1=directories) Drug interactions The absorption of dapsone in the gut may be reduced if the level of acid in the stomach is below normal. This may happen in people who have achlorhydria (an absence of hydrochloric acid from the stomach juice) or if it is taken at the same time as the anti-HIV drug ddl, which includes an antacid in its formulation. People taking both dapsone and ddl should take the dapsone at least two hours before the ddl. References Coopman SA et al. Cutaneous disease and drug reactions in HIV infection.

Daunorubicin Daunorubicin is an anti-cancer drug with considerable side-effects. Researchers have developed a form of daunorubicin in which the drug is encased in fatty particles called liposomes. This liposomal daunorubicin is still in the experimental stages, but has shown some effectiveness as a treatment for Kaposis sarcoma, with fewer side-effects than standard daunorubicin. Liposomal daunorubicin is administered by intravenous injection. *ddC Like AZT and ddl, ddC is a modified form of one of the building blocks of DNA (known as nucleosides). When HIV replicates in the presence of these nucleoside analogue drugs, the virus' reverse transcriptase enzyme incorporates the drug in the place of a normal nucleoside in the growing DNA strand. This prevents the proper assembly of viral genetic material and halts viral replication. The drug is also known by the chemical name dideoxycytidine, by its generic name zalcitabine, or by its tradename HIVID. It is manufactured by Roche Products Ltd. Current use ddC was licensed in Britain in September 1994 for use on its own (as monotherapy) for adults with advanced HIV infection who have either experienced disease progression while receiving AZT or who are intolerant of AZT. The current recommended dose is 0.75mg three times a day. The main evidence leading to licensing was the study CPCRA002. In this trial, Dr Donald Abrams compared the benefits of ddl monotherapy with those of ddC monotherapy for people who can no longer benefit from AZT or who cannot tolerate its side-effects were reported. 467 participants took part; their average CD4 count was 37. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people in each group who experienced disease progression during the trial (68% on ddl vs 63% on ddC). When the results were adjusted to take account of the fact that, by chance, participants who were allocated to receive ddC tended to be slightly more ill than the ddl-treated group, there was a trend indicating that ddC may be the more effective drug in preventing disease progression and that ddC definitely was the better drug in terms of survival. The study ACTG 116 (N3492) suggested that ddC may be a better treatment than continued AZT for people who have received more than 48 weeks prior AZT - but not enough people were recruited to the trial to enable firm conclusions to be reached. For people who have not taken AZT, ddC on its own is less effective than AZT on its own in terms of survival. The most serious side-effects from ddC are peripheral neuropathy and (rarely) pancreatitis. Peripheral neuropathy usually continues to worsen for a short time after ddC treatment is stopped, but is then reversible. Other reported toxicities include ulcers in the mouth or throat, fever and rash. There have also been two reports of ddC affecting the acoustic nerves causing hearing problems. In 1993 Roche reported that extremely high doses of ddC caused lymphoma in mice. A review of human trials found that in one study (ACTG 155), people receiving ddC seemed to be more likely to develop lymphoma than people taking AZT alone. However, lymphoma occurs in a relatively high proportion of people with advanced HIV infection regardless of treatment and it is still unclear whether ddC increases that risk further. Use in combination In April 1992 the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of ddC in combination with AZT after the study ACTG 106 suggested that for people who have never taken anti-HIV drugs, the combination produced a greater increase in the CD4 count, which was sustained for longer, than AZT monotherapy. In early 1994, another study (known as BW 35,225-02) also among people who had not taken AZT before again found that the combination of AZT plus ddC (or AZT plus ddl) produced larger and longer-lasting CD4 count increases than AZT alone. However, in September 1993 the FDA's Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee recommended that this conditional approval should be revoked in the light of the disappointing results of the trial ACTG 155. This trial studied the effects of combination therapy on clinical endpoints such as disease progression and survival. The trial enrolled 1001 people with CD4 counts below 300 who had already taken AZT for an average of 18 months. Some continued to take AZT, others switched to ddC monotherapy and others started combination therapy with AZT plus ddC. Overall, no difference was seen between the three treatment groups. However, sub-group analyses suggested that the effectiveness of the treatment varied depending on the individuals' CD4 count when they joined the trial. For people with CD4 counts between 150 and 300, the combination of AZT plus ddC was more effective than continued treatment with AZT alone in preventing progression to AIDS or death. For people with CD4 counts between 50 and 150, there was no difference between the 132 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 133](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/139?q1=directories) combination or ddC alone; both were more effective than AZT alone. For people with CD4 counts less than 50, none of the three treatment regimes was better than another, although there was a trend for them to do worse on the combination. However, statisticians have stressed that this kind of sub-group analysis is inherently unreliable. It has been speculated that many people in the trial might have developed HIV strains that were resistant to AZT. This might explain the lack of difference between AZT plus ddC and ddC alone for some participants, because the AZT component of the combination was no longer of significant effect. Other researchers have suggested that the longer a person has taken AZT before switching to the AZT plus ddC combination, the less their CD4 count increases with combination therapy. In other words, it may be too much to expect combination therapy to be very useful for people who have already taken AZT for a long time, but combinations may yet prove to be valuable for people with little or no prior use of AZT. In the trial ACTG 106, combination therapy did not prevent the emergence of AZT-resistant strains of HIV, although ddC-resistant strains were not seen. This indicates that the improved CD4 response seen with combination therapy compared with AZT monotherapy in this trial cannot be ascribed to a delay in the emergence of resistance among combination recipients. Alternating therapy regimens (ACTG 047) also seem to be more effective than AZT monotherapy, but the incidence of ddC-related peripheral neuropathy remains unchanged. Both combination and alternating regimens are being studied to see if they prevent the emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV. However, there has been one report of an individual in whom the use of alternating therapy for 2.5 years may actually have encouraged the development of HIV strains resistant to both AZT and ddC. Laboratory tests performed by Wellcome, manufacturers of AZT, suggest that the triple combination of AZT, ddC and alpha interferon works particularly well against both laboratory strains of HIV and 'wild' strains taken from people. At a relatively low concentration of AZT, the three-drug combination completely blocked HIV's ability to damage cells (its cytopathic effect). A multicentre trial of this combination is currently underway in the United States. Getting it Since March 1992 the Medical Research Council has been running the Delta trial - a study of concurrent AZT and either ddl or ddC. All participants receive AZT and some are randomly assigned also to receive ddC or ddl. This trial is ongoing but is no longer recruiting new participants. The MRC is also participating in the PENTA 3 study evaluating the safety and tolerability of AZT plus ddC in children. Key research - ddC monotherapy In September 1994 ddC was approved as monotherapy for the treatment of HIV infection in people who are intolerant of AZT. The clinical trial ACTG 114 found that AZT is superior to ddC for first-line treatment of advanced HIV infection. However, the trial CPCRA 002 (See Abrams, below) found that ddC was equivalent or superior to the approved second-line treatment ddl for people who are intolerant of or failing on AZT. The relative efficacy of ddC compared to AZT in patients with long-term prior AZT treatment has not been established. Sande reported the guidelines on the use of anti-retroviral drugs drawn up by an independent panel convened by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID). These recommend monotherapy with either ddC or ddl for the following groups of people: symptomatic people with CD4 counts below 500 who experience therapeutic failure on AZT; asymptomatic people with CD4 counts between 50 and 500 who are intolerant to initial therapy with AZT; and all people with CD4 counts below 50 who are intolerant to initial therapy with AZT. ACTG 114, a double-blind controlled clinical trial comparing AZT with ddC, was stopped early in January 1992 after interim results showed a significant difference in survival in favour of those participants on AZT. 635 patients with either AIDS or ARC and CD4 counts 200/mm3 who had either zero or less than three months' prior use of AZT were randomised to ddC 0.75 mg every 8 hours or AZT 200 mg every six hours, then 100 mg every four hours. A one-year interim analysis showed a statistically significant survival benefit for the AZT group. The most recent intent-to-treat analysis shows that 101/320 (32%) ddC recipients and 73/315 (23%) AZT recipients have died. Median treatment period was 10.2 months for the ddC group and 12.4 months for the AZT group. An earlier (six-month) interim analysis showed that CD4 count increases were greater in the AZT group during the first 20 weeks; this difference was not significant after 20 weeks. At six months, 27/300 patients on ddC (9%) and 18/300 on AZT (6%) had to discontinue treatment due to adverse reactions. 18/27 ddC discontinuations resulted from peripheral neuropathy and the remainder were caused by oral aphthous ulcers, elevated LFT and neutropenia or anaemia. resulted toxicity. Fischl compared ddC and AZT in AIDS/advanced ARC patients with more than 48 weeks' prior AZT treatment (ACTG 119). The study was originally designed to enrol 320 patients, but only enrolled 115. Due to this small sample size the study has insufficient power either to prove or to disprove the efficacy of ddC relative to AZT in this population. 59 participants received AZT (500 to 1200 mg/day) and 52 received ddC (2.25 mg/day). Because significantly more patients withdrew from AZT therapy, the median duration of treatment was greater in the ddC group than in the AZT group (279.0 days compared with 1 74.5 days). There was no significant difference between the estimated 12-month event-free probabilities, which were 53% for the ddC group and 57% for the AZT group. The estimated 12-month survival rates were not significantly different (81% for the ddC group and 75% for the AZT group). The rate of decline in CD4 counts was significantly slower in the ddC group than in the AZT group. Patients in the ddC group had gained an average of 0.5 kg at week 20 and 0.4 kg at week 24, whereas patients in the AZT group had lost an average of 1.8 kg at week 20 and 2.4 kg at week 24. Moderate to severe peripheral neuropathy and ulcerative stomatitis occurred in 10 and 9 patients, respectively, in the ddC group. Abrams reported on the Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS trial CPCRA 002, which compared ddl (500 mg/day, adjusted according to body weight) to ddC (2.25 mg/day or 1.1.25 mg/day, depending on weight) as salvage monotherapies in patients who could not tolerate or whose disease had progressed on AZT therapy. The median CD4 count was 37 and participants had taken AZT for an average of 17 months. 467 patients were randomized to either therapy and followed for at least one year. Progression of disease was observed in 157/230 ddl recipients and 152/237 ddC recipients. There is no statistically significant difference between these rates. There were 100 deaths in the ddl group and 88 in the ddC group. After adjustment for baseline imbalances, the risk of disease progression was in the direction of favouring ddC (P = 0.15) and the risk of death definitely indicated an advantage for ddC (P = 0.003). A majority of participants in each group (66%) had at least one adverse event during treatment. In the USA over 5,000 people who failed or were intolerant of AZT or ddl received ddC through an expanded access scheme. Participants received either 0.375 mg/kg every 8 hours, or 0.75 mg/kg every 8 hours. A survival analysis was conducted on the first 3,479 participants enrolled. After a mean treatment period of 10 weeks, 296 of half-dose recipients and 260 patients on standard dose had died. In an analysis of toxicity information for the first 833 patients entered, 25/833 (3%) patients discontinued treatment because of toxicity; 13/25 and 3/25 due to peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis respectively. Pancreatitis occurred in 0.3% of those receiving the lower dose and 0.5% of those receiving the higher dose; peripheral neuropathy has been seen in 10.8% and 14.9% respectively. ddC in combination with AZT In September 1993 the US Food and Drug Administration's Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee recommended that the conditional approval of ddC for use in combination with AZT, which was granted in April 1992 in the light of Meng's research (below), should be revoked in the light of the disappointing results from the trial ACTG 155 (Fischl, below) Fischl enrolled 1001 people with CD4 counts below 300 who had greater than 6 months' prior AZT in ACTG 155, a comparison of continued AZT (600 mg/day, 283 participants), ddC monotherapy (0.75 mg three times a day, 285 participants) and AZT (600 mg/day) plus ddC (0.75 mg three times a day) combination therapy (423 participants). Participants had a median duration of prior AZT use of 12 months. After a mean follow-up of 18 months, overall no difference was seen in time to a new AIDS-defining event or death. No survival difference was seen. Sub-group analyses showed that for participants with baseline CD4 count below 50, there was no significant difference between the treatment arms, although there was a A-Z OF TREATMENTS 133 [Page 134](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/140?q1=directories) trend towards a disadvantage to combination therapy. For participants with CD4 counts between 50 - 150, there was no difference between the combination arm and AZT monotherapy, although there was a trend towards a disadvantage to ddC monotherapy. For participants with CD4 counts above 150, combination therapy was significantly superior to AZT monotherapy and there was no significant difference between the combination and ddC monotherapy. Toxicities were more common in the combination arm. Neutropenia occurred in 19 combination, 17 AZT monotherapy and 9 ddC monotherapy recipients. Moderate or severe peripheral neuropathy occurred in 21, 13 and 23 people in combination, AZT and ddC recipients respectively. Meng enrolled 56 AIDS/advanced ARC patients who had never received anti-retroviral therapy in a phase 1/11 open-label dose-finding study of the combination of ddC and AZT (ACTG 106). Patients were randomised to receive one of six regimes every eight hours (50, 100 or 200 mg of AZT with either 0.005 or 0.01 mg/kg of ddC; another group received AZT alone at 50 mg every eight hours; no group received standard-dose AZT alone. Eight patients were enrolled in each arm and patients who were withdrawn from the study before eight weeks were replaced. All groups experienced early increases in CD4 counts. The mean maximum increase in CD4 counts ranged between 81 and 121 for the groups receiving combination therapy. The mean maximal increase was 36 cells in the group receiving low-dose AZT. These differences were not statistically significant. Counts increased by 50 cells or more in 25/36 patients (69%) receiving combinations with the 300 mg or 600 mg/day doses of AZT; regimens containing 600 mg AZT daily were also more likely to result in persistent increases in CD4 counts above pre-treatment values. 3/5 groups receiving combination therapy maintained CD4 increases over baseline for more than a year. p24 antigenmia decreased in all patients who were p24 antigenaemic at entry. Mean patient weight increased and was sustained in all groups. Nine opportunistic infections occurred, with no difference in frequency between groups. The decline in CD4 counts was more rapid and the suppression of p24 antigenaemia was less rapid and less sustained in patients receiving the low-dose AZT monotherapy, suggesting that 150 mg/day may be a sub-optimal dose. Neither drug affected the pharmacokinetics of the other. Hamatological toxicity occurred in 17.9% of patients and did not differ among the regimens. Severe neuropathy occurred in 2 patients. In all, side-effects required drug discontinuation in 4 patients. Toxicities were equally frequent in all groups. Schooley randomised 180 people with CD4 counts less than 300 and less than 4 weeks' prior AZT therapy to receive either AZT monotherapy (600 mg/day), AZT plus ddl (200 mg/day) or AZT plus ddC (2.25 mg/day) (study BW 34,225-02). The peak percentage increase in CD4 count was 60% in the AZT/ddl group and 59% in the AZT/ddC group, compared with 17% in the AZT monotherapy group. After 17 weeks, AZT monotherapy recipients had experienced an average CD4 decrease to 50% below baseline, compared with 12% below baseline in the AZT/ddl group and 14% in the AZT/ddC group. Data on viral resistance is under analysis. Held randomized 21 HIV-infected people with at least one year of prior AZT monotherapy to receive either ddC (0.75 mg three times daily) or ddC in combination with AZT (500 mg/day). All patients had experienced AZT failure in terms of declining CD4 counts. Clinical improvement (weight gain and reduced symptoms) was observed equally in both groups. Significant CD4 increases at one and three months were only observed in the ddC monotherapy group. In a retrospective analysis of 68 patients treated with AZT plus ddC for a mean of 30 weeks, Poppinger reported that failure of immunological response to combination therapy was predicted by duration of AZT pretreatment. Montaner compared the efficacy of AZT plus ddl with that of AZT plus ddC in a partially randomized study which enrolled 136 people with CD4 counts between 50-350. Both regimes produced a significant rise in CD4 count, with a trend in favour of AZT plus ddl. Adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation have occurred in 26% and 20% of ddl and ddC treated participants respectively. James reported that in vitro studies conducted by Wellcome have suggested that the triple-drug combination of AZT, ddC and alpha interferon is synergistic in its inhibition of the cytopathic effect of both laboratory and ex vivo strains of HIV. ddC alternating with AZT In three separate studies comparing alternating treatment regimens of AZT and ddC to continuous AZT, Skowron and Bozzette failed to show any statistically significant differences in efficacy and toxicity between continuous versus alternating therapy. Skowron enrolled 131 people with AIDS/ARC in a 7-arm alternating-regimen trial of AZT and ddC (ACTG 047). Patients received AZT (200 mg every four hours) alternating weekly or monthly with ddC (0.01 or 0.03 mg/kg every four hours), or intermittent or continuous AZT or intermittent ddC (0.03 mg/kg every four hours) alone. Mean treatment duration was 40 weeks. The most withdrawals for toxicity occurred in the weekly alternating high-dose ddC/AZT arm (7/18 withdrew, 5/7 for peripheral neuropathy) and the intermittent ddC alone arm (6/17 withdrew, 6/6 for peripheral neuropathy). Most neuropathies developed in the first 20 weeks of treatment and none occurred after 30 weeks of treatment. The alternating monthly regimens had the lowest risk of neuropathy. Similar rates of opportunistic infections and malignancies occurred in the seven arms. Three patients died. Sustained increases in the CD4 cell count past 24 weeks were observed most frequently in patients receiving alternating treatment. Patients with higher baseline CD4 counts had greater increases while on therapy. Bozzette enrolled 109 patients who had previously experienced haematological intolerance to AZT in a 'salvage protocol' which studied the same alternating and intermittent AZT/ddC regimens employed in ACTG 047. The most frequent dose-limiting toxicity was peripheral neuropathy. All toxicities occurred more frequently than in ACTG 047. The one-year cumulative risk of dose-limiting toxicity was 60% in the weekly alternating regimens and 36% in the monthly alternating regimens. Researchers at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey reported that alternating AZT and ddC monotherapy for 2.4 years may have encouraged the development of multiple mutations in the pol gene of HIV in one individual, resulting in HIV strains that were resistant to both drugs. Children Pizzo conducted a pilot study to determine whether a short course of ddC could provide safe antiretroviral activity in children with symptomatic HIV infection and whether it could be used with AZT, with the goal of maintaining uninterrupted antiretroviral therapy while sparing AZT-related myelosuppression and ddC-related neuropathy. 4 dosage levels of ddC (0.015, 0.02, 0.03 and 0.04 mg/kg orally every 6 hours) were given to 15 children aged between 6 months and 13 years. 13/15 had not had any prior antiretroviral therapy; 2/15 had benefited from AZT but dose-limiting neutropenia had developed. At each dosage level, ddC was given for 8 weeks and then stopped. After a 30-day rest, a schedule of ddC for 1 week was followed by 3 weeks of AZT (180 mg/m every 6 hours); this alternating schedule was repeated for as long as tolerated. Age-appropriate psychometric testing was performed before the start of ddC therapy and after 8 weeks. During the 8 weeks of therapy with ddC alone, no neutropenia or anaemia was observed. 6/9 patients had decreases in p24 antigen levels and 8/15 had an increased CD4 cell count. A rash developed in three patients received 0.04 mg/kg. Mild mouth sores developed in 9/15 patients. On the alternating ddC/AZT schedule, no neuropathy was observed. Resistance Shirasaka found that HIV isolated from people who had received AZT alone had become AZT-resistant in vitro, while HIV isolated from people who had received alternating therapy remained sensitive to AZT. Richman analysed sequential viral isolates from 15 participants in ACTG 106 who received more than 6 months of combination treatment with AZT plus ddC. 8/11 (73%) of isolates obtained between weeks 24 and 48 of therapy were AZT-resistant, indicating that combination therapy did not prevent the emergence of AZT-resistant strains and that the improved CD4 response seen in combination recipients in this study cannot be ascribed to delayed emergence of resistance. No changes in ddC susceptibility were detected. Side-effects A phase 1/11 safety and efficacy trial conducted by Merigan established that uninterrupted use of ddC at high doses (between 0.005 and 0.06 mg/kg every 4 hours) is associated with a high incidence of peripheral neuropathy. More recent clinical trials employ lower doses of ddC (between 0.005 and 0.01 mg every 8 hours) either alone, or in combination, or alternating with AZT. Berger found that at these lower doses only a minority of patients developed clinical or laboratory evidence of neuropathy. Chen suggested that neuropathy could be a consequence of inhibition of mitochondrial DNA by ddC. LeLacheur reported that ddC-related peripheral neuropathy may be exacerbated by subsequent use of ddl. While peripheral neuropathy is the most frequently reported toxicity, oral aphthous ulcers, fever, rash and stomatitis have also been reported. Greenspan reported that in a snapshot survey of 238 people taking antiretroviral therapy, 29% of ddC recipients were found to have mouth ulcers comapred with 15% of AZT or ddl recipeints. Oesophageal ulcers have also been reported (e.g. by Indorf). Martinez and Powderley reported that ddC can also affect the acoustic nerves causing hearing problems. Pancreatitis has been reported (e.g. by Aponte) as a rare complication of ddC therapy (incidence to date approximately 1%). Salgo reported that at doses hundreds of times higher than those used in humans, ddC caused thymic lymphoma in female mice. A review of human trial data concluded that many people with advanced AIDS develop lymphomas irrespective of treatment. In one study (ACTG 155), lymphomas did appear to be more common in people receiving ddC monotherapy or in combination with AZT, compared with AZT alone. However, data from large 134 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 135](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/141?q1=directories) numbers of people would be needed to definitively conclude whether ddC or any other antiretroviral treatment has any influence on the rate of lymphomas in people with AIDS. Rao confirmed the carcinogenicity of ddC in mice. Irons reviewed the potential mechanisms by which ddC induces thymic lymphoma and concluded that mouse studies are not a reliable predictor of ddCs likely toxicities in humans. AZT and ddC do not appear to induce synergistic toxicity. In ACTG 106, severe side-effects (anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and peripheral neuropathy) occurred in 16 patients and required drug discontinuation in four patients. Toxicities were equally frequent in all groups. In ACTG 047, the most withdrawals for toxicity occurred in the weekly alternating high-dose ddC/AZT arm (7/16 withdrew, 5/7 for peripheral neuropathy) and the intermittent ddC alone arm (6/16 withdrew, 6/6 for peripheral neuropathy). Most neuropathies developed in the first 20 weeks of treatment and none occurred after 30 weeks of treatment. The alternating monthly regimens had the lowest risk of neuropathy.

When HIV replicates in the presence of these nucleoside analogue drugs, the virus' reverse transcriptase enzyme incorporates the drug in the place of a normal nucleoside in the growing DNA strand. This prevents the proper assembly of viral genetic material and halts viral replication. ddl is also known by the chemical name dideoxyinosine, by the generic name didanosine and by its tradename Videx. It is manufactured by Bristol Myers-Squibb. Use in AZT-intolerant people ddl is a licensed drug for the treatment of people who are intolerant of AZT or are experiencing disease progression despite taking AZT. The European/Australian Alpha study of ddl enrolled 1930 participants, over 50% of whom had previously taken AZT for at least 12 months. Participants could choose to enter either a part of the trial in which they were randomly allocated to receive either a lower dose of ddl (200 mg/day in sachet formulation, in two divided doses) or a higher dose (750 mg/day), or an option in which they were randomly allocated to either the lower dose of ddl, the higher dose or an inactive placebo. Almost all chose not to enter the placebo arm, so the efficacy of ddl versus no treatment could not be established. People who took the higher dose of ddl had a higher level of side-effects. Overall, there was no difference in survival between the two dose groups. After one year, 53% of people allocated to the higher dose were still alive, compared with 52% of the lower dose arm. The failure to recruit to the placebo-controlled option means that there is no group of untreated people with whom to compare this. In other words, either both doses of ddl are equally effective in prolonging survival, or neither dose of ddl improves survival. In Alpha, people with higher CD4 counts at the start of the trial had better survival. Individuals whose CD4 counts rose A-Z OF TREATMENTS 135 [Page 136](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/142?q1=directories) when they started taking ddl were more likely to survive (46% of those with an increase at two months were still alive at the end of the trial) than people whose CD4 counts remained stable or fell when they started the drug (30% alive at the end of the trial). In a letter to the Lancet, the International Coordinating Committee of the Alpha study recommended that people who are eligible for ddl, because they have stopped benefitting from or are experiencing serious side-effects from AZT, should be offered ddl at a dose lower than 750 mg/day. This is because the only difference between the 200 mg/day and the 750 mg/day doses used in Alpha was the higher level of side-effects with 750 mg/day. An American trial, ACTG 118, enrolled 650 people who had AIDS or ARC and a CD4 count below 300, or who were asymptomatic but had a CD4 count less than 200. All were intolerant of AZT, having previously taken it for an average of 8 months. Participants took ddl at a dose of 200 mg/day, 500 mg/day or 750 mg/day. People in the two higher dose arms had a significant increase in their CD4 count, especially if it was still above 50 when they joined the trial. But as in Alpha, there was no difference between the three groups in terms of the development of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections or death. People whose CD4 count increased by more than 50% or by more than 10 cells were more likely to stay stable for longer and survive for longer than people without such a CD4 response. People who had taken AZT for a relatively short period before the trial also had a better prognosis than those who had taken prolonged AZT. The study CPCRA 002 compared ddl monotherapy with ddC monotherapy for people who can no longer benefit from AZT or who cannot tolerate its side-effects. 467 participants took part; their average CD4 count was 37. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people in each group who experienced disease progression during the trial (68% on ddl vs 63% on ddC). When the results were adjusted to take account of the fact that, by chance, participants who were allocated to receive ddC tended to be slightly more ill than the ddl-treated group, there was a trend indicating that ddC may be the more effective drug in preventing disease progression and that ddC definitely was the better drug in terms of survival. Switching from AZT Several studies have suggested that it may be beneficial for people taking AZT to switch to ddl after a relatively short period of treatment. However, ddl is not licensed for use in this way. The trial ACTG 1 16A compared the effectiveness of AZT (600 mg/day) and ddl (500 mg/day or 750 mg/day) for people with relatively advanced HIV disease who had previously taken little or no AZT. The trial enrolled 61 7 people with AIDS or advanced ARC with CD4 counts of 300 or less, or asymptomatic infection with CD4 counts of 200 or less. The results appear to show that AZT is the better drug for those who have not previously taken it. However, those who had taken between eight and sixteen weeks of AZT had fewer AIDS-defining illnesses if they switched to ddl. People who hadn't taken AZT before also survived longer if they received AZT rather than ddl, while those with 8-16 weeks of prior AZT use lived longer if they took ddl rather than AZT. The 500 mg/day dose of ddl was at least as effective as the 750 mg/day dose and less toxic. ACTG 1 16B/117 reported on the benefits of switching from AZT to ddl after 16 weeks or longer on AZT. People with asymptomatic HIV infection or ARC who switched to sachets of ddl at 500 mg/day developed fewer opportunistic infections or other new AIDS defining events than either those who continued taking AZT or those who switched to ddl at 750 mg/day. Survival rates were similar for both AZT and ddl, although the trial was not designed to allow firm conclusions on survival. Analysis of this trial showed that the development of AZT resistance was the best predictor of a poor response to treatment in ACTG 116B/11 7. People with AZT-resistant strains tended to have a poor prognosis regardless of whether they continued to take AZT or stopped taking AZT and switched over to ddl. A Bristol-Myers Squibb trial enrolled 311 people who had taken AZT for at least 6 months and had experienced recent disease progression. They either continued to take AZT, or switched to high-dose ddl (750 mg/day). People who switched to ddl were less likely to experience further disease progression (defined as death, or a new AIDS-defining event, or two new or recurrent HIV-related diagnoses plus a 50% fall in CD4 count). The benefits of switching to ddl were most pronounced in people whose CD4 count was above 100 when they switched. No benefit from switching was seen in people who had already taken AZT for less than 12 months. When the two treatments were compared for their effects on survival alone, no differences were seen. These studies suggest that in the future it may become standard practice for people taking AZT to switch to ddl after only a few months, rather than waiting until they are clearly no longer benefiting from the AZT. A number of studies have suggested that switching to ddl led to CD4 count increases, particularly for people who had not yet developed AIDS, although it did not result in longer survival compared with remaining on AZT. The development of ddl-resistant strains of HIV has been seen after some months taking the drug. There is some evidence that people with HIV strains that have become resistant to AZT may regain sensitivity to AZT after treatment with ddl; however, it is also clear that strains of virus resistant to both AZT and ddl can develop. There are also suggestions that the virus mutations that make HIV resistant to ddl may have a very significant effect on the effectiveness of ddl therapy only when the virus has previously developed resistance to AZT. Side-effects ddl can have potentially fatal side-effects. The commonest problems seen are pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhoea and mental changes. Side-effects are dose-related: they are more common the higher the dose taken. Pancreatitis was reported in about 17% of Phase I/I11 trial participants and about 5% of people taking part in the US expanded access programme. In the ACTG 116B/11 7 and Alpha studies, the risk of pancreatitis was greater at higher doses of ddl. In ACTG 116B/11 7, for example, pancreatitis developed in 10% of people taking a 750 mg/day dose but only 6% of those reciving 500 mg/day. Early signs of pancreatic damage are commoner. In people who develop it, the average time of onset has been around 3-4 months; trials suggest that the risk of pancreatitis reduces with time on ddl. Pancreatitis appears 136 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 137](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/143?q1=directories) to develop more frequently in those with advanced HIV disease, concurrent MAI or CMV, a history of pancreatitis and perhaps those receiving rifampicin, rifabutin or ganciclovir. There is also some evidence that people taking ulcer-healing drugs, such as H2 blockers and omeprazole, at the same time as ddl may be at increased risk of pancreatitis perhaps because like the buffer in the ddl formulation, these drugs reduce the acidity in the stomach, possibly leading to an increased absorption of a higher dose of ddl. Peripheral neuropathy was initially seen quite often but would appear only to be a problem in those given high doses of the drug. It also occurs more frequently among people with signs or symptoms of advanced HIV infection. It usually goes away if the drug is stopped, and treatment can often then be resumed at a lower dose without recurrence of the neuropathy. Hyperuricaemia (a high level of uric acid which may cause gout) is another complication which seems only to affect people taking high doses. Diarrhoea that forced people to stop taking ddl or reduce the dose occurred in about 29% of people in the phase 1/11 trials and 16% of US expanded access participants, all of whom were receiving the sachet formulation of the drug. It is not known whether the chewable tablet formulation that is now on the market carries the same risk of diarrhoea. Other side-effects reported by 2% or more of people in trials of ddl include nausea or vomiting; chills pneumonia; confusion; and insomnia. Liver failure of unknown cause has occurred rarely among people taking ddl. Liver enzyme levels should be monitored and treatment should be permanently stopped if they rise significantly above normal. Retina or optic nerves changes have also been reported rarely. Children taking ddl seem to be at the greatest risk of retinal lesions and their eyes should be checked by an opthalmologist every 4 to 6 months during treatment. Use in combination The preliminary data that is available to date suggests that, like the combination of AZT with ddC, simultaneous use of AZT and ddl may produce larger CD4 cell count rises that may be sustained for longer than either drug on its own. But it is still not known whether the combination leads to slower disease progression or improved survival compared to single-drug monotherapy. Surrogate markers suggest that simultaneous AZT/ddl treatment is likely to be more effective than alternating AZT/ddl treatment. In addition, combination regimens are being studied to see if they prevent the emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV. The rationale for anti-retroviral combination therapy is strongly supported by the finding that when AZT-resistant HIV strains are exposed to ddl, they often develop resistance to ddl but regain sensitivity to AZT. Since March 1992 the Medical Research Council has been running the Delta trial - a study of concurrent AZT and either ddl or ddC. All participants receive AZT and some are randomly assigned also to receive ddC or ddl. This trial is ongoing but is no longer recruiting new participants. Researchers have reported that in laboratory studies, the combination of ddl and ribavirin produces enhanced anti-HIV activity. ddl-resistant strains of HIV could still be treated effectively with the combination. Trials of the combination are currently underway in the US. Zhang reported that in vitro pentoxifylline enhances the anti-HIV effect of ddl. Taking it ddl is excreted very slowly (has a long 'half-life') which gives it the advantage that it only needs to be taken twice a day. It comes as a round, white, mint-flavoured tablet that should be chewed, crushed or dispersed in water prior to taking. If additional flavouring is required clear apple juice can be added to the tablet dispersed in water. Occasionally in some trials or for children, ddl comes as sachets of white powder which is mixed with water and drunk. The standard dose for adults who weigh over 60 kg is 200 mg twice daily. For adults under 60 kg the dose is 125 mg twice daily. Both the tablet and the sachet forms contain an antacid powder to prevent the drug being destroyed by the acidity of the stomach. The antacid in the sachet may be the cause of the diarrhoea which occurs in about 15% of patients taking it; it is hoped that diarrhoea will be less common with the tablet formulation. It is important to take the recommended number of tablets for each dose, as there is not enough antacid in each tablet on its own to decrease the acidity of the stomach. The drug should be taken at least 30 minutes before a meal or at least 4 hours after a meal to ensure that it is properly absorbed. Other drugs which require an acidic stomach environment for proper absorption (e.g. dapsone, ketoconazole and others) should be taken at least 2 hours before ddl. People taking ddl should be alert for early symptoms of pancreatitis. Symptoms to look out for are abdominal pain, fever, vomiting or general worsening of health. Since pancreatitis is very serious and can be abrupt in onset extra careful monitoring and self-monitoring are recommended. You should have regular monthly checks of the level of pancreatic amylase in your blood, which is an enzyme produced by the pancreas; a marked rise can precede an attack of pancreatitis, suggesting that treatment should be suspended. People who have kidney or liver abnormalities may be advised to take a lower dose of ddl. ddl should not be taken with any tetracycline antibiotic. People taking both oral ganciclovir and ddl may be at increased risk for pancreatitis. Based on preliminary data from ongoing placebo-controlled studies, the manufacturer of oral ganciclovir reports that plasma levels of ddl are increased in people also receiving oral ganciclovir, possibly accounting for the interaction. Among more than 400 participants in clinical trials of oral ganciclovir, 8 developed pancreatitis, of whom 7 were receiving oral ganciclovir. Five of these seven individuals were also receiving ddl. Bristol Myers-Squibb has also recommended that ddl should not be combined with intravenous (as opposed to aerosolised) pentamidine. Key research - ddl for AZT-experienced people ddl is approved for the treatment of adults and children (over 6 months old) with advanced HIV infection who are intolerant of AZT therapy or who have A-Z OF TREATMENTS 137 [Page 138](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/144?q1=directories) demonstrated clinical or immunological deterioration during AZT treatment. Recently the US license was extended to include patients with advanced HIV infection who have received prolonged prior treatment with AZT. The recommended dosages are 200 mg tablets twice daily for adults who weigh more than 60 kg and 125 mg tablets twice daily for adults who weigh less than 60 kg. The equivalent recommended doses of the sachet buffered powder formulation are 250 mg twice daily and 167 mg twice daily respectively. The recommended dosages are 100 mg tablets twice daily or 125 mg buffered powder twice daily for children with body surface area (BSA) of 1.1 - 1.4 m; 75 mg tablets twice daily or 94 mg buffered powder twice daily for children with BSA between 0.8 - 1.0 m; 50 mg tablets twice daily or 62 mg buffered powder twice daily for children with BSA between 0.5 - 0.7 m2; and 25 mg tablets twice daily or 31 mg buffered powder twice daily for children with BSA less than 0.4 m. Lower doses should be considered in people with liver or kidney abnormalities. The approval of ddl was based primarily on data from 4 non-randomised phase I studies conducted by Cooley, Drusano, Lambert and Yarchoan (1989, 1990), in which subjects experienced CD4 increases compared to historical controls. Additional toxicity data came from the results of an expanded-access program which, prior to the drug's approval, provided ddl to more than 20,000 patients who were intolerant of or had failed AZT. In April 1992 the FDA Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee considered data from ACTG 116B/117 (summarised below) and concluded that ddl also has clinical benefits in patients previously treated with AZT. Kahn enrolled 913 people with AIDS (30%), or AIDS-related symptoms with CD4 counts below 300 (60%), or asymptomatic HIV infection with CD4 counts less than 200 (10%) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study comparing ddl with AZT (ACTG 116B/1 17). All had taken AZT for at least four months. Participants either switched from AZT to ddl (weight adjusted doses of 500 mg/day; 298 participants) or 750 mg/day (311 participants)), or continued taking AZT (600 mg/day, 304 participants). A total of 334 participants developed a primary efficacy endpoint of new AIDS-defining event or death, 115 for ddl 750 mg (37% - 57 deaths and 84 Ols), 125 for AZT (41% - 54 deaths and 104 Ols) and 94 for ddl 500 mg (31% - 49 deaths and 73 Ols). There was a statistically significant delay in time to first new AIDS-defining event or death among those randomised to ddl 500 mg compared with those receiving AZT (one year rates 28% and 40% respectively). The comparison between ddl 750 mg and AZT was not statistically significant (one year rates 34% and 40% respectively). The duration of AZT therapy prior to study entry did not seem to influence outcome. Time to primary endpoint, first new event or death, was not different among the treatment arms for participants with an entry diagnosis of AIDS; among those with ARC or asymptomatic infection, ddl 500 mg was significantly superior to AZT in time to new AIDS-defining 01 or death as was ddl 750 mg. Mean CD4 cell count change relative to baseline and mean CD4 values over time were consistently higher in both the ddl arms. There were no survival differences among the study arms. There was a total of 160 deaths (57 for ddl 750 mg, 54 for AZT, 49 for ddl 500 mg). Dose-limiting haematological toxicity occurred in 91 AZT recipients, compared with 66 receiving ddl 750 mg and 70 receiving ddl 500 mg. The one-year cumulative incidence of pancreatitis was 15%, 8% and 5% for ddl 750 mg, ddl 500 mg and AZT, respectively. The cumulative one-year incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 15%; there were no differences in time to grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy among the treatment groups. D'Aquila (1993) reported that the development of high-level AZT resistance was the most significant independent predictor of poor prognosis among participants in ACTG 116B/117. 26/170 participants had high level resistance at baseline. After adjustment for other factors that independently predicted progression, such as baseline CD4 count, SI phenotype, prior AIDS diagnosis and randomisation to continued AZT rather than ddl, the relative risk associated with high level AZT resistance was 1.7. Preliminary results from the European/Australian Alpha study suggest that lower doses of ddl (sachet formulation) are as effective as higher doses in symptomatic patients intolerant to AZT. Darbyshire and Aboulker report that 1,930 patients were randomized to receive ddl 750 mg/day (higher dose) or ddl 200 mg/day (lower dose). Preliminary data were presented on 1,775 patients. 61% of these patients had AIDS and 55% had received longer than 12 months' prior treatment with AZT. 65% had a CD4 count below 50 on entry. Mean follow-up was 12 months. Median survival was equivalent in the two groups (12.9 months on higher dose and 12.4 months on lower dose). Among the 691 patients who entered the study without AIDS, 49% of patients on higher dose and 44% of patients on lower dose had progressed to AIDS or died after one year. A higher proportion of recipients of the higher dose showed a CD4 response (51% vs 38%). 46% of participants with a CD4 response at two months were still alive at the end of the trial, compared with 30% of CD4 non-responders. Lower dose ddl was substantially less toxic than higher dose. Pancreatitis occurred in 41 patients on higher dose (4.5%) and 5 on lower dose (0.6%); the pancreatitis was fatal in 7 patients on higher dose and 1 on lower dose. Allan enrolled 650 people who had demonstrated haematological intolerance to AZT therapy in ACTG 118. Fifty percent of the participants had AIDS at entry, and the median CD4 count at baseline was 33. Participants were randomized to receive ddl 200, 500 or 750 mg/day in two divided doses. No differences in the rates of progression to new AIDS-defining events or death were detected among the three groups. The largest CD4 increases were observed in participants on high-dose ddl, especially in those who entered the study with higher baseline counts. Peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis occurred more frequently in the high-dose group. Abrams reported on the Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS trial CPCRA 002, which compared ddl (500 mg/day, adjusted according to body weight) to ddC (2.25 mg/day or 1.1.25 mg/day, depending on weight) as salvage monotherapies in patients who could not tolerate or whose disease had progressed on AZT. The median CD4 count was 37 and participants had taken AZT for an average of 17 months. 467 patients were randomized to either therapy and followed for at least one year. Progression of disease was observed in 157/230 ddl recipients and 152/237 ddC recipients. There is no statistically significant difference between these rates. There were 100 deaths in the ddl group and 88 in the ddC group. After adjustment for baseline imbalances, the risk of disease progression was in the direction of favouring ddC and the risk of death definitely indicated an advantage for ddC. A majority of participants in each group (66%) had at least one adverse event during treatment. The ddl Iberian Study Group randomized 400 people who were clinically failing AZT therapy to receive continued AZT (600 mg/day; 133 participants), ddl (500 mg/day; 131 participants), or ddl (200 mg/day; 136 participants). The primary endpoints were disease progression and death. After one year's follow-up, a significantly lower rate of progression was observed in the ddl (500 mg/day) group compared with the AZT group; the rates per 100 person-years of follow-up were 59, 41, and 58 in the AZT, ddl (500 mg/day) and ddl (200 mg/day) groups respectively. The death rates were statistically equivalent (18, 16 and 24 deaths per 100 person-years of follow-up). Nelson treated 151 HIV-positive people who were intolerant of AZT with ddl at a dose adjusted by weight to a maximum of 1 2.5 mg/kg/day. After 1 year of follow-up, 49 patients were still receiving ddl; 19 had died during therapy and 23 thereafter. Therapy had been discontinued in 10 cases because of continued deterioration in health and in the remainder because of adverse reactions. Only 11/38 patients who were p24 antigenaemic at baseline had a significant reduction in titre. The CD4 count was more likely to rise for patients who had only constitutional disease due to HIV than for those with AIDS. 11% of treated patients gained more than 2.5 kg in weight. Diarrhoea was the commonest side-effect, occurring in 60% of cases. Pancreatitis developed in 6 cases (with two deaths) and asymptomatic hyperamylasaemia in 13. 7 patients developed glucose tolerance in the diabetic range. Peripheral neuropathy was documented in 12 instances but was reversible on cessation of therapy in 6. Spruance enrolled 312 people with at least 6 months' AZT-experience (median 17.5 months) who had experienced an 01, unexplained fever, 50% fall in CD4 cells, 5% involuntary weight loss, or fall in Karnofsky score in the previous 12 weeks in A1454-010, a randomised trial comparing continued AZT (600 mg/day, 151 participants) versus ddl (750 mg/day later reduced to 600 mg/day, 160 participants). Switching to ddl was associated with a decreased incidence of primary endpoints (new AIDS-defining infections, two Ols and 50% drop in CD4 cells, wasting syndrome or death). The benefit of switching was consistent across sub-groups of participants with either ARC or AIDS and was most pronounced in participants with entry CD4 counts over 100. No benefit from switching was seen in participants with less than 12 months' prior AZT. When survival was used as the endpoint, no difference was noted between the two treatments. Tomino evaluated the relative benefits of continuing AZT versus switching to ddl (500 mg/day or 750 mg/day for body weights below or above 60 kg, respectively) in 133 people with AIDS who had already tolerated at least 6 months of AZT therapy (trial ISS-901). No significant difference in survival was observed between the groups. Switching to ddl seemed to delay the decrease in CD4 count. There was a lower number of discontinuations due to AIDS dementia complex in those who continued on AZT. Montaner (1994b) compared the efficacy and toxicity of ddl (334 mg/day or 500 mg/day for body weights below or above 60 kg, respectively) and continued AZT (600 mg/day) in 245 individuals with CD4 counts between 200-500 following at least 6 months of AZT treatment at 500 mg/day or more. 66% were asymptomatic, 30% had ARC and 4% had AIDS. Change to ddl led to a significantly increased probability of surviving free of an event that was sustained for at least 128 weeks. It also resulted in an early (less than 2 weeks), significant and persistent (at least 36 weeks) increase in CD4 count. Early change to ddl prevented in vitro resistance to AZT and often lead to a decrease in IC5so among AZT-resistant people. No new ddl-resistance was observed. De Wit published preliminary data from one randomized study suggesting that very low doses of ddl are not as effective as standard doses. 62 people who were intolerant to or failing on AZT were randomized to receive ddl (134 mg/day or 500 mg/day) in two divided doses. Survival was equivalent in the two groups, but significantly more people on the low dose reached an endpoint (45 versus 31). Endpoints included death, new 01, CD4 decline greater than 50% of baseline, and side-effects. 138 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 139](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/145?q1=directories) Shepp determined that among 21 people with advanced HIV disease treated with ddl, those whose viral titre decreased by fivefold or more (14 people, 67%) were more likely to achieve a 5% or greater increase in body weight and had a significantly greater mean increase in body weight during treatment months 1-5. Occurrence of new AIDS-defining illnesses and survival were not significantly different between groups. Changes in p24 antigenaemia did not correlate with any parameter of clinical outcome examined. He concluded that changing serum HIV titre is a marker of the virologic effect of ddl therapy that correlates with the early clinical benefit as reflected by weight gain, but correlation of this marker with long-term clinical benefit is uncertain. ddl for people with little or no prior AZT The relative efficacy of ddl compared to AZT for first-line treatment remains unclear. Dolin conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial (ACTG 1 16A) comparing two doses of ddl (sachet formulation) and AZT in 617 HIV-infected patients with less than 16 weeks prior AZT treatment. AIDS/ARC patients with CD4 counts below 300 and asymptomatic patients with CD4 counts below 200 were enrolled. Patients were stratified according to prior AZT exposure (0-8 weeks, or 8-16 weeks) and randomized to receive ddl 500 mg/day, ddl 750 mg/day, or AZT 600 mg/day. (Accrual into the low-dose ddl arm was terminated early to expedite enrolment. However, the analysis reviewed here only includes patients enrolled while all three arms remained open.) Median follow-up was 85 weeks. Among 380 patients with no prior exposure, AZT was determined to be more effective in terms of preventing new AIDS-defining conditions or death. 18% of AZT recipients, 31% of high-dose ddl recipients and 29% of low-dose ddl recipients developed a new AIDS-defining condition or died. Among 118 patients with 8-16 weeks' prior exposure to AZT, fewer patients in the ddl groups died or had a new AIDS-defining condition. 33% of AZT recipients, 17% of high-dose ddl recipients and 11% of low-dose ddl recipients developed a new AIDS-defining condition or died. Among 119 patients who had less than 8 weeks' prior AZT therapy, the investigators were unable to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of the treatments. Vella compared ddl (750 mg/day weight-adjusted, 180 participants) and AZT (12 mg/kg/day, 191 participants) in AZT-naive people with ARC with CD4 counts below 500 (trial ISS-902). Preliminary data suggest that CD4 response to treatment is comparable for the two drugs, with a consistent advantage for ddl, particularly in participants with baseline CD4 counts over 50. Use in combinations Collier enrolled 69 HIV-positive people with CD4 counts below 400 (median 259) and less than 120 days' prior use of AZT in a phase I, open-label, partially randomised pharmacokinetics trial of AZT and ddl. Participants received either the following total daily doses of AZT/ddl: (1) 150/90 600/0 mg. 37/55 completed at least 24 weeks on therapy. 58 completed to week 24, 3 withdrew from the study due to adverse events and 6 had dose modifications. Combination use did not alter the pharmacokinetics of either drug. The median increase in CD4 cell count was 166 for the AZT/ddl groups compared to 77 for the AZT alone group. The proportion experiencing a mean CD4 count increase of greater than 50% in groups 1-6 was 71%, 75%, 75%, 71%, 67% and 33% RNA titres in plasma decreased in 15 (83%) of 18 combination therapy recipients compared with 2/7 in the AZT monotherapy arm. Cases of peripheral neuropathy occurred in all groups except Group 4 (300/500 mg). Median CD4 count increases and weight gain were greater in participants without prior AZT therapy (83 vs. 24). Ragni enrolled 126 asymptomatic HIV-positive people (CD4 between 200 and 500) in ACTG 143, an open-label four-arm study of the combination of AZT and ddl. 38/126 participants were haemophiliacs. Participants were stratified according to prior AZT use and randomized to receive AZT 150 mg/day with ddl 134 mg/day combination), AZT 300 AZT combination), or ddl 500 mg/day alone. Toxicities have included 2 pancreatitis and 2 peripheral neuropathies (all on high-dose ddl), and 16 elevated LFTs (in all groups). CD4 response data show CD4 cell increases were sustained through 56 weeks in all arms of the study. The overall CD4 count was 342 at baseline and 398 at 56 weeks. CD4 counts remained above baseline in all groups. There were no significant differences in the magnitude of CD4 increases between groups. Yarchoan (1994) compared the toxicity and activity profiles of simultaneous and alternating regimens of AZT and ddl. 41 participants with AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection and CD4 counts below 350 who had less than 3 months of prior dideoxynucleoside therapy were randomly assigned to either (1) simultaneous AZT (300 mg/day) plus ddl (250 mg/day), or (2) AZT (600 mg/day) for 3 weeks alternating with ddl (500 mg/day) for 3 weeks. Simultaneous therapy resulted in greater increases in CD4 counts at every evaluation point through to week 45. In contrast CD4 counts in recipients of alternating therapy fell below baseline at week 27. Simultaneous therapy also resulted in higher peak weight gain. No significant differences were seen in p24 antigen or beta2-microglobulin levels. Toxicities from the two regimens were comparable, except for one death due to pancreatitis in the simultaneous therapy arm. The study was too small to draw conclusions about the clinical effects of the treatments. Mitsuya reported that recipients of simultaneous therapy in the above study had a greater reduction in viral load (measured using quantitative PCR) than the alternating arm during the first 2-3 months. RNA copy numbers remained below baseline at 1, 1.5 and 2 years, although there was no longer any significant difference between the arms. In 18 of 26 cases studied, participants developed the codon 215 mutation associated with AZT resistance, but only 1 person (4%) developed the codon 74 mutation associated with ddl resistance. Previous NCI studies found that 89% of people receiving ddl monotherapy developed this mutation, suggesting that the inclusion of AZT blocks or retards its emergence. Montaner (1994a) compared the efficacy of AZT plus ddl with that of AZT plus ddC in a partially randomized study which enrolled 136 people with CD4 counts between 50-350. Both regimes produced a significant rise in CD4 count, with a trend in favour of AZT plus ddl. Adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation have occurred in 26% and 20% of ddl and ddC treated participants respectively. Crumpacker presented in vitro findings at the FDA Combination Therapy meeting in November 1991 suggesting that low concentrations of ribavirin can markedly potentiate the anti-HIV activity of ddl in acutely-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in a chronically infected HIV cell line. Balzarini reported that this effect results from ribavirin stimulating the conversion of ddl to the active metabolite ddATP. De Clercq reported that ribavirin facilitates the action of dideoxyadenosine triphosphate (purportedly the active form of ddl) at the reverse transcriptase level. Japour reported that low concentrations of ribavirin enhance ddl activity, even in ddl-resistant isolates. Children The manufacturer reports that studies in pregnant rats using doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day and in rabbits using doses up to 600 mg/kg/day found no evidence of embryotoxicity, ftotoxicity or teratogenicity. Butler (1991) administered ddl (60, 120, 180, 360, or 540 mg/m2/day by mouth) for up to 97 weeks (median 42) to 89 children with symptomatic HIV infection. The median age at entry was 6.8 years and the median CD4 count at entry was 89. 39/89 had never received antiretroviral therapy. 12/89 patients died while on the study. Pancreatitis developed in 6 patients (all receiving ddl at does above 360 mg/m /day), asymptomatic peripheral retinal atrophy in 3, seizures in 2 and peripheral neuropathy in 2. Paired CD4 values at 0, 24 and 52 weeks were available for 35/89 patients. CD4 counts in this group rose significantly from a median 238 at baseline to 324 at 24 weeks, then declined to baseline by 52 weeks. CD4 improvements correlated with an entry CD4 count above 100, but not with dose or previous AZT treatment. The bioavailability of ddl was highly variable in these patients; mean absorption of an oral dose was 21% (range 5-89%). In two patients, no ddl was detected in the plasma after oral administration. The investigators suggested that this variability accounted for the non-dose-related effects of ddl on surrogate markers such as CD4 counts. Blanche conducted a single-centre, randomized, open-label trial comparing two dosages of ddl (120 vs 270 mg/m2/day) for at least 6 months in 34 HIV-positive children who had become resistant to or were intolerant of AZT. Serum levels of ddl 1 hour after administration were significantly different in the two groups and remained stable with time. There was a significant reduction in p24 antigenaemia and quantitative cellular viraemia with time but no difference between the two groups. The intensity of the biologic response, however, was significantly higher in the patients who had a baseline CD4 count above 50. No pancreatic or neurologic toxic effects were observed. In 5 children, 3 of whom had pre-existing liver disease, liver function abnormalities developed and one child died from unexplained hepatocellular failure, suggesting that ddl may be hepatotoxic. Husson enrolled 68 children (median age 7.2 years) in an open-label, non-randomized study was conducted to evaluate several different combinations of AZT and ddl. 54 participants had not received prior AZT (group 1) and 14 had experienced haematologic toxicity to AZT (group 2). Group 1 received one of eight regimens including AZT between 90-180 mg/m2 three times daily and ddl between 90-180 mg/m2 twice daily. Group 2 received one of three regimens including AZT 60 mg/m2 three times daily and ddl 90-180 mg/m2 twice daily. The regimens were equally well tolerated in both groups; toxicities included 3 pancreatitis, 4 anaemia (all in group 1), and 13 neutropenia. No children developed peripheral neuropathy. Significant CD4 increases were observed overall; the greatest increases were observed in group 1, in whom the mean CD4 count increased from 386 to 726 at six months. Resistance Hitchcock reported that clinically derived HIV isolates with as high as 30-fold decreases in susceptibility to ddl in vitro have been described. However, in studies designed to assess the frequency of resistance development after prolonged ddl therapy, more moderate changes (2- to 5-fold) are seen in A-Z OF TREATMENTS 139 [Page 140](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/146?q1=directories) general. By contrast, isolates with a 1 00-fold decrease in sensitivity to AZT are frequently found in strains from patients who have received prolonged AZT therapy. Reichman reported the development of in vitro resistance to ddl in 15 patients (14 ARC, 1 AIDS) treated with ddl for a median of 56 weeks. 12/15 had previously received AZT for a median of 36 weeks. The median concentration of ddl required to inhibit these patients' viral isolates before treatment was 7 pM, increasing to a median 13 pM after treatment. Decreased susceptibility to ddl was observed as soon as 6 months and as late as 30 months after initiation of ddl therapy. These decreases in ddl sensitivity were accompanied by increasing sensitivity to AZT. Additional isolates were obtained from 4 patients who received ddl monotherapy for 2 years. Three of these isolates demonstrated no change in ddl sensitivity compared to baseline. No correlation could be made in this study between development of decreased ddl sensitivity and serum p24 levels, CD4 counts, or clinical outcome. Pepin reported that 2/13 isolates from AZT intolerant participants in the Alpha trial had reduced susceptibility to ddl after 6 months of ddl therapy. 8/13 isolates were AZT-resistant; 4 reverted to AZT-sensitive phenotypes but 4 remained AZT resistant after discontinuing AZT for 7-8 months. 1 isolate with reduced susceptibility to ddl also remained AZT-resistant 14 months after discontinuation of AZT. St Clair isolated HIV strains from sequential samples taken from 5 patients with advanced HIV disease who had been treated with AZT for at least 12 months but had changed to ddl treatment when they began to deteriorate clinically. HIV isolates recovered from PBMCs by co-cultivation with donor PBMCs all initially had reduced sensitivity to AZT. Within 6-12 months of discontinuing AZT, the isolates had become substantially more sensitive to AZT, while also developing a 6-26 fold decrease in sensitivity to ddl. The mechanism of resistance to ddl appeared to be a mutation in codon 74 in the reverse transcriptase coding region, which counteracted the effect of the most commonly seen AZT resistance-conferring mutation, at codon 215. D'Aquila (1992) reported that a higher level of ddl resistance was caused by interaction between AZT- and ddl-resistance mutations in the RT gene. Clinical progression was associated with a ddl-resistance mutation at codon 74 in an already AZT-resistant, but not in an AZT-sensitive, RT, suggesting that initial ddl and follow-up AZT therapy may be less prone to resistance development than initial AZT and follow-up ddl. Wainberg presented preliminary data from an ongoing randomized study comparing ddl and AZT in 223 patients with CD4 count between 200 - 500 who had at least six months prior treatment with AZT. The primary endpoint of the study is the development of in vitro resistance to ddl or AZT. ddl-resistant virus developed infrequently in the first year of therapy among patients randomized to ddl. Among the patients randomized to continue AZT, 60% had AZT-resistant virus after one year. Smith described the isolation of AZT-resistant virus from 4 individuals who had previously received AZT and were receiving ddl in ACTG protocols 117 and 118. PCR was performed on plasma culture DNA from these patients at several time points between 5 - 22 months. The major AZT-resistance mutation (codon 215 of the reverse transcriptase) was detected in all samples from all patients. The major ddl-resistance mutation (codon 74) developed in one patient. Schafer reported that the combination of ddl and AZT does not prevent the emergence of AZT-resistant mutants in vivo. In the study ACTG 143, resistance to AZT emerged with equal frequency in participants receiving AZT plus ddl as in those receiving AZT monotherapy. ddl resistance emerged in 2 participants receiving AZT plus ddl, and none receiving ddl monotherapy. Resistance to both drugs emerged in two people receiving the combination therapy. This is in contrast with the finding of Antonelli that the combination does prevent resistance in vitro. Side-effects Pancreatitis and peripheral neuropathy are the most serious toxicities of ddl. Peripheral neuropathy requiring drug discontinuation occurred in 22% of the phase 1/11 clinical trial participants and 16% of the expanded-access participants. Neuropathy has been associated with daily ddl doses above 12.5 mg/kg and cumulative ddl doses above 1.5 g/kg and especially with a prior history of peripheral neuropathy or concurrent treatment with vincristine. Most cases are mild and resolve upon cessation of the drug; some people are able to tolerate reintroduction of ddl at lower doses without significant recurrence of the neuropathic symptoms. Chen suggested that ddl-related neuropathy could be a consequence of inhibition of mitochondrial DNA by ddl. Pancreatitis has been reported in about 17% of the phase 1/11 clinical-trial participants and about 5% of the expanded-access participants. In ACTG 116B/11 7, the risk of pancreatitis was dose-related, occurring in 10% of patients taking ddl 750 mg/day and 6% of patients taking ddl 500 mg/day. Pancreatitis was also found to be dose related in the Alpha study. The single greatest risk factor for developing pancreatitis is a prior history of pancreatitis. Other risk factors include abnormal liver function tests and abnormal renal function. Serum amylase levels at baseline are not strongly correlated with subsequent development of pancreatitis. Nausea and abdominal pain warrant cessation of treatment pending evaluation. The risk of pancreatitis with ddl therapy may be increased by the concomitant use of drugs which reduce stomach acidity and increase ddl absorption, such as H2 blockers and omeprazole, as well as other pancreatotoxic drugs including, possibly, co-trimoxazole (e.g. Jost). Seidlin reported that ddl-related pancreatitis is associated with cumulative dose; people who develop pancreatitis may be able to tolerate therapy with a lower dose after resolution of their symptoms. Butler (1993) reported that among 95 ddl-treated children, pancreatitis developed in 7 (7%) but resolved in all upon withdrawal of ddl. Neither age, sex, nor CD4 count at study entry was predictive of pancreatitis, but pancreatitis appeared more likely to develop in hamophiliacs than in other patients (4/23 vs 3/72). Pancreatitis developed only in patients who received ddl at doses of at least 360 mg/m /day. No relationship with the cumulative dose or the duration of ddl therapy was observed. Diarrhoea requiring dose modification occurred in about 29% of phase 1/11 participants and 16% of expanded-access participants, all of whom were receiving a sachet formulation of ddl. It is not known if the chewable tablet formulation currently marketed is associated with the same rates of diarrhoea. Hyperuricaemia has been clearly associated with doses above 20 mg/kg/day. Other infrequent adverse effects which may be attributable to ddl include anaemia or leukopenia and seizures. ddl may be associated with a very low rate of liver failure. Lai described an individual in a phase I trial of ddl (12 mg/kg/day) who died of fulminant liver failure. On autopsy, the patient's liver was enlarged with cholestasis and fatty change. The manufacturer has since analyzed a database of more than 45,000 ddl users and found reports of 163 patients who died with serious liver dysfunction. Whether these cases are related to ddl therapy is not known. Retinal lesions have been observed in children receiving ddl. Whitcup reported that these lesions appear as mottling and atrophy of the retinal-pigment epithelium and progress while ddl therapy continues. Progression stops upon cessation of ddl. Lesions are located in the mid-periphery of the fundus and may be missed upon examination by direct ophthalmoscope through undilated pupils. Therefore, the investigators suggest that all children receiving ddl be examined by indirect ophthalmoscopy through dilated pupils every four to six months. Blanche reported that of 34 children treated with intravenous ddl, 5 developed liver function abnormalities and one child died from unexplained hepatocellular failure, suggesting that ddl may be hepatotoxic. 3/5 of these children had pre-existing liver disease.

Pentoxifylline (Trental) enhances the antiretroviral activity of didanosine non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase - the family of anti-HIV drugs to which L-697,661 and nevirapine also belong. These drugs act by inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme, but in a different way from the nucleoside analogue drugs like AZT, ddC and ddl. In test-tube studies, delavirdine inhibits HIV-1, but has no activity against HIV-2 or animal retroviruses such as FeLV or SIV. It is equally effective against AZT-sensitive and AZT-resistant strains of HIV-1. It is said to be between 50 and 100 times more effective than the related drug atevirdine. In September 1992 it was reported that delavirdine could kill HIV in cell culture - the first time this had been observed with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Delavirdine belongs to the BHAP class of compounds and is also known as delavirdine mesylate, by the abbreviation DLV and by the code-name U-901 52S. It is manufactured by Upjohn. Current use Delavirdine is an unlicensed, experimental drug. It is currently being developed for use in combination with AZT or AZT and other drugs, and as monotherapy for people who are intolerant of or have failed standard therapies. The results of two small Phase II trials have been reported. One found that the triple-drug combination of AZT, ddl and delavirdine produced greater increases in CD4 count and decline in p24 antigen levels than the two-drug combination of delavirdine plus AZT.The three drugs also had a greater effect on levels of HIV in the blood. Trial participants had already taken AZT for an average of 17 months, and some had also taken ddl before; those who previous experience of both drugs were less likely to respond to the triple combination. A-Z OF TREATMENTS 141 [Page 142](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/148?q1=directories) A second Phase II study suggested that people who switched from AZT to delavirdine were more likely to develop HIV strains that were resistant to delavirdine if they had already also developed resistance to AZT. Two studies of the combination of delavirdine with nucleoside anti-HIV drugs are underway at various HIV centres in the UK. Reported side-effects of delavirdine include rash, mild-to-moderate fatigue, leg cramps, fever, palpitations and reversible liver abnormalities. The development of HIV strains that are resistant to delavirdine has been reported. In vitro these resistant strains are highly susceptible to nevirapine. Drug interactions Levels of delavirdine in the blood appear to be reduced by concomitant rifabutin. Delavirdine levels are also significantly reduced when ddl is taken at the same time, but not when ddl is taken one hour after delavirdine. This effect is probably caused by ddl's antacid buffer; delavirdine should not be taken at the same time as other drugs that reduce stomach acidity. To ensure proper absorption of delavirdine it should be taken on an empty stomach. Key research Dueweke reported that delavirdine blocked the replication in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 25 primary HIV-1 isolates, including variants that were highly resistant to AZT or ddl, with a mean 50% effective dose of 0.066 +/0.137 pM. Delavirdine had low cellular cytotoxicity, causing less than 8% reduction in peripheral blood lymphocyte viability at 100 pM. In experiments assessing inhibition of the spread of HIV-1 IIIB in cell cultures, delavirdine was much more effective than AZT. The combination of delavirdine and AZT, each at 0.5 pM, also totally prevented viral spread. Chong reported that delavirdine inhibits HIV-1 in vitro at lower concentrations than atevirdine and is synergistic in combination with ddC and AZT. Batts treated 30 HIV-positive people with delavirdine (400, 600, 800, 900 or 1200 mg/day) in combination with AZT (600 mg/day) for 12 weeks. The commonest adverse events were headaches and rash. Doses of at least 600 mg produced median steady state trough levels of greater than 1 pM. Freimuth reported the results of two Phase II studies. The first, sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health, consisted of four arms: the triple-drug combination of AZT, ddl and delavirdine (400, 600, 800, 1000 or 1200 mg/day); AZT plus ddl; AZT plus delavirdine (400 mg three times/day); delavirdine alone (400 mg three times daily). A total of 67 participants with CD4 counts between 100-300 were enrolled. The most common adverse events were maculopapular skin rash (approximately 33%) and headache, which were not dose-limiting. 59% of triple combination recipients experienced a CD4 count increase of 25% or 50 cells, compared to 29% of those receiving only AZT plus ddl. Triple combination recipients were also more likely to experience at least a five-fold decrease in HIV branched DNA (44% versus 13%), a 1-log reduction in plasma viraemia (77% versus 25%) and at least a 50% decrease in acid-dissociated p24 antigen levels (59% verus 0%). Trial participants had an average of 17 months prior AZT, and some had also taken ddl before; those who previous experience of both drugs were less likely to respond to the triple combination. The second study reported by Freimuth, sponsored by Upjohn, treated 34 people who had CD4 counts between 200-500 and at least 6 weeks prior AZT therapy with delavirdine at doses of 400, 600, 800, 900 or 1200 mg/day. 50% experienced a CD4 count increase of 25% or 50 cells. In contrast with studies of other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 20% of participants had no change in viral susceptibility to delavirdine inthe first 32 weeks of the trial. In the majority of participants who did have reduced susceptibility, ICso values were reported to be lower than trough levels of delavirdine achieved inthe blood. 100-fold decreased viral susceptibility to delavirdine was associated with baseline AZT resistance and/or SI phenotype. In both studies the drug was well-tolerated, with approximately 95% of participants completing the studies. References Batts DH et al.

Morse GD SDextran sulphate Dextran sulphate is a drug that was developed as an anticoagulant to delay clotting of blood in people who had heart disease or strokes. It has been used orally in Japan and intravenously in Britain as a treatment for hyperlipidaemia (excess fat in the blood). Coincidentally, it was also found to prevent the formation of syncytia in the test-tube. Syncytia are clumps of T-cells which form when uninfected cells gather around one or more HIV-infected cell. Current use Because it was available over the counter in Japan, orally-taken dextran sulphate was a popular underground drug in the USA. Two formal trials found that very little dextran sulphate was absorbed into the body orally and the drug therefore had no effect against HIV (except possibly in the gut). Researchers therefore tested an intravenous version of the drug. However, no antiviral effects were seen; if anything, p24 antigen levels increased. The drug also caused serious thrombocytopenia, a shortage of platelets in the blood which can cause potentially fatal bleeding problems. No further trials of dextran sulphate appear to be underway and there are no reports of 'underground' use of the drug. Other drugs which belong to the same chemical family as dextran sulphate, anti-HIV activity in two T-lymphocyte cell lines was reported by Ueno and confirmed by Mitsuya. Abrams conducted a phase I trial of oral dextran sulphate in people with AIDS/ARC followed by an ACTG phase 1/11 trial. Laboratory study indicated the drug was poorly absorbed and no overall antiviral effect or improvement in immune function was observed. A study by Lorentsen comparing oral with IV administration further supported the findings of Abrams. Hiebert, however, reported that after oral dosing (4 g/day for 5 days), dextran sulphate could be found in plasma and in 7/20 lymphocyte samples. When dextran sulphate was administered orally to HIV-positive persons (1 g four times daily) for up to 4 months, the drug was detected in plasma, lymphocytes and urine when examined at monthly intervals. 142 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 143](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/149?q1=directories) Flexner administered the maximally tolerated dose of dextran sulphate by continuous intravenous infusion to 10 people with symptomatic HIV infection for up to 14 days. Drug concentrations were up to 200-fold greater than the ICso for free HIV infectivity in vitro. Circulating p24 antigen levels increased in 8/8 people treated for longer than 3 days (median proportional increase 73.5%; range 32-130%). This increase was highly significant when compared with a large cohort of untreated historical controls. Continuous intravenous infusion was toxic, producing profound but reversible thrombocytopenia in 8/8 people treated for longer than 3 days and extensive but reversible alopecia in 5/8.

It is a licensed drug in Italy and Japan for the treatment of menopause and depression. Studies have shown that in people with HIV, natural DHEA levels tend to decline as the disease progresses. This may indicate that DHEA inhibits HIV, or simply reflect HIV's damage to the adrenal gland. Test-tube studies have found that DHEA has a moderate anti-HIV effect and may inhibit HIV infection of macrophages or HIV production from infected macrophages. Tests in animals indicate that it may restrain auto-immune responses. DHEA is also known by its full chemical name dihydroepiandrosterone or dehydroisoandrosterone, or the tradename EL- 10. Current use DHEA is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Clinical trials have failed to show any benefits so far, but further studies with higher doses are under way. No significant side-effects have been reported to date. Use in combination One test-tube study found that DHEA was antagonistic to AZT i.e. it lessens the drug's anti-HIV effects. However, the manufacturer reports that their in vitro tests showed that DHEA and AZT are synergistic. Getting it DHEA is manufactured by Cothurst Ltd who are based in County Kildare in Ireland and up-to-date information on access to the drug may be available from Dublin groups for people with HIV. Key research Sonnabend and Merril reported that DHEA levels are lower in HIV-infected individuals than in healthy HIV-negative people. Jacobson and Mulder described an association between HIV disease progression and decreased levels of DHEA in HIV-infected men with CD4 counts between 200 and 500. This may indicate that DHEA has an inhibitory effect on HIV; or DHEA levels may simply be a marker reflecting HIV-induced damage to the adrenal glands. In vitro studies of DHEA in HIV-infected lymphocytes and macrophages demonstrated a moderately selective inhibitory effect on HIV replication. The exact mechanism of action is unclear. In vitro, the combination of DHEA and AZT is antagonistic. Henderson reported that treatment with DHEA or its novel synthetic analogues 8354 or OH8356 resulted in a modest down-regulation of HIV-1 replication in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes as measured by syncytia formation, release of p24 antigen and accumulation of reverse transcriptase activity. DHEA and also reduced 250-600) in an open-label dose-ranging trial of DHEA (three times daily in doses ranging from 750 mg/day to 2250 mg/day for 16 weeks). The drug was well tolerated and no dose-limiting side-effects were noted. Dose proportionality was evidenced neither by the serum DHEA nor by DHEA-S time-concentration curves for the three dosing groups. However, the study cohort appeared to consist of two subpopulations with markedly different bioavailability for a given DHEA dose. No sustained improvements in CD4 counts nor decreases in serum p24 antigen or beta2-microglobulin levels were observed. However, serum neopterin levels decreased transiently by 23-40% at week 8 compared with baseline in all dosing groups. At the Community Research Initiative (CRI) in New York, 10 people with AIDS completed a 16-week phase I toxicity study of DHEA (1 gm by mouth once daily). Neither side-effects nor clinical improvement was observed. References Inhibition of HIV- latency reactivation by DHEA and an Res Hum Retroviruses 9(8):747-754, 1993. Dyner TS et al.

Small, uncontrolled studies reported some success in treating people with isosporiasis and contradictory results in treating cryptosporidiosis. The only controlled study suggested that diclazuril did have some efficacy against cryptosporidiosis. Trials have suggested that diclazuril is absorbed slowly and reaches relatively low levels in the blood. Research therefore switched to letrazuril, a closely related drug that is better absorbed, but its development has recently been discontinued by its manufacturer Janssen. * DNCB DNCB is an organic compound used in.colour photography. It comes in crystal form or pre-dissolved in A-Z OF TREATMENTS 143 [Page 144](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/150?q1=directories) solvent. In the early 1970s it was discovered that applying DNCB to verrucas (wart virus lesions) caused them to heal. In 1984 researchers found that DNCB applied to the skin of the shoulders resulted in improvement in warts elsewhere in the body in three-quarters of affected people. As well as this apparent antiviral effect, DNCB may help to correct autoimmune problems such as alopecia (hair loss) and seems to have some anti-tumour effects when applied to skin cancers. One theory suggests that when first applied, DNCB is absorbed through the skin and, after binding to a protein, is eventually presented to CD4 lymphocytes in the lymph nodes. This is thought to activate CD4 cells causing an immune reaction at the initial site of application. Subsequent applications are thought to activate memory T lymphocytes which in turn activate cellular immune responses throughout the body, such as CD8 (cytotoxic) T-lymphocytes. DNCB is an abbreviation for dinitrochlorobenzene. The full chemical name of DNCB is 1 -chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (C6H3CIN204). Current use DNCB is an unlicensed, experimental treatment. It has been a relatively popular 'underground' treatment for many years. A small open study in people with HIV in San Francisco suggested that DNCB improved T-cell function and resulted in improvements in KS lesions. There are anecdotal reports that it may also be an effective treatment for molluscum contagiosum. DNCB can cause quite painful itchy lesions or burns to the skin. There has been one report of a serious allergic skin reaction to the substance which resulted in total body blistering and subsequent blood infection which required prolonged hospitalisation. DNCB should only ever be used topically (externally) and not internally. Using it DNCB dissolved in solvent is usually applied to a two-inch round circle area of skin on the underside of the lower forearm or the inside of the upper arm with a cotton-tipped swab. The first application should consist of a 10% solution (12 grams of DNCB crystals dissolved in 1/2 cup acetone). After a period of time this should be washed off. This is called the sensitising application, which is thought to allow T-lymphocytes to recognise the DNCB and circulate throughout the body. No sooner than one month later, a 2% (2.4 grams in 1/2 cup) should be applied to the same place; the skin should redden slightly to moderately with an itching or burning sensation. This shows that sensitisation has succeeded. Thereafter, weekly treatment can begin, applying the solution to different sites e.g. arms, legs, trunk. If blistering or weeping occurs, reduce the strength of the solution to 0.2% (0.24 grams per 1/2 cup) or 0.02% (0.024 grams per 1/2 cup). Try to maintain regular weekly applications, as unusually strong reactions may result if longer intervals are left between treatment. DNCB solution should be stored in airtight amber bottles - not plastic containers. If the container is not airtight acetone will evaporate, leaving a stronger solution that may burn. DNCB users recommend avoiding excess sun or any type of ultraviolet light as this is said to suppress the treatment effect. Getting it 99% pure DNCB crystals can be bought from some photographic chemical suppliers or from US buyers' clubs such as the Healing Alternatives Foundation. DNCB is not available through the NHS. Key research Mills treated HIV-positive individuals with DNCB in an open study. Improvements in T-cell fuction were observed in 6 participants with AIDS. In participants with KS, mucocutaneous lesions were reduced in size, thickness, number and colour. Stricker (1993a) observed 10 HIV-positive people (4 asymptomatic, 3 with ARC, 3 diagnosed with AIDS for at least 4 years) who used DNCB for 3 to 6 years. The most common dose was 2% DNCB applied weekly or biweekly. Stricker (1993b) reported that in a pilot study DNCB application was associated with an increase in CD8 cells and natural killer cells and a decrease in viral load in HIV-positive people, who remained clinically stable for up to 27 months.

Pilot study of topical dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) in human SDoxorubicin Doxorubicin is an approved intravenous anti-cancer drug which has significant side-effects. It is thought to act by binding to DNA and inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. It is active, alone or in combination, against a wide spectrum of tumours and is being used experimentally in combination with other drugs as a treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma. The most common side-effect that requires recipients to reduce the dose or stop taking the drug is blood abnormalities - usually leukopenia - but other side-effects can include cardiac (heart) toxicity (usually when the cumulative dose exceeds 550 mg/m2), hair loss, nausea, vomiting and oral ulcers. Researchers have developed an experimental intravenous formulation of doxorubicin in which the drug has been encased in fatty particles called liposomes. This liposomal doxorubicin seems to be better targetted to tumour cells (as opposed to healthy cells) and so may be more effective with fewer side-effects. It is being tested on as a treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma. Side-effects of liposomal doxorubicin can include stomatitis, hair loss, nausea, and blood toxicities. One case of fatal liver failure in a person with a history of symptom-free hepatitis B was attributed to liposomal doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is also known as doxorubicin hydrochloride. It is manufactured by Pharmacia, and was formerly known by the tradename Adriamycin. * Dronabinol Dronabinol is a drug that is approved in the United States to stimulate the appetite and reduce weight loss in people 144 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 145](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/151?q1=directories) with HIV. It is also approved in the USA for reducing the nausea and vomiting that can be caused by cancer chemotherapy. It is not approved in the UK. It is a synthetically manufactured version of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active substance in marijuana. The most frequent side-effects are drowsiness, muddled thinking and impaired coordination. It is sold in the USA under the tradename Marinol. SErythropoietin Erythropoietin is a natural hormone-like substance found in the body that stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. It is now mass-produced using recombinant genetic engineering techniques and is used as an injectable treatment for anaemia (shortage of red blood cells). In people with HIV it is most commonly used to alleviate the anaemia that can be caused by AZT. No significant side-effects have been seen in people with HIV. Erythropoietin is sometimes abbreviated to EPO and is also known as Epoetin alpha or beta - the two forms have exactly the same effects. In the UK it is marketed by Cilag under the tradename Eprex and by Boehringer Mannheim under the tradename Recormon. In the United States it is also known by the tradenames Epogen and Procrit. * Ethambutol Ethambutol is an approved anti-mycobacterial antibiotic used in combination with other drugs for treating tuberculosis. It is also being tested in combination with other drugs as a treatment for MAI. It comes in the form of tablets. Its side-effects can include optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve), decreased or distorted vision, rash and fever. People who develop sight abnormalities while taking ethambutol should stop taking the drug immediately and contact their doctor urgently. Ethambutol is also known as ethambutol hydrochloride, and is manufactured by Lederle under the tradenames Myambutol and Mynah. * Ethionamide Ethionamide is an anti-leprosy drug that is used in the United States in combination with other drugs for treating multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. It is not marketed in the UK. Frequent side-effects include weight loss, nausea and vomiting and a metallic taste. Hepatitis can also occur. Its American tradename is Trecator. * Etoposide Etoposide is an approved anti-cancer drug which is used for treating a range of cancers including small cell carcinoma, lymphoma and testicular teratoma. It is being tested as a treatment for Kaposis sarcoma; initial studies have found no clear evidence of efficay. It comes either in tablet form or as a liquid for intravenous injection; the oral dose is usually double the injected dose. Nausea, vomiting and mouth ulcers occur especially often when it is taken in tablet-form, and hair loss occurs frequently with both intravenous and oral administration. The most common side-effect requiring the dose to be reduced or treatment stopped is leukopenia. Etoposide is manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the tradename Vepeside. It is also sometimes referred to by the abbreviation VP-16. * Extracorporeal photopheresis Extracorporeal photopheresis is a process in which blood is drawn from a patient who has been given a 8-methoxypsoralen, a light-activated photosensitizing drug which is thought to bind to DNA. The red and white blood cells are separated and the white cells are passed through a sterile chamber and irradiated with ultra-violet (UV) light, then returned to the body. Approximately one-third of the individual's white blood cells are treated in this way. It is unclear why this might be beneficial for people with HIV. It is thought that the process may cause the drug to bind to and inactivate HIV. The treatment may also damage HIV-infected cells, making it easier for the immune system to recognise and respond to viral proteins. Current use Extracorporeal photopheresis is an approved treatment in the USA for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a tumour of the CD4 cells, and is used at some British specialist centres as a treatment for some people with psoriasis (in which cases the drug is obtained on a named patient basis). As an HIV treatment, it is an unlicensed, experimental procedure. It has been studied in small uncontrolled trials among people with ARC. No clear effects on markers such as CD4 count or antibody levels were seen, although several participants reported improvements in mild symptoms such as lymphadenopathy were reported. No side-effects were seen. Ultra-violet irradiation can have side-effects including burning, development of eye cataracts, accelerated aging and the development of skin cancer. UV light has also been shown to stimulate HIV replication in test-tube studies. No studies of extracorporeal photopheresis are taking place in Britain and the treatment is not known to be available to people with HIV through other means. Key research Bisaccia (1990) enrolled 5 early ARC patients with lymphadenopathy in a pilot phase I study of monthly extracorporeal photopheresis. No participants had ever received therapy for HIV. All patients received at least 5 monthly treatments; some have received up to 15 months' treatment. Lymphadenopathy, fever and night sweats disappeared in all patients by the third month of treatment and remained absent for the length of the trial. CD4 count increased in two patients, stabilised in two patients and decreased in one patient after six months' treatment. Weight remained stable or increased in 4 patients and decreased in one. p24- and A-Z OF TREATMENTS 145 [Page 146](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/152?q1=directories) gpl20-antibody levels increased in all patients. 4 patients reported increased energy levels and improved quality of life. Bisaccia (1993) enrolled 15 people with ARC in a Phase II study of extracorporeal photopheresis. Decreased lymphadenopathy was again seen, although the average CD4 count fell from 401 to 325 and average CD4 percentage decreased from 30% to 27%. Beta2-microglobulin rose from approximately 2.10 to 2.83. As in the previous study, response to skin tests improved, returning to normal in eight patients. No toxicity was observed. 3 of these patients, plus 17 additional patients, were treated with monthly extracorporeal photopheresis. 16/19 remained clinically stable over a longer period (range 6 to 29 months). Beta2-microglobulin and neopterin levels and levels of antibodies to HIV proteins remained stable. Skin test responsivity improved in 11, remained unchanged in 7 and declined in 2 participants.

SFamciclovir Famciclovir is an anti-herpes drug that is approved in the UK for the treatment of shingles (varicella zoster virus). It is also active against herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 in the test-tube, and is being studied as an treatment to acyclovir. Famciclovir was derived from another anti-herpes drug, penciclovir, which was not well absorbed when taken in tablet form. Famciclovir is well-absorbed by mouth. No side-effects have been reported in humans, although in laboratory tests an increased incidence of breast tumours was seen in female rats given high doses for the duration of their lives. An independent review committee concluded that humans are not considered at increased risk of breast tumours as a result of taking famciclovir. Famciclovir is manufactured by Smith-Kline Beecham. It was formerly known by the codename BRL39123A. * Flourouracil Flourouracil is an approved anti-cancer drug that works by preventing normal cell division. In its intravenous formulation it is used to treat a number of tumours including breast cancer and cancer of the colon. It also comes as a cream which can be used to treat cervical, anal or genital neoplasms caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Side-effects of the cream include burning, inflammation and discoloration of the skin. Flourouracil is also known as 5-flourouracil, or the abbreviation 5-FU. It is available in a generic formulation and is also manufactured by Roche under the tradename Efudix. SFLT Like AZT, ddl and ddC, FLT is a modified form of one of the building blocks of DNA (known as nucleosides). When HIV replicates in the presence of these nucleoside analogue drugs, the virus' reverse transcriptase enzyme incorporates the drug in the place of a normal nucleoside in the growing DNA strand. This prevents the proper assembly of viral genetic material and halts viral replication. FLT is an abbreviation for the chemical name fluorothymidine. The drug is manufactured by Lederle. Current use FLT is an unlicensed, experimental drug. In a phase 1 trial it decreased levels of detectable HIV in the blood of people with ARC or AIDS. However, it also had significant side-effects, causing serious shortages of white blood cells, platelets and haemoglobin. Further studies were stopped when 2 participants died of liver failure. It is not yet clear whether this was caused by the drug. Key research Matthes found that FLT was more readily phosphorylated than AZT to a triphosphate form and confirmed FLT's ability to protect MT-4 cells from the cytopathic effects of HIV. Polsky reported that of 14 people with ARC or AIDS enrolled in a phase I dose-ranging study of multiple oral doses of FLT, 11 were followed long enough to assess changes in one or more quantitative laboratory measures of antiretroviral activity. 7/11 (64%) had a significant (greater than 8-fold) decrease in HIV-1 titre isolated from PBMC and/or plasma. 6/7 participants with baseline p24 antigen levels of above 60 pg/mL had a greater than 50% reduction in antigenaemia. However, dose-escalation was halted when haematologic toxicity (significant decreases in haemoglobin, white blood cells and/or platelet count) was observed in 11/12 participants at the first dose level (0.25 mg/kg daily). Phase I multi-centre concentration-control studies were halted when two patients died from acute liver failure while being treated. It is not clear whether the deaths were drug-related. An investigation is underway and further clinical development is on hold. References Barditch-Crovo PA et al.

It works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a main component in the fungal cell membrane. By depleting ergosterol it makes make the cell membrane more fluid, reducing the activity of fungal enzymes and inhibitiing cell growth and replication. Fluconazole is very well absorbed in the body, reaching high concentrations not only in the blood but also in body tissues, the cerebrospinal fluid and urine. Fluconazole is manufactured by Pfizer under the tradename Diflucan. Current use Fluconazole is licensed for treating candidiasis cryptococcal meningitis, and for preventing recurrences of cryptococcal meningitis after treatment. It is also being tested as a treatment or prophylaxis for other fungal diseases such as aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis. Fluconazole with flucytosine 146 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 147](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/153?q1=directories) has shown some promise as a treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Studies such as ACTG 981 suggest that taking fluconazole regularly can help to prevent a range of fungal infections, especially cryptococcal infections, although it may not prolong overall survival. A growing number of treatment failures are being seen among people with HIV who are receiving intermittent or continuous fluconazole for candidiasis. This seems to be due to the emergence of strains of candida that are resistant to fluconazole. In these cases alternative antifungal drugs such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may be used. Side-effects Fluconazole has fewer side-effects than alternative treatments such as itraconazole or ketoconazole. The commonest problem is an upset stomach which is more likely the higher the dose, but is still sufficiently uncommon that people taking doses up to 400 mg/day rarely have to discontinue treatment. Fluconazole can also rarely cause clinically important, even fatal hepatitis - liver function should therefore be monitored. Skin rashes have also been reported, primarily in people taking fluconazole at the same time as several other drugs. Other occasional side-effects include nausea and vomiting, headache, seizures and the potentially fatal Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Taking it Fluconazole comes in the form of capsules, a liquid for intravenous infusion or a solution to be drunk. Its absorption into the body is not affected by presence of food or the acidity of the stomach. People who are starting fluconazole treatment are usually recommended to start off with a higher loading dose before settling down to the standard dose. The dose of fluconazole should be reduced in people who have kidney impairment. Drug interactions People who are also taking the anti-mycobacterial drug rifampin may have reduced blood levels of fluconazole. Taking fluconazole at the same time as the anti-MAl rifabutin increases blood levels of rifabutin and may be associated with an increased risk of rifabutin side-effects such as uveitis. Fluconazole can also increase blood levels of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin, phenytoin (an anti-convulsant), sulphonylurea drugs used for treating diabetes (especially tolbutamide) and the anti-coagulant warfarin that is sometimes presribed to people with heart disease. Key research Powderly reported that ACTG 981 demonstrated that fluconazole (200 mg/day) was successful in primary prophylaxis of invasive and superficial fungal infections in people with CD4 counts below 200. The benefit was largely due to a reduction in cryptococcosis. There was no reduction in mortality. References Como JA et al. Oral azole drugs as systemic NEJM 330(4):263-272, 1994. Powderly Prophylaxis of fungal in HIV infection. 34th ICAAC, Orlando, oral presentation 1(1), 1994. * Flucytosine Flucytosine is one of the older antifungal drugs. It is sometimes used alongside amphotericin B for treating severe candidiasis, cryptococcal menigitis or other severe fungal infections. It is also being tested in combination with the newer antifungals fluconazole and itraconazole. Side-effects can include nausea and vomiting in about 5% of recipients, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, rash, elevated liver enzymes, anaemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, confusion and headache. Flucytosine is sometimes referred to by the abbreviation 5-FU. It is manufactured by Roche under the tradename Ancobon. * Folate Supplements of folate are already prescribed to many symptomatic HIV-positive people due to deficiencies caused by a range of treatment drugs and by malabsorption in the intestine. Folate deficiency is also common in smokers. Serious deficiency can lead to platelet disorders and a decrease in white blood cells. Good food sources are green leafy vegetables, oranges, beans, liver, rice and brewer's yeast. Folate is also known as folinic acid. * Folinic acid Folinic acid is an approved drug used to protect against the side-effects of folate antagonist drugs such as trimetrexate. Cells that absorb folinic acid are protected against trimetrexate, while those that do not absorb folinic acid can be seriously damaged by trimetrexate. Since foilinic acid is taken up by human cells but not by, for example, Pneumocystis carinii organisms, the combination of folinic acid with trimetrexate allows the effects of the trimetrexate to be targetted against Pneumocystis. Folinic acid needs to be continued for 72 hours after the last dose of trimetrexate to ensure adequate protection. Without folinic acid, trimetrexate can cause serious bone marrow suppression and kidney and/or liver damage. The drug comes in the form of tablets or a liquid for intravenous injection. Folinic acid is also known as leucovorin, calcium leucovorin or calcium folinate. It is available as a generic (non-brandname) product and is also manufactured by Pharmacia under the tradename Refolinon. * Foscarnet Foscarnet is a broad spectrum anti-herpes drug. It works by inhibiting the DNA polymerases of the herpes viruses. It has A-Z OF TREATMENTS 147 [Page 148](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/154?q1=directories) also been found to inhibit HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme in vitro. Foscarnet is sometimes referred to as foscarnet sodium, trisodium phosphonoformate, PFA or by its tradename Foscavir. It is manufactured by Astra Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Current use Foscarnet was licensed in September 1991 for treating cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. Comparative studies have shown that it is as effective as the other approved anti-CMV drug ganciclovir. It is also active against ganciclovir-resistant strains of CMV. There is little clearcut evidence on the development of foscarnet-resistant strains of CMV. Foscarnet is currently being tested as a treatment for CMV colitis and acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex and herpes zoster infections. Despite its anti-HIV activity it is not currently used specifically as an anti-HIV treatment. It is thought to be an impractical drug for the long-term use that is likely to be required of an anti-HIV agent because it has to be given by intravenous infusion and causes substantial side-effects. Some studies have suggested that foscarnet does reduce levels of HIV's p24 antigen, suggesting that it is having an anti-HIV effect. One study in which foscarnet was compared with the other anti-CMV drug ganciclovir (which does not have anti-HIV effects) found no difference between ganciclovir and foscarnet as treatments for CMV retinitis, but participants who received foscarnet lived longer than those on ganciclovir. Other possible explanations for the survival difference between the two treatments are that a number of people receiving ganciclovir had to stop taking AZT because of overlapping toxicities, or that foscarnet may have been inhibiting other herpes viruses which might act as co-factors to HIV. Other trials, however, have not seen improved survival associated with foscarnet therapy compared with ganciclovir. The commonest side-effects of foscarnet, which occur in more than 20% of recipients, are kidney toxicity, changes in the levels of minerals in the blood and anaemia. Other side-effects include neutropenia, central nervous system toxicity such as neuropathy, muscle twitching, irregular heartbeat, diabetes, ulcers of the penis (especially in uncircumcised men) and nausea, fever and rash. Treatment may cause a decline in the levels of calcium in the blood, which may in turn cause neurological and heart problems. Taking it Foscarnet is given by intravenous infusion. This can be managed at home using a central venous line such as a PortaCath. It is important to drink plenty of water before and/or during infusion and for a saline (saltwater) infusion to be given at the same time as the drug, to reduce the risk of kidney damage. Current developments A pilot trial investigating a liquid formulation of foscarnet that can be drunk found that it caused diarrhoea in 905 of recipients; new formulations are being developed. Studies in which the standard intravenous formulation of foscarnet was drunk found that very little was absorbed into the bloodstream and it caused diarrhoea. Some success has reported using foscarnet injected directly into the eye (intravitreal) as a treatment for CMV retinitis. Key research Polis compared survival rates for 24 people with AIDS who had received treatment with foscarnet (mean duration 6.2 months) for CMV retinitis with the historical survival rate for those patients treated with ganciclovir. 21/24 were also receiving antiretroviral treatment. The median time from the diagnosis of CMV retinitis until death was 13.5 months (range, 3 to 34 months). Patients lived longer than untreated or ganciclovir-treated historical controls with AIDS and CMV retinitis. There was no difference in the survival of patients treated with foscarnet at the time of diagnosis and those patients treated with foscarnet only after progression of their CMV retinitis. Holland reported that median survival for patients treated with ganciclovir was only 5 months. Foscarnet-treated patients experienced significant reductions in p24 antigenaemia. The investigators suggested that treatment with foscarnet prolonged the survival of these patients. However, it is not clear whether the possible survival benefit resulted from increased efficacy of foscarnet over ganciclovir, the anti-HIV effect of foscarnet, or other factors. Fletcher evaluated the pharmacokinetics and anti-HIV effect of foscarnet in 6 HIV-positive p24-antigenaemic patients with CD4 counts below 500. Patients received foscarnet 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg intravenously every eight hours for 28 days. 5/6 patients experienced declines in p24 antigenaemia; the largest reductions occurred in those patients receiving the highest dose, suggesting a dose response. Gaub treated 15 people with AIDS with foscarnet in an open, uncontrolled study. Treatment was given for 6-21 days, median 14 days. HIV detection by culture was positive in 70-80% of cultures and was unaffected by foscarnet treatment. 8 participants had detectable, free HIV antigen in serum before therapy which disappeared in 5/8 during therapy but reappeared 4-23 weeks after therapy. No patient lost HIV antigen except during foscarnet therapy. No patient became HIV antigen positive during foscarnet therapy. Immunological parameters did not change during or after foscarnet therapy. Bergdahl enrolled 21 people with ARC in Sweden in an open-label controlled trial of foscarnet (PFA) or no treatment. 11/21 patients received foscarnet 50 mg/kg intravenously every eight hours for 28 days. patients treated with PFA and 0/4 p24 antigenaemic patients who received no treatment had a decrease in p24 after 4 weeks of treatment. Meinert compared ganciclovir with foscarnet in the treatment of CMV retinitis in 234 patients with AIDS. 127 patients received ganciclovir (induction therapy of 5 mg/kg every 12 hours for 14 days, followed by maintenance therapy of 5 mg/kg/day) and 107 patients received foscarnet (induction therapy of 60 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14 days, followed by maintenance therapy of 90 mg/kg/day). At 19 months, 65 of the patients assigned to ganciclovir had died (51%) compared with 36 patients assigned to foscarnet (34%). The median survival was 8.5 months in the ganciclovir group and 12.6 months in the foscarnet group. In the foscarnet group, the only subgroup of patients identified as having excess mortality were those whose renal function was compromised on entry. There was no difference between the two treatment groups in the rate of progression of retinitis. Harb reviewed 168 patients with AIDS and CMV disease diagnosed between 1985 and October 1989. Median survival before 30 September 1987 was 4 months, compared with 9 months for cases diagnosed after 30 September 1987. No improved survival was associated with foscarnet therapy compared with ganciclovir. Jacobson (1991) treated 6 symptomatic HIV-infected patients who were persistently p24 antigenaemic despite 9-27 weeks of AZT treatment (1200 mg/day) with intravenous foscarnet (30 mg/kg every 8 hours) for 2 weeks with AZT (1200 mg/day), followed by AZT alone for 6 months (ACTG 053). Serum p24 antigen concentrations decreased in all 6 patients during the period of combined therapy by a mean 53%. Subsequently serum p24 antigen levels rose to the baseline value in 4 patients after 4-14 weeks. As predicted from in vitro studies, combined treatment with AZT and foscarnet resulted in an additive in vivo effect, but the effect was transient. Jacobson (1988) observed a 58% decrease in mean serum p24 antigen concentration among 11 people with AIDS and CMV retinitis treated with foscarnet (60 mg/kg every 8 hours administered as a 2 hour IV infusion) for 14 days; however, only two of nine patients became HIV culture negative. Although CD4 lymphocyte counts increased this increase was not statistically significant. No serious adverse reactions were noted. Leport reported the development of CMV resistant to foscarnet in a person being treated for CMV retinitis. The CMV retained susceptibility to ganciclovir. Youle reported that in a pilot study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of an oral formulation of foscarnet, 90% of recipients developed frequency of bowel openings and watery diarrhoea. 148 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 149](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/155?q1=directories) References Bergdahl S et al.

It is normally made by CD4 cells - the cells which are depleted in people with AIDS. It is therefore theorised that giving HIV-positive people supplementary injections of gamma interferon may help them to resist infections. Gamma interferon also has modest anti-HIV effects in laboratory tests. Laboratory tests have found that gamma interferon inhibits the replication of Toxoplasma gondii, the cause of the brain condition toxoplasmosis, and prevents death in animals with toxoplasmosis. It is also synergistic with anti-microbial drugs. Trials are currently assessing whether adding gamma interferon to conventional toxoplasmosis improves its effectiveness. Pilot research in non-HIV-infected people has suggested that the addition of gamma interferon to conventional treatments for non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases such as MAI may be effective in people who have developed resistance to the conventional drugs. Gamma interferon is produced by the pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim under the tradename Immukin. Current use Gamma interferon is a licensed product for treating other immune deficiency diseases, but its use in people in HIV is unlicensed and experimental. A phase I study conducted in 1989 found that it had at best mild immunological or therapeutic benefits in 16 people with AIDS, but caused significant side-effects including fever, headaches so severe that painkillers or sedation was required, fati ue, nausea and hepatitis, especially at doses of 0.1 mg/m or higher. A pilot study is currently taking place in London. Key research Suzuki reported that among T-cell deficient mice with toxoplasmosis, treatment with gamma interferon significantly prolonged survival. Holland treated 7 people with refractory disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infections who were not infected with HIV with interferon gamma (subcutaneously two or three times weekly in a dose of 25 to 50 ~g/m2 in addition to anti mycobacterial medications. Within 8 weeks of the start of interferon gamma therapy, all 7 patients had marked clinical improvement, with abatement of fever, clearing of many lesions and quiescence of others, radiographic improvement and a reduction in the need for paracentesis. Heagy administered gamma interferon (0.3-3 mg/m ) intravenously twice weekly to 21 people with AIDS, including 17 with KS. 3/17 people with KS responded; all had a CD4 count above 200. Lane treated 16 people with AIDS and KS with gamma interferon (0.001, 0.01,0.1 or 1 mg/m /day either as a single intramuscular injection or by 24-hour continuous infusion). NK cell activity was slightly enhanced at the 0.1 mg/m2 dose but was suppressed at the 1.0 mg/m2 dose. Significant enhancement of monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity was observed at 1 mg/m 7/14 evaluable participants experienced KS progression over a 5-week observation period and the other 7 remained stable. Dose-related toxicities included fever, headache, fatigue, nausea and hepatitis, especially at doses of 0.1 mg/m2 and above. Brockmeyer reported rapid progression of KS lesions in a small number of people after gamma interferon was added to alpha interferon and AZT. References Brockmeyer NH et al.

SGanciclovir Ganciclovir is an anti-CMV drug that works by inhibiting CMVs DNA polymerase enzyme It can prevent CMV replication for a time, but not eliminate it from the body (i.e. it is virustatic rather than virucidal). Ganciclovir is manufactured by Syntex under the tradename Cymevene. In the USA its tradename is Cytovene. Current use Intravenous ganciclovir is an approved drug for treating CMV retinitis and preventing or delaying recurrences. It is also being tested as a treatment for CMV colitis. Long-term administration of ganciclovir is often necessary, but this can be highly inconvenient because the drug has to be administered intravenously through an implanted central venous catheter. Alternative modes of delivery are being tested, including the injection of ganciclovir directly into the eye (intravitreal) or the use of devices implanted A-Z OF TREATMENTS 149 [Page 150](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/156?q1=directories) into the eye that relase ganciclovir slowly over a period of time. Ganciclovir is also being tested in combination with the other approved intravenous anti-CMV drug, foscarnet. The development of strains of CMV that are resistant to ganciclovir has been reported. Taking it Intravenous ganciclovir is infused two or three times a day through a central venous line. This is a procedure that can be managed at home. In some cases where people were unable to manage the catheter or cannot have a catheter because of infections or other reasons, it may be possible to attend the clinic regularly or have a home nurse visit to infuse the drug. Each infusion normally takes one hour. Treatment for CMV retinitis is usually continued at a dose of 10-15 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. The usual dose for maintenace therapy is 5 mg/kg/day. People who have kidney impairment may be offered a reduced dose of ganciclovir because a smaller proportion of each dose of the drug will be excreted from the body. Side-effects Ganciclovir suppresses the bone-marrow. Since AZT also has this effect it is usually recommended that people should not take AZT at the same time as ganciclovir. The alternatives are to use other anti-HIV drugs such as ddl or ddC, or to try to reduce the risk of anaemia by using blood-cell-stimulating treatments such as G-CSF at the same time as AZT and ganciclovir. Laboratory evidence suggests that ganciclovir may reduce the anti-HIV effects of AZT and ddl. Other side-effects include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, rash, hypotension, nausea, vomiting and headache. More than 10% of ganciclovir recipients have to stop treatment because of side-effects. Ganciclovir has been reported to reduce levels of serum testosterone, and low levels of testosterone may be one of the factors associated with wasting in AIDS. Current developments An oral (capsule) version of ganciclovir is being tested for primary prophylaxis and maintenance therapy for CMV retinitis. Preliminary results are promising. Oral ganciclovir increases blood levels of ddl among people taking both drugs, which may lead to an increased risk of serious ddl toxicities such as pancreatitis. An open label scheme is available in the UK to provide oral ganciclovir to people who cannot maintain a catheter for intravenous infusions. This scheme is unfortunately not open to people who are able to have a catheter fitted. Key research Drew treated 72 people with AIDS with ganciclovir for CMV disease and prospectively monitored for the development of drug-resistant virus. No resistant strains were found in 31 patients before therapy or among seven culture-positive patients treated for less than or equal to 3 months. Of 1 3 culture-positive patients treated for greater than or equal to 3 months, 5 excreted virus resistant to ganciclovir. Thus, 38% of patients and receiving ganciclovir for over 3 months and excreting virus or, overall, 7.6% of the patients were excreting CMV resistant to the drug. Follansbee compared the safety of oral ganciclovir with that of intravenous ganciclovir for maintenance of CMV retinitis by pooling the results of three studies. Adverse events associated with catheters or injection sites were more frequent in the IV group (22%) than the oral group (6%). Sepsis occurred more frequently and earlier in the IV group (17%) than the oral group (6%). IV ganciclovir was associated with more leukopenia (25%) than oral ganciclovir (29% and 19%) respectively. There were no significant differences between the formulations for other adverse events including gastro-intestinal events. Buhles evaluated the rates of resistance to ganciclovir among people with AIDS and CMV retinitis treated with intravenous or oral ganciclovir in three clinical trials. The estimated prevalence of resistance was approximately 2% for the two randomised controlled 20 week trials. In a third dose-ranging trial, 3 out of 8 isolates tested were resistant after 78, 87 and 119 days. Development of resistance was no more common with oral than IV ganciclovir.

They are mass-produced using recombinant genetic engineering techniques. Granulocytes are also known as neutrophils; they are immune cells that act against bacteria and fungi. A shortage of neutrophils (neutropenia) can be caused by some treatment drugs such as AZT, ganciclovir or cytotoxic chemotherapy for KS or lymphoma. Macrophages are scavenging immune cells that absorb foreign organisms and stimulate other immune responses. G-CSF is also known as lenograstim or filgrastim, or by its tradename Neupogen, manufactured by Amgen and Roche. GM-CSF is sometimes referred to by the generic name molgramostim and is produced by Sandoz and Schering-Plough under the tradename Leucomax. Current use G-CSF and GM-CSF are licensed drugs for jhe treatment of white blood cell shortages in some medical conditions. GM-CSF has been shown to be safe and effective in improving white cell counts in people with neutropenia. GM-CSF may also increase the anti-HIV effects of AZT. However, macrophages can be infected by HIV, so by 150 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 151](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/157?q1=directories) stimulating these cells GM-CSF and M-CSF may also increase HIV replication. For this reason it may be safer to use G-CSF, which only stimulates granulocytes. In vitro evidence suggests that GM-CSF can increase the anti-HIV effects of AZT. GM-CSF and M-CSF may slightly diminish the anti-HIV activity of and ddl. The commonest side-effect of G-CSF and GM-CSF is bone pain, occurring in 10-20% of patients. More rarely, G-CSF can cause difficulty or pain when urinating (dysuria) and liver abnormalities. Long-term use may cause inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis). Adverse reactions to GM-CSF include skin rashes, lethargy and muscle pain (myalgia), each occurring in 10-20% of individuals. Pain and swelling may occur at the site of injection in about 10% of patients. Some people experience unpleasant side-effects after the first injection, including flushing, low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting; this can be reversed with oxygen and an intravenous infusion of saline. At doses above 20 pg/kg per day, GM-CSF has been associated with significant problems such as fluid in the lungs and around the heart (pleural and pericardial effusions) and the development of blood clots that obstruct veins or the blood supply to the lungs (venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). Taking it Colony stimulating factors are administered by subcutaneous injection or by intravenous infusion. Getting it G-CSF and GM-CSF are licensed drugs which can be prescribed by doctors on the NHS. M-CSF is an unlicensed therapy that is not available in Britain. Current developments Researchers are studying an experimental intravenous compound called PIXY 321, which combines the active parts of GM-CSF and interleukin-3. In vitro the two separate substances have a synergistic effect in stimulating the growth of blood cells. It is hoped that PIXY 321 may turn out to be an effective treatment for pancytopenia (shortage of all blood cells). Key research Miles conducted a Phase 1/11 study in which 22 people with severe ARC or AIDS and multilineage haematopoietic defects were treated with daily G-CSF (0.3-3.6 pg/kg/day) and erythropoietin (EPO) until blood counts normalised. All participants were neutropenic and anaemic after withdrawal of all bone marrow-suppressive drugs. Groups of patients were administered increasing doses of AZT to determine their tolerance. All 22 participants responded to G-CSF with a mean 10-fold increase in neutrophils occurring in less than 2 weeks. Significant increases in CD4 and CD8 cell number, lymphocyte proliferative response and bone marrow cellularity were seen. EPO therapy increased hmoglobin in all 20 evaluable patients within 8 weeks..1 6 participants resumed AZT (1000 or 1500 mg/day); 8 once again required transfusions and 6 stopped AZT. Toxicities were mild and did not require dose modifications. Plasma and lymphocyte co-cultures for HIV and p24 antigen levels did not change significantly during G-CSF or combined G-CSF and EPO therapy. Van der Wouw treated 12 oeople with ARC or AIDS who had AZT-associated neutropenia with G-CSF (daily subcutaneous injections in a weekly increasing dose of 0.4, 2, 5 or 10 pg/kg until a neutrophil count of more than 3 x 109 neutrophils/l was reached) in a phase I/Il study. This effective dose was continued for up to 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks observation period without G-CSF treatment. 2 participants (both with ARC) reached target neutrophil counts at the lowest G-CSF dose, whereas 9 participants needed 2 pg/kg. 1 participant discontinued treatment before he reached target neutrophil counts. Monocyte counts also increased significantly. The numbers of neutrophils and monocytes returned to pre-treatment values by 2 weeks after treatment ended. Mild side-effects consisting of bone, joint or muscle pain were observed in 3 patients. Groopman administered GM-CSF to 16 patients with AIDS and leukopenia. Each patient first received a single intravenous dose (1-5 x 103 units/kg/day); 48 hours later a 14-day continuous intravenous infusion of the agent was begun. Treatment resulted in dose-dependent increases in circulating leukocytes and in increases in circulating neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes. Mild side-effects - low-grade fever, myalgia, phlebitis and flushing - were observed in some patients; there were no life-threatening toxic reactions. Pluda treated 10 people with AIDS or ARC with GM-CSF (2 pg/kg/day) for 12 days, followed by an alternating regime of 7 days AZT, 5 days GM-CSF and 2 days no treatment. 5/12 were unable to tolerate conventional doses of AZT on entry. During the initial 12 days of GM-CSF administration, mean white blood cell value increased and circulating monocytes were stimulated but serum p24 antigen also increased in 6/6 evaluable participants. During alternating AZT and GM-CSF, serum p24 antigen fell again. Mean CD4 counts value increased in participants who had not previously received AZT, but generally did not change in those who had prior AZT exposure. Haematologic toxicity appeared to be somewhat reduced compared with continuous full-dose AZT therapy and 2 patients with previous AZT haematologic toxicity tolerated this alternating regimen for 25 weeks. Hammer studied the effects of AZT alone, GM-CSF alone and AZT plus GM-CSF on HIV-infected alveolar macrophages. AZT effectively suppressed HIV replication and prevented transfer/amplification in target PBMLs as long as the drug was maintained in the medium. GM-CSF neither suppressed nor augmented HIV replication. The combination of AZT/GM-CSF was comparable with AZT alone in suppressing both the initial infection of macrophages and the transfer to target PBMLs as long as the agents were maintained in the cultures. However, when the drugs were removed at the same time that PHA-stimulated PBMLs were added to the culture, the combination of AZT/GM-CSF was found to be more effective than AZT alone in preventing the transfer/amplification of HIV in the target lymphocytes, suggesting that the combination of AZT and GM-CSF may have an enhanced anti-HIV-1 activity compared with AZT alone. Hewitt reported that in an open trial in 11 people with ARC or AIDS who were already receiving AZT, GM-CSF was able to correct AZT-induced neutropenia in 7/11. The combination was well-tolerated. An additive antiviral effect from the combination was reported. Perno reported that in vitro, GM-CSF stimulates HIV replication in monocytes, but enhances the antiviral effect of AZT. M-CSF also stimulates HIV replication but does not potentiate AZT activity. G-CSF and EPO do not enhance HIV replication. M-CSF and GM-CSF diminish the efficacy of ddC and ddl. Davey reported that in patients with AIDS in whom neutropenia developed during treatment with AZT and interferon alpha, GM-CSF (0.0625 to 1 pg/kg/day) maintained neutrophil counts at 1500 or higher. p24 antigen levels increased in 6/9 during GM-CSF treatment but decreased when AZT was given with GM-CSF. Scadden reported that anti-GM-CSF antibodies did not develop in a study of GM-CSF therapy (subcutaneously at doses ranging from 125 to 500 pg/m2/day) for 18 people with KS who became neutropenic while receiving combined zidovudine and interferon-alpha 2a.

SGEM 91 GEM 91 is an experimental drug based on antisense technology, which was engineered specifically to inhibit HIV. Preliminary tests showed that GEM 91 prevented HIV from reproducing in the test-tube. When HIV infects a cell, it incorporates part of its genetic material (called the proviral DNA) into the genetic material (or DNA) of the human cell. When the HIV-infected cell reproduces, the proviral DNA is converted into messenger RNA (mRNA) and travels out from the cell nucleus to make the proteins from which new virus particles are made. There are small but important differences in the genetic make-up of different strains of HIV from around the world. Changes also occur when HIV mutates and becomes resistant to antiviral drugs such as AZT. However, researchers at the Hybridon biotechnology company in Massachusetts have identified a small piece of the mRNA in HIV-infected cells which is identical in every strain and does not vary when the virus replicates. Technically, this part of HIV's genetic material is called the initiation codon of the gag gene. The antisense drug is a molecule which has been carefully designed so that it binds tightly onto this unchanging part of the mRNA. This means that when the infected cell reproduces, the antisense drug prevents the production of the proteins from which new virus particles would be made and so prevents the infection of other cells. Hybridon's researchers have been able to manufacture the antisense drug in a form which can get inside HIV-infected cells in laboratory tests. In treated cells, HIV replication decreased substantially. Doses were then reduced until they were 100 times lower than those initially used, but the virus remained unable to reproduce. Current use GEM 91 is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Although the results of test-tube studies are promising, there is not yet any evidence that the drug will be effective in people. Independent researchers foresee many practical problems, such as absorbing the drug into the body, preventing it from being broken down in the bloodstream, ensuring that it is absorbed by HIV-infected cells and crossing the so-called blood-brain barrier so that it reaches infected cells in the brain. Trials of GEM 91 are now underway in the USA and France. The manufacturer reports that in the French study the drug is being well-tolerated, with the only side-effect being soreness at the injection site. The trial is continuing to test GEM 91 at increasing doses. Key research Agrawal reported that GEM 91 showed anti-HIV activity in acutely infected cells, chronically infected cells, long-term cultures using H9 and Molt 3 cells and primary peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages using laboratory strains and clinical isolates. Plasma half-life is up to 30 hours in rats and 50 hours in monkeys when administered intravenously. Lisziewicz reported that GEM 91 inhibited viral replication in long-term culture for over 80 days. After pretreatment of cells, the concentration of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide could be decreased by greater than 10-fold and still maintain inhibition of viral replication. Sereni treated 23 patients with single escalating doses of GEM 91 (0.1 - 1 mg/kg intravenously or subcutaneously). No major toxicities were observed. 6/18 participants developed localised painful nodules at the site of subcutaneous injection. References Agrawal S et al.

Researchers have produced an experimental form of gentamicin in which the drug is encapsulated in fatty particles called liposomes. This liposomal gentamicin is being tested in combination with other drugs for the treatment of MAI. It is administered by intravenous injection. One person with MAI in a study of high-dose liposomal gentamicin developed reversible kidney failure, but no other side-effects have been seen. Gentamicin is also known as aminoglycoside gentamicin. gp120 vaccines Gpl 20 is a therapeutic vaccine preparation. Gp 120 is the name of the protein found on the outside of HIV virus particles (the envelope protein). Several different research teams have artificially manufactured copies of this protein (called recombinant gpl 20 or rgpl 20) through genetic engineering techniques. The theory is that by injecting this protein into people who are already infected with HIV, the immune system may be stimulated to attack not only the recombinant gpl 20 protein but also the 'real' protein found on the surface of HIV particles and HIV-infected cells. Current use Several different gpl 20 preparations are being studied. The company Genentech has produced two gpl 20 vaccines, one using gpl 20 from the MN strain of HIV (which is the type found in the vast majority of HIV-positive people in the UK and the USA) and the other using the IIIB strain (which is a laboratory strain only found in about 5% of people with HIV in the USA). Both of the Genentech vaccines are produced from mammalian cells in the laboratory. Tests with chimpanzees produced contradictory results, with one study suggesting that the vaccine protected 152 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 153](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/159?q1=directories) them against HIV infection and another finding no such protective effect. Trial results in humans have to date shown that the vaccines are safe and that vaccination causes an increase in levels of antibodies against gpl 20. It is not yet known whether these changes actually have any effect on the progress of the disease. A trial is underway comparing the effects of these two vaccines given indiviudally or in combination to people with HIV. Another gpl 20 vaccine is manufactured by Chiron and Biocine; it is called ENV 2-3. This is derived from the SF-2 strain of HIV (originally isolated from a San Franciscan man) and is grown in yeast cells. Trials are at an early stage; preliminary results from a phase I study in asymptomatic people with HIV have found no effect on CD4 count or virus levels. Biocine are also developing another gpl 20 vaccine based on the SF-2 strain, produced in mammalian cells. This vaccine, called gpl20 (CHO), has been reported to stimulate anti-gp] 20 antibodies in uninfected people. A phase I study enrolling HIV-positive people is underway. Getting it No studies of gpl 20 vaccines are taking place in Britain. gp 120 (MN strain; Genentech) MN rgpl20/HIV-1 is a genetically engineered form of envelope glycoprotein gpl 20 derived from HIV-1 strain MN. The HIV-1 strain MN is highly representative of strains commonly found in North America; the principal neutralizing determinant (PND) of the MN strain is found in approximately 60% of isolates in the United States whereas the PND of strain IIIB is found in only 5% of isolates in the US. MN rgpl 20/HIV-1 is propagated in a mammalian cell line. MN rgpl20/HIV-1 was compared in preclinical studies with 1118 rgpl20/HIV-1 to assess differences in fusion inhibition of rgpl20 recombinant CD4, reactivity with the principal neutralizing determinant (PND) of gp1 20 and ability to neutralize various clinical isolates of HIV-1. The two products stimulated roughly approximate levels of antibodies to gpl 20. According to the manufacturer, the vaccine based on MN was capable of reacting with the PND of five diverse isolates while the IIIB vaccine only reacted with the PND of the IIIB strain of HIV-1. Single doses of MN rgpl 20/HIV-1 up to 300 g have been administered safely to animals. Hamilton enrolled 122 asymptomatic HIV-positive people with CD4 counts above 500 in a double-blind placebo-controlled phase I safety and immunogenicity study of MN gpl 20 ccine (300 or 600 g) with or without IIIB gpl 20 vaccine. Seven injections were administered over eight months. PBMC from enrollees were stimulated ex vivo with antigens from and MN gpl and enterotoxin. increases in proliferative responses to the gpl 20 antigens were observed in all vaccinated groups. Allan reported that no clinically adverse events attributable to MN gpl 20 vaccine occurred. gp120 (IIIB strain, Genentech) IIIB rgpl20/HIV is a genetically engineered form of envelope glycoprotein gpl 20 derived from HIV-1 strain IIIB. It is propagated in mammalian cells. Berman reported that IIIB rgpl20/HIV-1 protected two chimpanzees from infection with a homologous strain of cell-free HIV after three inoculations with 300 g vaccine. No clinical or serologic signs of infection were found over 24 months of observation. However, Arthur reported earlier that another recombinantly produced vaccine based on gp120 from HIV strain IIIB did not protect chimpanzees from infections with a homologous strain of HIV. Hamilton enrolled 122 asymptomatic HIV-positive people with CD4 counts above 500 in a double-blind placebo-controlled phase I safety and immunogenicity study of MN gpl 20 vaccine (300 or 600 qg) with or without IIIB gpl 20 vaccine. Seven inlections were administered over eight months. PBMC from enrollees were stimulated ex vivo with antigens from and MN gpl and enterotoxin. increases in proliferative responses to the gpl 20 antigens were observed in all vaccinated groups. Birx enrolled 42 HIV-positive asymptomatic people in a phase I dose-ranging toxicity study of rgpl20(lai) at Walter Reed Army Institute. Participants received 100, 300 or 600 g vaccine according to one of two schedules: 0, 1, 4, 8, 16 weeks or 0, 8, 16 weeks. Twenty one participants completed 170 days on study. rgpl20(lai) induced broad envelope reactivity to epitopes not often recognized in native infection. Significant increases in total envelope antibody and V3 titre were seen. Schwartz assigned HIV-seronegative volunteers to receive either 100 pg IIIB rgpl 20 10), 300 alum adjuvant alone (n=8) intramuscularly at 0, 4 and 32 weeks. Immunisations were well tolerated. Antibodies that neutralised homologous HIV-1 IIIB were induced in 9/10 recipients after three 300 pg doses and 6/9 sera also neutralised heterologous HIV-1 SF2. A dose response was evident, since three 100 pig injections induced lower titres of HIV-1 IIIB neutralising antibodies and in fewer recipients (5/9) than the higher dose, with no neutralisation of HIV-1 SF2. Similarly, syncytia-inhibiting, CD4-rgpl 20-blocking and HIV-1 IIIB V3-binding antibodies were induced in a dose dependent manner. Response to the 300 sg per dose vaccination occurred in a larger proportion of volunteers and at higher mean titres than seen in previous human trials with other recombinant envelope subunit vaccines or live vaccinia-env priming followed by envelope subunit boosting. After 2 doses, antibody responses were similar to those observed in the protective response obtained in chimpanzees injected with the same immunogen after 2 doses. ENV 2,3 ENV 2,3 is modeled on envelope glycoprotein gpl 20. It is derived from the SF-2 strain of HIV-1 and propagated in yeast cells. The vaccine has been administered with a combination of adjuvant muramyl tripeptide (MTP-PE) and an emulsion (MF59). MF59 may also adjuvant properties. Abrignani administered intramuscular injections of ENV 2,3 to 7 HIV-negative patients, utilizing one of two regimens: three injections of 50 or 250 pg or six injections of 250 ig. All patients received 100 pg MTP-PE. The four patients who received 50 pg ENV 2,3 developed evidence of CD4 cell priming and lymphoproliferative responses specific for gpl 20. Wintsch conducted a phase 1 trial of ENV 2,3 with MTP-PE adjuvant in 25 healthy HIV-negative volunteers. 10 volunteers received adjuvant alone and 15 received 50 or 250 pg doses of ENV 2,3 administered intramuscularly in two immunization regimens. In general, adjuvant and vaccine were well tolerated. Antibody responses to both the homologous antigen ENV 2,3 (SF2) and antigens from other highly divergent HIV isolates were elicited in the majority of vaccine recipients. However, antibody titres were low, without neutralizing activity. In 9/11 volunteers who received the complete vaccine immunization series, a significant specific T lymphocyte response was observed. Keefer administered ENV 2,3 (30 pg) combined with one of six doses of MTP-PE (0, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 pg) in MF59 emulsion to 36 HIV-negative volunteers and a further 12 volunteers received MTP-PE/MF59 alone. Preparations were administered as 3 intramuscular injections at days 0, 30 and 180. Significant systemic reactions and/or fever were noted in 12/36 volunteers who received ENV 2-3/MTP-PE/MF59; and erythema in homologous V3 binding, cell fusion inhibition and neutralising antibodies with or without the addition of MTP-PE. Immunogenicity was not enhanced further by the administration of a fourth dose of ENV 2-3, or by a higher dose of 100 pg ENV 2-3 in MF59 alone. Corey and McElrath reported preliminary results from a Phase I trial of ENV 2,3 in asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals who were not antigenamic. 30 participants had CD4 counts above 600 and 15 had CD4 counts of 400-550. They received either ENV 2,3 (30 pg) with MTP-PE (100 pg) or MTP-PE alone at months 0, 1,4, 7 and 10. The vaccine was associated with transient local pain and systemic symptoms in 82% and 40% of volunteers respectively. No significant changes in CD4 count or quantitative viral culture have been observed. Quantitative PCR data are pending. Approximately one-third of participants experienced significant systemic reactions including malaise, myalgia, headache and moderate fever and two-thirds experienced local reactions. gp120 (CHO) (Biocine) rgpl 20 (CHO) is a recombinant form of envelope glycoprotein gpl 20 derived from HIV-1 strain SF-2. The molecule is fully glycosylated, allowing it to closely simulate the three-dimensional structure of naturally-occurring gpl 20. rgp120 (CHO) is expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. rgpl 20 (CHO) has been administered with a combination of adjuvant muramyl tripeptide (MTP-PE) and an emulsion (MF59). MF59 may also have some adjuvant properties. Steimer reported that conformation-dependent antibodies to gp1 20 neutralize divergent strains of HIV-1. The conformational similarity of rgpl 20 CHO to the native gpl 20 may have positive implications for its ability to block primary infection of diverse HIV-1 strains. Kahn reported that rgp120 (CHO) has stimulated antibodies to gp120 that have persisted at least three months. Forty-two HIV-negative patients were randomized to six arms, corresponding to increasing doses of MTP-PE, ranging from 0-300 g. Within each arm, six patients received 25 g rgpl20 (CHO) in MF59 emulsion and two patients received MTP-PE alone. Three A-Z OF TREATMENTS 153 [Page 154](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/160?q1=directories) injections were administered. The best responses appear to be correlated with higher doses of MTP-PE. References Abrignani S et al.

Gpl 60 is the name of the protein which makes up the whole outer layer of HIV particles. Several different research teams have artificially manufactured copies of this protein (called recombinant gp160 or rgpl 60) through genetic engineering techniques. The theory is that by injecting this protein into people who are already infected with HIV, the immune system may be stimulated to attack not only the recombinant gpl 60 protein but also the 'real' protein found on the surface of HIV particles. However, studies in HIV-negative people have raised doubts on this strategy, as the antibodies that were induced by vaccination with HIV proteins proved to be ineffective at neutralising strains of HIV taken from people with HIV. Current use Several different gpl 60 preparations are being studied. VaxSyn HIV-1 (gp160), manufactured by MicroGeneSys Inc, is propagated in insect cells. It was shown to be safe in a study on 72 healthy volunteers, although any protective effect remains unknown. In people with HIV, VaxSyn HIV-1 (gp160) produced increases in measurements of immune functioning. Trials are continuing but to date there is no information about whether the vaccine can affect clinical course of the disease i.e. by delaying or preventing symptoms or prolonging survival. Another gp160 vaccine, Immuno-Ag (developed jointly by NIAID and Immuno-US Inc), is manufactured from mammalian tissue cells. Placebo-controlled Phase 1 studies comparing low-dose (12.5 pg) and high-dose (50 pg) vaccine with boosters after 1, 6 and 12 months found that the vaccine produced increases in antibodies which were relatively short-lived and evidence of cellular immune responses. No side-effects were seen. Chimpanzees that have been immunised with this vaccine during the last four years have survived more than 100 challenges with HIV. A recombinant vaccine using gpl 60 and a vaccinia vector, called HIVAC-le (manufactured by Bristol-Myers) produced only weak immune responses in a Phase 1 study and is not being pursued. Use in combinations So far only one study has tested VaxSyn vaccine in combination with AZT. The trial enrolled people with CD4 counts above 400. No difference in CD4 response was seen between people taking the combination and people taking only VaxSyn. Studies have tested VaxSyn in combination with a vaccine produce based on HIV's core protein p24. A study in which the vaccines were administered intramuscularly suggested that people with initial CD4 counts between 200 and 500 saw a temporary CD4 count increase, but no effects were seen in people with initial counts below 200. In a separate study, the combination of vaccines administered intradermally seemed to be less effective than VaxSyn alone. Getting it No studies of gp160 vaccines are taking place in Britain. Current developments An American study is testing the VaxSyn vaccine for safety and efficacy in stimulating immune responses in expectant HIV-positive mothers and preventing HIV transmission to their babies. VaxSyn rgpl 60 (MicroGeneSys) VaxSyn is a molecularly-cloned, denatured envelope glycoprotein derived from the LAV strain of HIV-1. It is propagated in insect cells and adsorbed to an alum adjuvant. The preparation is expressed in baculovirus. Orentas reported that, in vitro, VaxSyn-primed lymphocytes lysed HIV-infected cells, recognized gpl 60 from a variety of viral strains and did not kill uninfected CD4 cells with gpl20 bound to their surfaces. Dolin administered rgpl60 (40 or 80 pg), Hepatitis B vaccine (10 pg) or placebo in three doses (on days 0, 30 and 180), with an elective, nonblinded administration of a fourth dose on day 540, to healthy HIV-negative adults. Neither clinical nor laboratory toxicity was encountered during a follow-up period exceeding 21 months. No effect of immunization was noted on lymphocyte counts, mitogenic responses or delayed-type hypersensitivity. Serum antibody responses to HIV envelope proteins detected by Western blot were seen in 30/33 volunteers who received rgp160 and were most commonly of weakly reactive intensity. Responses were first noted by Western blot after the second dose. They markedly increased in frequency after the third dose and declined over the next 12 to 18 months. Serum neutralizing activity and complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement were seen in some volunteers after the fourth dose. Keefer assessed the safety and immunogenicity of rgpl 60 (160 and 640 jig intramuscularly on days 0, 30, 180 and 365) versus placebo in 55 healthy low risk seronegative volunteers. Minor local reactions (pain, erythema, induration) occurred in the rgp160 recipients but did not consistently increase with later injections or the higher dose. There was a trend toward increased malaise and myalgia in the high-dose group. No other clinical or laboratory adverse effects were found in either group. In the 160 jg group, antibodies were detectable by Western Blot in 14/20, 18/20 and 17/18 154 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 155](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/161?q1=directories) volunteers after the 2nd, 3rd and 4th injections, respectively. Band intensity increased with each injection. No neutralising antibodies or cell fusion inhibition antibodies could be detected after the 3rd or 4th injections. In the 640 pg group, antibodies were detectable in 2/19, 18/19 and 20/20 volunteers after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd injections, respectively. Again, band intensity increased with booster injections. 50% of volunteers had developed neutralising antibodies 14-30 days after the 3rd injection, but no cell fusion inhibition antibodies were detectable. All assays using sera obtained after the 4th 640 pg injection are underway. Redfield (1991) enrolled 30 HIV-positive people with CD4 cell count above 400 in a phase I open-label study of rgp 160 (VaxSyn HIV-1 (gp160)). Patients received 40 pg, 160 pg or 640 pg in two dosing schedules (on days 0, 30 and 120; or on days 0, 30, 60, 120, 150 and 180). Response to treatment was defined as an increase in both cellular and humoral immune responses against HIV envelope-specific epitopes. 19/30 responded to treatment. Response was correlated with high baseline CD4 counts (13/16 patients with CD4 above 600 responded, as opposed to 6/14 with baseline CD4 below 600). Response rates were also higher in the group which received six injections (13/15 responders) rather than three injections (6/15) responders. Mean baseline CD4 cell count for responders was 716 compared to 605 for non-responders. 240 days after the start of treatment, CD4 cells decreased by a mean of 0.2% in the responders and decreased by a mean of 7.3% in the non-responders. Redfield (1992) reported that 28/30 participants in the original phase I trial have continued to receive gpl 60 in a phase IB extension study. 18 who initially responded in the phase I trial received one injection of gp160 (160 pg) every four months. 10 initial vaccine non-responders received a series of six injections (640 gg) on day 0, 7, 30, 60, 90 and 120 and then every 4 months. 9 initial non-responders who have completed the course have all demonstrated both new humoral and cellular HIV envelope responses. All responders continue to demonstrate increases in cellular and humoral responses with booster injections. However, the duration of the vaccine induced immune response was variable among volunteers. Toxicity remains limited to local reaction post immunisation. 7/11 participants evaluated have demonstrated a decrease in total genome viral RNA and a reduction in genomic HIV RNA expression per infected PBMC. Tsoukas (1993) enrolled 21 asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals with CD4 counts above 500 in a phase I study of VaxSyn HIV-1 (gp 20). Ten received 160 pg and 11 received 320 pg intramuscularly on days 0, 30, 60, 90, 180 and every 120 days thereafter. No adverse effects were noted. Significant increases in mean absolute CD4 count were observed by week 16, 28 and 52. The increases at week 68 and 84 were less and statistically non-significant. After week 84 a statistically non-significant decline was observed. Tsoukas (1994) enrolled 277 asymptomatic HIV-positive people with CD4 counts above 500 in a multicentre double-blind study comparing gp160 (320 pg intramuscularly) and placebo. Participants received four monthly injections followed by injections every 3 months for the first year. At a preliminary analysis after 4,183 patient-months of follow-up, 34 participants had discontinued, all for non-medical reasons. No significant side-effects have been seen. 44 clinical events, including 3 AIDS-defining illnesses, had occurred. Valentine randomly treated 52 healthy subjects (CD4 above 400) seropositive for both HIV and hepatitis B surface antigen with immunisations of recombinant hepatitis vaccine or one of 4 doses (20, 80, 320 or 1280 pg) of recombinant gp160 LAV vaccine (MicroGeneSys) at 0,1, 3, 6 and 12 months. After immunisation with rgpl 60 but not hepatitis B vaccine all participants developed large lymphocyte proliferative responses (LPR) to rgpl 60. All 4 doses of vaccine induced LPR to the same degree. After immunisation lymphocytes also made IL-2 when stimulated by rgpl60 in vitro and manifested increased cytotoxic activity against gpl60-expressing autologous targets. Trivial local reactions at the injection sites were the only toxicity seen. Wahren treated 40 asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals with CD4 above 400 with 160 pg gpl 60 vaccine (VaxSyn HIV-1, MicroGeneSys) at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 17 and 26. They were then followed for a further 6 months. Each person was randomised to receive AZT (200 mg 4 times a day) or placebo for 14 days after each injection. Improved and highly specific T-cell proliferative responses were seen in 39/40 participants after vaccination. The 6-month imunization was followed by a strong specific response against gp160. After 12 months the CD4 trend had improved in 30. During the six month treatment phase, both percentage and absolute number of CD4 cells increased in a majority of participants. There was no obvious additional positive effect in those receiving concomitant AZT compared with placebo recipients. Blick (1993a) reported on 30 individuals with AIDS, ARC and asymptomatic HIV infection treated with intramuscular inlections recombinant gpl 60 (320 pg) and p24 (640 pg) vaccines at days 0 and 7, months 1,2, 4 and 6 and at 3 month intervals thereafter for 21 months. From month 24, participants received gp160 vaccine alone. In 16 participants with CD4 counts of 200-500 (mean 348) evaluated at months 4, 5, 6, 12, 15, 18 and 21, mean change in CD4 counts were +77, +108, +71, gp160 epitopal antibody responses by months 6-9. None had progressed to ARC or AIDS by month 24. No statistically significant differences were noted in participants with baseline CD4 counts of below 200 (n= 14). Blick (1993b) also reported on 50 individuals with AIDS, ARC and asymptomatic HIV infection treated with intradermal injections of recombinant gpl60 (160 pg) with or without p24 (320 pg) vaccine at days 0 and 7, months 1, 2, 4 and 6 and at 3 month intervals thereafter for 24 months. 18 participants with CD4 counts above 200 were unblinded; in 10 who received gpl 60 alone, CD4 counts improved from 347 to 395 (13.8% increase). In 8 participants who received both vaccines, CD4 counts fell from 343 to 318 (7.3% decrease). This finding contrasts with the CD4 increase seen with intramuscular administration (described above). Bratt reported that 32/40 patients experienced enhanced HIV-specific T and B cell responses when treated with six intramuscular doses of VaxSyn 160 pg over six months. The addition of AZT in a double-blind fashion produced no additive value. Kundu gave VaxSyn or recombinant hepatitis B vaccine as control to 26 HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts above 400. 18/21 VaxSyn recipients experienced HIV-specific cellular responses and increased gamma interferon and interleukin-2 production while no hepatitis B vaccine recipients demonstrated significant changes to those parameters. Immuno-Ag rgpl 60 rgpl 60 is a recombinant form of envelope glycoprotein gp160 derived from the IIIB strain of HIV-1. It is fully glycosylated, with a three-dimensional shape approximately identical to gp160. rgpl 60 is formulated with alum and deoxycholate adjuvant and propagated in mammalian tissue culture cells. Mannhalter demonstrated long-lasting proliferation of gp160-specific lymphocyte responses in chimpanzees treated with rgpl 60. Gorse treated 30 HIV-negative individuals with four versus five intramuscular injections of 50 g rgpl 60 in two accelerated schedules. No significant clinical or laboratory toxicities were observed. Anti-envelope binding antibodies were generated by both dosing schedules in similar amounts 28 days after the last dose of vaccine and a vigorous lymphocyte proliferative response to rgpl60 occurred. Belshe administered rgp 160 (1 2.5 g or 50 pg) or adjuvant control (alum plus deoxycholate) to 60 adult volunteers in a double blind randomized controlled trial. Injections were given at 0, 1, 6 and 12 months. 50 pg recipients also received an additional single dose of 200 pig. Clinical response, laboratory toxicities and immune response were measured before and 1 month after each injection. Neither significant clinical nor laboratory toxicities were associated with the vaccine. The 50 pg dose was more immunogenic than the lower dose; after 2 doses more than half the recipients developed antibodies against at least one HIV envelope protein and all had antibodies after 4 doses. However, antibody titres fell within 6 months of the last injection. Neutralizing antibodies developed in a higher proportion of the 200 pg. Both groups exhibited lymphocyte proliferation responses after the first dose of vaccine. Schwartz reported that interim findings from an ongoing trial of rgpl60 (50 pg) in asymptomatic individuals with morning CD4 counts above 600 suggest that immunisation is well-tolerated, that env-specific T-helper cells are missing or defective even in very healthy HIV-positive individuals with relatively intact immune responses to recall antigens and that repeated injections of rgpl60 can induce specific T-cell proliferative responses. HIVAC-le Graham evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of HIVAC-le vaccine in 36 vaccinia-naive, healthy volunteers at low risk for acquiring HIV-1 infection. Volunteers were randomized to receive HIVAC-1 e or control vaccinia virus at two dosages (106 or 107 pfu/mL) by bifurcated needle puncture at 0 and 2 months. There was no significant difference in lesion size, level of viral replication or systemic symptoms after vaccination with HIVAC-le or control vaccinia virus. Of 22 HIVAC-le recipients with lesion formation, 16 developed low-titre gpl60-specific antibody responses detectable by Western blot. The peak response occurred between days 70 and 120 and was still detectable at day 365 in 9/18 vaccinees. gpl60-specific lymphoproliferative responses were detected in 5/10 vaccinees. Cooney conducted a randomised phase I trial of HIVAC-le in 35 healthy, HIV-seronegative males, 31 of whom had a history of smallpox immunisation and 4 of whom were vaccinia naive. Vaccination was boosted 8 weeks later with HIVAC-1 e or standard NY strain vaccinia virus. The frequency, duration and titre of virus isolation from the vaccination site and occurrence of local side-effects were similar between the two groups of vaccinees. Vaccinia-naive (vac-n) participants shed virus from the vaccination site for longer and at a higher titre than did vaccinia-primed (vac-p) individuals (19 vs 7 days and 107 vs 105 pfu/ml, respectively). 13/16 vaccinia-primed subjects inoculated with HIVAC-le developed transient in vitro T-cell proliferative responses to one or more HIV antigen preparations. No antibodies to HIV were detectable. The 2 vaccinia-naive A-Z OF TREATMENTS 155 [Page 156](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/162?q1=directories) subjects vaccinated with HIVAC-le showed strong T-cell responses to homologous and heterologous strains of whole virus and to recombinant gpl 60 protein that remained detectable for over a year; antibodies to HIV envelope also developed in both.

AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 8(8): 1992. * HEPT derivatives HEPT derivatives are nucleoside analogues - the family of anti-HIV drugs to which AZT, ddl and ddC also belong. These drugs act by inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme, but HEPT derivatives seem to inhibit the enzyme in a different way from AZT, ddl and ddC. Their mechanism of action may be similar to that of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as TIBOL and nevirapine. Current use HEPT derivatives are unlicensed, experimental drugs which have not yet been tested in humans. Test-tube results suggest that the compounds may be effective against AZT-resistant virus and are unlikely to harm the bone marrow as AZT can. Key research HEPT derivatives are a series of acyclouridine derivatives with substitutions at the C-6 position. They appear to inhibit HIV-1 through direct interaction with the HIV reverse transcriptase. They do not require phosphorylation to exhibit anti-HIV activity and they do not inhibit HIV-2 or any other retroviruses. The investigators speculate that the HEPT derivatives have a common mechanism of action with the benzodiazepine derivatives TIBO/TIBOL compounds and BI-RG-587. Baba (1990) reported that in vitro, HEPT and its analogue HEPT-S inhibited HIV-1 replication by 50% in MT-4 cells at concentrations of 6.5 and 1.6 mM respectively and inhibited cell viability by 50% at 740 mM. Ito reported that in vitro HEPT and alpha interferon synergistically inhibit HIV-1 replication. Baba (1991a) and Tanaka have since reported on new 5-ethyl derivatives with in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity in the nanomolar range. The ICsos for one such compound (E-EBU-dM,5-ethyl-1 -ethoxymethyl-6-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)ur-acil were 2.2 and 0.45 nM in MT-4 cells and PBL, respectively. These concentrations were more than 100,000 times less than the 50% cytotoxic concentration. E-EBU-dM specifically acted on the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. These derivatives are active in vitro against clinical AZT-resistant HIV-1 isolates. Baba (1991 b) reported that in vitro the 5-ethyl derivative E-EPU and AZT synergistically inhibit HIV-1 replication. Baba (1993) found that although all HEPT derivatives proved to be highly potent inhibitors of HIV-1 in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, some of them were less inhibitory to HIV-1 replication in the presence of human serum. The HEPT derivatives were found to be highly bound to human serum proteins. Both the anti-HIV-1 activity and human serum protein binding of the compounds appeared to be related to their lipophilicity. The pharmacokinetic behaviour of HEPT derivatives was studied in rats. The drug was about 40% bioavailable. A dose of 20 mg/kg resulted in a mean plasma drug concentration of 22.8 mM, the LDs0 was greater than 2000 mg/kg. HEPT in vitro did not harm bone marrow cells at concentrations 20 times greater than that at which AZT is significantly toxic. HEPT was not inhibitory to T-lymphoblast MOLT/4F cell proliferation at the same concentration. References Baba M et al.

In people with HIV, antibodies to pl 7 usually appear soon after infection but gradually disappear as the disease progresses. One theory is that those antibodies help protect against HIV's harmful effects. HGP-30 is an artificially manufactured copy of the pl 7 protein made by genetic engineering techniques. The theory is that by injecting this protein into people who are already infected with HIV, the immune system may be stimulated to produce higher levels of anti-pi 7 antibodies as well as cellular responses against not only HGP-30 but also the 'real' protein found in HIV particles. HGP-30 is also being investigated as a preventive vaccine to protect uninfected people. Current use Phase I studies of HGP-30 in 38 healthy HIV-negative volunteers in London, San Francisco and Los Angeles suggested that the vaccine is well-tolerated and induces antibodies and cytotoxic T-cells. Further Phase I studies in HIV-positive and HIV-negative volunteers have been planned to begin in the USA in early 1995. Key research HGP-30 is a recombinantly produced portion of the pl 7 gag core protein of HIV-1. It is coupled with a keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) carrier and an alum adjuvant. HGP-30 is being studied as an HIV vaccine for non-infected people and as immunotherapy in HIV-positive asymptomatic people. Achour observed that in vitro when immortalised B cell lines from HIV-positive individuals were pulsed with HGP-30, HIV-specific CTLs were generated in autologous mixed lymphocyte culture. Stambuk conducted a phase I study in which 19 HIV-negative male volunteers were injected intramuscularly with escalating doses (10, 25, 50 pg/kg) of HGP-30. A total of 3 injections were given at weeks 0, 6, 14 to participants divided in 3 dose-related groups and monitored two -weekly for evidence of toxicity for a median period of 18 weeks. Among 15 who completed the study the only adverse event was pain at the injection site. 6/15 (40%) developed reactivity to p1 7 and/or p24 on Western Blot. Kahn administered HGP-30 in alum to HIV-negative volunteers at doses of 10, 25, 50 and 100 pg/kg intramuscularly at weeks 0, 4 and 10. The only clinical toxicity was local pain at the injection site. Laboratory parameters were not affected by vaccine candidate except for mild urinalysis abnormalities at the highest dose. Low levels and transient antibodies developed in a minority of participants early after immunization, including in the lowest dose range. There was preliminary evidence of an HGP-30-induced CTL response of HGP-30-coated EBV-transformed autologous B cell lines. Willer studied the response of HIV-positive individuals infected with HIV to HGP-30 at various stages of disease progression. A PBMC proliferative response to HGP-30 was seen in 40% of the healthy seroconverted patients, in 35% of the CDC stage III patients and in 18% of the CDC stage IV patients. There was no correlation between the proliferative response to HGP-30 and other antigens or to CD4 cell count. References Achour A et al.

Unlike other vaccine preparations under study, such as gp120 and gp160, which consist of individual viral proteins, HIV-lmmunogen is made from whole HIV particles which have had their envelope layer stripped off and have been made harmless by chemical and radiation sterilisation. The theory is that by injecting these particles into people who are already infected with HIV, the immune system may be stimulated to mount a greater immune response not only to the killed HIV particles but also to real virus particles and HIV-infected cells. Because it is based on whole inactivated virus, this vaccine could theoretically stimulate broader immune responses that are capable of suppressing more diverse HIV strains than vaccine preparations based on single sub-unit proteins of the virus. HIV-lmmunogen has been developed by Jonas Salk, discoverer of the polio vaccine. It is sometimes referred to as the Salk vaccine. Current use Clinical trials have suggested that vaccine injections every three months reduced the levels of detectable HIV in the blood immediately after vaccination and led to improvements in the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) test, which reflects the healthiness of the cellular immune system. Researchers have also reported on 23 people who first received the vaccine five years ago. Twelve of them showed a response to the vaccine as measured by the DTH test; of them, only one has since developed an opportunistic infection and none has died. Of the eleven who did not respond to the vaccine, opportunistic infections occurred in five and three have died. However, these results do not necessarily show that the vaccine worked; it is quite possible that the people who seemed to respond to the vaccine were those who were healthier and were therefore less likely to experience disease progression regardless of whether they took the vaccine or not. No side-effects from HIV-lmmunogen have been reported. Getting it HIV-lmmunogen is only accessible through clinical trials, which are ongoing in the USA. It is not under study in Britain. Key research Levine (1990) enrolled 86 people (19 people with ARC, 54 asymptomatic people, 13 HIV-infected AZT recipients) in a phase I/11 study of HIV-Immunogen intramuscularly. 45 subjects have completed the study. With a median follow-up of 2.5 years since inoculation, no significant immunological or virological effects were observed. 10 subjects progressed to AIDS. 4 people with ARC developed PCP, 6 subjects developed KS; other subjects reportedly remain clinically stable. An extension phase of the study is under way. Participants electing to continue treatment receive HIV-Immunogen boosters on day 0 and 180. Levine (1993) reported on 23 participants in this trial who were followed for five years. No serious adverse events were reported, nor was accelerated HIV disease progression seen. 12/25 who developed a cellular immunologic response as determined by DTH tests were defined as responders. Of these, only one developed an opportunistic infection, occurring five years from study onset and none have died. Of the 11 participants who had no HIV-DTH response, Ols occurred in 5 and 3 died. Trauger enrolled 103 asymptomatic people with CD4 counts above 550 in a double-blind, adjuvant-controlled trial of HIV-1 Immunogen. Three doses of 100 pg HIV-1 Immunogen in incomplete Freunds adjuvant (IFA), or IFA A-Z OF TREATMENTS 157 [Page 158](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/164?q1=directories) alone, were given intramuscularly at 0, 3 and 6 months. Significant differences in cell-mediated immune responses to HIV-1 and p24 antigen were observed between the treated and control groups. Compared with controls, treated participants as a group had a significantly lower rate of increase in viral DNA as determined by quantitative PCR. Significant differences in the rate of decline of percent CD4 cell were also observed. References Levine AM et al.

It activates protein production in muscle cells and the release of energy from fats. A genetically engineered (or recombinant) version of human growth hormone has been produced. Test-tube experiments have shown that it can stimulate immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, which are related to tumour control and T-cells. However, it can also stimulate HIV replication, suggesting that it should be taken alongside anti-retroviral drugs. It is also being studied as a treatment for HIV-related wasting. A Phase III study among people who had lost at least 10% of their body weight has reported promising preliminary results, with participants showing significant increases in lean body mass (i.e. muscle) in people with wasting syndrome. Other nutritional interventions such as appetite stimulation and nutritional support tend to increase body weight due to the accumulation of fat. An increase in lean body mass is thought to be much more important since studies have shown that people who lose lean body mass are at increased risk of dying. Following the presentation of promising trial results at the 10th International Conference on AIDS in Yokohama in August 1994, the manufacturer of one brand of human growth hormone has applied for it to be formally licensed as a treatment for wasting. For more information see the entry on Wasting syndrome. Recombinant human growth hormone (sometimes abbreviated to rHGH) is also known as somatrem, and is produced by various manufacturers under the tradenames Genotropin, Humatrope, Norditropin, Protropin and Saizen. Current use The use of human growth hormone as a treatment for people with HIV is currently still unlicensed and experimental. Early studies have suggested that the drug may stabilise weight or reverse weight loss in people with HIV. Side-effects can include headache, muscle pain, oedema (abnormal accumulation of fluid beneath the skin), salt and water retention and rare instances of carpal tunnel syndrome (pain or tingling in the first three or four fingers of the hand). Children treated with the drug over the long-term develop antibodies to it, but these do not seem to have any harmful effects. In experimental SCID mice (mice which are born with no immune system and then have a human immune system 'transplanted'), human growth hormone increased the ability of T-cells to travel to lymph organs, which increased the risk of B-cell lymphoma in those infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Human growth hormone is given as a subcutaneous injection. Getting it Recombinant human growth hormone is a licensed treatment that can be prescribed on the NHS for treating children with short stature as a result of growth hormone deficiency. However, it is not licensed for prescribing to people with HIV. Trials of the drug as an HIV/AIDS treatment are continuing, but none in Britain. Current developments Many of the effects of human growth hormone are thought to be brought about by the hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which the growth hormone stimulates. This hormone has itself been artificially produced using recombinant genetic engineering techniques and is being tested as a treatment for wieght loss. Reported side-effects occur mainly at high doses and include hypoglycaemia and jaw tenderness. Research on immune modulation Laurence reported that in vitro rHGH enhanced viral replication in acutely infected PBMC. The investigators, while noting that the clinical relevance of these in vitro results is not clear, suggested that RHGH should only be used in conjunction with anti-retroviral treatment in HIV-infected people. Murphy (1992a) reported that rHGH had haematopoietic growth-promoting effects and was able to alleviate some of the myelosuppressive effects of AZT in SCID mice. Kelley (1986) reported that thymus glands were regenerated when GH3 pituitary adenoma cells, which secrete growth hormone (as well as prolactin and other substances), were implanted into aged rats with thymic atrophy. T-cell proliferative responses were also enhanced compared to controls. The same group (1989, 1990) also showed that exogenous rHGH alone enhanced T cell proliferative responses in aged rats. Since rHGH did not increase thymus-gland growth in this experiment, the investigators speculated that rHGH directly enhances T-cell proliferation by increasing the synthesis of growth factors or receptors involved in T-cell activation. Crist reported that exogenous rHGH treatment augmented natural killer cell activity in women with impaired rHGH secretion. Snow demonstrated that in vitro, rHGH increases cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity. Edwards showed that in vitro, rHGH activates produce (02-). Durum used rHGH to mice combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which lack CD4 and CD8 cells. After three days treatment with rHGH, CD4/CD8 single positive cells were detected in the thymus. Treatment with IL-2 did not produce this effect. Murphy (1992b) reported that in SCID mice rHGH activated human T-cells and increased their ability to traffic to the peripheral lymphoid organs, which in those infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) resulted in increased incidence of B-cell lymphoma. 158 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 159](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/165?q1=directories) References Crist DM et al.

Hydroxyurea Hydroxyurea is an approved oral drug used mainly for treating a form of leukaemia. Test-tube studies have shown that it inhibits HIV replication and is synergistic with AZT and ddl. It crosses the blood-brain barrier. The most common side-effects when used for treating leukaemia can include bone marrow suppression, nausea and skin reactions. Two Phase II trials are currently underway in France. References Lori F et al. Hydroxyurea as a novel potent inhibitor of HIV- I 7994. * Hypericin derived from the herb Hypericum triquetrifolium Turra (St John's wort, also known as goatweed). As well as a natural extract that can bought in health food shops, researchers have developed a synthetic version. In the test-tube hypericin inhibits the production of new virus particles from the surface of infected cells. It may also inhibit HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme, although this effect was only seen in cells exposed to visible light. Studies in mice infected with a retrovirus (FV) found that hypericin dramatically improved survival. The synthetic hypericin reduced the levels of detectable HIV in samples of blood taken from HIV-positive people. Herbal preparations of hypericin, containing 0.14% hypericin, are sold under the names Hyperforat and Psychotonin; they are said to have anti-depressant properties. A stronger preparation containing 4.4% is available from buyers' clubs under the tradename HY10 or HY4. The synthetic formulation is called VIMRxyn and produced by the company VIMRx. Current use Hypericin is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Initial studies using the St John's Wort extract (which contains only about 0.14% of the active agent) found no evidence of benefit to people with HIV. A phase I study of increasing doses of synthetic hypericin found no clear evidence of antiviral effects before dose-escalation had to be stopped due to phototoxicity. This is the major side-effect from hypericin; it causes a tingling or burning sensation in the skin on exposure to sunlight or a hypersensitivity to cold or hot. This side-effect is reversible when hypericin is stopped. Phase I/I1 trials of synthetic hypericin are underway. Abnormalities in liver function have occurred in patients taking over-the-counter herbal preparations. Getting it Herbal preparations of hypericin (0.14%) are available in most health food shops. The higher concentration herbal preparation, containing 4.4% hypericin, is also available through buyers' clubs. Synthetic hypericin is only available through clinical trials, none of which are taking place in Britain. Key research Degar reported that HIV that had been treated with hypericin was unable to infect human cells in vitro; reverse transcriptase activity could not be released from hypericin-treated virions. These effects were only seen when HIV was exposed to hypericin in the presence of visible light. Hudson and Lenard independently reported that visible light was needed; an light-independent effect of hypericin was only seen at concentrations approaching those which were toxic to human cells. Takahashi reported that hypericin and pseudohypericin inhibit protein kinase C (PKC) in vitro and suggested that the antiretroviral activity of the compounds may be attributable to the inhibition of phosphorylation by PKC during viral infection of cells. Meruelo administered 100 pg hypericin extracted from Hypericum triquetrifolium in a single dose to mice 24 hours after experimental infection with Freund leukaemia virus (FV). Treated mice survived longer than 240 days after infection as compared to 15-30 days for untreated controls. Valentine demonstrated that synthetic hypericin enters lymphocytes and macrophages in vitro. In addition, hypericin decreases culturable HIV in vitro in whole blood obtained from HIV-infected individuals. St. John's wort: Payne treated 60 early ARC patients in a six-month, four-arm trial of Yerba Prima St. John's wort tablets (standardised at 0.14% hypericin) with or without AZT. 25 patients completed 6 months of therapy. (Most patients were lost to follow-up.) No improvement in CD4, CD8, or p24 antigen levels were seen in any of the groups. Cooper reported on an observational study in which 26 people with HIV took 4 months of self-administered hypericin herbal extracts available over-the-counter (approximately 1 mg per day). Concomitant use of AZT and other treatments was permitted. Toxicities were limited to reversible liver enzyme elevations in 5 participants; all levels returned to baseline after 1 month without hypericin. P24 antigenaemia disappeared in 2/6 initially positive participants, both also using AZT. CD4 changes differed depending on AZT usage. In the 1 0 patients who took no AZT either before or during the study (none had AIDS), the mean CD4 count increased 13 percent from baseline after 1 month on hypericin and maintained this increase for 4 months. These increases were not statistically significant. By contrast, CD4 counts of those using AZT throughout the study (N =10) fell significantly after an initial mild rise. No change occurred in beta2-microglobulin, or delayed hypersensitivity by Merieux testing. Furner reported findings from an observational study in which four levels of hypericin (0.5 mg, 2.0 mg, 4.0 mg and 8.0 mg) were administered to A-Z OF TREATMENTS 159 [Page 160](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/166?q1=directories) cohorts of 10 HIV-infected persons each for a period of 12 weeks. Preliminary analysis on the first two cohorts revealed that possible toxicities include mild diarrhoea and indigestion, an infrequent itchy mainly trunkal rash and fatigue/depression. An idiosyncratic, reversible elevation of hepatic transaminases was observed. No early, marked anti-HIV activity was found. Synthetic hypericin: McAuliffe enrolled 25 HIV-positive people with CD4 counts below 300 in ACTG150 - a phase I study of intravenous synthetic hypericin (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg twice a week or 0.25 mg/kg three times a week). Phototoxicity varying in severity developed in all participants and was dose-limiting at 0.5 mg/kg twice weekly. No consistent change in viral endpoints was seen. 4 individuals received a single oral dose; bioavailability was 22.3 +/- 7.7%, suggesting that chronic oral dosing should achieve sustained blood levels in an antiretroviral range. Gulick conducted phototesting and determined that the smallest amount of visible light that would produce erythema in these patients declined from more than 56 joules/cm2 before hypericin treatment to 18 joules/cm2 after hypericin treatment. Steinbeck-Klose enrolled 18 people in an open label 40 month pilot study of hypericin (2 intravenous infusion of 2 ml per week, plus 2 tablets 3 times daily). 16/18 showed improvements in CD4 counts and CD4/CD8 ratio. Of these 16, only two developed Ols during treatment. No side-effects were observed. Cooper reported that reversible elevated liver function tests are associated with over-the-counter hypericin-containing extracts (St. John's wort). References Cooper WC et al.

It is being tested as an immune modulator and enhances production of the cytokines interleukin-2 and gamma interferon from blood cells in the test-tube. Current use IMREG-1 is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Several studies in people with mild symptomatic HIV infection have suggested that it delays progression to more serious disease and improves laboratory markers. Other trials are underway. There are no apparent side-effects. Key research Fiala conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, six-month trial of IMREG-1 in 45 anergic people with ARC and 4 with Kaposi's sarcoma, which was followed by compassionate IMREG-1 administration to all participants. The IMREG-1 group had significantly less AIDS-defining events compared with the placebo group during the randomized trial (6.9 events per 100 person-years vs 43.7 events per 100 person-years, relative risk 6.33) and the total observation period. Patients receiving IMREG-1 significantly improved their work performance. 9/22 (41%) participants in the IMREG-1 group, compared with 1/7 (14%) in the placebo group, recovered cutaneous reactivity to tetanus toxoid. At the end of the six-month trial, CD4 counts were 429 in the IMREG-1 group and 304 in the placebo group. Gottlieb enrolled 143 patients with ARC in a multi-centre placebo-controlled trial. Patients who received IMREG 1 had a lower incidence of opportunistic infections including PCP and of other serious complications of HIV infection than those who received placebo (5/95 vs. 12/48). Patients treated with IMREG-1 also had a slower loss of CD4 cells and an increased size and rate of delayed hypersensitivity response. 44 IMREG-1 -treated participants with less than 100% ideal body weight (IBW) at baseline showed a trend to an increase in IBW of 1.2% compared to an increase of 0.48% for placebo; 25/44 (57%) gained two or more pounds compared with 6/23 (26%) for placebo. 24 participants with diarrhoea during the trial and less than IBW at baseline who received IMREG-1 had an increased trend in IBW of 1.44% compared to an increase of 0.16% in 9 placebo recipients; 14/24 (58%) gained 2 or more pounds compared with 2/9 (22%) for placebo. 23 patients with candidiasis during the trial and less than IBW who received IMREG-1 had a trend to an increase of 0.72% in IBW compared to no increase in 13 placebo recipients; 11/23 (48%) gained two or more pounds compared with 2/13 (15%) of placebo controls.

It is thought to work either by stimulating the liver to produce a hormone-like substance called hepatosin, or by acting as an anti-oxidant and reducing levels of substances that stimulate HIV replication, such as the protein NF-kB. Imuthiol is the tradename of the drug produced by Pasteur-M6rieux. It is also known as ditiocarb or ditiocarb sodium, sometimes abbreviated to DTC. Current use Very limited data suggested that intravenous use of imuthiol in people with early HIV infection delayed progression to more serious disease. However, in 1991 data was released 160 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 161](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/167?q1=directories) from the largest, placebo-controlled trial of imuthiol, in which 1650 asymptomatic French participants were followed for two years. Although no significant side-effects were seen, neither was any treatment benefit observed. If anything, people who received imuthiol were slightly more likely to progress to AIDS than those taking the placebo. The trial was also hindered by a high rate of discontinuation or interruption of therapy (50%), which made the intention-to-treat analysis difficult the protocol allowed for interruption of treatment if progression occurred. As a result, Pasteur-Merieux immediately cancelled all further development plans and withdrew imuthiol from New Zealand where it was marketed and the countries in which it was available for compassionate use. In June 1992, following further laboratory tests indicating that imuthiol may indeed have anti-oxidant effects, Pasteur-Merieux have recommitted funds to research. Side-effects include a metallic taste, abdominal discomfort, fatigue and nausea. Taking it Imuthiol comes as a white powder that is dissolved in water. People who are taking imuthiol should avoid alcohol. When alcohol is taken nausea, vomiting and fever occur rapidly. This is due to the similarity of the molecule to that of disulfiram (Antabuse) a compound used for alcohol withdrawal. Some people have taken disulfiram as an anti-HIV drug but the only controlled trial to date found no difference between disulfiram and placebo. Key research In July 1991, it was reported that the clinical investigation of DTC had been suspended following a preliminary analysis of a 2-year double-blind placebo controlled trial of 1600 HIV-positive asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic people in France conducted by the HIV87 study group. Participants were followed for 24 months with a clinical and laboratory evaluation every 4 months. AIDS developed in 106 patients in the DTC group compared with 68 in the placebo group; 285 participants progressed to ARC (157 DTC, 128 placebo); 55 participants died (34 DTC, 21 placebo). The risk of progression to AIDS, after adjustment for baseline CD4 cell count, was significantly higher in the DTC than in the placebo group. CD4 cell counts declined to a similar extent in DTC and placebo recipients. Hersh compared DTC (400 mg/m2 by mouth once a week) to placebo in 387 HIV patients. After 24 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of additional follow-up, 7/191 DTC-treated patients and 19/196 placebo recipients discontinued treatment due to disease progression. While there were 56% fewer opportunistic infections in the DTC group (10 opportunistic infections in DTC recipients and 21 opportunistic infections in placebo recipients), equal numbers of patients died (8 in each group). Average CD4 cell counts remained stable in both groups. Lang enrolled 83 people with HIV (CDC groups II, III, or IV-A) in a randomised crossover trial of DTC (10 mg/kg/week orally) versus placebo. Each arm of the trial lasted 16 weeks. No progressions to AIDS were seen in the DTC group but 4 placebo recipients developed AIDS. DTC was also associated to a significantly greater extent than placebo with relief of constitutional symptoms, improvement in clinical status (including shrinkage of enlarged spleen and lymph nodes) and improvement in immune function (as measured by CD4 cell count and skin test reactivity). When placebo was replaced by DTC, similar improvements were observed, whereas symptoms slowly reappeared and CD4 cell levels progressively declined when DTC treatment was replaced by placebo. Reisinger compared intravenously administered DTC (5 mg/kg once a week), oral DTC (10 mg/kg once a week) and placebo in 60 early ARC patients in a matched-pair placebo-controlled study. Among the 55 patients evaluable after 24 weeks' treatment, 6 placebo recipients and no DTC recipients had progressed to AIDS. While intravenous DTC was reported to significantly delay progression to AIDS, the difference in progression rates between the oral DTC and placebo groups was not statistically significant. After 18 months' follow-up, 3 patients in the placebo group died, while none of the original DTC recipients died. Vanham conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study in which 50 HIV-positive people at all clinical disease stages received either DTC or placebo for 4 months. No effects on CD4 or CD8 T-cell counts or on CD8 T-cell activation markers were seen except for a selective increase in HLA-DR expressing CD8 cells in the DTC-treated group. No effect on HIV antigen and anti-p24 antibody titres was observed. The incidence of clinical complications was similar in each group. Cotte reported that DTC had no effect on reverse transcriptase activity or p24 antigenaemia among 14 HIV-positive people with CDC stage II or III disease treated with 10 mg/kg/week for 16 weeks. In April 1990 the FDA denied the manufacturer's application for Treatment IND status (expanded-access availability) for Imuthiol. In October 1990, DTC was approved for the treatment of HIV infection in New Zealand. Hrding treated 15 HIV-positive men with CD4 count below 500 or a 50% reduction in lymphoproliferative response to pokeweed mitogen in a pilot study of disulfiram (100 mg/day or 400 mg/day) versus placebo. No differences between the groups were observed in immunological, haematological or biochemical parameters. Side-effects included foul breath, stomach pain and headache. References Cotte L et al.

It is thought to stimulate produdion of the cytokine gamma interferon, Natural Killer (NK) cells and subsets of T-cells. Studies have shown that levels of IL-2 tend to fall below normal after an indiviual becomes infected with HIV, and decreased levels of interleukin-2 have been shown to be associated with increased risk of disease progression. Several research teams are studying whether it is beneficial to treat people with HIV with a man-made (recombinant) form of IL-2. However, interleukin-2 is also a very efficient trigger of HIV replication, because when it activates T-cells it also activates HIV-infected T-cells. For this reason, interleukin-2 has been tested in trials in combination with AZT, to suppress the HIV activation. In laboratory experiments, interleukin-2 improved the survival of animals deliberately infected with toxoplasmosis. Recombinant interleukin-2 is also known by the abbreviation IL-2, or as aldesleukin. It is marketed by the company EuroCetus under the tradename Proleukin. Current use Several early studies have found that interleukin-2 can increase the CD4 count in people with counts above 200 and may also stimulate cellular immune responses. A form of interleukin-2 called PEG-IL-2, which remains in the body for longer, is being tested in combination with AZT and alpha thymosin (a thymic peptide) in the USA. A-Z OF TREATMENTS 161 [Page 162](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/168?q1=directories) Side-effects are substantial and include haematological toxicity (neutropenia and anaemia), chills, fevers, muscle pains, nausea, diarrhoea and abnormal liver and kidney function. People taking standard doses of Proleukin (600,000 international units/kg every 8 hours) should also receive close medical supervision within a clinic with intensive care facilities. A phase I trial of lower doses of Proleukin in people with HIV is underway in San Francisco. Use in combinations Several studies have investigated the combination of interleukin-2 plus AZT. In general, these showed increases in CD4 counts when interleukin-2 was started and found no indications of increased HIV replication. However, to date trials to test for clinical advantages to the combination, such as fewer opportunistic infections or prolonged survival, have not taken place. A 1989 study of interleukin-2 plus beta interferon found that participants' KS was worsened by the combination, possibly because too high a dose of interleukin-2 was used. Getting it Interleukin-2 is a licensed drug for treating a form of kidney cancer. Its use in people with HIV is unlicensed and experimental. No clinical trials of interleukin-2, on its own or in combinations, are taking place in Britain. Current developments Researchers are testing a genetically engineered molecule called IL-2 fusion toxin. This is also known by the code-name DAB3891L-2 and is manufactured by Seragen Inc. Studies have suggested that HIV is more likely to activate in infected cells that carry a receptor for interleukin-2. The theory behind IL-2 fusion toxin is that it will bind to cells which carry the IL-2 receptor and then kill them with the diphtheria toxin incorporated into the molecule. In test-tube studies, IL-2 fusion toxin selectively kills HIV-infected cells or without harming uninfected cells. Trials in people are underway in the USA; to date no serious side-effects or worsening of disease has been seen. Key research Volberding administered IL-2 (doses ranging from 1000 to 2 million units/m2 intravenously three times weekly for eight weeks) to 87 people with AIDS divided into two groups by the presence or absence of Kaposi's sarcoma. Toxicity at high doses consisted of flu-like symptoms and hypotension at highest doses. Partial objective tumour regression was observed in 3 people with Kaposi's sarcoma. 17 participants had progression of disease (new opportunistic infection or increase in Kaposi's sarcoma) during therapy. No improvement in immunologic status was observed. Waites enrolled 50 HIV-positive people, 25 with 200 CD4 cells (Group A) and 25 patients with 200 CD4 (Group B) in a study of escalating doses of PEG IL-2 subcutaneously, starting with 50,000 units and increasing to 1 million units weekly for the first 2 weeks of a 4 week cycle for up to 28 weeks. Participants had dose dependent cycling of CD4s and CD8s with most showing rises in their CD4 and CD8 counts one week after dosing. There was a statistically significant improvement in CD4 with increasing dose for Group A patients. Group A patients receiving greater than or equal to 750,000 units/dose had an average increase of 58 cells/cycle but returned each cycle to their baseline. There was no evidence of viral activation as judged by p24 and beta2-microglobulin. Only one of the fifty patients developed an opportunistic infection during the course of the trial, although patients in Group B did not show consistent rises in their CD4 counts. Kovacs (1993) treated 10 individuals with CD4 counts above 200 with continuous infusion IL-2 (6-18 million international units/day for 5 days every 8 weeks) for 4 to 18 months. 7 participants showed a sustained CD4 increase. Measurements of CD4 function (responses to pokeweed mitogen and tetanus toxoid) also showed improvement in some participants. No changes in p24 antigen levels or plasma viraemia were seen although increases in HIV RNA were detected in 4 participants at the end of each infusion, peaking 1-2 days after completion of IL-2 and rapidly returning to baseline. Teppler (1993a) treated 13 asymptomatic HIV-positive people with 6 Pg polyethylene glycol recombinant human interleukin 2 (PEG IL-2) intradermally twice a week for 4 months. No local or systemic toxicity occurred. No increase in the viral burden of circulating leukocytes or plasma occurred. All patients demonstrated high levels of lymphokine-activated killer cell activity by cells freshly removed from the circulation and in the absence of in vitro exposure to IL-2. Natural killer cell activity was also enhanced. Limiting dilution analysis revealed an increase in the frequency of IL-2-responsive cells from abnormally low to levels above normal during the course of injections. In a subgroup of four patients with CD4 counts of at least 400 at entry, there was a trend to sustained increases in CD4 count. Teppler (1993b) treated 8 HIV-positive men with low-dose IL-2 (10 pg or 180,000 units) or its polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivative (9 ig or 36,000 units) by intracutaneous injection for 30 days. Participants had no evidence of opportunistic infection and received concurrent zidovudine. IL-2 treatment was nontoxic and elicited a local cellular response resembling classic delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) with local interferon-gamma production, even in anergic patients. Systemic responses included enhanced DTH responses to recall antigens, improved in vitro proliferative responses to mitogen and enhanced NK cell activity. Peripheral leukocyte phenotype and virus titres were unchanged. McElrath report that 11 HIV-positive people including 3 people with AIDS were able to generate a cellular immune response to the intradermal injection of low doses (2-10 pg) of IL-2. A dose-dependent zone of induration appeared at the site of injection, peaked at 24 hr and was accompanied by the local accumulation of T-cells, monocytes and Langerhans cells. In response to IL-2, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen was expressed on the surface of keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, lymphocytes and macrophages. The simultaneous administration of rlL-2 and soluble antigen at widely separated cutaneous sites led to an enhancement of skin-test antigen reactivity in seropositive patients. The results suggest that local administration of rlL-2 to seropositive patients may act systemically, stimulating cellular immunity to recall antigens and thus may be of potential benefit in the defence against opportunistic pathogens encountered in HIV-1 infection. McMahon enrolled 16 symptomatic HIV-positive individuals in a phase I study of the combination of subcutaneous IL-2 and AZT (ACTG 067). All participants received AZT (600-1200 mg/day) with 6 each receiving either IL-2 (200,000 units/m2 subcutaneously every day) or IL-2 (700,000 units/m2 subcutaneously every day) and 4 receiving IL-2 (2 million units/m subcutaneously every day) for 5 consecutive days. 11-2 was well-tolerated at the highest dose except for two individuals who developed significant lymphopenia. CD4, CD8, eosinophil and natural kill cell counts remained above baseline for up to 10 weeks. No clear effect on p24 levels, qualitative viral cultures or quantitative HIV titres were seen. Wood treated 19 HIV-positive people with polyethylene glycolated (PEG) IL-2 plus AZT in a phase 1/11 open-label dose-ranging study. During courses of three weeky infusions of PEG IL-2, dose-limiting side-effects were seen at 5 x 106 IU/m and reversible encephalopathy in 1 participant at 3 x 106 IU/m2. Significant increases were seen in CD4 cell counts, NK cell activity and HIV-specific cytotoxicity. Virologic monitoring (quantitative DNA polymerase chain reaction and p24 antigen assay) showed no evidence of increased HIV activation. Patients with CD4 counts below 200 were entered into a chronic dosing phase. PEG IL-2 was given at 14-day intervals at doses of 106 IU/m2 for 8 weeks and 3 x 10 IU/m2 for up to 16 weeks, resulting in mean CD4 cell count elevations of 16% and 33%, respectively. Clark performed quantification of HIV proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 13 HIV-positive asymptomatic individuals during 10-24 months. In 4 untreated individuals there was no significant change in provirus levels during a mean period of 13.3 months. In 8 patients treated with AZT and IL-2, HIV provirus copies declined to 13 per 106 cells after 20 weeks and to 40 per 106 cells after 12 months of treatment. Subsequent courses which included 12 weeks of AZT alone or 4 weeks of IL-2 alone did not significantly change the already depressed provirus copy numbers. Proviral copy number also remained depressed during drug-free 'washout periods between courses. A return to a geometric mean of 400 copies per 106 cells was observed a mean of 7.9 months after discontinuation of therapy. Schwartz enrolled 10 HIV-positive people with CD4 counts above 400 in a phase I study of the combination of IL-2 and AZT. Participants received AZT (1200 mg/day) initially for 8 weeks, then IL-2 (1.5 million units/m2 daily) administered by continuous IV for 4 weeks. Participants were permitted to repeat the treatment cycle if they completed an 8-week washout period. An increase in CD4 count was noted during the first 2 weeks of IL-2 alone administration. However, this increase was not sustained during the next 2 weeks of IL-2. There was no indication of any change in viraemia or antigenaemia during the treatment period. 162 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 163](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/169?q1=directories) Mazza treated 12 people with lymphoma and HIV with AZT (600 mg/day) and IL-2 (6 million units/m over 5 days in continuous infusion per week for a total 4 courses) in a phase II study. Participants with baseline CD4 counts above 100 had 2-4 fold increases accompanied by a significant increase of NK and LAK activity. Reduction of tumour manifestation was proportional to baseline CD4 count. p24 antigen remained invariably negative after rlL-2 and ZDV in patients already negative and became negative in 1 patient previously positive. Krigel reported that in a phase II study in people with KS the combination of interleukin-2 (5 million Cetus units/m ) plus beta interferon exacerbated the KS. The investigators speculated that the dose used may have been too high. Bartlett enrolled 13 HIV-positive patients in a phase 1/11 AZT/IL-2 study, with escalating doses of either IL-2 (100,000 units/m2, 300,000 units/m2 or 1 million units/m2 intravenously every day). Kovacs (1989) enrolled patients in another study of the combination, using IL-2 doses increasing from 250,000 units/day, until the maximum tolerated dose was determined. Their results confirmed the findings of Schwartz, with no changes in viraemia or antigenaemia or any specific anti-HIV activity and CD4 cell count increases during the IL-2 infusion period. IL-2 fusion toxin (code-named DAB3891L-2) is a genetically engineered molecule which includes the enzymatic site and translocation domain of the diphtheria toxin and the receptor-binding domain of IL-2. The protein is expressed in E. coli. Bohnlein demonstrated in vitro that HIV activation in infected T cells is associated with the expression of high-affinity IL-2 receptors. The IL-2 fusion toxin selectively binds these receptors. The enzymatically active domain of the diphtheria toxin, which inhibits protein synthesis and causes cell death, is then delivered to the cell. Finberg reported that in vitro, IL-2 fusion toxin selectively clears HIV- 1 IIIB-infected cells from mixed cultures of infected and uninfected CD4 cells. IL-2 fusion toxin (at 10.8 to 10.7 p concentration) was added twice weekly. HIV-1 infected cells were cleared from culture by 15 days at both concentrations. The viability of uninfected cells was unaffected. Zhang reported that IL-2 fusion toxin inhibited HIV-1111B RNA production in PBMC. The ICso was 2.45 x 10-10 M. IL-2 fusion toxin also inhibited viral RNA production by clinical isolates of HIV-1. The ICso range against these isolates was 10 9 to 10-7 M. Ives conducted a phase 1/11 dose-ranging trial of DAB3891L-2 in 24 people with CD4 counts between 300 and 600. No statistically significant effect on viral culture, serum p24 antigen levels or HIV RNA was seen. One participant receiving 200 kU/kg/day did experience significant reductions in these measures. CD4 measures remained stable. Mild reversible transaminase elevations were the most common adverse effect. References Bartlett J et al.

JAIDS 5:1181-1187, Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a natural chemical, or cytokine, produced by T-helper cells to activate and recruit the constituent parts of the immune system. Since HIV depletes the levels of cells of the immune system, treatment with extra interleukin-3 might be beneficial. However, interleukin-3 also triggers HIV replication, because when it activates CD4 cells it also activates HIV-infected CD4 cells. For this reason, interleukin-3 should probably only be used in combination with antiretroviral drugs such as AZT. IL-3 is the name given to interleukin-3 produced artificially by genetic engineering. Current use Interleukin-3 is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Research is still in very early stages. Tests with mice indicate that it may worsen AZT-related side-effects of anaemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. The drug is administered by subcutaneous injection. Side-effects from interleukin-3 include mild fever, headache, flushing and skin irritation at the site of injection. Current developments Researchers are studying an experimental intravenous compound called PIXY 321, which combines the active parts of GM-CSF and interleukin-3. In vitro the two separate substances have a synergistic effect in stimulating the growth of blood cells. It is hoped that PIXY 321 may turn out to be an effective treatment for pancytopenia (shortage of all blood cells). Key research In vitro studies have shown that IL-3 supports the growth of very early haematopoietic progenitor cells and exhibits synergistic activity with other haematopoietic growth factors such as EPO, GM-CSF and G-CSF. Schuitemaker reported that like GM-CSF, IL-3 augmented HIV replication in monocytes. However, AZT concentrations sufficient for complete inhibition of HIV replication did not affect IL-3-induced monocyte proliferation and IL-3 did not interfere with the anti-retroviral activity of AZT. Gallicchio (1992a) reported the results of studies designed to evaluate in vitro the capacity of IL-3, in dose-escalation fashion, to modulate AZT toxicity on normal human marrow derived granulocyte /erythroid/macrophage/megakaryocyte Colony formation for each progenitor was increased in the presence of IL-3 compared to cultures plated in its absence. In the presence of AZT (IDso dose, used for each progenitor), IL-3 reduced AZT toxicity, with the most significant response observed for CFU-GEMM, indicating IL-3 may exert an effect on early, less differentiated haematopoietic progenitors. A-Z OF TREATMENTS 163 [Page 164](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/170?q1=directories) However, Gallicchio's research with AZT-treated mice of IL-3 exacerbated AZT-related anaemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia and that mice receiving IL-3 alone or in combination with EPO developed toxicity earlier than mice receiving only EPO. The manufacturer reports that in a study of IL-3 (250 pg/m2 and 500 pg/m ) administered daily for 15 days to nine patients with myeloplastic syndrome and prolonged cytopenia, increases in total leukocytes, basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes were observed.

It is associated with a TH2, or humoral immune response involving antibodies, rather than a cellular (TH1I) immune response. Interleukin-4 also triggers HIV replication in monocytes and macrophages. For this reason, interleukin-4 should probably only be used in combination with antiretroviral drugs such as AZT. Schering-Plough manufactures a form of interleukin-4 produced artificially by genetic engineering. Current use Interleukin-4 is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Research into its effects in people with HIV is still in very early stages. A pilot study reported that it may result in partial improvements in people with advanced Kaposis sarcoma and it is now being tested as a treatment for people with less advanced KS. Preliminary results from a phase I study (ACTG 224) found that it had unexpected and substantial anti-HIV effects as measured by its effect on p24 antigen levels. The drug is administered by subcutaneous injection. Side-effects seen in phase I studies have included headache, fatigue, fever and oedema. Key research Novak and Kazazi reported that IL-4 was a potent inducer of HIV expression in monocytes and macrophages. According to the manufacturer, IL-4 stimulates lymphocyte function, including B and T cells. It appears to enhance neutrophil and monocyte function and increase generation of antigen-specific cell-killing T-cells Miles has enrolled 11 people with KS in ACTG 224, a phase 1/11 dose-escalating study of interleukin-4. At 0.5 rpg/kg/day, 4 participants had progression, 2 voluntarily discontinued and 1 had stable disease. At 1.5 pg/kg/day, 2 participants had progression, 1 voluntarily discontinued and 1 had stable disease. Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and grade 3 hypotension were observed at the latter dose level. Side-effects are mild headaches, fatigue and fevers. No significant effect on CD4 count has been observed, but baseline CD4 percentage was only 1.2%. Significant decreases in p24 antigenaemia (median 60% decrease at 4 weeks) occurred in all 9 antigenaemic participants. References Kazazi F et al.

In test-tube experiments conducted in late 1993, researchers at the US National Cancer Institute reported that interleukin-12 improved the response of the cellular immune system to foreign organisms. In people with HIV, cellular immune responses are often diminished or lost entirely. Artificial (recombinant) interleukin-12 is manufactured by the Genetics Institute Inc. in the USA. Current use Interleukin-12 is an unlicensed, experimental drug. It has never been taken by humans. Clinical trials in people with HIV are expected to begin during 1994 or 1995. Trial results IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine encoded by two separate genes, p40 and p35. It is naturally produced by macrophages and B lymphocytes in response to antigenic stimulation. Scott reported that it stimulates the production of gamma interferon from T and natural killer (NK) cells. Seder reported that IL-12 enhances production of gamma interferon and reduces IL-4 mediated suppression of gamma interferon. Gazzinelli found that it is required for T-cell-independent triggering of NK cells by intracellular parasites such as T. gondii. It has been proposed as a treatment for HIV disease because it stimulates the TH1 subset of CD4 cells which may be important for preventing disease progression in HIV-infected people. In one model, Hsieh demonstrated that IL-12 induced TH1 development in naive CD4+ T-cells undergoing primary activation. Chehimi reported that levels of interleukin-12 in HIV-infected people are significantly lower than those seen in uninfected age-matched controls. Clerici reported that IL-1 2 augments the in vitro production of cytokines associated with TH1 responses (IL-2 and alpha interferon) in HIV-infected individuals. PBMCs were cultured from 40 HIV-positive individuals unable to produce IL-2 in response to envelope peptides of HIV-1. When these cells were Env-stimulated in the presence of IL-1 2, increased IL-2 production was observed in 28/40 (70%). Env-stimulated IL-2 production was not seen in PBMCs from nine HIV-negative individuals studied as a control. PHA-stimulated gamma interferon production was diminished in 8 HIV-positive people; IL-12 incubation augmented gamma interferon production in 6/8 individuals. Finally, PBMCs from HIV-positive people were stimulated in vitro with non-HIV antigens (influenza virus and HLA-disparate PBMCs); IL-12 increased the T helper cell response to these antigens. Elevated responses to these antigens were not observed in cells from HIV-negative people. McLeod reported that in vitro IL-12 has neither a direct inhibitory nor stimulatory effect on HIV replication. References Chehimi J et al.

In most children and some adults with HIV infection, immunoglobulins (antibodies) are not secreted normally. This means that the individual can be vulnerable to bacterial infections. Intravenous immunoglobulin consists of the antibodies extracted from pooled blood donations from hundreds or thousands of donors. By pooling the antibodies from so many people, the preparation is likely to include a broad range of antibodies against many different pathogens. It is also possible to obtain specific immunoglobulin preparations, which contain only antibodies against a specific pathogen such as CMV. This therapy is different from passive immunotherapy where plasma with high levels of specifically anti-HIV antibodies is given. Intravenous immunoglobulin is marketed tradenames Endobulin, Gamimune-N, Venoglobulin and Vigam. It is sometimes abbreviated to IVIG, or referred to as gamma globulin. Current use Studies in HIV-positive children confirm that treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin can help to prevent bacterial infections - but only in children who are not receiving co-trimoxazole. For children who are receiving co-trimoxazole, IVIG does not appear to offer any added protection against bacterial infections or to prolong survival. Studies in adults have shown no evidence of beneficial effects on immunological markers or CD4 count. One study suggested that it may be an effective treatment for HIV-related thrombocytopenia, and it is the standard treatment for B19 parvovirus infection. Despite its name, the drug can be given either by the intravenous or the intramuscular injection route. Side-effects to immunoglobulin are rare but may include flushing of the face, chest tightness, chills and fever. Getting it Intravenous immunoglobulin is a licensed treatment for people with low antibody levels, for idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura and for preventing infections in people who have received blood transfusions. In March 1994 it was licensed as a treatment for HIV-positive children. Its use as an anti-HIV treatment in adults is experimental and unlicensed. Current developments Trials are underway employing HIVIG (hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin), which consists of antibodies to HIV, to establish whether it can reduce the rate of HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children before or during birth. Research The National Institute of Child Health and Development in the USA enrolled 372 symptomatic HIV-positive children in a double-blind placebo-controlled study of IVIG (400 mg/kg once a month) as prophylaxis for serious bacterial infections. Equal numbers of patients in each group also received AZT (39% overall) and PCP prophylaxis (48% overall). Patients were stratified according to entry CD4 count. Median follow-up was 17 months. The study was terminated after an interim analysis showed that among the 317 children who entered the study with CD4 cell counts above 200, IVIG significantly reduced the number of laboratory-proven bacterial infections (meningitis, bacteraemia, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, acute sinusitis, pneumonia, acute mastoiditis, or abscess of an internal organ). Among children in this group, 12/162 (7%) IVIG recipients experienced a lab-proven serious bacterial infection, compared to 24/155 (15%) placebo recipients. For children with entry CD4 counts below 200, there was no difference in the rate of these infections. Mortality rates were equal between the IVIG and placebo groups, with 31 deaths in each. Mofenson (1992) reported that at all ages, HIV-infected children in this study had significantly lower CD4 counts than published age-equivalent norms for uninfected children. Regression slope analysis demonstrated that while both IVIG and placebo arms had a decline in CD4 count over time, for children with entry CD4 counts of at least 200 the rate of decline in the placebo arm was 33 cells/month versus 18 cells/month in the IVIG arm. There was no significant difference in CD4 slopes between IVIG and placebo in children with entry CD4 counts below 200. Mofenson (1993) reported that after placebo recipients were crossed-over to receive IVIG, their rate of serious bacterial infections declined significantly to a level comparable with those originally assigned to IVIG. Spector enrolled 255 children aged between 3 months and 12 years who had AIDS or ARC in ACTG 051, a double-blind study of intravenous immunoglobulin (400 mg/kg every 28 days) or placebo. All participants also received AZT (180 mg/m four times daily). After a median follow-up of 30.6 months, the estimated two-year rates of seriosu bacterial infections with confirmed pathogens was significantly lower in the immune globulin group (16.9% versus 24.3%). However, the treatment effect was mainly seen in 174 children who were not receiving co-trimoxazole prophylaxis at entry; in this subgroup, 11.6% of immune globulin recipients developed bacterial infections versus 26.8% of the placebo group. In co-trimoxazole recipients, no significant difference in the rate of bacterial infections between immune globulin and placebo recipients was observed. No difference in two-year survival rates was seen (79.2% among immune globulin recipients and 75.4% in the placebo arm). Kiehl enrolled 148 people with ARC or AIDS in a study comparing IVIG (0.4 g/kg initially, followed by 2 g/kg every 3 weeks) and placebo. IVIG significantly reduced the occurrence of diarrhoea and among people with AIDS, those taking IVIG required significantly fewer hospitalisations. 8 out of 23 deaths in the control group were due to bacterial infection, compared with only 1 out of 16 deaths among the treated patients. Wagner enrolled 36 asymptomatic haemophiliacs (age 6-19 years) in a prospective controlled open trial of IVIG (0.3 g/kg at two week intervals). After 24 months of evaluation 7/18 treated participants and 5/18 controls deteriorated according to their staging, with one in each group developing AIDS. Thrombocytopenia and infectious events, but no severe bacterial infections, occurred in both groups in similar numbers. The absolute CD4 T cell count decreased by a mean of 284 in the IVIG group and by 143 in the control group respectively. The statistical analysis of these criteria did not reveal any significant difference. Krueger conducted a randomized double-blind longitudinal study of IVIG with 30 HIV-positive adults with ARC or Walter Reed stage 5 disease. Although the IVIG-treated patients showed an improvement of their clinical score, no significant changes were observed in lymphocyte phenotypes, activation markers, immunoglobulins and subclasses, lymphocyte turnover or in indicators of acute inflammation. HIV antigen expression in blood lymphocytes remained uninfluenced by IVIG. Mars treated 35 HIV-positive adults with antiretroviral treatments plus intravenous immunoglobulin (1 g/kg every month) and compared each with an untreated matched control. Treated people experienced a significantly higher rate of improvement in Karnofsky scores and in recurrent infections, but also experienced significantly more opportunistic infections. Rarick treated 14 adults with HIV-related immune thrombocytopenia with IVIG (1 g/kg on days 1 and 2 and 1 g/kg on day 15). The median platelet count at baseline was 17,000. All patients had a transient response by day eight. The median maximum platelet count achieved was 220,000. The median platelet count declined to 40,000 at day 15. The investigators suggested that IVIG be used in patients with HIV-related thrombocytopenia who required an immediate increase in platelet count. References Kiehl M et al.

During an acute infection, iron is removed from the blood and stored in the liver. There is some evidence that this response prevents the growth of bacteria, since high levels of iron seem to stimulate the growth of bacteria. On the other hand, iron deficiency causes a fall in T-cell numbers, reducing immunity to infection. Unless there is clear iron deficiency anaemia (not AZT-related anaemia) there is no good reason to supplement iron. Good food sources of iron are meat (especially liver), poultry and fish. * Iscador Iscador is the tradename for an extract of mistletoe pruced by the Hiscia Institute in Switzerland. In test-tube studies it has been shown to improve the ability of phagocytes to engulf foreign organisms and to increase natural killer (NK) cell activity and CD8 cell activity against foreign organisms or infected cells that have been 'tagged' by antibodies. Current use Iscador is an unlicensed, experimental drug. It has also been used experimentally for the treatment of cancer. A phase I study in people with HIV suggested that it may have immune modulating and/or antiviral effects which merit further study. Iscador is give by injection. Some people have reported painful swelling at the injection site and slight fever. Key research Gorter enrolled 40 people with HIV with CD4 counts above 200 in a phase 1/11 dose-escalating study of Iscador (0.01 - 10 mg injected subcutaneously twice a week for 18 weeks). The only side-effects were reddening at the site of injection and a slight increase in body temperature on the day of injection. 28/36 had a CD4 count increase of at least 20% after week 12, average levels of beta2-microglobulin fell and 2/8 p24 antigenaemic participants became antigen negative. References Gorter R et al. Immune modulating and anti-HIV activities of Viscum album (Iscador). 9th Intl * ISIS 2922 Isis 2922 is an experimental treatment produced using antisense technology. Technically it is known as an antisense oligonucleotide. When CMV infects a cell, it incorporates part of its genetic material (called the proviral DNA) into the genetic material (or DNA) of the human cell. When the CMV-infected cell reproduces, the proviral DNA is converted into messenger RNA (mRNA) and travels out from the cell nucleus to make the proteins from which new virus particles are made. The antisense drug is a molecule which has been carefully designed so that it binds tightly onto part of the mRNA. This means that when the infected cell reproduces, the antisense drug prevents the production of the proteins from which new virus particles would be made and so prevents the infection of other cells. A phase 1/11 study in 16 people who had failed to respond to standard therapies found that the drug controlled CMV retinitis for 4-26 weeks. It is injected into the eye (intravitreal administration), and can cause eye inflammation as a side-effect. * Isoniazid Isoniazid is an approved antibiotic which, in combination with other drugs, is the standard treatment for tuberculosis. In the USA it is also commonly used as tuberculosis prophylaxis, although this is not common in the UK. Isoniazid comes as tablets, an elixir to be drunk or a liquid for intravenous injection. Its side-effects can include rash, fever, jaundice, peripheral neuritis (nerve inflammation) and hepatitis. The risk of liver problems may be less than commonly believed; a literature search of published data and a survey sent to TB officers across the USA found that isoniazid was very safe especially when monitoring guidelines are followed, with no increase in the rate of fatal liver toxicity above that seen in the general population. Chambers reported that ddC decreases levels of isoniazid in the blood. Isoniazid is available as a generic (non-brandname) product. It is sometimes abbreviated to INH. References Chambers J et al.

It is also known as inosine pranobex or by the tradename Methisoprinol. Current use Early laboratory studies of isoprinosine were conducted in cells that were not infected with HIV. Tests in HIV-infected cell lines in vitro have found conflicting evidence as to whether isoprinosine has a direct anti-HIV effect. One large placebo-controlled study of isoprinosine found no evidence that it delayed disease progression or affected immunological or virological markers. Another study suggested that treatment did delay progression from asymptomatic infection to AIDS, but found no effect on progression to non-AIDS symptomatic disease or on markers such as p24 antigen levels or CD4 count. Isoprinosine is remarkably free of side-effects and has been a popular drug in the treatment 'underground' in the USA. Use in combinations Isoprinosine has been used safely in combination with AZT, although there is no evidence that this affects the efficacy of AZT. A study of isoprinosine in combination with ribavirin found no evidence of beneficial immunological or virological effects, but participants experienced a generalised loss of white blood cells, including CD4 cells, which partially recovered 1 month after the drugs were discontinued. Getting it Isoprinosine comes as a crystalline powder which can be partly dissolved in water. It is available from buyers' clubs in the USA. A study comparing isoprinosine to another immune modulator, oxpentifylline, is ongoing in London. Key research Pompidou reported that isoprinosine (200 pg/ml) reduced HIV reverse transcriptase activity in PBL by 48%. However, Hansen reported that in vitro isoprinosine did not inhibit HIV infection at any concentration. Isoprinosine had no effect on the production of infectious virus and did not inhibit syncytia formation in chronically infected H9 cells. Hansen concluded that isoprinosine has no direct effect on HIV in vitro. Two major double-blind placebo-controlled trials of isoprinosine in HIV-infected subjects have yielded conflicting results. 696 HIV-positive asymptomatic/early ARC people with CD4 counts between 200 400/mm3 were enrolled in a multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled USA/UK trial. Patients received isoprinosine 4 g/day by mouth or placebo for 6 months, then all patients received isoprinosine for 6 months. Sztein reported that after 6 months, no effects on virological or immunological markers were seen among the 79 participants at one centre. At another centre Phair also saw no significant immunological or clinical effects. The manufacturer reported that overall, isoprinosine had no effect on disease progression as compared to placebo. Pedersen enrolled 866 HIV-positive asymptomatic/early ARC individuals in a multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled isoprinosine trial in Denmark and Sweden. Patients were randomised to receive isoprinosine 3 g/day by mouth for 6 months or placebo. Of the 833 evaluable subjects, 2/412 (0.5%) isoprinosine-treated patients progressed to AIDS as compared to 17/421 (4%) placebo recipients. However, no difference in progression to symptomatic disease besides AIDS was observed and no difference in the decrease in CD4 count or p24 antigenaemia level was detected. In an accompanying editorial, Kweder suggested that a confirmatory trial be conducted before claims of efficacy for isoprinosine are accepted. Thorsen reported that 596 participants in the above study continued on open treatment. All patients were evaluated with regard to progression to AIDS and/or death. Within 48 weeks, 10/412 (2.4%) patients assigned isoprinosine and 27/420 (6.4%) patients assigned placebo progressed to AIDS. Intention-to-treat analysis showed identical results. Viewing the open treatment phase in isolation revealed no difference in progression rates between those treated and those not receiving the drug, perhaps reflecting the higher proportion of patients receiving zidovudine or PCP prophylaxis in the latter group. No severe adverse reactions or toxicities were observed. Teglbjaerg analysed samples from 642 people who received isoprinosine and 334 who received placebo in the Scandinavian multicentre placebo-controlled isoprinosine study, comparing HIV-antigen levels before and during treatment. During the study 17 placebo recipients progressed to AIDS, compared with 2 treated with isoprinosine. The proportion of HIV-antigen-positive patients who developed AIDS during treatment was significantly higher than the proportion of HIV-antigen-negative patients in whom AIDS developed (6% vs 2%). No significant changes in HIV-antigen levels were observed between the isoprinosine and the placebo-treated group of HIV-antigen-positive patients. Median HIV-antigen levels did not change significantly in either the isoprinosine or the placebo-treated group. The researchers conclude that the lack of effect of isoprinosine on HIV antigen indicates that any beneficial effect of the drug is not the result of a direct antiviral activity against HIV. De Simone enrolled 553 people with HIV in a randomised, multicentre trial of isoprinosine (two 500 mg tablets every 6 hours for 3 months) versus no treatment. Isoprinosine was associated with a slightly improved clinical condition or with a trend in that direction, as compared to the untreated group. Treated participants also experienced a preservation of the CD4/CD8 cell ratio values, a decrease in the CD8 cells and an increase in the Leu 2-7+ cell number better than in the untreated individuals. No serious or adverse effects were observed. Pedersen treated 8 HIV-positive, healthy patients with isoprinosine (3 g/day for 28 days); six patients received no treatment but were examined in parallel and two patients were withdrawn. Isoprinosine significantly enhanced the lymphoproliferative response after stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and purified derivative of tuberculin (PPD), while isoprinosine had no effect on the following immune parameters: the expression of surface markers on blood not influence the ability of IL-2 to stimulate the proliferation of lymphocytes or the natural killer (NK) cell activity either unstimulated or stimulated in vitro with alpha interferon. IL-2, or indomethacin. Neither did isoprinosine affect the in vitro production of IL-1 alpha or beta, IL-2, IL-6, or tumour necrosis factor. Grieco administered isoprinosine (4 g/day) to 5 people with AIDS and 4 with ARC. There was no significant association of isoprinosine treatment and CD4/CD8 ratio alterations in either group. In addition, there was no significant enhancement of lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogens in 5 people with AIDS. However, the mean lymphocyte proliferative responses to phytohmaglutinin and concanavalin A in patients with ARC increased after 28 days of treatment. Schulof evaluated the clinical, immunologic and virologic effects of oral treatment with ribavirin and isoprinosine for up to 3 months in asymptomatic, HIV-culture-positive gay men. 15 men received isoprinosine 4 g/day and 800 mg/day (9 men) or 1200 mg/day (6 men) of ribavirin. Five men in each ribavirin dosage group completed at least 2 months of treatment. No unexpected toxicities were observed. Eight minor HIV-related events occurred in six men while on study. All men remained HIV-positive and time to positive culture decreased by at least 4 days in three men from each treatment group. Serum p24 levels did not change in two men who were p24 antigenaemic and received 800 mg/day of ribavirin. Treatment was associated with a generalized lymphopenia affecting all lymphocyte subsets including CD4, which was partially reversible 1 month after stopping treatment. Most of the men remained anergic on DTHS skin testing. No improvements were noted in in vitro lymphoproliferative responses to antigens or in NK cell activity (which decreased significantly in the 1,200 mg/day ribavirin group). Although well tolerated at the doses employed, the combination of ribavirin and isoprinosine produced an unexpected generalized lymphopenia and did not exhibit HIV-suppressive or immunorestorative effects.

It works primarily by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a main component in the fungal cell membrane. By depleting ergosterol it makes the cell membrane more fluid, reducing the activity of fungal enzymes and inhibitiing cell growth and replication. It is closely related to ketoconazole, and less closely to fluconazole. Itraconazole is manufactured by Janssen under the tradename Sporanox. Current use Among people with HIV its usual use is as treatment for candidiasis in the mouth or throat, or as maintenance therapy to prevent relapses. It is useful in mild-to-moderate cases of cryptococcal meningitis, both as a treatment and as maintenance therapy. It is also being tested as a treatment for aspergillosis; it appears to more active against the Aspergillus organisms than the other -azole antifungals. It is also effective against blastomycosis, histoplasmosis and non-meningeal coccidioidomycosis, and has been reported to be beneficial an a few cases of microsporidiosis affecting the eye. Itraconazole solution is supplied on a named patient basis for treating Candida or disseminated fungal infections in people for whom licensed antifungals are ineffective. Taking it Itraconazole comes in pink and blue capsules which enclose coated beads. A solution formulation of itraconazole is currently being tested in clinical trials. Absorption of itraconazole by people with AIDS appears to be reduced by approximately 50% compared with non-immunosuppressed people. It requires the stomach to be acidic for it to be properly absorbed, so it should not be taken at the same time as antacids or drugs that include an antacid such as ddl. Two to three times as much drug is absorbed when it is taken with food compared with when taken on an empty stomach. Side-effects Dose-related gastro-intestinal side-effects are the commonest problems but these rarely require treatment to be stopped in people taking doses up to 400 mg/day. Itraconazole can also rarely cause clinically important, even fatal hepatitis; it is therefore important that liver functions are regularly monitored. Other side-effects may include nausea and vomiting (in less than 10% of recipients), headache, dizziness, itching, rash, reduced blood levels of calcium (hypokalaemia), high blood pressure (hypertension), accumulation of fluid in tissues (oedema) and, rarely, impotence. Drug interactions Itraconazole must not be taken at the same time as the antihistamine drugs astemizole or terfenadine as these combinations have been associated with heart irregularities. These antihistamines are marketed under the brandnames Hismanal, Seldane and Terfex. Blood levels of itraconzole may be reduced if it is taken at the same time as antacids, histamine antagonists (ulcer treatments) or the anti-mycobacterial drugs isoniazid or rifampin. Taking itraconazole can increase blood levels of cyclosporin, digoxin (a drug used to increase the strength of the heart muscle contractions in people with heart failure), the anti-convulsant phenytoin, sulphonylurea drugs used for treating diabetes (especially tolbutamide) and the anti-coagulant warfarin that may be prescribed to people with heart disease.

It works primarily by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a main component in the fungal cell membrane. By depleting ergosterol it makes the cell membrane more fluid, reducing the activity of fungal enzymes and inhibitiing cell growth and replication. It is closely related to itaconazole, and less closely to fluconazole. Ketoconazole is manufactured by Janssen under the tradename Nizoral. Current use Among people with HIV its usual use is to treat candidiasis as an alternative to fluconazole and as maintenance therapy to prevent relapses of candidiasis. It is also used to treat blastomycosis and non-meningeal coccidioidomycosis, and to prevent relapses. It is not an effective treatment for fungal infections of the central nervous system such as cryptococcal meningitis. Taking it Ketoconazole comes as tablets or as a pink suspension. It requires the stomach to be acid for it to be properly absorbed, so it should not be taken at the same time as antacids or drugs that include an antacid such as ddl. 168 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 169](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/175?q1=directories) Side-effects Dose-related gastro-intestinal side-effects are the commonest problems but these rarely require treatment to be stopped in people taking doses up to 400 mg/day. Ketoconazole can also rarely cause clinically important, even fatal hepatitis; it is therefore important that liver functions are regularly monitored. Other side-effects may include nausea and vomiting (in less than 10% of recipients), abdominal pain, loss of appetite, rash, itching, adrenal insufficiency, decreased libido, impotence, gynecomastia, menstrual abnormalities, headache, fever and chills and photophobia (discomfort in bright light). Ketoconazole has been reported to reduce levels of serum testosterone, and low levels of testosterone may be one of the factors associated with wasting in AIDS. Drug interactions Ketoconazole must not be taken at the same time as the antihistamine drugs astemizole or terfenadine as these combinations have been associated with heart irregularities. These antihistamines are marketed under the brandnames Hismanal, Seldane and Terfex. Blood levels of ketoconzole may be reduced if it is taken at the same time as antacids, histamine antagonists (ulcer treatments) or the anti-mycobacterial drugs isoniazid or rifampin. Taking ketoconazole can increase blood levels of cyclosporin, the anti-convulsant phenytoin, sulphonylurea drugs used for treating diabetes (especially tolbutamide) and the anti-coagulant warfarin that may be prescribed to people with heart disease.

KNI-272 is the codename for a protease inhibitor being developed by Kyoto Pharmaceutical University in collaboration with Nippon Mining. It is currently in Phase 1/11 trials. m L-697,661 L-697,661 is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor the family of anti-HIV drugs to which nevirapine and TIBOL also belong. These drugs act by inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme, but in a different way from the nucleoside analogue drugs like AZT, ddC and ddl. L-697,661 is also known as pyridinone. Current use Early trials showed that, although L-697,661 has anti-HIV activity in the body, HIV rapidly becomes resistant to the drug. Its manufacturer, Merck, stopped trials of L-697,661 on its own and instead concentrated on studying it in combination with AZT, in the hope that resistance would be delayed and effectiveness increased. However, even in combinations resistance developed rapidly and Merck has decided to discontinue the development of the drug. A related drug, L-696,229 is still being studied. The side-effects reported with L-697,661 included headaches and moderate liver abnormalities. Use in combinations Promising in vitro results were reported with the convergent combination of AZT, ddl and L-697,661. It was thought that this combination of drugs caused mutations in HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme which totally prevented viral replication or the infection of new cells. However, this research was subsequently shown to be flawed. Current developments Goldman reported that a new 'L-drug' called L-696,229 also has antiviral and reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity and is undergoing preliminary testing. Its inhibition of RT was concentration dependent and specific. L-696,229 prevented the spread of HIV-1 infection in culture. No resistance was observed. L-696,229 can also reach higher concentrations in the blood, because it binds less to plasma proteins. Key research Saag reported on 135 participants (68 with CD4 counts between 200-500, 67 with CD4 counts below 200) enrolled in separate 6-week double-blind trials. Participants received either AZT 500 mg/day, placebo or L-697,661 (either 25 mg twice a day, 100 mg three times daily or 500 mg twice a day). 80-85% had over 3 months prior use of AZT. After completing 12 weeks on study, subjects receiving either AZT or placebo were to be re-randomised to one of the three 'L-drug' arms. Transient CD4 count increases were observed among participants with CD4 counts below 200 in the two groups receiving higher doses of L-697,661, but not in those receiving the lower dose or AZT. L-697,661 led to rapid, dose-related decreases in plasma p24 antigen levels; however, in some patients this fell below baseline by 6 weeks, coinciding with the emergence of resistant viruses. This change in susceptibility was more frequent among patients receiving the higher doses of L-697,661. Davey reported that among a subset of participants in this study, mean logarithmic reciprocal titres of plasma virus in patients taking either L-697,661 or AZT decreased by week 4 of therapy; for L-697,661 recipients these changes were dose-dependent and, at the highest dose tested, were comparable in magnitude to those seen with AZT. Viral suppression induced by L-697,661 persisted through 8 weeks of treatment but decreased by week 12. This rebound paralleled emergence of L-697,661 -resistant viral isolates. Sardana reported that resistance to L-697,661 is associated with amino acid substitutions at positions 103, 181 and 108 in the reverse transcriptase enzyme. This mutation results in cross-resistance with most other drugs of the same class (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) such as nevirapine, BHAP compounds and the TIBO/TIBOL compounds, even though it has never been exposed to them. It is not known if resistant virus will revert to being sensitive after a period of time when the drug is removed. Staszewski treated 120 people with CD4 counts of 200-500 with either AZT alone, L-697,661 (300 mg/day) plus AZT, L-697,661 (600 mg/day) plus AZT, or L-697,661 (600 mg/day) alone. Low-level resistance (greater than 2 fold) was observed in all groups by week 16. However, high-level resistance (greater than 25 fold) was only observed in the L-697,661 monotherapy arm. Switching from L-697,661 monotherapy to combination treatment with L-697,661 plus AZT reversed the development of high-level resistance to L-697,661. Massari enrolled 93 people with CD4 counts below 250 in a trial comparing L-697,661 (400 mg/day) plus AZT (600 mg/day) with AZT monotherapy. No serious adverse events were attributable to L-697,661. Decreases in p24 antigen and viral RNA were transient and returned to baseline levels or higher by 8-12 weeks. The combination arm did not prevent the emergence of HIV strains resistant to L-697 in all 22 people tested. Consequently Merck decided to abandon development of L-697,661. Chow (1 993a) suggested that three-drug combinations including a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, AZT, and ddl could completely suppress viral replication in vitro. However, Larder subsequently A-Z OF TREATMENTS 169 [Page 170](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/176?q1=directories) reported that viable multi-drug resistant HIV-1 is selected in vitro, and Chow (1993b) has reported that the original results were in error.

SL-735,524 L-735,524 is a protease inhibitor - the family of anti-HIV drugs to which saquinavir also belongs. These drugs act by inhibiting HIV's protease enzyme. Protease (or proteinase) is the name of the enzyme that HIV uses when it replicates within a cell to break up large viral proteins into smaller ones from which new virus particles can be made. Protease inhibitors have been shown to slow down the replication of HIV in the test-tube. Because HIV protease is only created by infected cells and has no normal function in the body, drugs that act specifically against it are unlikely to harm normal cells. Current use L-735,524 is an unlicensed, experimental drug. An 8-person trial found that the drug caused dramatic reduction in levels of HIV, but that these returned to normal levels after 6 months, suggesting that HIV had developed resistance to the drug. Phase II trials are continuing, but none is taking place in the UK. It is being tested both alone and in combination with AZT, and a trial testing it in combination with both AZT and ddl is being planned. Key research Teppler reported on the pharmacokinetics of L-735,524 in studies involving 48 HIV-negative and 24 HIV-positive individuals. IC95 in cell culture was less than 100 nM. It exhibited good oral bioavailability and plasma pharmacokinetic profiles and doses of up to 400 mg four times daily were generally well tolerated. Tha manufacturer reported that 4 participants received 600 mg four times daily at which dose-limiting toxicities (elevations in liver enzymes and bilirubin) were observed. Deutsch reported on the antiviral activity on L-735,524 among 22 HIV-positive p24-antigenaemic participants in phase I studies. The only clearly drug-related side-effect was a reversible increase in bilirubin without other abnormalities in liver function. In an initial study, at a dose of 400 mg every 6 hours for 12 days, serum p24 values declined by 70% and the median increase in CD4 count was 77. In a second small ongoing trial, 4 participants are receiving L-735,524 at a dose of 400 - 600 mg every 6 hours. After 4 weeks, serum HIV RNA and p24 declined by 1 to 3 log i in all four participants. However by week 16 viral RNA levels had returned to or near starting levels in all four, while by contrast serum p24 has remained at or near undetectable levels in all four. The discrepancy between serum p24 and RNA is possibly due to the induction of interfering anti-p24 antibodies. Viral isolates from 2/4 exhibited low-level decreased sensitivity to L-735,524 in cell culture. Median increases in CD4 count were 56 after 2 weeks, 136 after 16 weeks and 87 after 20 weeks. The four participants had increases in subnormal levels of platelets, neutrophils and haemoglobin which largely persisted through week 20. 3/4 had sustained weight gain with increases of 16-20 Ibs at week 20. A third activity trial is in progress, investigating the effects of 600 mg every 8 hours. Initial signs of antiviral activity, CD4 change and correction of blood abnormalities are similar to previous trials. 60 people with CD4 counts below 500 were enrolled in a phase II double-blind study comparing AZT (600 mg/day) to L-735,524 (200 or 400 mg four times daily) for 12 weeks. Increases in CD4 and decreases in plasma viral RNA levels and p24 were observed. After 24 weeks, patients were allowed to enroll in a long-term open-label extension study. Meanwhile, increased RNA levels were noted in 4 participants receiving L-735,524 at 400 mg four times daily for more than 12 weeks in an open-label extension of an earlier protocol. Due to these observations, all patients who had been randomized to L-735,524 now receive a dose of 600 mg four times daily. References Deutsch P et al.

Pharmacokinetics and tolerability studies of L-735,524, a new HIV protease 1st Natl Conf on Human Retroviruses, Washington, * Lamivudine Like AZT, ddl and ddC, lamivudine is a modified form of one of the building blocks of DNA (known as nucleosides). When HIV replicates in the presence of these nucleoside analogue drugs, the virus' reverse transcriptase enzyme incorporates the drug in the place of a normal nucleoside in the growing DNA strand. This prevents the proper assembly of viral genetic material and halts viral replication. Lamivudine is also being tested as a treatment for hepatitis B. Lamivudine was discovered by BioChem Pharma and has been developed by Glaxo. A deal struck in early 1994 has given marketing rights to lamivudine as an AIDS therapy to the Wellcome Foundation, manufacturers of AZT. Lamivudine is also known as 3TC. Current use Lamivudine is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Trials testing its effects on its own and in combination with AZT are in progress. Early laboratory research has suggested that it may have more anti-HIV activity than AZT and preliminary tests in people suggest that it may be less toxic than other nucleoside analogues. Research has shown that unlike AZT, lamivudine does not damage bone marrow cells. Its half-life is 10-15 hours, indicating that it may be only be necessary to take doses twice a day. 170 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 171](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/177?q1=directories) Trial results to date among people with asymptomatic HIV infection or AIDS have found evidence of antiviral effects in virological tests and short term increases in CD4 count have also been seen. To date there is no information about lamivudines effects on symptoms or survival. No major side-effects have been seen, although lamivudine may cause neutropenia, headache, fatigue, diarrhoea, rash, insomnia and peripheral neuropathy. As with other nucleoside analogues, it has been shown that HIV can mutate and develop resistance to the effects of lamivudine. Use in combinations Although lamivudine's own antiviral activity appears to be modest, it may be an attractive drug for use in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. It is the least toxic of the nucleoside analogue drugs. Moreover, treatment with lamivudine may cause AZT-resistant strains of HIV to regain sensitivity to AZT. Getting it Trials of lamivudine are currently taking place in Britain. The drug can also be obtained from Glaxo for use on a named patient basis for people who are intolerant of other anti-retroviral therapies and ineligible for or unable to take part in current clinical trials. Current developments Lamivudine is being tested in conjunction with other anti-HIV drugs in laboratory tests designed to find the most effective combination of drugs to test in large-scale clinical trials. Promising preliminary results have been seen with the triple combination of lamivudine, AZT and loviride. Key research (-)-2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) is the single (negative) enantiomer of the racemic mixture BCH-189. In preclinical studies lamivudine has been shown to be as effective as the racemate but with less potential for toxicity. Coates demonstrated the ability of lamivudine to suppress replication of HIV strains in T cell lines (mean ICso 4 nM-0.67 pM) and human peripheral blood lymphocytes (mean ICso 2.5-90 nM). Pluda reported the results of a dose-escalating study in 97 people with AIDS or advanced ARC with CD4 counts less than 300. There were no adverse events definitely ascribed to lamivudine. No CD4 response was seen at doses of 0.5 - 2 mg/kg/day or at 20 mg/kg/day. An unsustained early increase in CD4 count was seen in participants receiving 4, 8 or 12 mg/kg/day. Participants' weight was stable at 24 weeks at all dose levels. Danner and Van Leeuwen (1992) conducted a phase 1/11 dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary activity of lamivudine (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0 mg/kg/day) in (23%) or (77%) patients with CD4 counts below 400. 36% had prior AZT treatment. No major toxicities were observed; adverse events included intermittent headache, fatigue, diarrhoea, rash and one case of peripheral neuropathy, which were not dose-related. A mild, transient increase in CD4 counts sustained for up to 24 weeks was observed at all dose levels; drops in p24 and beta2-microglobulin sustained for up to 24 weeks and in neopterin sustained for up to 20 weeks were also seen. A sub-group of participants received 20 mg/kg/day; 6/15 developed grade 3 neutropenia. Boucher reported that a mutation at codon 184 resulted in HIV strains which are resistant to lamivudine. In a cohort of lamivudine-treated individuals, the appearance of this mutation preceded a rise in viral load. Tisdale reported that this mutation had no effect on susceptibility to AZT or nevirapine and minimal effect on susceptibility to ddl or ddC. Gao reported that one of the HIV reverse transcnptase mutations that results in low level resistance to ddl or ddC also confers a high level of resistance to lamivudine. Lewis conducted a phase 1/11 trial of 3TC (0.5, 1, 2, 4 or 6 mg/kg twice daily) in HIV-positive children. Little significant drug-related laboratory toxicity was identified and subjective improvement in energy levels and appetite were observed. van Leeuwen (1994) enrolled 30 people (median baseline CD4 count 113; 6 participants had AIDS) in a study of the addition of AZT (600 mg/day) after at least 24 weeks of lamivudine monotherapy (100 or 300 mg twice daily). An interim analysis found that the addition of AZT resulted in a modest increase in median CD4 count that fell below baseline by 52 weeks, and a sustained drop in p24 antigen levels. Plasma RNA load fell rapidly under 3TC monotherapy, rose gradually, fell again when AZT was added and then gradually rose again. No apparent differences between the lamivudine dose groups were observed. Staszewski presented an interim analysis of a pilot study comparing the triple combination of AZT (200 mg three times daily), lamivudine (300 mg twice daily) and loviride (100 mg three times daily) versus the double combination of AZT and loviride. No serious drug-induced safety abnormalities or clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. In the triple combination group median p24 antigen levels declined 69%, 80% and 68% below baseline at months 1, 2 and 3 respectively. For the double combination group the respective decreases in median p24 were 19%, 23% and 22%. A mutation conferring resistance to lamivudine was detected in some participants treated for 12 weeks with the triple combination. References Boucher C et al.

L-carnitine L-carnitine is an oral or intravenous formulation of a naturally occurring amino acid required for energy metabolism and found especially in muscle tissue. It is licensed in the USA under the tradename Carnitor for the treatment of people with carnitine deficiency. When the body doesn't get enough carnitine, fats are trapped in cells, and immune system cells may be less responsive to infections. Deficiency results in malfunctioning of the heart. Deficiency has been noted in people with AIDS, and one study in 20 men with advanced AIDS showed that patients given 6 grammes a day for two weeks showed marked reduction in serum triglycerides when compared with a placebo group, and their beta2 -microglobulin fell to almost normal levels. In the test tube carnitine is able to suppress the production of tumour necrosis factor, elevated levels of which are A-Z OF TREATMENTS 171 [Page 172](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/178?q1=directories) thought to be responsible for wasting in HIV-positive people. Researchers also found that those who received carnitine reported less fatigue and greater energy (De Simone). Oral L-carnitine (tablets or a solution) is being studied as a possible treatment for AZT-related muscle wasting. Side-effects include mild gastro-intestinal upsets. References De Simone C et al.

Letrazuril was recently withdrawn from development by its manufacturer, Janssen, after studies suggested that was not able to improve the symptoms of cryptosporidiosis. L-ofloxacin L-ofloxacin is an antibiotic which has a suggested action against reverse transcriptase. It is also being tested as a treatment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. It is closely related to oflaxacin, a drug approved for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases (N.gonorrhoea) and urinary tract infections, including NSU. It also known as levofloxacin or by the codename RWJ SLentinan 25213. Lentinan purified extract of the shiitake mushroom Lentinus edodes, which has been used in Japan as an anti-cancer drug. In the test-tube it appears to be an immune modulating drug that stimulates the function of T-helper cells and macrophages. Lentinan is manufactured by the Ajinomoto Co Inc in Tokyo and its American subsidiary Leonti-Chemico Pharmaceutical Laboratory Inc. Current use Two phase 1/11 trials in the USA found no evidence of any clinical or laboratory benefits from lentinan, although participants reported side-effects of allergic reactions, shivers and severe back and lumbar pains. Elevated liver function tests, rash and mild chest pressure have been reported in some cancer patients receiving lentinan. Key research Tochikura reported that in vitro lentinan had no anti-HIV effects but inhibited AZT's inhibition of viral replication in cell cultures. Abrams enrolled 44 HIV-positive people (CD4 cell counts between 200-500) in a phase 1/11 double-blind placebo-controlled trial at San Francisco General Hospital. In lentinan-treated people, no significant change was noted in CD4 count, beta2-microglobulin levels, neutrophil function activity, skin-test reactivity, or p24 antigen levels. Anaphylactic reaction, rigors and severe lumbar pain were reported. In a similar study conducted by the CRI in New York, preliminary reports do not suggest any improvement in subjective symptoms, virologic or immunologic parameters. References Abrams D et al.

However, there have also been reports that it can cause side-effects of gastro-intestinal disturbance, nausea, insomnia and headache have been seen. Key research Although the exact mechanism of anti-HIV activity is unknown, Gurtler has shown in vitro that some fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin) can inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase. Junko infected a selected CEM cell line with HIV-1 (LAV). Infection of the cell line resulted in complete cell death within 20 days post-exposure. L-ofloxacin (0.1-10 mg/ml) added to the medium protected the infected cells from HIV cytotoxic effects. Similar results were reported by Nozaki. References Gurtler L et al.

In test-tube studies, loviride inhibits HIV-1, but has no activity against HIV-2 or animal retroviruses such as FeLV or SIV. It is equally effective against AZT-sensitive and AZT-resistant strains of HIV-1. It is synergistic with AZT and ddC in vitro. Loviride belongs to the TIBOL class of drugs. TIBOL stands for 'TIBO-like compound'. TIBO is an abbreviated form of the chemical name tetrahydroimidazobenzodiazepine, a class of drugs similar to valium. These compounds are also known as alpha-anilino phenylacetamide (alpha-APA) derivatives. Other TIBO/TIBOL compounds that have been studied but are no longer being pursued are R 18893 and R 82913. Loviride was formerly known by the codename R 89439. These drugs are manufactured by Janssen. Current use Loviride is an unlicensed, experimental drug. A study comparing loviride, R 18893 and placebo in 114 asymptomatic people found that R 18893 was not significantly different from placebo, but loviride produced CD4 count increases which on average remained above baseline values throughout the 24 week study. The only side-effects from loviride were rashes and itching, and no resistant virus strains had developed after 6 months of treatment. In Phase I trials of loviride 10% of participants experienced diarrhoea. Use in combinations Trials studying loviride in combination are underway, including a study at the Kobler Centre in London. Promising preliminary results have been seen with the triple combination of loviride, AZT and lamivudine. Key research Pauwels found that in five cell systems, TIBO derivatives inhibited HIV-1 in nanomolar amounts which are 104-105 times lower than the cytotoxic concentration. By contrast, AZT, ddC and ddl inhibit both HIV-1 and HIV-2 at concentrations that, depending on the cell systems, are only 2 to 4 orders of magnitude below their cytotoxic concentration. Janssen reported the development of R 88703 and loviride, with good oral bioavailability and a high in vivo antiviral activity compared with R 18893. de Vreese reported that in vitro viral resistance to TIBO has been seen. This resistance is conferred by a single mutation (tyrosine181 - cysteine). Richman reported that this mutation also confers resistance to other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as nevirapine. De Brabander (1994) enrolled 1 14 people with CD4 counts above 400 in a study comparing loviride, R 18893 and placebo. After 6 months the loviride group demonstrated a more sustained rise in CD4 count compared with the placebo group and decreases in viral load as measured by HIV RNA PCR. No mutations leading to resistance to loviride were seen. Side-effects included itching and rash involving the elbows and hands. No significant differences between R 18893 and placebo were observed. Staszewski presented an interim analysis of a pilot study comparing the triple combination of AZT (200 mg three times daily), lamivudine (300 mg twice daily) and loviride (100 mg three times daily) versus the double combination of AZT and loviride. No serious drug-induced safety abnormalities or clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. In the triple combination group median p24 antigen levels declined 69%, 80% and 68% below baseline at months 1, 2 and 3 respectively. For the double combination group the respective decreases in median p24 were 19%, 23% and 22%. A mutation conferring resistance to lamivudine was detected in some participants treated for 12 weeks with the triple combination. References De Brabander M et al.

Researchers are investigating its possible usefulness as a treatment for mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis and MAI. The experimental treatment consists of an intradermal injection of killed M. vaccae organisms. It is thought to act as a form of therapeutic vaccine, stimulating a cellular (TH1) immune response against mycobacteria. Key research Stanford conducted a placebo-controlled study of M. vaccae immunotherapy as an adjunct to chemotherapy for pulmonary tuberculosis in Nigeria. Of 17 HIV-positive participants, 8 received the immunotherapy and nine the placebo after 1 week of antituberculosis therapy. Ten to 12 months later all 8 receiving the immunotherapy were alive, whereas only 3 placebo recipients.2/2 recipients of immunotherapy who were retested at follow-up were both found to have become seronegative for HIV-1, whereas those recipients of placebo who were retested remained seropositive at that time. There was no non-specific inhibition of antibody production, since other antibodies present in the sera of the two patients persisted at follow-up, including low levels of antinuclear antibody in one patient, and anti-smooth muscle antibody in the other. A more recent follow-up confirmed that all eight of the immunotherapy recipients are alive and 174 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 175](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/181?q1=directories) apparently well 2 years after entering the study, whereas at least eight of the nine receiving placebo have died.

Oxidative stress is a natural consequence of the use of nutrients by human cells. The molecules that make up cells contain pairs of electrons, one positive and one negative. These balanced pairs can be disrupted during the burning of energy in the cell, and positive electrons will begin to fly around, causing damage to the cell, including its genetic template, the DNA. Free radicals also damage the membrane of a cell, disrupting its absorption of nutrients and other functions essential to the health of a cell. Some bodily processes - like fighting infection - produce far greater quantities of free radicals than the body's anti-oxidant stores can cope with. Polluted air, water and food, cigarette smoke, recreational and treatment drugs are also potent sources of free radicals. Laboratory studies suggest that oxidative stress boosts HIV replication, and in turn, HIV replication boosts the production of free radicals, causing more oxidative stress. Sexually transmitted infections, repeated antibiotic use and poor nutrition also increase the likelihood of high levels of free radical activity. Free radicals have also been implicated in apoptosis or 'programmed cell death', a process in which instead of being activated by exposure to an antigen, T-cells first become anergic (literally, no energy) and then commit suicide. It is thought that this may be one cause of the loss of CD4 cells in people with HIV. NAC is believed to work primarily by increasing the level of glutathione in cells. Glutathione is necessary for life; it helps cells produce energy and it also helps protect them against oxidation. In addition, it may be an immunomodulator, necessary for T-cell activation. Test-tube studies suggest that NAC is able to prevent the stimulation of HIV activity by substances such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and PMA. TNF and IL-6 levels are abnormally high in people with HIV. Current use Few controlled trials in people with HIV have taken place. A study in Sweden enrolled 45 asymptomatic patients in a 4 month double-blind placebo-controlled study. There were no reported benefits. NAC is used extensively in the States by people with HIV who obtain it from buyers' clubs or in 'underground' community trials. A 14 week study of intravenous and oral NAC in 16 asymptomatic people found that the oral form of NAC was poorly absorbed and did not reach blood levels sufficient to inhibit HIV. No changes in CD4 count, p24 antigenaemia or plasma levels of HIV were seen. When used for its approved indications, NAC is considered to be a non-toxic treatment. Inflammation of the mouth (stomatitis), nausea, vomiting and fever have been reported infrequently. Getting it Aerosolised NAC is an approved treatment for bronchitis and it is administered systemically for the management of paracetamol poisoning. NAC is available in liquid form in the United States; it is available in liquid, powder and tablet form in Europe. Buyers clubs in the USA sell effervescent or capsule forms of NAC imported from Europe. NAC can also be purchased from many health food stores as a nutritional supplement. No trials of NAC are currently taking place in Britain. Key research Eck reported that glutathione levels are depressed in HIV-infected subjects; these findings were confirmed by Buhl at the NIH. Similar falls in glutathione occur in monkeys infected with SIV. Kalebic reported that in vitro NAC, glutathione and glutathione ester suppress the induction of viral expression in chronically HIV-infected monocytes. Mihm showed that in vitro cysteine or NAC raise intracellular glutathione levels and inhibit HIV-1 replication in persistently infected Molt-4 or U937 cells. Roederer reported that NAC inhibits HIV replication in vitro by raising intracellular glutathione levels and blocking the effects of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in HIV-infected cells. TNF levels are elevated in people with HIV infection and have been associated with accelerated HIV replication as well as the wasting syndrome resulting from HIV infection. Wu reported that in vitro NAC enhances the ability of cells from people with AIDS and ARC to form T-cell colonies. This effect was specific to T-cell colony-forming; no effect on mitogen stimulation was seen. Eylar reported that NAC enhanced T-cell mitogenesis and stimulated growth in cultures of peripheral blood T cells by at least 4- to 6-fold after two passages. Olivier reported that in vitro NAC prevents apoptosis and early cell death in lymphocytes from HIV-infected individuals. Malorni found that pretreatment with NAC decreased apoptosis and viral particles in HIV-infected U937 cells. Ho examined the effects of GSH and NAC on HIV-1 replication in human primary monocyte/macrophages cultured in vitro. Ficoll-gradient purified human monocytes were cultivated in vitro for 7-10 days and then infected with HIV-1. Infection was blocked or substantially reduced by GSH or NAC (5-20 mM). Significant reduction in the amount of virus released, as determined RT activity and secreted p24, was obtained when the cells were treated for 4 hours with over 10 mM of GSH or NAC. The inhibitory effects of GSH and NAC were concentration dependent. This anti-HIV-1 effect persisted in these cultures for at least 35 days without evidence of significant increase in HIV-1 expression. de Quay treated 9 HIV-infected men at various stages of disease with a single oral dose of NAC (30 mg/kg). The participants' plasma concentrations of glutathione and cysteine at baseline were significantly lower than in healthy controls. The intracellular concentration of glutathione correlated with the absolute CD4 lymphocyte counts: the concentration of glutathione in mononuclear cells was significantly lower in patients with more advanced immunodeficiency. A single oral dose of NAC increased the concentration of cysteine in plasma and mononuclear cells. 4 hours after NAC administration, intracellular glutathione concentrations were moderately higher than at baseline and at 2 hours. Staal published a review of the role of glutathione deficiency in HIV infection. Gomez enrolled 41 HIV-positive people with CD4 counts below 250 in a double-blind placebo controlled study of AZT (500 mg/day) with or without NAC (1200 mg every 8 hours orally). 13 participants withdrew due to adverse reactions, the most common being cutaneous rash, gastric upset, nausea and diarrhoea. At 6 months there were no significant differences between the groups in CD4 count or neopterin levels. No progressions occurred in either group. Clotat randomly assigned 32 people with AIDS (stage IV-C 1) to receive intravenous NAC (3000 mg diluted in 500 ml of 5% glucose infusion, administered over 1 hour) during 15 days (16 patients) or to constitute the control group (16 patients). All participants were also on AZT and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections. No major adverse reactions were evidenced except for a case of Lyell syndrome which appeared on the last day of therapy and recovered without sequelae. 3 patients developed minor cutaneous rash on the last 2 days. At the end of the study the mean of values of p24 antigen had a significant decrease in the group treated with NAC (171 +/- 187 pg/ml at entry versus 75 +/- 40 pg/ml at day 14. There were no changes in CD4 cell count or beta2-microglobulin. Significant changes were not found in the control group. Walker enrolled 16 asymptomatic patients with CD4 below 500 in a phase 1/11 dose-ranging and pharmacokinetics study of NAC (6 weeks of 3.7, 11, 33 and 100 mg/kg intravenous three times a week and then 600, 1200, 2400 and 4800 mg orally four times a day). Bioavailability of NAC was extremely poor, with plasma concentrations after oral treatment not A-Z OF TREATMENTS 175 [Page 176](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/182?q1=directories) reaching the levels required in vitro to inhibit HIV. No changes in CD4 count, p24 antigenaemia, or plasma viraemia were observed. References Buhl R et al. Systemic glutathione deficiency in symptom-free HIV-seropositive individuals.

Clin Exp Immunol 77:7-10, transcriptase inhibitor - the family of anti-HIV drugs to which L-697,661 and TIBOL also belong. These drugs act by inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme, but in a different way from the nucleoside analogue drugs like AZT, ddC and ddl. In test-tube studies, nevirapine inhibits HIV-1 but has no activity against HIV-2 or animal retroviruses such as FeLV or SIV. It is equally effective against AZT-sensitive and AZT-resistant strains of HIV-1. Nevirapine was formerly known by the codename BI-RG-587 and is manufactured by Boehringer-lngelheim. Current use Nevirapine is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Phase I studies showed that at doses less than 200 mg/day nevirapine had good antiviral effects, but HIV rapidly developed resistance to the drug. However, recent research suggests that doses of 400 mg/day are high enough to inhibit resistant strains, as well as having antiviral effects. A study using this dose found that p24 antigen levels were reduced and CD4 counts stabilised for nearly 6 months. Use in combinations Trials of nevirapine in combination with other anti-HIV drugs are underway. There are several reasons for favouring the combination of AZT plus nevirapine. The two drugs are synergistic against HIV, meaning that their combined antiviral effect is greater than would be expected from simply adding together their individual effects. In test-tube experiments, AZT also seems to delay the emergence of nevirapine-resistant strains, and nevirapine makes AZT-resistant HIV strains more sensitive to AZT. In one study in which people who were taking AZT started taking nevirapine (400 mg/day) as well, the combination resulted in a rapid drop in blood levels of p24 antigen which was sustained throughout the 28 weeks of the study. The average CD4 count increased significantly during the first four weeks of combination treatment but then fell again. 20% of nevirapine recipients had to stop taking the drug due to side-effects such as rashes and liver abnormalities. A phase 1/11 trial suggested that the addition of nevirapine to regimes of AZT plus ddC, AZT plus ddl or ddl monotherapy was well-tolerated and resulted in greater than 50% reduction in p24 antigen levels in the majority of antigenaemic people. However, by 56 days 5 out of these people had seen their antigen levels rise again, suggesting that resistance may have developed. Promising in vitro results were reported with the convergent combination of AZT, ddl and L-697,661. It was thought that this combination of drugs caused mutations in HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme which totally prevented viral replication or the infection of new cells. However, the research was subsequently shown to be flawed. Getting it No trials of nevirapine are currently taking place in Britain and the drug is not available through other means. Key research Wu and Koup reported that nevirapine is a selective noncompetitive inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase; Richman (1991a) reported that it binds to HIV-1 RT at the same site as the other non-nucleoside RT inhibitors. Merluzzi reported that in vitro, nevirapine inhibited the replication of HIV-1 but not HIV-2, FeLV or SIV. Nevirapine inhibited both a clinical HIV-1 isolate and the laboratory strain HTLV-IIIB at a concentration of 40 nM. Richman 176 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 177](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/183?q1=directories) (1991 b) found that nevirapine is equally effective in AZT-susceptible and AZT-resistant isolates of HIV-1 and that AZT and nevirapine exhibited synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 at all concentrations tested. Richman (1991a) reported that HIV-1 resistant to nevirapine emerges after passage in cell culture in the presence of drug. Resistance is conferred by a single mutation (tyrosinel81 -cysteine). These strains are cross-resistant with other non-nucleoside RT inhibitors, but not nucleoside-analog RT inhibitors. Larder (1992) reported that in AZT-resistant HIV strains the mutation at codon 181 significantly suppressed resistance to AZT, while it conferred resistance to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors. However, certain combinations of nucleoside analogues and NNRT inhibitors may result in the development of co-resistance. Cheeseman (1993) enrolled 21 HIV-positive people in a Phase I single-dose pharmacokinetics trial of nevirapine 2.5-400 mg). The terminal half-life and mean residence time exceeded 24 hours in all but one participant, indicating a prolonged disposition time in this population. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of nevirapine are appropriate for once-daily administration. A daily 12.5 mg dose is predicted to achieve trough concentrations in plasma in the range required to totally inhibit replication of wild-type HIV-1 in human T-cell culture. 36 HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts below 400 enrolled in a dose-escalation safety, tolerance and activity study of 12.5, 50, 200, or 400 mg/day nevirapine by mouth (ACTG 164). Another 30 patients with CD4 counts below 400 (50% with less than 3 months prior AZT treatment and 50% with more than 12 months prior AZT) enrolled in a dose-escalation study of the combination of 12.5, 50 and 200 mg/day nevirapine by mouth with AZT 600 mg/day (ACTG 168). Hattox reported that once-a-day dosing resulted in steady state plasma concentrations many fold higher than those required to inhibit replication of HIV-1 in cell culture. The half-life of the drug decreases at 200 mg and higher doses. Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and AZT are not affected by concomitant administration and dose adjustments are not required. Cheeseman (1992) reported that no consistent CD4 responses occurred. At 200 mg dose p24 dropped in the first week then returned to baseline; at 400 mg dose p24 levels remained suppressed. Duration of p24 suppression was increased both by combination with AZT and by increasing dose of nevirapine. Greenough found that in quantitative virological tests the typical pattern of response was a rapid decline in the p24 level with a nadir between 3 and 14 days and a subsequent slower return towards baseline levels by 6 weeks. Richman (1992) reported that isolates from all 16 patients tested have developed a 100-fold or greater reduction in susceptibility or a mutation of codon 181 in reverse transcriptase (previously associated with resistance) by week 8 and in 12/13 by week 4. The concomitant administration of AZT (600 mg/day) did not appear to delay resistance. Consequently the low-dose arms in both studies were discontinued. The single-agent nevirapine study is continuing at 400 mg/day since Havlir (1993a) reported that the steady-state plasma levels achieved with this dose exceed the concentrations necessary to inhibit nevirapine-resistant virus in vitro. Reductions in p24 antigen levels were seen in 8/10 p24 antigen positive adults treated with 400 mg/day monotherapy. CD4 counts were observed to stabilise for nearly six months. Havlir (1993b) reported the results of dose-escalation to 400 mg/day and 600 mg/day in combination with AZT, and 600 mg/day monotherapy, in ACTG 164. Nevirapine (400 mg/day) plus however, 5/15 people receiving 600 mg/day nevirapine monotherapy developed rash which was severe in one person. de Jong reported that an alternating regimen of one week nevirapine and three weeks AZT did not prevent the emergence of HIV strains resistant to nevirapine. Carr randomised 49 people with detectable p24 antigenaemia and 70-84 weeks' prior AZT use to receive either continued AZT monotherapy or 2 weeks of treatment with nevirapine monotherapy (200 mg/day) followed by combination therapy with nevirapine (400 mg/day) plus AZT. The combination group experienced a rapid 50% decline in serum p24 antigen levels associated with a median CD4 count increase of 25 cells, while AZT monotherapy recipients had a median of 5% decline in p24 and increase in CD4 count of 2 cells. The p24 reduction was sustained throughout the 28 week study in the majority of combination recipients. 20% of nevirapine recipients stopped treatment due to rash (16%) and liver function abnormalities (4%). Saag conducted a phase 1/11 study of the antiretroviral activity of nevirapine (100 mg twice daily, increasing to 200 mg twice daily at day 14) when added to AZT/ddC (n= 6), AZT/ddl (n= 7) or ddl alone (n= 11) in people with CD4 counts below 400 who had received prior antiretroviral therapy for at least 4 months (median 25 months). 18/18 participants with detectable viral antigen or RNA at baseline experienced at least a 50% decrease on addition of nevirapine. Virus suppression was maximal 2-6 weeks after initiation of nevirapine and was associated with a significant increase in CD4 counts averaging over 70%. Plasma RNA fell by an average of 15 fold. 17 participants remained on combination nevirapine therapy for more than 32 weeks, including 4 people with sustained CD4 count increases on 33-292% (mean 107%). Participants who failed therapy had viral strains that rapidly developed resistance to nevirapine. Johnson reported preliminary data from this study indicated that HIV strains resistant to all 3 drugs did develop. Chow (1993a) suggested that three-drug combinations including a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, AZT, and ddl could completely suppress viral replication in vitro. However, Larder (1993) subsequently reported that viable multi-drug resistant HIV-1 is selected in vitro, and Chow (1993b) has reported that the original results were in error.

It is being studied as a treatment for HIV encephalopathy. A-Z OF TREATMENTS 177 [Page 178](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/184?q1=directories) The most frequent side-effect of nimodipine is decreased blood pressure. It may also cause heart irregularities, flushing, headache, gastro-intestinal disorders, nausea and a feeling of warmth. It comes either as yellow tablets or a liquid for intravenous infusion. It is manufactured by Bayer under the tradename Nimotop. SNystatin Nystatin is an antifungal agent approved for the treatment of candidiasis. It is available as tablets, a mouthwash and in creams and ointments. Side-effects can include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea at high doses. In people with HIV nystatin treatment is often unsuccessful, and relapses of candidiasis are common. Nystatin is manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the tradename Nystan. * Octreotide Octreotide is an approved drug that is used to treat two rare forms of intestinal cancer. It is thought to enhance the absorption of water and electrolytes inthe intestines. It is a synthetic peptide that mimics the action of the naturally occurring hormone somatostatin. It has been shown to be more effective than standard anti-diarrhoea drugs in reducing the number and volume of bowel movements in people with HIV-related diarrhoea, and has also shown some promise as an experimental treatment for cryptosporidiosis. Octreotide comes as a liquid for intravenous injection. Side-effects can include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and bloating, flatulence and liver abnormalities. These may be reduced by injecting the drug between meals. Octreotide is also known as octreotide acetate and is manufactured by Sandoz under the tradename Sandostatin. * Ofloxacin Ofloxacin in an approved antibiotic that is used for the treatment of a variety of common bacterial infections. It may be useful in combination with other drugs as a treatment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. Side-effects can include gastro-intestinal problems, headache, anxiety, tremulousness and thrush. Ofloxacin comes in the form of tablets or a liquid for intravenous infusion. It is manufactured by Hoechst and Roussel under the tradename Tarivid. In the USA its tradename is Floxin. *OTC OTC is an anti-oxidant. Oxidative stress is a natural consequence of the use of nutrients by human cells. The molecules that make up cells contain pairs of electrons, one positive and one negative. These balanced pairs can be disrupted during the burning of energy in the cell, and positive electrons will begin to fly around, causing damage to the cell, including its genetic template, the DNA. Free radicals also damage the membrane of a cell, disrupting its absorption of nutrients and other functions essential to the health of a cell. Some bodily processes - like fighting infection - produce far greater quantities of free radicals than the body's anti-oxidant stores can cope with. Polluted air, water and food, cigarette smoke, recreational and treatment drugs are also potent sources of free radicals. Laboratory studies suggest that oxidative stress boosts HIV replication, and in turn, HIV replication boosts the production of free radicals, causing more oxidative stress. Sexually transmitted infections, repeated antibiotic use and poor nutrition also increase the likelihood of high levels of free radical activity. Free radicals have also been implicated in apoptosis or 'programmed cell death', a process in which instead of being activated by exposure to an antigen, T-cells first become anergic (literally, no energy) and then commit suicide. It is thought that this may be one cause of the loss of CD4 cells in people with HIV. OTC is believed to work primarily by increasing the level of glutathione in cells. Glutathione is necessary for life; it helps cells produce energy and it also helps protect them against oxidation. In addition, it may be an immunomodulator, necessary for T-cell activation. Test-tube studies suggest that OTC can stimulate the production of glutathione in laboratory mice. OTC is also known by its chemical name 2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate. Current use OTC is an unlicensed, experimental drug. A phase I study found no evidence on any effects on CD4 count, viral burden or intracellular glutathione levels. Another phase I study did observe significant increases in CD4/CD8 ratios. Reported side-effects include headache, light-headedness, confusion, rash and mild stomach upset. Use in combinations A phase II/111 trial of OTC for people who are taking antiretroviral drugs is underway in the USA. A study in mice suggested that taking OTC with AZT may reduce some of AZT's haematological side-effects. Key research Eck reported that glutathione levels are depressed in HIV-infected subjects; these findings were confirmed by Buhl at the NIH. Similar falls in glutathione occur in monkeys infected with SIV. No studies have been published showing the in vitro effects of OTC on HIV replication; these studies are under way. However, several studies (Williamson and Fidelus) have demonstrated the ability of OTC to deliver cysteine intracellularly and stimulate glutathione synthesis in mice. Staal published a review of the role of glutathione deficiency in HIV infection. Wilson reported that coadministration of OTC with AZT may reduce some of AZT's haematological toxicities. 178 A-Z OF 24 asymptomatic people with CD4 counts above 400 in a phase 1/11 dose-escalation trial of intravenous OTC. Participants were divided into four groups and received an initial IV dose of 3, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg; followed 2 weeks later by the same dose given twice weekly for 6 weeks. Increases in whole blood glutathione were observed in the highest dosage group after 6 weeks. No effects on CD4 count, viral load or proviral DNA were seen. People receiving the highest dose had a decline in beta2-microglobulin levels. One person receiving 100 mg/kg discontinued therapy due to severe headache. Other side-effects were self limited, including light-headedness, confusion and rash. Skowron enrolled 27 individuals with CD4 counts above 400 in a phase I trial of oral OTC. Participants received a single dose of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g followed 2 weeks later by 28 days of 0.5, 1.5 or 3 g three times daily. 3 additional participants received a placebo. No serious toxicities were seen. Mild gastric upset occurred at the highest dose. CD4/CD8 ratios in treated individuals rose significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Thompson reported that high doses of OTC were tolerated by dogs and rats without significant adverse effects. References Buhl R et al.

It has also been shown to have in vitro effects against HIV. It has been shown to prevent the secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine which is produced in excess in people with HIV infection. TNF makes people lose weight, can stop the bone marrow producing red cells, white cells and platelets and can damage the brain (it has been hypothesised that TNF is what causes HIV encephalopathy). TNF is also known to be one of the major factors which activates HIV from latency. It is theorised that blocking TNF production could have several beneficial effects for people with HIV infection. Oxpentifylline is known as pentoxifylline in the USA, or Trental - its British tradename. Current use Early trials in people have suggested that oxpentifylline does reduce levels of TNF, but so far there is no evidence that this is accompanied by a decrease in levels of HIV, an increase in CD4 count or by clinical benefits such as reduced disease progression. New York researchers who treated people with high levels of TNF with either oxpentifylline or placebo found that although TNF levels fell in the treated group, they also fell in the placebo group. This is thought to be because TNF levels in any individual may fluctuate considerably over time and the trial recruited people with high levels that were likely to fall regardless of any treatment. When used for its approved indications, oxpentifylline can have side-effects of nausea, dizziness and flushing. As it can lower the blood pressure, it has to be used in caution with people who have autonomic neuropathy or adrenal gland disease (both of which can cause falls in the blood pressure). Trials in people with HIV have reported occasional side-effects of nausea, fevers and vomiting. Use in combinations Test-tube studies suggest that oxpentifylline increases the anti-HIV effect of ddl. There are also indications that the combination of oxpentifylline and the discontinued tat inhibitor Ro 24-7429 could be very effective. Taking it Oxpentifylline comes as pink tablets which contain 400 mg of the drug. Getting it Oxpentifylline is a licensed drug for treating circulation problems. Some doctors may be willing to write prescriptions for people who wish to try oxpentifylline as an immune modulator. An open label study is taking place at Ealing Hospital in London. The drug is not available over-the-counter. Key research Fazely reported that oxpentifylline reduces the replication of HIV-1 in vitro in acutely infected PBMC and cultured human T cells. Oxpentifylline indirectly inhibited HIV-1, possibly through inhibition of tumour necrosis factor (TNF, cachectin), a naturally occurring cytokine with many functions in the human immune system. Folks reported that in vitro, recombinant TNF upregulates HIV-1 expression in chronically infected T-cell lines and Ito showed that in vitro, TNF antagonises the anti-HIV effect of AZT. Lahdevirta reported that in HIV-infected people, TNF levels are elevated and may be implicated in the progression of the disease as well as the wasting syndrome associated with HIV infection. Biswas (1993a) found that oxpentifylline indirectly inhibits HIV-1, possibly through inhibition of the NF-kB binding protein. Dezube (1990) reported that in cancer patients, oxpentifylline decreased TNF at the level of RNA. He speculated that oxpentifylline inhibits TNF indirectly through upregulation of cyclic AMP, TNF. Heinkelein reported that in vitro oxpentifylline down-regulated interferon, TNF-alpha and GM-CSF by HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, reducing in restricted biologic action by these cells. Fox found that oxpentifylline exerts a broad antiretroviral effect, inhibiting HIV replication in both acutely infected PBMC and chronically infected promonocytic cells. The drug inhibited both the synthesis and action of several cytokines, and that it inhibited viral expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Zhang reported that in vitro pentoxifylline enhances the anti-HIV effect of ddl. Biswas (1993b) reported that the in vitro effects of combined oxpentifylline and the tat inhibitor Ro 24-7429 were far more than additive, with maximal HIV inhibitory effects seen at concentrations low enough to avoid cytotoxicity. Dezube (1993) administered oxpentifylline to 25 people with AIDS and elevated TNF RNA levels, in ACTG 160. 17 completed treatment with 400 mg thrice daily. Median pre-treatment CD4 count was 32. Serum triglycerides (SG), a surrogate for cytokine activation, fell on average by 66 mg/dl. TNF mRNA levels fell in 10/16. HIV load decreased in 4 patients, remained stable in 10 and increased in 1. 5 and 7 patients have been on drug for longer than 6 months and longer than 1 year respectively. No patient in long-term follow-up has developed an 01 despite very low CD4 counts. Drug was well-tolerated, except for one oxpentifylline recipient who discontinued treatment due to recurrent fevers. A further 30 people have been enrolled at a dose of 800 mg three times daily. Reductions in TNF expression and TNF mRNA levels have been observed. Sonnabend enrolled 34 participants with CD4 counts below 300 in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of oxpentifylline (400 mg three times daily for 12 weeks). Oxpentifylline was well-tolerated. TNF production was generally lower in both the treatment and the placebo A-Z OF TREATMENTS 179 [Page 180](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/186?q1=directories) group at evaluations compared with baseline. The TNF level in the treated group was significantly lower than the placebo group at 8 weeks. No differences in HIV levels between the groups were observed. Mole treated 11 mildly symptomatic individuals who had never received anti-retroviral therapy in an open-label study of pentoxifylline (800 mg three times daily). No changes in serum TNF RNA, plasma HIV RNA, or CD4 counts were observed after more than 3 weeks of treatment. 3/1 1 discontinued treatment due to nausea, fever or vomiting. Navarro reported the resolution of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers in 3 of 4 people after 1-2 weeks of treatment with pentoxifylline 400 mg/day. Treatment was continued for 4 months, during which no relapses were observed. References Biswas DK et al. Pentoxifylline inhibits HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression by blocking NF-kB action.

Test-tube studies suggest that it can damage viral particles and inhibit HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme. Two research teams reported that in laboratory studies it inactivates HIV at concentrations which are non-toxic to human cells, but another team found that levels of ozone needed to kill animal viruses also resulted in 30% destruction of blood cells and haemoglobin. Current use Ozone is an unlicensed, experimental treatment. Despite the promising test-tube results, there is no clear evidence that ozone is a beneficial treatment for people with HIV. Two phase I studies showed no clear-cut effects on CD4 count or virus levels, and a phase II study showed no difference between the effects of ozone or placebo on a range of immunological and clinical measures. Ozone has been promoted by individuals in several countries who charge large fees for treatment, despite the lack of evidence of efficacy. Claims have been made that people have been 'cured' through ozone treatment, but no 'cured' person has ever been produced for verification. There have also been reports of several deaths as a direct result of intravenous ozone infusions. Most AIDS specialists and groups for people with HIV advise extreme caution in the use of this treatment. Taking it Ozone can be administered in several different ways. Blood can be removed from the individual, exposed to ozone and then reinfused. Alternatively, a machine can be used which generates ozone gas and delivers it into the rectum, where it is thought to be absorbed through the mucous membranes. The most dangerous method consists of injecting ozone gas directly into the bloodstream. Hydrogen peroxide injections are also sometimes used as part of, or independently of, ozone therapy. People who recommedn hydrogen peroxide also recommend drinking or bathing in it. However, doctors have reported one case in which a man with AIDS died after injecting himself with 35% hydrogen peroxide. Research Wells reported that the antiviral effects of ozone include viral particle disruption, reverse transcriptase inactivation and/or a perturbation of the ability of the virus to bind to its receptor on target cells. Freeberg and Carpendale (1991) reported that ozone inactivated HIV at non-toxic concentrations, but Wagner found that at concentrations required to inhibit animal viruses, ozone induced 30-percent haemolysis and destruction of extracellular haemoglobin. Bocci theorised that ozone induces the production of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon. Carpendale (1993) reported that 4/5 HIV-positive men with diarrhoea of unknown origin improved when treated with diarrhoea. However, the responders all had relatively high CD4 counts, and diarrhoea can resolve spontaneously, particularly at higher CD4 counts. Garber performed a phase I study of ozone blood treatments in 10 HIV-positive individuals. No significant toxicity was observed. Three participants with moderate immunodeficiency showed improvement in surrogate markers. In a phase II controlled and randomized double-blinded study comparing reinjection of ozone-treated blood and reinjection of unprocessed blood for 8 weeks, followed by a 4-week observation period, ozone had no significant effect on haematologic, biochemical or clinical toxicity when compared with placebo. CD4 cell count, interleukin-2, gamma-interferon, beta2-microglobulin, neopterin and p24 antigen were also unaffected by both treatment arms. Hooker conducted an open study of ozone-treated blood in the treatment of 9 HIV-positive individuals. No significant change in mean absolute (or percentage) CD4 count was seen after 4 or 8 weeks of treatment. The HIV p24 antigen titre did not change significantly during treatment. One participant became weakly p24-antigenaemic during treatment, while another who was weakly antigenaemic at baseline became equivocal during therapy. The treatment was well tolerated; there was no bruising or local pain after the intramuscular injections. Hirschtick reported the case of an individual who died after injecting himself with hydrogen peroxoxide. Mayer reported the development of paranoid hallucinatory psychoses in a person receiving ozone therapy. References Bocci V.

These are assembled into a 'virus-like particle' (VLP). In people with HIV, antibodies to p24 tend to decline or disappear at around the same time that they progress to ARC or AIDS. By giving injections of 'fake' p24, it is hoped that the immune response to the protein will be augmented and sustained for longer, perhaps delaying disease progression. p24.VLP is manufactured by the Oxford-based company British Biotechnology. Current use p24.VLP is an unlicensed, experimental drug. A study in uninfected people showed that it can successfully cause the production of anti-p24 antibodies in people, although it remains to be seen whether it has similar effects in HIV-positive people, or whether these antibodies have any protective effect against disease progression. The majority of recipients reported irritation at the injection site and headache, nausea and fatigue. Two people developed fevers soon after injection. Trials are underway testing the effects of various doses of the vaccine at various stages of HIV infection. Current developments As well as studying the vaccine in a conventional adjuvanted formulation (using aluminium hydroxide), researchers are testing an unadjuvanted form of p24.VLP to determine whether a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response can be induced. Key research British Biotechnology has developed a novel means of producing particulate antigens in yeast. Genetic engineering of an HIV p1 7/p24 fusion gene produces an expression plasmid containing 25% of p17 and 79% of p24. The plasmid is introduced into yeast cells which are grown to high cell density in a medium containing glucose. Expression of the fusion protein is then induced, producing high yields of p24.VLPs. p24.VLPs are particles of approximately 80 nm in diameter. The p24 antigen component of the hybrid has been demonstrated to be on the surface of the particles by gold immunolabelling techniques. During the late stages of HIV infection, p24 antibody wanes and up to 18 months after the loss of antibody p24 antigenaemia reappears in up to 47% of individuals. De Wolf and Pedersen demonstrated that the risk of developing AIDS is greatly increased in individuals exhibiting undetectable or falling titres of p24 antibody and in those exhibiting the secondary p24 antigenaemia. Moreover, Cheingsong-Popov showed that an initially low titre p24 antibody response following HIV infection in haemophiliacs was associated with a significantly faster progression to AIDS than a high titre response. These data suggest, indirectly, that high titres of p24 antibody may be important in maintaining a disease-free state. It is theorised that vaccination of seropositive individuals with core protein (p24) attached to virus-like particles (VLPs) may enhance p24 antibody and cellular responses and prolong the disease-free state in HIV infection. Martin and Weber reported a phase I clinical study of the safety, toxicity and immunogenicity of p24.VLP in 16 healthy HIV seronegative men. 9 subjects received 100 pg and 7 received 500 pig subcutaneously on weeks 0, 4 and 12. Following an interim analysis 15/16 received a fourth immunisation of 500 pg intramuscularly at week 36. Titratable antibody responses to p24 were detected in 4/16 subjects after three immunisations and in 11/15 subjects following the fourth immunisation. Titratable Ty antibody responses were detected in 12/15 subjects following the fourth immunisation. The relationship between p24 and Ty antibody titre is highly significant. T-helper cell responses to p24 were observed in 12/16 subjects. Cytotoxic T cell responses were not observed. Injection site reactions were reported in 14/16 patients. 14/16 experienced systemic adverse events such as nausea, headache and fatigue which may not be related to immunisation. Significant fever occurred in 2 people within 12 hours of immunisation. References Cheingsong-Popov R et al.

SPaclitaxel Paclitaxel is an intravenous anti-cancer drug that is sometimes used for the treatment of refractory ovarian cancer. It is being studied for the treatment of AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Side-effects reported include sore throat and mouth, neutropenia, hair loss and numbness of the fingers and toes. It is approved in the USA under the tradename Taxol. * Paromomycin Paromomycin is an antibiotic which is licensed in the USA for treating intestinal ambiasis and giardiasis. It is not marketed in the UK, but is available for use on a named patient basis. It is currently being studied as a treatment for cryptosporidiosis, with some success. When taken as tablets, the drug only acts in the gut - where its effects are needed - and is not absorbed into the bloodstream. Its side-effects can include gastro-intestinal upset and diarrhoea. Paromomycin is manufactured by Pharmacia under US tradename A-Z OF TREATMENTS 181 [Page 182](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/188?q1=directories) * Passive immunotherapy Passive immunotherapy is a process in which plasma is donated by healthy HIV-positive people who have a high CD4 count and whose plasma has been found to have high levels of neutralising antibodies (those which prevent the growth of HIV in laboratory tests). The plasma from several donors is then pooled so that it is likely to contain antibodies effective against many strains of HIV and treated to kill HIV and any other disease-causing organisms. It is then infused, usually at monthly intervals, into people with ARC or AIDS who have lost their own ability to make the antibodies. The therapy stems from the observation in some studies that healthy HIV-infected individuals have a high level of neutralising antibodies against HIV whilst people with AIDS have at best low levels of such antibodies but a high level of virus in the blood. Passive immunotherapy is called passive because it involves giving someone else's antibodies to the recipients, as opposed to therapies like vaccines which encourage the body to make its own antibodies. Passive immunotherapy is also known as passive immunisation or passive hyperimmune therapy (sometimes abbreviated to PHIT). Current use Passive immunotherapy is an unlicensed, experimental therapy. Several studies have tried to measure its effectiveness by looking for reductions in p24 antigen levels; however this marker may be meaningless since the infusions are likely to contain anti-p24 antibodies which may simply 'mop up' free p24 antigen without making any difference to the underlying disease process. Other studies have not been properly controlled e.g. they have compared plasma infusions to a placebo rather than to plasma from HIV-negative people, which would allow a better comparison of the significance of the anti-HIV antibodies contained in the treatment. Nevertheless, some studies have suggested that passive immunotherapy can improve or delay the development of new symptoms, especially when used at relatively high CD4 counts. It has also been suggested that the treatment can reduce levels of detectable HIV (which is more significant than a reduction in p24 antigen) in the bloodstream. Despite some reports in the press, studies of passive immunotherapy have not shown any statistically significant improvement in survival. Side-effects of the treatment can include headaches, nausea, fevers, coldness in the hands and feet and transient rashes. There have been reports that two plasma recipients may have become infected with hepatitis C, possibly as a result of inadequate sterilisation of the donated plasma. Donating the plasma does not appear to be at all harmful; in fact, it appears to be beneficial because it stimulates the body to produce more antibodies, raising levels to be higher than before donation of plasma. Only blood plasma is donated; blood cells are separated off by plasmapheresis and returned to the donor. Taking it One study found that when regular treatment with passive immunotherapy was stopped, p24 levels rebounded to levels higher than before treatment and were accompanied by severe clinical deterioration. This suggests that severely immunosuppressed people should not stop passive immunotherapy without starting an alternative treatment. Getting it An open-label study of passive immunotherapy is currently taking place at Ealing Hospital in London. Key research Although naturally developing anti-HIV antibodies may be inadequate to control disease progression, it is hypothesized that methods to boost or elicit high titre antibodies in AIDS patients may be beneficial in limiting viral spread or preventing new infection. Fultz found that, in macaques and mangabeys, the presence of neutralizing antibodies or antibodies that inhibit SIV reverse-transcriptase activity did not correlate with protection from clinical disease. Jackson treated 6 people with advanced ARC or AIDS for at least 1.5 years with plasma from donors with high titres of p24 antibodies. In the period immediately following each infusion, there was a loss of HIV antigenaemia, a reduction in the fraction of participants with positive plasma and lymphocyte HIV cultures, fewer opportunistic infections and improvements in symptom score, weight and Karnofsky performance score. Karpas (1988) enrolled 10 people in an open trial of passive immunotherapy. All showed clearance of HIV antigenaemia after monthly infusions of immune plasma. In addition, Karpas (1990) reported dramatic loss of detectable viraemia, as measured by polymerase chain reaction assays for both plasma HIV DNA and RNA, after the second infusion in all 8 participants tested. Vittecoq conducted a phase I study of the safety and efficacy of passive immunotherapy in 18 people diagnosed with AIDS for longer than 6 months and with CD4 counts below 100. Participants were randomised to receive transfusions (every 2 weeks for 14 weeks) of either heat-inactivated anti-HIV antibody-rich plasma from 9 asymptomatic HIV-positive donors with CD4 counts above 400 and no detectable p24 antigen (Group 1), or seronegative fresh-frozen plasma from 56 HIV-negative healthy donors (Group 2). All participants were receiving AZT (500 mg/day) and aerosolised pentamidine as PCP prophylaxis. The number of Ols was significantly reduced in Group 1 (2 vs 8). One death occurred in each group, due to recurrent CMV disease. p24 antigen levels dramatically declined in Group 1 and 6/9 became p24 antibody positive by day 2 after the first transfusion; p24 levels remained unchanged in Group 2. In the post-transfusion period, after week 20, severe clinical deterioration occurred in Group 1: 8/9 developed poorly-tolerated fever; pancytopenia. Antigenaemia returned to positive, at a level higher than before treatment in most cases. Reintroduction of treatment for Group 1 at week 34 was associated with clear regression of symptoms in 4/9; between weeks 34 and 42 three participants died. LeFrere enrolled 86 individuals with symptomatic HIV infection and a CD4 count below 200 in a placebo-controlled phase II study of passive immunotherapy (300 ml of plasma rich in p24 antibodies every 14 days over a 1 year period) versus infusions of standard seronegative plasma. Placebo recipients had a 3-fold greater probability of developing new AIDS-defining events than immunotherapy recipients. 26 people receiving passive immunotherapy had no new events compared to 13 of the controls. No significant difference in the number of deaths was observed (7 in the treated group and 11 in the control group). Jacobson conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of human anti-HIV hyperimmune plasma. 63 people with AIDS received 250 mL of either HIV-immune plasma or HIV antibody-negative plasma every 4 weeks. Although nonsignificant trends toward improved survival and delayed occurrence of a new opportunistic infection were noted, no significant effects on absolute CD4 lymphocyte counts or quantitative HIV viraemia were seen. The only notable toxicity was the allergenicity to be expected from infusing plasma products, usually manifesting as urticaria (nettle-rash). These results do not rule out the potential usefulness of passive immunization with different preparations, but did fail to demonstrate clinical benefit of the product studied. Levy randomised 220 people with AIDS or severe ARC and CD4 counts below 200 receive anti-HIV plasma or placebo (500 or 250 cc intravenously each month). The anti-HIV plasma was derived from healthy HIV-positive donors, pooled, and sterilized with beta-propiolactone. At 12 months no overall differences in survival or CD4 counts were observed. In a sub-group analysis of 72 patients with CD4 counts between 50 - 200, treated patients had significantly increased CD4 counts compared with placebo recipients 182 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 183](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/189?q1=directories) (32.7 cell increase vs. 2.5 cell decrease). However, significantly better survival was not observed among these treated patients. Osther treated 14 HIV-positive individuals for 5-7 days with intravenous infusions of highly purified anti-HIV antibodies derived from pigs which had been inoculated with killed HIV particles (a substance known as PASSHIV-1). 2/14 participants were retreated 3 months later with PASSHIV-1 for an additional 5 days to evaluate side-effects from retreatment with porcine immunoglobulins. 10 had no side-effects from PASSHIV-1 therapy, 3 experienced transient urticarial eruptions which responded to antihistamine administration and one participant who received concomitant administration of human gammaglobulin experienced serum sickness. All patients demonstrated a significant improvement in fatigue, weight, fever, polyneuropathy, bronchitis, candidiasis, diarrhoea and dermatitis. 1/5 with KS demonstrated a greater than 50% improvement. Mean CD4 cell counts in the group rose from 143 to 234 4-6 months following completion of therapy. 4 p24 antigenaemic participants became antigen-negative after treatment. References Fultz PN et al.

SPentamidine Pentamidine is an approved anti-protozoal drug used for the treatment and prevention of PCP. It can be administered by either intravenous or intramuscular injection, or converted into a mist by a machine called a nebuliser then inhaled into the lungs. Intravenous pentamidine is the standard treatment for PCP. Aerosolised pentamidine is used as a form of prophylaxis against PCP in people with CD4 counts below 200 or who have had a prior episode of PCP. As a form of prophylaxis it is less effective than co-trimoxazole. Aerosolised pentamidine may also have a role in the treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP. Aerosolised pentamidine is well-tolerated, but some people may experience coughs and bronchospasm. This is usually preventable by pretreatment with inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists. If people who are taking aerosolised pentamidine do develop PCP, it can be harder to diagnose because the Pneumocystis organisms may not be detectable in samples of spit or fluid from the lungs (obtained by a technique called broncoalveolar lavage) and chest X-rays may be unusual. Unusual forms of Pneumocystis infection may occur outside the lungs, where the inhaled drug does not provide any protection. In a few cases the drug has been associated with collapsed lung (pneumothorax). The effectiveness of aerosolised pentamidine prophylaxis seems to be significantly dependent on the size of the aerosol particles generated by the nebulising machine (finer particles penetrate into the lung better than large particles), the position of the individuals body while inhaling the drug and the individuals breathing pattern. Side-effects of intravenous or intramuscular pentamidine include kidney damage, hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, blood abnormalities and irregular heartbeat. Although in vitro pentamidine inhibits Cryptococcus, and Cryptococcus is thought usually to enter the body through the lungs, there is no evidence that aerosolised pentamidine prevents cryptococcal meningitis.

SPeptide T Peptide is an artificially produced form of VIP, a natural protein found in the brain which is involved in transmitting messages (a neurotransmitter). This protein is very similar in structure to part of gpl 20, the protein on the surface of HIV particles which binds onto the CD4 molecule on some human cells. It is theorised that by injecting excess levels of peptide T in blood and tissues, they might bind onto CD4 on helper cells and thus prevent HIV from doing so. Peptide T is manufactured by Advanced Peptides Inc. Current use Peptide T is an unlicensed, experimental drug. Phase I safety trials to date have found no clear evidence of any antiviral effects. However, improvements have been reported in HIV-related mental problems. New studies are examining further the effect of peptide T on HIV brain disease. A-Z OF TREATMENTS 183 [Page 184](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/190?q1=directories) One open study suggested that it may be an effective treatment for HIV-related peripheral neuropathy. However, the only controlled efficacy study of Peptide T which has been completed to date found found no beneficial effects of the drug on peripheral neuropathy or neuropschological function in 108 participants with AIDS. Other Phase II studies are underway. The only reported side-effects from peptide T have been minor, such as rash, nasal congestion and, in one study, 'second puberty' (hirsutism, acne, increased libido, wet dreams, increase in testosterone). Users have also reported bouts of extreme anger which they attribute to the drug. Taking it Peptide T comes as a liquid which is taken intranasally (by squirting it up the nose). It can be obtained from buyers' clubs in the USA. No clinical trials are taking place in Britain. Key research In vitro, peptide T has been reported to prevent HIV from infecting CD4 cells by blocking receptor sites on the CD4 molecule. Peptide T mimics and competes with both a section of VIP and a section of gpl 20, the HIV surface molecule which binds to the CD4 receptor. Buzy reported that peptide T and VIP can prevent gpl 20-induced neuronal cell death in vitro. Bridge (1991) reported the extended Phase I testing of Peptide T (intravenously in doses ranging from 0.1 to 3.2 mg/kg/day) in an open trial. 14 people with AIDS or ARC were treated for 12 weeks and following a 4-week off-drug period, the first 6 participants finishing the intravenous testing were continued on intranasal drug, 25 mg/day, for 8 weeks. Minimal evidence of toxicity was found. Performance increments in cognitive and neuromotor function were observed in participants with moderate neuropsychologic impairment compared with untreated controls. Changes in constitutional symptoms included weight gain averaging 2 kg and reported improved sense of well-being. The latter findings were independent of variation in cognitive and neuromotor function. Measures of immunologic function and antiviral activity did not change significantly during the study. Julander treated 7 people with symptomatic HIV infection with Peptide T (1 -2 mg intravenously twice daily for 4 weeks) and 3 with placebo. HIV was isolated before and after treatment from all participants but in 2/5 treated patients p24 antigenaemia declined (but rose after cessation of treatment). CD4 counts rose transiently on treatment and 4 treated individuals had improved neuropathology. Hypotension was observed in one participant. Bridge (1992) evaluated cognitive neuromotor change in controlled and open 12 week trials in 56 people with AIDS receiving Peptide T (1.2, 6 or 30 mg/day intranasally or 0.2-3.2 mg/kg/day intravenously). No toxicity was observed. Repeat measures ANOVA for dose and time effects performed on the raw scores from 5 tests with two alternate forms available revealed no learning effects in controls and no baseline differences among groups. Tests of visual memory, spatial perception, episodic memory revealed near significant dose and time effects in patients. Improvement scores correlated significantly with reductions in CSF neuronal killing and CSF VIP concentrations. The lowest dose group (1.2 mg/day intranasally) showed the greatest improvement in neuropsychologic function. MacFadden reported that of 9 individuals with HIV-related peripheral neuropathy treated with Peptide T (subcutaneously at an initial dose of 10 mg daily, with 2 patients tapered to 2.5 mg in order to determine the minimal effective dose), all experienced either complete or subjectively significant resolution of lower limb pain, with effects being noticed as early as two days after initiation of treatment. The pain-free interval persisted for the duration of the treatment (for 3 to 70 weeks) but pain recurred gradually within one week of stopping the drug, resolving upon reinstitution of treatment. In 2 participants, decreasing the dose to 2.5 mg/day resulted in recurrence of pain, which resolved when the dose was increased to 5 mg. No adverse drug effects were noted. Brudner reported that in the only phase II double-blind efficacy trial of Peptide T conducted to date, there were no statistically significant differences between Peptide T (6 mg/day for 12 weeks) and placebo in the treatment of painful peripheral neuropathy. The drug also seemed to have no effects on neuropschological functions. The study enrolled 108 participants with AIDS. References Bridge P et al. Improvement in AIDS patients on peptide T.

SPhenytoin Phenytoin is an approved anti-convulsant drug that is used for the treatment of epilepsy. It comes in the form of tablets or a liquid for intravenous injection. Phenytoin can be used by people with HIV to relieve pain associated with peripheral neuropathy. Side-effects, which are usually dose-related, can include dizziness, headaches, decreased coordination, nausea and gingival hyperplasia. Young women may experience growth of body hair. Taking phenytoin at the same time as oral contraceptives may decrease the effectiveness of the contraceptives while increasing the rate at which the drug is metabolised and excreted by the body. Phenytoin is available as a generic (non-brandname) product, and is also manufactured by Parke-Davis under the tradename Epanutin. In the USA, it is marketed under the tradename Dilantin. * Platelet factor 4 Recombinant platelet factor 4 (rPF4) is an experimental, synthetic version of a naturally occurring protein which inhibits angiogenesis (blood vessel formation). It is administered by subcutaneous injection and is being tested as a treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma. No side-effects have been reported. * PMEA Like AZT, ddl and ddC, PMEA is a modified form of one of the building blocks of DNA (known as nucleosides). When HIV replicates in the presence of these nucleoside analogue drugs, the virus' reverse transcriptase enzyme incorporates the drug in the place of a normal nucleoside in the growing DNA strand. This prevents the proper assembly of viral genetic material and halts viral replication. Early laboratory studies suggest that PMEA could potentially be more effective than existing drugs because it survives in cells for much longer. AZT breaks down in a cell after only 2-3 hours, but PMEA persists for up to 20 hours. PMEA may also be able to work inside a wider range of cells than other nucleoside analogue drugs. 184 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 185](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/191?q1=directories) Tests with macaque monkeys suggest that pre-treatment with PMEA may be able to protect them from infection on exposure to SIV, the monkey equivalent of HIV. PMEA is manufactured by Gilead Sciences, a California pharmaceutical company. Current use PMEA is an unlicensed, experimental drug that is still in the early stages of research. It is given by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Trials are underway in the USA, including a pilot study of the combination of PMEA plus AZT. Three studies are also investigating BisPom PMEA, a compound that breaks down into PMEA in the body and can be taken by mouth. Side-effects seen to date include neutropenia, mild liver abnormalities and inflammation or ulcers of the urethra. Tests in mice suggested that PMEA may be harmful to the embryo if taken during pregnancy, causing resorption of pregnancy, thymus damage, low birth weight and premature death. Key research De Clercq reported that PMEA inhibits HIV-induced cytopathogenicity in MT-4 cells and HIV expression in H9 cells at a concentration of 1.6-2 \u00fdIM. PMEA has been shown to be effective in delaying or preventing the development of retrovirus-induced diseases in mice (Gangemi), cats (Egberink) and monkeys (Balzarini, 1992). Balzarini's (1990) in vitro results suggest that PMEA may be more effective at inhibiting HIV replication when administered on an intermittent schedule. In vivo, PMEA was more effective at preventing Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV)-induced tumours in mice when given as a single dose at the time of viral inoculation rather than divided over several administrations. This effect was observed independent of dose. Tsai treated 18 macaques with PMEA subcutaneously for 48 hours and then inoculated them with SIV. Treatment continued for 28 days. 6 months later only 5 had detectable levels of SIV in the blood or tissues. Of 12 macaques treated with the highest dose, only 2 had detectable levels of virus after 6 months. Walker conducted a phase 1/11 study of PMEA (1, 3 or 10 mg/kg daily by intravenous infusion for at least 12 weeks) among HIV-positive individuals with CD4 counts below 500. Preliminary results on 10 participants who received 1 mg/kg showed an increase in mean CD4 count from 200 to 252 and a decrease in serum p24 levels from 209 to 76. 4 people, all with baseline CD4 counts below 100, have developed neutropenia. 7 developed mild reversible hepatic transaminase elevations and 4 experienced self-limiting urethral inflammation or ulceration. Lee reported that PMEA was either ineffective in preventing Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV) infection in the offspring of pregnant transgenic Mov-14 mice, or embryotoxic depending on dose. Toxic effects were resorption of pregnancy, low birth weight, neonatal death and severe lymphoid depletion on the thymus in neonatal mice.

SPrimaquine Primaquine is a tablet-form antibiotic that is sometimes used in combination with clindamycin as a treatment for PCP. It is also used for treating malaria. The most common side-effects in Caucasian people are gastro-intestinal such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Black people who have a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency - a condition that affects about 10% of Black Americans and is even more common in Africans and people of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern origin - are susceptible to anaemia caused by the destruction of blood cells. Primaquine is available as a generic (non-brandname) product. * Procarbazine Procarbazine is an approved oral anti-cancer drug used primarily as part of the MOPP regimen in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease. It inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. Side-effects can include bone marrow suppression, nausea and vomiting. It is taken in the form of capsules. Procarbazine is manufactured by Cambridge under the tradename Natulan. * PRO-MACE/MOPP PRO-MACE/MOPP is a chemotherapy regimen consisting the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. * Pyrazinamide Pyrazinamide is an approved oral anti-tuberculosis drug used in combination regimens. Side-effects include hepatitis, gastro-intestinal upsets, rash and gout. The drug should not be used in people with liver impairment. It is manufactured by Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd under the tradename Zinamide.

It has also been tested in combination with dapsone as prophylaxis for PCP. For people who cannot tolerate co-trimoxazole, it may be used on its own or in combination with leucovorin or sulphadoxine to treat isosporiasis and prevent relapses. Side-effects include bone marrow suppression and skin rashes. Pyrimethamine tablets are manufactured by Wellcome under the tradename Daraprim. The combinbation of pyrimethamine and sulphadoxine in one tablet is manufactured by Roche under the tradename Fansidar. The combination of pyrimethamine and dapsone in one tablet is manufactured by Wellcome under the tradename Maloprim. * Ribavirin Like AZT, ddl and ddC, ribavirin is a modified form of one of the building blocks of DNA (known as nucleosides). When HIV replicates in the presence of these nucleoside analogue drugs, the virus' reverse transcriptase enzyme incorporates the drug in the place of a normal nucleoside in the growing DNA strand. This prevents the proper assembly of viral genetic material and halts viral replication. Current use Although the other nucleoside analogue drugs all seem to have some activity against HIV, many trials have shown no evidence of benefits such as a reduction in disease progression or HIV levels or an increase in CD4 count. The ability of these trials to reach a definitive conclusion on the efficacy has been questioned; one analysis which combined the findings of four placebo-controlled trials suggested that ribavirin did indeed reduce the risk of disease progression; however, it is possible for errors to occur in this kind of post hoc statistical analysis. Ribavirin is no longer being investigated as a single drug treatment for HIV. It has few reported side-effects; anaemia has occurred in some treated people. Use in combinations There is some laboratory evidence suggesting that the combination of ddl and ribavirin may be effective. For more information, see the entry on ddl. The combination of AZT plus ribavirin has been found to be antagonistic. A study of isoprinosine in combination with ribavirin found no evidence of beneficial immunological or virological effects, but participants experienced a generalised loss of white blood cells, including CD4 cells, which partially recovered 1 month after the drugs were discontinued. Getting it Ribavirin is a licensed treatment for respiratory syncytial virus in children and is also effective in Lassa fever. While they are not supposed to prescribe a drug for indications other than those for which it is licensed, some doctors may be willing to write prescriptions for people who wish to try ribavirin as an anti-HIV drug. It is not available over-the-counter and is not currently in clinical trials in Britain. Key research The Spanish Ribavirin Trial Group conducted a multicentre, placebo-controlled, prospectively randomised trial of ribavirin (15 mg/kg daily by mouth) among 152 CDC group III HIV-infected individuals. Mean treatment time was 39 weeks. Of 133 evaluable participants, 9/67 placebo recipients (13.4%) progressed to CDC Groups IVA, C1, or D compared to 6/66 (9%) in the ribavirin group. Progressions to group IVC2 were 7 (10.4%) and 9 (13.6%), respectively. These differences are not statistically significant. There were no clinically or statistically significant differences in CD4 cell counts, total lymphocytes, total white cells or CD4/CD8 ratios between the groups during treatment and no clinically important side-effects were noted. Roberts (1990a) found no demonstrable beneficial effect on virologic or immunologic HIV surrogate markers (coculture of PBMCs, p24 antigen, beta2-microglobulin, functional lymphocyte markers) in an open phase 1 study comparing two daily doses of oral ribavirin (1200 and 1600 mg) for 12 weeks. The study enrolled 16 HIV-positive men with lymphadenopathy or early ARC. Mild clinical adverse reactions and anaemia were observed in both groups. The 1600 mg group experienced significant reductions in total lymphocytes, T lymphocytes (CD2 cells) and T lymphocyte subsets (CD4 and CD8 cells) which were attributed to a direct ribavirin lymphotoxic effect. Roberts (1990b) enrolled 164 HIV-positive men with lymphadenopathy in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Participants received either one of two daily doses of oral ribavirin (600 and 800 mg) or a placebo for 24 weeks followed by a 4-week interval during which they did not receive the study drug. Although there was considerable interlaboratory variation in HIV isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the combined data indicated that ribavirin did not significantly suppress HIV activity (on measurement of reverse transcriptase activity) after week 6 or reduce serum p24 antigenaemia. Spector reported that there was no consistent reduction in p24 antigenaemia or decrease in HIV isolation among participants in contrast to the effects seen with AZT. Vernon enrolled 215 HIV-1-infected adults in a double-blind trial of ribavirin at 600 or 800 mg/day or placebo. After 24 weeks no effect on disease progression or virological or immunological markers was seen. Gilson treated 5 HIV-positive men with ribavirin (400 mg thrice daily (14-18 mg/kg) by mouth for 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks at 600 mg three times a day, subject to satisfactory tolerance at the lower dose) as part of an open pilot study of ribavirin in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers. 4 completed the 12 weeks of treatment, p24 antigen was not detected at any stage in 3 participants; 2 had low-level antigenaemia at baseline which increased during treatment. 4 participants had quantifiable viraemia before treatment and viraemia was unchanged or had increased by the end of treatment. Treatment was well tolerated although lymphocyte counts and haemoglobin fell in all patients. CD4 counts were not done. These findings suggest that HIV replication may have increased during ribavirin therapy in at least some patients. Senay gave open ribavirin treatment to 39 people who had previously participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of oral ribavirin (21 ribavirin, 18 placebo). Ribavirin was well tolerated; dosage had to be reduced in 7 participants, 3 because of anaemia and 4 following constitutional symptoms. Comparable falls in CD4 lymphocytes were observed in both groups. There was no difference in progression from CDC group II to III between those who had previously received placebo and those previously treated with ribavirin. Snell conducted a meta-analysis of 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of ribavirin in people with CDC Stage III and IV disease. In each study fewer participants progressed in the ribavirin treated group, but in only one study did this effect attain conventional statistical significance; in 2 of the studies the statistical power to detect a difference was very low due to the small total number of AIDS progressions. In numerical terms 34/333 (10%) individuals randomized to ribavirin progressed to AIDS during or within 4 weeks of halting therapy, compared with 35/205 (17%) randomized to placebo. Meta-analysis revealed an estimated 47.5% reduction in risk of progression on ribavirin compared with placebo. Crumpacker (1987) reported the results from 3 uncontrolled phase I trials of increasing duration (14 days, 8 weeks and 12 months) among people with ARC or AIDS. Ribavirin was well tolerated, with the only significant toxicity being anaemia requiring transfusion in 1 participant with AIDS who received the drug for 8 weeks. 6/9 participants who were viraemic at baseline became negative during ribavirin treatment. 6/9 participants with AIDS had a twofold improvement in lymphoproliferative response to at least one lectin with ribavirin treatment. Mean survival from first episode of P. carinii pneumonia was 17.3 months in patients with AIDS receiving 8 weeks of ribavirin and 21.2 months in patients with AIDS receiving prolonged treatment. Although animal data suggested that ribavirin does not cross the 186 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 187](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/193?q1=directories) blood-brain barrier, Crumpacker (1986) found that the drug was detectable in the CSF of participants in the 8-week study. Connor reported that ribavirin (6 or 10 mg/kg/day for 60 days) was well-tolerated by 11 children with symptomatic HIV infection. The mean systemic availability of oral ribavirin was 42.3%. After 60 days of ribavirin administration, mean trough concentrations in plasma of 2.6 and 4.1 IpM were obtained. Ribavirin penetrated well into the cerebrospinal fluid, achieving 70% of the concentration in plasma at steady state. Vogt found that ribavirin antagonised the anti-HIV effect of AZT under a variety of experimental conditions, apparently by antagonising the phosphorylation of AZT. However, Balzarini (1990) reported that the combination of ribavirin with either ddlor ddDAPR enhanced their efficacy against MSV and HIV replication in vitro and MSV-induced tumour formation in vivo. Balzarini (1991) found that this was due to ribavirin stimulating the conversion of ddl to its antivirally active metabolite ddATP. Schulof enrolled 15 asymptomatic men in a 3 month trial of isoprinosine (4 g/day) plus ribavirin (800 or 1200 mg/day). No unexpected toxicities were observed. No change in serum p24 levels was seen in 2 participants treated in the 800 mg ribavirin group. Treatment was associated with a generalized lymphopenia affecting all lymphocyte subsets including CD4, which was partially reversible 1 month after stopping treatment. Most of the men remained anergic on DTHS skin testing. No improvements were noted in in vitro lymphoproliferative responses to antigens or in NK cell activity (which decreased significantly in the 1200 mg/day ribavirin group). Although well tolerated at the doses employed, the combination of ribavirin and isoprinosine produced an unexpected generalized lymphopenia and did not exhibit HIV-suppressive or immunorestorative effects.

American trials showed that it could reduce the number of MAI organisms detectable in the blood. These studies also hinted that it might also be able to delay the onset of symptoms and possibly improve survival, but these findings are somewhat uncertain because the trials were not designed to be able to detect clinical benefits. Rifabutin prophylaxis is not standard practice in Britain. Some centres routinely encourage people with CD4 counts below 100 to take it, while others are less enthusiastic because of the evidence about its efficacy is inconclusive and because they have concerns that drug-resistant strains of MAI might develop. Rifabutin is also being tested in combination with other drugs as part of treatment regimes for MAI. It is manufactured by Pharmacia under the tradename Mycobutin. Side-effects Side-effects of rifabutin can include rash, fever, nausea, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and hepatitis. In early 1994 there were several reports of eye problems among people receiving rifabutin. 23 out of 60 people in a Canadian MAI treatment study in which rifabutin was given in combination with clarithromycin and ethambutol developed uveitis - inflammation of the middle coat around the eye. British doctors also noted cases in people with HIV who had recently started to take rifabutin. All the cases have been successfully treated, usually with steroid preparations applied to the eye to reduce the inflammation and, occasionally, with antibiotics and/or drugs to dilate the iris. The consensus seems to be that the uveitis is a direct toxicity caused by rifabutin, because the risk seems to increase with higher doses or when rifabutin is used in combination with clarithromycin or fluconazole, both of which have been shown to increase blood levels of rifabutin. Two cases of uveitis were seen in early dose-escalating studies designed to find out the maximum safe dose of rifabutin. However, some specialists prefer the theory that the uveitis is caused by an infection. Drug interactions Rifabutin increases levels of liver enzymes, which can affect the metabolism of a number of drugs including oral contraceptives, warfarin, phenytoin, methadone and AZT. People taking rifabutin should be closely monitored for evidence of drug interactions. Taking the anti-fungal drug fluconazole at the same time as rifabutin increases blood levels of rifabutin and may be associated with an increased risk of rifabutin side-effects. Clarithromycin levels are reduced by greater than 50% if a person starts taking rifabutin after they have begun taking clarithromycin. However, no interaction is seen if clarithromycin is started after rifabutin. People taking rifabutin, especially those who are also taking clarithromycin or fluconazole, are advised to be alert for symptoms of inflammation such as change in vision e.g. blurring or discomfort in bright light, floating spots in your A-Z OF TREATMENTS 187 [Page 188](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/194?q1=directories) line of sight or redness or pain in the eye(s). If you think you have developed any of these problems, contact your doctor or an ophthalmologist promptly. Ask your doctor whether you should stop taking rifabutin, or reduce the dose, or continuing taking rifabutin while having the uveitis treated. Key research Siegal reported that in an early dose-escalation of rifabutin, two participants developed uveitis at doses of 1200 and 1800 mg/day. Toma reported on the incidence of uveitis in a Canadian MAI trial in which one treatment arm including rifabutin (600 mg/day). 23 of 62 people randomised to this arm prior to November 1993 developed uveitis (mean time to onset 65 days). Six cases were unilateral and 17 bilateral. Kaplan-Meier curve indicated incidence rates of 4%, 24%, 35% and 43% at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks respectively. The only important risk factor was weight; the risk doubled for a weight decrease of 9 kg. All patients but one were treated with topical corticosteroids. Median time to resolution was 42 days. After a review of the cases by an independent ophthalmologist, the Safety and Efficacy Review Committee recommended that people who had developed rifabutin should stop taking the drug, and the dose used in the trial should be reduced from 600 mg/day to 300 mg/day. Since this dose reduction, no new cases of uveitis have occurred during 43 patient-months of follow-up. Frank reported two further cases of rifabutin-associated uveitis (600 mg/day), which resolved on treatment with topical prednisone and scopolamine. Narang (1992) reported that coadministration of rifabutin and AZT resulted in a one-third reduction in AZT time-concentration ('area under the curve) levels. Trapnell reported that a daily dose of 200 mg fluconazole increases the systemic levels of rifabutin by approximately 80%. Narang (1993) reported that in the two trials of rifabutin as prophylaxis against MAI, rifabutin recipients who were also receiving fluconazole were significantly less likely to develop MAI bacteraemia than rifabutin recipeinst who did not receive concomitant fluconazole or placebo recipients with or without fluconazole (5.9% versus 10.9% versus 17% respectively).

SRifampicin Rifampicin is an approved anti-mycobacterial drug that is a standard component of combination regimes for treating of tuberculosis. It is also being studied in combinations as a treatment for MAI. Side-effects can include rash, fever, gastro-intestinal distress and jaundice. Orange discoloration of body fluids such as spit and urine also occurs. Rifampicin dramatically reduces blood levels of the anti-protozoal drug atovaquone which may be used to treat PCP or, experimentally, for other opportunistic infections. Levels of rifampin may be reduced in people who are also taking ketoconazole. Rifampicin is a generic (non-brandname) product; it is known as rifampin is the USA. It is also manufactured by Merrell under the tradename Rifadin, and by Ciba under the tradename Rimactane. A number of tablets that contain rifampicin in combination with other anti-tuberculosis drugs are also on the market. SRo 24-7429 Ro 24-7429 is a drug related to valium which is thought to inhibit the action of an HIV gene called tat. The HIV tat gene produces a protein (called Tat) which greatly increases the growth efficiency of the virus; when that tat gene is inhibited in the test-tube, HIV essentially ceases to produce new virus or infect other cells. Researchers therefore believe that drugs that block this gene product may be effective treatments for people with HIV. Drugs like AZT which act as inhibitors of reverse transcriptase are only effective in acutely-infected cells; that is, they prevent the establishment of a persistent or chronic infection in previously uninfected cells. However, they have no effect on the production of new virus particles by cells with an already established infection with HIV. There is good evidence that much of the damage of AIDS is caused by reservoirs of the virus in chronically infected cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells in the skin and other cells. When infected with HIV, these cells may produce toxic substances such as the viral protein gpl 20, or inappropriate amounts of chemical 'messengers' called cytokines. An effective tat-inhibiting drug should prevent the production of viral particles and hence of new virus particles in these cells too, stopping the development of toxic substances, although it would not kill the virus and so would have to be taken indefinitely. There is also evidence that the Tat protein stimulates the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma cells; tat-inhibitors may therefore also help people with KS. Tat may also be implicated in the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Preliminary tests have suggested that it may be more difficult for HIV to develop resistance to an' anti-tat drug in the same way it can become resistant to drugs like AZT, ddl and non-nucleoside anti-virals such as L-661. This may be because a mutation which could get around the drug's effect could well be lethal to the virus. Ro 24-7429 is the only TAT inhibitor to have progressed to human trials. It was developed by Roche Products Ltd. Current use Test-tube studies produced promising results; Ro 24-7429 was active against a wide range of HIV strains, including AZT-resistant virus. HIV strains that were resistant to the drug did not develop despite over 2 years of repeated exposure to the drug. However, in the first human study of Ro 24-7429, no antiviral effects were seen at doses up to 300 mg/day. At higher doses the drug accumulates in the body and causes unacceptable side-effects. In August 1993 Roche announced that it was therefore abandoning the development of Ro 24-7429. More recent research showed that in the test-tube the effects of Ro 24-7429 were greatly enhanced when used in combination with oxpentifylline. 188 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 189](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/195?q1=directories) Current developments Enthusiasm for tat inhibitors has waned in the light of the latest research presented at the 9th International Conference on AIDS in Berlin in 1993. This suggested that the tat protein may not in fact be essential for HIV replication. Key research Lietman reported the results of a double-blind placebo-controlled dose-escalating safety and pharmacokinetics study of Ro 24-7429 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV-positive men. Patients were randomized into three groups; 6 patients in each group received active drug and 3 received placebo. Patients received Ro 24-7429 15, 50 or 150 mg every 6 hours for 5 days. Nonlinear pharmacokinetics were observed at these doses. The apparent half life ranged from 3.6 to 6.8 hours. Discoloured urine was observed in the patients receiving Ro 24-7429; no other adverse reactions attributable to the drug were observed. Haubrich enrolled 96 participants with CD4 counts between 50-500 in a study comparing three doses of Ro 24-7429 (75 mg/day, 150 mg/day or 300 mg/day) to standard dose AZT or ddl (ACTG 213). After 12 weeks the study was terminated due to lack of antiviral activity of Ro 24-7429 at the doses studied, as reflected in falling CD4 count and increasing p24 antigen. Roche consequently discontinued the development of Ro 24-7429. Hsu reported that after 2 years of repeated weekly passage of HIV in fresh CEM cells in the presence of Ro 24-7429, the virus did not develop resistance to the drug. Serious side-effects (anorexia and malaise) were observed in some female monkeys receiving oral Ro 24-7429. Biswas reported that in vitro the combination of 24-7429 and oxpentifylline was synergistic, with maximal HIV inhibitory effects seen at concentrations low enough to avoid cytotoxicity.

Cell type-specific anti-human type I activity of the Antimicrobial Agents a protease inhibitor - drugs to which L-735,524, A-74704, A-77003 and A-80987 also These inhibiting HIV's protease enzyme. Protease (or proteinase) is the name of the enzyme that HIV uses when it replicates within a cell to break up large viral proteins into smaller ones from which new virus particles can be made. Protease inhibitors have been shown to slow down the replication of HIV in the test-tube, and to be active against both acutely and chronically infected cells. Because HIV protease is only created by infected cells and has no normal function in the body, drugs that act specifically against it are unlikely to harm normal cells. Saquinavir is manufactured by Roche Products Ltd. It is was previously known by the codename Ro 31-8959, and will be marketed under the tradename Invirase. Current use Saquinavir is an unlicensed, experimental drug. It is the protease inhibitor which is most advanced in human trials. In a French study in people with CD4 counts between 50 and 250 who had previously taken AZT, a 600 mg/day dose of saquinavir produced a modest CD4 increase which peaked during the first four weeks. Virological data suggested that the drug may have reduced the amount of HIV in the blood. A study at St Mary's Hospital in London enrolled people with minor or no symptoms, CD4 counts below 500 and no prior use of AZT. A similar short term CD4 increase was seen at a dose of 600 mg/day. No consistent effect on levels of HIV in blood cells was seen using an experimental test. No side-effects were seen in either of these trial. Although these results are promising, none of these trials provides any information on the effects of the protease inhibitor on clinical events such as HIV-related symptoms, opportunistic infections or survival. Further trials are now underway. Use in combinations An American study (ACTG 229) tested the triple-drug combination of AZT, ddC and saquinavir, compared with the two-drug combinations of AZT plus ddC or AZT plus saquinavir. The triple combination produced greater and longer-lasting increases in CD4 count than the two-drug regimes, and had a greater effect on levels of HIV in the blood. There were no side-effects that were clearly due to saquinavir. An Italian trial tested saquinavir in combination with AZT. It recruited participants who had CD4 counts below 300 and had not taken AZT before. They were randomly allocated to receive 16 weeks' treatment with either AZT alone, saquinavir alone or combination therapy with AZT plus a low, a medium or a high dose of saquinavir. There were very few side-effects which seem to have been caused by the protease inhibitor. In terms of their effects on CD4 count, the AZT alone arm and the saquinavir alone arm were very similar. Better results were seen with the medium and higher dose combinations of saquinavir and AZT, which resulted in CD4 count increases of between 50 and 75, which were sustained throughout the study. At the 10th International Conference on AIDS in 1994, Dr David Barry, Wellcomes Group Director of Research, Development and Medical Affairs, reported that in vitro the triple-drug combination of AZT, ddl and saquinavir produced complete or near complete inhibition of HIV replication in laboratory cell-lines at concentrations of drug easily obtainable in the body. Resistance The development of HIV strains that are resistant to saquinavir was observed in the three European studies of saquinavir alone or in combination with AZT reported above. Six out of 16 people receiving saquinavir monotherapy developed saquinavir-resistant strains. However, only one out of 15 who took saquinavir in combination with AZT developed resistance, although six of them did develop resistance against AZT. Getting it Several British trial centres are currently taking part in an international trial of saquinavir. A-Z OF TREATMENTS 189 [Page 190](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/196?q1=directories) Key research Craig reported that saquinavir prevented the maturation of HIV in stimulated U1 cells, a chronically infected promonocytic cell line. Inhibition of both the morphological maturation of virions and the enzymic processing of gag polyprotein (p56) to produce capsid protein p24 was demonstrated at nanomolar concentrations of the compound, with an IC5s range between 0.5-6.0 Nm. Otto and Patterson reported on the isolation of HIV variants with reduced in vitro sensitivity to C-2 symmetrical inhibitors of HIV protease. Dormont enrolled 61 people with advanced HIV disease (CD4 counts below 250) previously treated with AZT in a Phase 1/11 trial comparing three doses of saquinavir monotherapy (75 mg, 200 mg and 600 mg three times a day). Treatment was well tolerated. At week 16 CD4 response showed a dose response which peaked at 4 weeks and favoured the top dose. p24 antigen levels increased in recipients of the 75 mg and 200 mg doses, but a sustained fall was observed at 600 mg. Kitchen treated 44 evaluable people with minor or no symptoms, no prior therapy and a CD4 count below 500 with one of four doses of saquinavir (25, 75, 200 or 600 mg three times a day). Treatment was well tolerated; only one adverse event (a mild headache in a 200 mg/day recipient) classified as possible related to study drug was observed. A trend towards a dose-related transient CD4 response was observed, favouring the 600 mg dose. The median maximum CD4 count change from baseline in the 600 mg group was 103.5, occurring on average at week 6. For all doses the maximum increase in CD4 count was generally seen in the first 6 weeks. The 600 mg group was the only group whose CD4 count increased on average over the 16-week period (36 cells). Only 4 participants had measurable p24 antigenaemia at baseline, thus changes in this parameter could not be assessed. Plasma viraemia was detectable in only 19% of participants at baseline. Cellular viraemia was detectable and quantifiable in 91% at baseline. In the majority of participants at all dose levels there was no significant change in cellular viraemia. Vella enrolled 92 people with advanced HIV disease (CD4 counts below 300) and no prior treatment in a 16 week comparison of saquinavir monotherapy (600 mg three times daily), AZT monotherapy (200 mg three times daily) or combination therapy with saquinavir (75 mg, 200 mg or 600 mg three times daily) plus AZT (200 mg three times daily). Participants median CD4 count was 191. Randomisation was stratified by p24 antigen levels (above or below 50 pg/ml). Saquinavir was well tolerated in combination with AZT, with only a moderate fever in one participant considered remotely related to saquinavir treatment. Protease inhibitor monotherapy had a comparable effect to AZT monotherapy measured by an initial rise in CD4 count and reduction in viral load. Combination therapy resulted in higher and more sustained CD4 responses during the first 16 weeks of treatment than seen with either drug alone in monotherapy. The largest median maximum CD4 count change from baseline was 147, occurring at week 8 in the AZT/saquinavir (600 mg) combination arm. 80 participants continued to receive their assigned treatment for blinded monthly extension periods beyond week 16. CD4 change analysis at week 24 showed that the superior response in the AZT/saquinavir (600 mg) arm was sustained during this extension period. There was a decline in p24 antigen levels in all 5 treatment arms in participants with baseline levels above 50 pg/ml. 16/55 participants with detectable plasma viraemia at baseline had a greater than 1 log reduction maintained for over 4 weeks; 7 of thesel 6 were in the AZT/saquinavir (600 mg) arm. Collier enrolled 297 evaluable HIV-positive individuals who had received at least 4 months prior AZT therapy (mean duration 843 days) and who had CD4 cell counts between 50-300 in ACTG 229, a randomised, double-blind, 24-week Phase II study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the triple combination of AZT (600 mg/day), ddC (2.25 mg/day) and saquinavir (1800 mg/day), the double combination of AZT plus saquinavir or the double combination of AZT plus ddC.The rate of CD4 increase was greater in participants receiving the triple combination than that of those receiving AZT plus ddC (but not the AZT plus saquinavir group), and the normalized area under the CD4 curve was greater on the triple combination than either double combination. At 24 weeks, 31% of triple combination recipients had CD4 counts that had returned to baseline, compared to 37% of the AZT plus saquinavir group and 55% of the AZT plus ddC group. PBMC co-culture and preliminary analysis of quantitative plasma HIV RNA demonstrated that the triple combination produced significantly greater reductions in viral burden than either of the other arms. 12 participants developed a new AIDS-defining event or died during the study; one in the triple combination group, seven in the AZT plus saquinavir group and four in the AZT plus ddC arm. There was no significant difference in the proportion of each group who experienced grade 3 or 4 clinical or laboratory toxicities (31%, 40% and 37%, respectively). Johnson tested saquinavir regimens with AZT, ddC or recombinant interferon-alpha A (rlFN-alpha A) against HIV-1 replication in vitro. Additive to synergistic interactions were seen with 7.5-30 nM saquinavir and 0.005-0.02 pM AZT (for the AZT-sensitive HIV isolate), 0.25-1.0 pM AZT (for the AZT-resistant HIV isolate), 0.025-0.1 pM ddC and 8-32 units/mL rlFN-alpha A, without additive toxicity.

SSC-55389A SC-55389A is the codename for a protease inhibitor being developed by the company Searle. It a second generation compound, improving on an earlier candidate protease inhibitor codenamed SC-52151 which was abandoned after it failed to show anti-HIV activity in Phase II studies. SC-52151 is thought to have failed because it was binds to a protein in the blood and is then removed from the circulation by the liver. SC-55389A has greater bioavailability, longer half-life and less protein binding than SC-52151. References Bryant M et al.

Preliminary evidence suggests that cyclosporin may have some benefits for people with HIIV, possibly because it inhibits HIV replication. Unlike cyclosporin, SDZ 811 is not immunosuppressive, but it has also been shown to have inhibitory effects against both laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV.

Selenium is an essential building block for glutathione and is crucial in preserving healthy cells. Low levels of selenium have been observed in a number of studies of HIV positive people. Although only tiny quantities of selenium are needed, and can be found in a wide range of foods such as onions, garlic, broccoli, fish, wholegrains and cabbage, deficiency is usually the result of very low levels of selenium in the soil in which plants grow rather than poor diet. A good multivitamin should contain adequate quantities of selenium to ensure that nutrititional needs are met. Large quantities (above 750 micrograms) may cause immune suppression and the loss of hair, as well as affecting the skin, nervous system and teeth. Good food sources of selenium are broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, celery, cucumbers, onions, garlic, grains and radishes, dependent on the selenium content of the soil in which they grow. * Sorivudine Sorivudine is an experimental oral antiviral drug. It belongs to the nucleoside analogue class. In the test-tube it is active against herpes simplex and varicella zoster viruses. It is also known as BV-araU or brovavir, or by the tradename Usevir. The drug was licensed in Japan as treatment for zoster but withdrawn following 3 deaths in people also using fluorouracil. Apart from this interaction, however, it is considered to be a very safe drug, with no more side-effects than the widely used anti-herpes drug acyclovir. It is being tested as a treatment for herpes infections that are resistant to acyclovir. Sorivudine was discovered by Japanese company Yamasa Shoyu, which licensed worldwide marketing rights to Bristol-Myers Squibb. References Anonymous. Usevir pulled as deaths follow launch. Marketletter, 25th October, 1993. * SP-303T SP-303T is an experimental antiviral drug which is active against a broad range of viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, parainfluenza (PIV) types 1 and 3, hepatitis A virus and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. It is being studied is in the USA in the form of a cream for treating acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus infection. * SP-PG SP-PG is intravenous drug which inhibits angiogenesis (blood-vessel formation). SP-PG inhibits the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma spindle cells in mice. A clinical trial of SP-PG for Kaposi's sarcoma is underway in the USA. No toxicity information is available. * Sparfloxacin Sparfloxacin is an experimental antibiotic that belongs to the 4-quinolone class of drugs that also includes ciprofloxacin. In test-tube studies it is synergistic with ethambutol and rifampin against MAI organisms. References Rastogi N et al. Antimycobacterial spectrum of sparfloxacin and its activities alone and in association with other drugs against Mycobacterium avium complex growing extracellularly and intracellularly in murine and macrophages. Antimicrobial Agents & Chemotherapy 1991. * Stavudine Like AZT, ddl and ddC, stavudine is a modified form of one of the building blocks of DNA (known as nucleosides). When HIV replicates in the presence of these nucleoside analogue drugs, the virus' reverse transcriptase enzyme incorporates the drug in the place of a normal nucleoside in the growing DNA strand. This prevents the proper assembly of viral genetic material and halts viral replication. Stavudine is manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb. It is also known by the codename d4T or by its tradename Zerit. Current use In Britain stavudine is an unlicensed, experimental drug, although it has been licensed in the USA for the treatment of adults who are intolerant of other approved anti-HIV drugs or are experiencing disease progression despite using them. Trials to date have found evidence of good antiviral activity and increases in CD4 counts, but there is not yet any evidence that the drug can affect the clinical course of HIV infection, such as preventing or delaying symptoms or prolonging survival. Larger human trials are now taking place. The drugs major side-effect is peripheral neuropathy. The risk of neuropathy increases at higher doses; in phase II studies it occurred in 1 2%, 1 1% and 65% of participants receiving 0.1, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg/day respectively. In the US parallel track programme which supplied stavudine to people with advanced HIV disease who were intolerant of other therapies, neuropathy occurred in 15% and 21% of people receiving 20 mg twice daily and 40 mg twice daily respectively. This led to the discontinuation of the 40 mg dose arm. In the phase III study comparing stavudine with AZT, more side-effects were seen in the AZT arm, especially nausea, anaemia and lowered white blood cell counts. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of people who developed neuropathy in each treatment group. A-Z OF TREATMENTS 191 [Page 192](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/198?q1=directories) Other less common toxicities of stavudine include elevated liver-function tests, headaches, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, pancreatitis (which can be fatal), sepsis, chills and fevers, dehydration and nausea. These toxicities are usually reversible on stopping the drug. There have also been anecdotal reports of sleep disorders, mania and skin rashes. Stavudine is not an attractive candidate drug for use in combination antiviral therapy as it is antagonistic with AZT. Getting it Stavudine is available through an expanded access scheme in the UK, in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two different doses. This scheme is open to people who have failed to respond to or are intolerant of AZT and ddl, or who cannot take ddl for other reasons. Key research Stavudine has been licensed in the US for the treatment of people with advanced HIV infection who are intolerant to or failing on other anti-retroviral drugs. In support of their application for approval, the manufacturer presented data from an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This compares d4T (40 mg twice daily) and AZT in people with CD4 counts between 50 and 500 and at least six months of prior AZT therapy. 882 participants have been randomized, and the main endpoints are disease progression, survival, and a 50% drop in CD4 count from baseline. The interim analysis focussed on a sub-group of 359 people who had completed at least 4 months of therapy; their median CD4 count was about 250 at baseline, and their median time on prior AZT was 80 weeks. A mean rise of about 20 was observed in the stavudine group, while slight declines were observed in the AZT group. The CD4 count in the stavudine group returned to baseline within 20 weeks. Weight gain and reductions in p24 antigenaemia were also observed in the d4T group. The clinical data remain blinded, and none were presented. Dudley studied the pharmacokinetics of stavudine in people with ARC or AIDS enrolled in a dose-ranging phase 1/11 study. Stavudine absorption was rapid, with mean peak concentrations of 1.2-4.2 mg/L over the four dose levels studied. 34-41% of an oral dose was excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. The mean values for plasma elimination half-life ranged from 1 to 1.6 hours. The absolute bioavailability of a 4 mg/kg oral dose exceeded 80%. Dunkle analysed data on 264 participants in 6 clinical trials of stavudine, administered orally in 2, 3 and 4 daily doses totalling 0.1 to 12.0 mg/kg/day. Bioavailability was greater than 85%. The median duration of improvement in CD4 counts in patients who had a 50% increase on therapy exceeded 54 weeks. At doses of less than 2.0 mg/kg/day, 29% experienced some dose modification and 16% discontinued during the first 6 months of therapy. The major dose-limiting toxicity was peripheral neuropathy (6/74 at 0.5 mg/kg/day, 4/23 at 1.0 mg/kg/day, 15/67 at 2.0 mg/kg/day; 14 later resumed d4T therapy). Browne enrolled 36 participants with ARC or AIDS and CD4 counts ranging from 15 to 570 in a phase I trial of stavudine. Doses ranging from 0.5 to 12 mg/kg/day were administered for 4 to 71 weeks. Peripheral neuropathy was a dose-limiting toxicity in 55%, occurring at all but the two lowest doses. Most participants experienced marked clinical improvement, stabilisation or increase in CD4 count and resolution of p24 antigenaemia. Anderson (1992) reported that 10 weeks' treatment with stavudine at 2 mg/kg/day resulted in decreases in PBMC viral titres, in a study of 47 HIV-positive people with CD4 counts below 500. Squires enrolled 40 people with AIDS/ARC in ACTG 089, a phase 1/11 dose de-escalation trial of stavudine. Patients receive stavudine (2 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, or 0.5 mg/kg) by mouth twice a day until the minimum effective dose is achieved. Dose-related peripheral neuropathy has been observed, but only rarely at doses lower than 2 mg/kg; resolution of neuropathy occurs in 90% of patients within 2-4 weeks. At doses of 1 mg/kg and above p24 antigen was reduced by more than 50% in 85-100% of patients; CD4 count increases were larger than those seen with AZT in ACTG 016 and were sustained above baseline for longer. CD4 count increases of 25% have been seen in over 50% of patients receiving doses of 2 mg/kg and above and in 30% of patients receiving lower doses. Petersen treated 105 HIV-positive people with CD4 counts below 500 with stavudine (0.1, 0.5 or 2 mg/kg/day). The 2 mg/kg/day dose produced sustained 25% increases in CD4 cells in 32% of participants and 50% decreases in p24 antigen in 60%. Conant treated 96 people who had discontinued other antiretroviral therapies with stavudine. 56 (58.3%) experienced an adverse event which led 23 to discontinue therapy. The majority of those experiencing an adverse event suffered peripheral neuropathy (50%) and insomnia, anxiety and/or acute panic (35.7%). of 71 evaluable people, 23 (32.4%) experienced a CD4 count increase. Skowron administered stavudine (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg/day) to 20 people with advanced HIV infection (median CD4 count 38) who were haematologically intolerant to AZT. By 18 weeks, 5/17 (295) had a 25% increase in CD4 count sustained for at least 4 weeks and 4/7 (57%) p24 antigenaemic participants had a sustained 50% fall in p24 antigen. Stavudine was well-tolerated with no evidence of myelosuppression. Brett-Smith treated 8 people with CD4 counts below 500 who were intolerant to AZT with stavudine (0.1, 0.5 or 2 mg/kg/day). Preliminary results from quantitative HIV culture suggested that d4T may reduce viraemia to undetectable levels in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma within 4-10 weeks, with the most pronounced effect at 2 mg/kg/day. Anderson (1993) reported that in the USA expanded-access programme, adverse events reported (per 100 person years) include severe neuropathy (20/63), diarrhoea (12), sepsis (3) chills/fever (13), abdominal pain (11), nausea/vomiting (15), pancreatitis (4), headache (9), and dehydration (9). Kline has enrolled 18 children with vertically acquired HIV infection in a phase I open, dose-ranging (0.1 25-2 mg/kg/day) study of stavudine. 13 were symptomatic and 5 were asymptomatic with low CD4 counts. 12 had a history of prior AZT use. Preliminary results found that the drug has been well-tolerated with no adverse clinical or laboratory events. Over the first 12 weeks of therapy CD4 counts or percentages increased in individuals initially assigned to a dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg/day but not at lower doses. Serum p24 antigen has remained stable or decreased in most participants. References Anderson RE et al.

SStreptomycin Streptomycin was the first effective anti-tuberculosis drug to be discovered. It is now rarely used for treating TB, except in the case of strains that have developed resistance to the drugs that are now usually used. Side-effects from streptomycin can include allergic reactions, ear problems, kidney damage and pain at the injection site (it is administered by intramuscular injection). It should only be used with great care in people with kidney impairment. 192 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 193](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/199?q1=directories) * Sulphadiazine Sulphadiazine is an approved antibiotic for treating meningococcal meningitis. For people with HIV it is most commonly used in combination with pyriemthamine for treating PCP or toxoplasmosis. It is the drug which causes the highest rate of allergic skin reactions; 20% of recipients can expect significant side-effects during a course of treatment. References Coopman SA et al. Cutaneous disease and drug reactions in HIV infection. NEJM 328(23): 670-1674, 1993. * Sulphamethoxazole Sulphamethoxazole is one of the two drugs that make up co-trimoxazole, the other being trimethoprim. Co-trimoxazole is a first-line therapy for the prevention and treatment of PCP. Sulphamethoxazole is not used as a treatment on its own. * Thalidomide Thalidomide was launched in Europe in 1958, as a treatment for morning sickness in pregnant women. Tests in animals had failed to find any significant side-effects; indeed, the drug was so non-toxic that researchers were unable to identify a dose which killed the animals. However, thalidomide was withdrawn from the market after it was demonstrated in 1960 that the drug caused birth defects in a proportion of the children of pregnant women who had taken the drug. In Britain, thalidomide was banned in 1961; safety concerns meant that it was never marketed in the USA at all. Since then, thalidomide has only been available to doctors under the 'named patient basis' prescribing rules. These allow a doctor to prescribe an unlicensed medicine on an individual basis if they have evidence to suggest that it will be effective. Thalidomide is able to suppress certain parts of the immune system. Some researchers have suggested that it stimulates the production of 'suppressor' T-cells which can shut down the immune systems response to foreign organisms. However, its main immunosuppressive effect seems to be against a cytokine (a natural chemical used to pass signals between human cells) called tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Several research teams have shown that TNF-alpha can encourage HIV to replicate in infected lymphocytes. It is also theorised that the cytokine may be one of the causes of weight loss and wasting experienced by some HIV-positive people. This is why researchers are interested in evaluating the effects of drugs which inhibit TNF-alpha, such as thalidomide. Thalidomide is manufactured by Penn Pharmaceuticals. Current use Thalidomide has been used experimentally to treat a number of auto-immune conditions in which the immune system seems to attack the body's own cells, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and graft-versus-disease. It has also been used with some success to treat certain complications of leprosy as well as diseases involving ulceration, such as Bechet's syndrome. In 1984 the Department of Health's independent Committee on Safety on Medicines specifically reviewed the limited use of thalidomide on a named patient basis for these conditions and concluded that it was appropriate. Several different studies have suggsted that thalidomide is an effective treatment for oral aphthous ulcers associated with HIV infection. Trials investigating the anti-HIV or immune modulating effects of thalidomide are underway in the UK and the USA. Even today no-one knows precisely how thalidomide works. It is broken down in the body into up to 50 different chemicals, whose effects are generally unknown. Side-effects Thalidomide clearly is not safe for pregnant women to take, because of the risk to their unborn baby. Even if a woman says that she is not practising heterosexual sex, doctors may refuse to treat her with thalidomide unless she is taking oral contraceptives to make certain that she does not become pregnant. Sometimes they may perform blood tests to ensure that contraception is being used. Thalidomide can also cause peripheral neuropathy painful damage to the nerves in the hands and feet. This side-effect can also be caused by the anti-HIV drugs ddl and ddC, although in their case the neuropathy tends to get better again quite quickly if the treatment is stopped. Unfortunately, thalidomide-related neuropathy seems to be irreversible and the damage remains even after the individual stops taking thalidomide. A unique allergic reaction to thalidomide has been seen in some people with HIV. Williams at the Middlesex Hospital in London reported that the drug was an effective treatment for ulcers in 7 people with AIDS, but caused a widespread rash in three and two of them also developed fever and an irregular heartbeat. It is the danger of irreversible peripheral neuropathy that makes most doctors very wary about using thalidomide. In most cases there are alternative drugs available which have the same apparent effects as thalidomide but which do not risk this side-effect. Other side-effects of thalidomide include drowsiness and dry mouth. Getting it Doctors can obtain thalidomide as a treatment for ulcers for prescribing on a named patient basis. A trial of thalidomide as an immune modulator in early HIV infection is taking place at the Kobler Centre in London. Key research Makonkawkeyoon reported that thalidomide selectively inhibits the production of TNF-alpha by blood cells. In laboratory tests HIV-infected cells started to produce new HIV particles when TNF-alpha was added. When these cells were treated with thalidomide, HIV replication was significantly reduced in monocytes the cells which mature into macrophages. These findings led the researchers to suggest that thalidomide could be a useful treatment for people with HIV by suppressing viral replication and so decreasing the amount of HIV in the body, as well as alleviating symptoms A-Z OF TREATMENTS 193 [Page 194](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/200?q1=directories) caused by TNF-alpha itself, such as fever, malaise, muscle weakness and wasting. Williams treated 8 people with AIDS and severe oropharyngeal aphthous ulceration with thalidomide (200 mg/day in 7 patients and 100 mg/day in 1). Treatment led to rapid relief of pain with partial or complete healing in 7. In 1 person the dose was halved (100 mg) after 3 days because of drowsiness. In a further 3 individuals thalidomide was stopped early (six to twelve days) because of a widespread erythematous macular rash. Rechallenge was undertaken in 2 of these 3 because of recurrence of pain and ulceration. Hypersensitivity reactions (fever, rash, tachycardia) developed again in both people within a few hours of taking a single 100 mg dose of thalidomide. 1 patient became hypotensive and required colloid infusion and hydrocortisone. Both allergic reactions resolved within 24 hours. Gunzler (1989) argued that the beneficial effects of the thalidomide on a variety of disorders involving the immune system have been established, and that comparison of symptoms and immunologic abnormalities of such diseases with AIDS as well as experimentally obtained results suggest that thalidomide may be a useful agent suppressing autoimmune reactions initiated by HIV. Gunzler (1992) reviewed important chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of thalidomide. Because the mechanism of the immunomodulatory effect of thalidomide is unknown, the possibility that the administration of this compound will accelerate the deterioration of the immunological status of people with HIV cannot be excluded. Clinical evidence suggests that thalidomide may aggravate the condition of patients with preexisting peripheral neuropathy. Hypersensitivity reactions to thalidomide may occur more frequently in people with HIV than in other patient groups. Because of the teratogenic activity of thalidomide, reliable contraception must be provided to female patients of childbearing age. Before the introduction of thalidomide therapy to an individual with HIV presenting with oral ulcers, a fungal or viral origin of the lesions should be excluded. Thalidomide should not be used in patients with preexisting HIV-related peripheral polyneuropathy, polyradiculopathy or encephalopathy. In patients experiencing a complete remission, the discontinuation of thalidomide treatment and its reintroduction in the case of a relapse are preferable to maintenance therapy.

The thymus is the organ responsible for the development and regulation of T cell immunity in both infants and adult, and these substances seem to play a key role in its functioning. They affect the expression of various cytokine receptors on T-cells and induce the secretion of interleukin-2, alpha interferon and gamma interferon when the immune system is challenged. Researchers are investigating whether these thymic peptides can be used to correct some of the immune abnormalities that occur in HIV infection. Examples of thymic peptides include thymomodulin, thymostimulin, thymopentin (also known thymic humoral factor (THF). Current use Thymic peptides are unlicensed, experimental drugs. Two phase II studies of thymopentin found that the asymptomatic people who took the drug were significantly less likely to develop new constitutional symptoms than people given placebo. Other studies have produced suggestions that thymopentin or THF may improve immune responses and CD4 count, but these have been too small to reach clear-cut conclusions. No beneficial effects have been reported from thymostimulin in small controlled studies. Respiratory congestion has been reported as a side-effect by some people taking thymopentin. Use in combinations A trial in which 353 asymptomatic people received either AZT alone or AZT plus thymopentin found that the combination recipients were significantly less likely to experience disease progression than those taking AZT monotherapy. This effect was particularly pronounced among those who were most likely to experience progression (CD4 counts below 400 and at least 6 months' prior use of AZT). Getting it Thymic peptides are not undergoing trials in Britain. Key research Thymopentin is a biologically active synthetic pentapeptide that corresponds to the active site of the thymic hormone, thymopoietin. In vitro, thymopentin regulates the function of peripheral T cells, acting via a cyclic GMP-linked cell surface receptor and enhances T-cell functions by increasing lymphokine production. Conant (1992) conducted two phase II double-blind placebo-controlled studies of thymopentin involving 91 HIV-infected people. In both studies patients received thymopentin (50 mg subcutaneously three times weekly) or placebo. In the first study, participants were treated for 24 weeks, compared to 52 weeks in the second study. Participants were stratified at entry by disease status (52 asymptomatic and 39 symptomatic). 26/52 asymptomatic and 20/39 symptomatic people received thymopentin. None the 26 thymopentin-treated asymptomatic individuals developed new constitutional symptoms compared to 3/24 placebo recipients. Thymopentin did not prevent the development of or reduce the incidence of candidiasis, oral hairy leucoplakia, or herpes zoster in asymptomatic participants. Four symptomatic individuals progressed to AIDS (two on thymopentin and 2 on placebo). Conant (1993) enrolled 353 asymptomatic AZT-treated persons with CD4 counts between 200-500 in a placebo-controlled trial of thymopentin (50 mg) or placebo subcutaneously three times a week along with AZT (300-600 mg/day). After a median follow-up of 339 days, 4/173 (2.3%) recipients of thymopentin plus AZT had progressed to ARC, AIDS or death compared to 16/179 (8.9%) people who received AZT alone. In the stratum with the highest rate of progression (CD4 below 400 and at least 6 months prior AZT at baseline) 2 events occurred in the thymopentin plus AZT group versus 13 in the AZT alone group. Goldstein reported follow-up to 80 weeks of participants in the above trial. Among participants with more than 6 months prior AZT at baseline, thymopentin delayed disease progression to both AIDS or death, and to ARC, AIDS or death. The low rate of progression among participants with less than 6 months prior AZT at baseline meant that no differences between thymopentin or placebo could be observed. Thompson stratified 45 HIV-infected individuals into asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic groups and randomly assigned them to receive either thymopentin (50 mg) or placebo 3 times per week for 52 weeks. 4 clinical events occurred in the study, 3 in the placebo group (1 to AIDS and 2 to constitutional symptoms) and 1 in the thymopentin group (1 to AIDS). Too few patients were enrolled to detect significant differences in disease progression. Thymopentin recipients maintained CD4 cells and CD4 percentage at or above entry values, whereas these parameters decreased in the placebo group. Silvestris treated 29 individuals with lymphadenopathy with thymopentin (59 mg 3 times a week) for 1 year. 13 participants had CD4 count increases to 500 after 4 months and stayed at that level, while CD8 counts fell. Mitogen responses of T and B cells improved. There was no clear correlation between these markers and reduction in clinical symptoms. Thymomodulin is a calf thymus acid lysate. Valesini treated 15 HIV-positive people with thymomodulin syrup (60 mg/day) for 50 days. Clinical benefits including resolution of oral candida and lymphadenopathy were observed. No side-effects were seen. Thymostimulin (TP-1) is prepared from a partially-purified extract of calf thymus glands. Chachoua treated 15 people with AIDS with TP-1 (1 mg/kg 194 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 195](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/201?q1=directories) for 15 days then weekly for 12 weeks) or placebo. Adverse events included pain at injection site, fever and chills, skin rash or eosinophilia. No changes in immune function were noted. Beall conducted a placebo-controlled phase I study of TP-1 (1 mg/kg/day for 14 days followed by twice-weekly injections for 6 months). No effect on clinical or laboratory measures was observed except for a transient decrease in p24 antigen in the treated group. Thymic humoral factor (THF) is a natural peptide hormone isolated from calf thymus. THF is reported to increase the number of T-lymphocytes and augment cell-mediated immunity. Kouttab enrolled 14 HIV-positive individuals with CD4 count between 100-500 in a phase I study of THF 5, 10 or 25 mg/kg/day administered intramuscularly daily on a two-week on/one week off cycle for 12 weeks. All participants were receiving AZT. Overall, an increase in mitogen responses, NK activity and DTH responses were observed. Handzel treated 15 asymptomatic men with 2 biweekly courses of THF or placebo. After 2 weeks THF-recipients had significant increases in mean CD4, CD3 and total lymphocyte counts compared to the placebo group. Shohat reported that incubation of lymphocytes from 2 HIV-positive men with THF restored the impaired helper cell activity. Garaci conducted an uncontrolled pilot study of the combination of AZT (500 mg/day), thymosin alpha 1 (1 mg subcutaneously twice weekly) and alpha interferon (2 million units intramuscularly twice weekly). 7 participants who completed one year of treatment had a significant CD4 count increase, from an average of 309 to 496.

It is being studied in the USA as a potential treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma as well as solid tumours. * Total parenteral nutrition Total parenteral nutrition is a method of supplying nutritional supplements by intravenous infusion. It is only used for people with severely compromised bowel function who are unable to meet their nutritional needs from foods or supplements taken by mouth. The procedure involves infusing a liquid nutrient preparation directly into the bloodstream through a central venous line catheter. * Trifluridine Trifluridine is an antiviral drug that is being used experimentally to treat acyclovir-resistant and foscarnet-resistant varicella zoster virus infection (shingles). Side-effects to topical treatment can include a mild burning sensation after application. Trifluridine is also known as triflourothymidine by the abbreviation TFT. In the USA it is marketed under the tradename Viroptic. = Trimethoprim Trimethoprim - sometimes abbreviated to TMP - is an approved antibiotic which is used most frequently in conjunction with sulphamethoxazole (SMX) in the form of the drug co-trimoxazole. Co-trimoxazole is a first-line therapy for the prevention and treatment of PCP. Trimethoprim in combination with dapsone is also used for PCP, but with a relatively high rate of allergic skin reactions. Trimethoprim alone has not been tested against PCP in humans, but studies in rats showed that it was unable to prevent PCP infection whereas the co-trimoxazole combination was successful. Trimethoprim is available as a generic (non-brandname) product. References Consumers Association. Co-trimoxazole, or just trimethoprim5 Drug & Therapeutics Bulletin 24(5): 17-19, 1986. Coopman SA et al. Cutaneous disease and drug reactions in HIV infection. NEJM 328(23): 670-1674, 1993. * Trimetrexate Trimetrexate is an antimicrobial drug that has been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe PCP in people who are intolerant of or do not respond to co-trimoxazole. It is also active against Toxoplasma gondii in the test-tube. Trimetrexate is administered intravenously. It must always be given with folinic acid, an approved drug that is used to protect against the side-effects of folate antagonist drugs such as trimetrexate. Cells that absorb folinic acid are A-Z OF TREATMENTS 195 [Page 196](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/202?q1=directories) protected against trimetrexate, while those that do not absorb folinic acid can be seriously damaged by trimetrexate. Since folinic acid is taken up by human cells but not by, for example, Pneumocystis carinii organisms, the combination of folinic acid with trimetrexate allows the effects of the trimetrexate to be targetted against Pneumocystis. Without folinic acid trimetrexate could cause serious or even fatal side-effects including bone marrow suppression and kidney and/or liver damage. Folinic acid treatment must be continued 72 hours past the last dose of trimetrexate. Even taken with folinic acid, trimetrexate can cause liver, kidney, gastro-intestinal and blood toxicities. AZT should be discontinued during trimetrexate treatment as both drugs can damage the bone marrow. Trimetrexate is also known as trimetrexate glucoronate. It is manufactured by US Bioscience Inc under the tradename NeuTrexin. * TSAO derivatives Like AZT, ddl and ddC, TSAO derivatives are modified forms of one of the building blocks of DNA (known as nucleosides). When HIV replicates in the presence of these nucleoside analogue drugs, the virus' reverse transcriptase enzyme incorporates the drug in the place of a normal nucleoside in the growing DNA strand. This prevents the proper assembly of viral genetic material and halts viral replication. Like the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, these drugs are active only against HIV-1 and have no effect against HIV-2 or SIV. Current use TSAO derivatives are unlicensed, experimental drugs that are still at a very early stage of development. Trials in humans have not yet begun. Key research Balzarini (1992) found that TSAO derivatives inhibited HIV-1 replication at a concentration of 0.06-0.8 pM but were not cytotoxic at a 1000-10,000-fold higher concentration. They were also effective against various other HIV-1 strains, including AZT-resistant strains, but not against HIV-2. They proved to be highly specific inhibitors of the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase function of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Balzarini (1993) found that HIV variants that were resistant to TSAO-ml Hx were also cross-resistant to the other TSAO-purine derivatives and to the TSAO-pyrimidine derivatives. Resistance was associated with a single amino acid change of Glu38-Lys. However, this resistant virus remained highly sensitive to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as nevirapine, pyridinone (L-697,661) and 1,2-oxathio le-2, (TSAO) nucleoside analogues: highly selective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 that are targeted at the viral reverse transcriptase. PNAS USA 89(10):4392-4396, 1992. Balzarini J 2', 5'-bis-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-beta-D-ribofuranosyl]-3'-spiro-5-(4-amino- 1,2-oxathio le-2,2-dioxide)-purine analogues show a resistance spectrum that is different from that of the human immunodeficiency virus type is a drug that was originally developed for sickle cell anaemia. In studies in the test-tube, in animals, in healthy humans and in people with sickle cell anaemia it has also shown immune-boosting effects, and in animal models of retroviral infections it is said to have reduced viral load. It is thought to work by stimulating T-cells. It is also known by the codename 589C80. It is now being developed by Wellcome as a treatment for people with HIV. Phase I studies were due to begin in late 1994. * U-75875 U-75875 is a protease inhibitor - the family of anti-HIV drugs to which L-735,524 and Ro 31-8959 also belong. These drugs act by inhibiting HIV's protease enzyme. Protease (or proteinase) is the name of the enzyme that HIV uses when it replicates within a cell to break up large viral proteins into smaller ones from which new virus particles can be made. Protease inhibitors have been shown to slow down the replication of HIV in the test- tube. Because HIV protease is only created by infected cells and has no normal function in the body, drugs that act specifically against it are unlikely to harm normal cells. U-75875 is manufactured by Upjohn. Current use U-75875 was produced by researchers working at NIAID laboratories, who modified the structure of another protease inhibitor, U-81749, to improve its activity. In test-tube studies, U-75875 completely blocked HIV replication and virus particles produced in the presence of the drug were immature and non-infectious, containing little or no p24 antigen and a greatly reduced amount of the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Its antiviral action was seen against both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteases. Animal studies suggests that concentrations of U-75875 higher than those necessary for anti-HIV activity in vitro can be maintained for several hours without any signs of toxicity. The action of U-75875 seems to be essentially irreversible: the anti-HIV effects were maintained even after the drug was removed from cell cultures with HIV. Human trials are now underway. Key research Ashorn found that U-75875 inhibited HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV protease activity and replication at a concentration of 3 nM and was toxic to cells at 10 pM. Virions produced in the presence of U-75875 were immature and non-infectious and contained little or no p24 core antigen and a substantially reduced amount of reverse transcriptase. The anti-HIV effect of U-75875 was sustained even after the drug was withdrawn from culture. Perno reported that U-75875 inhibits HIV replication in de-novo infected mature macrophages (IDso:0.7 pM) and in C8166 T-cells (IDso:0.03 pM). Greater than 99.9% inhibition of HIV replication was achieved by 10 iM U-75875 in macrophages and no virus production was detected up to 30 days after drug treatment. IDso of U-75875 in HIV-H9 was 0.2 pM. No cell toxicity was detected at any drug concentration tested. Virus titration shows that 10 |pM U-75875 induces greater than 5 logs decrease of virus production in HIV-infected mature macrophages. 196 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 197](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/203?q1=directories) P et al.

U-96988 U-96988 is the codename for a protease inhibitor being developed by the company Upjohn. It is currently in Phase I clinical trials. Tests in animals have shown that up to 90% of a dose taken by mouth is absorbed into the body. In the test-tube it is active against a range of HIV strains taken from infected people and is synergistic with AZT. * Valaciclovir Valaciclovir is a pro-drug of acyclovir, meaning that it is broken down into acyclovir iwthin the body. Thuis allows higher blood levels of acyclovir to be reached than is possible using the conventional tablet formulation of acyclovir. It is hoped that these high levels may have increased activity against herpes simplex, and may also be effective against CMV. An international study known as ACTG 204 is testing valaciclovir and high doses of acyclovir as CMV prophylaxis. Valaciclovir has been approved for the treatment of shingles after a study in 1141 people found that it reduced the duration of pain (post-herpetic neuralgia) by 25%, or 2 weeks, compared with acyclovir. Valaciclovir was formely known by the codename BW256U87. It is produced by Wellcome under the tradename Valtrex. Key research Jacobson conducted a phase I study of valaciclovir in two cohorts of volunteers with advanced HIV disease (CD4 counts below 150) who received valaciclovir (1000 or 2000 mg four times daily for 30 days). Only one episode of diarrhoea was considered causally related to the drug. Four participants developed neutropenia that was not clinically significant. The mean trough and peak acyclovir concentrations and the daily steady state AUC concentration-time acyclovir values were 2.5 and 8.4 pg/ml and 120 h.bg/ml respectively after the 2000 mg four times daily dose. These values are approximately five-fold greater than those achieved with acyclovir (800 mg five times daily). References Jacobson MA et al.

Antimicrobial Agents & Chemotherapy 38(7): 1534-1540, 1994. * Vesnarinone Vesnarinone is a drug that is approved in Japan as a treatment for mild to moderate heart failure. It is being studied in the USA as a treatment for HIV and Kaposi's sarcoma. Test-tube studies have found that it has some direct anti-HIV effects and also reduces levels of tumour necrosis factor, a cytokine which may be implicated in HIV disease progression and wasting syndrome. A phase I study in asymptomatic people found that it is well-tolerated. Further trials using higher doses are planned. Vesnarinone was formerly known by the codename OPC-8212. It is manufactured by Otsuka under the tradename Arkin-Z. Key research Marayuma reported that vesnarinone reduced the viral cytopathic effect of HIV-1 in acutely infected T cells in vitro (ICso = 8.55 - 15.8 pig/ml), and inhibited virus production in acutely and chronically infected macrophages. At concentrations greater than 3 pg/ml it inhibited the production of TNF-alpha from stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. Petit found that vesnarinone inhibited AIDS-KS cell proliferation in vitro at pharmacologically achievable concentrations, perhaps by inhibiting TNF and interleukin-6, which act as mitogens for AIDS-KS in culture. Mitsyasu enrolled 36 asymptomatic people in a Phase I study of vesnarinone (30, 60 or 90 mg/day for 12 weeks). Of 16 people who have completed the study at either the 30 or 60 mg/day dose levels, no significant changes in TNF levels and a modest increase in IL-6 levels were seen. No effect on viral titres (measured by HIV-RNA PCR), triglycerides, mean CD4 cell percentages or neutrophil couns were observed. References Maruyama B et al.

The treatment involves taking fibroblast cells from patients, infecting them with a genetically altered mouse virus and infusing them back into the patients. The mouse virus is unable to infect other cells, but causes the fibroblasts to produce the HIV proteins Env and Rev. The hypothesis is that this will in turn stimulate the immune system to produce immune responses against the HIV proteins that will also act against 'real HIV and HIV-infected cells. Tests in animals have shown that such treatments stimulate powerful cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CD8) responses that kill cells infected with all strains of HIV that have been tested. A phase I study found that the treatment caused no adverse effects and stimulated cytotoxic T-cell activity in three out of four asymptomatic participants. Further trials are underway. The Viagene immunotherapeutic, which does not yet have a proper name, is being developed by the Viagene company in collaboration with Green Cross of Japan. Key research Jolly enrolled 4 asymptomatic HIV-positive people with CD4 counts above 400 or a CD4 percentage above 20% in a Phase I study of the Viagene immunotherapeutic. Participants received an initial course of injections of 107 fibroblasts 3 times at 2-week intervals. Five months later, participants received a booster of 3 further injections at monthly intervals. No adverse events were observed. Increases in HIV-specific CTL activity were observed in 3/4 participants. CD4 counts remained stable in 4/4. References Jolly DJ et al.

It is used to treat HSV encephalitis; neonatal encephalitis, infections of the skin, eyes, and mouth, disseminated HSV & VZV infection with visceral involvement, and herpes zoster (shingles) due to reactivated VZV infections in immunosuppressed patients. Side-effects can include rash, reactions at the injection site, weakness and hypokalemia Vidarabine is also known as adenine arabinoside, or Ara-A. * Vinblastine Vinblastine is an intravenous anti-cancer drug derived from the periwinkle plant. It is being studied for the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoma. Side-effects include leukopenia and occasional hair loss. Vinblastine is also knwon as vinblastine sulphate. It is available as a generic (non-brandname) product. * Vincristine Vincristine is an intravenous anti-cancer drug derived from the periwinkle plant. It is thought to interfere with cell division (mitosis). It is being studied as a treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoma. Side-effects include peripheral neuropathy (numbness or weakness in the limbs due to nerve damage), constipation and occasional hair loss. Vincristine is also known as vincristine sulphate. It is available as a generic (non-brandname) product, and is also manufactured by Lilly under the tradename Oncovin. * Vitamin A Vitamin A is a micronutrient which is present in some food and is necessary for normal human function. It is present at relatively high levels in most Western diets and can be stored in the liver and intestines for long periods, making vitamin A deficiency rare. Several studies have shown that vitamin A plays an important role in the immune system. Animal studies have shown that a shortage of vitamin A can cause immune problems and disease, and in areas where vitamin A deficiency is more common, such as parts of India, providing supplements of vitamin A has been shown to decrease childhood mortality. Studies have suggested that some people with HIV have vitamin A deficiency and that this may be associated with lower CD4 counts and an increased risk of mortality. Vitamin A deficiency may be a secondary consequence of malnutrition in people with HIV or could be a consequence of HIV infection itself, since infection and fever are known to cause depletion of the vitamin. In the test-tube, vitamin A increases HIV replication in some cell types and decreases replication in others. One study has suggested that HIV-positive pregnant women who have vitamin A deficiency may be more lilkely to transmit HIV to their children. Vitamin A is sometimes referred to as retinoic acid, a substance into which it is converted in the body. Current use It is unclear whether taking supplements of vitamin A can reverse deficiency or improve the clinical outcome of people with HIV. The vitamin, taken in the form of beta-carotene (see below) has been shown to improve symptoms and stabilise CD4 counts in a small two year study conducted amongst HIV-positive people in Italy (60 mg/day for 20 days out of 30). These promising results suggest further research is needed to investigate the benefits of beta carotene. The only side-effect of high doses of beta-carotene is the acquisition of orange skin tone. When this happens it means that fatty tissues are saturated with the vitamin. Taking it Vitamin A is naturally present at high levels in meat and liver (75,000 international units in half a pound of calves liver), tomatoes, apricots, sweet potatoes, broccoli, kale, spinach, red peppers, carrots and lettuce. It can also be purchased as a supplement from health food shops. This supplement is toxic in doses above 25,000 international units (IU) per day if taken for more than a few weeks. Signs of toxicity include headaches, nausea, blurred vision, sores on the skin and in more serious cases, internal bleeding, spontaneous fractures and bone malformations. The safest way to supplement vitamin A intake is by taking beta-carotene. This is a substance which is converted into an active form of vitamin A in the body as and when needed, thus preventing overdosing. A study in HIV-negative people suggested that beta-carotene is best absorbed when split into three doses during the day and taken with (ideally fatty) food. Beta-carotene is usually taken with 'rest periods', such as taking it for 20 days out of every 30. The rest period is assumed to be necessary to avoid the gradual lessening of the immunomodulatory effects of the vitamin. Doses of vitamin E is excess of 600 IU/day have been observed to interfere with beta-carotene absorption and utilisation. A trial of beta-carotene and/or ascorbic acid is taking place in Leeds. Key research Semba (1993) reported that 15% of a cohort of 126 of HIV-positive intravenous drug users had serum levels of vitamin A consistent with deficiency. Deficiency was associated with lower CD4 counts and an increased risk of mortality. Karter, Ward and Beach independently reported similar evidence of vitamin A deficiency among HIV-infected people. Semba (1994) reported that mean vitamin A concentration in 74 women in Malawi who transmitted HIV to their children was significantly lower than that in 264 women who did not transmit HIV to their children. 198 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 199](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/205?q1=directories) Poli reported that in vitro retinoic acid exerts potent suppressive and upregulatory effects on HIV expression in mononuclear phagocytes, strikingly similar to the effects of the cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). It significantly inhibited phorbol ester-mediated and completely suppressed the induction of virus production in U1 cells by interleukin 6 alone or in combination with glucocorticoids. Similar inhibitory effects were also observedin primary monocyte-derived macrophages previously infected with HIV and then exposed to either retinoic acid or TGF-beta. Turpin found that levels of HIV replication in monocytes cultured 7 days before and continuously after HIV infection in 1 to 10 pM retinoic acid were 10- to 20-fold greater than those of control cells. No direct toxicity (detachment from substrate or cell death) was evident in infected or control monocytes treated with less than or equal to 10 pM retinoic acid. RT activity in cultures of retinoic acid-treated monocytes reached maximum levels much earlier than those of control cultures, but the minimum tissue culture infectious doses for retinoic acid-treated and untreated monocytes were comparable. Retinoic acid treatment did not affect susceptibility of monocytes to HIV infection. These data show that retinoic acid significantly increased HIV replication in monocytes through mechanisms related to cell differentiation and to a direct transcriptional effect on viral gene expression. Bianchi-Santamaria enrolled 64 HIV-positive ex-drug users with ARC or lymphadenopathy who were resident in a drug rehabilitation unit in a study of beta-carotene (60 mg day for 20 out of every 30 days). 1 1 completed 24-36 months of treatment. A reduction in symptoms such as night sweats, fever, weight loss and diarrhoea was observed soon after the first 20 days of supplementation. During extended follow-up there was an average CD4 count increase of 11.5% in 9/11, none of whom developed further symptoms. Coodley conducted a placebo-controlled study of beta-carotene (180 mg/day) in 21 people with HIV, half of whom had a CD4 count below 200 and some of whom were also receiving AZT. Participants experienced an average CD4 count increase of 17% and an increase in their total white blood cell count which reversed on cessation of treatment. Garewal treated 11 HIV-positive men with CD4 counts above 200 with beta-carotene (60 mg/day) for 4 months. Natural killer cell levels rose, peaking at 3 months. No changes in CD4 or CD8 counts were observed. References Beach RS et al. Specific nutrient abnormalities in asymptomatic HIV-1 infection. AIDS 6:701-708, 1992. Bianchi-Santamaria A et al.

Requirements for this vitamin probably increase during feverish illness as the demand for carbohydrates increases. Good food sources of vitamin Bi are whole grains, wholemeal bread, brown rice and pulses are good sources. Vitamin A is also known as thiamin. * Vitamin B2 Vitamin B2 is an essential building block for glutathione, a key anti-oxidant. Deficiency symptoms include cracking at the corner of the mouth and on the lips. Diets low in dairy products are especially likely to be deficient. Good food sources of vitamin B2 are dairy products, green leafy vegetables, fruits, meat and cereals. Vitamin B2 is also known as riboflavin. * Vitamin B6 Vitamin B6 is essential for the formation of new cells and for maintaining immunity. Studies in animals show a range of immune defects when the diet is deficient. Although deficiency is rare in people eating a normal Western diet, low levels have been observed in people with HIV. Deficiency is difficult to diagnose. The vitamin can reduce the toxicities of the tuberculosis/MAl drug Isoniazid, and one study amongst HIV-positive gay men suggested that those deficient in vitamin B6 were more likely to be depressed and anxious and that when this deficiency was corrected, there was a significant decrease in depression (Shor-Posner). It has been suggested that AZT use increases the need for this vitamin, although studies have shown no clear link. Another study treated 12 HIV positive people with 20-25 mg of vitamin B6 and observed a small increase in CD4 count amongst 8 of the 12 over a six month period. In contrast, an untreated control group showed no improvement in CD4 count (Mantero-Atienza). Doses of more than 2 grammes a day have been shown to cause nerve damage. Watch the quantity contained in multivitamin supplements; most nutritionists believe 50 mg to be adequate for anyone. Good food sources of vitamin B6 are meat, whole grains, brewer's yeast and whole grains, wholemeal bread. Vitamin B6 is also known as pyridoxine. References Mantero-Atienza E et al. Vitamin B-6 and immune function in HIV infection. 6th Intl Conf AIDS, San Francisco, abstract 3 123, 1990. Shor-Posner G et al. Anxiety and depression in early HIV- 1 infection and its association with vitamin B-6 status. 8th Intl Conf AIDS, Amsterdam, abstract PoB 3711, 1992. * Vitamin B12 Several studies have shown low levels of vitamin B12 in HIV-positive people (Burkes; Harriman). Depletion in body tissues may begin to occur at least a year before blood levels become abnormally low. Vitamin B12 is thought by some doctors to protect against nerve damage and neurological disorders. Injected supplementation has been tested in HIV-positive people by Dr Richard Beach and appears to improve mental functioning (Beach). Another study also showed that A-Z OF TREATMENTS 199 [Page 200](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/206?q1=directories) vitamin B12 supplementation for at least six months improved mental functioning in HIV-positive people who had been deficient; an untreated control group did not show improvement (Baum). Peripheral neuropathy, a symptom sometimes seen in HIV-positive people and often related to the use of drugs such as ddl and ddC, can be caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, so this should always be ruled out before assuming that the neuropathy is HIV-related. As yet there is no evidence that prophylactic treatment with vitamin B12 will reduce the likelihood that neuropathy will develop in those receiving ddl or ddC. It has been suggested that B12 supplementation may reduce the risk of neutropenia and anaemia resulting from AZT use. B12 is used in the production of thymidine phosphate, necessary both to break down AZT in the blood and to create red blood cells. Unless enough of this vitamin is present, AZT competes with red blood cells for available thymidine triphosphate. People who are already deficient in B12 when they begin AZT therapy may be more vulnerable to anaemia and neutropenia (Richman). However, a 1989 study showed that B12 supplementation does not reduce AZT toxicities once therapy has begun (McCutchan). Absorption of vitamin B12 in HIV-positive people with gastrointestinal problems is poor unless the vitamin is injected or taken in a form that will dissolve in the mouth and be absorbed across the mucous membranes, according to some nutritionists. This vitamin treatment is available on NHS prescription for dietary deficiency. All the B vitamins operate in combination, and also act in conjunction with other vitamins and minerals, so vitamin B12 is best taken alongside a B-complex formula. Good food sources are fish, dairy products, kidneys, liver, eggs, beef and pork. Vegans' diets are especially likely to lack vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is also known as cobalamin. References Baum MK.

A severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy, a disease characterised by connective tissue disorders, impaired wound healing, bleeding gums and other serious symptoms. The effect of vitamin C deficiency on the immune system is unclear, with contradictory evidence. There is reason to believe that vitamin C may play a significant role in cellular immunity. In the test-tube, very high concentrations of vitamin C can prevent HIV from infecting new cells and prevent the activation and replication of HIV in dormant infected cells. Vitamin C also dramatically reduced the formation of syncytia, clumps of dysfunctional T-cells which form around an HIV-infected T-cell in the test tube. Syncytia tend to appear more frequently when CD4 counts are falling rapidly, and it has been theorised that their appearance may indicate an increased chance that AIDS related illnesses will develop. In vitro vitamin C has also been shown to inactivate other viruses such as herpes simplex, rabies and tobacco mosaic virus. As well as these antiviral effects, vitamin C is required by phagocytes (immune cells which fight bacterial and fungal infections). High levels of vitamin C assist phagocytes in identifying and destroying candida and other fungi, suggesting that vitamin C may play a role in protection against fungal infections. Vitamin E is thought to to play a similar role, and has been shown to reduce the level of such infections in the elderly, who often have poor immune function. The presence of vitamin C is also crucial to the effectiveness of enzymes in the liver which remove toxins from the body. Vitamin C is also known as ascorbic acid or ascorbate. Current use There is no evidence that taking supplements of vitamin C can delay progression or improve survival in people with HIV. The use of vitamin C as a treatment is based mainly on the test-tube studies demonstrating its anti-HIV effects. These studies also suggest that vitamin C's in vitro activity against HIV is enhanced when it is used in combination with NAC. The researcher who demonstrated vitamin C's anti-HIV effects in vitro believes that doses of at least 10 g/day are needed in order to produce the viral inhibition he observed in his laboratory studies. However, high doses of vitamin C cause diarrhoea, a sign that the gut can absorb no more of the vitamin. Bowel tolerance varies from one person to another, and is believed to depend upon the ability of the individual to metabolise the vitamin. People with acute illnesses such as PCP are reported to have tolerated doses of 60-150 g/day before the onset of diarrhoea. Other researchers fear that doses much higher than 10-12 g/day may have unforeseeable long-term side effects and that doses higher than this should be used only in the case of an acute infection, and only then under medical supervision. High doses of vitamin C may cause kidney stones due to excess acidity. It is possible to test for susceptibility to kidney stones by doing tests for oxalic acid excretion in urine at different levels of vitamin C use. If oxalic acid excretion increases as the dose increases, an individual is vulnerable, but protection against elevated levels of oxalic acid is provided by taking 50-100 mg of vitamin B6 and a magnesium supplement alongside vitamin C. 200 A-Z OF TREATMENTS [Page 201](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/207?q1=directories) A more serious reaction to high doses of vitamin C may be experienced by people who have a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This deficiency is found in about 10% of black Americans and is even more common in Africans and people of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern origin. In one case a man receiving massive doses of vitamin C intravenously suffered a shock reaction in which his red blood cells ruptured. Oral vitamin C is not thought to be capable of triggering such a haemolytic shock. Taking it Unlike virtually every other animal and plant species, humans cannot manufacture sufficient quantities of vitamin C for themselves. Instead, it has to be obtained from food. Vitamin C is found naturally in many foods including citrus fruits, green vegetables, liver and kidney. Different forms of vitamin C are available. Ascorbic acid is a highly acidic powder, which can cause stomach pain and discomfort when taken in large doses. Calcium ascorbate is a less acidic form of vitamin C buffered with calcium which tastes so unpleasant it makes some people sick. It can be dissolved in fruit juice or any liquid to mask the taste. Tablets are a much more expensive way of taking the vitamin in large quantitities, but some manufacturers claim that one form of tableted ascorbate, ester-C, yields three times as much vitamin C in the body i.e. a 1 g tablet yields 3 g when metabolised. If stopping vitamin C, the dose use should be reduced gradually to reduce the risk of so-called 'rebound scurvy'. A trial of beta-carotene and/or ascorbic acid is taking place in Leeds. Key research Jariwalla observed that in HXB cells exposed to the highest nontoxic dose of ascorbate (0.85 mM) for 4 days at 37 degrees C, extracellular RT activity was lowered by greater than 99% and p24 HIV core antigen was reduced by approximately 90%. Long-term experiments showed that continuous presence of ascorbate was necessary for HIV suppression. In HXB cells, a nontoxic dose (10 mM) of NAC alone, caused at best approximately 46% inhibition of HIV RT activity and approximately 90% reduction in the p24 antigen level in the culture supernatant. When 10 mM NAC was tested simultaneously with a low dose of ascorbate (0.43 mmol/L), the combination conferred a synergistic inhibition of extracellular HIV RT (approximately 8-fold inhibition). Harakeh reported that vitamin C suppressed HIV production and cell fusion in infected T-lymphocytic cell-lines grown in the presence of non-toxic concentrations of ascorbate. In chronically infected cells expressing HIV at peak levels, ascorbate reduced the levels of extracellular reverse transcriptase (RT) activity by greater than 99% and of p24 antigen (by 90%) in the culture supernatant. Under similar conditions, no detectable inhibitory effects on cell viability, host metabolic activity, and protein synthesis were observed. In freshly infected CD4 cells, ascorbate inhibited the formation of giant-cell syncytia (by approximately 93%). References Harakeh S et al.

BMJ 841-842, 1993. * Vitamin D Limited evidence about this vitamin suggests that high levels may actually have an immune suppressive effect and that it may stimulate HIV production. This evidence is based on test tube studies. On the other hand, the active form of vitamin D has also been shown to stimulate macrophages, white blood cells which combat opportunistic infection such as tuberculosis. Vitamin D production is stimulated by sunlight, but the vitamin is not abundant in foods, except for oily fish, egg yolks and liver. * Vitamin E An important anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory, often lacking in HIV-positive people. Vitamin E is necessary to ensure the optimum functioning of cell membranes. Deficiency may interfere with efficient immune functions, but so may doses above 600 i.u. a day. Vitamin E stimulates CD4 cell proliferation at high doses. It's not known whether this is beneficial at all, or any, stages of HIV infection. The safe dose is not yet known. Vitamin E has been shown to improve the anti-viral effect of AZT in the test tube, but it has no anti-viral effect on its own. There are no studies of its specific benefits in HIV-positive people except in the improvement of seborrheic dermatitis. Italian doctors found that HIV-positive people with ARC who took 300-600 i.u. of vitamin E with selenium and methionine saw improvements in seborrheic dermatitis and overall white blood cell count (Ippolito). Good food sources of vitamin E are whole grains, cereals, eggs, sunflower and olive oil and green leafy vegetables. References Ippolito F et al. Administration of anti-oxidants and w6 PUFA improves seborrheic dermatitis in HIV positive patients. 9th Conf AIDS, Berlin, abstract PoB29-2185, 1993. * VX-478 VX-478 is the codename for a protease inhibitor which was developed by the company Vertex, and has been licensed to Wellcome. It is also known by the codename 141 W94. Early tests have shown that it is adequately absorbed into the body when taken by mouth and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Test-tube studies suggest that it can inhibit a wide variety of HIV strains and is synergistic with other anti-HIV drugs including protease inhibitors. * Zinc An important anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory mineral which plays a key role in immune functions. An adequate level of zinc improves resistance to infections, boosts antibody production, maintains levels of hormones in the thymus (the organ responsible for producing T-cells) and permits vigorous T-cell responses. Zinc competes with copper for absorption. A two and half year study in asymptomatic HIV-positive people showed that significantly lowered levels of zinc in serum (and correspondingly elevated levels of copper) were A-Z OF TREATMENTS 201 [Page 202](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/208?q1=directories) a strong predictor of progression to AIDS. The study failed to show any relationship between dietary intake of zinc and serum levels, suggesting that supplementation may not slow disease progression (Graham). However, another smaller study showed that when compared with an untreated HIV-negative group, eleven HIV-positive men who received 1 mg/kg body weight (about 60-70 mg a day for the average adult male) of zinc sulphate for ten weeks gained weight and showed a moderate increase in CD4 count (Isa). Italian researchers found that giving 200 mg of zinc sulphate for 30 days to AZT-treated people reduced the subsequent incidence of opportunistic infections in the study group when compared with a control group of AZT-treated patients. The study followed 18 people with lymphadenopathy but no other symptoms and 12 people who had already been diagnosed with AIDS. The study followed patients for two years and noted 9 opportunistic infections in the symptomatic, zinc-treated group compared with 26 in the control group. In the lymphadenopathy group only one zinc-treated individual developed an opportunistic infection compared with 13 in the AZT-only group. There was a clear difference in the incidence of PCP, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus and TB between the AZT-only and the AZT plus zinc groups, but none in the incidence of CMV disease or oesophageal candidiasis. The study report provides no information on whether patients were matched for length of time on AZT or CD4 count, nor whether they were randomised to the control group or the zinc treatment group (Mocchegiani). This study needs to be treated with caution because of the confounding effect of AZT treatment on zinc status. Dr Richard Beach has noted that in a group of patients who began AZT treatment, serum zinc levels continued to decline, whilst a matched group of patients who did not receive AZT showed no change in zinc status. Some studies have shown that low serum zinc is a strong predictor of CD4 decline. Overdosing with zinc is dangerous: it can impair immune responses and disrupt the metabolism of iron in the body, leading to anaemia. Doses above 200 mg/day are not recommended and anaemia and neutropenia have been noted in people receiving doses above 50 mg a day. Zinc comes in several forms; if taking a supplement you should check what quantity of elemental zinc is contained in the supplement. High zinc intake is especially dangerous in people with candida. If supplementing it is important to ensure an adequate intake of copper and selenium, since these minerals compete for absorption. Intakes of zinc as low as 50mg a day have been shown to interfere with the utilisation of copper and lead to symptoms such as lowered white blood cell count, lack of resistance to bacterial infections and to anaemia. Good food sources of zinc are whole-grain products, brewers' yeast, wheat bran and germ, seafoods and animal meats. References Graham NMH et al.

It is used frequently by people with HIV for its ability to improve well-being, relieve some symptoms and reduce stress levels. See Traditional Chinese Medicine for a full description of this therapy. * Aromatherapy Aromatherapy involves the use of essential oils, which are usually extracted from plants through distillation. Each oil is reputed to have a different healing effect on the mind or body and the oils are used in a variety of ways: for massage, inhalation and in baths and compresses. Many ancient civilizations have used aromatic plants therapeutically. The Egyptians are said to have burnt gums and resins to give clarity of mind and the Romans used essential oils for massage. They were burnt and used in the form of infusions in the 17th century against bubonic plague but their current application has only developed since the 1930s, when a French pharmacist, Gattefosse, burnt his hand and, after plunging it into a vat of lavender oil at the perfume factory where he worked, noticed subsequent swift and scar-free healing. His research into the healing properties of other oils was followed by research by Dr Valnet who used essential oils in surgery during the Second World War when antiseptic drugs were scarce. Despite this clinical background, aromatherapy has been marketed in the UK as a luxury therapy associated with the beauty industry and this has held back its reputation as a serious therapy. Recently however it has begun to be used more frequently in hospitals and other treatment centres and more research is being carried out into its possible benefits. In France however aromatherapy does have a medical status; in contrast to the UK, where oral prescription is illegal, essential oils do have a clinical, internal use. They are for instance frequently prescribed in place of antibiotics. This difference in approach is partly because the first researchers in France were medically trained. The use of aromatherapy by people with HIV Aromatherapy can be an excellent way of treating stress, promoting relaxation and treating tension pains such as muscle fatigue and other symptoms where there may be an underlying emotional cause. Because the usual method of application is through massage, touch is also extremely important, and psychologically this can help the client to A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 203 [Page 204](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/210?q1=directories) get back in touch with his or her body. An aromatherapist will normally take a full case history at the first session and then prescribe accordingly, but aromatherapy is not a diagnostic therapy. In this country treatment usually consists of massage. Most aromatherapists aim to relax rather than to stimulate and would use light massage and gentle holding techniques. Essential oils are said to have their own energetic properties and will be picked to suit the individual. Rose 'Otto', for instance, is recommended as an excellent oil for detoxification and cleansing. It is believed to dissipate anger, lift depression and energise and open the heart energy centre. It is connected to the heart, self-healing and self love and is also related to the thymus gland. Therefore aromatherapy can work on both an energetic level and a physical/psychological level. Clients tend to come primarily for relaxation, to relieve stress and promote change, rather than for specific conditions. However, some oils are said to be helpful in promoting immune function (tea-tree) and for combatting fungal infections. Essential oils can also sometimes counteract the side-effects of some orthodox drugs such as nausea. Adverse reactions to essential oils The importance of seeing a qualified aromatherapist cannot be too highly stressed as some essential oils are potentially toxic if wrongly administered. Some oils such as myrrh are emmenagogic (will bring on a period) and should therefore be avoided during pregnancy; some, such as bergamot, are photo-toxic so that skin damage may result following exposure to the sun. This is especially relevant since aromatherapy is often on offer from under-qualified individuals at beauty parlours who also provide sunbeds. Some oils may provoke physical symptoms; for instance when a body is detoxifying there may be a headache or flu-like symptoms. Therapists should warn clients that such symptoms could occur. If a client wants treatment for a serious condition, the aromatherapist should get his/her permission to check with the GP. Combination with other treatments Aromatherapy is not recommended for use when homoeopathic treatment is being given as the oils may affect the energy patterns of the remedies. It is suitable for use with most other therapies. Some of the oils are also useful for counteracting the unwanted side-effects of some orthodox medications, for instance the nausea associated with chemotherapy, but it is important that any possible interactions between essential oils and treatment drugs should be checked out with your primary medical practitioner first. It is important that therapists obtain their oils from a reputable supplier. Some suppliers will only supply to qualified aromatherapists. They can, on request, supply a chemical breakdown of the individual oils. Self-help Whilst aromatherapy can be used at home, it is best to seek advice about safe practice from a fully qualified practitioner, as some oils are too potent to be used without supervision. One example of an oil which is used safely for many functions is lavender, which can be used to deal with insomnia, anxiety, headaches, depression and to promote relaxation by dropping one to four drops of oil in a bath or one drop on your pillow at night. It is also said to have good wound-healing properties (five drops in 25ml of mineral water, applied with cotton wool). In massage oil it can help with aching muscles. Finding an experienced practitioner It is important to find a properly qualified therapist as many people offer aromatherapy who have merely done weekend courses. Regulation of aromatherapy is non-existent and there are many different registers of practititioners. Some, such as the Register of Qualified Aromatherapists, demand considerable periods of study; others allow practitioners to call themselves aromatherapists with very limited qualifications. The Institute of Complementary Medicine can advise on the qualifications of aromatherapists. Recommendations for sensitive practitioners from other users at HIV centres can be helpful. Once there, the first session will usually consist of an in-depth consultation about medical history, diet, general health and stresses. The therapist will then make up a blend of oils in a base massage oil which is administered through full body massage. Relaxing music may also be played or the therapist might use relaxing visualisation or breathing techniques. As the therapy aims to involve the client in the process, it is important for the client to be comfortable with the therapist and to feel easy about saying no to any treatment suggestion he/she is unhappy with.

It aims to turn off the stressful 'fight-flight' mechanism in the body and direct the mind and body towards a state of deep relaxation which is an important pre-requisite for healing. The exercises aim to balance the sympathetic nervous system, which is broadly responsible for stress-related symptoms including emotional problems such as anger and anxiety, with the para-sympathetic nervous system which is responsible for relaxation and recuperation. A harmonious balance leads to good health, a feeling of well-being and empowerment. Autogenic training exercises aim to give users control over the mental, physical and emotional aspects of their lives through a series of 'internal commands'. The process also allows the users to get in touch with their own healing powers. In common with all other forms of deep relaxation including meditation, the individual may get in touch with deep, buried, unresolved memories and emotions which may be contributing to their problems and symptoms. But unlike other forms of deep relaxation techniques, autogenic training offers practical exercises to deal with emotions such as fear, anger, depression, anxiety and frustration which may arise as a consequence of autogenic exercises. How it works The training starts with a series of mental exercises concentrating on normal physiological sensations such as heaviness, warmth and cooling, starting in the periphery of the body i.e. the limbs, and gradually working to deeper areas such as the heart, the circulation, the solar plexus and the breathing over the next 7-8 weeks. The solar plexus is said by autogenic trainers to be the junction box and the point of interplay between the sympathetic and the para-sympathetic nervous system. Through other nerves the solar plexus is also connected with the brain and hence with the immune system through nervous, chemical and endocrine systems. The most important concept in AT is the process of 'passive concentration' (as opposed to the normal active concentration, which is aim-orientated). During this process the user repeats the appropriate phrases and watches and feels what is happening both to the specific body part under attention and to the rest of the body, mind, emotions and spirit. As individuals work inward to deep within themselves, they may become aware of emotional or psychological problems which may be contributory factors leading to their symptoms. This is the time when the emotional off-loading exercises come into their own. However, as AT is not a psychotherapeutic technique, the individual may need further counselling if their problems are too entrenched to be resolved by the combination of AT and off-loading exercises. Autogenic training and HIV/AIDS AT's approach to HIV is exactly the same as with any other condition. What is likely to vary is the degree of support required by the individual. Practitioners say that AT can change people's attitude toward their illness and enable them to live fully. You can learn the technique individually but AT is often more effective when carried out in groups as deeper states of relaxation are said to be achieved. Friendship and support can also develop in this context. However, one of its most important functions is to provide the user with an effective tool to empower themselves to take charge of their life. There are specific exercises for stress and fear. In terms of symptom control, AT has specific exercises which are directed at specific organs. It could, for instance, help relieve breathing problems associated with PCP. There have been good results in the control of night sweats, diarrhoea and weight loss, according to some practitioners of the technique. The technique may also help in reviving energy or assisting sleep. With the exception of conditions contraindicated below, nothing in the technique can make the disease or its symptoms worse. Contraindications AT is contraindicated in the following conditions: * Psychosis: there may be a motivation problem; deep relaxation can trigger psychotic symptoms; if the patient is on controlled drug therapy (e.g. in a hospital setting) AT could possibly be used. * Insulin-dependent diabetes: exercises may interfere with pancreas and send insulin supply haywire. * Epilepsy: electrical impulses in the brain may be affected. * Alcoholism: AT can bring on withdrawal Time commitment and motivation AT works best when an individual is strongly motivated, with a high degree of commitment towards using self-healing techniques. However practititioners accept clients with many different states of mind, even those who may wish to die. The important thing is to be sufficiently motivated to continue carrying out the exercises which become increasingly pleasurable and relaxing. The main exercise takes 10 to 20 minutes, starting with three 5 minute sessions each day and progressing to two 20 minute sessions each day. The technique is versatile however, allowing you to top-up with short exercises if time is short, but you still need a minimum of one 20 minute exercise per day to keep mind and body in touch.

They were discovered by Dr Edward Bach, who originally trained as a bacteriologist and pathologist before the First World War. On becoming disillusioned with orthodox medicine he became involved with homoeopathy and during his work in this area he became aware of the need for remedies based on the patient's emotional condition. This arose out of his increasing awareness of the patient as a whole being rather than as a set of symptoms and his conclusion that many physical conditions result from negative states of mind, apprehension, apathy or irritability. Abandoning the empirical approach of orthodox medicine, Dr Bach began to work in a more intuitive fashion, concentrating on communicating with flowering plants in order to understand their specific properties. He evolved a method of preparing remedies from 38 wild flower plants. Dr Bach's somewhat esoteric methods, justified in mystical terms, did not enhance his credibility with the medical profession. However, a large number of people, including medical practitioners do use and believe in the the' effectiveness of Bach flower remedies. The best known of them is Rescue Remedy which is said to be invaluable in cases of shock and distress for inducing calm and decreasing anxiety. Detractors may feel that these kind of benefits derive from the alcoholic tincture in which the flower essences are held, but it is hard to deny the anecdotal evidence of so many enthusiasts who swear by the restorative powers of the flower remedies. Although Bach flower remedies are sometimes prescribed by herbalists and homoeopaths, they are well-suited to self-help, being harmless and inexpensive. They are available from homoeopathic pharmacies and from many wholefood shops. For further information on Bach flower remedies, you can contact The Edward Bach Centre, Mount Vernon, Sotwell, Wallingford, Oxfordshire OX10 OPZ. * Crystal therapy The idea that precious stones and crystals have healing properties dates back to ancient Egypt and elixirs containing precious stones were part of medieval European and Arabic medicine. Like many other esoteric aspects of ancient medicine, the use of precious stones and crystals had astrological significance, but today crystal therapists tend to suggest that the healing power of crystals lies in their energy fields. Crystal therapists say that different crystals have different energy fields or wavelengths, and that these will act upon the human body in different ways. Crystals are said to be highly concentrated energy fields. Many healers who say that they are channelling energy will use crystals as part of this process. See Healing and therapeutic touch for an overview of this form of therapy. * Dietary therapies Virtually all forms of complementary and alternative medicine emphasise the role of diet in health. Some, such as naturopathy, make dietary adjustment a central part of the therapy. Broadly speaking, the dietary adjustments proposed by alternative therapists can be divided up into the following groups: * Macrobiotic diets * Anti-candida diets * Organic, wholefood & raw food diets * Dietary adjustments to improve specific symptoms * Micronutrient/multivitamin supplements. The last of these categories is described under the section on Vitamins and minerals. The benefits of dietary adjustments Dietary adjustment has hardly been studied amongst people with AIDS except in relation to the prevention of weight loss. Although this is clearly very important, there remain many unanswered questions about the role of dietary adjustments in alleviating or preventing AIDS-related illnesses. Nutritional status undoubtedly has an effect on immunity. This has been established through studies in different population groups in different parts of the world, and it has been suggested that an important reason for the decline in epidemic, infectious disease during the 20th century in the developed world is not just improved sanitation and improved medical care, but a better diet leading to improved immunity against infection. Many complementary and alternative therapists have views on diet and health which differ radically from those widely accepted by the medical profession. For instance, many naturopaths think that one of the causes of cancer, along with other lifestyle factors, may be an imbalance in the acidity of the body's tissues brought on over many years by eating foods which are too acidic. Cancer specialists dismiss this idea as fanciful. 206 A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES [Page 207](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/213?q1=directories) Dietary changes may be particularly attractive because they are one area which is under the control of the individual alone. Changing the way you eat is a far more significant life change than is often imagined; it often requires changes in habits which are deeply engrained, and one of the consequences of a wholesale change in diet may be a subtle re-evaluation of many other areas of life. The often repeated phrase 'you are what you eat' is true on a psychological as well as a physical level and for someone who wants to make a commitment to self-healing, the daily rituals of food preparation can be an important reminder that looking after yourself starts with your most basic bodily needs. Macrobiotic diets Macrobiotic diets are based in Chinese and Japanese beliefs about the need to eat a diet which balances yin and yang energies. Macrobiotic diets have been advocated from the earliest years of the AIDS epidemic and many individuals report that a macrobiotic diet has helped them. The diet consists of balancing the intake of yin and yang foods. Yin foods tend to be fruit, vegetables, pulses, stimulants, fermented drinks and sugary foods. Yang foods are meat, grains, fish and some oriental seasonings. The diet is high in complex carbohydrates and the protein sources in the diet are just as likely to be grains and tofu as meat or fish. Macrobiotic teachers emphasise that the diet can be changed according to an individual's health and needs. Some dietitians have warned that a macrobiotic diet may lack the calories necessary to maintain a stable weight, it may lack vitamin B1 2 if it excludes meat and that it may be difficult to digest for someone with digestive problems. Macrobiotic teachers say that the diet contains substances such as miso which aid digestion even in people who have digestive problems. The high levels of fibre in the diet may also make it difficult to sustain for anyone suffering from diarrhoea. Anti-candida diets Over the past twenty years an increasing number of complementary and alternative health practitioners have adopted the view that candida albicans, or thrush, is a major health problem and that it is responsible for more illness than is generally accepted by orthodox physicians. Theories about candida remain controversial and are dismissed by many doctors as lacking in strong supporting evidence. Nevertheless, an increasing number of complementary and alternative practitioners make dietary recommendations intended to reduce candida infestation and heal the problems they believe to be associated with candida. Candida is a fungus which proliferates in the gut and other mucous membranes when the resident bacteria become depleted or when immunity declines. These bacteria are said to become depleted in several ways: * Antibiotic treatment: antibiotics kill the resident gut bacteria which control candida growth * Weakened immunity: a weakened immune system is unable to control candida growth * Diet high in sugar and low in fibre is said to allow candida to proliferate Once candida levels increase, a number of problems are said to occur: * The release of toxins into the bloodstream which cause generalised symptoms such as fatigue, anxiety, depression, poor memory, craving for sugar. Candida toxins are also said to disrupt liver function * Hypoglycaemia leading to suppressed immune functions * Damage to the lining of the gut, permitting food and wastes to come into contact with the bloodstream and subsequent allergic reactions * Malabsorption of nutrients due to damage to the gut wall and inflammation * Spread of candida to other sites in the body: in women, vaginal thrush is a particular symptom These views are strongly disputed by most doctors, who say that the only evidence that candida causes severe problems is seen in people whose immune systems cannot keep candida in check. These people will suffer oral and oesophageal (throat) thrush as a consequence of immunosuppression. The effects of candida are one of the sharpest areas of controversy between the medical profession and complementary and alternative practitioners and you are likely to hear strongly conflicting views. In these circumstances you have to make up your own mind. Non-NHS nutritionists will usually recommend that you make every effort to avoid sugar and simple carbohydrates in processed foods such as white bread, white flour, pastry, white pasta and white rice. Alcohol should also be avoided. The anti-candida diet is a type of restricted or eliminative/cleansing diet based on fresh vegetables, lightly cooked whole grains (although wheat is usually excluded) and easily digested proteins such as white meat, fish, free range eggs and pulses combined with grains (brown rice, millet and buckwheat) and yoghurt, but no other dairy products or tofu. Oatmeal is also permitted but fruit is excluded for the first 2-4 weeks and then re-introduced in moderate amounts. Also included are olive oil for its oleic oil content (believed to inhibit candidal growth), garlic (2-3 cloves a day in food) for its anti-fungal action, and Pau d'Arco, a tea prepared by boiling one tablespoon in one cup of water for ten minutes and then drunk on an empty stomach 10-20 minutes before the first food of the day. This is also said to have anti-fungal action. Caprylic acid capsules, propolis and aloe vera liquid are also recommended on occasion to inhibit fungal growth, but their effectiveness is unknown. Foods excluded are mainly those which tend to be contaminated with mould or fungi such as nuts and mushrooms. Also excluded are those which are believed to cause intolerance due to sensitivity, or allergy due to the exposure of complete or partially degraded proteins to the human immune system as a result of a damaged gut lining. These include wheat products and products containing yeast or sugar. Also eliminated are cheese and dairy products, with the exception of yoghurt, tea, coffee, fruit juice, vinegar, alcohol and soy sauce. A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 207 [Page 208](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/214?q1=directories) This diet is fairly demanding and may be difficult to get used to because of the lack of sweet foods, tea and coffee. It may also be difficult socially. Individuals often report feeling worse for 7-10 days, which therapists say is due to detoxification. The effectiveness of this diet in clearing candida problems or preventing their development in people with HIV has never been studied, so if complementary and alternative practitioners claim that this is a proven way to treat candida in HIV-positive people, bear in mind that we only have anecdotes from people who have tried the diet and from practitioners who advocate the diet. Conventional medications such as the -azole anti-fungal drugs are usually fairly successful at eliminating candida and preventing recurrences, but there is a danger that resistant strains of candida will develop or that side-effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal pain will make the treatment unsustainable. Whilst many HIV-positive people with candida in the mouth or oesophagus but no other major symptoms report benefits from an anti-candida diet, such a diet may be problematic for someone who is beginning to lose weight. It may not contain high enough levels of carbohydrates either to maintain normal levels of energy and activity or to maintain lean muscle mass. Organic, raw food & whole food diets Naturopathic practitioners advise people to switch to a diet which is high in wholefoods and raw fruit and vegetables in order to avoid augmenting the toxins which reinforce disease states and symptoms and to supply a wider range of nutrients. For people without symptoms this may be a realistic option, but many people with symptoms report difficulty in sticking to such a diet, which may require more shopping and preparation time, more discomfort in eating, and the risk of weight loss due to lack of carbohydrate intake. If a practitioner recommends such a diet, ask for practical examples of foods and recipes that will help you. If the practitioner isn't a good source of tips on how to cook and eat well on this diet, you may find that an NHS dietitian will be able to offer you this form of advice, even though they wouldn't necessarily recommend the diet. Making sure that patients can implement dietary advice on a day to day basis is what NHS dietitians do best, so make use of this service. Ask at your local clinic for a referral to a dietitian if you haven't yet seen one. Dietary adjustments to relieve other symptoms Herpes Arginine is an amino-acid found in chocolate, nuts, beer and pulses. Some amino-acid supplements for body builders contain large amounts of arginine, because it may help stimulate the hormone involved in building muscle. If there is too much arginine in the diet, some researchers think this stimulates the herpes virus. Many people with herpes have long suspected that their attacks are triggered by these foods, but it is difficult to tell if a food triggers herpes attacks when stress and ill-health are also implicated. It has been suggested that lysine may prevent herpes attacks. Lysine is an amino-acid found in dairy products, brewer's yeast and potatoes. Some practitioners recommend lysine as prophylaxis against herpes. Only one study has demonstrated that people who received a supplement of 1248mg/day of lysine suffered fewer herpes attacks than those who received either none or 624 mg/day. Other studies have failed to show a link. None of the studies showed any effect on the severity of the attacks when lysine supplements were given, nor did they show any correlation between arginine intake and herpes attacks. Diarrhoea Any diarrhoea needs to be thoroughly investigated by a doctor who is an HIV specialist. In the meantime there are several measures which can be taken which may reduce the severity of diarrhoea or prevent it from developing in the first place. Much of this advice is common to the medical profession and complementary and alternative practitioners. The risk of diarrhoea may be reduced by boiling all drinking water (do not rely on bottled water, since this has not been tested for micro-organisms), refrigerating and discarding after twelve hours. Commercial water filters may remove some impurities but in themselves do not protect against some of the micro-organisms which can cause diarrhoea in immunocompromised people. Food hygiene is also important: * Don't take chances eating anything which you suspect to be going off; whilst a healthy immune response may be able to cope with the micro-organisms in slightly 'off' food, immune compromised people are less able to keep these bugs in check. * Wash food thoroughly, especially if it is to be eaten raw. * Do not eat re-heated food unless it has been heated to above boiling point and never eat re-heated chicken, pork or foods containing dairy products or eggs. * Avoid take-away food and don't eat in restaurants where you have suspicions about food hygiene. Possible ways of reducing diarrhoea: * Cut down on your fat intake including dairy products (although yoghurt, especially goat's milk, is still alright). * Cut down on insoluble fibre such as bran or brown bread. * Increase your intake of soluble fibre: apple sauce, bananas, oatmeal porridge, potatoes, pulses. * Ensure adequate fluid intake, but avoid drinks which promote urination such as tea and coffee. Water, chamomile, peppermint, blackberry leaf or raspberry leaf tea are preferable. Dilute fruit juice with water; acidic fruit juices are liable to increase diarrhoea. A low residue diet is best: white rice with home-made apple sauce, vegetable soup with pearl barley, cooked peeled potatoes, yoghut, white meat or fish (very fresh and well cooked), poached eggs and white toast (no butter), banana. This restricted form of diet needs to be monitored carefully and shouldn't be sustained for too long. Aim to introduce other foods gradually after two to three days, and note which ones exacerbate diarrhoea. It should be emphasised that this diet is not a cure for whatever is causing 208 A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES [Page 209](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/215?q1=directories) diarrhoea; it is a means of symptom control. Prompt and effective treatment for the cause of diarrhoea is always needed to prevent weight loss. If you are at all worried about weight loss, remember that NHS dietitians can prescribe easily absorbed supplemental drinks to maintain calorie, protein and vitamin intake.

Exercise can also improve mood and offer an important way of maintaining a healthy self-image for HIV-positive people. Activities which maintain or even build muscle mass are an important way of minimising the effects of weight loss in AIDS. People with less muscle mass are likely to be more severely weakened by weight loss/wasting, because it is usually muscle tissue that is broken down first in HIV wasting syndrome. Exercise also improves lung function; this may reduce the likelihood of chest infections. Besides popular forms of exercise like swimming, cycling, aerobics, weight training, and running, there are a number of movement-based exercise regimes which help maintain muscle tone and suppleness and which also have meditative or relaxing qualities: T'ai chi is a Chinese form of exercise which uses slow and flowing movement to both discipline and calm the mind, body and spirit. The exercises are intended to centre and direct the qi, the life-force, and many practitioners of Chinese medicine will prescribe gentle t'ai chi exercises to patients as part of a programme of treatment. T'ai chi is probably most familiar to Westerners from films of early morning exercises practiced by Chinese workers, but it is also widely practiced in the West, and T'ai chi classes are available in most parts of the country. Yoga is an Indian form of exercise which is often practiced alongside meditation. It is said to allow the mind to more fully let go of the mundane and the trivial through disciplining the body to accept discomforts. Most practitioners of yoga say that it increases suppleness, improves breathing control and posture, and relaxes the mind, body and spirit. Alexander technique is a form of movement therapy which seeks to correct problems of posture, the theory being that postural problems are related both to other health problems and to stress and mental attitudes. Alexander technique may be of benefit to people with HIV as a form of self-empowerment; many people who have a poor self-image report that their feelings about themselves have been altered as a result of a course of exercise. * Healing and therapeutic touch Healing, sometimes known as spiritual healing, therapeutic touch or the laying on of hands, is a process in which the healer acts as a channel to direct healing energy to the client (known as a healee) in order to stimulate and balance his or her own healing powers. The external energy with which the healer connects is often described as a higher spiritual force. One healer describes the process like this: \"I become the light which comes through me. I don't exist as a person. I have no thoughts but light and energy. True healing takes place when the healer, healee, and the light and love become one.\" Although this may sound rather esoteric and mystifying, we all clearly do have our own healing powers which we take more or less for granted: we assume, for instance, that a cut finger will automatically heal itself. Healing merely aims to develop and extend the healing energies we already possess. Healing is not seen as a substitute or replacement but as complementary to other forms of treatment. Evidence that healing works Healing is often dismissed as a form of trickery which is attractive to vulnerable people, and which provides no physical benefit, merely psychological comfort. Nevertheless many people report physical or psychological benefits as a result of receiving some form of healing and some measurable physical changes and benefits have been noted when healing has been studied. A great deal of research into the efficacy of one form of healing has been carried out by nurses studying therapeutic touch; studies into anxiety have been carried out with groups of patients of all ages with cardiac conditions; separate research into the healing of wounds used volunteers who agreed to receive incisions to their arms (Wirth). In each trial, one part of the group receiving healing from an experienced healer, while the other part received simulated motions of healing from inexperienced people or none at all. All these trials produced positive results (Quinn). Therapeutic touch has also shown to be of benefit in pain relief (Wright). Another study with young children showed that therapeutic touch greatly reduced the time needed to calm them after stressful experiences compared with those children who received conventional comforting touch (Kramer). Dr Larry Dossey has documented research on healing and psychological states such as meditation and prayer in Healing Words (Harper Collins, 1993). What a healer does The technique can be used for any condition affecting the client at any level of mind, body, emotions and spirit. It is A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 209 [Page 210](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/216?q1=directories) not necessary for the healee to have any religious beliefs for healing to be effective but in order to get the maximum benefits, the healee should be willing to deal with any unconscious material which may emerge. Reported improvements vary; some may experience a major health improvement, some may feel more able to cope, feel calmer and have an improved quality of life, while others in the terminal stage of disease may use healing to cope with the process of dying with peace and dignity. Some healers apply direct touch, and some work with auras - the energy field surrounding the client; some use both methods. The healer will be sensing where there are imbalances and breaks in the body's flow of energy. Healing can be applied either in a sitting or lying down position and can be as short as ten minutes or as long as an hour depending on the healer and the circumstances. Some healers also combine healing with the use of crystals or coloured lights. Some form of counselling or psychotherapy may be involved in interpreting the images which may have arisen for the healee during the healing, though this may be dependant on the experience and qualifications of the healer. The healee may experience a variety of sensations during a healing session: heaviness of the limbs, pins and needles, sleepiness or relaxation. Most healees are very relaxed afterwards and care should be taken not to get up too quickly. During the time that healing sessions are taking place, detoxification will be taking place and it is important to drink a lot of fluids to assist the body with this process. Healing needs to happen in a relaxed and loving environment. There needs to be an affinity between healer and healee for healing to work and if this doesn't happen they may need to be referred to someone else. It is important to note that if an individual doesn't respond to a healer, it is not necessarily the technique or the healer him/herself which is to blame. Sometimes, for instance, healers say that an individual will need specifically male or female energy. Therepeutic touch Therapeutic touch, developed in the sixties in the US, is essentially the same as spiritual healing but uses far more secular terminology. Jean Sayre-Adams, its leading exponent in the US describes it thus: \"Human beings do not have energy fields, they are energy fields. Humans and the environment are continually, simultaneously, and mutually exchanging energy. The environment refers to everything exterior to humans, including other people.\" Therapeutic touch works on the principle that human beings are energy fields and that imbalances and breaks in the flow of this energy can be corrected by a trained practitioner who can sense where there is depletion. The therapist draws energy from the environment through his or her body or from other areas in the patient where there is congestion, and directs it into the area where it is lacking. When symmetry has been restored to the field, which allows the body to work towards wholeness again, the practitioner's work is done. Finding a healer The National Federation of Spiritual Healers is the principal professional body for healers in the UK. While it is not associated with any religion, it does see the source of healing as divine but leaves it up to individuals to interpret that as they wish. Members of the NFSH are bound by a strict code of conduct. Besides providing details of local healers on request the NFSH functions as an information centre, aiming to publicise healing to a wider public. It organises lectures, provides interviews and articles for the media and participates with doctors in research programmes into the effects of healing on certain illnesses. The aim of the NFSH is for healing to be fully accepted by the public. They wish it to be available not only directly on request but through the NHS. Healing does enjoy a large degree of support from the medical establishment. Many doctors employ healers in their practices or refer their patients to healers. Dr Fleur Fisher who heads the Ethics and Information department of the British Medical Association has acknowledged the benefits of healing and supported its integration into the health service.

It may provide both symptom relief and an improved level of health and vitality. A huge body of knowledge about herbal treatment has existed for thousands of years in many cultures. Egyptian documentation dated around 1,500 BC survives detailing 700 medicines derived from plants. In 400 BC the Greek physician, Theophrastus, produced a textbook which was used for hundreds of years after his death. In Europe the knowledge of plants and herbs was passed down both orally by village women and in monasteries and convents. The advent of printing helped to spread this knowledge, with several herbal texts being published in the seventeenth century. As with Chinese herbs, remedies have been tried and tested over thousands of years, so although 210 A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES [Page 211](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/217?q1=directories) clinical research into herbalism remains in its infancy, the efficacy and possible toxicities of these remedies is well established. How herbal medicine works While orthodox medicine uses many extracts from plants used by herbalists in treating disease - digitalis extracted from foxglove and aspirin from the willow tree are well-known - herbal practitioners insist on the importance of using the whole herb, rather than extracts. Some herbal practitioners argue that the side-effects of orthodox treatment are increased when individual constituents are isolated and given as medication and that plants have a delicate chemical balance whereby their various constituents work together to promote maximum healing and avoid toxicity. As herbalism is a holistic therapy which takes account of the whole person, patients will be prescribed herbal treatment not only for their presenting symptoms, but in accordance with their overall health, taking diet, lifestyle, and exercise into account. Consequently the same presenting condition may be treated entirely differently in different people. The aim is to restore the body's vital energy, and to help it find its own self-healing mechanism. The emphasis is on strengthening the system rather than on attacking the disease. Nevertheless, although herbal treatment is not a 'magic bullet' cure, most herbalists reckon that if someone feels better in the first two to three weeks of treatment, s/he will probably respond well in the longer term. The philosophy of herbalism is to treat 'gently over a longer time'. Small doses of strong herbs can be given and tolerated, as the whole herb is used, with its own balance of constituents to counteract any possible toxicity. For instance, the National Institute of Medical Herbalists notes that the Chinese herb ma huang (ephedra sinica) yields ephedrine, an alkaloid which will raise blood pressure if given as an extracted drug. In the whole plant there are six other alkaloids, the main one of which actually prevents a rise in blood pressure and an increase in the heart rate. Dandelion leaves, which act as a diuretic, naturally contain the potassium which has to be given as a supplement with orthodox diuretic treatments. Herbal remedies in HIV There are three main functions of herbal treatment depending on the patient's symptoms: elimination and detoxification, health maintenance (where disease symptoms are counteracted) the body's defences are stimulated and stress is relieved, and finally the toning and nourishment of the body. The emphasis, as in the treatment of all diseases, is on strengthening the system, rather than attacking the disease. Fasting is sometimes advised for detoxification; this, however, needs to be tailored to suit the individual. Cleavers (goosegrass) is useful for promoting detoxification when fasting. Elderflower is used in sweating therapy. Milkthistle and dandelion root are used because they are thought to help the liver with detoxification, while milk thistle may strengthen the membrane of the liver's cells. When treating HIV/AIDS care needs to be taken when considering the stimulation of the body's defence system. Echinacea is often used by herbalists as an immune stimulator but if immune reserves are low, which is usually the case with HIV-positive people, this herb is too strong. Echinacea is not used by herbalists to treat people whose CD4 counts have fallen below 200. The role of polysaccharides - chains of sugars present in some plants - in stimulating without damaging the immune system is being researched in the US, Japan, and Switzerland. Many of the plant derived compounds listed in the A-Z of plant-derived medicines are polysaccharides. Herbal treatment has been successfully used to treat various common HIV-related conditions: tea tree oil is effective for some forms of fungal infection, as is garlic; sage has proved useful for night sweats, slippery elm for relieving diarrhoea, thuya for warts. As both herbs and knowledge about their use is fairly accessible, herbal treatment lends itself to self-help for less serious conditions. The 'materia medica', or list of herbal remedies contained in herbal books, will give dosages, but people with HIV are better advised to see a professional herbalist to work out an overall programme. There is a danger that by using off-the-shelf remedies people will be more likely to experience adverse reactions, since these may contain unpredictable amounts of the herb, and adverse reactions are probably more likely to occur with self-medication. Combining with other therapies Herbalism combines well with most therapies apart from homoeopathy or traditional Chinese medicine where the remedies could interact badly. It also combines well with orthodox treatment. Quality control If harvesting in the wild, herbs should be picked just before they flower. Variation in strength is not usually a problem as the whole plant is used, giving a balanced formula. Herbs are best bought from people who are known to have growing skills, and supplied by manufacturers who will test them. They are subject to the Trades Descriptions Act. It is important to ensure that any self-gathered herbs have been correctly gathered; the National Institute of Medical Herbalists advises that many cases of poisoning and adverse reaction are a consequence of misidentification.

SHomoeopathy Homoeopathy is a form of medicine which uses like to cure like. That is to say, the homoeopathic doctor prescribes for a sick person minute doses of a substance which in a crude, undiluted form would produce in a healthy person effects similar to those occurring in the disease. For example, the drug gelsemium produces symptoms in healthy people very much like those seen in influenza. Gelsemium, when used in appropriate doses, is said by homoeopaths to have an excellent record in the treatment of influenza. Homoeopathy approaches the symptoms of a disease in a very different way from orthodox medicine. The drugs prescribed by orthodox physicians are intended to control symptoms, which are seen as the problem in itself. For instance, pain caused by inflammation can be reduced by an anti-inflammatory drug which blocks the production of prostaglandin. Breathlessness and wheezing in asthmatics can be reduced by a drug which relaxes the tiny muscles within the walls of the airways. But these drugs are not directed at the cause of the illness; they turn off the symptoms without necessarily dealing with the cause. Homoeopathy views symptoms as a cure in process, an attempt by the individual's constitution to return to a state of health and well-being. The homoeopath seeks to prescribe a remedy which will assist this process, rather than suppressing the symptoms. In making a diagnosis, a homoeopath will take into account the smallest variation of symptoms, such as whether the symptoms worsen at specific times of day or with changes of temperature in the surrounding environment. The homoeopath will also note any emotional changes, and even dreaming may on occasion be significant. All these factors contribute to an overall symptom picture which expresses the individuality of the patient's complaint. The homoeopath then seeks to match this symptom picture with the symptom pictures which were observed when homoeopathic remedies were administered to healthy volunteers in experiments known as 'provings'. The homoeopath will also use past observations of the effects of remedy in other patients to make a prescription. The outcome is a highly individualised prescription. Two patients suffering from apparently similar symptoms may be prescribed very different remedies because of subtle differences in their symptoms. This reflects the highly individual responses to illness we all have. Sometimes the remedy prescribed will have no effect, because the homoeopath has failed to match the symptom picture with the right remedy, or because the homoeopath did not have the information which would have enabled a correct diagnosis. Or it may be that the remedy was not prescribed in a high enough potency to have the necessary effect. Homoeopathic remedies Homoeopathic remedies come from plant, animal and mineral sources. Only very tiny doses are used, because one of the founding fathers of homoeopathy discovered that highly diluted medicines can still have potent effects. Homoeopathically prescribed remedies are often talked about as being tiny microdoses of an original base substance. Although this is true in part, it would be inaccurate to describe homoeopathy as a chemical therapy. Homoeopathic medicines are potentised. This means that they are diluted in water and then shaken vigourously in the presence of light. This process of dilution and shaking is repeated until, by the laws of chemistry, no traces of the original medicinal substance can remain. Paradoxically, each successive dilution and shaking appears to increase the potency of the remedy. It is thought by homoeopaths that during this process, information patterns continue to be held in the water molecules, and upon dissolving on the tongue, the molecular information contained in the tablet is passed into the body. It has been suggested that this process of dilution and shaking increases the intensity of the electromagnetic field of the substance. If the electromagnetic field of the remedy resonates at the same frequency as the electromagnetic field of the person who receives the remedy, it will provide an energetic impetus that enables the individual to overcome the symptoms for which they are being treated. Although the benefits of using homoeopathy are undeniable and well documented, the notion of energy resonance is far from being understood or accepted in the scientific world. Homoeopathy has tended to draw particular scepticism from scientists because the way it is thought to work is still difficult to explain within the limits of current scientific knowledge. It would probably be fair to say that scientific research is still attempting to come up with an explanation for how homoeopathy works. Nevertheless, the benefits of homoeopathic treatment have been proven in some diseases. Clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the benefit of homoeopathic remedies when compared with a placebo. Some scientists have argued that homoeopathy is just a very powerful placebo effect, but several trials have shown that the health of people who received a homoeopathic remedy for a condition improved when compared with those who received a placebo. Homoeopathic remedies have also been used on animals such as horses, dogs and cats with success, indicating that homoeopathy is not a placebo effect. Several studies have demonstrated that homoeopathic dilutions of particular substances do induce measurable effects in human cells in the laboratory. For instance, potentised doses of histamine and crushed bee had a significant effect on reducing the secretion of allergy-causing chemicals from basophils, white blood cells which play a role in allergic responses. Homoeopathic doses of silica have been shown to stimulate macrophages (immune cells which engulf bacteria) in mice. 212 A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES [Page 213](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/219?q1=directories) The homoeopathic view of AIDS and its treatment Few homoeopaths in the UK have experience of treating people with HIV or AIDS. These observations are based on the views of those who have treated a large number of patients. Broadly speaking, there are two approaches amongst homoeopaths to AIDS and the ways in which it should be treated. One adheres strictly to the methods of classical homoeopathy, and takes the view that AIDS-related illness can be treated with a series of remedies appropriate to the constitution of the individual and their pattern of symptoms. If the remedies are well-chosen, it should not be necessary to adjust diet or provide psychological counselling. The homoeopath will treat the central and most pressing symptoms first, whether these are physical problems such as night sweats or emotional reactions such as shock or fear. When these symptoms have been dealt with attention is paid to other, less intrusive symptoms. There is no firm evidence that this approach has been successful, but some homoeopaths claim a degree of success with some AIDS-related symptoms such as night sweats, fatigue and nausea, saying that they have been relieved. The other view held by homoeopathic practitioners is that AIDS is a consequence of an overloaded immune system in which HIV is merely one factor leading to immune deficiency. As a consequence, the homoeopath must prescribe remedies which address the range of factors which have led to immune deficiency and the specific opportunistic infections developed by individuals. A single remedy is unlikely to resolve the dis-ease. In some cases, this might involve the prescription of remedies designed to alleviate the effects of long-term use of recreational drugs, or a history of sexually transmitted disease. Some homoeopaths say that it is often when the damage caused by these factors is addressed that they see improvement in opportunistic infections or constitutional symptoms such as night sweats and weight loss. Once again, there is no firm evidence in the form of research studies that this approach has been successful in HIV-positive people, but several homoeopaths specialising in the treatment of HIV-positive people say that they have had success treating some AIDS-related illnesses using this method. Some homoeopaths claim that they can provide remedies which vaccinate or prophylax against specific infections, but those we spoke to strongly dispute this claim, pointing out that there is no evidence from properly controlled studies to support this view. Homoeopathic treatment pays equal attention to physical and emotional symptom and homoeopaths say that remedies for fear, shock, anxiety, depression and compulsive thoughts have shown good effects in many people over the years, suggesting that homoeopathy may provide benefit on the emotional level to people confronting a diagnosis of HIV infection or AIDS. Although this is an aspect of homoeopathy that draws particular suspicion from some doctors, it is one that deserves further study, given the frequently addictive nature of anti-depressant drugs. Homoeopathy and other treatments Most homoeopaths take the view that conventional medications will interfere with the ability of homoeopathic remedies to improve a condition. Their use will certainly make it more difficult to tell whether the homoeopathic remedy has been responsible for any improvement in the patient's condition. \"Superficial\" medicines such as antihistamines, sudafed, steroids, paracetamol and aspirin are thought to negate the effects of remedies, but so are some of the drugs used specifically to treat HIV infection, such as AZT. Attitudes differ amongst homoeopaths as to the likelihood of success of homoeopathic remedies used alongside the medications customarily used in HIV positive people. Some homoeopaths have attempted to negate the side-effects of AZT by prescribing potentised doses of the drug whilst patients continue to use it, but they say that there is no clear evidence that this reduces the side-effects. This is a controversial area amongst homoeopaths, and few use such methods. A homoeopath experienced in treating injecting drug users told NAM that homoeopathic remedies seem to be ineffective in drug users who are in the process of withdrawing from drug use, because body chemistry is disrupted during this period. Other complementary therapies which are said to work on the basis of altering the body's energy may interfere with homoeopathic treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine is one example. Other therapies which are concerned with dietary changes, stress reduction and physical manipulation will not interfere with the effects of homoeopathic remedies. Visiting a homoeopath A homoeopath will take a detailed medical history. This may not be quite the same as the form of history taken by a doctor. You will be asked about your symptoms, but you will also be asked about your past illnesses and about your habits and reactions to particular situations. This is to enable the homoeopath to build up a picture of your constitution and disposition which is holistic, taking into account your physical and emotional reactions. The homoeopath will then refer to the repertory, which contains lists of symptoms together with remedies suitable for those symptoms. These descriptions may be very specific. For instance, homoeopaths classify headaches not only according to where the pain is, but also at what times of day it is worst and what other forms of behaviour and sensation accompany the headache. Homoeopaths have arrived at these indications for use as result of provings, experiments done in healthy individuals to examine what symptoms are produced by the administration of the crude form of a herb or mineral. Individuals participating in the proving experiments were asked to note any physical and emotional symptoms, no matter how minor, to build a symptom picture of the remedy. Considerations in choosing a homoeopath Homoeopaths are trained in several different ways. Some receive a conventional medical training and subsequently become homoeopaths. The length of their homoeopathic training may vary considerably. Non-medical homoeopaths A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 213 [Page 214](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/220?q1=directories) usually receive three or four years training at a college of homoeopathy. There are big differences from one homoeopath to another in their level of knowledge about the symptoms and the disease course associated with HIV and AIDS. There are also big differences in their knowledge of homoeopathic remedies. Ask the homoeopath how he or she keeps up to date on AIDS and the use of homoeopathy in AIDS. A number of organisations, including HEAL, the Letchworth Centre for Complementary Medicine and the Faculty of Homoeopaths provide some training on the use of homoeopathy in AIDS. Homoeopaths experienced in treating HIV-positive people can also be found through the Immune Development Trust and HEAL. Homoeopaths also differ in other ways, regardless of their training. Some will use classical methods alone, others will use a combination of remedies and will also offer advice on diet, stress reduction and lifestyle. They may also practice other complementary therapies, such as acupuncture.

SHypnotherapy Hypnotherapy induces a trance-like state during which the person is so deeply relaxed that the unconscious becomes accessible to suggestion. Hypnotherapy can therefore be used either to reduce or eliminate symptoms, or to assist psychological treatment, so that the therapist can explore the unconscious mind. It is unclear exactly how hypnosis works; the hypnotic state appears to exist somewhere in the hinterland between wakefulness and the unconscious. While the hypnotic technique is relatively modern, dating from the work of Franz Anton Mesmer in the eighteenth century, there is evidence of hypnotism, or the induction of trance-like states, being used in ancient Egypt, Greece and by the Druids in Britain. Hypnotism aroused great interest during the 19th century, but fell into increasing disrepute in the 20th century due to its reputation as a stage curiosity and its consequent association with quackery. A typical hypnotherapy session During a session the patient/client will sit or lie, either in a chair or on a couch, and will be taken through a series of relaxation exercises by the hypnotherapist who will rely on his/her voice to effect a relaxed state. While it is no longer usual for objects to be dangled before the patient, this is perfectly acceptable if this is what seems necessary and fits with the patient's expectations. It may be useful to check with the therapist what images he or she will conjure up; Nursing Times recently reported the story of a woman who was asked to imagine herself in a field of corn and had an attack of hay fever! Hypnotists claim that the power of suggestion is enough to produce allergic reactions to imaginary objects. Once a hypnotic state has begun the client will be gently probed to recall memories which may shed light on the problem in hand. The therapeutic relationship is all-important as trust is an essential prerequisite in order for this therapy to be effective. The ability to relax fully and so take best advantage of hypnosis may vary from person to person. The number of sessions will differ according to this and to the extent of the presenting problems. Individuals can also be taught self-hypnosis techniques akin to visualisation which many people report to be of great benefit. Hypnotherapy's potential for reducing both stress levels and pain make it a useful tool for achieving an enhanced quality of life when living with HIV. It also has a good record of helping to end addictions. Some people report that hypnotherapy has helped control complaints such as incontinence, and there is evidence from well-controlled clinical trials that hypnotherapy treatment for certain forms of pain is successful. It has also been credited with improving the breathing of asthmatics (Evans; Colosimo; James). Hypnotherapy has also proved to be useful in controlling nausea. A study which compared children between the ages of 10 and 18 receiving chemotherapy found that those taught self-hypnosis and relaxation vomited less (two-thirds did not vomit at all) and were able to maintain a higher fluid intake than the children who did not receive instruction in the technique (Cotanch). Finding a practitioner Whilst there are many reputable hypnotherapists, this is a field which tends to attract confidence tricksters and the unqualified hoping to make money. Anyone can claim to be a hypnotherapist and there are nearly 100 hypnotherapist organisations.

It is an excellent way of reducing stress and increasing a generalised sense of well-being. There are many different sorts of massage, and practitioners are likely to specialise in one or two forms. These are some of the main types you are likely to encounter: * aromatherapy massage * biodynamic massage * holistic massage * massage with aromatherapy oils * shiatsu * sports massage * Swedish massage * therapeutic massage Swedish massage tends to be the basis of most approaches to massage. It involves a number of manual techniques aimed to relax, strengthen and stimulate the muscles. Holistic massage is a term used for massage that addresses the whole person - mind, body and emotions. The majority of masseurs will tend to take a holistic approach, apart from sports injury massage, which focuses only on the physical body. Therapeutic massage on the other hand looks at more than the physical body. For example, if the practitioner detects tension in certain parts of your body, this may lead to a discussion of why you have been feeling tense and how emotions could be seen to be stored in tense muscle. Biodynamic massage is massage without oils, applying a pressure-point style of touch using a stethoscope to listen to the body's responses. Massage with aromatherapy oils usually means that the therapist is a not a qualified aromatherapist, but has experience of using gentle oils such as lavendar, mandarin and geranium. The benefits of massage Quite a lot is now known about the way that massage affects the body, but most people who receive massage report that the benefits are very clear: it usually induces a sense of relaxation through enabling us to breathe deeply and slowly, and it slows the heart rate. It is also pleasurable to be touched. This can be particularly important for people who feel stigmatised, lonely or isolated as a result of their physical or emotional state of health. Touch provides a tangible sense of reassurance and support, and also helps reduce anxiety and calm the mind. In the process of relaxation many claim to be 'more in touch' with their emotional and physical state of health and begin to identify factors such as stress that are undermining their health. Massage is applied to the muscle and ligaments, relaxing the nervous system, imrpoving circulation, stimulating the flow of oxygen-bearing red blood cells around the body and assisting in the elimination of toxins. Massage has been helpful in restoring strength and mobility after injury or weight loss. A good practitioner will be able to adapt techniques for people confined to bed or to a wheelchair to help maintain muscular tone and blood circulation. When to avoid massage Contra-indications to massage include thrombosis, varicose veins, verrucaes and athlete's foot. With infectious or contagious skin conditions the immediate area should be avoided by the therapist. Stimulation of the lymphatic system is not recommended for people with KS. Although there is no clear proof, some doctors suspect that KS could spread through the lymph system. Combination with other therapies Massage can be combined with other therapies quite easily; indeed some forms of treatment such as traditional Chinese medicine and naturopathy may include massage as part of an attempt to clear toxins from the body. It is probably wise to let your masseur know of any other treatments you are receiving. What a good massage should involve Your first massage should involve a discussion with your masseur. The discussion or assessment will focus on what you hope to get from the massage, and you shouldn't be surprised if your masseur also asks for a brief medical history. Such a discussion could last thirty minutes or more before the massage actually takes place. It is standard practice that an all-over massage will take about an hour to complete. Getting the form of massage you want will often depend on voicing your needs, and also depends on your previous experience of massage. Some people rate a good massage as being very firm or even hard. Whilst such a massage might be appropriate for well-toned muscles, it might not be what you need or want, especially if you are suffering from exhaustion. Make sure you discuss this with your masseur before the massage begins. Many people connect massage with sexual activity, but most professionally qualified masseurs see themselves as part of the health and therapy sector, not the sex industry. Masseurs are used to dealing tactfully with sexual arousal as a consequence of massage, so you shouldn't be A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 215 [Page 216](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/222?q1=directories) embarrassed by the possibility. If, on the other hand, you feel that your masseur is making unwelcome sexual advances, you shouldn't be embarrassed about complaining, especially if the massage service is provided by a support group. Finding a masseur There are many different forms of qualifications and training available for massage, but the best known is the ITEC certificate. Massage services are often available through support groups and HIV centres. Naturopathy Naturopathy is a drug-free healing system based on the principle that the body has an inate ability to heal itself. Naturopaths may use dietary adjustments, fasting, sweating, exercise, osteopathy and stress management to treat people. Naturopaths believe that there is a natural equilibrium and harmony towards which the body will strive and its inherent power to do this is expressed as the body's 'vital force'; this idea of a vital force crops up in various complementary and alternative therapies, notably in traditional Chinese medicine and it is the basis of naturopathic philosophy. The body's equilibrium can be disturbed by a build-up of toxins, resulting in disease. Disease is seen from the naturopathic point of view as the body's attempt to eliminate toxins and to restore equilibrium or balance. Naturopathy's concern is the holistic treatment of an individual; it does not only seek to address symptoms but to resolve the underlying causes of illness, bearing in mind the age, constitution, past medical history, mental, emotional and hereditary factors of the individual. Naturopaths will often be trained and will practise as osteopaths. The origins of naturopathy The history of the nature cure, as naturopathy has often been known, goes far back to the ancient Greek doctors Hippocrates and Aesculapius, whose success with natural therapy became legendary. Although naturopathy as a system is relatively new, its basic concepts date back to the laws of health laid down by Hippocrates in 400 BC. These are expressed as follows:* Only nature heals, providing it has the opportunity to do so; * Let food be your medicine and let medicine be your food; * Disease is an expression of purification; * All disease is one (i.e. resulting from the same cause, a build up of toxins in the body). Naturopathy as we know it today was formalised during the 19th century by practitioners working in the US, using hydrotherapy and 'hygienics'. Around the turn of the century naturopathic ideas were embodied in the health-farm movement in Britain, while in 1902 Benedict Lust set up the American School of Naturopathy in New York. Naturopathic techniques Naturopaths will take a full case history, taking the whole person into account; this will entail looking at the presenting condition, diet, lifestyle, substance abuse, medical history and medication. They are trained in clinical pathology and will diagnose similarly to orthodox medicine, often asking for blood or other medical tests. When treating serious illness, they may wish to work jointly with the patient's doctor as they perceive orthodox medicine as having a wider range of effective diagnostic tools. Naturopathy views acute illness as a natural healing or cleansing process manifested by colds, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, skin rashes etc. These are seen as positive processes by which the body detoxifies itself and brings about a restoration of health. It is the suppression of acute illness that may result in chronic ill-health. Naturopathy's cornerstone is elimination and the tools used to encourage this include: * Diet, based largely on wholefoods and fresh fruit and vegetables, preferably organically produced * Fasting * Hydrotherapy using hot and cold sprays or compresses * Physical therapy and osteopathic treatment * Exercise and breathing techniques * Stress management The naturopath sees the relationship with the patient as a partnership; responsibility needs to be taken by the patient to effect positive changes in his/her lifestyle. The naturopath's job is to encourage the body's vital healing force to eliminate the toxic build-up of cellular metabolic wastes which have accumulated due to inadequate elimination via the bowels, skin, kidneys, liver and lungs. This elimination may be evidenced by colds, flu-like symptoms, fever, diarrhoea or vomiting. These symptoms are described as a 'healing crisis' and viewed naturopathically as positive reactions when they occur in moderation. Naturopaths say that treatment gives rise to the following phenomena: * A progressive improvement in general health, punctuated by healing crises; * A return of previous symptoms, particularly ones that were suppressed with orthodox medication, usually in reverse order of their first appearance; * The disease process moves from deeper tissues to more superficial ones, and from vital organs to the less vital. Naturopathy and HIV/AIDS There is some variation amongst naturopaths as to how HIV is defined but generally it is seen as an immune dysfunction; so one of the aims may be to help modulate the immune system so it can deal more effectively with HIV and opportunistic infections. The approach may thus be less concerned with cleansing and more on building up the constitution. Historically, HIV/AIDS is a new condition and naturopaths acknowledge the need to accept their limitations and to 216 A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES [Page 217](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/223?q1=directories) exercise great caution when treating an HIV-positive person. Treatment is individually tailored and no claims are made. The aim however is no different to any other condition: the restoration and/or maintenance of health and vitality with minimum drug intervention. The fundamental guide to all therapy is 'above all, do no harm'. This guiding principle allows the flexibility necessary when approaching the treatment of a condition as serious as AIDS, where patients may wish to carry on taking allopathic drugs such as prophylaxis against PCP. However, a better state of health may help offset opportunistic infections too. Changes may be necessary to traditional naturopathic advice: raw foods, for instance, may be kept to a minimum owing to the danger of parasites and of opportunistic infections from the soil. Fasting is also generally contra-indicated as the constitution is likely to be too weak. Dietary advice can be given, as can advice on vitamin supplementation. Initially two to three sessions will be needed over four to twelve weeks. It should then be possible to lengthen the intervals between sessions, with the patient returning only for further advice and monitoring of treatment. Naturopathy aims to give people the tools to achieve health, and the information about how to use these tools in accordance with well-established naturopathic principles. Good feedback is necessary for the practitioner in what is ideally a two-way process. The naturopath may look at ways of relieving stress and may recommend exercises, psycho-therapy, yoga or massage. Naturopathy combines well with most other therapies. Accreditation and training Anyone can call themselves a naturopath so it is important to check that a practitioner has completed an approved four year course at the British College of Naturopathy and Osteopathy (BCNO) where anatomy, physiology and pathology take up much of the curriculum. The college can be contacted at the address of the British Naturopathic Association. Contacts The British Naturopathic Association Frazer House, 6, Netherhall Gardens, London NW3 5RR This is the main professional body in this country. The General Council and Register of Naturopaths The Council keeps a register of practitioners, who use the initials MRN after their name. The register has a code of ethics, provides insurance and insists on proper four year training at an approved college. Free treatment can be obtained through the Immune Development Trust or at the BCNO where students will see members of the public as part of their training. As with most therapies, people with HIV are likely to find good practitioners with experience of HIV through organisations like the Immune Development Trust. Books Naturopathic medicine: treating the whole person Roger Newman Turner (Thorsons, 1990) * Osteopathy Osteopathy is a manipulative therapy which seeks to correct structural dysfunctions in the body, and resulting health problems, through working on the body's musculoskeletal system. Like naturopathy, osteopathy sees the body as possessing a natural tendency to strive towards a healthy equilibrium. If its balance is disturbed by mechanical dysfunctions in its structure, then its healing abilities will be impaired. Much attention is given to the spinal column and the healthy functioning of the central nervous system which it protects; if a lesion - the osteopathic term for a mechanical fault in a joint - occurs in the spine, its correction may well sort out other connected health problems. Osteopaths claim their treatment can improve the functioning of the nervous system, blood circulation and lymphatic drainage. Osteopathy does not claim that structural dysfunction is the only cause of ill-health, recognising the role played by other factors such as diet, psychological causes, environment and heredity. As a holistic therapy, it seeks to treat the whole person, not just the presenting symptoms. Visiting an osteopath A full history will be taken and a physical examination given. Diagnosis begins the moment the individual walks into the practice; movement, skin colour, breathing and posture will all be assessed. Investigation into the cause of the presenting symptoms will involve a thorough assessment of muscle tone and temperature and joint movement. The symptoms may well be some distance from the area being examined, such as when numbness or tingling, frequently emanating from the neck, is experienced in the hands. Sometimes x-rays may be requested. Having established that the problem is structural, treatment will be given. The patient sits or lies on a table in the best position for the practitioner to perform manipulation which may include high velocity thrusts, or clicks as they are popularly known. These are designed to free up joints which have become misaligned, sometimes over a long period of time. They can seem alarming but usually only involve a minimum of discomfort; occasionally the patient may feel a bruised sensation for a day or so following treatment. Some conditions may respond to soft tissue work alone. Whilst many people report that osteopathy has been of great benefit in relieving backpain, it is also claimed to be able to alleviate many other conditions such as migraine. The number of sessions required will vary from one or two, to regular treatment over a period of months for chronic conditions. Osteopaths are often qualified in other areas of complementary therapy such as naturopathy or homoeopathy and can give advice in these disciplines as well. When to avoid osteopathy Osteopathy is contra-indicated for certain conditions. Because it involves a degree of force, great care is indicated when osteoporosis is present, when bones are brittle or joints inflamed. It can therefore be inappropriate when rheumatoid arthritis is present, especially as this A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 217 [Page 218](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/224?q1=directories) condition arises from auto-immunity, rather than from structural dysfunction. Osteopathy is also contra-indicated during the early weeks of pregnancy. Osteopaths advise against combining the treatment with physiotherapy or chiropractic as these physically based therapies could conflict with osteopathic treatment. Osteopathy is said to combine fairly well with the Alexander technique and sometimes with acupuncture, though osteopaths caution against over-treating as the body can become stressed and may not have sufficient reserves to cope with a number of different therapies at once. Cranial osteopathy Some osteopaths specialise in cranial osteopathy. It is a much gentler therapy, where the practitioner works with the cranial rhythmic impulse perceptible in the circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid in which the brain and the spinal cord lie. This rhythm is clearest at the cranium and the sacrum and has a pumping effect on the circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid in the spine and the brain. It is thought that by manipulating the skull, the body's vitality can be enhanced. Treatment involves lying on a table while the practitioner gently manipulates the skull, neck, diaphragm and sacrum. Cranial osteopaths can diagnose from the cranial rhythm if the body's vitality is low and much of the treatment is dedicated to restoring this. The treatment is very relaxing and so non-invasive as to require a certain act of faith as to its efficacy. Many people experience it as similar to healing; it certainly involves a close therapeutic relationship with the practitioner. The large amount of anecdotal evidence suggests that its claims are not imaginary however, and conditions as wide-ranging as depression, insomnia, headaches and asthma have been said to benefit. Cranial osteopaths are trained in classical osteopathy and can provide the more robust high velocity thrusts if necessary. HIV and osteopathy Osteopaths are intensely aware of the role stress plays in the body, both in relation to posture and to the body's ability to heal itself. Cranial osteopathy is said to be successful in treating stress-related conditions such as depression, anxiety and insomnia. Osteopaths are cautious in their approach and will always recommend another therapy if they feel it to be more suitable. Alternately, if no progress is being made or a relapse occurs they are likely to re-refer the patient to the doctor. Recurrent chest pains, neck pains and problems with swallowing, breathing and with the bowel function are all amenable to improvement from osteopathic intervention. The improved circulation and nerve function that can result from osteopathy may enhance the body's vitality. Some osteopaths think that night sweats may be alleviated when treatment is aimed at restoring the balance between the sympathetic and para-sympathetic nervous system. Improvement may well be expressed through 'healing crises'. This may involve an over-working of the sinuses, fevers and high temperatures and swollen glands. In women there may be increased uterine bleeding. These all need constant monitoring. In a residential setting fevers can be relieved with hydrotherapy, the application of cold and hot water to the body. Many practitioners will operate a sliding price scale, or will treat individuals for what they can afford. Treatment is sometimes available at GP's practices. Finding a practitioner Practitioners can be found through the Register of Osteopaths. They should be supportive and caring; have tact with the opposite sex with matters such as undressing; they should be able to make the patient feel comfortable, neither traumatised or invaded. Complaints are usually due to misunderstandings about treatment; one practitioner gave the example of correcting the position of the coccyx. This may need to be carried out from the inside of the rectum and needs explaining carefully to the patient. Training and accreditation Osteopathic training takes four years; there are four main schools, one of which runs a 13 month course for qualified doctors. Cranial osteopathy is now taught at undergraduate level alongside classical osteopathy. Post-graduate specialist courses are available in subjects such as anatomy, physiology and sports injuries. In 1995 the General Osteopathic Council will be set up and will regulate the profession by statute, following the passing of the Osteopathy Act in 1993, making osteopathy the first complementary therapy to gain this status. Contacts There are several different registers of practitioners, the oldest and largest being: The General Council and Register of Osteopaths 56 London Street, Reading, Berkshire RG1 48Q This encompasses about three-quarters of the profession.

The British Naturopathy and Osteopathy Association 6 Netherhall Gardens, London NW3 5RR * Reflexology Reflexology, or reflex zone therapy as it is sometimes known, is a system of manipulation of pressure points in the feet. It is believed that by stimulating these points, the body's own healing mechanisms can be mobilised. Particular areas of the body, usually the feet or hands, are seen as a map of zones which correspond to, or are linked to, other structures or organs of the body through a flow of energy. Disease or damage in one part of the body will show up in the corresponding zone on the foot and can be favourably influenced by careful massage or pressure on that zone. 218 A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES [Page 219](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/225?q1=directories) The origins of reflexology Although reflexology in its current form has only been practised in the UK since the 1960's, there is evidence of the use of foot massage in many primitive and ancient cultures. Wall paintings have been found in Egypt, and foot massage is said to have been used therapeutically by native Americans. In the early part of this century, in the USA, an ear, nose and throat specialist, Dr. William Fitzgerald, noticed that pressure on parts of the nose resulted in some local anaesthesia, and on investigating further through the body he was eventually able to map out which parts of the body corresponded to others, calling his discoveries 'zone therapy'. How a refllexologist practises The body is said to be divided into ten vertical zones; structures and organs along these zones are connected by energy flows to areas on the foot which function as terminals for the entire zone. Pressure on a zone in the foot will stimulate various organs which are located along the same zone. There are further zones present in the body, enabling a sophisticated grid of reflex points for the entire body to be drawn up. Besides the taking of a detailed case history, practitioners diagnose state of health both through skin colour and condition, condition of bone structure and muscle tone and by careful pressure on the various reflex zones; pain may be experienced in a reflex zone if some disorder is present in an appropriate part of the body, though sometimes discomfort may be due merely to some current strain, rather than to organic disease. Treatment is gentle, relaxing and calming; while there may be some pain, this may be accompanied by a sense of well-being. Very rarely treatment might also make you sweat, but if it causes shivery feelings and coldness this could be due to over-stimulation and the practititioner should be informed straightaway. Some side-effects may be experienced in the days after treatment has commenced; these can take the form of mild diarrhoea, sweating, runny nose or increased passing of urine and are said to be due to increased elimination of toxins from the system. Disorders which are said to benefit from reflexology cover a very wide area and include acne, some allergic disorders, bowel and bladder problems, menstrual problems and pain. Caution should be exercised with circulatory disorders such as varicose veins. Reflexology and HIV The 'hands-on', calming effect of reflexology makes it an attractive option for people with HIV; it is useful for alleviating stress and the importance of touch should not be under-estimated for those who are dealing with a stigmatised condition. In relation to specific conditions, success has been reported with bone ache, neck stiffness and back ache though all these problems have a tendency to recur if treatment is not continued. Respiratory, circulatory, excretory and digestive problems have been helped, though it is important that excessive pressure on these systems is avoided. Insomnia has responded well to reflexology. Reflexologists will also work on zones which they believe can strengthen immune function. They will concentrate on the lymphatic and endocrine systems at all stages of treatment. They will treat the pituitary gland, the liver, the spleen, the ileocaecal valve (the junction between the small and large intestines) and the kidneys. The cleansing processes activated by reflexology, urinic or colonic, may cause some temporary disruption; there may be increased dreaming activity, mild temporary hair loss, deafness with full hearing being regained later, and skin rashes, although these side-effects are reportedly rare. Particular caution needs to be exercised by practitioners when treating people with PCP as treatment can cause an over-reaction; mucous is brought up but the process can go on without relief, further weakening the individual. It may sometimes be possible to combine reflexology with acupuncture, which sometimes has better results when treating conditions such as arthritis. Finding a competent practitioner Many professional bodies exist, usually attached to particular schools. Courses can vary from two years to a weekend. The most reliable organisation appears to be the Association of Reflexologists which functions as an umbrella organisation to register practitioners trained at approved schools, who have been in practice for two years and who have submitted two very full case histories. Their practitioners will have insurance. There is a reflexology division of the British Register of Complementary Practitioners. The British Reflexology Association registers graduates from the well-established Bayley School of Reflexology. Contacts Asssociation of Reflexologists 37 Standale Grove, Ruislip, Middlesex British Reflexology Association 12 Pond Road, London SE3 9JL Books Reflex Zone Massage Handbook of Therapy and Self-Help Franz Wagner (Thorsons) SShiatsu Shiatsu is a form of manipulation which developed in Japan and which combines many of the benefits of massage with those of acupuncture. Shiatsu is not the same as reflexology. The term means 'finger pressure' and shiatsu uses acupressure, the manipulation of acupuncture points with the fingers or different part of the hand. Treatment will be carried out with the patient lying or sitting on the floor, usually on a thick mat or futon. Treatment is applied through clothing and patients will be asked to wear light, baggy clothing. Practitioners usually commence treatment by relaxing the patient's body, then more specific procedures are applied. Pressure is applied in different ways to tonify the body by increasing the flow of blood and energy, to disperse and break up blockages or to counteract and calm agitations in the energy flow. Sometimes shiatsu massage can be quite vigorous and even mildly painful. Shiatsu claims to be effective in treating a large number of conditions which include headaches, migraine, respiratory A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 219 [Page 220](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/226?q1=directories) conditions such as asthma and bronchitis, sinus problems and catarrh, digestive and bowel disorders, circulatory problems and rheumatic and arthritic complaints. In particular, shiatsu is effective in treating stress and anxiety and related conditions such as insomnia. Like massage, shiatsu's close contact may give the patient a sense of reassurance and validation. Shiatsu practitoners say that a particular point on the inner side of the wrist can be used to relieve nausea, and experiments have taken place with special bands which can be used by individuals to apply pressure to this point when feeling nauseous. These experiments showed relief of nausea in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and pregnant women suffering from morning sickness. It is therefore likely that individuals may be able to use shiatsu to alleviate nauseous side-effects caused by AZT and other drugs. Shiatsu is contraindicated in patients who have a risk of haemorrhage, or thrombosis. This is because the treatment works by increasing blood flow. For this reason too it should be avoided when there is a tumour in the area to be treated. Because of the pressure involved, caution should also be exercised when osteoporosis, recent tissue damage, fractures or inflammation are present. Parts of the skull should be avoided where the patient suffers from epilepsy or high blood pressure. This list demonstrates the importance of giving your practitioner a very full and up-to-date medical history. After a session of Shiatsu, patients will probably feel relaxed with a sense of well-being. There may, however, be a temporary crisis while toxins and negative emotions are released; these may take the form of a headache or flu-like symptoms and it is important to contact the practitioner for reassurance. Shiatsu was introduced to the West in the 1970s; its professional body is the Shiatsu Society, established in 1981. It acts as an information centre for the public and keeps a register of members who are required to have completed a three year training. Different institutions teach different styles and philosophical approaches to Shiatsu and the society requires its members to train with two teachers who use other styles to the one they have studied.

It is a medical tradition which first began to be written down more than two and a half thousand years ago. It is still the main form of medical care used by nearly one and half billion people in the world. TCM uses a combination of herbs and acupuncture (the insertion of fine needles into certain points on the skin) to heal illness. Most of the remedies now in use by practitioners of TCM have been prescribed for hundreds of years, and a large body of knowledge has accumulated regarding their correct use and their potential side-effects. In comparison most Western drugs are extremely new. The origins of acupuncture are unknown but it has been practiced for at least five thousand years. Some say that acupuncture was discovered after it was noticed that arrow wounds in certain parts of the body caused the disappearance of long-term health problems. Today it is known that the points used by acupuncturists to insert needles are sites of heightened electrical conductivity and lowered resistance. Prehistoric healers seem to have learnt that by stimulating these points illness could be relieved and energy levels increased. They also discovered a form of energy, or qi, which flows through channels in the body known as meridians. These meridians link together organ systems. The qi is best understood as something more than an electrical impulse; it is the life force, \"that which differentiates life from death, animate from inanimate\", as the authors of Treating AIDS with Chinese Medicine put it. The insertion of needles into points along the meridians acts in the same way as throwing the switches in an electrical current; it encourages the flow of qi around the body to specific organs. Healers learnt to measure the strength of this energy and to detect whether there were imbalances of energy in meridians related to specific organs. In TCM illness is considered to be a consequence of an imbalance of energy in the body, which can come about due to external or internal factors. The task of the physician is to assist the patient in re-balancing the body's energies. To assess an individual's state of health, or energy balance, a practitioner of TCM will take a detailed case history using the tongue and pulses as important diagnostic tools. The flow of energy can be assessed by testing various body pulses. TCM also uses the concepts of yin and yang, which are sometimes translated as active and passive, positive and negative, masculine and feminine or light and shadow. Yin and yang encompasses all these meanings. TCM has a very different understanding of the organs and the substances of the body such as blood, fluids and its personality. Of all the forms of alternative medicine, TCM is the system which is most alien to a Western scientific, materialist view of the world. Many Western doctors have complained that the concepts used in TCM, such as Heat, Cold, Wind and Damp, bear no relation to the physical reality of the body as it has been described by Western science. TCM practitioners say that it is only in the field of quantum physics that scientists have begun to come up with explanations for energy-related phenomena such as qi which materialistic science finds impossible to quantify or explain. Chinese herbal medicine is used to treat deficiencies within the body and to clear disease causing factors such as 220 A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES [Page 221](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/227?q1=directories) Damp, Cold, Phlegm, Heat and the waste materials of the metabolism. Acupuncture is used to augment this medication. For instance, if a practitioner decides to give treatment for a kidney deficiency, acupuncture treatment will be given to enhance the effects of the herbs on the functioning of the kidney. Acupuncture is also used to treat structural problems, such as back or muscle pain, and to alleviate arthritis. Some practitioners see acupuncture as just as important as herbs or may use only acupuncture in their practice. There are a number of different theories in TCM about the nature of AIDS, all of which start with the invasion of an 'external evil'. However, there are different schools of thought about the deficiencies and disorders which occur in the body as a result of this 'invasion' and how these should be interpreted. This means that different practitioners of TCM may follow rather different treatment strategies for treatment depending on whether they view AIDS as a Warm disease, a Deficiency disease, a deficiency of Yin and Kidney, or a Heat-induced disorder. All are agreed that the external evil factor - HIV - will take the path of least resistance. It is therefore important to protect the areas of weakness at all times. Of all the complementary therapies, TCM is the one which has been subject to the greatest scientific scrutiny. Since the 1950s Chinese and Western scientists have sought to identify the active ingredients in traditional herbal medicines, and have tested them in clinical trials. In recent years there has been great progress in making Chinese and Western medicine truly complementary. For instance, Chinese doctors report considerably greater success in treating some forms of cancer using a combination of herbs plus Western medication and radiotherapy than with one method alone. In particular, some herbs appear to be very successful in reducing the toxicity of cancer chemotherapy. Chinese herbal medicines A wide range of Chinese herbs have been tested to observe their effects on the immune system and some of the herbs observed to have anti-viral effects have been tested to observe whether they kill HIV. In Chinese medical theory it is more important to know whether a herb can affect the body's ability to fight disease than it is to know whether the herb inhibits replication of a specific virus. This is because TCM takes the view that viruses and other external factors (such as bacteria, parasites and fungi) can only cause illness when the body's life force is depleted. Many of the herbs which have been shown to inhibit HIV infection appear to do so by enhancing the ability of cells to resist infection rather than by directly inhibiting the processes by which the virus reproduces itself. An example is violae yeodensitis, which cannot kill HIV outside the cell, but which does prevent HIV from infecting other cells in a laboratory cell line. How the herb might produce this effect is still unknown. Violae yeodensitis is commonly used as part of formulae to treat tuberculosis. A large number of herbs have now been documented as increasing T-cell counts, white blood cell counts and many other cell-mediated immune functions in animal studies and in healthy adults. Many other herbs have been shown to increase antibody production, regulate the production of interferon, reduce allergic reactions and increase platelets and red blood cells. Anti-bacterial, anti-protozoal, anti-fungal and anti-tumour herbs have also been documented by Chinese researchers in the past fifteen years. The immune enhancing effects of acupuncture have also been studied. Treatment at specific acupuncture points has been shown to increase interferon production, to boost the ability of leukocytes to kill bacteria, to increase red blood cells in anaemic people, to reduce pain and to bring down fevers. These findings are discussed in detail in Treating AIDS With Chinese Medicine (see Books, below) Anti-viral herbs are mostly defined as heat-clearing and toxin-eliminating in traditional Chinese medicine. Most of the herbs discovered to have virus-clearing properties have a wide-spectrum anti-viral effect. Chinese doctors take the view that anti-viral herbs are effective because they induce immune responses which lead to the elimination of viruses, not because the herbs prevent viral replication. Nevertheless a number of studies have now shown specific anti-HIV effects of a range of anti-viral Chinese herbs in the test tube. Unfortunately, much of this research has not been translated into English, and we must rely on a number of secondary sources written by Chinese physicians for English speaking readers for summaries of this research. The most important herbs include: Viola yeodensitis - inhibits HIV replication in the test tube, but does not kill HIV. Does not inhibit herpes simplex. Does not stimulate interferon production. Also inhibits mycobacterium tuberculosis and many forms of bacteria, and is commonly used to treat viral infections. Andrographis paniculata - inhibits HIV replication and is used to treat tuberculosis Lonicera japonica - inhibits HIV, shigella, salmonella, tuberculosis and many forms of bacteria. Commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis, diarrhoea and lung infections Prunella vulgaris - inhibits HIV, a wide range of bacteria and tuberculosis Senecio scandens - inhibits HIV and protozoa; commonly used as treatment for protozoal and bacterial diarrhoea Epimedium grandiflorum - inhibits HIV and a Hypericum perforatum - inhibits HIV; synthesised as hypericin. Used to treat Hepatitis B in China. The immune-enhancing properties of numerous herbs have been documented by Chinese researchers. The most extensively studied is astragalus (huangqi). It promotes phagocytosis and interferon production in mice, and has also been shown to stimulate antibody production in healthy humans. Astragalus has formed the basis of most Chinese immune enhancing formulas prescribed to people with HIV/AIDS. AIDS and Chinese Medicine and Treating AIDS With Chinese Medicine both summarise research on more than thirty herbs which have demonstrable immune enhancing effects, ranging from increasing the number of white blood cells to increasing antibody production and suppression of A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 221 [Page 222](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/228?q1=directories) allergic reactions. A number of herbs also stimulate the production of red blood cells. Chinese medicine relies upon anti-protozoal herbs to treat malaria, and it has been suggested that some of these herbs might be active against a wide spectrum of protozoa, and therefore of use in treating protozoal infections in people with AIDS. As with anti-viral herbs, Chinese medicine takes the view that the job of herbal treatment is to enhance the body's ability to expel protozoa and parasites, so herbs which are used to treat such infections in China may have no discernable anti-protozoal effect when studied in the test tube. As yet no laboratory or clinical studies have reported results with either Pneumocystis carinii or Cryptosporidium. The basis of most anti-fungal treatments in Chinese medicine is coptis chinensis, which has been extensively studied for its anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties in China. Research into TCM treatment for AIDS A number of reports have now assessed the benefits of herbal treatment and acupuncture, but so far there have been no controlled trials of TCM treatment compared either with no treatment or with orthodox treatment. Doctors at Lincoln Hospital Acupuncture clinic reported on 27 patients who received 7 acupuncture treatments or more. Twenty of these patients reported improvement in symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats, and diarrhoea after 1-3 weeks of treatment (Smith). The patients were treated during 1982 and 1983; five were still alive and in good health five years later, four were dead, and the remainder were lost to follow-up. The clinic also reported two cases in which KS tumours cleared completely in individuals receiving acupuncture treatment alone, but no long-term follow-up details are available. Chinese medical researchers working in collaboration with doctors in Tanzania reported improvements in a wide range of symptoms of patients diagnosed with AIDS treated with Chinese herbs. These include relief or disappearance of fever in 22 of 30 cases; relief or disappearance of fatigue in 21 of 29 cases; disappearance or relief of night sweats in 22 of 23 cases; disappearance of diarrhoea in 9 of 18 cases (Su). The report does not provide information on the subsequent health of the people treated; we do not know for instance how many people suffered subsequent opportunistic infections or how many died despite treatment, and how these results compare with standard treatment in that hospital. All the symptoms reported in these studies are subjective, that is to say, they aren't diagnosed by standard tests. What people define as an improvement in symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats and diarrhoea will vary from one person to another. Although a wealth of anecdotal reports exist concerning the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine in relieving symptoms, increasing energy levels and improving a sense of well-being, we still await results from studies which are able to demonstrate that Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture treatment reduce the incidence of opportunistic infections, clears them up and prolongs life. Given the growing number of HIV-positive people who are turning to traditional Chinese medicine as a treatment option, it is vital that research in this area begins to take place which can demonstrate whether or not TCM can provide the dramatic benefits in AIDS which users hope for. The first steps towards such research have been taken by a team of doctors from San Francisco General Hospital and traditional Chinese medical practitioners in the city, who are conducting a randomised, double-blind trial of a Chinese herbal formula against a placebo. The formula is already prescribed by many TCM practitioners to HIV-positive people. Preliminary results presented at the 1993 Ninth International AIDS Conference suggested that those receiving the Chinese herbal preparation were reporting less fatigue and nausea and fewer night sweats. However, a comparison of harder endpoints such as opportunistic infections and CD4 counts was still awaited as this directory went to press. Side-effects There has been considerable publicity attached to recent reports of poisoning by Chinese herbal medicines. It is therefore essential that anyone choosing Chinese herbal medicine as a therapy knows how to choose an experienced practitioner, what situations increase the risk of dangerous reactions to herbal treatment, and the thinking that underlies Chinese herbal prescriptions. No form of medicine can guarantee freedom from adverse reactions. Although Western medicines are tested on large groups of people to check that they are safe and effective, individuals who are subsequently prescribed these 'safe' medications may suffer serious side-effects either because of individual characteristics which could not be controlled for in a large-scale clinical trial, or because the trials which led to the approval of the drug were not conducted carefully enough in the first place or were not large enough to pick up rare but severe adverse reactions. This is where Chinese herbal medicine claims an advantage. Experienced practitioners say that it is possible to devise a combination of herbs to suit the constitution and medical history of the individual. Since the side-effects of all the herbs used in Chinese medicine have been observed over many centuries, it is possible to prescribe a combination of herbs which includes some that alleviate the side-effects of the more toxic ones. A Chinese herbal formula consists of the Emperor, the strongest herb for the principal function of the formula (e.g. clearing Heat); the Minister, a herb which strongly assists the Emperor and may also have an additional function; the Assistants, herbs which either act synergistically to boost the effects of the key herbs, or which act to modify the side-effects or 'over-effects' of the key herbs; and the Messengers, which direct the other herbs to the proper area. Practitioners need to spend quite a lot of time assessing a patient's symptoms before they make a prescription. You should be wary if a practitioner makes a prescription after a five minute consultation, especially if you are told the herbs are strong. Anyone with liver problems should have liver function tests before taking some herbs, and a good practitioner will want to know whether you have had such tests recently. Concern is often expressed by those sceptical of Chinese medicine that batches of herbs may be poisonous or that the potency of the herbs will vary from one batch to 222 A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES [Page 223](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/229?q1=directories) another. Chinese herbal practitioners say that the gathering of herbs is conducted according to strict rules which have developed over hundreds of years to ensure that each year's harvest will be similar to that of previous years, and therefore contain active ingredients of the same strength. Incidents of poisoning attributed to Chinese herbs have occurred as a consequence of prescription by incompetent practitioners or because they are contaminated with drugs such as steroids. Taking Chinese herbal medicines Many medicines are still prepared as teas from dried herbs which are boiled for anything from ten to thirty minutes. Some people find this process tedious and time-consuming. Some commonly used formulae are sold as tea bags which are prepared in much the same way. A common complaint is that herbs taken in this way taste very unpleasant, so much so that some people are unable to continue with the treatment, and there is an increasing trend towards supplying formulas in tablet form. Many of the formulas commonly used by practitioners in the USA to treat AIDS are prescribed as tablets. The drawback of using tablets is the difficulty of adjusting the formula to take into account later changes in symptoms, and this is why practitioners say that studies of such formulae in people with AIDS tend to show inconclusive results. Powdered forms of herbs can be tailor-made into capsules for each prescription, which avoids the unpleasant taste of herbal teas and the chance that the tablet formula will not contain all the suitable ingredients. In chronic conditions and acute problems powdered herbs or tablet forms of herbs are said to be just as effective as boiled herbs, but people suffering from some infections may be prescribed herbs which must be boiled. The form of the prescription will also depend on the patient; some people are more able to tolerate the unusual taste of some herbs than other people. All practitioners we spoke with stressed the importance of avoiding patent medicines commonly sold in Chinese pharmacies; these remedies often contain Western drugs and are responsible for the most of the poisonings attributed to Chinese herbs. Acupuncture Besides herbs, TCM practice also involves acupuncture, dietary advice, massage and QiGong, a form of physical/meditative activity which aims to move qi around the body. Acupuncture treatment involves the stimulation of particular points on the body in order to improve the flow of qi. Sometimes this is done with needles, but in very debilitated people it may be done with finger pressure, massage or moxibustion, the burning of herbs above the skin. Acupuncture treatment will last anything from fifteen minutes to an hour. The patient will have a number of very fine needles inserted into points on the body. This process is usually painless apart from a mild tingling sensation, although some people complain that acupuncture points become slightly painful after a while, especially those in the hands. Acupuncture is reported by many people to be especially helpful in managing fatigue and stress; many people find acupuncture so relaxing they fall asleep on the acupuncturist's table. It's important to be aware that you may well feel very sleepy within a few hours of treatment, depending on the treatment you received. It's best not to plan a long car journey or an active day after receiving acupuncture without consulting the practitioner on the likely effects of the treatment you are receiving. Acupuncture has been reported by many to be helpful in the management of pain and there has been considerable research to investigate why this might be. Researchers have discovered that acupuncture treatment can increase the flow of endorphins, chemicals which can relieve pain. Acupuncture is very widely used for pain relief in China, and even for anaesthesia before operations. Points may also be stimulated manually by a number of massage techniques; shiatsu is the Japanese equivalent (see Shiatsu for further information). The purpose of massage is also to stimulate the flow of qi. Traditional Chinese dietary advice is based on the belief that foods have energetic properties and that a balanced diet is one which balances these energies and also balances out an excess of an energetic force in the body. Thus Cold foods are often indicated when the patient's condition is Heat-induced. Many of these dietary recommendations differ little from those practiced by Western doctors for hundreds of years. Chicken broth, for instance, is considered to be Warm, and is indicated to assist recuperation from illnesses of a Cold nature, such as flu and colds. Treating AIDS with Chinese Medicine contains a very good section on Chinese dietary advice. The duration of the treatment Practitioners of Chinese traditional medicine aim to prescribe to patients for the shortest time possible. However, it is not a quick cure, and a practitioner may use a succession of remedies to deal with different problems as they arise, especially in an immunocompromised individual. With HIV, the treatment is expected to be long-term, because the patient is being treated for prevention, as well as alleviation, of conditions, and continual assessment is essential. Practitioners say that they felt the attitude of the patient is crucial to the success of the treatment, as was a good support system. TCM practitioners who work in hospices say that helping patients to approach death is one of the main functions of their treatment in such circumstances. Treatment can be aimed at the emotions, helping to deal with anger or fear, for instance. Combining TCM with conventional medicine In TCM care must always be taken to avoid unhelpful reactions between herbs or excessive doses of some herbs. Mixing Chinese and Western medical treatment can bring problems such as the exaggeration of drug effects unless the practitioner is fully aware of any other medication you are receiving. TCM and conventional medicine may be combined in several ways: A-Z OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 223 [Page 224](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/230?q1=directories) * TCM treatment to alleviate the side-effects of conventional medications * TCM treatment to rebuild the constitution after conventional medication has eliminated the microorganism causing the problem * TCM diagnostic techniques may predict the forms of opportunistic infection to which the patient will be most vulnerable, and treatment will then work to alleviate problems in these areas * TCM as the main form of treatment, with conventional drug treatment reserved for circumstances in which TCM offers little in the way of effective remedies * TCM may also be of benefit in treating symptoms for which orthodox medicine cannot identify a cause and therefore offer treatment, such as night sweats. However, it should not be used as a substitute for ongoing investigation of the cause of these symptoms. TCM practitioners are conservative in the claims they make about the benefits of TCM in AIDS, but most report considerable success in dealing with symptoms such as night sweats and unexplained fevers, and in rebuilding strength after opportunistic infections. TCM practitioners consider KS to be the most difficult of all opportunistic infections or tumours to treat, and none of the sources we consulted report any success in treating the disorder. Combining TCM with other complementary therapies TCM combines well with reflexology, but Chinese herbs should not be mixed with Western herbs (although acupuncture may combine with Western herbs). Practitioners should always be told what therapies patients are using. Finding an experienced practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine As with any complementary therapy, it is essential that you go to someone who is properly trained and registered with a professional association. Acupuncturists have not by and large received training in Chinese herbal medicine; conversely, many members of the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine have studied not only Chinese herbal medicine but acupuncture too. Anyone else who is practising acupuncture and herbal medicine needs to be assessed individually on the basis of their training and experience. You should be suspicious if the practitioner seems uncomfortable about answering questions. The patient should remember that the practitioner is the employee. It is important to know about hygiene: are disposable needles used, or does the practitioner have sterilisation procedures which involve autoclaving acupuncture needles (steam cleaning at a very high temperature)? What experience does the practitioner have with HIV? Experience with cancer may be helpful since it is also a long-term chronic illness. It is important to be aware that different practitioners may have different models of AIDS, and this will lead them to make different decisions about treatment. These issues are discussed in detail inthe book Treating AIDS With Chinese Medicine (see below).

In HIV-positive people for instance, visualisation therapy may take the form of conjuring mental images of HIV-infected cells being eliminated from the body, or imagining the whole body as healthy and active once more. Visualisation has been used by many people with cancer, and a considerable amount of research now exists to show that whilst people are doing visualisation exercises, their bodies show a physical response. Although some of these physical responses may simply be a consequence of relaxation and concentration, others are less easily explained. A number of experiments, some more well-controlled than others, have shown changes in immune system function following visualisation exercises involving the visualisation of specific immune system cells. These experiments included the use of guided imagery as part of a programme of relaxation and hypnosis in a group of HIV-positive men with symptoms. When compared to a control group, the treatment group demonstrated a significant decrease in HIV-related symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache, nausea and insomnia, and felt more energetic and able to cope (Aeurbach). Visualisation exercises are often sold as expensive packages of tapes and training courses, but if you want to test the usefulness of such exercises for yourself, you may find that making up your own exercises or working with a group of like-minded people will prove just as effective.

It can occur at any stage of HIV infection; this may seem paradoxical in a disease where the immune system is damaged, but allergy probably occurs because the normal controls on the immune system are not working correctly. Asthma is an example of a disorder which may have an allergic component; it is thought that environmental substances may trigger off difficulty in breathing. People with HIV seem to be more prone to drug allergy than uninfected people. Allergy to co-trimoxazole is often seen during treatment for PCP. This can result in rashes and high fevers. Symptoms Among the common allergic effects are rash, respiratory discomfort such as sneezing, itching eyes and nose and other hay-fever symptoms, swelling in joints, and muscle contractions. For example, asthma causes the muscles in the throat or lungs to contract, restricting the airflow. Diagnosis It is important to identify what is causing the allergy. Sometimes the individual knows from personal experience of when allergic attacks occur. In other cases allergy can be 226 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS identified by skin tests in which small amounts of various substances which may be the cause of the allergy are applied to scratches. Treatment and prophylaxis The best way of treating allergy is to avoid exposure to the substance in question; for example, drug allergy is best treated by using an alternative drug if one is available. In some cases an individual can be desensitised by starting on very low doses of the drug, then gradually increasing them until the normal doses are reached. Severe allergic symptoms may need to be treated specifically; for example, asthma attacks can be treated with drugs such as salbutamol which helps to clear the airways. Anti-histamines and steroids are usually effective in curbing allergy. Steroids tend not to be used much in HIV infection because they suppress the immune system, possibly increasing the risk of infections. * Anogenital cancer Anogenital cancer is cancer of the genitals, anus and/or surrounding area in men or women. People with HIV are at an increased risk of such cancers, many of which may be associated with infection with human papilloma virus (HPV). [Page 227](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/233?q1=directories) * Aspergillosis Aspergillosis is infection with a fungus called Aspergillus. This is found throughout the world in a variety of species, usually in decaying vegetation and soil. It is quite rare for people to experience problems from exposure to Aspergillus, including in people with HIV, although there are suggestions that it is becoming more common in London. People who have a low platelet count (neutropenia), who have been taking steroids for a long time or who smoke marijuana may be at increased risk. People who have had PCP are also at increased risk, especially if the PCP resulted in cyst-like cavities inthe lungs. Aspergillosis also seems to be more common in people with CMV disease. Symptoms Aspergillosis can cause lung problems in people with HIV, and can sometimes also affect other parts of the body including the sinuses, bones, heart and skin. Its symptoms can include cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing, fever and night sweats. Diagnosis Aspergillosis can be diagnosed by microscopic examination of samples of fluid drawn from the lung or sinus (by techniques called aspiration or broncho-alveolar lavage), or by growing the organisms from these samples or from spit. Treatment and prophylaxis Antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole have been reported to be effective treatments. There is no standard prophylaxis against aspergillosis; however, antifungal drugs taken for other fungal conditions may also offer a degree of protection against Aspergillus. Research Klapholz and Pursell have published reviews of aspergillosis in AIDS. Keating reported that aspergillosis has become more common among people with HIV at one London centre. They reported on 12 cases, 1 1 of which occurred during 1993. In every case specific risk factors were present, such as the presence of lymphoma or neutropenia induced by chemotherapy for KS or broad-spectrum antibiotics. 11 of the 12 had a CD4 count below 50. Denning treated 7 patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with either itraconazole or amphotericin B (AmB) for 7 days or more; 6/7 showed some response. 2/3 of the responders receiving AmB relapsed; 1/4 who responded to itraconazole later relapsed. Previous reports indicate that ketoconazole has little activity against aspergillosis. Patterson evaluated the combination of fluconazole and amphotericin B for the treatment or prophylaxis of aspergillosis in rabbits. In the treatment group, mortality occurred in 10/10 controls, 1/7 AmB alone, 2/9 fluconazole alone and 0/6 on the combination. Treated rabbits had reduced colony counts compared to controls. In the prophylaxis arm, antigen levels were significantly reduced in all groups and colony counts were reduced 10-100 fold compared to controls. No antagonism between fluconazole and amphotericin B was noted. Kauffman treated 80 patients with itraconazole; 65% patients responded to treatment after three months. Nelson reported a case in which a man with a history of MAI and CMV retinitis was successfully treated for aspergillosis with itraconazole, but later developed aspergillosis in the kidney despite taking itraconazole maintenance therapy. The relapse was successfully treated with UK 109,496. References Denning D et al. Pulmonary aspergillosis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. NEJM 324(10):654-62, 1991. Kauffman CA et al.

It is similar to Candida. Tinea can spread to the hands, nails, lower abdomen and buttocks, groin, thighs or feet, and tends to be called different names in different places. On the feet, tinea is called athlete's foot. In the groin, it is called athlete's crotch or jock itch. Symptoms When the skin is kept moist and warm (athlete's foot) or if the immune system is damaged, the fungus can grow out of control causing flaky red skin or moist white patches on the feet, face or groin, or spots like acne, or severe dandruff. Treatment and prophylaxis It will help to keep the skin dry, and avoid possible irritants such as scented soaps, deodorants or after shave or perfume. Your doctor can prescribe a course of antifungal cream such as miconazole or occasionally antifungal pills: the rash tends to get better very quickly. Over the counter preparations are not usually strong enough to eradicate the problems. Tinea can be persistent, especially on the toe-nails, so ongoing use of antifungal cream or tablets may be needed. * B19 parvovirus Parvoviruses are a small family of viruses which cause winter vomiting disease - outbreaks of nausea, vomiting, giddiness and diarrhoea which affect whole families or communities like schools during the winter. B19 parvovirus is a particular virus which can cause severe chronic anaemia (shortage of red blood cells) in people with damaged immune systems. It has also been linked to shortage of all blood cells (pancytopenia) in HIV-positive children. Symptoms and diagnosis Anaemia usually causes a feeling of weakness and giddiness, often accompanied by rapid breathing, fast pulse and low blood pressure.

There are also tests that can detect the virus itself in samples of bone marrow cells. However, B19 parvovirus-related anaemia may go undiagnosed because the condition causes no other symptoms, and an infectioius cause may not be suspected. Treatment Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been reported to be effective at parvovirus-associated anaemia. Research Frickhofen reported reversing B19 parvovirus-associated anaemia seven HIV-positive adults. Based on findings by Nigro, B19 infection can be regarded as a cause of pancytopenia in children with HIV infection. References Frickhofen et al.

SBacterial infections Bacteria are tiny microorganisms which can infect anyone. They can cause infection even when a person's immune system is unaffected by HIV. In an uninfected person, various parts of the immune system play different roles in protecting against bacteria. People with HIV may have abnormalities in their immune system which make them more vulnerable to bacterial infections: immunoglobulins (antibodies) are not secreted properly; monocytes don't work properly; the bone marrow may be damaged by drugs such as AZT, ganciclovir or anti-cancer chemotherapy; and HIV itself may prevent the release of neutrophils. Bacteria can cause a range of different problems in different parts of the body. Co-trimoxazole as PCP prophylaxis offers a good level of protection against bacterial infections. Bacterial infections of the blood (bacteraemia) Bacteraemia means bacterial infection of the blood. This is common in people with HIV because bacterial infections in organs such as the lungs or gut can spread into the bloodstream. Moreover, injecting drug users may inadvertently inject bacteria into their blood through unsterile injecting equipment, and mMedical procedures such as insertion of Hickman lines can either directly lead to infection or indirectly by making the neutrophil count fall. The commonest causes of bacteraemia are Staphylococcus aureus and other so-called 'gram negative' bacteria. Different bacteria are treated with different antibiotics. Catheter-associated infections may initially be treated with antibiotics leaving the catheter in place, but if the individual is acutely ill or has persistent fever or bacteraemia it is usually necessary to remove the catheter. As many as 50% of HIV-positive people with bacteraemia may have no symptoms. However, untreated bacterial infections can become very serious. Serious blood infection 228 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS is known as septicaemia, and requires urgent treatment. Consequently, it is necessary to make a 'best guess' of the right antibiotics to give before laboratory results confirm this diagnosis. Bacterial infections of the gut These can cause diarrhoea or stomach pains. Bacteria like Shigella and Campylobacter jejuni stay in the gut, causing symptoms there. The symptoms of Shigella infection include fever, abdominal pain and tenderness and bloody diarrhoea; these symptoms usually get gradually worse over a period of weeks. Campylobacter is more common, causing fever, diarrhoea and weight loss. Salmonella organisms can invade the rest of the body from the gut and cause septicaemia. When these infections are only causing diarrhoea, it may be that anti-diarrhoea drugs and precautions against spreading the infections are all that is needed. If the infections have spread into the blood, then antibiotics are definitely needed. Bacterial infections of the lungs Bacteria can infect the lungs in people with HIV. Such infection is probably commoner in smokers. It can cause either a mild cough or a severe pneumonia. This pneumonia can be extremely difficult to distinguish from PCP, and may only be possible with a bronchoscopy. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza are common bacterial causes of lung infection, as well as other bacteria in the streptococci family. The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported to be the casue of between 0 and 24% of cases of bacterial pneumonia in people with HIV. Lung infections usually improve with high dose broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxycillin or acephalosporin. These are used in the first instance rather than co-trimoxazole, to ensure that any improvement can be attributed to the treatment of bacterial infection rather than the suppression of undiagnosed PCP. Occasionally, if infections recur and tests show levels of immunoglobulin to be low, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be given. Doctors may recommend a vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae, as well as the standard flu vaccine. This vaccine can sometimes fail to provide protection in people with HIV because they do not produce antibodies properly, but taking AZT may improve response to the vaccine. Bacterial infections of the skin Bacterial skin problems are most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Folliculitis - or infection of the follicles - causes small lumps or pustules on the face, trunk or groin. S. aureus can also cause bullous impetigo - fluid filled blisters, often in the groin or armpit. These conditions normally respond to treatment with antistaphylococcus antibiotics such as penicillin or cephalosporin. Pyomyositis is a condition which occasionally affects people with advanced HIV disease; it causes inflammation and pus-filled abscesses in the muscles. This can result in fever and painful swelling of (usually) the soft tissue in the legs, and may need surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic treatment. Bacillary angiomatosis is a relatively recently described condition. On the skin it causes painless lesions that resemble KS. It can also affect the internal organs, causing fever, abdominal pain and liver failure. The cause is not [Page 229](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/235?q1=directories) known for sure, but bacteria belonging to the Rochmalimea family have been implicated. The mode of infection is also not clear, but there is some evidence to suggest that cats may carry them. The skin lesions usually clear up promptly after treatment with the antibiotic erythromycin, and may also improve internally. An alternative treatment is azithromycin. Sinusitis Infection and/or inflammation of the sinuses is a relatively common problem among people with HIV. Symptoms can range from a mild 'head cold' (known technically as coryza) to fever, headache and discharges from the nose. The most common bacterial infections which cause sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza and Pseudomonas species. Sinusitis is commonly treated with antibiotics and/or decongestants. Most people seem to have at least a partial improvement with antibiotics, although it can be difficult to clear up the problem entirely. In severe cases surgery to clear the sinuses may be offered. Urinary tract infections There is some evidence that men with HIV are more prone to bacterial infections of the urinary tract (bacteriuria), and that the occurrence of these infections may be related to the CD4 cell count. One study has found that nearly a third of men with CD4 counts less than 200 developed bacteriuria, compared with 11% of men with counts between 200-500, and none in men with CD4 counts greater than 500. Bacteriuria can cause back pain and fever, but it may not cause any symptoms at all and so go undiagnosed; however, it does respond to treatment with antibiotics. Bacterial infections in children Children with HIV are particularly prone to bacterial infections. In fact, recurrent or multiple bacterial infections in HIV-positive children under 13 are diagnostic of AIDS, which is not the case in adults. This susceptibility to bacterial infections is probably due to children's inability to make immunoglobulin. This can be given intravenously (IVIG) and has been found to reduce the occurrence of bacterial infections in children with CD4 counts below 200. Research Selwyn reported that in HIV+ injection drug users, pyogenic bacterial infections are both a substantial cause of pre-AIDS morbidity and mortality and a significant predictor of progression to AIDS. In this prospective study of a cohort of patients from a methadone clinic, 13/318 HIV+ patients without a diagnosis of AIDS died of bacterial infections, while 1/411 HIV-negative patients died of bacterial infections. Steinhoff compared H. influenzae type b polysaccharide (PRP) vaccine to the polysaccharide-mutant diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (PRP-CRM). In asymptomatic and early symptomatic HIV-positive men (and in HIV-negative men), the PRP-CRM vaccine caused a three-fold greater antibody response than the PRP vaccine. However, in men with AIDS, the PRP vaccine caused a greater response. Small examined the incidence of sinusitis among people with HIV. 22 (59%) of a sample of 37 HIV-positive people had sinusitis. 14 of the 22 had AIDS, and there was a significant association between severity of sinusitis and stage of disease. IgE levels increased with disease progression and were strongly correlated with disease severity. Schuster reported on 16 people with Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. Most had AIDS with a mean CD4 count of 27. Traditional risk factors were often missing. Cavitary infiltrates were present on admission chest radiograph in 50% of cases. In-hospital mortality was 19%, and an additional 25% developed chronic or recurrent disease. Glaser reported that AZT improves response to pneumococcal vaccine among people with AIDS or ARC. Koehler reported that rochalimea may infect healthy cats and their fleas belonging to HIV-positive people with bacillary angiomatosis, and a possible route of transmission may be contact with the blood, daliva and fleas of domestic cats. Tappero reported on the epidemiology of bacillary angiomatosis among 48 people, 42 of whom were HIV-positive. Owning a cat, cat scratch or cat bite were associated with the disease in univariate analysis. In bivariate, only traumatic contact with a cat (scratch or bite) remained associated with disease. No other environmental exposure was associated with disease. Guerra reported a case study in which bacillary angiomatosis was successfully treated with azithromycin. In a post-hoc analysis of a randomized study and aerosolized pentamidine for secondary PCP prophylaxis (ACTG 021), fewer serious bacterial infections occurred in the TMP/SMX group. Hardy reported that 19 bacterial infections occurred in 154 TMP/SMX recipients, while 38 infections occurred in 156 aerosolized pentamidine recipients. The time to a bacterial infection was significantly longer in the TMP/SMX group. Hoepelman reported that bacteriuria in HIV-positive men in related to CD4 count. Nearly a third of men with CD4 counts less than 200 developed bacteriuria, compared with 1 1% of men with counts between 200-500, and none in men with CD4 counts greater than 500. Thompson reported that many people with HIV-related sinusitis are infected with common bacteria (in particular Staphylococcus epidermis). References Chaisson RE.

Although it is an important fungal disease in parts of the midwestern and southern central USA, it is very rare in people with HIV and other immunocompromised people. It can be treated effectively with the antifungal drugs amphotericin B, itraconazole and ketoconazole. Research Pappas reviewed reports of blastomycosis in people with HIV in a retrospective survey, identifying only 15 cases. 12/15 had a previous or concomitant AIDS-defining illness; only one had a CD4 count above 200. Two patterns of disease emerged: localised pulmonary involvement (n=7) and disseminated or extrapulmonary blastomycosis (n=8). CNS involvement was common (40%). Among the 9 patients who survived longer than one month, all received amphotericin B as initial therapy and most received subsequent therapy with ketoconazole. References Pappas et al. Blastomycosis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Ann Int Med 17 6(10):847-853, 1992. * Candidiasis Candidiasis is a fungal condition, also known as thrush. The most common cause is a very common yeast or fungus called Candida albicans, although candidiasis can also be caused by related fungi such as Candida krusei and Torulopsis glabrata. These fungi are very common, but do not normally cause health problems because a fully-functioning immune system can keep them suppressed. In people whose immune systems are damaged, however, Candida can overgrow and cause symptoms. They can also flourish if the immune system is suppressed for other reasosn, such as stress, other viral infections or conditions such as diabetes, or if other normal microorganisms that live in the body are killed by a course of antibiotics. Symptoms Candidiasis can range in severity. It may be very mild and can go unnoticed. However, by looking in the mouth it may be possible to see symptoms such as redness or white patches. There may be pain in the mouth, especially on swallowing solid foods, or in the vagina in women or under the foreskin in men. You may see white blobs (which can be moved, unlike hairy oral leucoplakia) or red spots. Genital candidiasis occurs commonly in people with normal immune systems. Oral candidiasis is the commonest manifestation of this fungus in HIV infection. It may indicate only very slight damage of the immune system, not necessarily by HIV itself. Oesophageal candidiasis is candida in the gullet (oesophagus), where it causes chest pain and difficulty in swallowing. Although the mouth and the gullet adjoin one another, oesophageal candidiasis does imply slightly more damage and it is formally diagnostic of AIDS. Cerebral candidiasis (Candida in the brain) and pulmonary candidiasis (Candida in the lungs) can sometimes occur in people with severe immune damage. These conditions are not common, but could mimic the symptoms of toxoplasmosis brain abscesses or PCP, respectively. Very rarely, Candida can spread to other organs such as the eye, liver and kidney. Diagnosis Candida in the mouth can be presumptively diagnosed simply by examining it, but definitive diagnosis and diagnosis of Candida in other parts of the part requires a sample to be taken by biopsy or smear and examined under the microscope. Tests for Candida itself or antibodies to it in the blood are not very reliable. Treatment In milder candidiasis, some complementary therapists advise completely avoiding refined sugars, which thrush feeds off. This would mean avoiding most sweet things, including white flour and starchy foods. However, if you take this option you should consult with your doctor to make sure you are getting enough calories in your diet. Live yoghurt can help: it has to be live and unpasteurised because you want the Lactobacillus bacteria in the yoghurt to compete with the thrush. But there is a very small risk that live yoghurt may contain TB, brucellosis, listeria or salmonella, so try to make sure that it's from a 'certified herd' which is carefully screened against these germs. The yoghurt is applied directly to the vagina, or is eaten, or both. There are also various antifungal drugs that are effective. Nystatin antifungal syrup or mouthwash (aniseed flavoured), or amphotericin lozenges may be helpful. They have few side-effects. In more severe candidiasis, fluconazole tablets or itraconazole tablets (or occasionally available as a mouthwash) may be prescribed. The related anti-fungal ketoconazole may also be given as tablets or applied as a cream. This has more side-effects than itraconazole or fluconazole, such as rashes, nausea and sometimes jaundice. It also seems to be somewhat less effective. Antacids, anti-convulsants and the TB drug rifampin appear to reduce the body's absorption of itraconazole and ketoconazole, but affect fluconazole to a lesser extent. Some Candida strains develop resistance to fluconazole, especially after long-term treatment. It is in these cases that alternatives to fluconazole are most likely to be used. Prophylaxis There is no agreed standard practice for providing primary prophylaxis to try to prevent the occurrence of a first episode of Candida. Some doctors offer their patients low dose fluconazole, but long-term use may be inadvisable because candida strains which are resistant to fluconazole frequently develop. After treating an episode of candidiasis, some doctors advocate staying on a low dose of ketoconazole, itraconazole or fluconazole to prevent Candida returning (i.e. as secondary prophylaxis). This may also help prevent cryptococcosis in the case of high dose fluconazole. 230 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS [Page 231](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/237?q1=directories) There is also some preliminary evidence that for women with recurrent vaginal candidiasis, consuming live yoghurt every day can reduce the amount of Candida in the vagina. Research on treatment Pons conducted a 14 day comparative study of fluconazole (100 mg by mouth every day) versus clotrimazole (10 mg by mouth 5 times a day) in 258 people with oral thrush, reporting comparable clinical response in both groups. However, fluconazole was judged more effective in eliminating the fungal pathogen (with more rapid remission of symptoms) and maintaining a disease-free state. Preliminary results of a study conducted by Soubry comparing itraconazole (200 mg/day by mouth for 7 days) and fluconazole (50 mg/day by mouth for 7 days) in 20 people with oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis suggest that fluconazole and itraconazole are equally effective. De Wit (1993) randomly treated 51 people with oral candidiasis with either single-dose fluconazole (150 mg) or seven days of fluconazole (50 mg/day). Clinical cure was observed at day 7 in 21/24 (85%) people treated with single-dose of fluconazole and 26/27 (96%) treated for 7 days (difference not significant). De Wit (1989) conducted a randomised, double-blind study of fluconazole and ketoconazole. 37 HIV-infected people with oropharyngeal candidiasis were treated with either fluconazole (50 mg by mouth every day) or ketoconazole (200 mg by mouth every day) for 28 days. Clinical remission was achieved at the end of therapy in all fluconazole-treated cases and 75% of ketoconazole-treated cases. de Repentigny compared itraconazole 200 mg daily and ketoconazole 200 mg daily for the treatment of oropharyngeal (n = 76) or endoscopically-proven oesophageal (n = 16) candidiasis. 128 participants were enrolled and treated for 14 and 28 days for oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis, respectively. No significant difference in time to clearing infection was observed between the two treatments. However, time to relapse was greater and cumulative relapse rates were lower in people treated with itraconazole compared to ketoconazole. Smith (1991) enrolled 106 evaluable people with oesophageal candidiasis in a randomised trial comparing itraconazole (200 mg/day) with ketoconazole (200 mg by mouth twice a day) for 28 days. After 1 week, 75% and 82% of the itraconazole and ketoconazole groups respectively had responded clinically. After 4 weeks of treatment response was 93% in each group. 1 participant discontinued itraconazole because of rash; 5 discontinued ketoconazole (2 nausea, 2 hepatotoxicity, 1 rash). Relapse rates were identical with 80% having a further episode of candidosis within 3 months. Laine conducted a randomised, double-blind study of fluconazole (100 mg every day) and ketoconazole (200 mg every day). 169 HIV-positive people with oesophageal candidiasis were treated for up to 8 weeks. Endoscopic cure occurred in 58/64 (91%) participants treated with fluconazole and 34/65 (52%) ketoconazole. Clinical fluconazole-treated participants and 46/71 (65%) in ketoconazole-treated participants. The authors speculate that the superior efficacy of fluconazole may be explained by its more consistent gastric absorption. Urbain treated 34 HIV-positive people who had oesophageal candidiasis with fluconazole (100 mg by mouth every day), all responded; transient elevations in liver enzymes were noted in 3/34. Relapse occurred in 6/33 people after a mean of 45 days; symptoms abated with re-treatment. Cartledge reported that terfinabine proved ineffective against oral candida in a pilot study. Dupont observed clinical resistance to fluconazole despite dosages from 50 to 400 mg/day in 45 people with thrush or oesophageal candidiasis. Paugam reported that treatment failure in patients with fluconazole-treated oral candidiasis correlates with in vitro resistance of C. albicans to fluconazole. Mahmood treated 16 people with fluconazole-resistant oropharyngeal candidiasis with itraconazole solution (200 mg daily for two weeks, then three times per week). Clinical responses were observed in 10/16 (63%), usually within two weeks. Relapse was noted in two patients at 3-6 months of therapy. 4/1 6 had Candida strains that were cross-resistant to itraconazole, which appeared to account for 3 of the 6 failures. Research on prophylaxis and maintenance Grnewald treated 69 HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts below 200 (median 27) who had at least two prior episodes of oral or oesophageal candidiasis with biweekly oral fluconazole 100 mg. With a median follow-up of 9 months (range 2-15 months) 14/69 participants developed candidiasis. 7 developed oral, 5 developed oesophageal and 2 developed both. Fungal cultures were done on 30/69 people. C. albicans was isolated from 7 of the 30 subjects. Just-Nubling conducted a randomized, open-label study of fluconazole as prophylaxis for recurrent oral candidiasis in HIV-positive people with CD4 counts below 100. 58 evaluable participants received fluconazole either 50 or 100 mg daily (observation time 137-215 days). Compared to untreated controls, fluconazole prophylaxis significantly reduced the frequency of candidiasis relapse. The two fluconazole doses were equally effective. Other studies have shown (Esposito; Stevens) that fluconazole (50-100 mg daily) appears to be effective in preventing recurrence of oral candidiasis in the short term (3-6 months). Reynes treated 53 people for oral candidiasis with fluconazole (50 mg a day, for 2-4 weeks). After initial treatment, participants were given oral fluconazole (50 mg a day, in alternating weeks) as maintenance therapy and followed for a mean of six months. During that period, one third had a severe relapse. Smith (1994) randomised 44 people who had had an episode or oral and/or oesophageal candidiasis successfuly treated with itraconazole to receive either maintenance therapy with itraconazole (200 mg/day) or placebo. After 6 months follow-up 68% of the itraconazole recipients remained free of Candida, versus 13% of the placebo group. 2/16 itraconazole recipients discontinued because of possible hepatotoxicity which may not have been drug-related. Parente assigned people with AIDS whose oesophageal candidiasis had resolved following treatment either to receive maintenance therapy with fluconazole (50 mg/day) or ketoconazole (200 mg/day) or placebo. During 12 months follow-up, 84% of the placebo group experienced relapses, compared with a cumulative total of 38% of the treatment arms. No significant differences between fluconazole and ketoconazole were observed. Hilton conducted a crossover trial with women with verified episodes of candida vaginitis who were evaluated for 6 months without yoghurt ingestion and for 6 subsequent months with daily Lactobacillus acidophilus-yoghurt ingestion. 33 women with recurrent candidal vaginitis were recruited, but 12 were eliminated for protocol violations, and of the remaining 21,8 who were assigned to the yoghurt arm initially refused to enter the control phase 6 months later. 13 patients completed the protocol. A threefold decrease in infections was seen when patients consumed yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. The mean number of infections per 6 months was 2.54 in the control arm and 0.38 in the yoghurt arm. Candidal colonisation decreased from a mean of 3.23 per 6 months in the control arm to 0.84 per 6 months in the yoghurt arm. Marriott enrolled 84 people in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of fluconazole as secondary prophylaxis for oral candidiasis. After two to four weeks of therapy with fluconazole, participants were randomized to receive fluconazole (150 mg weekly) or placebo. Of the 73 evaluable participants, the median time to relapse was more than168 days for the fluconazole group and 37 days for the placebo group. Fiore concluded that fluconazole is effective in preventing mucosal candidiasis in HIV-positive women. Fifty women with CD4 counts below 500 were enrolled in a randomized cross-over study to receive either fluconazole 50 mg three times weekly or no treatment with intensive monitoring for candidal infections. Upon intention-to-treat analysis, mucosal candidiasis developed in 48% women who did not receive treatment and in 16% of the women receiving fluconazole. Multiple recurrences of candidiasis occurred in 35% who did not receive treatment and 6% in the fluconazole group. Nittayananta reported that although smoking is a recognised risk factor for oral candidiasis among the general population, in a cohort of 94 HIV-positive individuals smokers were at no greater risk of developing clinical candidiasis than non-smokers. However, Candida species could be isolated in the mouths of a significantly higher proportion of smokers than non-smokers (88.7% versus 65.6%). References Cartledge JD et al.

SCoccidioidomycosis Coccioidomycosis is a disease caused by the fungus Coccidioides immitis, which is found in the southwestern U.S., Mexico, and Central and South America. It is very rare in Britain. In people with damaged immune systems (CD4 counts usually below 100) it can grow in the lungs, and in advanced disease may also involve the kidneys, spleen, lymph nodes, brain (causing meningitis), and thyroid. Symptoms and diagnosis It causes a range of non-specific symptoms, including malaise, weight loss, fatigue and cough. It is diagnosed by examining samples of spit under the microscope, or by growing (culturing) the fungus from a sample of blood, urine, skin, lymph node or lung tissue. Lung tissue is obtained using a special fibre-optic instrument called a bronchoscope. Treatment and prophylaxis Coccidioidomycosis is usually treated with intravenous amphotericin B (total dose 0.5 - 1.5 mg/kg/day). Itraconazole and ketoconazole are effective treatments for 232 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS non-meningeal coccidioidomycosis, and fluconazole has be n shown to be efficacious against coccidioidal me. ngiis. At er an episode is treated, maintenance therapy (se. ondary prophylaxis) may be provided with fluconazole or ketoconazole. Research Galgicni (1993) treated 47 people with coccidioidal meningitis with fluconazole (400 mg/day). Nine of these patients were HIV positive, none of them responded to treatment at this dose. 6/9 received fluconazole 800 mg/day; 4/6 responded. Coccidioidis immitis with fluconazole (200-400 mg by mouth every day) and 38 patients with coccidioidal meningitis with fluconazole (400 mg by mouth every day). 61% of non-meningeal subjects improved clinically by the eighth month of treatment; 1/38 patients with meningeal disease failed to respond and 4 died. No significant toxicities were observed. References Ampel NM et al. Coccidioidomycosis during human immunodeficiency virus infection: results of a prospective study in a coccidiodal endemic area.

SCryptococcus Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast-like fungus which is found worldwide (although it is much more common in Africa than in Europe), often in soil which has been contaminated by bird excrement. It usually gets into the body through the lungs, and is not spread from person-to-person. About 5-10% of people with HIV develop cryptococcosis - illness due to Cryptococcus. People with HIV are usually considered to be at risk if their CD4 count falls below 125. It usually causes meningitis - inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (the meninges) - but can cause problems in other parts of the body, such as the lungs. Laboratory research suggests that infection with Cryptococcus can also increase HIV replication. Symptoms and diagnosis In the lungs Cryptococcus can cause inflammation (pneumonitis) and the build-up of fluid in the space between the lungs and the ribs (pleural effusion). The symptoms of cryptococcal meningitis, which tend to get gradually worse over a period of several weeks, include headache and stiff neck, discomfort in bright light, fever, neurological problems such as a stroke, disorientation leading to coma, non-specific signs and symptoms such as nausea, weight loss and general malaise. A number of other problems might be responsible for such symptoms, however, such as HIV aseptic meningitis, toxoplasmosis in the brain cerebral CMV. [Page 233](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/239?q1=directories) also the early stages of cryptococcal meningitis. Diagnosis of Cryptococcus involves testing a sample of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from the spinal column by a lumbar puncture. The researcher will either test the sample for the presence of Cryptococcus antigen, or try to grow (culture) the organism. These tests can also be used to check whether maintenance therapy is successfully suppressing the organisms. Treatment Severe attacks of cryptococcal meningitis (for example, when the individual is experiencing mental problems and has a high level of Cryptococcus in the CSF) need treatment with amphotericin B (0.6-1.0 mg/kg/day) for 6-8 weeks or longer. Amphotericin is a toxic drug which has to be given by a central venous line, such as a Hickman line or Portacath, or other system into a big vein for up to six weeks, and can cause shivering attacks with fevers, kidney problems and bone-marrow suppression leading to anaemia. Giving an infusion of a pain killer at the same time can reduce some of the symptoms. Sometimes amphotericin is used in combination with the drug flucytosine (75-150 mg/kg/day in four divided doses), allowing lower doses of amphotericin to be given. Flucytosine can suppress the bone marrow, and careful monitoring of blood levels of the drug is important. In less severe attacks it is possible to use fluconazole (400 mg/day) or itraconazole. These drugs can be taken orally and have far fewer side-effects than amphotericin B and flucytosine. Fluconazole has excellent penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and has been shown to be just as effective as amphotericin B, and itraconazole seems to be about as effective as fluconazole. Fluconazole combined with flucytosine appears to be a more effective treatment than fluconazole alone. There have been reports that Cryptococcus can develop resistance to fluconazole, and that in these cases fluconazole treatment for cryptococcal meningitis is more likely to fail. Researchers are testing the effectiveness of liposomal forms of amphotericin B as treatments for cryptococcosis. Early studies suggest that the treatment is effective and causes far fewer side-effects than the standard form of amphotericin B. Prophylaxis Once an episode of cryptococcal menigitis has been successfully treated (and repeat lumbar punctures and/or blood tests can confirm this) it is still necessary to receive maintenance therapy (secondary prophylaxis). If this is not given there is a good chance the meningitis will flare up again. Maintenance usually consists of fluconazole capsules (200-400 mg/day), which have been shown to be more effective as maintenance therapy than amphotericin B. Itraconazole also appears to be effective. If fluconazole fails to prevent a relapse, the dose may be increased to 600-800 mg/day, or amphotericin B used instead. It may be possible to reduce the risk of cryptococcal meningitis ever happening (primary prophylaxis). Studies on people who were taking fluconazole for long periods, primarily to prevent oral candidiasis, showed a very much reduced risk of developing cryptococcal meningitis. This is not currently a recommended form of prophylaxis, but may become so in the future. Research on treatment Pettoello-Mantovani reported that in vitro, co-infection with Cryptococcus neoformans enhances HIV production. Lecomte studied 39 symptomatic people with AIDS patients to correlate CD4 counts with risk of developing cryptococcosis. 97% of these people had CD4 counts below 100 at time of cryptococcosis diagnosis and 90% tested positive for soluble cryptococcal antigen in serum. Eason reported that 90% of Cryptococcus infections in people with AIDS occur at CD4 counts below 125. Horn demonstrated that the anti-cryptococcal activity of natural killer cells from asymptomatic HIV-positive people is impaired and that the activity can be restored to normal with exogenous interleukin-2 and gamma interferon. Saag reported on 194 people with cryptococcal meningitis (CM) who completed 10 weeks of primary treatment with either oral fluconazole (200 mg every day) or intravenous amphotericin B (at least 0.3 mg/kg/day). Treatment was successful (as measured by a CSF culture negative for CM) in 44/131 (34%) people receiving fluconazole compared with 25/63 (40%) in amphotericin B recipients. Mortality rates were similar for both groups: (18% for fluconazole, 14% for amphotericin B). Within the first two weeks of treatment more deaths occurred in the fluconazole-treated group (19/131, 15%) compared with the amphotericin B group (5/63, 8%). Disease progression occurred in a higher percentage of the participants receiving fluconazole (20% vs 11%) whereas drug toxicity leading to treatment failure occurred in a greater percentage of those receiving amphotericin B (8% versus 2%). Pretreatment factors identified as predictive of treatment failure were a positive India ink stain, visual abnormalities, age less than 35 years and absence of AZT therapy. Pretreatment factors predictive of early death were abnormal mental status (coma, lethargy, confusion), CSF cryptococcal-antigen titre greater than 1:1024 and a positive culture for C. neoformans. Larsen compared the efficacy of fluconazole (400 mg/day for 10 days) with amphotericin B (0.7 mg/kg body for 1 week, then three times weekly for 9 weeks) combined with flucytosine (150 mg/kg/d) in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. in 20 people. 8/14 people assigned to fluconazole failed, compared with none of the 6 receiving amphotericin. Overall, 4 patients assigned to fluconazole therapy died whereas no-one assigned to amphotericin B died. de Gans compared amphotericin B (0.3 mg/kg intravenously daily) plus oral flucytosine (150 mg/kg daily) to oral itraconazole (200 mg twice daily) for 6 weeks as initial therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in 28 people with AIDS. All 10 who completed treatment with amphotericin B plus flucytosine had a complete response, compared with 5/12 who completed treatment with itraconazole. 7/14 participants assigned to itraconazole had a partial response. All participants received maintenance therapy with itraconazole (200 mg daily). Recrudescence (n=6) or relapse (n= 1) occurred in 7/12 people initially assigned to itraconazole, whereas 2 relapses occurred among 9 participants initially treated with amphotericin B plus flucytosine. Recurrence of clinical symptoms was significantly related to a positive CSF culture at 6 weeks. Milefchik treated 36 people with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis with fluconazole (800 mg, 1200 mg or 1600 mg) alone for up to 26 weeks or combined with flucytosine (150 mg/kg) daily for four weeks. Of those given fluconazole alone, 33%, 38% and 25% respectively survived and became CSF culture negative. 5/7 given fluconazole (800 mg) plus flucytosine and 4/5 fiven fluconazole (1200 mg) plus flucytosine survived and became culture negative. Moskovitz treated 66 evaluable people who had a first episode of confirmed cryptococcal meningitis with either itraconazole (200 mg twice daily) or fluconazole (400 mg/day). Loading doses of 200 mg three times daily were given for the first 3 days. After 20 weeks, 11/29 itraconazole recipients had negative CSF cultures, versus 15/37 in the fluconazole group. There were 3 deaths on itraconazole and 10 on fluconazole. 5 itraconazole and 10 fluconazole recipients stopped treatment due to adverse events. While there was no statistically significant difference in CSF sterilisation rates, which were comparable to previous studies of fluconaole monotherapy, the sample was too small to conclude equivalence. Berry treated 7 people with AIDS with cryptococcal meningitis who had failed prior antifungal therapy with fluconazole (800 mg by mouth every day) as salvage therapy. 4/7 patients responded to treatment (mean duration of treatment was 4.5 months). No major drug toxicity was observed. Milefchik randomised 36 people with cryptococcal meningitis to receive fluconazole (800, 1200 or 1600 mg/day) alone or in combination with flucytosine (150 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks). Of the participants receiving only fluconazole, 7/24 (29%) survived and became CSF culture negative, compared with 9/12 (75%) receiving the combination. Jones treated 15 people with cryptococcal meningitis with fluconazole (400 mg/day) plus flucytosine (150 mg/kg/day) for 10 weeks. 11/15 patients converted from CSF culture positive to negative (mean conversion time was 21.4 days). 2/15 patients died, 1 due to cryptococcosis. Side-effects associated with flucytosine were gastro-intestinal complaints in 6 patients A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 233 [Page 234](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/240?q1=directories) and neutropenia in 2. Median duration of flucytosine treatment was 6.9 weeks. Holtom enrolled 15 people in a study comparing standard amphotericin B therapy (0.3 mg/kg every day) plus flucytosine (150 mg/kg every day) with intrathecal amphotericin B (up to 0.6 mg/kg for 6 days). Investigators concluded that intrathecal amphotericin B offered no survival benefits, and is associated with frequent and severe transient spinal-cord injury. Coker treated 23 people with cryptococcosis with liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) (1.0 mg/kg on day 1, 2.0 mg/kg on day 2 and 3.0 mg/kg/day thereafter for at least 42 days) in a Phase II multicentre trial. 18/23 responded clinically; sterilisation of CSF was achieved in 12/18 with cryptococcal meningitis. Drug toxicity was well-tolerated with little renal, hepatic or haematological toxicity. Lazar treated 9 people with cryptococcosis who failed or were intolerant of amphotericin B with liposomal amphotericin B (up to 3.0 mg/kg/day intravenously for 1-59 days). 1 patient died of advanced cryptococcal meningitis before drug-treatment effect could be determined; 8 remaining patients responded clinically to treatment. Cryptococci were eradicated in 6/8 patients; time to clearance from CSF was 7-15 days. Ruf treated 3 patients with AIDS-related disseminated cryptococcal infection with liposomal amphotericin B. All 3 people initially received 1 mg/kg intravenously, increased to 3 mg/kg intravenously by day 5 for 42 days. All showed complete mycologic and clinical responses. Side-effects include increased creatinine requiring stopping treatment in one patient during week 3 (restarted at 2 mg/kg and creatinine subsequently became normal) and thrombophlebitis which developed in one patients's right arm at week 3 and which resolved after catheter was changed to other arm. Graybill randomized 3 cohorts, each consisting of 10 people with cryptococcal meningitis, to receive either Amphotericin B Lipid Complex (ABLC) or amphotericin B (AmB). Participants received total doses of either ABLC 46.8 mg/kg, 95 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg or AmB 24.2 mg/kg. Of the 20 evaluable participants receiving ABLC, 11/20 responded to therapy, 9/20 had quiescent disease. 7/7 evaluable AmB recipients responded. No apparent haematologic toxicity or nephrotoxicity was noted. Bozzette (1991 a) treated 14 people who had completed standard amphotericin B therapy (with or without flucytosine) for cryptococcal meningitis fluconazole mg/day. 7/14 responded overall. was associated with fluconazole doses above 100 mg/day. Joly reported that in mice infected with Cryptococcus, the addition of gamma interferon enhanced the therapeutic effect of a low dose of amphotericin B (0.25 mg/kg) as measured by survival time and CFU counts in the brain (but not in the spleen or lung). Research on prophylaxis & maintenance Nightingale routinely treated HIV-positive people who had CD4 counts below 68 with fluconazole (100 mg/day) to prevent disseminated fungal infections. 329 patients who have received fluconazole prophylaxis were compared to an historical control of 337 patients with CD4 counts below 68 who did not receive prophylaxis. 1/329 patients in the fluconazole group and 16/337 in the historical control no-treatment group developed cryptococcosis. Development of histoplasmosis were equivalent in the two groups. Powderly enrolled 189 people who had recovered from cryptococcal meningitis in a comparison of fluconazole (200 mg by mouth every day for 12 months) to amphotericin B (1 mg/kg per week for 12 months) for maintenance (ACTG 026). After 286 days follow up, 2/111 receiving fluconazole and 14/78 receiving amphotericin B had relapsed. Toxicity requiring withdrawal of treatment was more frequent in the amphotericin B group. Zuger treated 13 people with cryptococcal meningitis with amphotericin B and then continued the drug for maintenance (40 to 100 mg intravenous per week, for 6 to 77 weeks). Two patients relapsed (at 6 and 13 weeks). Most patients developed infusion-related fever, nausea and chills. Sugar treated 20 patients with AIDS, 19 of whom had cryptococcal meningitis, with fluconazole (50-200 mg/day) as treatment of cryptococcal meningitis with amphotericin B. In all but one, CSF and blood cultures remained sterile for up to 21 months (median 11 months). Two patients relapsed. Fluconazole had to be discontinued in one patient who developed thrombocytopenia. Bozzette (1991b) conducted a double blind, placebo-controlled trial in 61 patients of fluconazole (either 100 mg or 200 mg) as maintenance therapy for cryptococcal meningitis. 10/27 placebo recipients and 1/34 fluconazole recipients relapsed. Witt reported that people with Cryptococcus strains with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole were more likely to experience failure of primary therapy with fluconazole. Viviani reported no relapses while using itraconazole (3 mg/kg by mouth) as maintenance therapy in 7 AIDS patients with cryptococcosis. 234 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS Dr David Warnock at the Dept of Mycology at Bristol Royal Infirmary and colleagues at the Bristol Dental Hospital are studying the emergence of -azole resistance in people with HIV. Cartledge reported that, although pentamidine inhibits Cryptoccus in vitro, a retrospective study of patients receiving various forms of PCP prophylaxis at a clinic over a three-year period showed that the 18 cases of meningitis which had occurred were evenly distributed among people receiving the various forms of PCP prophylaxis, with no evidence of any protective effect from aerosolised pentamidine.

SCryptosporidiosis Cryptosporidiosis (sometimes called 'crypto' for short - but not to be confused with cryptococcal meningitis) was first reported in humans in 1976. It is caused by the parasite Cryptosporidium parvum, which has been found in 15% of people with AIDS in the US, 30% in Europe and 50% in Africa and Haiti. Symptoms and diagnosis Cryptosporidium lives on the lining of the intestines. It appears to stimulate the secretion of fluids into the intestines and to reduce the absorption of food. This results in diarrhoea, which may be mild or may be excessive. This causes poor nutrition through the loss of nutrients as well as dehydration. Other symptoms may be nausea, cramping abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight loss and excessive wind. Only in people with immune suppression does it cause severe and prolonged diarrhoea. It can also attack the tubes from the liver, causing abdominal pain and jaundice. There have also been a few cases of cryptosporidiosis of the lungs in people with AIDS, which resembles PCP, and in the nasal passages. Cryptosporidiosis is normally diagnosed by testing a sample of stool (faeces) for the organisms or performing a rectal biopsy, a simple, painless procedure. Avoiding infection Cryptosporidiosis may result from being exposed to the organism for the first time, or from the activation of latent infection. There are three major ways people can become infected with Cryptosporidium and, although this knowledge has mainly been gained from studying people with healthy immune systems, and often children, it does have implications for those whose immune systems have been damaged by HIV. Studies have shown that Cryptosporidium can spread from one person to another when there is diarrhoea. This information came from a study of a nursery. Often, cases of cryptosporidiosis can occur in people who come into contact with farm animals. This can be through unpasteurised milk, or muck spreading, on a farm, particularly outside the UK. And even water in some urban areas can be contaminated with Cryptosporidium, as was found in 1990 in Oxford. It is possible to take steps to avoid infection. However, it is important to remember that a significant proportion of people with AIDS are already latently infected with Cryptosporidium. All the following points are the 'counsel of perfection' and need not always be followed to the letter: Tap water should be boiled or avoided. Bottled water is not necessarily free from Cryptosporidium. It may be best to avoid unpasteurised milk and milk products. People with symptomatic HIV infection should avoid farm animals and their excreta, which includes animal manure for gardening. Organically grown vegetables are often grown in raw manure, so it makes sense to brush off as much dirt as possible and then clean any vegetable that isn't peeled with clean water. It is not clear whether domestic pets might pose a similar risk. Use gloves when cleaning up after them and emptying litter trays. Children with diarrhoea due to cryptosporidiosis should be kept away from other children until the diarrhoea has been controlled. Treatment Treatment for cryptosporidiosis is not easy because it has a waxy membrane which prevents drugs getting in. To date over 70 different drugs have been tested against cryptosporidiosis with only limited success. It is also difficult to be clear from the studies that have taken place whether apparently beneficial drugs simply stopped the diarrhoea without eradicating cryptosporidiosis or whether they actually eradicated it. And there is evidence that in some cases, particularly in people with CD4 cell counts over 180, cryptosporidiosis is self-limiting and clears up on its own, regardless of treatment, within 4 weeks. There are two main approaches to treatment - antibiotics like azithromycin, erythromycin, paromomycin, spiramycin (available on a named patient basis) and letrazuril, and immune boosters or substitutes, such as interleukin-2, bovine colostrum, or DLE. Promising results have been reported using paromomycin, but its use, like that of the other agents, is still considered experimental. The lack of a proven effective treatment means that therapy often consists of symptomatic control measures. Anti-diarrhoea drugs like imodium, codeine and slow-release morphine may be prescribed. These are very safe drugs and the art is to take about as much as is needed to improve the diarrhoea. In addition, pain-relieving agents and anti-spasmodic agents may be used for the colic which may also improve the diarrhoea. Food supplements that are predigested may be helpful: these are not to everyone's taste but may help prevent weight loss. Fluid replacement is even more important than food replacement in the short term. Both food and fluid are sometimes given via a Hickman line. Good nursing and general care are especially important. Research Gillson reported that contamination of the water supply resulted in 400,000 cases of cryptosporidiosis in Milwaukee in April 1993. Among 73 HIV-positive people with CD4 counts below 200 living in the city at the time of the contamination, 33 (45%) developed cryptosporidiosis. The overall 6 month mortality rate was 26%; mortality in patients with cryptosporidiosis was significantly higher than in unaffected patients (39% versus 15%). Cryptosporidiosis was responsible for 68% of all deaths in the cohort; 52% of patients with cryptosporidiosis were either dead or terminally ill at 6 months. 12/13 deaths occurred in people with CD4 counts below 50. Kherallah reported that 7/25 people with CD4 counts below 50 who contracted cryptosporidiosis developed biliary disease, with an average time to death of 8.7 months. Among historical controls with biliary disease the A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 235 [Page 236](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/242?q1=directories) average time to death was 17 months. The difference was attributed to the high inoculum of Cryptosporidium in the water supply. Flanigan reported on 13 out of 47 HIV seropositive people with diarrhoea and the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts who had self-limiting cryptosporidiosis. All 8 patients with CD4 counts of 180 or more cleared the infection spontaneously without antiretroviral therapy within 7 days to 1 month. 5 out of 39 people with CD4 counts less than 180 had self-limited disease, of whom 4/5 were started on AZT therapy at the time cryptosporidiosis was diagnosed. In patients with CD4 counts of less than 140, 87% (n=34) developed persistent disease. McGowan reported that 11 out of 38 HIV seropositive patients with dinrrhoea found to be shedding Cryptosporidium oocysts had a spontaneous clinical remission. The mean lymphocyte count in patients with remission was significantly higher (119) than in the non-remission group (62). These findings have important implications for the design of anticryptosporidial therapeutic trials, where the possibility of spontaneous clinical remission must be considered. Rehg reported that azithromycin is active against Cryptosporidia in immunosuppressed rats. A double-blind placebo-controlled study of azithromycin (escalating from 900 mg/day) for cryptosporidiosis is underway at Cornell Medical Center. Patients who do not respond are crossed over to an open-label extension of the study. Preliminary observations of 13 patients suggest some patients respond and most tolerate the treatment well. A multi-center, open-label study of azithromycin for patients with cryptosporidiosis who have failed other treatments is under way. Victor reported that letrazuril (50 mg daily for 7 days) eliminated Cryptosporidium oocysts from the stool of a man with advanced HIV disease and crytposporidial diarhhoea. Harris conducted a Phase I study of letrazuril (50 - 100 mg/day orally for 6 weeks). Of 14 evaluable recipients with CD4 count sranging from 5 to 99, five had symptomatic improvement and eradication of Cryptosporidium oocysts from the stool, two had symptomatic imrpvement withour eradication of oocysts, and seven did not respond. Seven developed a transient drug-related rash. Blanshard assessed the efficacy of azithromycin, paromomycin and letrazuril in the treatment of AIDS patients with cryptosporidiosis for longer than 1 month. Outcome was assessed by a 50% reduction in stool consistency, volume (sv) and frequency (sf), numbers of cryptosporidial oocysts in the stool, and on rectal and duodenal biopsies. Azithromycin (1 g on day 1, then 500 mg for 2-4 weeks) was ineffective at this dose, producing no change in 13/15 patients. In 2 patients diarrhoea stopped but Cryptosporidia were found in the stools (1) or rectal biopsy (1). Cryptosporidia disappeared from the stool in 9/10 patients treated with letrazuril (50 mg/day increasing by 50 mg every 2 weeks to 150 mg) and 4 gained weight, but only 2 showed a reduction in sv and post-treatment gut biopsies showed Cryptosporidia in all 7. 9/10 patients treated with paromomycin (500 mg four times daily for 1 month) had a reduction in sf, 6/10 in sv and 6 gained weight, but Crytosporidia continued to be excreted in 5 and was found in the others on gut biopsy. Two small placebo-controlled studies, and several larger uncontrolled studies, suggest that paromomycin may be effective in controlling the symptoms of cryptosporidiosis. White randomized ten people with cryptosporidiosis to receive paromomycin (25-35 mg/kg/day) or placebo for 14 days, at which point participants crossed over to the alternate arm. Significant improvements in stool frequency and character and oocyst secretion were observed while patients received paromomycin. Kanyok randomised eleven people with AIDS and cryptosporidiosis to receive paromomycin (500 mg every 6 hours) or placebo. After 14 days of treatment, one of 5 paromomycin recipients had a complete response, one had a partial response, and three had no response (2/3 of the non-responders were co-infected with Microsporidium). None of 6 patients randomized to placebo had a response. Walmsley treated 89 people with AIDS and cryptosporidiosis with paromomycin (1500 - 2000 mg/day) in an open-label study. Complete responses were observed in 31/89 (35%), partial responses in 38/89 (43%), and no response in 20/89 (22%). Microbiological eradication was documented in 21/51 participants tested. Ramratnam enrolled 39 people in a open unrandomized study of paromomycin (500 mg four times a day). 26 completed 4 weeks treatment. The main reason for stopping treatment was the development of other opportunistic infections. After 4 weeks, 18/39 had gained weight and 19 had improvement or resolution of their diarrhoea. Of those who completed the full 4 weeks treatment, all but one had a complete or partial response, and in half of them Cryptosporidium organisms could no longer be detected in samples of faeces. Drake reported that 40 patients with AIDS and a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis received paromomycin (500 mg orally four times daily) for a mean of 25 days. In this uncontrolled open-label study, the number of daily bowel movements was observed to decrease in 27/40 patients, and gastrointestinal symptoms improved during therapy. 236 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS Gathe evaluated 23 patients (retrospective chart review) with cryptosporidiosis who had been treated with paromomycin (1500-2000 mg/day for a median of 14 days). 16/23 patients had a complete response, 7/23 had a partial response. Seven of the complete responders had negative stool cultures after treatment. No haematologic, hepatic, renal or CNS toxicity was noted. Clezy treated five AIDS patients with lab-documented cryptosporidiosis with paromomycin (1500 or 2000 mg by mouth every day if patients weighed less than 60 kg or more than 60 kg respectively). Diarrhoea improved significantly in all patients within one week of treatment. Improvements were maintained through four weeks for all patients. Oocysts were detectable in 4/5 patients during treatment. No toxicities or side-effects were observed. Armitage successfully treated 5 people with cryptosporidiosis with oral paromomycin (1500 to 2000 mg/day). All 5 had resolution of symptoms and normalization of bowel movements, although one later relapsed while receiving paromomycin. 3/5 cleared Cryptosporidium from the stool. Fichtenbaum treated 7 people with cryptosporidiosis with paromomycin (500 mg orally every 6 hours) for an average of 11.7 days. The mean follow-up period was 3.2 months. All had an initial response to paromomycin characterized by a decrease in frequency of diarrheal episodes, stabilization of body weight and/or eradication of cryptosporidia from the stool. The mean number of diarrheal episodes decreased from 10.9 to 1.7 daily. Stabilization or increase in body weight was noted for 5/7 and eradication of oocysts was documented for 3. Relapses or recurrences were noted for 3 participants. Treatment was well tolerated with the exception of 2 people who experienced nausea and abdominal discomfort. Connolly (1988) treated 15 patients in a randomised trial of erythromycin (500 mg by mouth every day) versus spiramycin (500 mg by mouth every day). 6/10 given erythromycin and all patients given spiramycin showed a reduction in stool volume. Therapy was limited in both groups by nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Soave treated 68 patients in a placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study (with crossover to open-label treatment for non-responders) of diclazuril (50-600 mg by mouth for 7 days); at the highest dose, limited efficacy was observed. Poor bioavailability may limit diclazuril's efficacy. Connolly (1990) treated 9 critically ill AIDS patients with cryptosporidial diarrhoea with diclazuril (200 mg or 400 mg per day). Five died during treatment but no direct toxic effects of the drug were apparent. Stool volumes remained unchanged throughout treatment. In the 5 patients who completed the treatment Cryptosporidia were still identified in stools. Comparison of rectal biopsies of 6 patients before and after treatment (1 patient was initially negative) showed clearance of oocysts in 1 case. Fanning suggested that octreotide may be less effective in controlling cryptosporidiosis than other causes of diarrhoea in people with AIDS. Fries reported two trials of hyperimmune bovine colostrum. In the first 40 participants received either colostrum (20 g/day) or placebo for one week; all participants received colostrum during the second week. The treatment had no effect on stool frequency, volume or mean oocyst counts, but the group which received 2 weeks treatment experienced a significant fall in median oocyst count during the second week. No adverse events were noted. In the second trial participants received colostrum at 20 g/day escalating to 40 g/day and 80 g/day at weekly intervals if diarrhoea persisted. The 80 g/day dose caused unacceptable bloating and/or increased diarrhoea in some participants. No effect on stool volume or frequency was noted, although there was a trend to reduction in median oocyst counts. Bicart-See treated 13 people with chronic severe cryptosporidial diarrhoea with hyperimmune bovine colostrum (continuous infusion of 25 cm3/hour for 60 hours). Diarrhoea and oocysts shedding did not improve in any of 3 people treated with colostrum with a low titre of IgG to Cryptosporidium. 2/2 people treated with a medium titre colostrum expereinced a 50% reduction in stool volume and oocyst shedding. Of those treated with high titre colostrum, 2/8 recovered and remained oocyst-free, 4/8 experienced a transient (15-30 days) reduction in stool volume and low oocyst shedding and 2/8 had no improvement. No adverse events were noted. McMeeking treated 14 patients with cryptosporidiosis with either an immunised bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract (immune DLE) or non-immune DLE as placebo. 6/7 patients treated with immune DLE gained weight and had a decrease in bowel movement frequency, with eradication of oocysts from stool in 5/7 patients. 6/7 patients given placebo failed to gain weight, and 5/7 continued to lose weight. 4 showed no clearing of oocysts from stool. Five original placebo recipients were switched to immune DLE; four had a decrease in bowel-movement frequency and significant weight gain, with eradication of oocysts from stool in 2 patients. Louie treated 8 AIDS patients for cryptosporidiosis with transfer factor from cows with immunity to Cryptosporidium. Five patients had a decreased number of bowel movements and developed formed stools; two of those five relapsed. [Page 237](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/243?q1=directories) Sluiters reported the failure of hyperimmune bovine colostrum (20 ml/hour for 12 days) to influence the number of oocysts, number of stools, stool volume or weight of 2 people with AIDS-related cryptosporidiosis. Cook treated an AIDS patient for cryptosporidiosis diarrhoea with a somatostatin analogue, SMS-201-995 (100 g subcutaneously three times a day). The patient had reduced stool volume and frequency and remained diarrhoea-free for 8 months with continued daily treatment. Cryptosporidial infection remained unchanged. Simon treated another cryptosporidiosis patient with a somatostatin anclogue. Cryptosporidiosis resolved in this patient, which the investigators attributed to improved immune functioning resulting from improved nutritional status. Somatostatin is thought to inhibit intestinal secretion and enhance water and electrolyte absorption but not control the parasite. Francesco reported successfully treating 4 AIDS patients with cryptosporidiosis with fluconazole. A phase I cross-over trial of atovaquone (750 mg by mouth four times a day) for cryptosporidiosis was conducted at the NIH in the USA. No toxicity was observed, although, since most of these patients suffer from severe malabsorption, the lack of toxicity might reflect low systemic drug levels. This trial was halted when no difference was seen between the treatment and placebo arms. References Armitage K et al. Treatment of cryptosporidiosis with paromomycin.

SCytomegalovirus Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the herpes family of viruses. It is relatively common throughout the adult population (up to 50%), but occurs in a higher proportion of gay men (up to 95%) and drug users (64%). Like the other herpes viruses, it is transmitted sexually in semen and vaginal secretions, through blood or saliva, through organ transplants and from mother to baby before or during birth, or through breast-milk. Symptoms In most people with fully functioning immune systems, initial infection with CMV may cause a mild flu-like illness, but afterwards it is kept dormant. If the immune system is damaged, as in people with advanced HIV disease, it can be reactivated. In immunosuppressed people CMV can cause disease in a number of different parts of the body. In rare cases, people with quite high CD4 counts can also experience CMV-related disease. CMV retinitis is infection of the back of the eye, causing the retina to become swollen and inflamed. This means that the signals sent from the eye to the brain become incomplete or inaccurate, leading to blurring of vision and/or blind spots. If left untreated, the retina can become scarred, leaving permanent damage to the eyesight or even no vision at all. A very early sign of CMV retinitis may be the appearance of 'floaters' in the vision, visual hallucination of flashing lights, a misting of vision, or blurred or dark areas in the side vision. Any of these symptoms require urgent examination by someone experienced in looking at CMV retinitis such as an ophthalmologist (an eye specialist) as it may require special instruments to view the back of your eyes. This is urgent, as it is important to start treatment straight away. The doctor should be looking at the back of the eye every few days during treatment to make sure that things are improving. A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 237 [Page 238](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/244?q1=directories) Gastrointestinal CMV infection can lead to colitis (inflammation of the bowel), cholangitis (inflammation of the bile duct) and ulceration in the mouth, throat or around the rectum. These conditions can result in diarrhoea (often containing blood), fever, abdominal pain and weight loss. CMV in the brain can lead to CMV encephalopathy. CMV can often be found in the lungs of people with advanced AIDS but this only rarely seems to cause problems, usually in combination with PCP. It can also sometimes affect the peripheral nerves, causing pain with numbness and weakness beginning in the legs which then spreads upwards, affecting bowel and urinary function. Polyradiculopathy, also known as Cauda Equina syndrome, has also been linked to CMV. This is thought to be caused by CMV infection of the spinal cord, causing symptoms of loss of feeling in the lower limbs, urine retention, and loss of reflexes. This condition is often fatal unless it is treated very promptly indeed. Diagnosis CMV disease can be hard to diagnose from symptoms alone, and often requires the virus to be detected in biopsy samples. CMV-infected cells can be identified under the microscope in samples of colon, oesophagus (throat) or lung tissue. Special stains that react with CMV may be used. Doctors may try to grow (or 'culture') CMV from blood, tissue or urine samples, but this can take several weeks and in any case a positive result does not necessarily establish that CMV is the cause of any specific symptoms. Culture is therefore only usually used to help confirm a diagnosis based on symptoms and examination of biopsy samples. CMV retinitis is usually diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination of the eye. Early lesions appear as small yellow-white patches with a grainy appearance, often with accompanying bleeding. There are blood tests for antibodies to CMV, but these antibodies may be absent in people with severe CMV disease, making them of little diagnostic value. Treatment and maintenance The two approved treatments for CMV retinitis are ganciclovir and foscarnet. Both are currently produced for slow injected infusion form only, although a tablet version of ganciclovir and a drinkable liquid version of foscarnet are currently being tested. Ganciclovir was licensed for the treatment of CMV retinitis in June 1989. It has been shown to be quite effective at stabilising sight. The standard dose is 5 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours for 10 to 14 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg intravenously every day. It also seems to be effective for gastrointestinal CMV disease, but CMV encephalopathy appears to respond poorly to ganciclovir. Ganciclovir can also be injected directly into the eye (intravitreal administration). This avoids the need to have a Hickman line and means that the dose of ganciclovir given is much lower, so that bonemarrow side-effects can be avoided. However, injections into the eye can cause problems of their own - like retinal detachment. This procedure is experimental and the drug is not licensed for this purpose. Other researchers are experimenting with devices surgically implanted into the eye which gradually release ganciclovir over time. Ganciclovir can affect the bone marrow causing anaemia and a reduction in some types of white cells (especially neutropenia - a shortage of neutrophils). The anaemia can be treated using blood transfusions, or possibly with growth factors such as GM-CSF and G-CSF. The reduced number of neutrophils could lead to bacterial infections, especially if the drug is being administered by means of a central venous line. The bone-marrow suppressing effects of this drug can be increased if AZT is being taken at the same time; the dose of AZT may therefore need to be reduced, or ddl, which does not affect the bone marrow, used instead. In all, doctors have had to temporarily or permanently discontinue ganciclovir in a significant proportion of treated people. Foscarnet is usually given at a dose of 60 mg/kg intravenously every 8 hours for 14 - 21 days followed a maintenance dose of 90 mg/kg every day. Foscarnet does not seem to cause suppression of the bone marrow, but its side-effects do include kidney problems, seizures, anaemia and serious imbalances in certain minerals such as abnormally low levels of calcium or abnormally high levels of magnesium and phosphate. Men (especially the uncircumcised) may develop ulcers of the penis from the foscarnet that is excreted in their urine; the risk of this can be minimised by careful washing of the penis after urination. A high proportion of people treated with foscarnet also develop severe nausea. In a trial comparing foscarnet with ganciclovir, both were equally effective in treating CMV retinitis. In addition patients who received foscarnet lived an average of 4 months longer than those on ganciclovir - perhaps because foscarnet also has a direct anti-HIV activity, or because a number of the people receiving ganciclovir had to stop taking AZT (Meinert, below). An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested that the best treatment for CMV retinitis is therefore foscarnet, or, if kidney problems develop, ganciclovir with an anti-retroviral drug such as ddl, whose toxicities do not overlap with those of ganciclovir. Experimental treatments for CMV include the combination of ganciclovir and foscarnet. Some research suggests that the drugs are synergistic i.e. the combination is more effective than would be expected by simply adding together the effects of the two drugs. Other approaches include monoclonal antibodies which are genetically engineered to neutralise CMV and a number of new oral anti-CMV drugs, which are discussed below. In particular, studies suggest that oral ganciclovir may be as effective as intravenous ganciclovir in preventing CMV retinitis relapses. As these treatments at best prevent CMV from reproducing and infecting new cells but do not eliminate the virus from the body, people who have had an episode of CMV disease is treated then require long term maintenance therapy (secondary prophylaxis) with lower doses of the treatment drugs to prevent a relapse. This may require the insertion of a permanent line into a vein in the chest to make the infusions easier to manage at home. Prophylaxis There is no established prophylaxis to prevent a first episode of CMV disease in people with low CD4 counts. 238 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS [Page 239](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/245?q1=directories) Intravenous ganciclovir has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of CMV disease in people who have been deliberately immunosuppressed for organ transplantation. However, the inconvenience, risk of infections of the transfusion line and the side-effects of ganciclovir and foscarnet, however, mean that these drugs are considered to be unsuitable to be taken for prolonged periods as primary prophylaxis. There is therefore considerable interest in the development of oral anti-CMV drugs which might be useful for both treatment and prophylaxis. Clinical trials are underway to assess a number of oral drugs which may be useful for CMV prophylaxis. Preliminary results from a study of oral ganciclovir suggested that it halved the rate of development of CMV retinitis compared with a placebo; other studies are ongoing. Initial trials of a liquid oral foscarnet have also taken place. Researchers are particularly interested in this drug, because foscarnet also inhibits HIV replication, but is too toxic in its intravenous form to be used as a long term anti-HIV treatment. However, the liquid formulation also caused significant gastrointestinal upsets. Cidofovir (formerly known as HPMPC) is a new nucleotide analogue active in vitro against herpes simplex and CMV. In the test-tube it is effective against CMV strains that have become resistant to ganciclovir, and in studies against mouse CMV it kept the animals alive for significantly longer than ganciclovir. It also remains in the body for relatively long periods after each dose, and in tablet form appears to be quite well-absorbed into the body. All these considerations hold out promise that cidofovir may be an effective oral anti-CMV drug which could be taken at relatively infrequent intervals. High doses of the anti-herpes drug acyclovir have been reported to inhibit the growth of CMV. Placebo-controlled trials using intravenous acyclovir appear to have demonstrated that the drug can reduce the likelihood of reactivation of CMV disease in bone-marrow or kidney transplant recipients; however, it seems not to be possible to get high enough doses of acyclovir into the body using the tablet version. The Anglo-Australian study 325 was stopped in December 1991 because participants treated with high-dose oral acyclovir were no less likely to develop CMV disease than placebo-recipients (although they did appear to live longer). Valaciclovir is an acyclovir 'prodrug' produced by Wellcome. It rapidly breaks down into acyclovir in the body, producing higher levels of acyclovir in the blood than can be achieved with oral tablets of acyclovir. The US AIDS Clinical Trials Group is conducting a trial of valaciclovir compared with two doses of acyclovir for CMV prophylaxis, in conjunction with European and Australian centres. In Britain, this study, known as ACTG 204, is taking place at the Royal Free Hospital and the Kobler Centre in London. Co-factor In 1989 doctors from the Royal Free Hospital in London published evidence from their cohort of people with haemophilia that suggested CMV may act as a co-factor to HIV, speeding up progression to AIDS in individuals who were infected with both viruses. CMV may activate HIV and cause further replication. Additionally, it has also been suggested that CMV may allow HIV to infect cells which do not have CD4 receptors: this would reduce the beneficial activity of drugs that work by blocking CD4 viral binding. However, more recent studies have failed to find any link between CMV and increased risk of progression. In early 1994 the Royal Free team also presented updated figures on their cohort. Men who had CMV as well as HIV tended to be significantly older than those who were HIV-positive but were not also infected with CMV, and older age has been shown by many studies to be associated with faster disease progression. When the analysis was adjusted to take account, of this difference, the Royal Free researchers found that the effect on CMV fell just below the conventional level of statistical significance i.e. it could have been due simply to chance. Several other studies presented at the 10th International Conference on AIDS in Yokohama in 1994 also failed to find any evidence that CMV accelerates HIV disease progression in people with haemophilia or in non-hemophilic people. Nevertheless, some trials have suggested that drugs that act against herpes viruses such as foscarnet and acyclovir may prolong the survival of people with HIV. A study is underway in London to see whether high dose acyclovir or valaciclovir, which may keep CMV inactive, can slow down HIV disease progression. Another study of high-dose acyclovir was stopped after 48 weeks because although high-dose acyclovir was not reducing the incidence of CMV disease in the acyclovir-treated participants compared with those receiving placebo, the survival of participants receiving acyclovir was significantly higher than that of placebo-recipients. This trial is reported in detail in the entry on acyclovir. Research on CMV as a co-factor In 1989 Lee reported that in a population of 111 people with haemophilia with well defined seroconversion dates, co-infection with CMV increased the rate of progression to symptomatic HIV infection. However, in 1994 Sabin reported that after updated figures were adjusted to take account of the fact that CMV-infected men were older than CMV-negative men, the effect of CMV infection on disease progression did not show statistical significance. Rabkin reported that among 393 people with known dates of HIV seroconversion in the National Cancer Institute Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study Group, CMV seropositivity was not associated with an increased risk of progression to AIDS, although a non-significant trend to shorter survival in CMV-positive individuals was observed. Hatzakis reported that in a Greek cohort study of 158 HIV-positive haemophiliacs, no link between CMV infection and increased risk of disease progression could be detected. In common with many studies, the only detectable co-factor that seemed to affect the risk of developing AIDS was age, with people who were over 40 at increased risk. 13 years after infection, 64% of the group had not developed AIDS and 19% were still entirely symptom-free. Salmon-Ceron reported the results of a French cohort study examining rates of disease progression among 501 non-haemophilic people who had both HIV and CMV compared with 66 who had HIV but no CMV. A second analysis compared the 66 CMV-negative participants with 17 people who became infected with CMV during the study. No CMV-related difference in progression to symptomatic disease, AIDS or a CD4 count below 200 could be detected. The only significant co-factor was age, with older people experiencing faster disease progression than younger people. Aurelian reviewed the mechanisms by which CMV gene products appear to be able to directly up-regulate the HIV long terminal repeat in cells which are co-infected. Youle enrolled 302 CMV seropositive patients with advanced symptomatic HIV disease and CD4 counts below 150 (mean baseline CD4 count was 51 in the treated and 56 in the placebo group) in an international study of the efficacy of acyclovir in preventing CMV and other herpes virus diseases (study H14-325). Participants received oral acyclovir (800 mg four times daily) or placebo. The proportions of participants in each treatment group spending greater than 50%, 50-80% and 80-100% of their total time receiving an effective antiretroviral regimen were similar, namely 22 and 16% (placebo and acyclovir), 15 and 20%, and 63 and 64% respectively. At week 48 the study was stopped on the basis that statistically there was no evidence of a significant decrease in CMV disease occurring in the acyclovir group. At this time CMV disease had occurred in 16/123 patients in the A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 239 [Page 240](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/246?q1=directories) acyclovir group and 9/123 in the placebo group. However, there was a statistically significant reduction in mortality in the high-dose acyclovir arm: 43/149 placebo recipients died (29%), the acyclovir group (18%). On an intention-to-treat analysis the overall probability of dying was 39% in the placebo group versus 23% in the acyclovir group; for those with CD4 counts below 50 the probability of dying was 56% vs 32%. Research on CMV retinitis Spector randomized 35 people with peripheral CMV retinitis receive either immediate treatment with intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily for 14 weeks), or deferred treatment. People randomized to deferred treatment whose retinitis progressed were offered ganciclovir. 20/22 people randomized to deferred treatment were found to have progressive CMV retinitis compared with 10/13 randomized to immediate treatment. The median time to progression in the deferred treatment group, as determined by masked fundoscopy, was 1 3.5 days compared with 49.5 days in the immediate treatment group). These data indicate that ganciclovir delays the progression of CMV peripheral retinitis in people with AIDS. Palestine randomised 24 people with previously untreated CMV retinitis who were at low risk for loss of their visual acuity to receive either no therapy (delayed treatment or immediate treatment with intravenous foscarnet at a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight three times a day for 3 weeks (induction regimen) followed by a maintenance regimen of 90 mg/kg once a day. The mean time to progression of retinitis was 3.2 weeks in the control group of 11 people compared with 13.3 weeks in the treatment group of 13 people. Nine of 13 people in the treatment group had positive blood cultures for CMV at entry and all nine cleared their blood of CMV by the end of the induction period compared with one of six people in the control group. No reductions in p24 levels were seen in the control patients compared with a reduction of more than 50% in p24 levels for all four patients on treatment for whom follow-up levels were available. The main adverse effects of foscarnet were seizures (2/13 participants, hypomagnesemia (9/13), hypocalcemia 13). Meinert compared ganciclovir with foscarnet in the treatment of CMV retinitis in 234 patients with AIDS (ACTG 129). 127 patients received ganciclovir (induction therapy of 5 mg/kg every 12 hours for 14 days, followed by maintenance therapy of 5 mg/kg/day) and 107 patients received foscarnet (induction therapy of 60 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14 days, followed by maintenance therapy of 90 mg/kg/day). At 19 months, 65 of the patients assigned to ganciclovir had died (51%) compared with 36 patients assigned to foscarnet (34%). The median survival was 8.5 months in the ganciclovir group and 12.6 months in the foscarnet group. This survival benefit could not be attributed to differences in anti-retroviral therapy between the two groups. In the foscarnet group, the only subgroup of patients identified as having excess mortality were those whose renal function was compromised on entry. There was no difference between the two treatment groups in the rate of progression of retinitis. Harb reviewed 168 patients with AIDS and CMV disease diagnosed between 1985 and October 1989. Median survival before 30 September 1987 was 4 months, compared with 9 months for cases diagnosed after 30 September 1987. No improved survival was associated with foscarnet therapy compared with ganciclovir. Polis (1990) treated 24 AIDS patients with CMV retinitis with foscarnet (60 mg/kg intravenous every 8 hours). Overall, median survival of AIDS patients with CMV retinitis was approximately 10 months. Retrospective studies have shown that the median survival of AIDS patients with CMV retinitis, foscarnet for ganciclovir-intolerant subjects, despite treatment, is approximately 5 months. Jacobson (1994) treated 156 people with CMV retinitis who were intolerant of or resistant to ganciclovir with foscarnet salvage therapy (60, 90 or 120 mg/kg/day). Median time to progression on foscarnet therapy was 8 weeks at all doses studied, whereas previous studies of ganciclvori and foscarnet have demonstrated retinitis progression 2-3 weeks after therapy with either drug has been terminated. Overall median survival was 25 weeks and did not differ between the dose groups. Moderate-to-severe drug toxicities occurred in 94-96% of foscarnet recipients. There were no significant differences in serious drug-related toxicity between the dose groups, although trends toward increased renal and hypocalcemic adverse events were observed at higher maintenance doses. Jacobson (1991) reported the successful treatment of CMV retinitis with foscarnet in two people who had developed ganciclovir-resistant strains of CMV. Manischewitz reported that the combination of ganciclovir and foscarnet is synergistic in vitro. Jacobson (1992) treated 30 CMV-retinitis patients with either combined or alternating ganciclovir and foscarnet after two weeks induction therapy with either drug alone. Patients were randomized to either ganciclovir (3.75 mg/kg each day) plus foscarnet (60 mg/kg each day) or ganciclovir (6 mg/kg/day) alternating daily with foscarnet (120 mg/kg/day). 27/30 patients were evaluable; 12 in the combination group, 15 in the alternating group. 10/12 combination patients had retinitis progression compared to 240 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 7/15 on the alternating regimen. Median time to retinitis progression was more than 12 weeks versus more than 20 weeks for the combination and alternating groups, respectively. Grade 4 neutropenia was seen in 6/12 patients on the combination and 4/15 on alternating regimen. Dieterich treated 10 AIDS patients with CMV infection who failed both foscarnet or ganciclovir with the combination of foscarnet and ganciclovir. Patients received a second induction course with either foscarnet (5 people) or ganciclovir (5 people) alone followed by the combination (foscarnet 120 mg/kg and ganciclovir 5 mg/kg) for a mean duration of 91 days (range 34-190 days). 9/10 responded to the combination treatment; median survival was 174.5 days. No difference in the development of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia was seen when comparing monotherapy to the combination although the risk of developing anaemia was more than twice as high on the combination. Tomlinson treated 5/35 people with AIDS (14.3%) presenting with acute CMV infection with dual agent therapy with foscarnet (200 mg/kg for 14 days) and ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days) as they had either relapsed shortly after completing induction with a single agent or had progressive disease despite continued single agent induction. All of these patients had retinitis and in addition, 1 had hepatitis and 1 had CMV radiculopathy. Response occurred in all 5 patients with no increased toxicity. Kuppermann treated 9 people who had failed monotherapy with ganciclovir or foscarnet with combinations of the two drugs at various doses. All nine exhibited a favorable response. 7/9 participants remained on therapy for more than 6 weeks; two voluntarily stopped combination therapy because of the inconvenience of the dosing regimen and resumed monotherapy. Salzberger treated 13 people with disease with daily, foscarnet mg/kg intravenously twice daily). was successful in 7/7 participants with CMV retinitis, 3/5 with colitis and 2/2 with esophagitis. Reversible renal toxicity was seen in 2 patients. Hardy enrolled 51 patients with CMV-retinitis in a phase II safety, tolerance and efficacy study (ACTG 073) of ganciclovir (GCV) and GM-CSF versus ganciclovir alone. Twenty two subjects received the GCV/GM-CSF combination and 29 received GCV alone. 15/22 GCV/GM-CSF recipients and 12/29 GCV recipients also had AZT (600 mg/day) after 16 weeks of study. GCV/AZT subjects who developed neutropenia received GM-CSF for the remainder of the study. Overall, 4/22 (18%) GCV/GM-CSF subjects developed neutropenia compared to Within one year, 19% of GCV/GM-CSF subjects and 60% of GCV subjects had multiple neutropenic episodes. Progression of CMV-retinitis during first 16 weeks (prior to addition of AZT or GM-CSF for neutropenia) was detected in 4/21 and 9/28 (32%) GCV recipients. Crumpacker treated 117 people who had a new diagnosis of CMV retinitis with intravenous ganciclovir for 3 weeks, then if their retinitis was stable randomised them to receive either continued intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg/day) or oral ganciclovir (500 mg six times a day) for 20 weeks. When assessed by fundoscopy, the mena time to progression was 111 days in the intravenous groups and 48 days in the oral group. However, the time to progression was comparable between the two groups when assessed by masked retinal photographs. Oral ganciclovir was well-tolerated with no increase in gastrointestinal side-effects. Neutropenia, fever and sepsis occurred more frequently in the intravenous ganciclovir recipients. Squires enrolled 216 people whose CMV retinitis had been stabilised by at least 4 weeks intravenous therapy to receive maintenace therapy with either continued intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg/day) or oral ganciclovir (3 g/day in either 3 or 6 divided doses). Median time to progression as assessed by fundoscopy was 105 days, 68 days and 56 days respectively. However, again the time to progression was comparable between the treatment groups when assessed by masked retinal photographs. Verdejo treated 29 patients (40 affected eyes) with intravitreal ganciclovir (induction: 200 g twice a week for 3 weeks, maintenance: 200 g each week). After an average of 9 weeks of treatment, progression of CMV-retinitis was observed in 10/33 (33.6%) eyes. Early bi-lateralization of disease occurred in 17.6% of patients. Cribbin treated 30 eyes (27 patients) who demonstrated persistent CMV retinitis despite ganciclovir and/or foscarnet treatment with the addition of intravitreal ganciclovir (400 g every other day for 8 days). 29/30 eyes responded to induction and maintenance treatment. Risks associated with intravitreal ganciclovir include bacterial infection, local haemorrhaging, and detachment of the retina. Cochereau-Massin treated 110 patients (162 affected eyes) on an open-label basis with intravitreal ganciclovir (400 g twice weekly for induction and once weekly for maintenance). All patients were intolerant of or had refused systemic ganciclovir therapy. 141/151 induction courses were successful, with a ten-week relapse rate of 48%. Bi-lateralization of disease occurred in 11%, and extraocular disease developed in 15%. Retinal detachments were observed in 5% and intravitreal haemorrhage in 1%. The investigators suggested that while intravitreal ganciclovir is effective, it should remain a salvage treatment since it is non-systemic. [Page 241](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/247?q1=directories) Polsky reported preliminary data on 9 people with CMV retinitis (13 affected eyes) who were intolerant to systemic ganciclovir treated with intravitreal ganciclovir (200 g twice a week for 3 weeks then once a week for 21 weeks). 10/13 eyes received the complete induction dose and responded. Disease progression occurred in 5 eyes after a mean 6-7 weeks maintenance; 3/5 responded to reinduction. 2 patients (3 eyes) developed extraocular CMV after a mean of 7 weeks. No serious complications have been noted. Anand treated 22 people with CMV retinitis (30 eyes) with a ganciclovir intraocular device. 17/22 patients had documented progression of CMV retinitis despite intravenous ganciclovir before the device was placed, and 5/22 presented with previously untreated CMV retinitis. Participants were followed every 2 weeks until death. 27/30 eyes showed initial stabilization of the retinitis. The median time to disease progression was 133 days. 25% of participants required systemic therapy when they developed symptomatic CMV disease. Nightingale enrolled 8 people with CMV-retinitis (8 affected eyes) into a phase I study of an intraocular ganciclovir drug delivery system. Under local anaesthesia, a 4.5 mm diameter device is placed in the eye which releases 6 mg ganciclovir at the rate of 2 g/hour for 120 days. 9/12 responded completely, 3/12 partially responded, 3 eyes had retinal detachments after surgery. No other complications were noted. Sanborn reported resolution of CMV retinitis in 13/13 eyes treated with intravitreal ganciclovir implants. Retinal detachment occurred in 3 eyes as the retinitis resolved. Lieberman treated a man who experienced progressive CMV retinitis following treatment and maintenance therapy with ganciclovir with intravitreal foscarnet (1200 g in a volume of 0.1 ml every 48 hours; 4 doses over 8 days) without systemic treatment. The recipients vision improved and there was no evidence of continuing active CMV disease. Polls (1993) administered cidofovir (0.5, 1.5 or 5 mg/kg intravenously weekly or twice weekly, with or without probenecid), to 20 HIV-positive asymptomatic people with CMV viruria. CMV urine cultures became negative in 4/6 evaluable participants receiving the highest doses of cidofovir. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be about 5 mg/kg weekly, with proteinuria, glycosuria and creatinine elevations being the dose limiting toxicities. Concomitant probenecid administration appeared to protect against renal toxicity. Palestine (1994) enrolled 16 people with CMV retinitis n patis ents who had failed standard therapy in a phase 1/11 dose-ranging study of ISIS 2922, treated intravitreally with ISIS 2922 (75, 150 or 300 g, targetted to reach intravitreal concntrations of 2, 4 and 8 M respectively) once a week for 4 weeks and every two weeks thereafter. Decreased disease activity was observed in most participants and significant clinical activity was observed within 2 weeks of treatment. CMV retinitis was controlled for 4-26 weeks in some patients receiving mid-dose ranges. The drug was well-tolerated, with eye inflammation the most frequent side-effect. Side-effects were temporary loss of colour vision and ocular discomfort. One participant withdrew because of adverse events. Petersen enrolled 15 HIV-positive people with CMV-positive cultures in a study of TI-23 (40-80 mg/m/day intravenously for 90 days). 13/15 participants completed treatment. 8 participants had CMV-retinitis; 4/8 had progression of disease. Severe fatigue was the most frequently reported side-effect. No-one developed antibodies to TI-23. A study of single-dose induction treatment of TI-23 followed by either foscarnet or ganciclovir is under development. Huang reported that etoposide (VP-16 or VePesid) can irreversibly inhibit CMV replication, through the inhibition of viral DNA and late viral-proteins synthesis, at a concentration (2.5 g/ml) greatly below the toxic levels to stationary phase cells. In vitro etoposide inhibits topoisomerase II, an enzyme essential for CMV to replicate in vitro. Research on CMV colitis & polyradiculopathy Dieterich (1993a) treated 62 CMV colitis with ganciclovir (5 mg/kg intravenously twice daily) or placebo for 14 days. At entry all participants had diarrhoea (more than 6 stools/day), malabsorption or unintentional weight loss of more than 4.5 kg. After 1 4 days, the groups did not differ for clinical end points (diarrhoea, temperature, body weight, abdominal pain, fatigue, serum albumin, cholesterol or magnesium) or for adverse effects. A reduction in colonoscopy scores from baseline to day 14 was seen in 20/32 (62.5%) people treated with ganciclovir compared to 11/30 (36.7%) placebo recipients. CMV disease at new sites developed in seven placebo recipients (5 retinitis, 1 gastritis, 1 pneumonitis) and three ganciclovir recipients (3 gastritis). The investigators suggested that the treatment might be more effective if extended to 21 or 28 days. Dieterich (1993b) treated 10 people, 5 with upper GI CMV disease and 5 with lower GI disease with foscarnet (90 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours). Mild oedema was noted in 2/10 but resolved. 8/10 required 6 weeks of treatment for complete response. 9/10 responded histopathologically and 9/10 responded endoscopically. Blanshard (1992) reported that 3 weeks of foscarnet therapy led to resolution of symptoms and endoscopic findings in 17 of 22 people with CMV oesophagitis (77%) and 16 of 28 people with CMV colitis (57%). Relapse occurred in about a quarter by 7 months. Nelson reported on the treatment of CMV infection of the oesophagus and colon in patients with AIDS with foscarnet. In 15/18 episodes of oesophageal ulceration, there was complete loss of symptoms within 2 weeks, with only 3/15 relapses, 2 of whom were successfully retreated with foscarnet. Of 22 patients experiencing 27 episodes of CMV colitis, 4 died during foscarnet therapy. Of 18 completing the course for first episode CMV colitis, 11 remitted completely and 6 had a partial remission. Only 1 patient receiving a course of foscarnet failed to respond microscopically to treatment. 3 patients experienced relapse of their colitis, 2 of whom responded to further courses of foscarnet. Blanshard (1993) randomized 19 people with CMV GI disease to receive either ganciclovir or foscarnet. Mean duration of treatment was 15 days. Endoscopic improvement was observed in 84% and 81% of ganciclovir and foscarnet subjects, respectively. Adverse drug effects occurred with equal frequency in both groups. Aulitzky treated 13 HIV-positive patients, all of whom had CMV colitis and 8 of whom also had CMV retinitis, for almost one year with monoclonal anti-CMV antibodies genetically constructed from mice antibodies, called TI-23 (40 - 80 mg/day). Retinitis progressed in 4/8 and stabilised in 3/8. GI symptoms resolved in 2/3. No toxicity was observed. Kim summarized 22 previously reported cases of CMV radiculopathy and presented 2 new case reports, of patients with this disease. The most common initial symptom was leg weakness that often progressed in the absence of therapy. Over two thirds of patients experienced urinary retention. Characteristic cerebrospinal fluid findings included very low glucose levels, an increased number of neutrophils, and elevated levels of protein. In almost half the cases, CMV was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. In one third, concurrent CMV retinitis was reported. MRI and CT scans were helpful only to exclude other diagnoses. The average survival for untreated patients was 3 weeks. In contrast, over 50% of ganciclovir-treated patients survived the acue illness with a median survival of 11 weeks. Response to ganciclovir therapy can take more than 2 months. The authors recommend lifelong therapy with either ganciclovir or foscarnet for documented or suspected CMV polyradiculopathy. Research on maintenance A dose-comparison study (ACTG 093) foscarnet (60 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg intravenously every day) for patients who had failed or were intolerant of ganciclovir enrolled 170 subjects. High-dose foscarnet (120 mg/kg intravenously) was more effective in the group that had failed ganciclovir. However, in a subset with documented in vitro resistance to ganciclovir, doses greater than 60 mg/kg/day conferred no added benefit. Crumpacker compared oral (500 mg six times daily) versus intravenous ganciclovir as maintenance therapy in people whose CMV retinitis had been stabilised through use of intravenous ganciclovir. After 20 weeks follow-up, the mean time to progression was 111 days in the IV group and 48 days in the oral group. However, the two treatments seemed to be equally effective when assessment was made by masked fundus photographs. Oral ganciclovir was well-tolerated. Squires randomised people with CMV retinitis that had been treated intravenously for more than 4 weeks to receive maintenance therapy with continued IV ganciclovir or with oral ganciclovir (3 g/day or 6 g/day). After 20 weeks follow-up, the mean time to progression was 105 days in the IV group, 56 days in the 3 g/day oral group and 68 days in the 6 g/day group. Again, however, the two treatments seemd to be equally effective when assessment was made by masked fundus photographs. People who experienced a relapse of retinitis while on study were treated intravenously, then re-randomised to one of the two doses of oral ganciclovir. Preliminary analysis of these patients suggested that 6 g/day delayed progression for longer than 3 g/day. Volker randomised 159 people whose CMV retinitis had been stabilised after intravenous treatment to receive maintenance therapy with either oral ganciclovir (3 g/day) or intravenous ganciclovir. By examination of retinal photographs, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the mean time to progression (51 days on oral ganciclovir vs 62 days on intravenous ganciclovir). Using fundoscopic evaluation the mean time to progression was 86 days for the oral group and 109 days for the intravenous group. 14% of the oral ganciclovir recipients developed haematological toxicities, compared with 23.3% of the intravenous group. Docke reported that TNF may have a key role in CMV reactivation and hypothesised that prevention of high levels of TNF should decrease CMV reactivation and disease. Research on prophylaxis Youle enrolled 302 CMV seropositive patients with advanced symptomatic HIV disease and CD4 counts below 150 (mean baseline CD4 count was 51 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 24 1 [Page 242](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/248?q1=directories) in the treated and 56 in the placebo group) in an international study of the efficacy of acyclovir in preventing CMV and other herpes virus diseases (study H14-325). Participants received oral acyclovir (800 mg four times daily) or placebo. The proportions of participants in each treatment group spending greater than 50%, 50-80% and 80-100% of their total time receiving an effective antiretroviral regimen were similar, namely 22 and 16% (placebo and acyclovir), 15 and 20%, and 63 and 64% respectively. At week 48 the study was stopped on the basis that statistically there was no evidence of a significant decrease in CMV disease occurring in the acyclovir group. At this time CMV disease had occurred in 16/123 patients in the acyclovir group and 9/123 in the placebo group. However, there was a statistically significant reduction in mortality in the high-dose acyclovir arm: 43/149 placebo recipients died (29%), the acyclovir group (18%). On an intention-to-treat analysis the overall probability of dying was 39% in the placebo group versus 23% in the acyclovir group; for those with CD4 counts below 50 the probability of dying was 56% vs 32%. Drew treated 52 HIV-positive symptomatic people with AZT 600 (mg/day) plus acyclovir (4800 mg/day in tablet form) and 41 with AZT plus placebo, to determine if high-dose ACV suppresses CMV viruria. Urine was obtained at 3 month intervals for at least 6 months. The addition of acyclovir did not suppress CMV excretion in the urine in these patients. Two placebo-controlled clinical trials studied high-dose acyclovir as prophylaxis for CMV in organ-transplant patients with drug-induced immunosuppression. Balfour gave acyclovir (800 to 3200 mg by mouth every day) or placebo to 104 patients who had received kidney transplants. After 1 year, 4/53 (7.5%) acyclovir recipients and 15/51 (29%) placebo recipients developed symptomatic CMV disease. Acyclovir was most effective as prophylaxis in CMV seronegative patients who received kidneys from CMV seropositive donors. Acyclovir had no effect on survival in this study. Meyers enrolled 151 bone-marrow transplant recipients in a CMV prophylaxis study of acyclovir (500 mg/m intravenously every 8 hours). All patients were CMV+ at entry. 19/86 (22%) of the acyclovir-recipients and of placebo recipients developed invasive CMV disease; acyclovir-recipients had better survival within the first 100 days after transplantation. In a pilot study conducted by Sha high-dose acyclovir (10 mg/kg intravenous every 8 hours) and AZT (200 mg by mouth every four hours) were administered to 10 CMV retinitis patients who completed ganciclovir induction therapy. 3 patients required AZT dose reduction due to anaemia. Preliminary results indicate that the combination of AZT and high-dose acyclovir was well tolerated; the time to first relapse approached that previously reported for ganciclovir maintenance. Metroka studied 220 HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts below 150 (mean 64) for a mean duration of 15.5 months. 5/220 receiving acyclovir (800 mg by mouth five times per day) developed invasive CMV. 9/14 patients who refused treatment and 3/5 patients who had a 50% dose reduction of acyclovir developed invasive CMV. No adverse effects were attributed to acyclovir. Jordan enrolled 17 AIDS patients with elevated CMV titres and CD4 count below 50 in a placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ganciclovir (250 mg/day, then 250 mg/week for patients weighing less than 120 Ibs; 500 mg/day, then 500 mg/week for patients weighing more than 120 Ibs). After one year follow-up 0/9 ganciclovir recipients developed CMV disease, and 4/8 placebo recipients developed CMV retinitis. A study of oral ganciclovir as primary prophylaxis for CMV retinitis was halted early by Syntex. Reports suggest that 17% of the treated group developed retinitis compared with 30% of placebo recipients. Brosgart reported that nearly 1000 people have been enrolled in CPCRA 023, a community-based multicentre trial of oral ganciclovir in people with CD4 counts below 100 and positive CMV serology. Following the termination of the Syntex study the CPCRA DSMB studied the unblinded data from this study and recommended that it continue. A phase I study of CMV immunoglobulin (CMVIg) for CMV prophylaxis at the NIAID Clinical Research Center was completed; no major side-effects or toxicities were observed. Preliminary results of a study by Aguado of ganciclovir (GCV) compared to CMVIg in non-AIDS cardiac transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy found that GCV appears to be more effective than CMVIg in reducing the incidence of CMV disease. Symptomatic CMV infection occurred in 3/12 (25%) CMVIg-subjects compared to none in the GCV-treated group; CMV infection occurred in 90% of the CMVIg group compared to 37% in the GCV group.

Relationship between CMV culture positivity and circulating CD4 count in patients with HIV infection. 6th Intl Conf AIDS, San Francisco, abstract ThB 431, 1990. histolytica Entamoeba histolytica, commonly referred to as amoebas, is a protozoal parasite of the gut which is found in about 5-10% of the population, but around 20-30% of gay men. It is transmitted by oral-faecal contact when food or water supplies are contaminated, or during oral-anal sexual contact (rimming). Symptoms and diagnosis Symptoms can vary from none to very severe. Active infection causes bloody diarrhoea, wind, nausea and pain in the lower abdomen. Infection can be diagnosed by examining a sample of stool (faeces) for the presence of the Entamoeba organisms (either in the form of dormant cysts or active individual organisms known as trophozoites). A false negative result can be obtained if you are taking antibiotics, laxatives, antacids that contain castor oil or milk of magnesia, anti-diarrhoea medicines containing bismuth or kaolin (such as Pepto-Bismol), or you have had a barium meal or enema for X-ray purposes within the last fortnight. If symptoms continue even though the test is negative, it is worth having the test repeated. Treatment It usually responds well to standard anti-parasitic therapy with metronidazole (750 mg three times a day for 10 days) followed by lodoquinol (650 mg three times a day for 20 days). * Giardia lamblia Giardia lamblia is a protozoal parasite which infects the upper small intestine causing inflammation. It is present as dormant cysts, which do not cause symptoms, in up to 10% of the population. It is transmitted when cysts from the faeces of an infected person are ingested by another person. This can happen when drinking water is contaminated, or during oral-anal sexual contact (rimming). Symptoms and diagnosis If Giardia does cause symptoms, they are usually short-lived and get better without treatment. The symptoms, known as giardiasis, are diarrhoea, wind, abdominal cramps, bloating and malabsorption. Active Giardia organisms, called trophozoites, can be detected in samples of faeces or duodenal fluid. The tests may have to be repeated up to five times if negative because it can be difficult to detect the parasite even when it is present. Treatment Giardia responds well to standard anti-protozoal drugs, and is no harder to treat in HIV-positive people than in uninfected people. The commonest drug used in metronidazole (250 mg three times a day for 10 days).

This is a gum disease frequently caused by bacteria and dental hygiene problems. HIV-positive people are more susceptible to gingivitis. HIV-related gingivitis causes redness and swelling of the gums, loss of gum tissue between the teeth, and sometimes ulcers, bleeding or pain. If untreated it may rapidly progress to HIV-related periodontitis, or inflammation around the teeth. Soft tissue may be destroyed and the underlying bone exposed, and the bone itself can be destroyed, loosening the teeth and causing severe pain. Gingivitis needs to be seen by a dentist experienced in HIV care. Treatment Gingivitis is treated by removing plaque from the teeth and clearing away any dead tissue. Infections may be treated with medical mouthwashes such as chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine; chlorhexidine contains alcohol which can cause pain. Antibiotics such as penicillin, metronidazole or clindamycin may also be required. If the condition has progressed to periodontitis, affected teeth may need be removed. Regular dental follow up is then recommended. References Winkler JR et al. Periodontal disease associated with HIV infection. Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol 73:145-150, 1992. Winkler JR et al.

It was originally thought that hairy leukoplakia only ever occurred in people with HIV but there have since been cases in other people with suppressed immune systems such as organ transplant recipients. It is not dangerous in itself, and can occur relatively early in the course of HIV infection as one of the first symptoms a person may have. However, it is a sign that the immune system is weakening and that the person may be at increased risk of other, more serious infections in the coming months. Symptoms and diagnosis It causes irregular white patches on the side of the tongue and occasionally elsewhere on the tongue or in the mouth. The patches look corrugated or folded in appearance with tiny hair-like protrusions running along the folds; these can be seen best when the tongue is stuck out and stretched to one side. The patches look quite similar to candida (thrush), except hairy leukoplakia lesions cannot be moved or dislodged. It is usually diagnosed simply by examining it. Sometimes it is mistaken for candida, but it does not respond to the 244 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS antifungal treatments used to treat candida. If needs be it can be definitively diagnosed by examining a biopsy sample under the microscope. Treatment Hairy leukoplakia in itself does not usually need to be treated, unless it is causing pain, interfering with eating or affecting your voice. If so, it usually responds to high doses (3 grams/day) of the standard anti-herpes drug acyclovir, and may clear up if you are taking similar anti-CMV drugs such as ganciclovir. It has also been reported to respond to the anti-wart treatment podophyllin. It tends to get better if you're taking AZT. Surgery to remove the lesions is also an option. Research Herbst enrolled 45 gay men with HIV-related hairy leukoplakia in a 3-month open-label study. In 14 participants who had surgical excision, pain resolved in four symptomatic patients and the leukoplakia did not recur in the areas of excision. New foci of leukoplakia, however, appeared in 10 patients after 3 months. Of the 16 participants who received acyclovir therapy, 12 had a clinical regression, although recurrences were noted in all patients after 3 months. Three patients had resolution of pain while taking acyclovir; in two the pain recurred after acyclovir was discontinued. No spontaneous remissions of the leukoplakia occurred in the 15 patients who refused therapy. Lozada-Nur treated 10 people with hairy leukoplakia with one application of topical podophyllin resin. All patients responded 4 to 5 days post treatment. Period of clinical remission ranged from 2 to 28 weeks. References Herbst JS et al.

In developed countries HBV is usually transmitted through contact with blood, semen, vaginal fluids, saliva or from mother to baby before or during birth. It occurs predominantly among gay and bisexual men, people who share drug injecting equipment and health care workers. The virus is many times more infectious than HIV. There is an effective vaccine against HBV which is recommended for anyone in these groups. The vaccine is perfectly safe for people with HIV to take, although compared with uninfected people, a higher proportion of HIV-positive people may not develop protective immunity against HBV following vaccination, and those who are successfully immunised may be more likely to lose their immunity over time. Studies of hepatitis B infection in gay men, injecting drug users and people with haemophilia have shown that hepatitis B infection does not hasten HIV disease progression or severity. [Page 245](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/251?q1=directories) The word hepatitis literally means inflammation of the liver. In people with HIV, such inflammation can also be caused by treatment drugs including sulphur-based antibiotics, ketoconazole, AZT, ddl and pentamidine, or by infections including CMV, Kaposi's sarcoma, MAI and tuberculosis. Symptoms When someone first becomes infected with HBV, they may develop jaundice (yellowing of the skin), loss of appetite, pain in the abdomen, malaise, nausea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches or fever. These symptoms can be very serious or even fatal. However, most people do not notice any symptoms on infection. Blood tests can show whether or not you have been exposed to HBV. In some people HBV continues to reproduce in the body long after infection. Some may become chronic carriers of HBV, meaning that they are infectious for life, although they may not experience any symptoms themselves. About a quarter of chronic HBV carriers eventually develop chronic liver inflammation and are at increased risk of cirrhosis or cancer of the liver. The liver damage experienced by some people with Hepatitis B is caused not by the virus itself, but by the immune systems destruction of HBV-infected cells in the liver. Because the immune responses of people with HIV are often impaired, HIV-positive people with chronic HBV infection may actually be less likely to experience liver damage than people with fully functioning immune systems. Conversely, levels of HBV in the body fluids of HIV-positive people may be higher than those seen in uninfected people because less HBV is cleared from the body by the immune system, so HIV-positive carriers of HBV may be more infectious than their HIV-negative counterparts. HIV-positive people who develop hepatitis B are at higher risk of becoming chronic carriers of HBV. Diagnosis and treatment Blood tests can detect the presence of HBV antibodies, which show that you have been exposed to the virus. If fragments of the virus itself, called hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are found in your blood for more than 6 months, you are a chronic carrier and are capable of infecting other people. Chronic hepatitis B infection is usually treated with alpha interferon in injections of 3-5 million units three times per week. Although AZT has been shown to inhibit HBV in the test-tube, studies have found no evidence that it is an effective treatment in people. Research Hadler reported that there were no significant clinical or biochemical differences in the illness of HIV-positive or HIV-negative people with acute Hepatitis B infection, although 21 out 64 HIV-positive people became chronic carriers (33%), compared with only 14 out of 239 HIV-negative people (6%). This finding has been independently confirmed by Bodsworth and Homann. Perrillo (1986) reported that histologically, liver damage in often less severe In HIV-positive people with chronic HBV infection compared with HIV-negative individuais. McDonald treated 34 people with HBV, 14 of whom were HIV-positive, with alpha interferon 2a. No HIV-positive people responded to treatment, compared with 33% of HIV-negative people. Hoofnagle reported a 25% response to therapy among HIV-positive people treated with alpha interferon 2b. Perrillo (1990) compared prednisone followed by alpha interferon 2b versus no treatment in a group of people with HBV of whom 3 were also HIV-positive. 2 of the 3 responded, but experienced increases in transaminase levels after withdrawal of prednisone. Marcellin treated 15 HIV-positive people with chronic hepatitis B with AZT (600 - 1200 mg/day) for a mean of 14 weeks. No change in HBV DNA levels was observed. References Bodsworth NJ et al.

SHerpes simplex virus Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a member of the herpes virus family which also includes Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Herpes simplex is quite common in the population. Once you are infected the virus stays in skin and nerve cells for life. Most of the time it is dormant and causes no symptoms, but from time to time it can flare up. This tends to happen when the immune system is weakened, in situations of stress (e.g. bereavement) or on exposure to strong ultraviolet light, even in people without HIV. Such attacks also occur more frequently in children and in old people, both groups that have less efficient immune systems than adults. There is some evidence that herpes viruses can act as a co-factor in AIDS, activating HIV and making it easier for HIV to infect certain cells. Symptoms There are two main types of HSV. HSV-1, or oral herpes, is the virus which causes cold sores (herpes labialis) - tingling or painful spots on the edge of the lip where it meets the skin of the face. These can occasionally develop on the nostrils, on the gums or on the roof of the mouth. HSV-2, or genital herpes, is the virus which causes very painful genital or anal ulcers, sometimes accompanied with fever, headache, muscle ache and malaise. Herpes lesions start as small bumps that rapidly develop into small inflamed fluid-filled blisters (or vesicles). These burst and crust over, taking a couple of weeks to heal. The virus can be passed from person-to-person by contact between these lesions and mucous membranes. A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 245 [Page 246](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/252?q1=directories) In people with HIV, herpes attacks tend to be more frequent, more severe and longer lasting. Sometimes the lesions can become infected with other bacteria or fungi. As well as causing large oral and anogenital lesions, herpes can affect the throat, colon and, rarely, other organs including the liver, eye and lung. Herpes encephalitis is inflammation of the brain, causing headache, nausea, mental changes, loss of coordination and seizures; this is rare in people with HIV, perhaps because their immune systems ability to mount an inflammatory response may be impaired. An HIV-positive person who has herpes attacks of the skin and/or mucous membranes which last for 4 weeks or longer, or herpes in the throat of any duration, is diagnosed as having AIDS. Diagnosis HSV is diagnosed by growing (culturing) the virus from a swab taken from a lesion, or by using a fluorescent screening test to detect the virus. Herpes in the oesophagus (throat) or colon may need to be examined using fibre-optic instruments. Herpes encephalitis can only be definitively diagnosed by brain biopsy, since HSV cannot be cultured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Treatment and prophylaxis Herpes infections are treated with acyclovir (also known by its tradename Zovirax). Although this is available in chemists as a cream for preventing cold sores, it is usually used in tablet form (200-800 mg fives times a day for 5 - 10 days) to treat serious attacks or genital or anal ulcers. It also comes as an intravenous drip (5-10 mg/kg every 8 hours) for severe attacks or those involving the eye. Acyclovir has very few side-effects. Valaciclovir is an acyclovir pro-drug: it breaks down into acyclovir in the body, enabling 3-4 times higher blood levels of acyclovir to be reached. Previously such high levels, which are required to treat serious herpes infections, could only be achieved through intravenous injections of acyclovir. Occasionally herpes viruses become resistant to acyclovir. This may be more likely if someone has been on acyclovir prophylaxis for a long time. Various other drugs are being studied as alternatives to acyclovir in this eventuality, including foscarnet, trifluridine, vidarabine, valaciclovir and sorivudine. Salt baths are good for relieving the pain of genital herpes lesions. Some herpes infections are so common and troublesome that some doctors recommend that anyone with symptomatic HIV infection should take a low dose of acyclovir permanently as a preventive measure (primary prophylaxis). Acyclovir cannot eliminate latent HSV virus in nerve cells, so herpes attacks may recur after an attack has been treated. It may be possible to delay or prevent some recurrences by taking acyclovir tablets as maintenance therapy (secondary prophylaxis); breakthrough attacks may be due to the development of acyclovir-resistant strains of HSV. If you have been taking long-term maintenance therapy it is unwise to stop it abruptly, as this can result in a serious herpes outbreak. 246 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS Research Oral acyclovir is approved for the treatment of HSV-related syndromes and reduces the severity and duration of HSV symptoms. Acyclovir is also effective as primary and secondary prophylaxis against herpes simplex. Heng showed that in vitro co-infection with HSV-1 allows HIV-1 to infect cells not normally permissive to HIV-1 infection (in this case, keratinocytes which do not express the CD4 receptor). The authors also noted unique morphological and replicative characteristics of the virions in the co-infected cells which suggested the presence of an HSV-1/HIV-1 hybrid virus. These data may support the concept of suppressive treatment for herpes simplex in HIV-1 infected people. However, the long-term use of suppressant acyclovir in people with HIV has been associated with the development of thymidine-kinase deficient, acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex infections. Erlich treated 4 AIDS acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 disease with foscarnet (60 mg/kg intravenous every 8 hours) for 12 to 50 days. Dramatic clinical improvement, marked clearing of lesions, and eradication of HSV from mucous membranes were noted. Tan treated 6 patients with acyclovir-resistant HSV with foscarnet (40 mg/kg intravenous every eight hours for 14 days, followed by 40 mg/kg/day maintenance). Significant or complete healing of lesions occurred in all patients by the end of day 14. Foscarnet maintenance suppressed the recurrence of lesions for up to 10 weeks. Recurrent lesions were successfully treated with re-induction of foscarnet. No significant renal or neurological toxicities were seen. One patient developed persistent penile ulcerations. Safrin compared foscarnet (40 mg/kg HSV received foscarnet and 6 received vidarabine. The study was halted due to excessive toxicity and inferior efficacy of vidarabine. No patient healed on vidarabine. Lesions reduced in size and healed more rapidly in foscarnet recipients. Pain resolution and cessation of viral shedding also occurred more quickly in foscarnet recipients. 3/6 vidarabine patients had neurotoxicity (confusion, myoclonus) that required discontinuation of treatment; no foscarnet patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity. All healed patients had a recurrence of acyclovir-resistant HSV (median time to relapse 42.5 days after discontinuation of foscarnet). Pottage identified 34 clinical isolates of acyclovir-resistant HSV from 25 people, 20 of whom had AIDS. Antiviral drugs included trifluridine (TFT), FIAC, FIAU, FMAU, vitro. Foscarnet, vidarabine and trifluridine were the most consistently active agents. The IC5o of trifluridine for 27 of 34 isolates was less than 1.0 g/ml. Kessler enrolled 26 people with AIDS in an open-label study (ACTG 172) of topical trifluridine (TFT) for ACV-resistant chronic mucocutaneous HSV. Data reported on 9 participants showed that 7/9 responded to treatment. Lesions completely healed in 5/7 responders (mean duration to healing 32 days) and 2/7 had a partial response. No toxicities were reported. Weaver treated two AIDS patients with acyclovir-resistant HSV with topical trifluridine (TFT) solution. TFT (less than 110 mg total dose per treatment) was applied three times daily; all lesions healed completed within 11 to 34 days. References Chatis PA et al.

SHistoplasmosis Histoplasmosis is disease caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, which is common in south-central U.S. and South America but very rare in the UK. It is found in soil contaminated by bird droppings or other organic material. It is caught by breathing in the spores which then sprout into a yeast form; it is not transmitted from person-to-person. In people with damaged immune systems the yeast is able to grow in the bloodstream and spread (disseminate) to the lungs and skin, and sometimes elsewhere in the body. Over 90% of people with AIDS diagnosed with histoplasmosis have CD4 cell counts below 100. Symptoms and diagnosis Histoplasmosis can cause fever, weight loss, skin lesions, breathing problems, and enlargement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. It commonly affects the bone marrow causing shortages of red blood cells (anaemia), some white blood cells (leukopenia) and platelets (thrombocytopenia); the skin and the central nervous system. Less frequently it infects the heart or the eye. It is diagnosed by detecting the fungus by growing (culturing) it from bone marrow samples or using the H.capsulatum variety capsulatum polysaccharide antigen detection test on a sample of urine or blood serum. Treatment and prophylaxis Itraconazole is an effective treatment for AIDS-related histoplasmosis. In severe cases, amphotericin B (Fungizone) may be used. It has unpleasant side-effects such as fevers, chills, kidney damage and bone marrow suppression. There is no standard prophylaxis against histoplasmosis although long-term maintenance therapy with itraconazole appears to be effective at preventing relapses. Although not as effective as itraconazole, fluconazole has also shown some efficacy against histoplasmosis. Research Amphotericin B and itraconazole are effective in the treatment of histoplasmosis. Long-term maintenance therapy is required to prevent relapse of disseminated histoplasmosis following initial induction treatment in people with AIDS. Due to the absorption variability of itraconazole it is recommended that blood levels be monitored 2-4 hours after dosing during the second week of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. Ideally, itraconazole blood levels of 2 g/ml should be achieved for induction and 1 g/ml for maintenance. Wheat (1992) enrolled 61 patients in ACTG 120, a study of itraconazole (300 mg by mouth twice a day for 3 days followed by 200 mg by mouth twice a day for 12 weeks) as treatment for acute histoplasmosis. 50/59 (85%) patients responded to treatment (clearance of fungaemia) and were continued on itraconazole maintenance therapy (200 to 400 mg/day) for at least one year. Of the 9 non-responders, 6 failed treatment, 2 experienced toxicity and 1 was lost to follow-up. Wheat (1994) conducted an open-label study (ACTG 174) of fluconazole (1600 mg on the first day followed by 800 mg/day for 12 weeks, then 400 mg/day maintenance therapy) for histoplasmosis. 37/50 participants responded +o induction therapy. 1 2/37 participants who entered maintenance therapy failed. The study was closed by the interim monitoring team when they found a difference in failure rate of people receiving itraconazole in ACTG 120 (5%) compared with fluconazole-treated people in ACTG 174 (33%). McKinsey concluded that long-term, intermittent maintenance therapy with amphotericin B (50-80 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) was effective and well tolerated. 63% of patients developed catheter-related complications. Wheat (1993) enrolled 42 patients with proven disseminated histoplasmosis in ACTG 084, a study of itraconazole (200 mg by mouth twice daily) for maintenance treatment. No relapse occurred in 30/32 patients followed for longer than 52 weeks (mean follow-up of 76 weeks); 2/32 withdrew from study, one from toxicity. Norris found fluconazole (100-400 mg) to be moderately effective and a reasonable choice in patients who were given induction therapy with amphotericin B and who could not take itraconazole because of drug interactions, malabsorption or side effects. Nightingale routinely treated HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts below 68 with fluconazole 100 mg/day to prevent disseminated fungal infections. 329 patients who received fluconazole prophylaxis were compared to an historical control of 337 patients with CD4 counts below 68 who did not receive prophylaxis. Development of histoplasmosis was equivalent in the two groups. One of 329 patients in the fluconazole group and 16/337 in the historical control no-treatment group developed cryptococcosis.

It is thought to be due to the direct effects of HIV upon the central nervous system (CNS - the brain and spinal cord). It is clear that the CNS may be exposed to HIV early in the course of infection. While there may be some mild abnormalities in the cerebrospinal fluid - such as increased levels of white blood cells, protein or antibodies, as well as the presence of HIV itself - this does not usually result in any problems or symptoms. A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 247 [Page 248](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/254?q1=directories) However, around the time of seroconversion, some people with HIV develop various short-lived neurological problems such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), meningitis (inflammation of the meninges, the membranes which line the brain) or neuropathy (damage to the nerves). These syndromes are thought to be due either to HIV itself infecting cells, or to the immune system's response to HIV infection. They are usually short-lived and get better on their own. Later in the course of infection people with HIV may develop the more serious HIV encephalopathy. This hardly ever occurs except when a person has had major opportunistic infections and when the CD4 count has fallen below 50. Very rarely it may occur in people with less severe immune damage. HIV encephalopathy appears to be becoming less common. It has been suggested that this may be owing to the use of AZT. Alternatively it may be simply because the patterns of illness have changed during the years of the epidemic. HIV-related neurological problems are common in children with AIDS, and untreated can lead to major developmental delays and problems in understanding, coordination and movement. It is important to remember that neurological problems in people with HIV can have a variety of causes. Apart from the ways in which HIV itself can directly affect the nervous system, infections and tumours can occur in the nervous system when the immune system is damaged by HIV. These include Cryptococcus, CMV, toxoplasmosis. People with HIV can also develop a number of other neurological disorders, including brain damage due to lack of oxygen resulting from lung infections, liver dysfunction or clotting within the veins. Strokes may also complicate the course of AIDS. Likewise, many treatments may cause mental disturbances or lack of alertness. People with AIDS may be particularly sensitive to the side-effects of antipsychotic drugs and others which are active within the central nervous system. The following common treatment drugs can sometimes cause various neuropsychiatric effects (such as depression, irritability, delirium, confusion, hallucinations encephalopathy begins with slight changes in behaviour, intellect and coordination. Friends and family notice forgetfulness, 'change in personality' and symptoms which are normally characteristic of depression, such as loss of appetite and 'get-up-and-go'. Tasks that require concentration or complex thought become difficult. These symptoms are interspersed with sharp mood swings, mania, schizophrenia or suicidal impulses. Motor skills gradually deteriorate - hands become clumsy, movement is slow and unsteady, eye movements become jerky. Post-mortem examinations have shown that HIV encephalopathy involves the loss of the outer coating 248 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS (myelin) from nerve cells and the accumulation of various cells in the brain matter. HIV itself can be detected in the brain in various blood cells (macrophages and monocytes), brain cells (microglia, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) and the cell walls of capillaries. Diagnosis In the early stages of HIV encephalopathy, standard neuropsychological tests can detect subtle changes in memory, concentration and information-processing. In the later stages, HIV encephalopathy can be diagnosed from the symptoms. Abnormalities in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF - the clear watery fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) may include an excess of white blood cells, protein and immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the presence of HIV and the HIV protein p24. Brain scans using computerised axial tomography (CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also reveal distinctive signs. Treatment HIV-related damage is initially reversible. The temporary brain problems which can occur at the time of seroconversion usually get better on their own. However, encephalopathy can cause irreversible damage and lasting disability, usually in advanced disease. AZT can improve and possibly prevent HIV encephalopathy. The degree of improvement from AZT depends on how much damage has been done and so people with very advanced central nervous system disease may not benefit. It is not yet clear how long these benefits will last. In people who take AZT from a relatively early stage of HIV infection, the risk of developing encephalopathy is also decreased. ddl has also been reported to improve encephalopathy, but this has not been definitively proven. Some clinicians have noted that people who switch from AZT to ddl sometimes suffer a resurgence of neurological problems which get better again if the AZT is restarted. Some theories suggest that the HIV envelope protein gpl 20 may have toxic effects in the brain, so drugs which block the binding of gpl 20 to the CD4 molecule on human cells are being studied. One such drug is Peptide T which was reported in a preliminary study to improve cognitive problems. The drug is administered by spraying it up the nose. Another approach is looking at drugs like nimodipine that change the level of calcium in the brain; calcium levels are thought to be disrupted by gpl 20. Another theory is that brain problems are caused by excessive levels of the cytokine tumour necosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Drugs that reduce the levels of TNF-alpha, such as oxpentifylline, are also being tested. It is also possible to treat some of the symptoms of HIV encephalopathy. People who have slowed reactions may benefit from psychostimulants such as methylphenidate hydrochloride (tradename Ritalin). People who are agitated or manic can be treated with lithium or neuroleptics, starting with low doses. Research Price enrolled 40 patients with AIDS dementia in a placebo-controlled study of AZT (1,000 or 2,000 mg/day). Final analysis showed neuropsychiatric function improved in those patients receiving AZT as compared to placebo, with a suggestion of increased efficacy with high dose AZT (2,000 versus 1,000 mg every day). [Page 249](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/255?q1=directories) Brouwers treated 21 symptomatic children aged from 14 months to 12 years with intravenous AZT (0.5, 0.9, 1.4 or 1.8 mg/kg/hour). 13 (62%) had evidence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities. The only evidence of toxicity was bone marrow suppression. Transfusion was required in 14 patients because of low levels of haemoglobin. Dose-limiting neutropenia occurred in most patients who received doses of 1.4 mg/kg/hour or more. Improvements in neurodevelopmental abnormalities occurred in all 13 children who had presented with encephalopathy before treatment. Serial measurements of IQ before therapy and after three and six months of continuous therapy with AZT showed that IQ scores rose in these 13 patients and in 5 other children who had no detectable evidence of encephalopathy before treatment. Most patients also had increased appetite and weight, decreased lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, decreased immunoglobulin levels, and increased numbers of CD4 cells. In some patients the improvement in the features of encephalopathy occurred despite the absence of immunologic improvement. Sidtis randomised 40 subjects with mild to moderate AIDS dementia complex to one of three treatment arms: 400 mg of AZT five times daily, 200 mg of AZT five times daily, or placebo five times daily. After week 16, patients initially randomized to the placebo group were rerandomized to one of the two AZT treatment arms. For the initial 16-week period, average z scores based on the neuropsychological test battery revealed a significant improvement in the combined treatment groups compared to the placebo group; however, when the two treatment groups were compared separately to the placebo group, only the group receiving the higher AZT dose exhibited significant improvement. After rerandomization of the placebo patients to one of the two treatment arms at week 16, this group also showed significant improvement in the average neuropsychological z score by week 32. Tozzi conducted an open study of three doses of AZT (1000 mg/day, 750 mg/day or 500 mg/day) in 30 people with AIDS dementia complex. Response to trreatment was sometimes transient and was not associated with the dose of AZT. Yarchoan reported on 5 patients with HIV-related neuropsychiatric impairment who received ddl in a dose-ranging phase I study; all patients experienced significant improvement. McGrail conducted an open Phase I trial of escalating intravenous Peptide T (0.06-3.2mg/kg/day) in 15 AIDS and ARC patients. CSF samples were taken for measures of neuronal survival and VIP. It has previously been reported that neuropsychologic change across time correlated significantly with protection against gpl 20 induced neurotoxicity from patient CSF in hippocampal cell culture assay. Peptide T reversibility of CSF induced neuronal killing at baseline showed a trend to correlation with neuropsychologic change on drug. CSF VIP showed a direct and significant correlation with neuronal survival on Peptide T and a trend toward a direct correlation between CSF VIP and Peptide T reversibility of CSF neuronal killing at baseline. A phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial of peptide T (2 mg three times a day by nasal spray) in HIV+ individuals with cognitive impairment is under way at USC. 21 patients are enrolled. 1 patient dropped out due to neuropsychological complications. A phase II double blind, placebo controlled cross-over trial of peptide T (0.4 mg by nasal spray three times a day) for HIV+ intravenous drug users exhibiting signs of ADC or cognitive impairment is under way at Yale; Kosten reported that five patients have completed the nine week treatment. All patients showed some improvement in neuro-cognitive function. No toxicities were reported. Wolters evaluated the effects of ddl on 64 children with symptomatic HIV infection. All patients received ddl for at least 6 months. 42/64 patients received ddl for 12 months. Age-appropriate general intelligence tests were administered to children prior to treatment and after 6 and 12 months of ddl. Overall there was no change in IQ scores associated with ddl. Individually, over the first 6 months of ddl treatment 21% of the children showed significant improvement in IQ (10% change and 8 points), 9% declined, and 70% remained stable. There was little further change in IQ scores after the second 6 months of treatment. The investigators suggest a correlation between plasma ddl concentrations and improved IQ scores.

SHodgkin's disease Hodgkin's disease is a type of lymphoma - a tumour of lymph nodes - named after Thomas Hodgkin, a pathologist who first described in the early 19th century. Cells that normally live in lymph nodes, particularly lymphocytes, start growing out of control and cause the node to swell up. Depending on the type of lymphoma, sooner or later these cells will spread to other parts of the A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 249 [Page 250](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/256?q1=directories) body causing more damage. The other main kind of lymphoma is Non Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unclear whether people with HIV are at increased risk of Hodgkin's disease. One study suggested that Hodgkin's disease was more common than usual in a group of HIV-positive gay men, but other researchers have not observed this. Symptoms and diagnosis Along with swollen glands, which can get very large, Hodgkin's disease causes a characteristic rising-and-falling fever known as Pel-Ebstein fever, anaemia and weakness. In people with HIV the disease is particularly likely to spread beyond the lymph nodes, affecting the bone marrow and other parts of the body. This more severe form is known as stage III or IV Hodgkin's disease. Diagnosis is made primarily by taking a sample of a lymph-node and studying it under the microscope. Occasionally samples of bone marrow or other soft tissue may be biopsied. The presence of a characteristic cell called the Reed-Sternberg cell must be confirmed to establish the diagnosis. Treatment Early (stage I and II) Hodgkin's disease is most frequently treated with radiation therapy, More advanced, stage III and IV Hodgkin's disease is treated with combination chemotherapy, using either MOPP (Nitrogen mustard dexamethasone). People with HIV find these treatments harder to tolerate than uninfected people; treatment may be better tolerated when simultaneous treatment with the growth factors GM-CSF and G-CSF is given. People who have a higher CD4 count at diagnosis, whose Hodgkin's disease is restricted to the lymph nodes and who have not had previous opportunistic infections have the best prognosis. Research Hessol observed an excess number of cases of Hodgkins disease in a cohort of HIV-infected gay men and suggested that it may be an HIV-related malignancy. However, other investigators have not confirmed an excess number of cases. References Ames ED et al. Hodgkin's disease and AIDS: Twenty-three new cases and a review of the literature.

It has since been found to be relatively common in the population as a whole, although 250 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS people with HIV do appear to be particularly likely to be infected. One study found HHV-6 in all the body tissues that were studied from 9 randomly selected people with HIV at autopsy. HHV-6 infects T-lymphocytes. The only disease that has been conclusively linked to HHV-6 is exanthem subitum, a feverish illness of children. In immunosuppressed people it is a possible cause of pneumonitis. Some researchers have suggested that HHV-6 could contribute to the loss of CD4 cells in people with HIV, since HHV-6 can activate HIV in latently infected cells and stimulates the relase of cytokines that in turn also activate HIV. It also stimulates CD8 T-cells and natural killer cells to express the CD4 receptor, rendering them vulnerable to infection by HIV. Some researchers have suggested that infection with both HIV and HHV-6 make make retinal cells in the eye particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections such as CMV. Research Knox detected HHV-6 in all lung, lymph node, spleen, liver and kidney tissues obtained at necropsy from an unselected series of 9 people with AIDS. This infection rate was significantly higher than that for CMV. In one person lung infection was extensive enough to account for fatal pneumonitis. References Knox KK et al.

Most people remember having had warts at different times in their lives; these often disappear after a few weeks or months, because the immune system can fight them off. Some types of HPV have special characteristics. These types can be spread sexually and so cause genital warts (known as condylomata acuminata) in women at the cervix (the 'neck of the womb' at the top of the vagina), on the penis in men and round and inside the anus in both sexes. If genital warts are successfully treated the HPV becomes inactive, but remains in the body. In HIV-positive people the HPV is more likely to become reactivated. HPV can change the skin cells they infect to make them cancerous. Cell changes which indicate that cancer may develop are called dysplasia; this is sometimes called 'pre-cancer'. Sometimes doctors talk about cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). This means that there is a cancerous growth within the cells lining the cervix. If untreated, these growths lead to invasive cervical cancer which can be a life-threatening condition. It has become clear that the immune damage caused by HIV can increase the risk of women developing cervical cancer and of gay men developing anal cancer. Symptoms Genital warts are flattish, 'cauliflower-like' protuberances which can be small and single or large and in clumps. Other HPV-related abnormalities, such as cancerous [Page 251](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/257?q1=directories) changes in the cells of the cervix or rectum, may not cause any symptoms until the condition is advanced, so regular screening is advisable. Diagnosis Genital warts can be diagnosed by examination of the vagina, vulva, cervix, perianal region, anal canal and penis, but the HPV infection can be present even if the warts are not. PAP (short for Papanicolaou) smears are designed to detect dysplasia early, before cancer develops. They involve taking a small scraping of cells from the cervix or anus. When these cells are examined under a microscope it is possible to see if there are any changes in the cells which suggest that cancer could develop in the future. HIV-positive women are recommended to have PAP smears when they are first diagnosed with HIV, 6 months later, and then at least once a year. There is no equivalent screening service for gay men, although they are also clearly at increased risk of anal dysplasia. It has been recommended that gay men with anal warts attend GU clinics for regular clinical assessment. Pre-cancerous changes in cervical cells can also be observed using a more precise procedure called colposcopy. This is an examination of the cervix using a magnifying instrument, and is often accompanied by a biopsy, when a small piece of tissue is snipped away from the cervix for examination. The equivalent procedure for testing for anal dysplasia is called anoscopy. A study presented at the 10th International Conference on AIDS reported that PAP smears were as effective as colposcopy in detecting cervical abnormalities that merited treatment. Treatment and prophylaxis Genital warts can be treated by painting chemicals such as trichloroacetic acid, podophyllin resin or 5-Flouracil (5-FU) onto them. They are sometimes treated by injecting them with alpha interferon. Other treatment options include freezing them with liquid nitrogen or burning them off with a laser. Early, 'in situ' cancer can be treated similarly or by removal of the affected part of the cervix. More serious cancer is treated with surgery. If the cancer has spread round the body, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are sometimes used. There is no drug to prevent warts or HPV-related abnormalities; the best prophylaxis is careful monitoring to ensure that any problems are detected early and treated as soon as possible. Research Klein found that HIV-positive women have a higher rate of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) on PAP smear than HIV-negative women. SIL was detected on HIV-infected women with CD4 counts below 500 and with evidence of HPV infection may be at higher risk for developing neoplastic changes in the cervix. Palefsky reviewed the literature on anal HPV and anal cancer in HIV infection. Studies in HIV-positive gay men suggest that anal HPV infection is extremely common, and that as the CD4 count declines the prevalence of high level infection increases. The prevalance of anal intraepithelial neoplosia also increases as the CD4 cell count declines, suggesting either a direct effect of immune suppression or an association with active viral replication. Almost nothing is known about anal cancer precursors and anal HPV infection in women. Several studies have documented an association between cervical HPV infection, cervical disease and HPV infection, suggesting that these women may also be at increased risk of anal HPV infection and disease. Screening for AIN is recommended for HIV-negative men with a history of receptive anal intercourse, HIV-positive men with a CD4 cell count below 500, HIV-positive or HIV-negative women with a high-grade CIN, and HIV-positive women with a CD4 count below 500. Treatment for high-grade AIN usually consists of electrocautery or excisional biopsy. Melbye reported that the risk of anal cancer was greatly increased among gay and heterosexual people with HIV compared with the general population, especially for young gay men. Williams reported that among 144 women, the prevalence of HPV infection was 56% of anal swabs and 13% of cervical swabs in HIV-negative high-risk women, and 77% of anal swabs and 57% of cervical swabs in HIV-positive women. 14% of women, most of whom were HIV-positive. had anal cytologic abnormalities and 1 % had cervical abnormalities. The grade of anal disease was generally less severe than that of cervical disease, and the proportion of women with anal HPV infection who had anal disease was lower than the proportion with cervical HPV infection who had cervical disease, suggesting that anal HPV infection may be less aggressive in causing disease than cervical infection.

It is most commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, and is rare in the UK. It is probably transmitted by oral-faecal contact from person-to-person; unlike Cryptosporidium, it does not appear to be transmitted from animal-to-human. It can infect the intestines of HIV-positive people, causing the illness known as isosporiasis (sometimes called coccidiosis). Symptoms and diagnosis Isosporiasis causes symptoms very similar to those of cryptosporidiosis - watery diarrhoea, cramping pains in the abdomen and weight loss. It is diagnosed by testing a sample of stool (faeces) for the presence of the parasite. Treatment Co-trimoxazole (one double-strength tablet 4 times a day for 10 days, then twice a day for 3 weeks) is effective against isosporiasis; the diarrhoea usually improves within a couple of days of starting treatment. For people who cannot tolerate co-trimoxazole, pyrimethamine plus leucovorin, pyrimethamine plus sulphadoxine, or furazolidone Maintenance (secondary prophylaxis) with co-trimoxazole, pyrimethamine alone, pyrimethamine plus sulphadoxine or metronidazole is necessary to try to prevent recurrence. Key research Pape successfully treated 32 patients with co-trimoxazole (160 mg/800 mg by mouth four times daily for 10 days). 22 patients were randomized to receive maintenance therapy of either co-trimoxazole (160 mg/800 mg three times a week) or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (500 mg/25 mg weekly). One patient receiving co-trimoxazole relapsed three weeks after initiation of maintenance. All others remained asymptomatic. 5/10 on placebo relapsed 1.5 months after initial treatment. Weiss successfully treated two AIDS patients, unable to tolerate sulphonamides, for isosporiasis with pyrimethamine (50-75 mg by mouth every day) and leucovorin (10 mg by mouth every day); recurrence was prevented by maintenance treatment with pyrimethamine (25 mg by mouth every day) and leucovorin (5 mg by mouth every day). Kayembe treated 8 AIDS patients with abdominal pains and Isospora belli diarrhoea with 200 mg diclazuril for 7 days. The abdominal pains and cramps disappeared in all 8 patients. All patients were negative for I. belli at the first check up. In 1 patient severe diarrhoea persisted. References DeHovitz JA et al. Clinical manifestations of Isospora belli patients with AIDS.

Before the AIDS epidemic it was a rare condition. It has been observed in four different forms. Classic KS causes multiple skin lesions on the lower limbs. It is mainly seen in elderly men in 252 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS Mediterranean or Eastern European regions. Endemic KS is found in children and young men in equatorial Africa. It is more virulent than the classic form. Acquired KS occurs in people treated with immunosuppressive drugs, especially those who have received organ transplants. It goes away when the drugs are stopped. Epidemic KS is the form associated with HIV infection. It tends to follow a more variable but potentially more aggressive course than other forms of KS. Epidemic KS is still the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in people with HIV. In HIV-positive people KS can occur while the immune system is still relatively intact, and many people with KS remain free of other symptoms for many months or years. As long as it is confined to the skin KS is not fatal, and it is unlikely to be serious as long as the CD4 count is above 250. But for historical reasons, KS is in itself diagnostic of AIDS. KS predominantly affects gay men with HIV. It has always been rare among HIV-positive drug users and people with haemophilia. If a woman with HIV develops KS it seems usually the case that she became infected with HIV through unsafe sex with a bisexual man. There are also a very small number of gay men in the USA who have KS but do not have HIV infection or AIDS. KS is becoming less common in people with relatively early HIV infection. However, it is being diagnosed more frequently in people who have already been diagnosed with AIDS and who have relatively advanced immunosuppression. KS can occur anywhere in the body, but is most commonly found on the skin, or in the lymph nodes, lungs or intestines, causing different problems. Symptoms On the skin KS causes brownish-red to purplish-black lesions which do not go white when they are pressed (as bruises do). They hurt in the sun, or can get cut whilst shaving. They may be painful on the soles of the feet. Common sites are the tip of the nose, feet, lower leg, penis, trunk, roof of the mouth and gums. In the lymph nodes blocked fluid drainage may cause swelling, especially in the feet, lower legs or genitals. Occasionally swelling occurs around the eyes. Rarely, in the spleen, KS can cause high fevers and anaemia, known as Castleman's syndrome. In the lungs, KS can lead to recurrent chest infections, or accumulation of fluid on the lung (pleural effusion). There may be blood in spit, cough and breathlessness. In the intestines KS is usually harmless, but can sometimes cause difficulty in swallowing, abdominal pain, and occasionally bleeding. Cause The cause of KS is not known, but there are several different theories. One leading hypothesis suggests that KS develops because the immune system is overactivated. Some research has found that KS cells can originally develop as a result of abnormalities in levels of cytokines, chemical messengers in the body. These early KS cells do not appear to be genuinely cancerous at all. Once established, KS cells themselves secrete cytokines that promote their own growth and which stimulate other cells also to release cytokines [Page 253](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/259?q1=directories) that promote KS cell growth. Eventually, in some cases but not all the cells become cancerous. One of the overactive substances that may cause the develoment of KS lesions is called oncostatin M. This is a growth factor that is secreted by activated T-lymphocytes; thus, infections such as HIV or STDs that activate lymphocytes may lead to an increase in levels of oncostatin M. Oncostatin M is only one of a number of angiogenic growth factors - factors that stimulate the development of blood vessels. KS cells also seem to produce high levels of other angiogenic factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). The presence of HIV itself may play a role. Studies have shown that the HIV tat gene seems to cause the development of KS-like lesions in mice, and the Tat protein produced by this gene stimulates the growth of human KS cells in the test-tube. Antibodies against Tat appeared to block the development of KS cells in the test-tube. Another plausible theory is that KS is caused by an unidentified sexually transmitted agent. A number of studies have examined the social and demographic characteristics of HIV-positive gay men with KS, compared with men who do not develop KS, but no consistent pattern has emerged. One study found evidence that gay men who develop KS may have been more likely to have had sex in New York, Los Angeles or San Francisco, indicating that any sexually transmitted agent may have been particularly prevalent there. Other studies have suggested that men with KS were much more likely to have practised rimming (oral-anal sex) than men without KS, implying that this could be the main route of transmission for any causative agent; however, other researchers have been unable to find any link with rimming. Moreover, there is no evidence that antibiotics or antivirals, which might be assumed to inhibit any causative agent, are helpful for KS. Another suggested cause is a known infection, such as human papilloma virus (HPV). One group of researchers has reported that the sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test showed that DNA resembling the DNA of HPV-16 was present in cells taken from KS lesions and in KS cells grown in the laboratory. HPV is usually transmitted by genital-to-genital sexual contact, not by oral-anal sex. Early theories that KS might be caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) have now been almost universally discounted. There have also been suggestions that KS might be linked to the recreational drug poppers (nitrite inhalants). KS is an AIDS-defining symptom largely restricted to gay and bisexual men, the most frequent users of poppers. KS is very rare outside this risk group - although a small number of cases have been reported in the female partners of bisexual men. It has been noted by a number of studies that gay and bisexual men who have used poppers are much more likely to have developed KS as an AIDS-defining illness than non-users. This relationship was dose-dependent. However, a number of other studies have shown no clear relationship. Cases of KS have been reported in HIV-negative gay and bisexual men who were heavy users of poppers. However, more than a dozen HIV-negative cases have also been reported in gay and bisexual men who never used poppers. To explain why poppers may play a role in the development of KS, two particular explanations have been put forward. Poppers particularly deplete natural killer cells, the immune system cells which play a role in controlling the development of cancers. Some researchers also believe that poppers may react with antibiotics to form carcinogenic substances in the body, which might explain why some gay and bisexual men have developed KS in the absence of HIV infection. Another theory suggests that poppers might cause KS through their dilatory action on blood vessels. Diagnosis The best way to diagnose KS is by biopsy - taking a 4-6 mm sample of a skin lesion and examining it under the microscope. Lesions in the lung can be inspected using a flexible fibre-optic instrument called a bronchoscope, but biopsy samples are generally not taken because of the risk of causing internal bleeding. Chest X-rays and scans can also reveal the presence of lung tumours. KS in the intestines can be viewed with a fibre-optic endoscope, but biopsy samples often test negative because the lesions themselves are under the surface, rather than on it. No one should attempt to self-diagnose KS: lots of things can look and feel like KS (e.g. bruises, bites, infections). Treatment KS on the skin is not, in itself, a life-threatening condition and is therefore not always automatically treated. There is no evidence that the treatment of one or two small skin lesions makes any difference to life-expectancy. This uncertainty has to be weighed against the toxic effects of chemotherapy, which may also be immunosuppressive. Decisions to treat because of the site and perhaps the disfiguring nature of skin lesions should be at the initiative of the person with KS. Consequently it is important to seek out the latest information and be well informed about the balance of medical opinion. Unless the KS is very obvious, most people won't see it or recognise it if they do see it. If, however it is obvious there are techniques of cosmetic camouflage for disguising KS as ordinary skin. A number of self-help organisations and AIDS centres offer help with cosmetic camouflage However, KS in internal organs, which tends to occur much later in HIV disease when the immune system is more severely impaired, is a life-threatening condition which does need treatment. There is no standard treatment for KS. There are two different types: topical or local, which means just one part of the body is being treated, and systemic, when the whole body is being treated. Topical treatments that have shown to be effective include freezing KS lesions with liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy), surgical removal of lesions or injecting KS lesions with chemotherapy drugs such as vinblastine or alpha interferon. Too little chemotherapy is given to affect the rest of the body. The lesions swell up, which is painful, and then resolve, leaving a small mark. Radiation therapy (RT) can be used on KS lesions in the mouth or throat, painful skin lesions or lesions that are causing blockages in lymph glands of the face, arms or legs. Although this type of treatment is restricted to small parts of the body, it can have side-effects such as inflammation of mucous membranes (mucositis) when used in the mouth, which can sometimes be severe or even A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 253 [Page 254](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/260?q1=directories) life-threatening. It can also cause reddening and loss of hair in the area being given radiation treatment. Systemic therapy may be required if many skin lesions are appearing very quickly (too many appearing too fast for topical treatment) or if internal KS is causing problems. The two main types of systemic therapy which have been shown to be effective are recombinant human alpha interferon and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Alpha interferon is a cytokine which has immune system boosting effects, antiretroviral effects and, possibly, direct effects against tumours, including possible antiangiogenic effects. It has to be given by injections into the skin, which is fairly easy for most people to learn to do themselves. It is approved for treating KS in certain people with CD4 counts above 200. Alpha interferon tends to be more effective in people whose immune systems are not severely damaged, for example those with CD4 counts above 200 and no history of opportunistic infections or symptoms such as fever, weight loss or night sweats. In this group, it has been shown to improve KS in about 30-50 percent of people taking it, although this may take 2-3 weeks. (The technical words for tumour improvement are regression or remission, both of which can be partial or complete). People who do respond to interferon may be recommended to continue taking a maintenance dose for as long as they can tolerate it. Researchers have also examined the combination of AZT plus alpha interferon. Most trials found that this resulted in tumour regression in more than 40% of cases. Most people who take alpha interferon experience side-effects which are usually flu-like symptoms and, occasionally, liver toxicity and/or neutropenia (shortage of neutrophils). The neutropenia may be avoidable by using the growth factor GM-CSF to stimulate neutrophil and white blood cell production. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is a form of treatment given by injection into a vein. Chemotherapy just means 'drug'. Cytotoxic means 'poisonous to cells'. The idea of these treatments is that they poison fast-growing cells, like KS cells, more than normal cells. But there are also other cells which normally grow quickly. These include cells in the bone marrow, hair follicles and the gut. So side-effects of these drugs tend to include bone marrow damage (resulting in anaemia and some immune damage), hair loss (alopecia) and diarrhoea. Different drugs do this to different extents, so a cytotoxic chemotherapy regime (treatment usually consists of a combination of three or more different drugs) is tailor-made for each person. For example, if someone already had bone marrow damage from AZT, it would be better to use a drug like vincristine, which causes less marrow damage. Cytotoxic drugs etoposide (VP-1 6), tenoposide, vinblastine and vincristine. Because these drugs are so toxic, researchers have developed new versions which are wrapped up in fatty coats to form particles called liposomes. These prevent the drug itself from being released into the bloodstream and causing side-effects; however, they leak out of the bloodstream into KS lesions where the active drug is released, effectively targeting it to the lesions. The two main drugs being tested for KS are liposomal doxorubicin and liposomal daunorubicin. Results to date suggest that they are effective treatments and cause relatively few side-effects. It is important to take PCP prophylaxis while receiving chemotherapy, because the treatment itself causes immunosuppression which increases the risk of opportunistic infections. Anti-angiogenic drugs, which interfere in the process by which new blood vessels grow within cancerous tumours, are starting to come into trials against KS. In a test-tube study the anti-angiogenic drug SP-PG suppressed the growth of KS in cells in animal cells either more effectively or with much less toxicity than current treatment drugs. Another anti-angiogenic drug under development is AGM- 1470. There are anecdotal reports that people who are improving generally on AZT have resolving or stabilising KS lesions, but no conclusive research exists yet. Another experimental avenue involves the use of Tat inhibitors. If Tat does play an important role in the pathogenesis of KS, drugs that target it may have specific benefits for people with KS in addition to anti-HIV effects. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) is a hormone that is naturally produced during pregnancy, when it is secreted bythe placenta, and to a lesser extent during the normal menstrual cycle. It is a licensed treatment for infertility in women and for low sperm count or for stimulating the production of testosterone in men. At the 10th International Conference on AIDS, Dr Robert Gallo reported that HCG prevented the development of KS in female mice infected with KS cells and destroyed lesions in mice which had already developed KS. The action of this hormone may explain the rarity of KS in women, as well as two case reports in which women with KS whose lesions spontaneously disappeared when they became pregnant. Studies of HCG as a treatment for KS are underway. References on the cause of KS Archibald CP et al.

Radiation and topical therapy Chak and Quivey reported that radiation therapy can be an effective method of reducing facial oedema (accumulation of fluid below the skin or in the cavities of the body) and treating KS lymphoedema (accumulation of fluid because the lymphatic system is blocked). Epstein treated 42 people with oral KS with intralesional injections of vinblastine (0.2 mg/ml) under local anaesthesia. A greater than 50% reduction in the lesions was seen in 74% of patients. The mean duration of response was 3.52 months for all patients. For patients not lost to follow-up and observed until recurrence of the oral lesions, palliation was achieved for a mean of 4.25 months. Bonhomme treated 7 men with KS with all-trans-retinoic acid (2 mg/kg/day orally for a mean of 4 months). Median CD4 count was 122. 3 participants showed partial responses (flattening, depigmentation and decrease in obduration and size of lesions), 3 had stable lesions but decreased oedema and 1 had progressive disease. Clinical toxicity was limited to dryness of skin, myalgia and headaches. 5 participants developed new lesions after treatment was discontinued, but not during treatment. Bailey enrolled 13 people with cutaneous KS (mean CD4 count 181) in a phase 1/11 trial of all-trans-retinoic acid 100 mg/m orally every other week for 12 weeks). In a preliminary analysis, all 10 evaluable participants experienced KS progression and no changes in CD4 count or p24 antigen were observed. von Roenn conducted a Phase II study of all-trans-retinoic acid. 6 participants received 175 mg/m/day; five developed rapidly progressive disease after a mean duration of therapy of 31 days. 8 participants were treated with 100 mg/m/day; two have stable disease and remain on treatment, one had stable disease but elected to discontinue due to malaise and the other 5 discontinued due to toxicities. Boente described the sustained clearing of KS lesions on an individuals foot after local injections of 400 g recombinant GM-CSF. Interferon Krown and Groopman reported response rates of 30-50% when treating cutaneous KS in patients with no history of opportunistic infection or systemic symptoms with alpha interferon. Mitsuyashi described objective responses in approximately 30% of people treated with high doses (above 20 MU/m). There is a strong correlation between dose and response Rozenbaum reported on 120 patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma treated by 18 million units of recombinant alpha-2A -interferon daily and followed prospectively for 1-6 years. An overall complete response was observed in 35%; the figure was significantly higher in those who did not have a visceral localization or opportunistic infections. Total lymphocyte count, CD4 lymphocyte count, and CD4/CD8 ratio were significantly higher, and beta2-microglobulin significantly lower, in the responders than in the non-responders. Kovacs treated 39 HIV-positive patients with KS with AZT (250, 100, or 50 mg orally every 4 hours) and 6 weeks later with interferon-alpha (5 million units/day increased every 2 weeks until a maximum tolerated dose was determined). Patients then received the maximum tolerated dose of the combination for a minimum of 12 weeks. In the dose-escalation phase, the ability to tolerate interferon-alpha was clearly related to the AZT dose. Only 1/13 patients receiving 250 mg AZT could tolerate at least 10 million units/day interferon-alpha. 8/12 patients receiving 100 mg AZT tolerated 10 million units/day, 5 tolerated 15 million units/day and none tolerated higher doses. 8/12 receiving 50 mg AZT tolerated 10 million units/day, 7 tolerated 15 million units/day and 6 tolerated 20 million units/day or dysfunction (10%). Of the 22 patients who received a stable dose of both drugs for 12 weeks, 11 showed a complete or partial tumour response and 8 showed an anti-HIV response. Beaulieu randomised 118 people with KS to receive AZT (500 mg/day) plus either high-dose (8 million units/day subcutaneously) or low dose (1 million units/day subcutaneously) alpha interferon. Response was measured by reduction in number and/or flattening of lesions. 29% of the high-dose arm had a complete or partial response, compared with 15% of the low-dose group. High-dose recipients had a significantly shorter mean time to onset of response than low-dose recipients (2.94 versus 5.9 months) and their response was maintained for significantly longer (mean 7.13 versus 2.86 months). More high-dose recipients required interruption or reduction of interferon because of adverse events, and only 10 participants tolerated 8 MU/day for the 4 month duration of the study. Krown (1992) reported that concomitant GM-CSF can maintain an adequate neutrophil count during combined treatment with alpha interferon and AZT. However, constitutional side-effects of the combination prevented significant increases in the dose of alpha interferon used. Miles treated 39 people with advanced KS with beta interferon (90 MU/day or 180 MU/day subcutaneously for 5 days per week). 6/39 (16%) had objective responses, including 2 complete responses. Responses were not dose-related. All recipients experienced fever, night sweats, fatigue and headache; no haematological toxicities were seen. Chemotherapy Laubenstein reported a 30% complete response and a 46% partial response among 41 people with KS and favourable prognostic characteristics treated with etoposide (150 mg/m intravenously for 3 consecutive days every 4 weeks), with a median duration of response of 9 weeks. Myelosuppression and GI toxicity were tolerable. Schwarstmann (1991) reported a 40% response rate among 25 people with KS treated with tenoposide, an analogue of etoposide. An ACTG (ACTG 110) phase I study of weekly oral etoposide (VP-16) for KS is currently being analysed; preliminary findings suggest that no significant tumour regression occurred. Lassoued treated 60 people with disseminated KS and CD4 counts below 400 with bleomycin, either intramuscularly (5 mg/day for 3 days every 2-3 weeks) or by continuous intravenous infusion (6 mg/m over 4 days). Overall 48% responded to treatment with no difference between the two regimens. Toxicity was mild with occasional fevers and skin rashes. Fischl treated 53 people with KS and no previous treatment with doxorubicin (intravenously at a dose of 15 mg/m). 51 participants were evaluable for toxicity and 50 for tumour response. 5 people had a partial response (10%); 32 a minor response (64%); 12 no change (24%); and one progression (2%) as the best measurable response. Partial response durations ranged from 4 to 14 weeks. Fifteen patients subsequently showed progression while on treatment. A significantly greater number of people with cutaneous disease alone (20.1%) had a partial response compared with those with visceral involvement (0%). The major toxicities included nausea and moderate to severe neutropenia (71%). Two participants developed cardiac toxicity. Gill (1990) reported response rates of 45 to 88 percent and median survival of 9 months in patients with aggressive cutaneous or visceral vincristine Gill (1991 a) that the combination of adriamycin (20 mg/m) with bleomycin and vincristine produced significantly higher rates of complete and partial KS resolution than adriamycin alone (88% vs 48%). Liposomal therapies Gill (1991b) enrolled 30 KS patients with CD4 counts below 200 in a phase 1/11 dose-escalating study of liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin. 18/30 showed a partial response and 12/30 had stabilized disease. Most frequent toxicities were leukopenia in 5/30 and nausea/vomiting in 5/30. A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 255 [Page 256](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/262?q1=directories) Chew treated 22 people with HIV and biopsy proven KS (10 cutaneous lesions and 20 with extensive disease) in a Phase II trial of liposomal daunorubicin (40 mg/m every two weeks). One patient had a complete response, 20 had partial responses and one had stable disease. Breakthrough lesions in 8 people who received reduced or delayed doses responded to subsequent full dose or escalation to 60 mg/m. Side-effects were minimal and infrequent: immediate side-effects included episodes of mild nausea (22%), headaches (2%) and less frequently, fatigue, vomiting or diarrhoea. Moderate haematological toxicities included low absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) and anaemia in patients on multiple drugs. No cardiac toxicity was observed. Wernz treated 42 people with advanced KS which had progressed despite prior chemotherapy treatment with liposomal daunorubicin (40 mg/m, rising to 60 mg/m if no response was seen). 28 had stable disease and 14 had partial responses (reduction in the number or size of tumours). Neutropenia was a dose-limiting toxicity. Essentially no alopecia or nausea was seen and there was no evidence of cardiac toxicity. The main side-effect is shortage of neutrophils, white blood cells that attack bacteria and fungi, although this could be managed by treatment with a drug that stimulates neutrophil production. Conventional daunorubicin causes hair-loss and can damage the heart, but these problems were avoided with the liposomal form. Presant treated 25 patients with advanced KS (median 20 lesions) with liposomal daunorubicin (40 mg/m every 2 weeks). Of 24 evaluable patients, 2 had complete remissions and 13 had partial remissions. 5/11 patients with doxorubicin resistant KS had partial responses. Median duration of response was 12 weeks. Myelosuppression was the commonest adverse event; vomiting, alopecia and stomatitis were rare and mild. Ross presented Phase II data on 31 people with KS who received and tolerated doses of liposomal daunorubicin of up to 60 mg/m every two weeks. Significant but tolerable myelosuppression occurred. Response occurred more rapidly than seen in Phase I studies using 40 mg/m, with a trend towards an increased percentage of complete response at the higher doses. In a compilation of results of Phase II studies of liposomal daunorubicin involving a total of 56 evaluated participants, 95% showed clinical benefit, 60% showing a complete or partial response and 30% showing stabilisation of disease. Common side-effects of chemotherapy such as nausea, vomiting and fatigue occurred in less than 10% of the more than 500 treatment cycles. Dormann compared the safety and efficacy of liposomal-encapsulated daunorubicin (LD) mg/m) vinblastine and bleomycin or etoposide in two matched groups of 7 AIDS patients with advanced KS. In the CC group, 2 patients achieved complete response, 4 a partial response and 1 had stable disease. In the LD group no complete response was seen, 6 subjects showed partial response and 1 had progressive disease. 1 patient in the CC group stopped therapy due to drug toxicity. Effective treatment of pulmonary KS was seen after 10 weeks of LD in 1 subject. The plasma half-life of LD was approx. 11 hours. The International DOX-SL Study Group treated 133 people with moderate-to-severe KS with liposomal doxorubicin. Almost all received doses of 10 or 20 mg/m, rising to 40 mg/m in non-responders. Using ACTG criteria, 3 (2.3%) had a complete response, 81 (61%) had a partial response, 38 (28.6) had stable disease and 11 (8%) had disease progression. Degree of response did not seem to be correlated with dose. Eleven participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Hengge reported interim results from a Phase II study of liposomal doxorubicin (20 mg/m every 2 weeks. 10/10 patients with low-risk KS and 9/10 patients with high risk KSachieved a partial response; the remaining patient with high-risk KS had stable disease. 3 high-risk patients had progression after an average treatment of 43 weeks. Myelosuppression was the commonest side-effect. Milliken enrolled 26 people in Phase II study of liposomal doxorubicin (20-40 mg/m 2-4 times weekly). Among 18 participants who completed at least 2 cycles of therapy, cutaneous lesions regressed in 16, including 5 partial remissions and 1 complete remission. Systemic symptoms resolved in all evaluable participants. Pulmonary disease, present in 3 people, did not respond, although their cutaneous lesions regressed. Toxicity was minimal. Angiogenesis inhibitors Pluda reported preliminary results from a Phase I study of TNP-470, an analogue of fumagillin. 14 patients have been treated at doses of 4.6, 9.3, 15.4 and 23.2 mg/m intravenously every other day. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, although two participants developed small, asymptomatic retinal flare haemorrhages. No KS responses were observed, although one participant had reduction in KS-related oedema and some self-reported a decreased development of new lesions. Higher doses are bing assessed. Nakamura reported that SP-PG, a sulphated polysaccharide-peptidoglycan compound produced by bacteria, controlled the in vitro growth of AIDS-associated KS-derived spindle-shaped cells at non-cytotoxic 256 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS concentrations. Angiogenesis induced by KS cells in the chicken corioallantoic membrane assay was blocked by SP-PG, as was the angiogenesis associated with the induction of KS-like lesions by subcutaneous inoculation of human KS cells into nude mice. Wellstein reported that pentosan polysulphate (PPS) showed strong inhibition of autocrine and paracrine growth stimulated by AIDS-KS cells. Sidky reported that interferons are able to inhibit angiogenic lesions induced in mice and modulate growth factor production. References on treating KS Bailey J et al.

Daunoxome (R) - phase II trial for epidemic Kaposis sarcoma (EKS). 10th Intl Conf Lymphocytic interstitial also known as lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis/pneumonia, which predominantly occurs in children with HIV. Its cause is still not clear, but is thought to be due to infection of the soft tissues (parenchyma) lining the lung, either by HIV itself or by another infection such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). HIV-infected children who develop LIP are diagnosed as having AIDS. Symptoms and diagnosis LIP causes shortness of breath, rapid breathing (tachypnea) and cough which get gradually worse. These are often accompanied by swollen glands, enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and eye inflammation (uveitis). In severe cases LIP causes shortage of oxygen in the body, leading to problems such as clubbed fingers. A chest X-ray will show that something is wrong but may not distinguish it from other problems. So a bronchoscopy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of LIP, rather than PCP or bacterial pneumonia. In adults, LIP is hard to diagnose because the symptoms could have a number of causes, and because LIP is often accompanied by recurrent bacterial pneumonia which can mask a proper diagnosis. Treatment Steroids have been reported to lead to considerable improvement in LIP, but the symptoms tend to recur rapidly if the treatment is discontinued, so long-term use is necessary. Because it is possible that LIP is caused by HIV itself, AZT has been tried in its treatment, but with variable benefits. References Blanche S.

Am J and Mycobacterium intracellulare are very similar bacteria which are usually grouped together. In America, they are usually described as Mycobacterium avium complex, or MAC. They belong to the same family as the organism which causes TB (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). MAI is now the most commonly reported bacterial infection among people with AIDS in the USA. MAI organisms are found in soil and tapwater throughout the world and are generally thought to enter the body in food, water or inhaled dust. They have been detected in the hot water and shower systems of some hospitals as well as in domestic tap water, leading some to suggest that people with CD4 counts below 100 should boil water used for drinking or food preparation and bathe instead of showering. The organisms are probably not infectious from one person to another. In people with healthy immune systems, MAI rarely causes illness. However, in people with HIV who have CD4 counts less than 100 - and often below 20 - MAI can spread widely (disseminate) throughout the body, affecting almost any organ, but especially the liver, spleen and bone marrow. They mainly infect cells of the reticuloendothelial A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 257 [Page 258](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/264?q1=directories) system, a group of related cells in the body that includes macrophages. Research has suggested that alcohol may help MAI to grow - more MAI organisms grew in the liver, spleen and bone marrow of deliberately infected mice which were given alcohol (ethanol) than in mice which were not give alcohol, and alcohol promoted MAI growth in human macrophages in the test-tube. It is therefore theorised that people with HIV who drink alcohol excessively may be at special risk of developing MAI-related disease. Symptoms Disseminated MAI organisms spread widely throughout the body, infecting the blood, spleen, liver, bone marrow and lymph nodes. This may cause high fevers, severe anaemia, night sweats, chills and weakness. If the gut is involved, symptoms can include chronic diarrhoea with malabsorption of nutrients, and abdominal pain due to ulcers in the gut. If the organisms have spread to the lymphatic system, symptoms can include enlarged lymph nodes and spleen. MAI can rarely cause mouth ulcers. Laboratory tests often show that people with MAI are anaemic, have low levels of platelets in their blood (neutropenia) and high levels of protein (as revealed by a test called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or ESR) and alkaline phosphate. Diagnosis The symptoms of MAI can have many possible causes, so the best way to diagnose MAI is to test whether MAI organisms can be grown from a sample of the individual's blood. If the bacteria can be found in the blood, the individual is described as having MAI bacteraemia. MAI can also be diagnosed by trying to grow the organisms from samples of the liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen or rectum. One study found that 43% of people who had being diagnosed with AIDS for two years developed MAI bacteraemia. Treatment The currently available anti-MAl drugs seem to be unable to eradicate the organisms from the body. Trials have suggested that treatment for MAI can reduce the number of actively multiplying organisms and alleviate the symptoms. It is less clear whether treatment can prolong survival in people who have developed MAI. American guidelines on treating MAI advise that, except in clinical trials, treatment should always consist of a combination of two or more drugs, one of which should be the antibiotic clarithromycin or azithromycin. Clarithromycin is the only licensed drug in the USA for treating disseminated MAI in people with AIDS. Its side-effects, which are mainly gastrointestinal such as nausea and diarrhoea, are usually mild and short-lived. At a dose of 500 mg twice a day it can clear organisms from the blood, improve symptoms and perhaps prolong survival. However, MAI organisms have been shown to become resistant to clarithromycin when the drug is used on its own, and people with resistant organisms are more likely to experience a resurgence of MAI. Studies have suggested that azithromycin reduces the number of bacteria in the blood and improves symptoms. It has similar side-effects to clarithromycin. In Britain treatment combinations also often include the drug rifabutin. It causes relatively few side-effects but they include reductions in white blood cells and platelets, rashes, gastro-intestinal upsets and darkening of the skin. There have also been reports of eye inflammation (uveitis) among people receiving rifabutin. Other drugs used in rifampin, gentamicin, amikacin, ethambutol, ciprofloxacin, clofazimine and sparfloxacin. Treatment for MAI should ideally be continued indefinitely, as long as symptoms improve and the number of MAI organisms in the blood is reduced. Prophylaxis In 1993 rifabutin was licensed for prescription as prophylaxis against MAI. Clinical trials showed that a dose of 300 mg/day was able to delay the development of MAI bacteraemia in people with low CD4 counts. Rifabutin recipients were also less likely to develop fever or fatigue than people given an inactive placebo, although there was no difference in other possible MAI symptoms such as night sweats, abdominal pain or diarrhoea. Current US guidelines recommend that HIV-positive people whose CD4 count is below 200 should start to take rifabutin tablets and continue indefinitely. If they do develop MAI, they should switch to a combination drug treatment regime. In Britain, rifabutin is not routinely prescribed primarily because its efficacy in preventing or delaying the actual symptoms of MAI (rather than MAI bacteraemia) has not been established. Promising preliminary results have been seen from studies testing clarithromycin. However, some clinicians are concerned that using only one drug for prophylaxis may lead to resistance. A trial of clofazimine was recently stopped as it appeared to have no effect in preventing MAI. Research on treatment Masur and the US Public Health Service Task Force on Prophylaxis and Therapy for Mycobacterium avium Complex issued guidelines in September 1993. They recommend that HIV-positive people with CD4 counts below 100 should receive rifabutin (300 mg/day) prophylaxis against MAI and continue to take it indefinitely or until active MAI disease occurs. If MAI disease is diagnosed, treatment should include at least two agents, including either azithromycin or clarithromycin. Bermudez reported that, in vitro, MAI grew more rapidly in human macrophages and murine Kupffer cells when the cells were exposed to ethanol (10-100 g/dl). Additionally, black mice were infected intravenously with MAI and given ethanol as 4% of total daily calories. After 21 days, significantly greater numbers of MAI were found in the blood, liver and spleen of the ethanol-treated mice than controls. The investigators suggest that chronic ethanol consumption may be an important factor in the development of MAI infection in people with AIDS. Montecalvo reported that MAI could be isolated from 32% of domestic tap water samples taken from the homes of 81 people with HIV in New York. 3 samples were of the same serovar as MAI isolates from the residents. Nightingale prospectively monitored 1,006 patients with AIDS for the development of MAC bacteraemia. Among patients who survived for 2 years after an AIDS diagnosis, 43% had developed MAC bacteraemia. The risk of developing MAC bacteraemia increased as the CD4 count fell, and most cases occurred in patients with CD4 counts below 100. Horsburgh reported that a group of 39 patients with untreated DMAC had significantly shorter survival, mean of 5.6 +/- 1.1 months (median 4 months), than 39 matched patients with AIDS but without DMAC, mean 10.8 +/- 1.3 months (median 11 months). The survival of 16 additional 258 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS [Page 259](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/265?q1=directories) patients with DMAC who received antimycobacterial therapy, mean of 9.5 +/- 1.4 months (median 8 months), was not significantly shorter than that of an additional 16 matched control subjects, mean 11.7 +/- 1.9 months (median 11 months). Patients with treated DMAC survived significantly longer than those with untreated DMAC. It is concluded that untreated DMAC significantly shortens survival, and that patients with DMAC who receive antimycobacterial therapy do not experience the shortened survival seen in untreated DMAC. Chaisson enrolled 108 patients with DMAI in ACTG 157, a dose-comparison study of clarithromycin (500, 1000, or 2000 mg twice a day). An interim analysis was performed on the 72 participants, with evaluation based on bacteriologic and clinical assessments. Eradication (99% reduction in bacterial count) or partial eradication (90% reduction) occurred in 44% of the low-dose group, 78% in the middle-dose group and 94% at the higher dosage level after 2 weeks. At four weeks the differences between the groups were reduced, and at 8 weeks all regimens were equally efficacious (approx. 80%) in bacterial suppression. Fevers and night sweats improved in 76%, 47% and 75% of participants. Adverse effects, predominantly GI, occurred in 90% of participants, leading to discontinuation in 3 patients (500 mg), 2 patients (1000 mg) and 11 patients (2000 mg). In vitro resistance to clarithromycin developed in 16 participants, and was accompanied by a return of clinical symptoms and/or increased colony-forming units in some patients. Dautzenberg reported on a multicentre open trial of clarithromycin in 77 people with late-stage AIDS. M. avium was eradicated from blood cultures in 11 (63%) of 16 evaluable patients receiving daily doses or 500 or 1000 mg and in 45 of 46 (98%) of those receiving 1500 or 2000 mg. Eradication after 2 months was influenced by continuity of drug treatment; 36 of 42 patients with no relapse had received continuous treatment versus six of 14 patients whose drug treatment had been stopped for 7 days or longer. After 2 to 7 months of treatment, acquired resistance associated with relapse was observed. Drug side effects were elevated liver enzyme levels (26%) and impaired hearing (4%). Concomitant AIDS drugs had no favourable effect on outcome and may have worsened liver toxicity. A dose-escalation study of the combination of clarithromycin and AZT in HIV-positive people found that the maximum tolerated dose of clarithromycin was 2000 mg twice a day; higher doses caused severe abdominal pain. Additionally, clarithromycin altered the pharmacokinetics of AZT, interfering with absorption and reducing peak concentrations by approximately 20%. The investigators suggested that people taking clarithromycin and AZT may need to take AZT several hours before or after a clarithromycin dose. Young conducted the first uncontrolled phase I study using azithromycin monotherapy for DMAI in 24 patients with AIDS. 3 groups of patients with positive blood cultures for M.avium received 500 mg oral azithromycin daily for 10 days (group 1), 20 days (group 2), or 30 days (group 3). The mean concentration of mycobacteria in blood decreased in each of the groups, with the greatest reduction (-1.37 log) occurring in the 30-day treatment group. In the groups treated for 20 to 30 days, fever, night sweats and splenomegaly were all reduced. Fatigue, weight loss, Karnofsky score and appetite did not improve. Diarrhoea was the most common side-effect, but it did not lead to discontinuation of therapy. Preliminary in vitro data suggest that some patients may have developed MAI strains resistant to azithromycin during treatment. Berry randomised 65 evaluable patients with MAI to receive a daily dose of either 600 mg or 1200 mg of azithromycin. At 6 weeks 56% of blood cultures were sterile in the 600 mg group compared with 42% of the 1200 mg group (nss). Side-effects, predominantly gastrointestinal, were more common at the higher dose. Young and co-workers have enrolled AIDS patients with disseminated MAI in a blinded, multi-dose safety and efficacy study of sparfloxacin and ethambutol. Participants receive sparfloxacin 200 or 300 mg/day for 8 weeks, with ethambutol 15 mg/kg/day added for the second four weeks. Bacteriological data from patients in the first two dose groups have been analyzed. CFU counts decreased in 4/10 patients in the 200 mg group and 3/12 patients in the 300 mg group. CFU counts decreased in 18/22 patients during the combination phase of the study. No overall improvement in the patients' clinical status was observed. Chiu enrolled 1 7 patients with AIDS/DMAI in a prospective, uncontrolled study of the combination of ciprofloxacin, ethambutol and rifampicin, with intravenous amikacin for the first 4 weeks. For 15 patients who completed more than 4 weeks of treatment, bacteraemia decreased (the mean MAI colony count fell from 537 to 14/ml) and systemic symptoms improved. In 8/10 patients who completed 12 weeks of treatment, bacteraemia was reduced at 12 weeks; it increased in 2/10. 7/17 withdrew before week 1 2 due to gastrointestinal intolerance and hepatic toxicity. The investigators concluded that this combination regimen effectively reduces bacteraemia and symptoms in patients with AIDS/DMAI. Kemper (1992a) treated 41 AIDS/DMAI patients with a regimen and clofazimine. 8/41 received weeks 5 to 8. 31/41 were evaluable. After a mean treatment duration of 9.8 weeks, fevers abated in 25/28, and night sweats and diarrhoea improved in 24/27 and 9/14 respectively. Bacteraemia was significantly reduced by the second week of treatment; this was significantly correlated with reduction in fevers. 19/41 patients had to have at least one drug discontinued from the regimen due to toxicity. Kemper conducted a follow-up trial to study whether the drugs used were effective as single agents (1992b) or in two-drug combinations (1992c). 60 AIDS/DMAC patients were randomized to receive rifampin, ethambutol, or clofazimine for four weeks. A significant reduction in MAC bacteraemia was observed in the ethambutol group only. Patients were then crossed over to receive a combination of the other two agents (ethambutol + clofazimine, clofazimine + rifampin, or ethambutol + rifampin) for 4 weeks. No two-drug combination caused a significant decrease in bacteraernia. Morrissey reported that 79 people with AIDS and DMAC have enrolled in a randomized phase II/111 trial of rifampin, ciprofloxacin, clofazimine, and ethambutol with or without amikacin during the first four weeks (ACTG 135). Drops in MAC colony counts have been observed in both treatment groups. Overall, 49% of patients had negative blood cultures after 4 weeks of therapy. Hoy treated 25 patients with MAC bacteraemia with a quadruple regimen of rifabutin, clofazimine, isoniazid, and ethambutol. Mycobacteraemia was cleared in 22/25, and 18 patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms associated with MAC infection. All MAC isolates were resistant to clofazimine, isoniazid, and ethambutol. 16/24 isolates were resistant to rifabutin. Improved results of treatment may be related to the use of a higher dose of rifabutin (300-600 mg/day) compared with other studies (150-300 mg/day), earlier diagnosis and institution of treatment, and synergy between rifabutin and ethambutol. Kerlikoske reported that in a retrospective study for the 2 years 1988-89 76 patients with AIDS and disseminated MAI infection treated with at least 3 agents were compared with 74 who received no treatment or isoniazid alone. Median survival in the 2 groups was 191 and 80 days, respectively. Treatment with more than or equal to 3 drugs and with zidovudine was associated with survival. Jacobson treated patients with AIDS and DMAI infection with rifampin (600 mg) plus ethambutol (25 mg/kg) plus ciprofloxacin (750 mg) or matching placebos daily for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, MAC colony-forming units had decreased by at least 1 log/ml in 4/9 treated patients versus 0/10 placebo recipients while increasing by at least 1 log/ml in 1 and 7, respectively. While the average combined clinical response score declined in both groups, it tended to decrease less in treated patients. On the other hand, dose-limiting toxicity (primarily nausea and adverse drug interactions) occurred in 9/12 treatment versus 1/12 placebo patients. Benson treated 20 AIDS patients with a five-drug combination regimen (amikacin, clofazimine, rifampicin, ethambutol and ciprofloxacin). was 30 days or until dose-limiting toxicity was reached; oral treatment was continued indefinitely. 19/20 had a favourable clinical and microbiological response (mean follow-up 6 months). Side-effects included ototoxicity in 3/20. Nightingale enrolled 21 patients with AIDS and DMAI (median entry CD4 count 6) in a phase 1/11 G-65 (liposome-encapsulated (1.7, 3.4 or 5.1 mg/kg) intravenously twice a week for 4 weeks. 1 patient at the highest dose developed reversible renal failure; no other toxicities were observed. All doses of TLC G-65 gave serum levels above the in vitro inhibitory concentration. A one-log reduction in MAI colony-forming units in the blood was observed after treatment, and 4/6 evaluable patients on the highest dose had reduced symptoms and night sweats. A phase II study of GLC G-65 in combination with clarithromycin and ethambutol is underway. Squires treated 2 AIDS patients MAI bacteraemia with high-dose IFN-gamma (500-1000 g/m/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks). 4 weeks after adding IFN-gamma to an ineffective multidrug chemotherapeutic regimen, 1 patient responded with a 75% reduction in MAI colony-forming units/mm. In the other patient who was also receiving anti-MAl chemotherapy, the addition of IFN-gamma for 4 weeks appeared to delay a subsequent increase in the level of bacteraemia. 4 additional AIDS patients with persistent MAI bacteraemia were treated with IFN-gamma (2 x 107 units/mg subcutaneously three times per week for 4 or 6 weeks) either alone (n = 3) or in conjunction with anti-MAl chemotherapy (n = 1). One or two initial doses of 250 g/m produced high fever and rigours in each patient, necessitating a reduction to 100 g/m. Three patients (A, B, and C) had not received prior treatment for MAI infection and were treated with IFN-gamma alone. Patient A showed no response to 4 weeks of IFN-gamma therapy; patients B and C showed transient responses. In contrast, in patient D, who developed a progressive increase in bateraemia (59-360 cfu/ml) during 8 weeks of treatment with three new anti-MAI agents, the addition of IFN-gamma to the same chemotherapeutic regimen induced a sustained decline in bacteraemia. These results suggest that, when used alone, IFN-gamma has a transient or no effect on MAI bacteraemia. However, IFN-gamma might have an adjunctive role in the population of AIDS patients who remain bacteraemic despite chemotherapy. Holland treated 7 people with refractory disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infections who were not infected with HIV with interferon A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 259 [Page 260](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/266?q1=directories) gamma (subcutaneously two or three times weekly in a dose of 25 to 50 g/m in addition to antimycobacterial medications. Within 8 weeks of the start of interferon gamma therapy, all 7 patients had marked clinical improvement, with abatement of fever, clearing of many lesions and quiescence of others, radiographic improvement and a reduction in the need for paracentesis. 59 (out of an anticipated 90) patients with AIDS and DMAI have enrolled in a phase 11/111 trial of rifampin, ciprofloxacin, clofazimine, and ethambutol with or without amikacin (ACTG 135). Drops in MAI colony counts have been observed in both treatment groups. Ten patients have died. Research on prophylaxis Rifabutin (300 mg orally once daily) has been approved as prophylaxis for MAI in HIV-positive people with CD4 counts below 200. This recommendation was based on the results of two studies published by Nightingale (1993), which found that rifabutin effectively delays or prevents MAC bacteraemia compared to placebo in people with AIDS who have CD4 counts under 200. Neither study showed a clearcut impact on clinical symptoms or a difference in survival between rifabutin recipients and placebo recipients. The two randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled studies both enrolled people with AIDS and CD4 counts below 200. Rifabutin monotherapy was administered at a dose of 300 mg/day. In the first study (Adria 087027) MAI bacteraemia developed in 51 of 298 placebo recipients (17%) and 24 of 292 rifabutin recipients (8%). In the second trial, bacteraemia developed in 51 of 282 people in the placebo group (18%) and 24 of 274 people in the rifabutin group (9%). Rifabutin significantly delayed fatigue, fever, decline in the Karnofsky performance score, decline in the haemoglobin level, elevation in alkaline phosphatase and hospitalization. The incidence of adverse events was similar with rifabutin and placebo. Overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups, although there were fewer deaths with rifabutin (33) than with placebo (47) during the double-blind phase. A UK/Australia study which had the same structure to these two studies has been stopped and the results are under analysis. Mandigo reported that in an open uncontrolled prospective study of 300 people with CD4 counts below 100 who had ever received rifabutin prophylaxis, 31% stopped treatment and 6 individuals developed MAI during a 6-month period. Thisis significantly lower than the most conservative estimated MAI incidence in this population from the literature, suggesting that rifabutin is effective in preventing clinical MAI. Pierce presented preliminary unblinded observations from a multicentre trail in which 682 people with CD4 counts below 100 receive clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) or placebo as MAI prophylaxis. 5.7% of participants have withdrawn due to adverse events. A total of 57 cases of MAI have occurred; historical data suggest that 87 cases would have been expected in untreated people. The development of MAI strains resistant to clarithromycin has not been observed. Abrams reported a trial of clofazimine (50 mg by mouth every day) for MAI prophylaxis which was stopped after seven of 56 participants on clofazimine developed evidence of DMAI in blood cultures, compared with six of 54 untreated people.

SMicrosporidiosis Microsporidiosis is illness caused by fairly recently-discovered protozoan parasites called Microsporidia. Prior to the AIDS epidemic only 11 cases of microsporidiosis had ever been reported in the medical literature. The most common of the parasites is Enterocytozoon bienusi, which infects the small intestine and has also been reported as a cause of sinusitis and, possibly, cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts in the liver). Other species of Microsporidia include Encephalitozoon hellem and cuniculi and Septata intestinalis - as well as affecting the gut, these parasites can infect macrophages 260 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS [Page 261](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/267?q1=directories) and spread throughout the body, including the eyes, sinuses, kidney, liver, muscles, brain and several other tissues. The mode of transmission of microsporidiosis is unknown, though many people with microsporidiosis have a history of extensive foreign travel or overseas residence. Other proposed forms of transmission include unprotected sexual activity and eating food contaminated with Microsporidia. Symptoms do not always occur immediately after infection. Some researchers are uncertain that Microsporidia are really a cause of diarrhoea in people with HIV, since they have found that the organisms are just as common in the faeces of people with HIV who do not have diarrhoea. Symptoms and diagnosis Microsporidiosis is associated with heavy diarrhoea and, because nutrients are not absorbed properly from the gut, weight loss. Other characteristics can include cramping stomach pains, nausea, wind and irregular bowel movements. These symptoms appear to be intermittent, and may have been coming and going for some months before the individual seeks medical advice. In some cases you may notice undigested food or tablets in the faeces. In the past, diagnosis depended on detecting the parasites is a sample of tissue taken from the small bowel by using an electron microscope. This was problematic because the small bowel is relatively slow to heal, and because it was so time-consuming. Now, however, E. bieneusi infection can be easily diagnosed by examining a stool sample (faeces) using one of three staining techniques. When the organisms have spread to other parts of the body they can be detected by using the same tests on samples of urine or from water used to flush the sinuses. Treatment There is no standard treatment for microsporidiosis. As in cryptosporidiosis, some drugs may just stop the diarrhoea without clearing the parasite. This means that as soon as the drug is stopped, the diarrhoea will return. Metronidazole has shown some success in alleviating the symptoms, but does not seem to eliminate the parasites themselves from the gut. Similarly, albendazole seems to be helpful in alleviating symptoms, and it may sometimes be able to clear S. intestinalis organisms, although it appears less effective against E. bieneusi. In a number of individual cases itraconazole has been reported to be effective against microsporidiosis affecting the eye. Atovaquone is also being tested as a microsporidiosis treatment. Some success in relievinbg the symptoms has been reported using standard anti-diarrhoea medicines such as loperamide or lomotil. Cutting down the amount of fat in the diet and increasing simple carbohydrates may also help. Low fat nutritional products may help in meeting nutritional needs and relieving some symptoms. Grinding up tablets or capsules may help if these are passing through the system undigested. Research Kotler studied 1 12 HIV-infected patients with diarrhoea, 82 of whom had a diagnosis of AIDS. 27/82 AIDS patients and 0/32 non-AIDS patients had microsporidiosis. Schwartz described several patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic pulmonary microsporidiosis resulting from E. hellem, and suggests that disseminated microsporidial infections are increasing in significance. Eeftinck Schattenkerk treated 19 patients with Microsporidium-associated diarrhoea with metronidazole (Flagyl) 500 mg three times a day, by mouth. Diarrhoea improved in 10 and resolved completely in five. 12/15 responders relapsed within 4 weeks of stopping drug. The effect of metronidazole was symptomatic only; duodenal biopsies showed Microsporidia regardless of response to treatment. Blanshard treated six AIDS patients with intestinal microsporidiosis with albendazole 400 mg twice a day for 4 to 6 weeks. All patients improved clinically (reduced daily stool frequency). Four patients who relapsed at 19-31 days after the cessation of treatment responded to a second course of albendazole. Degenerative changes occurred in the parasites after treatment, which had not been seen either in pre-treatment biopsies or, in four patients, following therapy with other drugs. The investigator is developing a larger phase 1/11 study. Dieterich treated 29 people with AIDS, chronic diarrhoea, and confirmed E. bieneusi infection with albendazole (400 mg twice daily). 26 patients were evaluable (three patients who died in the first month were excluded from analysis). After 28 days of treatment, the mean daily number of bowel movements decreased from 7.0 to 3.8 stools/day and the mean weight of the group increased 0.56 kg. E. bieneusi was not cleared from the patients' follow-up small-bowel biopsies. No significant side effects were observed. Sandfort treated 9 people with confirmed microsporidiosis with albendazole (400 mg twice daily). Complete response (no symptoms and negative stains for Microsporidium in the faeces) was observed in one participant and partial responses (improved symptoms, with positive stains for Microsporidium) were observed in six participants. Two participants had no response. A double-blind placebo-controlled phase 1/11 trial of atovaquone for microsporidiosis is underway at the NIH. No toxicity has been observed. However, since most of these patients suffer from severe malabsorption, the lack of toxicity might reflect low systemic drug levels. Rabeneck reported that E.bieneusi was isolated from the faeces of 18 out of 55 (33%) HIV-infected men with diarrhoea and 13 of 51 (25%) men without diarrhoea. Among people with chronic diarrhoea, no difference was observed in the intensity of infection between cases and controls. The researchers suggest that any association between microsporidiosis and diarrhoea may not be as stromg as is currently believed. References Blanshard C et al.

Shadduck JA et Microsporidia and human Molluscum contagiosum Molluscum contagiosum are skin lesions caused by a common pox virus. In adults with healthy immune systems they usually appear on the thigh or in the genital regions following sexual contact. However, in people with HIV they can spread widely, and they are particularly common on the face, where they can be spread by wet shaving with a A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 261 [Page 262](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/268?q1=directories) blade. About 10-20% of people with symptomatic HIV infection develop Molluscum contagiosum. Symptoms and diagnosis The viral infection causes small, pearly or waxy-looking flesh-coloured dome-shaped bumps about 2-4 rnm across. They may have a dent (or umbilication) in the middle. The infection is usually diagnosed by examination, although the bumps can sometimes be confused with warts caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) or certain fungal infections. To be absolutely certain of the diagnosis, the doctor will sometimes take a sample of one of the lesions for microscopic examination. Treatment This is not a serious condition, and treatment is primarily cosmetic. Applying liquid nitrogen every 1 to 2 weeks can help remove them; alternatively they may be treated with cantharidin and then scraped off. Applying tretinoin to individual bumps can also help. Injections of alpha interferon do not appear to be effective. Research Tappero enrolled 16 HIV-people patients with molluscum contagiosum (MC) and a CD4 count below 200 in a study of alpha interferon (5 million units injected subcutaneously every day for 8 weeks). 15/16 participants completed the study. Overall, no decrease in the number of MC lesions was observed. References Tappero JW et al. Alpha interferon for severe HIV-associated molluscum contagiosum. 8th is a mycobacteria - thge family of bacteria to which the causes of MAI and TB also belong. It is unique in that it requires haemoglobin or heme for growth. Its natural habitat and the ways in which it is transmitted remain unknown. It is rare even among immunosuppressed people such as people with AIDS. However, it can affect the skin, with the possibility of disseminating to the bones and to other organs. Symptoms and diagnosis Due to the very small number of reported cases and variable course of M. haemophilum infections, it is impossible to describe a clearly recognizable set of symptoms. Ulcerating skin lesions (especially on the extremities), joint effusions, and osteomyelitis have been reported. Lesions should be screened for mycobacteria with an acid-fast stain, and positive samples should be cultured in hemin-containing culture media at 30C. Treatment No clinical trials of treatments for M. haemophilum have been conducted, and there is no standard treatment. Transient responses to combinations of anti-mycobacterial drugs (such as rifampin, ciprofloxacin, ethambutol and clofazimine) have been reported. Soubani reported a complete response in an AIDS patient who received rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide for nine months. The individual remained asymptomatic for 12 months of follow-up after the discontinuation of therapy. The in vitro sensitivity of M. haemophilum isolates is widely variable, and susceptibility tests should be performed for each patient. References Armstrong D et al.

SMycobacterium kansasii Mycobacterium kansasii is a bacteria which belongs to the same family as the organisms which causes TB (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and MAI (Mycobacterium avium intracellulare). In people with damaged immune systems - with a CD4 count below 100 - it can cause lung problems, and can occasionally spread to other parts of the body. Symptoms and diagnosis Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The organisms can be detected by examining a sputum (spit) smear, fluid that has been flushed within the throat and lungs (bronchoalveolar lavage) or samples of lung tissue, or by trying to grow them from these samples. Chest X-rays frequently show the presence of thin-walled hollow lesions within the lungs. Treatment There is no standard treatment. M. kansasii seems to be sensitive to some anti-tuberculosis medications, such as rifampin, ethambutol, streptomycin and pyrazinamide. Research Levine conducted a retrospective chart review of 19 patients with AIDS and M. kansasii. Median CD4+ count at diagnosis was 49. 14/19 had exclusively pulmonary disease, 3/19 had pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease, and 2/19 had exclusively extrapulmonary disease. 10/19 received anti-tuberculosis therapy (nine had pulmonary disease and one had M. kansasii osteomyelitis). Patients received isoniazid and rifampin with ethambutol, streptomycin, or pyrazinamide. All treated patients improved clinically, with no evidence of relapse. All isolates were susceptible to rifampin and ethambutol. INH resistance was found in 4/10 patients, and all isolates were resistant to pyrazinamide. 5/9 untreated patients died with respiratory failure caused by M. kansasii. Driks reported the results of another retrospective chart review of 14 HIV-infected patients with M. kansasii. Presenting symptoms in these patients included fever (13/14), cough (10/14) and dyspnea (10/14). All M. kansasii isolates were resistant to isoniazid and sensitive to rifampin and ethambutol. 5/6 patients who were treated responded to rifampin- and ethambutol-containing regimens.

People with HIV can experience neuropathy either because of the direct effects of HIV on the nervous system, at any stage of infection, or because of opportunistic infections and tumours which affect the nervous system. It can also be caused by factors such as alcoholism and the toxic effects of certain treatment drugs, such as vincristine and ddl, and is a recognised non-HIV related complication of diabetes. It is not in itself an AIDS-defining condition. The nervous system consists of all the nerves in the body going to the muscles, skin and organs from the central nervous system (CNS). Peripheral neuropathy is nerve damage affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which runs from the central nervous system to all parts of the body. The PNS includes the autonomic nervous system which controls many body functions such as blood flow to internal organs, emptying of the stomach and bladder. Damage to these nerves is called autonomic neuropathy. Studies in people with symptomatic HIV infection have reported that about a third develop peripheral neuropathy. One study found that each year 8% of people with a CD4 count below 100 developed peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms The major symptom of neuropathy is pain, which can range from tingling discomfort through to burning sensations and a super-sensitivity to touch that can be so severe that just wearing shoes or socks or lying under bedclothes can be unbearable. These symptoms are usually symmetrical i.e. they affect both sides of the body equally. Symptoms often start at the soles of the feet and gradually get higher; many people only complain when the symptoms reach the ankles. Rarely, people experience similar symptoms in their fingers and hands. Other possible causes of these symptoms include alcohol and some recreational drugs such as heroin, cocaine, or amphetamines; some prescribed drugs such as isoniazid, CMV infection (rarely), and syphilis. It seems that these different causes of neuropathy can interact; people with mild neuropathy symptoms often find that they intensify after they start taking treatments such as ddl. The symptoms of autonomic neuropathy can include dizziness, diarrhoea and sexual impotence. Again, there are several alternative causes of these symptoms, such as various opportunistic infections and treatment drugs. Diagnosis Peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed on the basis of the symptoms, especially abnormal sensations in the feet and reduced or absent ankle reflexes, and the results of standard neurological tests. Electromyography (EMG), in which the electrical activity of a muscle is measured through electrodes, may also be used to detect nerve problems. Treatment These disorders do not usually improve with therapies like AZT. If the neuropathy is caused by a treatment drug such as ddl, the symptoms usually occur after a few weeks on the drug, and may continue for a few weeks even after the treatment has been discontinued. They then usually gradually reverse, although thalidomide has been reported to cause irreversible neuropathy in people with HIV. People who have to stop taking drug therapies because of neuropathy often find that they can later resume treatment at a lower dose without problems. The main purpose of treating neuropathy is to relieve symptoms. In mild cases where the symptoms are not affecting daily life, standard painkillers such as ibuprofen may be all that is necessary. If the symptoms are starting to be disruptive, tricyclic anti-depressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil), nortriptyline, doxepin and desipramine may help, starting at low doses. These drugs can take a couple of weeks to show any effects, and may cause side-effects of dry mouth, difficulty urinating, high blood pressure and drowsiness. These should be used with caution in people with dementia, as they can cause delirium (confusion and hallucinations). People with severe symptoms may require stronger pain killers such as methadone or injections of fentanyl. The anticonvulsants phenytoin and carbamazepine can be useful, especially if the pain is coming in brief bursts. Many people with HIV report that acupuncture helps relieve the pain of neuropathy, and a trial in the USA is assessing whether using acupuncture as well as anti-depressants makes for more effective treatment. Small trials have suggested that mexiletene (10 mg/kg/day) can reduce the symptoms of neuropathy, and similar results have been reported with Peptide T. Topical capsaicin can also be tried. An experimental drug, oxcarbazapine, is available on a named patient basis. Research Dejard reported that mexiletine (10 mg/kg/day by mouth) relieved the symptoms but not the signs of neuropathy in 16 patients with chronic painful diabetic neuropathy. Mexiletine is a congener of lidocaine currently used as a treatment for ventricular arrhythmias. A placebo-controlled trial of mexiletene (10 mg/kg/day) for HIV-related neuropathy is under way at the AIDS Community Research Consortium in Redwood City, CA. Preliminary results indicate 8/10 evaluable patients experienced 50% pain relief on subjective assesment. 2 did not improve. One patient was withdrawn due to disseminated MAI and CMV retinitis. Improvement was most likely to occur during the first 3 weeks of treatment, and symptoms returned within 1 week of cessation of treatment. Side-effects included transient gastrointestinal upset, nausea and vomiting. A pharmacokinetics trial of mexiletene in combination with AZT is under way in the USA. Doob reported on the use of Peptide T as a palliative treatment for HIV-related peripheral neuropathy. 9/27 patients given Peptide T (10 mg by subcutaneous injection every day) had symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. All these patients experienced either complete or subjectively significant resolution of pain as early as two days after treatment initiation. Numbness and sensory loss were unchanged but improvements in two patients with ataxia were noted. Recurrence of pain occurred in two patients whose doses were reduced to 2.5 mg every day and alleviated when the dose was increased to 5 mg/every day. Symptoms returned within one week of cessation of treatment. There were no reported side-effects. References Doob PR et al.

Cells that normally live in lymph nodes, particularly lymphocytes, start growing out of control and cause the node to swell up. Depending on the type of lymphoma, sooner or later these cells may spread to other parts of the body causing more damage. The other main kind of lymphoma is Hodgkin's disease. Non Hodgkin lymphoma, also known as B-cell lymphoma, is the commonest lymphoma seen in people with HIV, and is diagnostic of AIDS. When it first occurs in the central nervous system it is known as primary CNS lymphoma. This can occur at a wide range of CD4 counts, and 75% of people with primary CNS lymphoma have a count above 50. If the lymphoma spreads outside the CNS it is called systemic lymphoma. Systemic lymphoma can involve the bone marrow, internal organs such as the liver and kidney, the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system (CNS). 75% of cases occcur in people with a CD4 count below 50 who have already experienced multiple opportunistic infections. Cause The cause of NHL is unknown, but the disease is usually associated with over-active B-lymphocytes. No-one knows exactly why the B-cells become over-activated. Possible causes include HIV-related damage to the germinal centres in the lymph nodes, where in the healthy immune system B-cells are normally exposed to foreign organisms, HIV-related disruption to normal levels of cytokines and, especially, repeated stimulation by organisms such as viruses. The commonest virus to cause this kind of problem is thought to be Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which can be isolated from a high proportion of people with NHL. EBV is a common virus which has infected most people by adult life. On infection it may cause glandular fever, but afterwards it stays dormant in cells. There has been speculation that long-term use of AZT is a cause of NHL. This is based on laboratory studies, and tests in rats and mice, which have suggested that AZT may be carcinogenic. However, there is no evidence to date that long-term use of AZT causes cancer in humans. In August 1990 a study estimated that an unexpectedly high proportion of people with AIDS, treated with AZT, who had survived for three years would develop NHL. This suggestion caused much concern that the NHL might be caused by therapy with AZT. However, it has to be 264 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS emphasised that any causal link between NHL and therapy with AZT is currently only speculation. NHL has been seen in people with AIDS since the early years of the epidemic, before AZT was ever used. Most researchers believe that the increased incidence of NHL is a consequence of the longer survival in a state of severe immunosuppression of people taking AZT. This belief is supported by the fact that in other studies, less-immunosuppressed patients treated with AZT for a similar length of time do not show an increased incidence of NHL. Statistics on the occurrence of NHL in people with AIDS in London have found no evidence that people who have taken AZT for over 2 years or who have received high cumulative doses are at increased risk of NHL compared with people who have never taken the drug. Symptoms Nearly all people with HIV-related NHL are found to have systemic lymphoma. Common symptoms are fevers, enlarged lymph nodes and spleen, unexplained weight loss or drenching night sweats. Neurological problems can include headaches, confusion, memory loss, lethargy, partial paralysis affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis), loss of ability of speak or understand language (aphasia) and seizures. Diagnosis NHL can be diagnosed from a sample of bone marrow or lymph node, or from any other part of the body which is affected. Doctors will often also perform a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis, although a brain scan will not necessarily tell the difference between NHL and other brain problems such as toxoplasmosis. A sample of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be taken by lumbar puncture to check for malignant lymphoma cells. If there are gastrointestinal symptoms, the gut may be examined used a fibre-optic endoscope. Some blood tests can also be useful - these look for unusually high levels of lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) or uric acid. Treatment All treatment for HIV-related lymphoma should be considered experimental. The usual treatment for NHL which is concentrated in the brain (primary CNS lymphoma) is radiotherapy of the whole brain, usually accompanied by a short-term course of steroids such as dexamethasone to shrink oedema (swelling due to the accumulation of fluid) and the tumour. NHL in lymph nodes and skin may also respond well to radiotherapy. Disseminated lymphoma is usually treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs. In uninfected people, NHL responds well to aggressive treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, but this tends to be less successful in HIV-positive people. Studies suggest that people who receive intensive chemotherapy survive for longer than untreated people. People with CD4 counts above 200 are best able to tolerate aggressive treatment; reduced dose regimes may be better for people with counts below 100. Chemotherapy is usually given periodically, such as once every two weeks for six months, and anti-anxiety and anti-nausea medicines should also be offered. One possible drug combinations is m-BACOD (methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and dexamethasone) - one trial of this achieved a 46% response rate. Another option is CHOP [Page 265](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/271?q1=directories) (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone). Overall response in trial was 67%. These regimes can cause neutropenia (platelet deficiency). The addition of G-CSF reduces the severity and duration of neutropenia and is to be preferred over GM-CSF which risks increasing HIV replication. Other chemotherapy regimes include COMP and PRO-MACE/MOPP. Promising early results have also been reported with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and etoposide. It is important to take PCP prophylaxis while receiving chemotherapy, because the treatment itself causes immunosuppression which increases the risk of opportunistic infections. People who have disseminated lymphoma, especially when lymphoma cells can be detected in the bone marrow or the cerebrospinal fluid, may be offered treatment to try to prevent the lymphoma from spreading further. This consists of injections of cytarabine or methotrexate into the spinal column (intrathecally). Standard treatment for primary CNS lymphoma is whole-brain radiotherapy, which seems to result in improvement in symptoms in about three-quarters of recipients. There is no evidence that more aggressive treatments such as chemotherapy are more effective. There are a number of experimental approaches to treating NHL. It is thought that one possible cause of the over-active B-cells which are associated with NHL could be interleukin-6 (IL-6), which stimulates B-cells and suppresses T-cells. If true, treatments that inhibit IL-6, such as antibodies against it or other cytokines such as IL-4 could be helpful for NHL. IL-6 production is also stimulated by the cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), so TNF-inhibitors such as oxpentifylline or thalidomide might also be useful for people with NHL. Researchers are also testing newer chemotherapy drugs such as taxol and camptothecins. Research Peters found that the proportion of HIV-positive people who develop lymphomas at one London clinic doubled between 1986 and 1992, with a particularly marked increase in the number of lymphomas of the small bowel. A quarter of lymphornas were in the mouth or throat. The survival of people diagnosed with lymphoma also doubled since 1987; current mean survival was 120 days after diagnosis, or 190 days when lymphoma was the first AIDS-related illness. Chemotherapy treatment appeared to result in improved survival, with a small proportion of people experiencing stabilisation with a good long-term prognosis. A comparison of people who had taken AZT for over 2 years with those who had never taken AZT found no significant difference in the occurrence of lymphoma. There was also no evidence that people who have taken high cumulative doses of AZT were at increased risk of lymphoma. Herndier reviewed possible mechanisms for the pathogenesis of AIDS lymphomas. MacMahon reported finding evidence of latent EBV infection in 21 cases of AIDS-related primary CNS lymphoma studied at necropsy. Cinque detected EBV DNA in stored CSF from 1 7/1 7 patients with necropsy-confirmed primary CNS lymphoma, and in the tissue of 16/16 cases. EBV DNA was found in CSF from 1/68 HIV-infected patients without histologically detectable lymphoma at necropsy. It is suggested that EBV might therefore have a role as a marker in the diagnosis of AIDS-related primary CNS lymphoma. So reported focal neurologic signs such as hemiparesis (partial paralysis affecting one side of the body) or aphasia (loss of ability to speak or understand language) in 35%, seizures in 15%, and cranial nerve palsies in 10% of people with CNS lymphoma. Confusion, memory loss, and lethargy were reported in 60%. Gill reported changes in personality, apathy and confusion. Levine (1991) enrolled 42 people with AIDS-related malignant lymphoma in ACTG008, a study of a low-dose mBACOD regimen. Response rate was 51% with a complete response of 46%. Of 16 complete responses, relapse occurred in tour, none isolated to the central nervous system. Opportunistic infections occurred in 21% of those receiving treatment. Median duration of survival among all 42 patients is 5.6 months, 6.5 months in 35 patients evaluable for response, and 15 months in patients with complete response. Lower concentration of CD4 cells, history of prior AIDS, bone marrow involvement, and stage HIV disease were independently associated with decreased survival. Walsh reported that results from ACTG 074 (full dose mBACOD with GM-CSF) indicated complete response rate of 56% and a median survival of 10.5 months. ACTG 142, a randomised trial of reduced dose mBACOD versus full dose mBACOD with GM-CSF for NHL is under way. Clauvel treated 33 people with aggressive NHL and CD4 counts above 100. During weeks 1, 3 and 5 patients received doxorubicin (75 mg/m on day 1), cyclophosphamide (1.2 g/m on day 1), vindesine (2 mg/m on days 1 and 5), bleomycin (10 mg on days 1 and 5) and daily prednisolone (80 mg/m). During weeks 8, 10 and 12 they received cyclophophamide (1 g/m on day 1), etoposide (200 mg/m on days 1 and 2), methotrexate (3 g/m on day 2) and folinic acid. G-SCF (5 g/kg was administered on days 6 to 13 of each two-week cycle. After 14 months follow-up, 23 (70%) experienced complete remission. Median survival was 13.5 months. p24 antigen levels remained stable with G-CSF. Kaplan reported an overall complete response rate of 66% in a trial of CHOP with or without GM-CSF. GM-CSF significantly reduced the severity and duration of neutropenia, but in patients receiving GM-CSF median p24 antigen levels more than doubled from baseline, suggesting stimulation of HIV replication. Sparano reported on the treatment of intermediate to high-grade NHL associated with HIV (12 patients) or HTLV-I (2 patients) with cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m), doxorubicin (50 mg/m) and etoposide (240 mg/m). Complete response occurred in 10 patients (71%) and partial response occurred in 3 patients (21%). Median survival was 17.4 months, with 7/12 HIV-positive patients remaining alive and disease free after a median follow-up of 15 months. Tirelli reported the findings of a review of the medical records of 407 HIV-positive people in Italy who developed NHL since 1986. Some were treated with intensive, multiple drug combination chemotherapy regimes (Group 1), others received standard chemotherapy regimes (Group 2) and others received milder treatment using just 1 or 2 chemotherapy drugs or radiotherapy (Group 3). 61% of Group 1 experienced a complete response, compared with 48% of Group 2 and 27% of Group 3. However, people in Group 1 were also more likely to develop concomitant opportunistic infections during chemotherapy and follow-up than those in Group 2 (66% versus 38%). People in Group 1 had a 1.5 decreased risk of dying in comparison with Groups 2 and 3. Overall, 13 people had a complete response lasting for at least 2 years with a median survival of 42 months and none relapsed over follow-up extending in some cases to 6 years.

This was originally thought to be a protozoan, but more recently research has suggested that it may in fact be a fungus. It is relatively common throughout the population and does not cause problems in people with healthy immune systems. However, if the immune system is damaged the organisms can grow in the lungs, causing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). In people with HIV, the organisms can also sometimes grow in other parts of the body such as the lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, liver and, occasionally, the eye. Illness caused by Pneumocystis carinii is sometimes collectively described as pneumocystosis. PCP was first noticed in children who were immunosuppressed because of malnourishment. People with HIV are at risk from PCP if their CD4 count falls below 250-200. PCP was a common cause of death among people with AIDS during the early years of the epidemic, and it is still one of the most common AIDS illnesses. However, treatment and prophylaxis for PCP have improved dramatically, and now it is much more unusual for PCP to be fatal. The risk from PCP can be minimised by picking a clinic with good experience of HIV; reporting symptoms like coughing or breathlessness as soon as you can to your doctor; and finding out about prophylactic (preventive) treatment against PCP Studies have also shown that HIV-positive smokers develop PCP two to three times faster than HIV-positive people who do not smoke. One study found, encouragingly, that ex-smokers who had given up at least a year before they entered the study seemed to develop PCP no quicker or more frequently than non-smokers. The researchers suggest that smoking may directly affect the immune cells in the lungs, activating HIV infected cells and reducing the ability of immune cells in the lung tissues and airways to combat infections. Symptoms The commonest early symptoms of PCP, are shortness of breath and/or fever, which people with HIV should always take seriously. Other warning signs can include a persistent dry cough (one that doesn't produce any phlegm) and occasionally pain or tightness in the chest. At first the symptoms may only be noticeable after severe exertion, such as doing exercise or running to catch a bus, but as the condition worsens shortness of breath can become a noticeable problem during minor activity such as climbing the stairs, or eventually while doing nothing but relaxing. Weight loss, malaise and diarrhoea can also be less frequently associated with developing PCP. Diagnosis Doctors use a number of different tests to diagnose PCP, such as chest X-rays and measurements of the amount of oxygen in the blood. PCP should be suspected when an HIV-positive person who has a cough with shortness of breath and high fever, and anti-PCP treatments may be started presumptively. However, a variety of other infections can cause identical symptoms, and the only way to diagnose PCP definitively is to look for the Pneumocystis organisms themselves. Tests can detect Pneumocystis organisms in spit obtained by a process called sputum induction or, occasionally, in a sample of lung tissue which is removed using a fibre-optic instrument called a bronchoscope. Sputum induction is necessary because ordinary sputum (spit) does not come from deep enough in the chest to be able to detect PCP. Breathing in a mist of salty water makes people cough deeply enough that PCP and other organisms in the lungs are coughed up. This procedure can be uncomfortable, and may be less reliable than bronchoscopy. In bronchoscopy, a fibre-optic instrument is passed through the mouth or nostrils into the lungs. Salty water is squirted in and sucked out again. A fine pair of forceps are used to remove a tiny piece of tissue. This tissue and the salty water are then looked at, under a microscope, for PCP. Again, this procedure can be uncomfortable, and usually the nostrils and throat are treated with a local anaesthetic and a sedative injection is given. This is usually a type of morphine (which is good because it can help reduce coughing) and possibly diazepam (Valium) or a similar drug. Bronchoscopy can sometimes cause problems like worsening of infection or collapsing of the lung (pneumothorax). In many centres, sputum induction is the first test which is performed. If this doesn't confirm PCP or any other infection, bronchoscopy is done. Treatment An attack of PCP will normally be treated with either co-trimoxazole or intravenous pentamidine. The choice of which drug to use will depend on experience at that clinic, the doctors' preference, the severity of the infection and whether you have a history of allergic reaction to drugs' side-effects. In the USA, atovaquone is also licensed for treating mild-to-moderate PCP in people who cannot tolerate co-trimoxazole. Co-trimoxazole is usually given intravenously (15-20 mg/kg/day by continuous drip or 3 to 4 injections) for a 266 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS [Page 267](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/273?q1=directories) few days and then in tablet form for a total of 2/3 weeks. It is at least as effective as alternative PCP treatments and has the advantage that it also works against bacteria and some other infections; for example, it seems to provide a significant level of protection against toxoplasmosis. Its major disadvantage is that more than 50% of people experience side-effects from intravenous co-trimoxazole. These could be mild, like rashes or nausea - easily controlled with other agents such as ondansetron or by dose reduction - or in a minority of cases can be major, such as shortages of white blood cells (leukopenia) or platelets (thrombocytopenia) or kidney problems, requiring a switch to another treatment. A growing number of clinics try to desensitise people who are allergic to co-trimoxazole so that they can continue to use the drug. Dapsone plus trimethoprim. In this combination dapsone replaces the sulphonamide drug which is responsible for most of the side-effects with co-trimoxazole. It is usually used only for mild-to-moderate PCP. Dapsone (100 mg/day) is given by mouth and the trimethoprim (15 - 20 mg/kg/day in four divided doses) is given intravenously or by mouth depending on how severe the infection is. The combination is also effective against toxoplasmosis but less effective against any bacteria that may be present. Rarely, dapsone can cause vomiting or rashes. It may also damage blood cells (and so should always be given with the vitamin folinic acid). This is especially common in people with inherited blood disorders (usually from the Black communities) or in people on drugs which cause anaemia (high dose AZT, ganciclovir, cytotoxic chemotherapy). Intravenous pentamidine is used in people who experience serious side-effects with co-trimoxazole or with dapsone/trimethoprim. It is given as a daily drip (3 - 4 mg/kg/day). It appears to be less effective than co-trimoxazole and has no effects against other infections. Its side-effects include shortage of neutrophils (neutropenia), kidney problems and changes in blood pressure and blood sugar levels, sometimes causing diabetes. Another side-effect may be pancreatitis so it may be particularly unsafe for people on ddl. Aerosolised pentamidine (AP) is inhaled as a mist from a special machine (or nebuliser) which only affects the lungs. Virtually no drug is detected in the bloodstream. The dose for treating mild PCP requires once or twice daily administration and can cause a sore mouth and throat. AP is more commonly used for prophylaxis rather than treatment (see below). Clindamycin plus primaquine. The combination of intravenous clindamycin (600 mg four times a day) plus primaquine tablets (15 mg/day) has been shown to be effective in those who fail to respond to co-trimoxazole. It is a 'second line' drug with more side-effects but increased efficacy. Doctors may suggest trying it if co-trimoxazole hasn't worked after, say, 6 days. About 50% of people get a rash with it. Trimetrexate is a licensed treatment for people who do not respond to, or are allergic to, pentamidine and co-trimoxazole. It can suppress the bone-marrow causing shortages of various blood cells; this side-effect can be reduced by taking the drug with folinic acid (leucovorin). Atovaquone is a broad-spectrum antiprotozoal compound formerly known as 566C80. It seems to be about as effective as co-trimoxazole in treating mild to moderate PCP, and has fewer side-effects. It is recommended that the drug be taken with food in order to maximise the amount which is absorbed into the bloodstream. The preferred dose is 750 mg (three 250 mg tablets) orally three times daily for at least 21 days. Atovaquone is available on a named patient basis for patients who cannot tolerate or have not responded to treatment with co-trimoxazole. It is also recommended that all other treatment options have been considered before atovaquone is commenced. In moderate-to-severe PCP, steroids such as prednisone may be given alongside the PCP treatment. Although steroids are immunosuppressive, they have been shown to improve the success of treatment by dampening down inflammation in the lung. However, there may be an increased risk of other infections, such as thrush, herpes or bacterial infections, during the time the steroids are being taken. One study suggested that steroids also increase the risk of developing CMV disease. However, another study found no increase in herpes among people receiving steroids, and a decrease in CMV infections. There seems to be no benefit in using added steroids in cases of mild-to-moderate PCP. Other features of treatment for PCP You will probably need bed rest; even if you don't feel too bad at the time of diagnosis, you may do after treatment. Oxygen is given quite often, usually through a face mask; it can be quite annoying, but try to cope as it definitely speeds recovery. A special mask to raise the pressure of oxygen can sometimes be used. Aspirin or paracetamol is useful for bringing down a fever: it'll make you feel better, and bring up the oxygen level, although it could make you sweat. PCP or the drugs used to treat it can lead to loss of appetite. It may be helpful to see a dietitian, who can provide food supplements or replacements if needed. Anti-nausea medication may also help. It is fairly common for people with PCP also to have other infections in their lungs, such as Streptococcus or Staphylococcus. This increases the risk that the PCP will be serious. Other antibiotics may well be given alongside the PCP treatment in order to suppress or eliminate these other infections. Morphine may be given to help relieve symptoms. Prophylaxis It is clearly established that a person's risk of developing PCP rises significantly when their CD4 count falls below 200-250. A significant proportion of people do not notice any warning symptoms before the onset of the pneumonia. People with HIV are therefore normally advised to start taking PCP prophylaxis when their CD4 count falls below 200-250, or if they develop other AIDS-defining illnesses, to try to prevent a first attack of PCP (primary prophylaxis). The presence of an explained persistent daily fever above 1 OOC or candida in the throat is also a sign of increased risk of PCP, regardless of your CD4 count. People who have been treated for an episode of PCP are advised to continue to take low doses of anti-PCP A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 267 [Page 268](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/274?q1=directories) medications indefinitely, to try to prevent a further episode (secondary prophylaxis). With any prophylaxis it is important to weigh up the pros and cons, balancing the risk of side-effects and the inconvenience of taking the treatment against the risk of developing the opportunistic infection in question. However, the wisdom of using PCP prophylaxis is one of the few aspects of HIV/AIDS medicine where there is near consensus. Some researchers have calculated that PCP prophylaxis may in itself prolong survival. Co-trimoxazole is the most effective drug to prevent PCP. Several studies have shown few or no attacks of PCP among people taking one double-strength co-trimoxazole tablet a day over long periods of follow-up. It is used as prophylaxis at much lower doses than those used for treating active PCP, and side-effects are therefore much less common. People who have a mild allergic reaction may be able to develop a tolerance for the drug by reducing the dose and then gradually building it up to standard doses again over a period of weeks. Some research suggests that taking co-trimoxazole three times a week may be just as effective as once a day, with a much reduced risk of side-effects. Because co-trimoxazole is absorbed into the body through the gut and distributed around the body in the bloodstream, it can also help to prevent Pneumocystosis outside the lungs. It also offers a real level of protection against the opportunistic infection toxoplasmosis. The standard prophylactic dose of co-trimoxazole is 1 double-strength tablet on three days every week; studies have shown that this is just as effective as one tablet every day. Aerosolised pentamidine consists of the drug pentamidine isethionate which is converted into a fine mist and breathed directly into the lungs from a machine called a nebuliser. The usual dosing schedule is 300 mg once a month, which is all that is needed to ensure that any Pneumocystis organisms which are present in the lungs are kept under control; some clinics recommend once fortnightly doses to be extra safe. The drug can be administered in hospital or from a portable nebuliser at home; these cost about ~120, or can sometimes be obtained from social services. It may be important to lie down flat during the inhalation and move from side to side so the drug gets to all parts of the lungs. Aerosolised pentamidine is less effective than co-trimoxazole. Trials suggest that over a one-year period about 10-20% of people using it nevertheless develop a first episode of PCP. The study ACTG 021 found that co-trimoxazole is also more effective than nebulised pentamidine as secondary prophylaxis (i.e. for people who had recovered from an initial episode of PCP). People receiving pentamidine at 300 mg monthly were over three times more likely to experience recurrence of PCP within one year than those taking one double-strength tablet of co-trimoxazole every day. Some research suggests that higher doses of aerosolised pentamidine (300 mg/fortnight or 600 mg/month) are safe and may be more effective than 300 mg/month. The advantage of aerosolised pentamidine is that it causes few side-effects. Many people complain of a metallic taste during the treatment, but this soon disappears. The drug can also cause coughing fits, especially among smokers. Some people with HIV also find the regular visits to the clinic very inconvenient. Aerosolised pentamidine only reaches the lungs, so it offers no protection against Pneumocystosis in other parts of the body. Even in the lungs the inhaled mist may not reach all the lung tissue evenly. Dapsone is another tablet-form antibiotic. Early studies suggested that it is not as effective as co-trimoxazole. It causes side-effects such as rashes, nausea and occasionally hepatitis in about 10-15% of recipients. People who are allergic to co-trimoxazole are sometimes also allergic to dapsone. Other prophylactic options include sulphadiazine plus pyrimethamine and dapsone plus pyrimethamine. These are already widely used as anti-malarial drugs. They are likely to offer prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis as well as against PCP, but not against bacterial infections. There is a risk of skin rashes and both drugs may make the blood side-effects of AZT worse. Atovaquone has been reformulated into a version which is absorbed into the body better, and will now be tested as prophylaxis against PCP. Prophylaxis in children PCP is the most common manifestation of AIDS in children and is responsible for the majority of deaths in infants with HIV infection in the British Isles. Less than half of the children who develop PCP are alive 3 months later despite intensive treatment. Given this poor prognosis, prophylaxis is very important. However, the need for PCP prophylaxis is far more problematic in infants than in adults. The most frequent and severe cases of PCP occur in babies under 6 months old, anbd this is the period of time when it is most difficult to be sure whether or not the child of an HIV-positive mother is itself infected with HIV. When deciding when is the best time to begin PCP prophylaxis for an infant born to an HIV-positive mother there are therefore three different options to be considered. The first option is for all children born to HIV-positive women to take PCP prophylaxis from, say, 3 weeks old and continue until it is clear whether or not the child is infected with HIV. The problem with this approach is that for the one child who is prevented from getting PCP, about 50 will have received prophylaxis 'unnecessarily (either beacuse they are not infected with HIV, or they are infected but are not fast progressors and are thus not at risk from PCP). There is, however, the advantage that co-trimoxazole may help to prevent other bacterial infections. Another option is to start PCP prophylaxis as soon as a definitive diagnosis of HIV infection is made. There are also problems with this approach; for example, the infant may develop PCP before the diagnosis is made, and infants who are not fast progressors may receive PCP prophylaxis unnecessarily. For children who are not fast progressors, Co-trimoxazole helps prevent bacterial infections and early PCP prophylaxis may be beneficial in the long term. The third option is to start PCP prophylaxis if the CD4 cell count falls below certain levels - these are different from 268 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS [Page 269](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/275?q1=directories) adult values and depend on age. In America, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are constantly reviewing and changing the guidelines and many paediatricians are sceptical about whether it is possible to establish standards for beginning PCP prophylaxis based on CD4 count. A strategy based on CD4 values means that the baby must be followed very carefully and have frequent CD4 counts - at least once a month - since CD4 counts can fall very quickly. Key research on treating PCP Hughes enrolled 322 participants with AIDS in a Phase III randomised, double-blind trial comparing atovaquone (750 mg three times a day) with co-trimoxazole (320 mg TMP/1600 mg SMX three times a day) for the treatment of mild to moderate PCP. Therapy was successful in 99/160 (62%) patients and 103/162 to co-trimoxazole. More patients in the atovaquone group failed due to lack of response, while more patients in the co-trimoxazole group failed due to drug toxicity (20% of atovaquone recipients and 7% of co-trimoxazole recipients discontinued due to inadequate response, while 7% of atovaquone recipients and 20% of co-trimoxazole recipients discontinued due to drug toxicity). Toxicities included rash, liver function abnormalities, vomiting and fever. Mortality within four weeks of the completion of treatment was higher in the atovaquone group (11 patients) than in the co-trimoxazole group (1 patient). Dohn compared atovaquone (750 mg orally three times a day) to pentamidine (3-4 mg/kg/day intravenously) as primary or salvage therapy in patients with mild or moderate PCP. Among 56 patients with primary PCP randomized to receive atovaquone, 57% were treated successfully, 29% had no response, and 4% had a dose-limiting side-effect. Among 53 patients randomized to pentamidine, 40% responded, 17% had no response and 36% had treatment-limiting side-effects. Mortality was equivalent in the two groups. Leoung treated 15 patients for a first episode of mild to moderate PCP with trimethoprim (20 mg/kg orally every day for 21 days) and dapsone (100 mg orally every day for 21 days). All improved within 3-10 days. Side-effects (nausea, vomiting, rash) occurred in 14/15, with treatment discontinued in 2/15 (severe rash). Medina randomised 60 patients with AIDS and mild to moderately-severe PCP to receive either trimethoprim/dapsone (20 mg/day and 100 mg/day by mouth respectively) or co-trimoxazole (20 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day by mouth respectively). No patients received concomitant AZT. The regimens were equally effective, with 2/30 patients in the trimethoprim/dapsone group failing, and 3/30 in the co-trimoxazole group failing. Co-trimoxazole was associated with significantly greater toxicity: 9/30 patients who received trimethoprim/dapsone and 17/30 who received co-trimoxazole had a major adverse reaction requiring a switch to intravenous pentamidine. The most frequent toxicity in the trimethoprim/dapsone arm was rash; in the co-trimoxazole group elevated LFT, neutropenia and rash were most frequently observed. Rohde studied 15 patients with mild to moderate PCP who had been treated with clindamycin/primaquine (900 mg four times daily/30 mg every day for 21 days), matching them retrospectively with patients receiving co-trimoxazole. In both groups steroids were added on a declining dose if arterial oxygen pressure was below 70 mmHg. All patients showed clinical improvement. Response rates were similar in both groups. Relapse occurred in three patients in the co-trimoxazole group and in one patient in the clindamycin/primaquine group. In general, side-effects of co-trimoxazole were more severe and included marrow suppression, rashes, elevated liver enzymes, and gastrointestinal distress; clindamycin/primaquine was associated with methaemoglobinaemia. Montgomery enrolled 379 patients in a randomised, double-blind trial comparing co-trimoxazole to nebulised pentamidine (AP) for treatment of acute PCP. Adverse reactions (rash, elevated liver-enzyme levels, fever, neutropenia, and nausea) occurred more frequently in the co-trimoxazole group. Use of AP was associated with a slower clinical response, and was most effective against mild to moderate PCP. Investigators also noted that the risk of pneumothorax and extrapulmonary PCP appears to be greater with AP than with co-trimoxazole. Klein treated 160 patients with PCP with intravenous co-trimoxazole (TMP 20 or intravenous pentamidine (4 mg/kg/day, 68 patients) for 21 days in a prospective randomised treatment trial. 39 (42%) of the co-trimoxazole required change of therapy because of failure to respond, plus a further 31 (34%) due to drug toxicity. This compared to 27 (40%) and 17 (25%) of the pentamidine group, respectively. Overall survival rates were similar (67% (62/92) initially receiving co-trimoxazole; 74% (50/68) initially receiving pentamidine). For patients requiring a change of therapy due to failure to respond, survival rates were 46% (18/39) for co-trimoxazole and 56% (15/27) for pentamidine. For those requiring change of therapy due to toxicity, survival rates were 97% (30/31) for co-trimoxazole and 94% (16/17) for pentamidine. Conte treated 38 patients with mild to moderate first-episode PCP with nebulised pentamidine (AP) (600 intravenous pentamidine (3 mg/kg every day; 21 patients) for 21 days. Initial response to treatment in the two groups was identical; however, the rates of relapse and recurrence of symptoms were significantly higher in the AP group (6/17 on nebulised pentamidine and 0/21 on intravenous pentamidine had recurrent symptoms before the 28th day of follow-up after acute therapy; 4/17 on AP and 0/21 on intravenous pentamidine relapsed). Soo treated 21 patients with PCP with either nebulised pentamidine (8 mg/kg every day) or intravenous pentamidine (4 mg/kg every day) for 21 days and concluded that nebulised pentamidine was as effective as intravenous pentamidine for mild to moderate, but not severe, PCP. Waskin found that the incidence of transient diabetes among PCP patients was 22% with intravenous pentamidine and PCP prophylaxis. Sattler enrolled 303 people - d6uble-blind randomised study comparing trimetrexate with co-trimoxazole as first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe PCP. Failure rates due to lack of efficacy were 20% for co-trimoxazole recipients and 38% in the trimetrexate group. No co-trimoxazole recipients relapsed, compared with 12% of those treated with trimetrexate. 28% of people taking co-trimoxazole had treatment discontinued because of adverse events, versus 9% of trimetrexate recipients. ACTG 039 investigated trimetrexate in patients who did not respond to or were intolerant of co-trimoxazole and intravenous pentamidine. 84/159 (53%) patients intolerant to both standard therapies and 48/160 (30%) patients either unresponsive to both or unresponsive to one and intolerant of the other tolerated at least 14 days of treatment and survived at least one month. Investigators concluded that trimetrexate is a useful and well-tolerated salvage therapy. Feinberg evaluated the results of an expanded-access program which provided trimetrexate to 752 people unable to take co-trimoxazole and intravenous pentamidine. 34% of participants were classified as responders. Mills treated 18 patients for a first episode of PCP with dapsone (100 mg by mouth every day for 21 days). 11/18 improved within 3-10 days of therapy. 7/18 failed. Side-effects (rashes and abnormal liver enzymes) occurred in 6/11 patients. Safai reported on the use of eflornithine on a compassionate basis in AIDS patients with PCP who were intolerant of or unresponsive to traditional agents. Eflornithine is an antiprotozoal agent active against P. carinii. It acts by inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme that is essential for cellular function. The drug is initially administered intravenously, followed by oral therapy. Overall, the response rate has been about 35%; however, conclusions are difficult to make since patients had different stages of disease and received treatment for varying periods of time. Side-effects include depression of bone marrow function, diarrhoea, hearing loss, seizures, alterations in liver function tests, and rash. Evidence has suggested that P. carinii is related to fungi and that the wall of the cyst form contains 1,3-beta-glucan as a major constituent. Based on this, Schamtz evaluated several proposed 1,3-beta-glucan synthesis inhibitors for their ability to control P. carinii pneumonia in vivo. Compounds from two classes of 1,3-beta-glucan synthesis inhibitors, the echinocandins and papulacandins, were found to be effective against P. carinii. Bartlett reported that three 8-aminoquinolines inhibited growth of P. carinii in infected rat lung/human fibroblast cell cultures at 1 g/ml as much as primaquine did but were also effective in rats at doses at which primaquine was ineffective. All 3 showed good prophylactic activity in rats, comparable with that of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxaxole. Adjunctive corticosteroid administration (added to co-trimoxazole or intravenous pentamidine), when initiated at the beginning of treatment, has been demonstrated to decrease the potentially life-threatening inflammatory response and respiratory distress associated with moderate to severe PCP. A consensus conference convened by the NIAID to review the results of 5 separate studies determined that early adjunctive steroid therapy reduces the likelihood of death, respiratory failure and deterioration in moderate to severe PCP when adjunctive therapy is initiated as early as possible; no benefit has been proven in milder forms of PCP. The long-term benefit of adjunctive use of corticosteroids has not been established. Adjunctive corticosteroid treatment has not been shown to reactivate tuberculosis or fungal diseases with measurable frequency. Caumes reported that in a non-randomized retrospective chart review, corticosteroid use was associated with a reduced incidence of adverse skin reactions to co-trimoxazole in AIDS patients receiving treatment for acute PCP. 38 patients in the review received co-trimoxazole alone, and 23 received co-trimoxazole plus corticosteroids for hypoxemia. Rashes occurred 3/23 (13%) receiving corticosteroids. A significantly higher rate of mucocutaneous herpes simplex infections was observed in the patients receiving corticosteroids. A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 269 [Page 270](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/276?q1=directories) Nelson reported that corticosteroids may increase the risk of clinical CMV disease in patients with CD4 counts below 50. Keating randomised 60 people with mild PCP to receive standard anti-PCP therapy plus either steroids or an inactive placebo. After 6 months follow-up there was no difference in survival between the groups (73% survival in the steroid group compared to 75% in the placebo recipients). People treated with steroids were not at increased risk of developing CMV retinitis, although they were more prone to bacterial and fungal infections. The researchers conclude that people with mild PCP should receive standard anti-PCP therapy without additional steroids.

Key research on PCP prophylaxis Co-trimoxazole is the treatment of choice for the prevention of PCP. The US Public Health Service Task Force on PCP prophylaxis recommended co-trimoxazole (one double-strength tablet every day) for both primary and secondary prophylaxis of PCP in HIV-infected people with no history of severe reactions to co-trimoxazole and either prior PCP, a CD4 count below 200 or unexplained fever or thrush (CDC, 1992). Fischl conducted a placebo-controlled trial of co-trimoxazole (160 mg TMP plus 800 mg SMX twice a day) as primary PCP prophylaxis in 60 people with KS and no history of opportunistic infections. After three years, 53% of the placebo group had developed PCP and 93% of the group died; none of the treated group developed PCP and only 60% died. Several studies have shown that co-trimoxazole (1 double strength tablet) delivered three times a week (as opposed to daily) is effective as primary prophylaxis for PCP with reduced incidence of adverse reactions. Ruskin conducted a retrospective analysis of co-trimoxazole three times weekly as PCP prophylaxis in 116 patients (71 had a prior history of active PCP, mean follow-up 18.5 months; 45 never had PCP, but mean follow-up 24.2 had side-effects (rash, pruritus, nausea); 15/116 discontinued treatment, with 11/16 clearly drug intolerant. No comparative, prospective study of daily vs. thrice weekly co-trimoxazole has been completed. A randomized comparative study is under way through the California Collaborative Treatment Group. 107 HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts below 200 are enrolled. Bozzette reported the results of a blinded interim analysis. After six months, one case of presumed PCP had occurred. Hirschel conducted a placebo-controlled trial of aerosolised pentamidine (300 mg every 28 days administered by the Respirgard II nebuliser) as primary PCP prophylaxis in 223 people with CD4 counts below 200, advanced ARC or AID without prior PCP. Over one year, 23 cases of PCP occurred in the placebo group compared with only 8 in the treated group. Leoung enrolled 408 participants in a dose comparison trial of aerosolised pentamidine (30 mg every two weeks, 150 mg every two weeks, or 300 mg every four weeks). Eighteen months after randomization, the subjects in the 300-mg arm had had 8 confirmed episodes of PCP while receiving treatment, as compared with 22 in the 30-mg arm. The 150-mg arm had intermediate results but ones not significantly different from those of the 300-mg arm. Participants with previous episodes of PCP and CD4-cell counts less than 200 per cubic millimeter were at the highest risk for PCP. Golden reported that one-year rates of PCP among people receiving secondary PCP prophylaxis with aerosolised pentamidine at doses of 300 mg every fortnight or 600 mg every month were 6% and 8% respectively, compared with 19% in historical controls. Several studies have also established the efficacy of aerosolised pentamidine delivered through the Fisons as secondary PCP prophylaxis in 164 people who had had one episode of PCP and no other AIDS-defining opportunistic infection. Over a mean follow-up of 15.5 weeks, 27/32 (82%) PCP recurrences occurred in the placebo group. Murphy enrolled 175 patients in a blinded dose-comparison study of nebulised pentamidine 5 mg, 60 mg, or 120 mg every two weeks administered through the Fisons nebuliser. While the low-dose regimen was ineffective, the 60 mg and 120 mg regimens were equally effective. At 52 weeks, probability of being PCP-free was 88% in the 60 mg group and 93% in the 120 mg group. While these results establish the efficacy of nebulised pentamidine delivered through the Fisons nebuliser, a study directly comparing the Fisons and Respirgard II nebulisers has not been conducted. Bozzette and co-workers presented preliminary results from a trial (ACTG 081) comparing three regimens for the primary prophylaxis of PCP. 842 patients with CD4 counts below 200 and no prior history of PCP were 270 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS [Page 271](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/277?q1=directories) receive co-trimoxazole (one double-strength tablet daily), aerosol pentarnidine (300 mg monthly), or dapsone (50 mg twice daily). The median follow-up was 39 months. Upon intent-to-treat analysis, PCP occurred with equal frequency in the three groups. 42, 54 and 48 cases of PCP occurred in the co-trimoxazole, aerosol pentamidine, and dapsone groups, respectively (P = 0.22). Survival was equivalent in the three groups (134, 131, and 138 deaths). Significantly fewer side effects requiring a switch in treatment assignment occurred in the aerosol pentamidine group. The mean time to discontinuation of assigned treatment was 14.6, 17.1, and 13.7 months in the co-trimoxazole, aerosol pentamidine, and dapsone groups respectively. Schneider randomized 213 HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts below 200 and no history of PCP to receive co-trimoxazole (one single strength or double strength tablet daily) or aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg every 4 weeks via the Respirgard II nebulizer). After a mean followup of 264 days, 6/71 pentamidine recipients had a confirmed episode of PCP, while no patient in either co-trimoxazole group had PCP. Adverse reactions requiring treatment discontinuation were higher in both co-trimoxazole groups (17/71 on 480 mg/day and 18/71 on the aerosolized group Rizzardi randomized 220 patients (one double-strength tablet daily) or aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg monthly). After two years follow-up, intent-to-treat analysis showed that 6 and 5 patients developed PCP and 30 and 18 patients died in the co-trimoxazole and pentamidine groups respectively (differences not significant). The relative risk of mortality at two years was 1.2 in the pentamidine group compared with the co-trimoxazole group. Hardy randomised 310 AIDS patients who had recovered from one bout of PCP to receive either one double-strength co-trimoxazole tablet a day or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg every 4 weeks (ACTG 021). After a mean followup of 17.4 months, PCP had recurred rate for the aerosol pentamidine group was 18.5%, compared with 3.5% for the co-trimoxazole group. The risk of recurrence in the pentamidine group was 3.25 times that in the co-trimoxazole group. Adverse reactions requiring a change in treatment occurred in 42/154 (27%) of co-trimoxazole recipients and 6/156 (4%) of aerosolized pentamidine recipients. Rash and fever accounted for most of the toxicities. There were no differences in the rates of haematologic or hepatic abnormalities between the two groups. Survival was equivalent in the two groups. Borleffs randomized 230 patients with CD4 counts below 200 and no previous PCP to receive aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg once monthly) or one of two doses of co-trimoxazole (one single-strength or double-strength tablet daily). After 9 months' follow-up, an interim analysis showed that 11% of AP recipients and no co-trimoxazole recipients had developed PCP. Adverse reactions requiring a switch in treatment occurred in 2% of the AP group, 17% of the low-dose co-trimoxazole group and 18% of the high-dose co-trimoxazole group. Carr treated 60 people with AIDS with co-trimoxazole (1 double-strength tablet twice daily for two days a week) and 73 people with AIDS who had a history of sulphonamide allergy or severe intolerance with aerosolised pentamidine (300 mg every 4 weeks) as secondary prophylaxis against PCP. 1/60 co-trimoxazole recipients relapsed (1.7%), compared in the aerosolised pentamidine group (42.5%) and 21/38 untreated historical controls (55.1%). Median PCP-free survival times were more than 1153 days in the co-trimoxazole group, 496 in the pentamidine group and 265 days in the control group. The rate of or time to relapse was not influenced by CD4 count at the start of prophylaxis, primary therapy of PCP, history of allergy to co-trimoxazole or AZT therapy during the secondary prophylaxis period in any group. Both therapies were well-tolerated, with 3 (5%) of those receiving co-trimoxazole and 4 (5%) of those receiving pentamidine discontinuing therapy as a result of side-effects. A cost-benefit analysis performed by Castellano and Nettleman showed that first-line co-trimoxazole (1 double-strength tablet/day) resulted in better survival and lower cost than first-line AP (300 mg/month). This literature review determined that median survival after initiating secondary prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole was 2.050 years, compared with 1.983 years with AP. (The median survival without any prophylaxis was 1.345 years.) Blum prospectively compared dapsone (100 mg/day) co-trimoxazole double-strength tablet/day) for PCP in HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts below 200. After 1,638 patient months of followup, 1/47 patients randomized recipients and 25/39 co-trimoxazole recipients discontinued their study therapy, most frequently for rash. Ten patients switched from dapsone to co-trimoxazole, 4 successfully; and 1 1 patients crossed over from co-trimoxazole to dapsone, 6 successfully. Slavin conducted a randomized comparison of dapsone (100 mg PO twice weekly) and aerosolized pentamidine (400 mg nebulized monthly) for PCP prophylaxis in patients with CD4 counts below 200 or a previous episode of PCP. 37/50 dapsone recipients and 32/46 AP recipients had had a previous episode of PCP. Mean CD4 counts at entry were 128 and 124 in the dapsone and AP groups, respectively. All patients received AZT. After a median followup of 18 months, 9/50 dapsone recipients and 8/46 AP recipients had developed PCP (no difference). The rates of adverse reactions were equal in the two groups (4 rash and 2 nausea on dapsone, and 5 cough and 1 dizziness on AP). Opravil randomized 500 patients to receive either dapsone/pyrimethamine (200 mg/75 mg once weekly) or aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg once monthly via Respirgard II nebulizer). All patients had CD4 counts below 200 at baseline and 20% had had previous PCP. After more than 9 months' mean followup, intent-to-treat analysis showed that 7/273 dapsone/pyrimethamine recipients and 9/227 AP recipients had developed PCP (no significant difference). Intolerance requiring a switch in treatment occurred in 36% of dapsone/pyrimethamine recipients and 4% of AP recipients. Most frequent side-effects were nausea, fever, and haematologic toxicity. Girard randomized 349 symptomatic patients with CD4 counts below 200 to receive dapsone/pyrimethamine (50 mg daily/50 mg weekly) or aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg monthly) on an open-label basis. After a median follow-up of 539 days, 10/173 recipients 42 dapsone/pyrimethamine recipients and 3 aerosolized pentamidine recipients discontinued therapy due to toxicity. No difference in survival was observed. Studies suggest that low-dose dapsone (100 mg/week) with pyrimethamine may be ineffective for PCP prophylaxis. Antinori randomized 197 patients with CD4 counts below 200 and no prior PCP to receive dapsone/pyrimethamine (100 mg weekly/25 mg twice weekly), aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg monthly via Respigard II nebulizer), or co-trimoxazole (one double-strength tablet every other day). After a median follow-up of 7.7 months, PCP had developed in 1/66 pentamidine and co-trimoxazole respectively. Upon intent-to-treat analysis, the difference between the co-trimoxazole and D/P groups was significant. Other comparisons did not show significant differences. Podzamczer randomized 166 patients with CD4 counts below 200 to receive dapsone/pyrimethamine (100 mg weekly/25 mg weekly) or co-trimoxazole (2 double-strength tablets three times weekly). After a mean follow-up of 380 days, intent-to-treat analysis showed that PCP had developed in 13/85 (15.2%) dapsone/pyrimethamine recipients and 3/81 (3.7%) of TMP/SMX recipients. Mallolas reported, by contrast, that weekly dapsone/pyrimethamine may be comparable to standard therapies. 331 HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts below 200 or a previous diagnosis of AIDS were randomized to receive dopsone/pyrimethamine (100/25 mg weekly), aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg monthly) or co-trimoxazole (160/800 mg thrice weekly). The mean follow-up was 313 days. Upon intention-to-treat analysis, the PCP rates per year of observation were 8.3%, 5.6%, and 3.0% in the D/P, AP and co-trimoxazole groups, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant. Santin randomized 166 patients with CD4 counts below 200 to receive dapsone/pyrimethamine (100 mg weekly/25 mg weekly) or co-trimoxazole (2 double-strength tablets three times weekly). After a mean follow-up of 320 days, intent-to-treat analysis showed that PCP had developed in 11/81 (12.9%) dapsone/pyrimethamine recipients and 1/85 (1.2%) of co-trimoxazole recipients. Coker reported that in an open trial, PCP occurred in 17/142 patients (12%) receiving dapsone (100 mg three times weekly) plus pyrimethamine (25 mg three times weekly), compared with 2/84 (2%) treated with co-trimoxazole (960 mg three times weekly). Martin conducted a retrospective chart review of 211 HIV-infected patients, 131 of whom (62%) received primary prophylaxis and 80 of (38%) whom received secondary prophylaxis for PCP. First-line treatment was mean duration 5.7 aerosolised pentamidine (300 mg once monthly; n= 125; mean duration 9.3 months). 73% received concomitant antiretroviral therapy. PCP did not develop in those receiving co-trimoxazole, compared with 5 cases on dapsone and 17 on aerosolised pentamidine. 56% of the co-trimoxazole group and 55% of the dapsone group changed drug due to adverse reactions; only 2% in the aerosolised pentamidine group required drug change. In separate studies of Fansidar by Gottlieb and Fischl for PCP developed PCP; significant toxicities included Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Cheung conducted a retrospective review of 89 patients who received intramuscular pentamidine 300 mg or 4 mg/kg monthly as prophylaxis for PCP. 34/89 had prior PCP, the remainder had CD4 count below 210. After a median follow up of 8 months, 3/89 patients developed PCP. Toxicities A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 27 1 [Page 272](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/278?q1=directories) observed were 2 cases of hypotension, three sterile abscesses and three cases of glucose intolerance. Fisher described the experience of three patients who received atovaquone (750 mg three times daily) as prophylaxis for PCP. The 3 patients had multiple prior bouts of PCP, other AIDS-defining 01, and very low CD4 counts. All 3 were intolerant of co-trimoxazole, dapsone and aerosolized pentamidine. None of the patients had an episode of PCP during 3, 5 and 6 months of follow-up respectively. In order to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis, a randomized, open-label study is under way which compares atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg or 1500 mg daily with aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg monthly. All patients will have CD4 counts below 200, or a prior bout of PCP, or constitutional symptoms of HIV infection, and intolerance of co-trimoxazole. Nieman reported on a case series of 84 individuals with AIDS who provided accurate details of their smoking habits before their AIDS-defining diagnosis. Progression time to AIDS (all diagnoses) was significantly reduced in HIV-1 -seropositive smokers: median time to AIDS was 8.17 months for smokers (n = 43) and 14.50 months for non-smokers (n = 41). Smokers developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) more rapidly than non-smokers, with a median time to PCP of 9.0 months, compared with 16.0 months for non-smokers. Smoking had no significant effect on progression time to AIDS when not due to PCP. Buskin examined the medical records of 1204 HIV seropositive persons at seven outpatient sites in Seattle during 1990-1991. To exclude persons at minimal risk of PCP, the analysis was limited to persons with CD4 counts less than 500 with known smoking status (n = 598). There were 325 current smokers and 273 nonsmokers. Of the nonsmokers, 54 were known to be ex-smokers, 29 were never smokers, and the remaining 190 (70%) could not be further classified. Because the number of never smokers was small and because many current nonsmokers were likely to be ex-smokers with a high risk of PCP (odds ratio = 5.2 for ex-smokers relative to light smokers), light smokers (lowest pack-year tercile, less than 12 pack-years) were used as a reference group. One hundred and twenty-six persons (21%) had one or more episode(s) of PCP. There was a strong dose-response effect for intermediate smokers (12 to 19 pack-years) and heavy smokers (20+ pack-years) when looking at the outcome of ever having had PCP. The crude relative odds of PCP for the intermediate and heavy smokers were 3.1 and 5.6, respectively. After adjustment for CD4 count, gender, ethnicity, and use of PCP prophylaxis by logistic regression, the odds of PCP were 2.9 for intermediate and 3.5 for heavy smokers. Heavy smokers were over 3 times more likely to have had PCP than were light smokers. Key research on PCP prophylaxis for children In March 1991, the CDC released guidelines for the prophylaxis of PCP in HIV-infected children. Since young children have much higher CD4 counts than adults, the recommendations are stratified according to age. For children between 1-11 months, prophylaxis is recommended when CD4 counts fall below 1500 and monthly CD4 monitoring is recommended when CD4 counts fall below 2000. For children between 12-23 months, prophylaxis is recommended at 750 CD4 cells and monthly monitoring at 1000 CD4 cells. For children between 24 months and 5 years, prophylaxis is recommended at 500 CD4 cells and monthly monitoring at 750 CD4 cells. The recommendation for children over 6 is to begin prophylaxis at 200 CD4 cells and monthly monitoring at 300 CD4 cells. For any child whose CD4 percentage falls below 20%, prophylaxis is recommended regardless of age or CD4 count. The recommended regimen is co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim 150 mg/m /day by mouth with sulphamethoxazole 750 mg/m /day by mouth in divided doses three times a week on consecutive days (e.g. Mon-Tue-Weds). Alternative schedules include the same dosages given as a single daily dose three times a week on consecutive days; the same dosages given in two divided doses every day; and the same dosages given as two divided doses three times a week on alternating days (e.g. Mon-Weds-Fri). In the case of intolerance to co-trimoxazole, alternative regimens are nebulised pentamidine 300 mg/month via the Respirgard II nebuliser; dapsone (for children older than 1 month) 1 mg/kg/day by mouth; or intravenous pentamidine 4 mg/kg every 2 or 4 weeks. Hand evaluated the safety of aerosol pentamidine in infants. Seven infants (mean age 6.7 months) with HIV infection were given monthly treatments with aerosolized pentamidine, with the dose calculated to be equivalent to an adult dosage of 300 to 600 mg/month. The side-effects observed were similar to those seen in adults, with mild coughing and wheezing being most frequent. Simonds reported that an analysis of surveillance data collected by the CDC indicated that the incidence of PCP among infants has not declined substantially since prophylaxis guidelines were published. The lack of prophylaxis in 62% of cases of PCP in children between January 1991 and June 1993 could be attributed to the fact that infants were not known to be infected with HIV. Kovacs (1991) reported that of 21 perinatally HIV-infected children with PCP only 10 (48%) had CD4 counts below 500, compared with all 18 who were infected via blood transfusions or clotting factors. Among 68 children who 272 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS were 1 year or younger, 18/20 (90%) PCP cases had CD4 counts below 1500 compared with only 5/48 (10%) children who did not have AIDS. The mean CD4 count was lower for the 39 PCP cases when compared with the 188 children who were at different stages of HIV infection and did not have the AIDS independent of age. The majority of perinatally HIV-infected children with PCP were 6 months or younger and 50% were previously unknown to be infected. The European Collaborative Study Group followed 924 children born to HIV-infected mothers. PCP developed in 14 out of 111 children found to be HIV-infected. Of 11 children in whom CD4 counts were available within 3 months of diagnosis of PCP, only 3 had counts that were below the threshold for prophylaxis. Kovacs (1994) argued that the European Collaborative Study suggests that the current CDC guidelines may not lead to timely prophylaxis for most infants who will develop PCP. An alternative approach would be to provide prophylaxis to all infants born of HIV-infected mothers, at least during the 2-9 month period after birth when the risk of PCP is greatest, and to discontinue therapy as soon as the possibility that the child had HIV infection was excluded. Alternatively, the threshold for prophylaxis and the frequency of CD4 testing might be increased to allow better identification of children at risk from PCP. References Antinori A et al.

When the inflammation specifically affects the Fallopian tubes it is sometimes called salpingitis or endosalpingitis. It is thought to be caused mainly by infection with Chlamydia and gonorrhoea, although other pathogens such as mycoplasma, tuberculosis, actinomycosis, cytomegalovirus and herpes, or about 40 other sources of infection may sometimes also be to blame. Some of these other bacteria may be normal residents of the vagina which are allowed to grow abnormally by changes in the bacterial balance of the vagina. The uterus is normally protected from bacteria in the vagina by a plug of mucus and the endocervical canal; infection with Chlamydia or gonorrhoea is thought to damage the canal, allowing these and other organisms to penetrate into the uterus. Hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle may affect the protective mucus, which is also released during the menses. PID does not immediately result from infection; the causative organisms can produce low-level infection for weeks or even months before PID occurs. Without correct diagnosis and treatment, PID can become a recurrent, chronic or life-threatening health problem. With treatment, it is completely curable. Symptoms Symptoms of PID include acute or dull lower abdominal pain that lasts for more than a day or two; an abnormal discharge from the vagina; fever; vomiting; lower back pain or swelling; and fatigue. Untreated PID can also cause bleeding between periods, excessively painful periods, trouble walking due to the pain and other disabling conditions. In some case untreated PID can be life-threatening. Diagnosis The gold standard for diagnosing PID is laparoscopy - a type of exploratory surgery involving a small incision in the abdomen below the navel, which allows a tube-like lighted instrument (a laparoscope) to be inserted into the pelvic cavity for visual inspection. Non-invasive scans may provide information about the size of a woman's reproductive organs and may indicate any unusual growths (cysts or abscesses) which could be a sign of acute PID. The presence of sexually transmitted or infections can be detected by looking for the organisms in cultures or smear tests. A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 273 [Page 274](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/280?q1=directories) Treatment Treatment is with combinations of antibiotics which are effective against a range of sexually transmitted infections and bacteria. Suggested regimes include metronidazole plus doxycycline, or co-amoxiclav alone. In severe cases gentamicin plus a tetracycline may be required. References Hare J.

Pathogenesis of pelvic inflammatory disease: what are the questions? lymphadenopathy Persistent generalised lymphadenopathy (PGL) means having swollen lymph nodes in several parts of the body, which remain swollen for some time. The strict diagnosis of PGL requires you to have swollen glands in two or more parts of the body outside the groin, such as the neck and armpits, for 3 months or longer. It is thought to be an indication that the immune system is fighting back against HIV. PGL does not seem to have any particular prognostic implications - people who develop PGL seem to do no better but no worse than people who do not. Some people with HIV develop AIDS without ever having PGL; indeed, the PGL may start to shrink just before an opportunistic infection occurs. Symptoms and diagnosis The swollen lymph nodes feel like firm, painless bumps under the skin, usually about 1-2 cm across. They occur in the back of the neck, below the jaw line, in the armpits or in the groin. PGL is normally diagnosed from a physical examination. However, some HIV-associated diseases can also cause lymph node swelling, especially lymphoma and TB, although these usually only occur in people with relatively advanced HIV infection. These can be distinguished from PGL in a number of ways - they may affect lymph nodes in only one part or on only one side of the body; or the swollen lymph nodes may be tender; or they may be accompanied by a high temperature; or blood tests may help. Occasionally, a lymph node biopsy is required to be absolutely certain of the diagnosis. References Kaplan JE et al.

PML is caused by reactivation of a virus called the Jacob Creutzfeld (JC) virus, to which the majority of the population are believed to have been exposed, and to carry without symptoms in their kidneys. In an adult of child with a weakened immune system, the virus can be reactivated and spread to the brain by white blood cells from the bone marrow. Once in the brain, the virus infects the brain cells responsible for producing the protective sheath around the nerves (oligodendrocytes). Without this protection on the nerves, the nerve cells die and cause lesions in the brain. Neurologic dysfunction may follow quickly, and the condition can rapidly cause serious, life-threatening disease. The condition usually has a poor prognosis, although in rare cases people can spontaneously recover. Symptoms and diagnosis PML can cause a variety of symptoms related to mental functioning, including confusion, disorientation, lack of energy, loss of balance, weakness in the arms or legs (usually on only one side of the body), blurred or double vision, speech difficulties and loss of vision in one eye. Brain scans such as CT or MRI scans can reveal the presence of lesions in the brain, but a biopsy is the only way to be certain that these are due to PML rather than other opportunistic infections like toxoplasmosis. Treatment Research into treatments for PML is still at a very early stage. There have been some reports of reduction in symptoms among people treated with cytarabine injected either into a vein (intravenously) or into the spinal column (intrathecally), but other reports have found no substantial or lasting effects from this treatment. Research Fong studied the natural history of patients with proven and presumptive PML and the relationship to the CD4 count and the effect of systemic cytarabine (2 mg/kg/day for 5 days each month). The mean survival for 5 with CD4 counts above 100 was 7.2 months, and for 5 with CD4 counts below 100 was 5.8 months. There was no direct linear correlation between CD4 count and survival. 3 patients with proven PML and 2 with presumed PML were treated with cytarabine. No clinical improvement was observed. Britton reported benefits from intrathecal cytarabine in 13 people with PML (mean CD4 count 106). 8/13 stabilized and improved after treatment. Some researchers have also reported positive results with intravenous cytarabine. Portegies treated 3 AIDS patients with cytarabine (2 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for 5 days). Neurological improvement was seen after three courses of treatment. Partial resolution of lesions on MRI was seen after subsequent cycles of cytarabine. No adverse effects were seen with concomitant use of AZT. Symptoms did not resolve completely in any of the patients. Lidman reported a good response to cytarabine (2 mg/kg/day intravenously for 5 days every 15 days) in a patient with AIDS-related PML who was also taking AZT (1000 mg/day). AZT was suspended on the days of intravenous cytarabine. Side-effects included nausea and a slight decrease in white blood cells. Nicoli successfully treated 2 patients with PML with monthly intravenous cytarabine. Both improved after 3-5 cycles of therapy. De Truchis openly treated 8 AIDS patients with PML with intravenous cytarabine (2 mg/kg daily for 5 days, repeated monthly) plus intrathecal cytarabine (50 mg once a month). Mean CD4 count was 59. 6 of the 8 patients had three or more courses of treatment. In 2 patients, treatment [Page 275](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/281?q1=directories) was discontinued after the first course because of aplasia or severe neurological deterioration. In 5 other cases, anaemia and/or transient leucopenia occurred after cytarabine, but treatment was interrupted in only 1 case. Neurological status deteriorated despite therapy in 4 of 8 patients. Mild transient neurological improvement was observed after the second or third course of cytarabine in 3 patients, but then they rapidly worsened. In these 7 patients, sequential MRI showed progressive extension of the lesions. In the remaining patient, with isolated cerebellar PML (histological confirmation), long-lasting clinical improvement was observed with mild improvement on cerebellar MRI. This patient had also received zidovudine since the diagnosis of PML. Survival of the treated patients was 5.2 months (3-11), which is not different from historical and untreated patients. Urtizberea treated 7 people with PML with intravenous cytarabine and intrathecal cytarabine. Mean CD4 count was 60. Radiological amelioration was observed after 2 courses in only one patient. Clinical symptoms were transiently reduced in 3/7 but worsening was observed after 2-3 months in all patients but one. Allegre reported that no improvement was observed when intrathecal AZT was given for 3 months to 2 people with PML. Berger (1 992a) completed a pilot study of the combination of high-dose alpha interferon and AZT for the treatment of PML; no clinical improvement was observed. References Allegre T et al.

It is an auto-immune condition, which means that the immune system is attacking the body's own cells. People with HIV who have a history of psoriasis may find that HIV makes it worse, but the condition can also occur in people with no prior history. A small proportion of HIV-positive people with psoriasis also develop an associated arthritis, called psoriatic arthritis. Symptoms Psoriasis causes a flaky red rash rather like seborrhoeic dermatitis, but somewhat more scaly. It is also more likely to affect the armpits, groin, elbows, knees and lower back. Treatment Autoimmune problems are usually treated with drugs that suppress the immune system. In the case of psoriasis, medium to high potency steroid creams are used. If these do not work, stronger drugs such as etretinate may be used. AZT also sometimes improves psoriasis. * Salmonellosis Salmonellosis is illness caused by Salmonella bacteria, which belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae. The bacteria are transmitted in food and water, or sometimes from certain animals such as chicken, fowl, livestock, domestic pets and turtles, entering the body by the mouth then growing in the small intestine. In people with HIV the bacteria often spread into the blood and are transported to other parts of the body, causing recurring problems. HIV-positive people who repeatedly have Salmonella bacteria in their blood (i.e. they are bacteraemic) are diagnosed as having AIDS. People with HIV who have had salmonellosis may continue to excrete (infectious) Salmonella in their urine and faeces even after treatment with antibiotics, so it may be wise to take extra care with safer sex and when preparing food to avoid infecting others. Hygienic food preparation can help to prevent infection with Salmonella in the first place. Symptoms and diagnosis The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are non-specific problems such as fever, chills, sweats, weight loss, diarrhoea (which can be severe and bloody) and anorexia. Although bowel problems are common in AIDS, they are usually not caused by Salmonella. It is diagnosed by growing the bacteria from a sample of stool. Treatment In people with HIV, Salmonella infections are usually treated with a three week course of antibiotics. The most commonly used is ampicillin, but the bacteria are sometimes resistant to this. Alternatives include chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin), cephalosporin (Cec/or), ciprofloxacin and standard anti-diarrhoea medicines. Salmonellosis often recurs after an episode has been successfully treated, so long-term maintenance therapy may be necessary; some research suggests that AZT and/or co-trimoxazole may help to prevent recurrences.

It is a very common problem in people with symptomatic HIV infection. Its cause is unclear, but may be related to a fungal infection. Symptoms and diagnosis The symptoms are usually faint reddish patches on the skin that are sometimes swollen. The surface may be covered with greasy-looking yellow scales. It can usually be diagnosed by a physical examination, but may sometimes be confused with other skin problems such as psoriasis. If necessary, laboratory examination can reveal distinctive features that make a definitive diagnosis of seborrhoeic dermatitis possible. Treatment Seborrhoeic dermatitis often responds to treatment with a steroid ointment. Scalp problems can be relieved with coal tar or anti-dandruff shampoos. In severe cases treatment with anti-fungal cream or tablets such as ketoconazole, or ultra-violet light therapy, may be syndrome. Cutis 48(3):217-218, 1991. * Syphilis Syphilis is a complex sexually transmitted disease caused by a bacterium called Treponema pallidum. This is transmitted by contact with syphilitic sores or lesions. Soon after the organism enters the body it spreads throughout the body via the bloodstream or the lymphatic system. Nearly all organs can be invaded, including the central nervous system. At various times, it has been suggested that syphilis is the cause of AIDS, is a co-factor with HIV for AIDS, or causes HIV encephalopathy. None of these ideas has stood up to rigorous scientific investigation. Symptoms Syphilis can cause a range of symptoms or none at all, but if left untreated can have very serious effects on the brain and the rest of the nervous system (known as neurosyphilis). In HIV-negative people, initial infection with syphilis (primary syphilis) may cause a chancre (an ulcer, sore or spot) at the site of infection, usually in the genital region. This does not hurt and heals after a couple of months. The chancre is usually accompanied by swollen glands. Secondary syphilis can cause symptoms of rash, swollen glands, warts, various constitutional symptoms and, less frequently, other symptoms such as meningitis. 276 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS Neurosyphilis can occur at any stage of syphilis; syphilitic meningitis and meningovascular syphilis occur early (months to a few years after infection) and general paresis and tabes dorsalis occur later (5-30 years after infection). In addition to neurosyphilis, late syphilis can cause lesions in almost any organ of the body. In people with HIV the course of the disease may be different. There seems to be an increased risk of brain involvement, and unusual symptoms may include skin and mouth ulcers and fever. It is also possible that HIV speeds up the course of syphilis. Diagnosis In HIV-negative people, the only sure tests are blood tests called the TPHA and VDRL. Some studies have suggested that these tests are not as effective in people with HIV; some people who do have syphilis may test negative, and some who do not may test positive. Sometimes doctors may want to perform these tests on a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taken from the spinal column by lumbar puncture. Treatment Syphilis is normally treated with a course of antibiotics. Again, there is some evidence that in people with HIV standard treatment may be inadequate; a number of reports have described cases when ulcers did not heal, the bacteria were still detectable or neurosyphilis developed after standard therapy had been completed. In HIV-positive people, syphilis is usually treated with high doses of antibiotics such as penicillin or doxycycline. Research Standard treatment for early syphilis is parenteral penicillin (benzathine penicillin G). However, prospective studies to establish the most effective drugs and dosages have not been conducted. CDC recommends a single dose of 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin G administered intramuscularly for both HIV-negative and HIV-infected patients. Musher proposed higher doses (three 2.4 million unit doses at weekly intervals) in order to prevent possible relapse to neurosyphilis. While ceftriaxone (500 mg or 1 g intramuscularly every day for 10 days) may be an effective alternative regimen, it has not been conclusively evaluated. In the penicillin-allergic HIV-positive patient with early syphilis, some clinicians use doxycycline as an alternative to desensitization or ceftriaxone. For late latent syphilis of more than one year's duration with no CSF evidence of neurosyphilis, CDC guidelines recommend 7.2 million units of benzathine penicillin given in three weekly doses intramuscularly. CDC guidelines for neurosyphilis recommend aqueous crystalline penicillin G 2 to 4 million units intravenously every four hours for 10 to 14 days (total dose 12 - 24 million units). Alternative regimens include procaine penicillin 2 to 4 million units intramuscularly daily plus probenecid 500 mg intramuscularly four times daily for 10 to 14 days. Haas evaluated the sensitivity of treponemal tests as a marker of prior syphilis in individuals with HIV infection. The syphilis serology of 109 homosexual men with a documented history of treated syphilis was compared with records of prior results and confirmed on stored serum samples. None of the HIV-seronegative individuals lost reactivity to a treponemal test, whereas 7% of the seropositive asymptomatic individuals and 38% of those with symptomatic HIV infection had loss of reactivity. Symptomatic HIV infection was associated with loss of reactivity, as was a CD4 count below 200, a CD4-to-CD8 ratio below 0.6, a single prior episode of syphilis and a low VDRL titer at the time of the last documented episode of syphilis. Although no conclusions can be drawn about the sensitivity of treponemal tests in patients with active syphilis and HIV infection, these data suggest that treponemal tests may not identify those previously infected with Treponema pallidum. Rompalo reported that of 4863 STD had serological evidence of syphilis and 4.9% had HIV infection. Forty patients (0.8% of the total; 1 1% of those with reactive plasma reagin tests) had biological false-positive (BFP) serological tests for syphilis. There were no differences between true syphilis and BFP patients as to sex, age or i.v. drug use. BFP RPR tests were seen in 6 (4%) of 159 HIV-seropositive patients and 34 (0.8%) of 4387 HIV-seronegative patients. [Page 277](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/283?q1=directories) Hutchinson reported on 108 people with primary syphilis, 116 with secondary syphilis and 85 with early latent syphilis, 23% of whom were also HIV-positive. 53% of HIV-positive people presented with secondary syphilis, versus 33% of HIV-negative people. Among those with first episodes of syphilis, 43% of people with HIV who had secondary syphilis presented with persistent chancres, versus 15% of the HIV-negative group. Response to treatment did not appear to differ by HIV status. Gourevitch conducted a cohort study of 50 intravenous drug users with syphilis. 31/50 were HIV-positive and 19/50 were HIV-negative. HIV infection did not alter the response to treatment. Most patients had late latent syphilis at presentation (15/31 and 13/19 patients in the HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups, respectively). Follow-up was adequate to assess treatment outcomes in 43 patients (26 HIV-positive and 17 HIV-negative). A variety of treatment regimens were used. Among the evaluable HIV-positive patients, 12 received the standard CDC-recommended regimen of penicillin and 14 received other therapy (either high doses of penicillin or non-penicillin regimens). All responded adequately to therapy. Among the HIV-negative subjects, 9 received standard therapy and 8 received other therapy. One patient (who received wo weeks of tetracycline) did not respond adequately. Dowell retrqspectively compared ceftriaxone (1-2 g/day for 10-14 days) and benzathine penicillin (2.4 million units weekly for three weeks) for late latent syphilis or symptomatic neurosyphilis in HIV-infected patients. 28/44 ceftriaxone recipients and 8/13 benzathine-penicillin recipients responded to treatment. The investigators concluded that ceftriaxone and benzathine penicillin appear equivalent for patients with normal CSF. Trials are underway comparing IV ceftriaxone and IV penicillin G for neurosyphilis, and alternate penicillin regimens for syphilis. References Berry CD et al.

Platelets are small cells which are involved in clotting blood after injury. They are quite different from the blood proteins which are missing in haemophilia, which also cause clotting problems. Platelets are made in the bone marrow from other cells called megakaryocytes. In HIV infection platelets can be missing from the blood for several reasons. Bone marrow cells may produce fewer platelets either because they are directly infected by HIV or inhibited by abnormal immune responses, such as high levels of the cytokines tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and tumour growth factor beta (TGF-beta), or the development of antibodies against platelets. They may also be being removed from the blood. Low platelet counts occur in about 20% of people with HIV, at all stages of infection. Some treatment drugs, such as AZT and co-trimoxazole, car also cause thrombocytopenia. Symptoms and diagnosis The first symptoms may be easy bruising in the skin - the technical word for this is purpura. More severe loss of platelets causes bleeding internally; affected people may cough up blood or pass blood in their motions. The most severe complication is bleeding into the brain. These problems are all much more severe for people with haemophilia, who already have an underlying bleeding defect. A blood test will confirm that the platelet count is low and, unless the cause is obvious, a bone marrow biopsy may be required to see if this is due to poor production or loss from the blood. Treatment Treatment depends on the cause of the thrombocytopenia. Some cases may be caused directly by HIV itself - HIV can infect megakaryocytes which have the CD4 molecule on their surface, thus impairing platelet production. TNF - a cytokine which is produced in HIV infection - can also prevent platelet production. The best treatment for these conditions is AZT, which improves platelet production. Platelet production by the bone marrow is also very frequently impaired by drugs. Ganciclovir, interferon and cytotoxic chemotherapy very often do this, especially when they are used in combination. The best treatment in these cases is to try and change the drugs to ones that have less bone marrow side-effects. When the immune system is out of control, it may damage platelets by making antibodies against them or mopping them up with excess antibodies in the blood. The damaged platelets are removed from the blood by the spleen. When this happens in other immune diseases, it is possible to remove the spleen or to give steroids. Both of these could be dangerous in HIV infection as they can further damage the immune system. Intravenous immunoglobulin has been shown to help this problem, as has dapsone. Both of these probably modify the immune response against platelets. About 10-20% of people with thrombocytopenia recover without any treatment. Research Ballem reported that both platelet survival and in particular platelet production are decreased in HIV-related thrombocytopenia. This finding, together with the in vitro result that HIV can infect megakaryocytes, suggest A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 277 [Page 278](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/284?q1=directories) that HIV infection of megakaryocytes may be a direct cause of thrombocytopenia. Several groups (Hynes; Swiss Group for Clinical Studies on AIDS; Jackson) have reported that AZT can rapidly increase platelet counts in patients with HIV-related thrombocytopenia. This increase generally occurs within several weeks of initiating treatment, and is not sustained after treatment cessation. Rarick treated 14 adults with HIV-related thrombocytopenia with IVIG (1 g/kg on days 1, 2 and 15). The median platelet count increased from 17,000 at baseline to a maximum of 220,000. All patients had responded by day eight, but the effect was transient, with the median platelet count declining to 40,000 by day 15. The investigators suggested that IVIG may be used in patients with HIV-related thrombocytopenia who required an immediate increase in platelet count. HIV-related thrombocytopenia has also been reported to respond to dapsone, oral steroids, splenectomy and intravenous vincristine. Kemeny reported the results of a retrospective chart review of 22 HIV-infected patients who underwent splenectomy. The patients were classified as having ITP (n = 13) or a splenic infiltrative process (MAI, KS, or lymphoma, n = 9). The investigators defined a complete response to the surgery to be a platelet count above 150,000 one month post-operatively. Complete responses were observed in 11/13 patients with ITP and 6/9 with splenic infiltrative processes. References Ballem PJ et al.

It is quite common in the UK: about half the population have been exposed to it. It is transmitted by eating raw or undercooked meat; although it can also be present in cat's faeces, there is no evidence that cat-owners are at greater risk than anyone else. Toxoplasma gondii exists in three forms. Tachyzoites are immature larvae which infect nucleated cells and multiply, causing cell death and the progressive destruction of tissue. Trophyzoites are not responsible for transmission of infection. Cysts contain several thousand slowly growing tachyzoites. They can develop in any tissue but are particularly common in the central nervous system and muscle. In people with HIV, these cysts can be reactivated, releasing the organisms into the body. Undercooked meat can contain cysts filled with infectious organisms and can lead to transmission. Oocytes are formed by the sexual reproduction of the organisms in the intestinal mucosa of cats. Once outside the cat's body - usually in its faeces - these oocytes become infectious after 1 to 21 days. Symptoms Toxoplasma can cause illness in people with perfectly healthy immune systems, such as birth defects in some babies in the uterus, and a glandular fever-like illness in adults. In people with HIV with CD4 counts below 200, toxoplasmosis most commonly causes abscesses in the brain (cerebral toxoplasmosis). By exerting pressure on normal brain tissue these at first cause headache, fever, lethargy and confusion, progressing to fits, strokes (a weakness on one side of the body), changes in thinking and personality and difficulty speaking. Without treatment, as the abscesses grow bigger they can cause coma and eventually death. However, a number of other problems in HIV can produce similar symptoms; for more information on these, see the entries on CMV, lymphoma, HIV encephalopathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and tuberculosis. Rarely, T. gondii can cause problems in the lungs (toxoplasmic pneumonia), retina, heart, pancreas, liver, colon and/or testicles. Diagnosis After infection with T. gondii the body makes antibodies to it which can usually - but not always - be detected by a blood test. A positive test result means that you have been exposed to T. gondii at some point, but does not necessarily mean that you have toxoplasmosis now. Other tests can detect the organisms themselves, but these can be elusive and, again, their presence does not necessarily mean that they are causing active disease. A brain scan will show the typical abscesses, but again this does not definitely confirm toxoplasmosis, since a lymphoma and some other conditions would look the same. [Page 279](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/285?q1=directories) If the blood and brain scan tests suggest that the problem may be toxoplasmosis, most doctors will start toxoplasmosis treatment. The symptoms should improve within 14 days and a brain scan should show that the lesions have improved within 3 weeks. If these improvements are not seen after 7-10 days, most doctors will consider doing a brain biopsy (taking a sample of brain tissue to test) to find out definitively if toxoplasmosis is present. This is a difficult decision, since the procedure involves some risk, and must be discussed carefully and fully with your doctor. Treatment Toxoplasmosis usually responds well to treatment. Good recovery is the general rule. A number of treatment options exist, which will depend on local experience, any adverse reactions to drugs and whether you're taking AZT or not. The mainstay of initial treatment is either a combination of pyrimethamine plus sulphadiazine or dapsone plus sulphadiazine. The sulphadiazine component is often given intravenously in severe disease. It is also this component that can cause allergic reactions and blood problems in 20%-40% of people. In this case, there may be a need to replace the sulphadiazine with clindamycin. Clindamycin is given at a dose of 600 mg every 6 hours, either as tablets or intravenously; it has fewer side-effects, but diarrhoea can sometimes be a problem. After a few weeks on this therapy, and once a brain scan has shown improvement, it is necessary to switch to maintenance therapy which could be a low dose of clindamycin, pyrimethamine plus sulphadiazine or dapsone plus pyrimethamine. These have the added advantage of providing some prophylaxis against PCP. Maintenance therapy on one of these options has to be continued for life because the relapse rate would be very high without it. In cases of very severe toxoplasmosis or when there is a lot of swelling around the abscesses on the brain scan, steroids such as dexamethasone may be given by injection or tablets, together with prophylactic drugs against fits. Atovaquone has shown promising early results. In tests with rats it was actually able to kill the cysts and trophozoite forms of Toxoplasma, rather than merely suppressing them; this effect has not been seen in humans with the current formulation of atovaquone. The drug has been used successfully to treat toxoplasmosis in people who are unable to tolerate the standard treatments, and is available on a named patient basis from its manufacturer, Wellcome, for this use. The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin has also been tested as a treatment for toxoplasmosis. Trial results to date have been unimpressive. Azithromycin is available on a compassionate use basis in the USA and on a named patient basis in the UK for the treatment of toxoplasmosis. The related drug clarithromycin is also active against Toxoplasma and appears to be an effective treatment in combination with pyrimethamine in the short-term, but with frequent side-effects. Other experimental approaches include the addition of the cytokine gamma interferon to anti-toxoplasmosis treatment, as in test-tube studies it inhibits Toxoplasma and prevents death in animals with toxoplasmosis, as well as being synergistic with anti-microbial drugs. There have been a few case reports of the successful use of the antibiotic doxycycline to treat toxoplasmosis in people who had failed to respond to standaad therapies. Interleukin-2 has also been shown to improve the survival of animals with toxoplasmosis. Prophylaxis Prophylaxis means preventing an infection from happening. Maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of toxoplasmosis after an active infection has been treated (see above) is a form of secondary prophylaxis. However, before any active infection occurs, tests can show whether a person is latently infected with T. gondii, and therefore at risk of developing active toxoplasmosis if the CD4 cell count falls below approximately 150. There is mounting evidence that it is also possible to prevent a first occurrence of toxoplasmosis by routine prophylaxis for people with CD4 counts less than 200 - this is known as primary prophylaxis. Dapsone/pyrimethamine and co-trimoxazole both appear to be effective; since co-trimoxazole started to be widely used for PCP prophylaxis, toxoplasmosis has also become very much less common. However, aerosolised pentamidine as PCP prophylaxis provides no protection against other infections as it only reaches the lungs. As with PCP prophylaxis, the obvious benefits of prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis have to be weighed against the very real possibility of side-effects from the drugs. Experimental regimens for toxoplasmosis prophylaxis include azithromycin clarithromycin. Pyrimethamine is not recommended for toxoplasmosis prophylaxis. One study showed that it does not prevent the disease, while another found that pyrimethamine recipients had increased mortality compared with those given an inactive placebo. Key research Wallace found that Toxoplasma IgG antibody positivity did not correlate with cat ownership. Porter and Sande report that the absence of detectable antitoxoplasma IgG antibodies does not exclude the diagnosis. In their retrospectively reviewed series, 4/18 patients with pathologically proved toxoplasmosis did not have detectable antitoxoplasma antibodies. Pugin reported that elevated serum lactic may differentiate disseminated toxoplasmic pneumonitis from PCP. Key research on treatment Leport (1988) reviewed the records of 35 people with AIDS and CNS toxoplasmosis treated with pyrimethamine plus sulphadiazine. The mean duration of therapy was 6 months and some patients were evaluated for long-term therapy. Although a 2- to 4-fold higher initial dose of pyrimethamine was used than usual (namely 50-100 mg/day) only 2 patients showed haematological toxicity requiring the drug to be discontinued. Long-term therapy gave an overall success rate of 58% whereas earlier, at 2 months, only 29% of patients had their infection resolved. For long-term therapy the use of 25-50 mg/day of pyrimethamine together with 2-3 g/day sulphadiazine is Heald reported on the effectiveness of pyrimethamine plus sulphadiazine for toxoplasmosis treatment as prophylaxis against PCP in patients with AIDS. 6 of 99 patients (6%) treated for toxoplasmosis developed PCP, a prophylactic effect comparable to that seen in 1 14 patients receiving nebulised pentamidine, of whom 8 developed PCP (6%). Of the 6 patients receiving toxoplasmosis treatment who developed PCP, 5 were on treatment regimes other than pyrimethamine with sulphadiazine. Tenant-Flowers enrolled 16 AIDS patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis and known allergies to sulphonamides in a sulphadiazine dose de-sensitisation protocol. Patients received pyrimethamine 25 mg twice a day and folinic acid 7.5 mg/day. 8 patients received concomitant steroids. Sulphadiazine was administered every 3 hours over 5 days in doses gradually escalating from 10 g. Success, defined as tolerance of sulphadiazine 2-4 g/day, was achieved in 10/16 patients. Dannemann conducted a randomised, unblinded phase II trial in which 59 evaluable AIDS patients with presumptive toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) were A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 279 [Page 280](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/286?q1=directories) treated with pyrimethamine (loading dose 200 mg followed by 75 mg/day) and folinic acid (10 mg/day) plus either clindamycin (1200 mg intravenously every six hours for 3 weeks, then 300 mg every 6 hours or 450 mg every 8 hours, orally, for 3 weeks) or sulphadiazine (100 mg/kg/day up to 8 g/day given 4 times per day for 6 weeks). After three weeks, 20/26 (77%) of patients randomized to PC and 26/33 (79%) of patients randomized to PS had a complete or partial clinical response.After 6 weeks of therapy, the rate of partial or complete clinical response in the PS group was 70% (23 patients) compared to 65% (17 patients) of the PC group. No patient on either regimen who exhibited a complete response after three weeks had deteriorated at six weeks. PS showed enhanced efficacy based on some parameters. While most study deaths were not directly related to TE, there was a non-significant trend toward greater survival in patients randomised to PS; in those who tolerated PS therapy, survival was 100% compared to 74% in those who tolerated PC therapy. Crossover therapy because of toxicity occurred in 6 of the PC group and 11 in the PS group; skin rash was the most common adverse reaction. Patients randomised to pyrimethamine plus clindamycin (PC) were more likely to achieve complete clinical and radiologic responses. Similar efficacy of the treatments was suggested by a hazard analysis of abnormal mental status, fever and headache. The results of the study support the use of PC as an acceptable alternative in those unable to tolerate PS. Katlama (1992) compared the combination of pyrimethamine (50 mg/day) and clindamycin (2.4 g/day) (P/C) to (50 mg/day) and g/day) (P/S) in AIDS patients with first-episode toxoplasmic encephalitis. 342 patients were randomly assigned to receive open-label P/C (n = 175) or P/S (n = 167) for six weeks. In the P/C group, 47% had a complete response, 21% had a partial response, and 18% died during acute therapy. In the P/S group, 55% had a complete response, 22% had a partial response, and 14% died during acute therapy. These differences were not statistically significant. DeWit reported that significantly more patients had to discontinue therapy due to side effects in the pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine compared with the pyrimethamine/clindamycin group (44 v. 17). Skin rash and fever occurred in more patients in the pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine group (58 v. 44, while diarrhoea occurred in more patients on pyrimethamine/clindamycin (29 v. 8). Moore reported that the regime of pyrimethamine-clindamycin (PC) may provide a small survival benefit over pyrimethamine plus sulphadiazine (PS). In a longitudinal natural history study of 55 patients, median survival was 280 days vs 260 days respectively. Patients who switched from PS to PC due to adverse events survived a median of 360 days. Luft treated 49 people with AIDS and toxoplasmic encephalitis with clindamycin (600 mg four times a day) plus pyrimethamine (75 mg every day) for 6 weeks. 35/49 (71%) responded, of whom 30 (86%) had improvement by day 7. 32 responders (91%) improved with respect to at least half of their base-line abnormalities by day 14. Early neurological deterioration despite treatment or failure to improve neurologically after 10 - 14 days of treatment were associated with treatment failure. 8 patients had dose-limiting toxic effects - 7 rashes and 1 neutropenia. Fernandez-Martin enrolled 13 patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis; after 6 weeks treatment with pyrimethamine (200 mg by mouth for 1 week; then 75 mg by mouth) plus clarithromycin (1000 mg by mouth twice a day) plus folinic acid (20 mg by mouth every day), clinical response was 80%. Nearly all participants reported adverse reactions, but they were often minor although severe haematological abnormalities occurred in 31%. Remington and Vilde reported the recommendations from an expert panel convened in summer 1991 to discuss clindamycin treatment for Toxoplasma encephalitis when sulphadiazine cannot be tolerated. For induction therapy the panel recommends 100-200 mg loading dose of pyrimethamine followed by 50-75 mg/day plus 600 mg clindamycin orally or intravenously every 6 hours (2400 mg/day) for at least 3 weeks. Folinic acid was also suggested during induction therapy. The duration of induction therapy depends on the clinical response; severely ill patients may require 4-6 weeks. Data was inadequate for the panel to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy; however, if clindamycin is used for maintenance, a dose of at least 1 200 mg/day in combination with pyrimethamine is recommended. Using clindamycin for prophylaxis is not recommended because of the high rates of adverse reactions. Leport (1990) studied 13 AIDS patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis; after 3 weeks' treatment with pyrimethamine (200 mg by mouth for 1 week; then 75 mg by mouth) plus clarithromycin (1000 mg by mouth twice daily) plus folinic acid (20 mg by mouth daily), complete clinical remission was seen in 6/13. Side-effects noted include anaemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, elevated liver function tests, rash and hypoacusis. Atovaquone is currently in Phase II/Ill study in centres across the USA and Canada, and in Paris and Belgium, as a salvage treatment for patients who are intolerant to or who have failed on conventional therapy for cerebral toxoplasmosis. It is also available on a named patient basis as salvage therapy. Araujo and Huskinson-Mark reported that rodent studies of atovaquone demonstrated a cidal effect on Toxoplasma organisms and cysts; this effect has not been reproduced in humans. Clumeck enrolled 32 AIDS patients with toxoplasmosis in a pilot study of atovaquone. Patients received atovaquone (750 mg four times daily) for 6 weeks. 26/32 were evaluable (patients were excluded if they did not have toxoplasmosis, had concomitant 01, or were non-compliant). At day fourteen, 12 patients had a complete and 10 had a partial clinical response; 3 had a complete and 17 had a partial radiologic response. Adverse reactions included elevated LFTs (13 patients), rash (6), and GI disturbances (3). Kovacs enrolled eight patients with AIDS and biopsy-documented toxoplama encephalitis or with a compatible CT or MRI scan who could no longer tolerate or who had failed conventional therapy in a study of atovaquone at a dose of 750 mg four times a day for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks responders received chronic suppressive therapy with atovaquone at the same dose. During the treatment phase seven showed partial radiological improvement and the eighth was stable. Six improved substantially clinically, one remained stable and one developed progressive HIV-related dementia and died after 6 weeks with no signs of toxoplasmosis post mortem. 1/8 developed a rash and conjunctivitis but was successfully re-challenged; transient conjunctivitis occurred during the first week of rechallenge and erythema multiforme necessitating drug cessation occurred ten weeks later. Five of the seven entering chronic suppressive therapy continued to show both radiographic and clinical responses for the rest of their lives (16 - 60 weeks after enrolment). The authors conclude that atovaquone is a well-tolerated, effective therapy for patients with Toxoplasma encephalitis who are intolerant of conventional therapies. Torres (1993a) treated 93 AIDS patients with toxoplasmosis with atovaquone (750 mg four times a day) as salvage treatment. Response to treatment and median survival were correlated with the plasma concentration of atovaquone. After six weeks of therapy, clinical improvement or stability was noted in 22/25 (88%), 15/24 (63%), and 7/13 (54%) of patients with atovaquone plasma concentrations above 13 g/ml, between 7 and 13 g/ml, and below 7 g/ml, respectively. Median survival was 426, 424, and 116 days for patients with atovaquone plasma concentrations above 13 g/ml, between 7 and 13 g/ml and below 7 g/ml, respectively. Kovacs enrolled patients with toxoplasmosis who were unable to tolerate pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine in one of two studies: (1) treatment with azithromycin (1200 mg/day) (2 patients) or (2) treatment with atovaquone (750 mg four times daily) plus pyrimethamine (50 mg/day) (4 patients). Patients with stable or improved disease, as evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were continued on therapy indefinitely. Both patients treated with azithromycin as a single agent showed radiographic evidence of progression by two weeks and were removed from the study. Azithromycin was well tolerated. Of the four patients treated with atovaquone/pyrimethamine, two had previously failed therapy with atovaquone alone; both responded to combination therapy. One of the latter patients died at 6 weeks from progressive Kaposi sarcoma; the other has shown a sustained response for greater than 30 weeks. The third patient progressed after 3 weeks and was removed from the study. The fourth patient has received less than 6 weeks of therapy. One patient developed severe neutropenia while on atovaquone/pyrimethamine, requiring G-CSFtherapy; the combination was otherwise well tolerated. Saba enrolled 14 AIDS patients in an open-label study of azithromycin (1000 mg loading dose then 500 mg/day) plus pyrimethamine (200 mg loading dose then 75 mg/day) for acute therapy of Toxoplasma encephalitis. 8/14 patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis were treated for more than 21 days and were evaluated for efficacy; 5/8 had a favorable clinical response (a favourable response was defined as 50% improvement.) Nine patients were evaluable for a radiologic response; 6/9 had favorable responses. Toxicities included rash (n = 5), abnormal liver function (n = 2), vomiting (n = 3) and hypoacusia (n = 1). Godofsky described a patient intolerant to sulpur drugs who developed a rash while receiving clindamycin/pyrimethamine/folinic acid. The patient was switched to azithromycin 1000 mg daily (after a 1500 mg loading dose); cerebellar lesions had almost completely resolved by six weeks, and significant clinical improvement was observed. 41 patients (out of an anticipated 45) have enrolled in ACTG 156, a phase 1/11 dose-escalation trial of the combination of pyrimethamine and azithromycin for toxoplasmic encephalitis. Although the optimal dosages of drugs have not been determined, azithromycin when used alone has been associated with early relapse. In the USA, azithromycin is available on a compassionate-use basis for patients who have failed or are intolerant of pyrimethamine, sulphadiazine, or clindamycin; in the UK it is available on a named patient basis. Canessa treated 25 patients with toxoplasmosis with co-trimoxazole 40-50 mg/kg intravenously every day. Radiological and clinical improvements were seen in 18/25 patients. Mean survival time for responders was 8.8 months vs 2.1 months for non-responders. Stellini (1992) treated 37 AIDS patients with toxoplasmic encephalitis co-trimoxazole (40-50 mg/kg intravenous and/or 4-6 weeks). 33/37 responded to treatment (89.2%). 4 did not respond (3 had 280 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS [Page 281](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/287?q1=directories) no radiological improvement, 1 died after 4 weeks). Rashes requiring drug discontinuation occurred in seven patients. Masur reported the results of a small open-label study suggesting that trimetrexate is not adequate as a single-agent therapy for toxoplasmosis. 9 sulphonamide-intolerant AIDS patients with toxoplasmosis received trimetrexate intravenously at doses ranging from 30 - 280 mg/m daily with leucovorin (20 mg/m intravenously or orally every 6 hours). Partial clinical and/or radiologic responses were observed in 8/9 patients; however, these responses were transient, and all eight patients deteriorated within 13 - 109 days of their initial responses. Trimetrexate was well tolerated in this group. Bockmon treated seven patients with either doxycycline (4 mg/kg/day), minocycline (4 mg/kg/day), or minocycline (4 mg/kg/day) in combination with pyrimethamine. All patients responded to therapy. Indorf reported the successful use of doxycyline (100 mg every 12 hours) in a man with toxoplasmosis who did not respond to standard therapy. Lacassin reported the salvage treatment of toxoplasmosis with clarithromycin (0.75 - 2 g/day) plus minocyclin (200 mg/day) in 8 patients with toxoplasmosis who had previous treatment limiting adverse events to alternative treatments. Of 6 receiving acute therapy, 2 had partial responses and 4 had complete responses. Treatment limiting hepatitis occurred in 1 participant. During maintenance therapy (clarithromycin 1.5 g/day plus minocyclin 100-200 mg/day) relapse occurred in 1 non-compliant patient and 1 patient died after 7.5 months with neurological manifestations attributed to a stroke. No treatment limiting adverse events were noted. Research on maintenance Katlama (1994) reported that in the ENTA 04 study comparing pyrimethamine-sulphadiazine (PS) with pyrimethamine-clindamycin (PC) (see above), 17/83 (20%) participants receiving PS maintenance experienced relapse of Toxoplasma encephalitis, compared with 39/92 (42%) in the PC arm. 23% of people in each arm experienced adverse events. Mouthon described the open-label use of atovaquone (750 mg four times daily) as a maintenance therapy for patients who have recovered from acute toxoplasmosis. 22 patients were included in the study; 12/22 had received atovaquone as therapy for acute toxoplasmosis, while the other 10 had received other therapies. Relapses occurred in 5/22 patients. All five relapses occurred in patients who had received atovaquone for acute therapy. No side effects requiring drug discontinuation occurred. Research on prophylaxis Jacobson (1994) reported that in a double-blind randomised study among people with CD4 counts below 200 who were seropositive for Toxoplasma, pyrimethamine (25 mg three times weekly) was associated with increased mortality compared with no prophylaxis (relative risk 2.5). Only 1 of 218 participants taking co-trimoxazole but 7 of 117 taking aerosolized pentamidine for developed randomised double-blind study comparing pyrimethamine (25 mg three times weekly) and placebo in 554 people seropositive for Toxoplasma. After a mean follow-up of 14 months, no difference in the incidence of toxoplasmosis was observed between the groups by intention-to-treat analysis (12% vs 13%). Survival was also similar at 85% in the pyrimethamine group and 80% in the placebo arm. 20% of pyrimethamine recipients discontinued treatment due to adverse events, compared with 8% of placebo recipients. By on-treatment analysis, the incidence of toxoplasmosis among people who could tolerate pyrimethamine was significantly lower (4%) than in the placebo group (12%). Jacobson (1992) enrolled 164 HIV-infected patients at risk of toxoplasmic encephalitis in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing clindamycin and pyrimethamine as prophylaxis. Interim analysis showed that clindamycin-treated patients were 4.4 times more likely to experience an adverse effect that necessitated withdrawal of the study drug than those who received placebo. Diarrhoea and rash were reported in 16 (31%) and 11 (21%), respectively, of 52 patients treated with clindamycin (300 mg twice daily) compared with 2 (6%) and none of the 32 placebo-treated patients. The clindamycin arm of the trial was prematurely terminated, although recruitment to the pyrimethamine arm continues. Girard compared aerosol pentamidine prophylaxis for both toxoplasmosis and PCP. 75% of patients were positive for T. gondii antibodies at baseline, and the mean entry CD4 count was 115. Toxoplasmosis developed in 32/176 and 19/173 of patients receiving aerosol pentamidine and apsone/pyrimethamine respectively. Patients assigned to aerosol pentamidine had a significantly higher risk of developing toxoplasmosis compared to dapsone/pynmethamine recipients (relative risk 1.81). Survival was statistically equivalent (41 and 45 deaths in the aerosol pentamidine and dapsone/pyrimethamine groups, respectively). Significantly more patients in the dapsone/pyrimethamine group than in the aerosolized pentamidine group discontinued treatment due to toxicity (42 vs. 3). Most frequent toxicities were cutaneous and haematological. Opravil presented interim results from an ongoing multi-center Swiss comparing aerosol pentamidine (300 HIV-infected patients with either symptoms or a CD4 count below 200 have enrolled; 47% are positive for T. gondii antibodies. After a median follow-up of more than a year, 14/291 (4.8%) patients receiving dapsone/pyrimethamine and 20/242 (8.26%) pentamidine have developed toxoplasmosis. Intolerance to dapsone/pyrimethamine occurred significantly more frequently than to aerosol pentamidine. Stellini (1994) reported on an ongoing randomized study comparing co-trimoxazole (one double-strength tablet every other day) with pyrimethamine (50 mg twice weekly). (Patients randomized to pyrimethamine also receive aerosol pentamidine 300 mg monthly.) 49 patients with CD4 counts below 200 with T. gondii antibodies have been randomized. An interim analysis after a mean follow-up of 20 months showed that toxoplasmosis had developed in 1 and 7 patients in the co-trimoxazole and pyrimethamine groups respectively (P = 0.03), and PCP developed in 0 and 2 patients (NS). Adverse reactions were observed in 7 and 4 patients (NS). Tournerie reported on the occurrence of toxoplasmosis among participants in the MRC/INSERM Alpha trial of ddl. Of 499 French participants who had never experienced toxoplasmosis, 80 received co-trimoxazole and 419 received mainly aerosolised pentamidine (AP) for PCP prophylaxis. A first episode of toxoplasmosis occurred in 1/80 and 49/419 participants receiving co-trimoxazole and AP respectively. 9/80 co-trimoxazole recipients stopped drug due to toxicity. Lipman conducted a chart review of all patients who had received co-trimoxazole or aerosol pentamidine as prophylaxis for PCP. developed toxoplasmosis. Podzamczer (1994) evaluated the efficacy of co-trimoxazole in preventing toxoplasmic encephalitis in 52 HIV-positive people prospectively followed between 1988 and 1994. Median follow-up was 25 months. 7 patients stopped therapy, 5 due to adverse events. On an intention-to-treat basis, cumulative rate of toxoplasmosis at 12 months was 6% and at 36% was 9%. Carr conducted a retrospective study of low-dose co-trimoxazole as prophylaxis for toxoplasmic encephalitis. During a three-year study period after primary episodes of PCP, 60 patients (who could tolerate sulphonamides) received co-trimoxazole and 95 patients received pentamidine (aerosolised in 78 patients and intravenous in 17) as secondary prophylaxis. No patient in the co-trimoxazole group and no patient seronegative for T.gondii developed toxoplasmic encephalitis, compared with 12/36 (33%) patients positive for T.gondii in the pentamidine group. A significant difference was seen in the time to development of toxoplasmic encephalitis between the co-trimoxazole group (no case at 1153 days) and the pentamidine group (median time, 460 days). Neither the CD4 count at the start of prophylaxis nor AZT therapy during the period of prophylaxis influenced the rate of toxoplasmic encephalitis in any group. Podzamczer (1993) compared the efficacy and safety of primary prophylaxis against PCP and toxoplasmosis with either co-trimoxazole (1 double-strength tablet three times per week) or dapsone plus pyrimethamine (100 mg plus 25mg weekly) among 166 people with CD4 counts below 200. After a mean follow-up of 380 days, those receiving dapsone-pyrimethamine had a higher rate of PCP (15.2% vs 3.7%). Both regimes seemed equally effective in preventing toxoplasmosis (2.4% co-trimoxazole, 3.5% dapsone-pyrimethamine) Adverse 42.4% of dapsone-pyrimethamine recipients), but only 12.3% of co-trimoxazole and 2.3% of dapsone-pyrimethamine had to discontinue therapy because of toxicity. Reynes enrolled 134 patients with AIDS or ARC and CD4 counts below 200 in a prospective open trial comparing co-trimoxazole (160 mg/800 mg twice a day) with aerosolised pentamidine for primary prophylaxis of PCP and toxoplasmosis. No PCP or toxoplasmosis occurred in 76 participants who received co-trimoxazole for a mean of 14 months per patient; 34 patients (44%) needed half-dose reduction of co-trimoxazole due to cytopenia. 2 cases of PCP and 11 cases of toxoplasmosis occurred in 58 patients receiving AP for a mean of 14.8 months. Clotet conducted a prospective study on 109 HIV-positive patients (58 with AIDS) to evaluate the use of dapsone (100 mg twice weekly) and pyrimethamine (25 mg twice weekly) as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis. Mean follow up was 15 months. One patient (5%) receiving secondary prophylaxis for PCP and 1 patient (2.6%) in the group on primary prophylaxis had an episode of PCP. Primary toxoplasmosis did not occur in any of 54 patients who had Toxoplasma antibodies at the start of the study. Torres (1 993b) conducted a randomized comparison of dapsone (100 mg twice weekly) and aerosolized pentamidine (100 mg every two weeks) for the prevention of toxoplasmosis and PCP. 278 patients with AIDS or ARC and CD4 counts below 250 were randomized. The mean follow-up time A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 281 [Page 282](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/288?q1=directories) was 42 and 44 weeks in the dapsone and aerosol pentamidine groups, respectively, Significantly fewer cases of toxoplasmosis occurred in the dapsone group (0 vs.6). The NIAID Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA) compared clindamycin (300 mg twice daily), pyrimethamine (25 mg three times weekly) and placebo as primary prophylaxis for toxoplasmosis. The clindamycin arm was terminated early due to excessive treatment-limiting toxicity (diarrhoea and rash). According to Wellcome, the manufacturer of pyrimethamine, the trial was terminated after an interim analysis revealed a significantly higher death rate among pyrimethamine recipients (46/264, or 27.8/100 person years) compared with placebo recipients (13/132, or 13.6/100 person years). Bachmeyer enrolled 44 patients with CD4 below 100 and detectable antitoxoplasma antibodies in a study of pyrimethamine (50 mg/day by mouth) and Folinic acid (50 mg by mouth twice weekly) as primary prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis. Of 26 treated at full dosage for a median of 10 months, none developed toxoplasmosis. Treatment was discontinued in 18 patients because of drug toxicity; 8 developed toxoplasmosis. In a matched historical control group, 21/44 (48%) developed cerebral toxoplasmosis. Maslo conducted a retrospective study of pyrimethamine (100, 75, 50 mg/day according to tolerance) as maintenance therapy for 51 patients with brain toxoplasmosis. Of those receiving 100 mg/day for a median of 9.7 months, 2 relapsed (6%) at months 5 and 6. Of those receiving 75 mg/day, for 8.3 months, 0 relapsed. At 50 mg/day for 8.5 months, 2 (14%) relapsed at months 4 and 1 1. No patient had treatment interrupted due to toxicity. Of the 4 patients experiencing relapse, at least 3 were not compliant.

Cats and toxoplasmosis risk in HIV-infected adults. JAMA 269(1):76-77, 1993. * Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is illness caused by the mycobacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. Tb). Most exposure to tuberculosis occurs in childhood as a result of breathing in mycobacteria transmitted from infected, usually adult, individuals. Inhaled mycobacteria multiply at the site of infection in the lung and produce an inflamed area. M.Tb bacteria move to the lymph glands in the lungs which can enlarge. This is known as primary TB. The widespread use of BCG vaccination in Britain (though not the USA) means that very few people become infected during childhood. In a minority of individuals some mycobacteria can spread throughout the body leading to serious disease. In most cases, however, the body's immune defences cause the M.Tb organisms to be contained and walled off in a lesion within the lungs, where some of the mycobacteria persist and remain alive for years of even decades. A minority of people who develop this lesion but don't get immediately ill will go on to develop detectable disease during their lifetime. This is known as reactivation TB. Some will develop disease during the first few years after infection and others will develop it many years or decades later. If an individual's immune system is moderately impaired, M.Tb organisms can overcome the immune system's surveillance' and cause reactivation TB in the lungs. In addition, the immune system's 'memory' for BCG vaccination may be lost, and the individual once again becomes vulnerable to lung TB. It has been estimated that for people with HIV the risk of latent M.Tb infection being reactivated is between 2% and 10% per year. More widespread damage to the immune system can lead to disseminated TB. Alternatively, HIV-positive people who have never previously been exposed to M.Tb are at risk of developing primary TB as their defence mechanisms to combat infection are damaged. The AIDS epidemic has seen a marked increase in the number of cases in the USA and in developing countries. However, the successful TB control measures introduced in Britain since the 1950s mean that the organism is much less common, and only about 5% of people with AIDS in England and Wales develop TB. Symptoms and diagnosis The classic symptoms of tuberculosis in the lung (pulmonary TB) are cough, weight loss, fever, night sweats and fatigue. However, these symptoms can also have several alternative causes in people with HIV. In people with severe immune damage TB can spread (disseminate) from the lung. It can then occur in the lymph nodes, causing swelling and fever; the intestines, causing diarrhoea and fever; the liver, causing jaundice and fever; and the brain, causing meningitis with symptoms of confusion. Skin tests can show whether a person has been infected with M.Tb, but in people with HIV these can be unreliable. Chest X-rays of people with TB look very like those of people with PCP. The best way to diagnose tuberculosis is to see whether M.Tb can be grown from sample of fluid or tissue taken from the lungs using a fibre-optic bronchoscope. Treatment Treatment consists of taking a combination of drugs. This is because the M.Tb may become resistant to one or more drugs. It is also important to take treatments for TB diligently to minimise the chances of resistance developing. Possible drugs include isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, amikacin and ethambutol. Many doctors will start treatment with some of these drugs as soon as TB is suspected, and will then fine-tune the treatment when they have the results of tests showing which drugs the particular M.Tb organisms are most susceptible to. The drugs need to be taken for a long time, usually 9-18 months, because of the ability of M.Tb to lie dormant and hidden in macrophages in the lungs. Some doctors advocate staying on one TB pill forever, after a first episode of TB. Side-effects to all drugs may occur so it is important to have careful monitoring. An experimental drug, prothionamide, is available on a named patient basis. In the USA there have been several outbreaks of TB resistant to the drugs used to treat it. These strains have infected both people with HIV and HIV-negative health workers. The likelihood of dying from this form of TB is very high. As yet only one case of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) has been notified in the UK. Prophylaxis In the USA it is standard practice to treat HIV-positive people who have latent but inactive TB with isoniazid for at least one to two years, to try to keep the infection from becoming active. Treatment is also recommended to people who have recently been in close contact with someone with infectious tuberculosis. People who cannot tolerate isoniazid are usually treated with rifampin or rifampin plus pyrazinamide. There is some evidence that this treatment does reduce the risk of developing active TB. In Britain, it is not usual to offer prophylaxis against tuberculosis. Research HIV-infected people are particularly susceptible to infection by M. tuberculosis, and the course of the disease is accelerated. Daley investigated an outbreak of tuberculosis among residents of a housing facility for HIV-infected people. Among 30 residents exposed, active tuberculosis developed within four months in 11/30 (37%) and newly positive skin tests developed in 4/30 (13%). Jones reported that people with HIV are at increased risk of extra-pulmonary TB, especially at low CD4 counts. The CDC recommends that patients with susceptible M. tuberculosis should be treated with two months of INH, rifampin, and pyrazinamide followed by 4 to 7 months of INH and rifampin. In the case of active tuberculosis, the CDC has advised that HIV-positive patients receive at least 9-1 2 months of combination chemotherapy. Berning, Gordon and Peloquin reported that malabsorption of anti-mycobacterial drugs occurs relatively frequently in AIDS patients with TB. To prevent treatment failure, screening for drug malabsorption may be indicated. A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 283 [Page 284](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/290?q1=directories) Holt concluded that three-times-weekly therapy is equally effective in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with tuberculosis. 423 patients in Haiti were enrolled in the trial, 176 (42%) of whom were HIV-positive. Patients received isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol administered three times a week for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for four months. Improvement in symptoms and sputum conversion occurred equally frequently in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. Mortality was more frequent in the HIV-positive subjects (9% vs. 1%). Berenguer reported that while tuberculous meningitis occurs more frequently in HIV-infected people, clinical outcomes are similar to those in non-HIV-infected people. Multi-drug-resistant TB Several outbreaks of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among HIV-positive people in hospitals and prisons have been reported in the States recently. Mortality among these patients is very high (approximately 80%) and the disease progression is extremely rapid. Edlin and Fischl studied outbreaks of MDR-TB in hospitals. They report that nosocomial transmission of MDR-TB bacilli among HIV-infected patients can occur. They caution that acid-fast-bacilli isolation procedures must be strictly enforced in hospitals. Small reported that multi-drug resistance in HIV-infected people can result from re-infection with resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. This re-infection can occur during or after therapy for drug-sensitive tuberculosis. A new assay is in development which may accelerate the diagnosis of MDR-TB. Jacobs reported that inserting the light-producing luciferase gene into M. tuberculosis in culture allows for the rapid detection of resistant and susceptible strains after treatment with antituberculosis drugs. Most multi-drug resistant strains are resistant at least to isoniazid and rifampin. Guidelines drawn up by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that susceptibility testing be performed on the initial M. tuberculosis isolates from all patients with TB. Pending results of susceptibility testing, patients with suspected MDR-TB should receive a regimen containing isoniazid, rifampin and pyrazinamide plus ethambutol or streptomycin. Others have proposed an initial regime of five or six drugs, including at least two to which the organisms are likely to be susceptible based on local patterns of drug resistance. Mahmoudi and Iseman reported that inadequate treatment is the primary cause of the development of MDR-TB. Multiple levels of resistance are especially likely to accrete when single drugs are added to a failing regimen. Prophylaxis In the USA, where BCG vaccination is not routine, individuals with HIV and a positive skin test for or history of tuberculosis are recommended by the CDC to take preventive isoniazid therapy. Pape reported that isoliazid prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of active tuberculosis in PPD-positive HIV-infected people, from 7.5 to 2.2 cases per 100 person years. Wadhawan found that daily isoniazid (600mg) reduced the incidence of tuberculosis from 1 1.3 to 2.6 cases per 100 patients years of follow-up in a study using a vitamin B complex as the control. Primary prophylaxis against TB is not generally accepted practice in the UK. Horn described the use of ofloxacin (800 mg/day) with pyrazinamide (1500 mg/day) in 16 health-care workers exposed to MDR-TB. The health-care workers were not HIV-infected. 14/16 discontinued prophylaxis before the completion of six months of therapy because of side-effects (arthralgia, GI distress, and others).

SUlcers People with HIV may develop ulcers caused by infections such as herpes simplex virus or CMV at low CD4 counts. These ulcers need to be treated with drugs that attack the particular infection. Some treatment drugs may also cause ulcers. ddC has been implicated in oesophageal ulceration. People with HIV may also experience aphthous ulcers, which are painful lesions in the mouth and oesophagus (throat) that are not caused by an infection. These can make eating very painful, which sometimes causes loss of appetite and weight loss. Diagnosis Ulcers can be diagnosed by visual examination, using a fibre-optic endoscope to observe ulcers in the throat. Swabs may be taken to test whether other infections such as herpes or CMV can be isolated from the ulcer. Treatment Aphthous ulcers are usually treated with steroid ointments, which dampen down the inflammation and allow the body's natural healing processes to take place. However, topical steroid treatment (applied directly to the ulcer) is often only possible for ulcers in the mouth, and for ulcers in the oesophagus, systemic steroid therapy is needed (i.e. with tablets that affect the whole body), which can cause further immunosuppression in people with HIV. Researchers have reported some success using low dose steroids 284 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS [Page 285](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/291?q1=directories) attached to sucralfate, a substance that sticks specifically to inflamed tissue in the throat, thus targeting the treatment. Thalidomide (100 mg a day) has also been reported to be an effective treatment for ulcers. Thalidomide cannot be given to women because it can cause birth defects in the children of pregnant women. Prolonged use of thalidomide can also cause irreversible neuropathy - painful damage to the nerves in the hands and feet. Thalidomide is available in the UK on a named patient basis. Research Bach reported on the use of colchicine; Youle and Ryan reported successful treatment with thalidomide. Gnzler recommended that thalidomide should not be used in patients with peripheral neuropathy or neurological dysfunction. Eggimann randomly assigned 14 HIV-positive men with oral and/or oesophageal ulcers that did not respond to empiric treatment with fluconazole or acyclovir with either thalidomide (300 mg/day) or placebo. Mean duration of symptoms at baseline was 50 days. On initial blinded treatment, ulcers healed in 3/7 thalidomide recipients and 0/7 placebo recipients. On further open treatment, 5/7 participants who failed on initial treatment with placebo were successfully treated with thalidomide (300 mg/day) and one was successfully cured with 600 mg/day. 3/4 who failed on 300 mg/day were cured by further treatment with 600 mg/day. Overall success was 0/7 on placebo, 8/14 on mg/day) and 4/5 on thalidomide (600 mg/day). Relapse occurred in 9 participants after a median of 77 days and 4 discontinued thalidomide due to allergy. Wilcox reported resolution of symptoms in 11/12 patients with oesophageal ulcers on treatment with prednisone (40 mg/day tapering to 10 mg/week) for one month. Sokol-Anderson treated four HIV-positive patients with dexamethasone (0.5 mg) combined with sucralfate (1 g) four times daily. All four responded rapidly to therapy, allowing tapering of dosage.

Herpes zoster virus is quite common in the population. Many people become infected with it as children, when it causes mild chickenpox. People who are infected while adults often have more serious primary disease. Once you are infected the virus stays in the nerve cells near the base of the spine. Most of the time it is dormant and causes no symptoms, but from time to time it can reactivate, causing shingles. Among people with HIV, attacks of shingles often take place before an AIDS-defining illness has occurred. People with HIV who have not had chickenpox are well advised to stay away from children with chickenpox to avoid becoming infected; conversely, a person with shingles is able to infect a child or someone else who has not had chickenpox. There is some evidence that herpes viruses can act as a co-factor in AIDS, activating HIV and making it easier for HIV to infect certain cells. However, studies have suggested that people with HIV who have shingles are at no greater risk of disease progression than people with the same CD4 count who do not have shingles. Symptoms and diagnosis Shingles is a painful rash, usually on one side of the trunk of the body. The pain can still stay after the rash has disappeared and is called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). If the rash affects the face it may involve the surface of the eye which can cause blindness. In some cases, the virus can lead to herpes zoster encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. VZV is diagnosed by growing (culturing) the virus from a swab taken from a lesion, or by using a fluorescent screening test to detect the virus. Treatment The main goal of treatment is to kill the infectious virus in the skin and prevent it from spreading. The mainstay of treatment is acyclovir. The standard doses of the tablets which are given to treat herpes simplex are not adequate for herpes zoster; tablet doses of around 4000 mg/day may be given, or the drug may be administered in intravenous form. Acyclovir has very few side-effects. VZV can develop resistance to acyclovir. Foscarnet may be effective in these cases. The drugs sorivudine, famciclovir and BW882C87 are also being tested as treatments for zoster. Prophylaxis It is usually recommended that people with HIV who have not previously been exposed to herpes zoster (e.g. they cannot recall having had chicken pox in childhood) but who have recently been exposed to other people with active herpes zoster infection should be treated with varicella zoster immune globulin - a concentrated form of anti-zoster antibodies. Immune globulin is only protective if given within 4 days of exposure. A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 285 [Page 286](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/292?q1=directories) Recurrences of shingles are less frequent than recurrences of herpes simplex, and secondary prophylaxis is not normally given. Research Glesby reported that in a multicentre observational cohort study of 1044 people with AIDS or ARC and CD4 count below 250, 163 patients (16%) had a history of herpes zoster at enrollment, and 22 (13%) had a recurrence during the 2-year follow-up. Progression to AIDS was not associated with herpes zoster. By proportional hazards analysis, an initial occurrence of herpes zoster was associated with prolonged survival independent of baseline CD4 cell count and disease stage; however, recurrence tended to be associated with death. Jacobson reported the development of acyclovir-resistant VZV in 4 HIV-infected patients who were receiving long-term oral acyclovir (400-4000 mg/day) for 1-5 months for HSV AIDS virus (VZV) with fosccrnet (40 mg/kg intravenous every 8 hours for more than 10 days). 4/5 patients had complete or nearly complete healing of lesions. 2/4 had a relapse 7-14 days after completing foscarnet therapy; isolates from both patients showed susceptibility to acyclovir in vitro. 1 relapse patient responded to intravenous acyclovir; 1 patient did not respond to oral acyclovir (4000 mg/day for 12 days). Tyring treated 419 people who had suffered the onset of an attack of herpes zoster within the last 3 days with either famciclovir or placebo. Famciclovir appeared effective in reducing the length of time that VZV could be detected in the lesions as well as speeding up the healing of lesions in at least some of the recipients, compared with placebo. There were no significant side-effects. In a subset of 55 people who experienced post-herpetic neuralgia, placebo recipients continued to experience pain for an average of 128 days, but the average duration of pain among famciclovir recipients was more than halved.

SWasting syndrome Involuntary weight loss, or wasting, is one of the most common symptoms of HIV infection. It can occur at any stage of infection and usually suggests that the HIV disease is progressing. Weight loss may be quite substantial and get progressively greater. In addition, chronic unintended weight loss is associated with malnutrition, which may contribute to increased immune suppression, including reduction of T-lymphocyte helper and suppressor cells, altered phagocytic functions and decreased killer-cell activity. Weight loss can result from malabsorption and associated diarrhoea, reduced food intake and altered metabolism. Malabsorption is impaired uptake of nutrients from the intestines. Nutrients are normally absorbed from food in the intestines by cells that make up finger-like protrusions called villi that line the intestinal wall. Certain disease processes including HIV infection can cause the villi to wither (atrophy) and shorten. This cell malfunction results in impaired absorption of nutrients. Many people with HIV or AIDS experience diarrhoea at same point. It can occur in people who are very healthy or very ill, and be short-lived and occasional or continuous. In Africa, diarrhoea ia a major cause of death in HIV-infected children; Zairian infants have an 11 -fold increased risk of dying from diarrhoea compared with uninfected infants. Malabsorption and diarrhoea can be caused by a number of opportunistic infections, including parasitic infections such belli, Giardia lamblia; viral infections such CMV; and bacterial infections such as MAI, Salmonella, Campylobacter and Shigella. When people with HIV have diarrhoea, specific pathogens can often be identified in faecal samples. People with HIV may also experience diarrhoea for which no specific cause can be identified. This is often referred to as pathogen-negative diarrhoea. Weight loss may simply caused by reduced food intake. This may be a result of oral ulcerations and lesions due to candidiasis, herpes simplex, or other diseases may cause painful or difficult swallowing. Thrush, although not painful, may alter the sense of taste or cause nausea. Neuropsychological disorders associated with HIV infection can result in loss of appetite (anorexia). The depression and anxiety that may accompany a life-threatening illness often disrupt normal routines and also suppress the appetite. Psychosis and organic brain diseases such as HIV-encephalopathy, toxoplasmosis, and cryptococcal meningitis can also inhibit a person's desire or ability to eat. Treatment-induced weight loss may result as a side-effect of some drugs. High-dose sulphonamides, antimycobacterial agents and other medications have been associated with anorexia and subsequent weight loss. Fungal superinfections of any part of the gastrointestinal tract can follow an extended course of antibiotics and may contribute to anorexia or diarrhoea. People with HIV may also experience changes in their metabolism which lead to weight loss. Depletion of lean body muscle mass has been observed in people at all stages of HIV infection. Kotler reports that wasting syndrome is distinguished from starvation in that the former results in body-fat content preservation while body cell mass is depleted. This progressive wasting may result solely from the underlying HIV infection. The catabolic effects of any debilitating illness or opportunistic infection may result in weight loss and generalised wasting without evidence of anorexia or malabsorption. Treatments for weight loss In the USA Dronabinol is a licensed appetetite stimulant for people with AIDS-related wasting. Megestrol acetate has also been approved in the USA for the treatment of anorexia, cahchexia or unexplained significant weight loss in people with AIDS. Drugs such as Lomotil and tincture of opium as well as non-prescription anti-diarrhoea medicines (e.g. Imodium) are commonly used to relieve gastrointestinal irritation and diarrhoea. 286 A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS [Page 287](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/293?q1=directories) Human growth hormone can lead to significant increases in lean body mass (i.e. muscle) in people with wasting syndrome. Other nutritional interventions such as appetite stimulation and nutritional support tend to increase body weight due to the accumulation of fat. An increase in lean body mass is thought to be much more important since studies have shown that people who lose lean body mass are at increased risk of dying. Following the presentation of promising trial results at the 10th International Conference on AIDS in Yokohama in August 1994, the manufacturer of a form of human growth hormone known by the tradename Saizen has applied for it to be formally licensed as a treatment for wasting. Octreotide has been shown to be better than standard anti-diarrhoea treatments at reducing number of bowel movements and volume of diarrhoea in a controlled trial. It is thought to inhibit intestinal secretion and enhance water and electrolyte absorption. Liquid nutritional supplements may be helpful for people who eat but do not gain weight and for those who have difficulty eating solid food. There is no consensus about the time to begin such supplementation or the type of supplement that is most beneficial. Generally, however, a free amino acid elemental oral food supplement or an intact modular food supplement is used to augment a high calorie, high protein, low fat, lactose-free diet. Many formulations of these nutritional supplements are available; use of these supplements may be individualised according to personal taste. Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is an intravenous method of nutritional supplementation reserved for people with severely compromised bowel function who are unable to meet their nutritional needs from food. The procedure involves infusing a liquid nutrient preparation directly into the bloodstream through a central venous line. Research Smith report that specific pathogens can be isolated in the majority of people with gastrointestinal problems. Grohmann detected viruses in 35% of faecal specimens from 65 HIV-positive people with diarrhoea compared to only 12% of specimens taken at the same time from 65 HIV-positive people without diarrhoea. People with diarrhoea were more likely to have astrovirus, picobirnavirus, caliciviruses and adenoviruses. However, Ullrich suggest that abnormalities of the intestinal lining can also result from HIV infection itself. Dronabinol has been approved as an appetite stimulant in AIDS patients with wasting. Olson enrolled 139 AIDS patients in a double-blind placebo-controlled study dose-ranging pilot trial. All patients were at least 2.3 kg below their ideal body weights and were free from intercurrent illness. Patients were randomized to receive dronabinol (2.5 mg twice daily) or placebo for six weeks, at which time all patients received dronabinol in an open-label extension of the study. After the randomized study, 50/72 dronabinol recipients and 38/67 placebo recipients were evaluable. Appetite (measured on a visual analog scale) was significantly improved in the dronabinol group. Mean weight change was 0.1 kg in the dronabinol group and -0.4 kg in the placebo group (NS). At the end of the first month of the open-label extension study, 7/18 patients who had originally received dronabinol had gained 2 kg, compared to 2/17 patients who had originally received placebo. Although CNS side-effects were common in the dronabinol group, adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of therapy were equally frequent in the two groups (5 on dronabinol and 4 on placebo). Compean enrolled 20 men with AIDS and large-volume refractory diarrhoea in a study comparing octreotide (100, 200 and 300 g subcutaneously every 8 hours) with a control arm of standard anti-diarrhoea medication (high doses of loperamide and diphenyloxylate) plus placebo. Compared with the control group, after 10 days octreotide recipients experienced a significant reduction in mean bowel movements per day (2.1 versus 7) and mean stool volume (ml) per day (485 versus 1080). Complete response (stool volume less than 250 ml/day) was observed in 2 people in the octreotide group and none in the control arm; partial responses (greater than 50% reduction in stool volume) occurred in 4 and 2 respectively, and no response in 4 and 8 respectively. Side-effects occurred in /10 octreotide recipients and 3/10 controls, but the only side-effect that was more common in octreotide recipients was pain at the injection site, and none required discontinuation of treatment. Cello enrolled 51 patients with HIV-related wasting in an open-label dose-escalating study of octreotide (50, 100, 250, 500 g subcutaneously three times daily). 21/51 patients (41.2%) had a complete response (reduction in daily stool volume by 50% or reduction to below 250 mL per day). 14/21 responders (67%) had no identifiable pathogens at initial screening compared to 9/30 (30%) nonresponders. Reduction in stool volume from baseline was associated with doses higher than 50 g. Side-effects included burning at injection site, nausea and vomiting. Romeu treated 25 patients with chronic diarrhoea with octreotide (150 g/day increased progressively at 48 hour intervals to 300, 750 and 1500 g/day according to response). 10 patients (4 with Cryptosporidium enteritis, 5 without an identifiable pathogen and 1 with I.belli enteritis) achieved a complete response (40%) and 9 cases (all with cryptosporidial enteritis) had a partial response (36%). Patients with higher weight and Karnofsky status and non-cryptosporidial enteritis had a better response to treatment. 16/19 responders (84%) received doses of octreotide between 100 and 250 g every 8 hours. Only 3 patients (15%) required 1500 g/day to reach response (1 complete, 2 partial responses). Koster randomised 60 people with AIDS wasting (median weight loss 17% from baseline, median CD4 count 21) into 4 groups: recombinant human Growth Hormone (rhGH) 1.4 mg/day subcutaneously; recombinant human Insulin-like Growth Factor type 1 (rhlGF) 5 mg twice daily subcutaneously; both hormones; or placebo for 12 weeks. After 6 weeks lean body mass had increased by 0.8 kg compared to placebo in each of the monotherapy treatment arms, and by 2.0 kg in the combination arm. Increase in lean body mass was accompanied by a decrease in body fat among participants receiving rhlGF, and was associated with significant improvement in health status on 7 of the 14 domains. No effects on muscle strength or immunological or virological parameters were seen. All hormone recipients experienced oedema. Schambelan enrolled 178 people who had lost over 10% of their body weight, or whose weight was less than 90% of the ideal, in a placebo-controlled trial of human growth hormone (HGH) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day for three months. Preliminary results indicate that the treated group had a highly significant increase in lean body mass averaging 3 kg. The treatment also significantly improved participants ability to exercise. No effects on CD4 counts, HIV p24 antigen levels, disease progression or survival were observed. Mild side-effects included abnormalities in blood tests and oedema. Krentz enrolled 10 patients in a double-blind randomised prospective trial of human recombinant growth hormone (2.5 or 5.0 mg subcutaneously every other day). Weight loss was reversed in 4/4 patients who completed the study. Weight gain was associated with increases in total body water, lean body mass and urinary nitrogen secretion/kg). Muscle strength and endurance also improved. All 4 patients lost weight again 6 weeks after completion of the study and termination of treatment. Mulligan treated six men with HIV-related weight loss (mean loss of 19%) with a constant metabolic diet and rHGH (0.1 mg/kg/day for seven days). The men were hospitalized, as were six HIV-negative volunteers who served as controls. A mean body weight increase of 2.0 (+0.3 kg) was observed in the HIV-positive men compared with 1.6 +0.2 kg increase in the control group. Increases in protein anabolism and lipid oxidation were observed. Von Roenn enrolled 271 patients in a phase III randomised dose-ranging placebo controlled trial of megestrol acetate (100 mg, 400 mg or 800 mg every day for 12 weeks). 270 and 195 were evaluable for safety and efficacy, respectively. Of those receiving 800 mg/day, 62.3% gained 5 pounds or more, compared with 25% of the placebo group. Recipients of 800 mg/day reported improvement in overall well-being and had an increase in mean weight gain, lean body mass, appetite grade and calorific intake compared with placebo recipients. Oster enrolled 100 patients in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of megestrol acetate (MA) (800 mg/day). MA recipients increased their daily calorific intake by 608 calories, versus an increase of 134 in the placebo group. People treated with MA had a mean body weight increase of 3.86 kg, compared with 0.46 kg decrease in the placebo group, and gained 3.68 kg in fat compared with a 0.28 kg loss. No statistically significant differences in body water, lean mass or survival were observed between the groups. Tierney randomised people with AIDS with a greater than or equal to 10% weight loss to receive a daily dose of 100, 400 or 800 mg of megestrol acetete or placebo during a three month double-blind trial. 19/21 evaluable treated sublects gained weight (1.5 - 29 Ibs), while those randomized to receive placebo continued to lose weight. The 2 treated subjects who lost weight had developed an esophageal ulcer and histoplasmosis, respectively. Megestrol acetate was associated with significant weight gain with a linear dose response relationship. An increase in both lean body mass and body fat was detected using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Weight gain was associated with an increase in A-Z OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 287 [Page 288](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/294?q1=directories) appetite and food intake. No improvements in CD3, CD4, CD8 counts or skin reactivity was seen. While Karnofsky scores did not change, improvement in perceived quality of life was associated with weight gain. Graham enrolled 10 patients with HIV-related wasting in a pharmacokinetic evaluation study of a new suspension formulation of megestrol acetate 40 mg/ml. All patients received a single oral dose of 800 mg/day for 21 days. All patients reported an increase in appetite and 8/10 patients gained weight at three weeks. Tierney treated 9 HIV-positive patients with chronic diarrhoea and no enteric pathogens with mesalamine (6 g/day orally). Diarrhoeal symptoms improved in 7/9 patients, and rectal p24 content was significantly reduced over 2 months. No side-effects were reported. Ter6n enrolled 18 people who had lost at least 10% of their body weight during the last 6 months in a 12-week placebo-controlled trial of thalidomide (400 mg four times a day). Although no differences in CD4 count or viral load could be seen, 8/9 thalidomide recipients had weight stabilisation or gain versus 2/9 in the placebo group. Treated participants had significantly higher Karnofsky scores than placebo recipients at the end of the study. 8/9 thalidomide recipients developed mild and transient somnolence or erythematous macular lesions. Couderc treated three people with AIDS and wasting with open-label thalidomide 100 mg daily. The three patients all gained weight (mean gain of 5 kg within three weeks) and had reduced constitutional symptoms. No changes in CD4 counts or serum TNF-alpha levels were observed. No adverse reactions were noted. Landman treated five people with AIDS-related wasting with pentoxifylline (400 mg three times daily). The rationale for the treatment was based on pentoxifylline's anti-TNF-alpha activity; TNF-alpha may a role in the pathogenesis of AIDS wasting. 3/5 patients had elevated serum TNF-alpha levels. No significant weight gain was observed in any of the patients. In the two patients without elevated TNF-alpha, continued to lose weight and also developed bacterial pneumonia within 3 weeks of starting therapy. Coodley demonstrated markedly lower testosterone levels in people with AIDS who had wasting syndrome as compared with people who had similar CD4 counts but no wasting. Testosterone replacement may be a potential treatment for people with HIV-associated wasting. Jekot suggested that anabolic steroids may have a role in the treatment of AIDS-related weight loss; however, no data from controlled clinical trials in AIDS patients have been reported.

The following list is not meant to be exhaustive but describes the most common symptoms, their causes and what to do if they occur. If you are at all worried by any symptoms or problems you should always discuss theM with your doctor. * Anorexia This is a loss of appetite or having no desire to eat. Causes It is often a general symptom of an acute illness or infection especially if this involves the gut and is accompanied by either nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting or mouth problems. Other causes include emotional problems such as stress, anxiety and depression or certain drug treatments including chemotherapy and antibiotics. What to do The desire to eat will quickly return once the underlying infection or illness is treated and is often the first indicator of recovery. Whatever the cause, maintaining good nutrition is very important and can be helped by eating little but often, especially your favourite foods, or taking high calorie drinks as dietary supplements. Appetite stimulants and advice from a dietician may be helpful especially if the anorexia is chronic. See also: nausea, weight loss. * Anxiety This is a feeling of foreboding, panic or apprehension and is frequently accompanied by physical symptoms of sweating, palpitations, agitation, nervousness, headaches and anorexia. If severe and sudden, anxiety may result in a panic attack. Cause Anxiety may be caused by any problem that results in fear, uncertainty or a feeling of insecurity. Examples are coping with a new diagnosis, acute illness, the prospect of ill health or social difficulties such as housing and finance. What to do If the anxiety concerns a practical problem then getting advice and information and dealing with this may help. If it is related to other issues then talking things over with A-Z OF SYMPTOMS 289 [Page 290](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/296?q1=directories) someone who you can trust such as a close friend or a trained counsellor can be useful. Often having more information or deciding on options on how to cope with difficulties helps to allay anxiety and reduce stress. Complementary therapies or specific relaxation techniques may help in alleviating the physical symptoms of anxiety. Drugs such as benzodiazepines - including valium - are rarely of help and in the long term are addictive. They may, however, be useful in severe acute anxiety if given for short periods only. See also: depression. SBlackouts, fits, funny turns This is the sudden loss or near loss of consciousness and may be accompanied by dizziness, vertigo, headache or (if due to a fit/convulsion) incontinence. Causes The most common cause is a simple faint which is the body's protective mechanism to ensure a sufficient blood supply gets to the brain. However HIV may affect the nerves that control blood pressure and result in dizziness or near blackouts when standing or sitting up quickly (postural hypertension). A potentially more serious cause is a fit or convulsion as this might indicate an acute problem in the brain such as an infection or abscess, possibly a result of toxoplasmosis. What to do If a blackout has occurred it is important to tell your doctor or if the cause is definitely a fit to get medical advice urgently. It is useful to talk to anyone who witnessed the blackout to find out exactly what happened as this may help to determine the cause. If the blackout was due to postural hypertension then treatment and advice can be given to help cope with this. SBreathlessness This is a difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath and may first be noted when running for a bus or going up a flight of stairs. Symptoms of cough, fever and chest pain may also develop. Breathlessness may occur slowly over a few days or weeks or happen more suddenly depending on the cause. Causes If accompanied with cough and fever then this is usually due to an underlying lung infection (pneumonia). Causes include bacterial infections, tuberculosis or opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis canrinii pneumonia (PCP). The risk of PCP is, however, uncommon in someone whose CD4 count is greater than 200. Non-infective causes of breathlessness include Kaposi's sarcoma in the lungs, asthma, heart problems and a low blood count (anaemia). What to do It is important to seek urgent medical advice because if the problem is a pneumonia then early treatment and diagnosis will usually result in less severe illness and more rapid recovery. Apart from treating the underlying cause breathlessness can be relieved by breathing oxygen via a mask. This also allows body tissues to get the supply of oxygen they need, avoiding damage. See also: cough. SBruising Bruising which appears to be unrelated to any trauma or are larger and more severe than normal can occur in HIV infection. This may be associated with other problems such as frequent nose bleeds or bleeding from the gums when brushing your teeth. Causes Apart from inherited clotting disorders of haemophilia, the cause in HIV infection is usually the result of a low number of certain blood cells (platelets) which are essential for normal clotting. Low platelets (thrombocytopenia) may be caused by the direct effects of HIV or certain drug treatments on the bone marrow. What to do It is important to seek urgent medical advice as there is a risk of internal bleeding. In these circumstances it is also important to avoid flying as this may increase the risk of bleeding. * Cough A cough may bring up green or clear sputum from the chest or be non-productive and dry. Other symptoms which occur with a cough include breathlessness, chest pain and coryza (cold). Causes Frequently the cause is a simple cold, viral infection of the throat or especially, if you are a smoker, a bacterial bronchitis. Green or yellow sputum usually indicates a bacterial infection which will respond to treatment with antibiotics. These problems may be no more severe in someone with HIV than for anyone else, but in someone with more advanced HIV disease could lead to more serious infections in the chest if not treated early and adequately. The main cause of concern in people with low CD4 counts (less than 200) is PCP, an opportunistic infection of the lung. If you are taking adequate prevention treatments such as co-trimoxazole then the risk of this is much reduced. Other causes of cough are lesions in the throat or lungs due to Kaposi's sarcoma. What to do If associated with a cold or viral throat infection then simple over the counter remedies may bring some relief. If the cough is productive with green or discoloured sputum then treatment with a course of antibiotics may be necessary. If 290 A-Z OF SYMPTOMS [Page 291](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/297?q1=directories) accompanied with the onset of breathlessness then you should see your doctor urgently for help and treatment. See also: breathlessness. * Depression This is a mood of sadness, hopelessness and dejection, and may be accompanied by anxiety, sleeping problems, poor concentration and motivation, weight loss and anorexia. Causes Depression is frequently the result of or the reaction to illness or social problems, but on occasions no specific cause or factors can be identified. Most people, however, experience shortlived downswings of mood or periods of unhappiness and these should be differentiated from the more severe states of depression which although can be precipitated by stressful events can also often occur alongside physical illness. Depression can be quite disabling and if severe can mimic the symptoms of dementia. What to do If the reason for depression is practical difficulties then dealing with these or obtaining advice on how to resolve them may be of help. For more severe depression then help is available from trained counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists either through your local clinic or voluntary HIV/AIDS services. Anti-depressant drugs may be of help especially if depression is accompanied by physical symptoms such as weight loss, they take a few weeks to work and have side effects which should be discussed with your doctor. See also: anxiety, memory problems. Markowitz JC et al. Treating depression in HIV-positive patients. AIDS 8(4):403-412,1994 * Dermatitis This is a common problem in HIV and normally occurs as a patchy red, flaky rash especially on the face and neck. It is associated with generalised dryness of the skin and itching. Causes Fungal infections, seborrhoeic dermatitis or eczema. What to do As a general rule for dry skin and seborrhoeic dermatitis/eczema avoid using soap, and instead use emollients (moisturizers) such as aqueous cream as soap substitutes. Alternatively add oils to the bath water and apply plenty of emollients/moisturizers to the skin after bathing. Antifungal creams alone or in combination with mild topical steroids may be helpful but strong steroid creams should be avoided unless used under the supervision of a doctor. * Diarrhoea This may mean anything from a semi-loose to a completely liquid stool and may result in having to go to the toilet more frequently and urgently. Other symptoms which can accompany diarrhoea include stomach pains, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and fever. Causes Diarrhoea is common in HIV disease especially in persons with low CD4 counts. Infections are frequently the cause and include Cryptosporidium, Microsporidium, CMV, MAI, giardiasis, Salmonella and Shigella. Diarrhoea can also be a side effect of treatment with antibiotics as the normal bacterial flora of the gut is disturbed. This may result in a secondary infection with the bacteria Clostridium difficile which can result in severe and persistent diarrhoea. Other drugs which cause diarrhoea include the anti-HIV agent ddl. A specific cause is not always found and the diarrhoea is then usually attributed to the direct effect of HIV on the gut especially if accompanied with weight loss (wasting syndrome). What to do As diarrhoea may result in excessive loss of salts and water from the body, it is important to drink plenty of fluid or alternatively special oral rehydration drinks. Diarrhoea will usually settle in a few days but if it is severe or becomes persistent then it is important to see your doctor for investigations and treatment. If chronic, then anti-diarrhoeal agents such as imodium and codeine may be of help. As weight loss may accompany diarrhoea improving your diet and getting advice on nutrition is important. Severe diarrhoea can cause soreness around the anus and other practical problems which the district nurse or those at the clinic or hospital will be able to advise you on how to cope with. Bed linen and clothes may need to be washed more frequently and help may be provided through local social services or AIDS charities. See also: weight loss. = Fatigue Lethargy and tiredness is a frequent problem especially in advanced disease. It may be quite debilitating and interfere with the ability to carry on working or other routine activities. Causes Apart from the direct effects of HIV, symptoms of fatigue may be made worse by anaemia, depression, acute infection and weight loss. What to do Treatment of underlying medical problems such as anaemia may help but if the fatigue is due to HIV and is debilitating then practical help with routine daily tasks may be needed. Such help is available from local social services or voluntary HIV/AIDS agencies. Respite care and convalescence is also available in specialist centres such as the London Lighthouse, the Sanctuary in Bournmouth or other centres in the UK. A-Z OF SYMPTOMS 291 [Page 292](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/298?q1=directories) Decisions about when to give up work and accepting help in your home are difficult as they alter your sense of independence. Specialist HIV/AIDS social workers, counsellors and advice workers can help you in this decision making and try and provide you with a range of services that suit your needs but continues to respect your independence. * Fevers Fevers or high temperatures may be persistent or intermittent and cause shivers (rigors) and sweating. Causes Fever most commonly indicates an underlying infection but may also be a general feature of HIV disease or related to a drug allergy. What to do If the cause is minor like a cold or viral sore throat then ensure you drink plenty of fluids and take aspirin or paracetamol to bring your temperature down. If, however, the fever is prolonged or accompanied by other more severe symptoms then you should consult your doctor to identify and treat the underlying cause. * Gingivitis This is pain and soreness around the gums often accompanied with bleeding and ulcers. Causes Dental carries. What to do Local measures to control dental carries are important and include use of mouth washes and brushing your teeth regularly and properly. If severe, treatment with antibiotics may be needed but regular visits to the dentist or oral hygienist for check ups, cleaning and general dental advice are helpful as preventative measures. See also: mouth ulcers. * Headaches The site character and severity of headaches are variable. Fever, neurological symptoms (such as weakness or numbness), visual problems, anxiety and depression may all occur with headaches depending on the cause. Causes As in anybody else the common causes in HIV are stress, tension, migraine and sinusitis. More serious causes in HIV are meningitis, cerebral toxoplasmosis and lymphoma. What to do Simple measures like rest, relaxation and pain killers may be all that is needed, but if the headache is severe, prolonged, recurrent or associated with neurological problems, such as confusion, then you should consult your doctor. * Insomnia This is a difficulty with sleeping, waking early or getting off to sleep. Causes Insomnia is commonly caused by psychological or emotional problems such as stress, anxiety, worries and depression. Physical problems particularly pain, fevers, night sweats and general ill health can also all contribute to poor sleeping patterns. What to do Sleeping well or having a good night's rest is essential and every effort should be made to find out the causes of insomnia and either treat or rectify these. Simple practical measures like ensuring a comfortable, warm, noise-free bedroom and avoiding stimulants like coffee or tea during the late evening may help. Sleeping tablets should only be used as a last resort and for short periods only. See also: anxiety, depression. * Memory problems Forgetfulness, difficulty in remembering or recalling facts are symptoms that many people with symptomatic HIV infection report. Often they accompany symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression but are more serious if associated with odd behaviour, personality change, disorientation, fits or problems with walking. Causes Many people can be forgetful, especially at times of stress or anxiety, but if the problem is progressive and severe or associated with other cognitive problems then this could be due to either HIV encephalopathy (AIDS dementia complex), CMV encephalitis or severe depression. Opportunistic infections (such as toxoplasmosis) or tumours (such as lymphomas) which affect the brain can cause and contribute to memory and mental problems and should be excluded first. Drugs, especially benzodiazepines, tranquilizers and alcohol can also be factors. In someone with asymptomatic HIV infection significant neuro-cognitive problems - such as the features of dementia - do not occur and are usually seen only in persons with advanced HIV disease. What to do If you have concerns about your memory or other mental problems then these need to be discussed with your doctor or counsellor. Investigations may need to be undertaken to exclude opportunistic infections or tumours. A psychologist may use tests to assess the problem and help to decide whether depression and anxiety are contributing. Assumptions that memory problems are all related to an HIV encephalopathy should not be made until other causes have been investigated, excluded or treated. Decisions about work and advice on how to cope with the practical problems of cognitive impairment will then need to be 292 A-Z OF SYMPTOMS [Page 293](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/299?q1=directories) considered with the help of your counsellors, doctors and carers. See also: depression. M Mouth ulcers Multiple or single large ulcers in the mouth are a common problem and may interfere with eating and swallowing. Causes They are commonly caused by Candida or herpes simplex virus infections or be simple aphthous ulcers. Infrequently, they can be caused by Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, a low white cell count (neutropenia) or develop into large atypical non-specific ulcers. What to do For aphthous ulcers which tend to be small and recurrent then simple measures such as mouth washes, local anaesthetic, steroid gels or pastes may be all that is needed. If, however, the ulcers are very painful, persistent or large then consult your doctor or specialist HIV dental services. Mouth ulcers if untreated can interfere with eating, appetite and affect nutrition and weight. * Nausea A feeling of wanting to vomit or be sick. Causes These are multiple but in HIV infection are commonly due to stomach problems such as diarrhoeal illness, drugs, acute infection and emotional problems such as anxiety. What to do If associated with other symptoms then the underlying cause needs to be investigated and treated. If due to drugs then the dose and frequency may need to be altered or the drug discontinued. Anti-nausea medication (anti-emetics), either as tablets or injections can be prescribed and may be necessary if a specific drug treatment need to be continued (such as high dose co-trimoxazole). See also: anorexia. * Night sweats This is a common problem in HIV and may either be mild and infrequent or be quite severe and result in the need to change bed linen or your clothes. Causes If it is a new problem and accompanied by a fever an acute infection is often the cause. More specific causes include tuberculosis and lymphoma. If the night sweats are chronic, then HIV infection is usually responsible and is then a feature of symptomatic disease. What to do If accompanied by fever then a cause, other than HIV, needs to be excluded. Practical measures such as taking an aspirin or paracetamol before sleeping may be helpful. If severe and accompanied by other symptoms of HIV disease then anti-HIV drug treatments may be considered. See also: fever. * Numbness Loss of feeling or alteration in sensation (such as pins and needles) can occur in HIV infection especially in the toes, feet and hands. Causes HIV can cause inflammation of the peripheral nerves (peripheral neuropathy) but drugs (such as ddl, ddC, chemotherapy regimens), vitamin deficiencies and alcohol can also be responsible. What to do These symptoms should be discussed with your doctor and the underlying cause established. Practical measures such as taking good care of your feet, wearing good fitting shoes or seeing a chiropodist are important. * Pain The site, nature and character of pain can be very variable but whether it is acute or chronic can interfere greatly with quality of life and contribute to emotional problems. Causes These are multiple and varied but if related to an acute problem such as an infection should resolve once this is treated. Chronic pain in HIV is often caused by gut, neurological or skeletal problems. Sometimes no specific cause is found or is due to multiple factors but whatever the cause, pain can result in a great deal of emotional distress. What to do As pain can be so distressing and disabling it is important to find out the underlying cause and provide treatment. Conventional medicine is good at controlling acute pain and there are many medications of various strengths that can be prescribed. Treatment of chronic pain may be more difficult and thus it may be important to involve the specialist services and expertise of palliative care nurses and doctors. There really is no excuse for not controlling pain and this should be discussed with your doctor and carers together with the possible side effects of painkilling drugs and other available treatment options such as physiotherapy and nerve blocks. Alternatively, complementary therapies such as acupuncture, massage and osteopathy may be helpful. * Rashes A red blotchy generalised rash over the whole of the body starting soon or several days after starting a new A-Z OF SYMPTOMS 293 [Page 294](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/300?q1=directories) medication suggests an allergy. The rash may be accompanied by intense itching, fevers and if severe, mouth ulceration. Causes Many drugs can cause a rash and this appears to happen more frequently in persons with HIV especially AIDS. Antibiotics are frequently the cause, particularly penicillins or co-trimoxazole. What to do Stop taking the drug and notify your doctor what has happened. Antihistamines such as piriton may be of help. If the allergic reaction is severe then you should seek urgent help from your doctors as hospitalisation and urgent treatment may be necessary. *Sexual problems Loss of sexual drive or desire (libido) is a common problem of chronic ill health and can contribute to emotional problems (eg depression), quality of life and feelings of self worth. Causes Impotence and the loss of libido are commonly the result of emotional distress, depression or the physical symptoms of a chronic illness. In HIV the fear of transmission of the virus to your partner and the fear of rejection are major contributing factors. Rarely loss of libido can be caused by a specific and treatable disease unrelated to HIV. Lower than normal levels of sex hormones have been found in advanced HIV infection and are probably the result of either the direct effect of HIV or of the chronic ill health/illness. Impotence may also be caused by HIV damaging the nerves which control penile erection (autonomic neuropathy) or by a problem in the spine such as myelopathy. What to do The importance of a good sex life in any relationship varies from person to person but may clearly affect quality of life. Discussing these problems, fears and anxieties openly with your partner or talking to a counsellor to try and overcome these difficulties can be of help. In some clinics and hospitals specific psychosexual counsellors and psychologists may be available. * Swallowing difficulties Pain when eating or swallowing especially in the throat or gullet (oesophagus) is a common presenting problem in persons with symptomatic HIV disease. Causes More often than not this is due to a candida infection which results in inflammation and ulceration in the oesophagus and pharynx. Other causes simplex virus infection, Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoma. What to do These symptoms need to be discussed with your doctor. If due to a candida infection then rapid relief can be achieved by treatment with an antifungal drug. Occasionally it may be necessary to carry out a gastroscopy to establish a diagnosis. * Visual problems Blurred, or partial loss of vision is a symptom which many people with HIV infection are very apprehensive and fearful of. Causes CMV infection with the resulting damage to the retina (retinitis) is the most common cause but other opportunistic infections of the eye include toxoplasmosis, Cryptococcus and Candida. These only occur in persons with symptomatic HIV disease who have very low CD4 counts. What to do If visual symptoms develop urgent and prompt consultation with your doctor and subsequent referral to a medical ophthalmologist is needed. Treatment of CMV retinitis can halt and prevent further visual loss. Practical difficulties of coping with visual impairment may be multiple and include coping with everyday activities such as cooking, bathing, taking medication, shopping and driving. Help is available from occupational therapists, local social services and specialist HIV/AIDS voluntary services. Adjusting to visual impairment can cause marked emotional problems and help from counselling services may be needed. * Walking difficulties Any problem that can interfere with mobility, whether this is simply with using public transport or more seriously involves getting in and out of a chair, can severely affect independence and quality of life. Causes These are multiple and include weakness and numbness in the feet and legs, painful conditions, breathing difficulties and visual impairment. General debilitation, weakness and fatigue can also contribute. What to do Certain problems with mobility with neurological symptoms (such as weakness in the legs) need to be investigated. Social services and voluntary agencies may help with maintaining mobility and independence and include the provision of taxi cards, transport to and fro from hospitals and clinics and the mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance. Occupational therapist may help with provision of walking aids, wheelchairs and advice on how to cope at home. * Weight loss Loss of weight either suddenly, over a short period of time or more acutely or progressively over many months is a common problem but is of particular concern in persons with symptomatic HIV disease. 294 A-Z OF SYMPTOMS [Page 295](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/301?q1=directories) Causes Opportunistic infections, diarrhoea, anorexia, mouth problems, depression and anxiety can all contribute. A more specific cause is the direct effect of HIV on the gut and increased energy requirements needed by the body to fight infection. What to do Dealing with or preventing weight loss is an important aspect of general treatment of HIV disease. Specific problems such as diarrhoea, acute infections and nausea should be investigated and treated. Medical advice and help from a dietician should be sought and supplementary measures such as high calorie drinks, vitamins and appetite stimulants (such as megestrol) may be of help. See also: diarrhoea, anorexia. A-Z OF SYMPTOMS 295 [Page 296](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/302?q1=directories) A to Z of Medical tests * Introduction Medical tests and procedures are both an integral part of the monitoring HIV disease and the investigation and treatment of symptoms. Before any test is carried out, it is important to know what is the reason for the test, what it involves (description) and how will the result help. It is part of good medical practice to ensure that this information is discussed and that the patient gives their consent. The following list is not meant to be exhaustive but details some of the medical tests and procedures that are commonly carried out in persons with HIV and AIDS. CD4 counts and virological tests are discuused in more detail in Immunity and Disease. * Blood count When and why This is a routine blood (haematology) test which can be part of either the general investigation of an acute illness, or regular monitoring of HIV infection or of the side-effects of certain drug treatments (eg zidovudine, chemotherapy). A small sample of blood is taken from a vein in the arm (venesection). You should ask to lie down before the procedure should you feel you might faint/become dizzy. How it will help A blood count (FBC) can: * Detect whether someone is anaemic (low haemoglobin). Anaemia can contribute to the symptoms of fatigue and breathlessness. * Measure the number and different type of white cells in the blood. If there are insufficient numbers of white cells especially of neutrophils (neutropenia) then the risk of infection is higher. There is treatment such as G-CSF which can increase the number of neutrophils in the blood by stimulating production in the bone marrow. * Measure the level of platelets. These are small blood cells essential for normal clotting and if very low in number (thrombocytopenia) can cause bruising and bleeding. 296 A-Z OF MEDICAL TESTS [Page 297](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/303?q1=directories) * Blood cultures When and why These are important for investigating the cause of a severe or persistent fever especially if bacterial infections including MAI are suspected. A small sample of blood is taken from a vein in the arm and put into special blood culture bottles. Before taking blood the skin needs to be cleaned thoroughly, this prevents contamination of the culture bottles with normal skin bacteria. How it will help Growing and identifying the infecting organism ensures the correct diagnosis is made and the appropriate antibiotics and treatment given. * Blood gases When and why This test assesses whether the body is short of oxygen and is part of the investigation into symptoms of breathlessness, cough and fever. A small sample of blood is taken from an artery either at the wrist or in the groin where a pulse can be felt. This procedure can cause some pain and discomfort but the use of a local anaesthetic should prevent this. How it will help The result tells the doctor how well the lungs are functioning and gives an indication of the severity of the underlying problem (such as pneumonia). This information will help decide what is the best treatment and may determine if the patient needs to go to the intensive care unit. Taking blood gases is not always necessary and for many situations is now replaced by using a pulse oximeter which involves attaching a probe to a finger and measuring the level of oxygen saturation in the blood. Although this is a simple non-invasive procedure it does not provide all the information which analysis of arterial blood gases can. * Bone marrow When and why In HIV disease a bone marrow biopsy is usually carried out to help find out what is the cause of a persistent fever, an anaemia (low blood count) or another blood cell disorder such as a low platelet count. A sample of bone marrow is usually taken from both the pelvic bone just above and behind the hip and from the sternum (breast bone). To ensure the procedure is painless a local anaesthetic is injected into the skin and soft tissues over the bone. There may, however, be some discomfort once the effect of the local anaesthetic has worn off and this can be eased by taking a pain-killing tablet. A bone marrow biopsy is a routine procedure which is carried out on the ward or in an outpatient clinic. Part of the sample is sent to the laboratory to be examined under the microscope (histology) and part placed in special culture bottles to identify any infecting bacteria or fungi. How it will help In HIV it frequently helps to diagnose disseminated MAI infection or a lymphoma or rarely an unusual infection such as histoplasmosis. It can also help explain the cause of anaemia or other blood cell disorders. * Brain scan When and why This is carried out when doctors suspect or need to exclude a lesion or abnormality in the brain. It can, therefore, be one of a number of investigations into the cause of either persistent headache, confusion, fits memory problems or focal weakness in the arms or legs. This uses either computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dependent on the facilities available in the hospital. For both it involves lying flat and motionless within the scanning machine for approximately half an hour to an hour while the procedure is carried out. Occasionally sedation needs to be given. Having an MRI scan can for some people be a claustrophobic experience. If this might be a problem you should tell the radiologist. How it will help A brain scan is a very useful and essential test and can help to diagnose problems such as cerebral toxoplasmosis and lymphoma. A MRI scan can provide more detailed and clearer pictures of the brain may be more useful in making a diagnosis of either HIV encephalopathy or PML. Brain scans are also done to monitor the effect and response to treatment. * Bronchoscopy When and why A bronchoscopy can be part of the investigation into the cause of either a cough, breathlessness or an abnormal chest X-ray. A bronchoscope is a flexible tube containing optical fibres which allows the doctor to visualise and take tissue samples (biopsy) from the bronchial tree (breathing tubes) and lungs. Prior to the procedure the patient is given a light sedative and an injection to dry up the bronchial secretions. Using a local anaesthetic the bronchoscope is passed up through a nostril, down the back of the nose and throat, past the vocal chords and into the lungs. After the procedure the patient may feel drowsy for 3-4 hours and is asked not to eat or drink during this time as the throat and vocal cords have been numbed by the local anaesthetic. A-Z OF MEDICAL TESTS 297 [Page 298](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/304?q1=directories) How it will help Lung infections such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), tuberculosis or other bacteria can be more readily diagnosed and the correct treatment given. Kaposi's sarcoma can also be seen down a bronchoscope and may be the cause of a cough or breathlessness. SCD4 count When and why This test is an essential part of both the monitoring of the course of HIV infection over time and the response to treatment. In someone who is well and symptom-free then it is usually done 2-3 times a year, but in someone who is symptomatic it may be carried out more frequently to assess both the risk of opportunistic infections and response to anti-HIV drug treatments. A small sample blood is taken from a vein in the arm. The test measures the number of CD4 cells circulating in the blood, which is approximately only 2% of their total number in the body. The majority of CD4 cells are to be found in the lymph nodes. The CD4 cell is a special white blood cell that is targeted and infected by HIV. How it will help The CD4 count gives a measure of the degree of immunosuppression or damage to the immune system caused by HIV infection. Regular monitoring of the CD4 count can assess how quickly the immune system is being damaged, and helps to decide when certain treatments should be started. These include medications which reduce the risk of developing certain opportunistic infections (prophylaxis). It is important, however, to remember the CD4 count can be affected by acute infections, smoking, exercise and the time of day the blood test is taken. In addition, some people can remain and be very well despite having a low CD4 count and others can develop symptoms and problems despite having a higher CD4 count. Generally, the risk of severe symptoms of HIV disease tends to be high in patients with a CD4 count below 200 and especially for those with a count below 50. For more information on CD4 counts see Immunity and Disease * Cervical smear When and why It is routine for a woman to have a cervical smear every 3 years. In women with HIV infection it may be advisable to have this done more frequently. Apart from its use as a routine screening test it is also carried out if the cervix looks abnormal on examination or if there has been abnormal bleeding from the vagina. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and then using a special wooden spatula a sample containing cells from the surface of the cervix is smeared onto a glass slide. After special staining the slide is examined under the microscope to look for abnormal or cancerous cells. How it will help Regular cervical smears allow for the early detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix such as cancer or early changes which, if left could develop into cancer. In HIV there is some evidence that these changes may be more common especially if there is coinfection with the Human papilloma virus. If abnormalities are detected on a smear then a colposcopy is usually then carried out. * Creatinine clearance When and why This test measures kidney function and is usually carried out when either the results of certain blood tests suggest an underlying kidney disease or as part of the monitoring of a drug treatment which has possible toxic effects on the kidney (such as foscarnet). Over a 24 hour period all urine passed is collected in a bottle and then sent to the laboratory together with a blood sample taken at the same time to measure how well a substance called creatinine is excreted by the kidneys. How it will help This test provides information on how well the kidneys are working and if damaged determine whether a dose of a drug should be altered or discontinued. * Gastroscopy When and why This is usually carried out when symptoms suggest a problem in either the gullet (oesophagus), stomach or first part of the small bowel (duodenum). It may, therefore, be one of the investigations to find out the cause of stomach pains, difficulty with swallowing or suspected bleeding from the gut. A gastroscope is a flexible tube containing optical fibres which allows the doctor to see inside as the scope is passed down through the gullet and into the stomach. The test can be carried out as an outpatient without the need to be admitted to hospital. The patient needs to starve for 12 hours prior to the procedure to ensure the stomach is empty and to prevent vomiting. A mild sedative is usually given. How it will help In the presence of symptoms it can help to diagnose Candida or CMV infection in the oesophagus, duodenal ulcers and lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma. 298 A-Z OF MEDICAL TESTS [Page 299](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/305?q1=directories) * Karnofsky score This is not so much a test as an assessment of an individual's health and well-being based on a performance index of physical ability. It is often used in clinical research to monitor and record the health of patients. Karnofsky % Normal, no complaints 100 Able to carry on normal activities; minor 90 signs or symptoms of disease Normal activity with effort 80 Cares for self; unable to carry on normal 70 activity or to do active work Requires occasional assistance but able to 60 care for most of his needs Requires considerable assistance and 50 frequent medical care Disabled, requires special assistance 40 Severely disabled; hospitalisation 30 indicated although death not imminent Very sick; hospitalisation necessary; active 20 supportive treatment necessary Moribund 10 Dead 0 How it will help Cryptococcus and other causes of meningitis such as tuberculosis can be readily diagnosed and appropriate treatment started. Viruses which may be implicated in certain neurological problems such as PML can also be detected in samples of CSF and help confirm a diagnosis. These include CMV, herpes simplex virus and JC virus. Occasionally a lumbar puncture may be performed to assess the response to treatment for cryptococcal meningitis or to help confirm or exclude a clinical relapse. * Nerve conduction tests When and why These examine the normal function of peripheral nerves and detect whether there has been any damage either to the nerves or to the muscles they supply. There are, therefore, usually undertaken when someone complains of numbness, pins and needles or weakness in their legs or arms. The test measures the speed of an electrical impulse travelling down a particular peripheral nerve. Some people find this procedure uncomfortable but it is not normally painful and is routinely carried out as an outpatient procedure. How it will help The test helps to detect or define the presence and severity of damage to the peripheral nerves (peripheral neuropathy) and can give clues to their cause. * Neuro-cognitive tests When and why These are tests carried out by a clinical psychologist to help assess the severity and cause of cognitive symptoms such as forgetfulness, poor concentration and mental ability. The patient is asked to perform a series of mental tests which assess certain skills including language, the ability to recall or recognise information and the speed at which tests are performed. It is supervised by a clinical psychologist who scores the results and interprets the findings. How it will help The pattern of results helps differentiate the reason for memory and mental problems from between depression, anxiety and HIV-related dementia. The results are especially useful in detecting early changes of dementia, in advanced disease the test are often more difficult to carry out. * Sigmoidoscopy When and why A sigmoidoscopy can help to find out the cause of persistent diarrhoea or of abnormal bleeding from the lower bowel. It is commonly carried out when the results of stool cultures have not been able to identify the cause of diarrhoea. SLumbar puncture When and why A lumbar puncture is normally carried out to help diagnose meningitis (usually Cryptococcus) or certain viral infections that can cause neurological problems. It is an essential part of the investigation into the reason for a persistent headache and fever or other problems such as weakness and numbness in the legs. Under a local anaesthetic, a needle is inserted into the base of the spine and a small amount of cerebral spinal fluid removed. This procedure is normally done in an ordinary hospital ward and afterwards the patient is asked to remain lying flat for 4 hours to reduce the risk of a post-lumbar puncture headache. If swelling of the brain tissue is suspected clinically, then it is essential a brain scan is carried out first to ensure that a lumbar puncture is safe to do. A-Z OF MEDICAL TESTS 299 [Page 300](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/306?q1=directories) A sigmoidoscope (or colonoscope) is a flexible tube containing optical fibres which allows the doctor to see the lining of the bowel as it is passed up through the back passage into the rectum and colon. A laxative is given prior to the procedure to ensure that the views of the bowel are not obscured. Small pieces of tissue (biopsies) are normally taken from areas of the lining of the bowel which look abnormal and are sent off to the laboratory to be examined under a microscope. Alternatively, a rigid sigmoidoscope can be used for this procedure but can only be passed approximately 15 cm into the bowel and looks mainly at the rectum. How it will help The doctor can see whether there is any inflammation or ulceration of the rectum or colon or lesions which might be the cause of bleeding such as Kaposi's sarcoma. The biopsy specimens will help diagnose the cause of the diarrhoea which could be CMV colitis, Cryptosporidium, MAI infection or Microsporidium. SSpecimen culture When and why: These are essential tests to help diagnose the cause of an infection especially if the symptoms are fever, diarrhoea, cough and breathlessness. These tests involve placing specimens eg urine, stool, blood and sputum onto a special culture medium or plates which will allow any infecting organism such as bacteria, viruses or fungi to grow. If a bacteria is grown, the sensitivity of the organism can then be tested against various antibiotics to determine the right treatment. Apart from body fluids other specimens can be sent for culture such as a swab from an ulcer or samples of tissue (biopsy). How it will help There are many opportunistic or other infections that can occur in HIV and the ability to identify these is essential to confirm a diagnosis and to determine the right treatment. Sometimes it can be very difficult to identify the cause of a fever and multiple specimens are sent to the laboratory to try and culture the organism responsible. * Toxoplasma serology When and why This is a blood test which is normally done as part of the routine monitoring of HIV infection or helps support a diagnosis of toxoplasmosis (an opportunistic infection) in someone with advanced HIV disease. The test detects the presence of certain proteins (antibodies) in the blood which indicates a previous exposure to an infection with Toxoplasma. Antibodies are produced by the immune system in response to any infection. How it will help As the presence of antibodies indicates previous infection then someone who has severe damage to their immune system is at risk of re-activation. Knowledge of this risk allows treatments to be started which can prevent or reduce this risk (prophylaxis). Certain but not all drugs that are used to prevent PCP also have activity against toxoplasmosis and thus, the presence of antibodies to Toxoplasma in the blood should determine which is the most appropriate prophylactic agent. * X-ray & ultrasound When and why These are tests which can image different parts of the body and are, commonly used to investigate many and varied symptoms. Amongst the 2 most common imaging tests used in HIV infection are the chest X-ray and ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis. The chest X-ray is normally carried out when someone has symptoms of cough, breathlessness or chest pain. An ultrasound of the abdomen is useful in investigating the cause of abdominal pain, abnormal swellings and persistent fever. Simple x-rays and ultrasounds are quick to carry out and usually do not involve any injections or procedures that might cause any discomfort. An ultrasound simply involves a probe being moved around the surface of the abdomen and a chest X-ray standing in front of an X-ray machine as the film is taken. How it will help They provide essential information on the structure and form of internal organs and can identify abnormal lumps, swellings and masses. A chest X-ray can also provide information on the presence and severity of a pneumonia. 300 A-Z OF MEDICAL TESTS [Page 301](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/307?q1=directories) A to Z of Clinical trials SBeta-carotene & ascorbic acid Beta carotene and ascorbic acid are anti-oxidants. In the body beta carotene is converted into vitamin A; ascorbic acid is another name for vitamin C. Test-tube studies of ascorbic acid suggest that it may have both anti-HIV and anti-oxidant effects, although high doses may be required. Early trials of beta carotene have suggested that it might help to increase CD4 counts or boost other immune cells. This phase II study will test the effects of beta carotene and/or ascorbic acid on levels of HIV, CD4 count and micronutrient levels. Trial structure This is a randomised placebo-controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive EITHER beta carotene (30 mg/day) OR placebo plus EITHER ascorbic acid (500 mg/day) OR placebo. Participants will take the study treatments for 24 weeks and will then be followed for a further 6 weeks. Ascorbic acid does not cause side-effects at this dose level, which provides the current recommended daily amount of vitamin C. Beta carotene can be given at doses much higher than that used in this study without side-effects. Eligibility * HIV-positive * Must have a CD4 count above 50 * Must be aged 16 years old or older * Must not have a current opportunistic infection * Must not use other vitamin supplements during the study * Must not previously have received blood transfusions * Must not have started anti-retroviral treatment during the 12 weeks prior to entering the study.

This is known as hypocalcaemia. The body is usually able to correct hypocalcaemia itself by secreting a hormone called PTH, but this hormone is only released if levels of ionised magnesium in the blood are sufficiently high. Foscarnet therapy also leads to a reduction in ionised magnesium, thus preventing the body from correcting the hypocalcaemia. Hypocalcaemia can cause symptoms of nausea, tingling or less of feeling in the fingers and a tingling sensation around the mouth. This trial will examine whether taking calcium and magnesium supplements during foscarnet therapy helps to prevent hypocalcaemia and prevent these symptoms. Trial structure This is an 2-week open randomised pilot trial that will enrol 12 participants with CMV retinitis. Participants will be treated either with foscarnet alone, or with foscarnet plus the calcium and magnesium supplements for the first week. For the second week the groups will be swapped over, so those who were receving foscarnet alone will now also receive supplements, and those who were receiving the supplements will now receive foscarnet alone. Treatment with foscarnet will be continued for a third week if the CMV retinitis requires it. The supplements will be taken as 4 tablets at the start of the foscarnet infusions, ideally with breakfast or an evening meal. All participants will also receive one multivitamin tablet a day to ensure that everyone is receiving the baseline recommended daily vitamin amounts, which could otherwise affect their ability to absorb the calcium and magnesium supplements. Participants may be required to stay overnight in hospital on 3 or 4 occasions during the two week trial period. Blood will be taken 10 times during each such stay. Eligibility * Men and women aged 18 or over * Women must have a negative pregnancy test and be using adequate contraception. Breast-feeding mothers are excluded * Participants must not be experiencing any abdominal pains or be passing more than 3 stools per day * People with gastro-intestinal CMV or other gut infections are excluded * Participants must not be taking intravenous calcium antibiotics drugs that can cause kidney toxicity such as amphotericin B and intravenous co-trimoxazole * They must not have a history of serious drug allergies * They must not have blood abnormalities or have received a transfusion within 24 hours of joining the study * They must not have receiving the anti-CMV drug cidofovir (HPMPC) within the previous month, or any other experimental drug within the last week.

It also shows activity against other members of the herpes virus family such as 11/111 study will test the effectiveness of HPMPC for people with CMV retinitis who have failed to respond to standard drugs or have had to discontinue standard drugs because of side-effects. The study will also assess the side-effects of cidofovir. Prolonged use of cidofovir may cause kidney damage. It is also possible that allergic reactions to cidofovir could occur, such as rashes, as well as nausea and headaches. Trial structure This is a double-blind placebo-controlled Phase II/111 trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive cidofovir (5 mg/kg intravenously once a week for 2 weeks). They will then be randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy every week with cidofovir at a dose of either 3 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg. All participants will have their sight closely monitored by an ophthalmologist. During the first two months monitoring will take place every other week, then monthly indefinitely or until there are signs that the retinitis is progressing. If participants have to stop taking cidofovir, either because of lack of benefit or side-effects, they will be treated according to their doctor's best judgement. Urine and blood samples will be taken to measure levels of CMV. 302 A-Z OF CLINICAL TRIALS [Page 303](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/309?q1=directories) Eligibility * Participants must be diagnosed with AIDS-related CMV retinitis and aged between 13 and 60 years * They must be experiencing progression of their retinitis despite having been treated for at least 4 weeks with either ganciclovir or foscarnet, or the combination of the two drugs * They must not have received treatment with foscarnet or ganciclovir during the two days prior to joining the study * They must not have received treatment with vidarabine, amphotericin B, intravenous pentamidine, aminoglycoside antibiotics, CMV hyperimmune immunoglobulin, other drugs that may damage the kidney or other experimental anti-CMV drugs during the week prior to joining the study * They must not be receiving ongoing intravenous or oral acyclovir at the time of joining the study * They must not have taken cidofovir before * Women must be using adequate contraception and must not be pregnant or breast-feeding * Use of anti-HIV drugs and PCP prophylaxis is allowed, although AZT should be stopped or the dose halved on the day of cidofovir treatment * Must have relatively normal kidney, liver and blood functions * Must have a life expectancy of at least 3 months.

It also shows activity against other members of the herpes virus family such as the eye can cause lesions on the retina (retinitis) and results in blindness if left untreated. This Phase 11/111 study (known as protocol GS-93-106) will test the effectiveness of HPMPC for people who have peripheral CMV retinitis, i.e. CMV affecting the edges of the retina, where it is not currently sight-threatening. The study will examine whether HPMPC can prevent this peripheral retinitis from getting worse. The study will also assess the side-effects of cidofovir. Prolonged use of cidofovir may cause kidney damage. It is also possible that allergic reactions to cidofovir could occur, such as rashes, as well as nausea and headaches. Trial structure This is a double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 11/111 trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either immediate cidofovir (5 mg/kg intravenously once a week for 2 weeks, then once a fortnight), or delayed cidofovir. People in the delayed cidofovir arm will receive an inactive placebo unless their CMV retinitis shows signs of worsening, in which case they will be given cidofovir. If people in the immediate cidofovir arm show signs that their CMV retinitis is worsening, they will be switched over to standard anti-CMV treatment with the drugs foscarnet or ganciclovir. If any trial participant develops sight-threatening CMV retinitis, they will be switched immediately to standard foscarnet or ganciclovir treatment. All participants will have their sight closely monitored by an ophthalmologist. During the first two months monitoring will take place every other week, then monthly for 4 months, and then every 3 months. Urine and blood samples will be taken to measure levels of CMV. Eligibility * HIV-positive * Must be diagnosed with non-sight-threatening CMV retinitis * Use of anti-HIV drugs and PCP prophylaxis is allowed, although AZT should be stopped or the dose halved on the day of cidofovir treatment * Must not be receiving treatment with other drugs that may affect kidney function.

Clinicians have also reported subjective evidence that it may help to prevent a first episode of MAI in people with low CD4 counts, but no conclusive proof of this exists yet. This study is intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of clarithromycin for preventing MAI. The drug rifabutin has been approved for MAI prophylaxis; guidelines suggest that it should be offered to people with CD4 counts below 100. However, some researchers are concerned that its effectiveness is limited and that it has not been shown to improve survival, and thus are continuing placebo-controlled trials of other anti-MAl drugs. Trial structure This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day) or placebo for 104 weeks. If participants develop detectable MAI organisms in their blood or symptoms of MAI, they are given open label treatment. Monitoring takes place on day 1, day 8 and then every 4 weeks. Blood samples are taken, as well as faecal specimens to test for MAI organisms. Participants are asked to monitor their temperature and keep a diary card during the trial. In a few cases clarithromycin may cause gastro-intestinal problems, nausea, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness or abnormalities in liver function. Eligibility * HIV-positive * Must have a CD4 count of 100 or below * Must not have detectable MAI organisms in the blood during the 28-30 days prior to entering * Female participants must be on contraception.

An extension phase is underway to enable participants to continue to receive clarithromycin openly after the end of the study period. SDelavirdine (Part A) Delavirdine (previously known as U90152S) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor- an anti-HIV drug belonging to a different family of drugs from AZT, ddl and ddC, but which works by inhibiting the same viral enzyme. This pilot study is designed to investigate the safety and tolerance of three doses of delavirdine for people with symptomatic HIV disease who are already taking anti-HIV treatment using one or more of the nucleoside analogue drugs (AZT or AZT plus ddC). It will monitor how the drugs are absorbed, and to assess any antiviral effects as measured by CD4 count, plasma viraemia and levels of p24 antigen, serum Beta2 microglobulin Trial structure This is a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Participants who are taking AZT or AZT plus ddC are randomly allocated to take either delavirdine at a dose of (200 mg three times daily or 400 mg three times daily), or an inactive lookalike placebo. Each participant takes the trial capsules for 3 months. After the first 12 week phase, people who were allocated the placebo are offered delavirdine at a dose of 300 mg three times a day, and those originally assigned to delavirdine are able to continue to take it. Those who originally received 200 mg now receive 300 mg three times a day, and those originally on 400 mg three times a day continue on that dose. Thus all participants receive delavirdine at some point in the study. Delavirdine is a new drug, and only about 70 healthy volunteers and 40-50 people with HIV had ever taken it before this study began. Among them, no serious side effects have been seen using doses as high as 300 mg four times a day. One possible side effect is the appearance of a rash 10-14 days after starting treatment. The rash is like that which occurs in some people taking co-trimoxazole, and people who have had rashes from co-trimoxazole in the past may be at increased risk of developing a rash from delavirdine. People who develop a rash during the study stop taking delavirdine until it clears up, and then restart the drug, beginning at a dose of 50 mg three times a day for 7 days and doubling the dose each week until 400 mg 304 A-Z OF CLINICAL TRIALS [Page 305](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/311?q1=directories) three times daily is reached. This procedure usually solves any problems with rashes. Participants have to visit the clinic fortnightly during the screening period, weekly for the first month of the trial and once a month thereafter. Monthly check-ups include blood tests, cardiac rhythm tests and urine tests. Additional blood tests are performed on the first day of the trial and during the visits at weeks 4 and 12. Delavirdine is a product of Upjohn Ltd., which is coordinating this trial. Eligibility * ARC/AIDS * Must have been taking AZT alone or AZT plus ddC for at least 2 months prior to joining this trial, but not more than one year * Must not have used other experimental anti-HIV drugs during the 3 months prior to joining the trial * People who are currently using 'street' drugs are excluded, although people who are on a maintenance programme are eligible * Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded. No drug interaction tests with delavirdine have yet been performed. Participants must be sure to tell their doctor if they are taking other medications, as these could produce increased side-effects or change the way in which the body responds to the drugs. Four participants have been recruited at each centre.

This study is designed primarily to investigate the effectiveness of the drug in combination with AZT (a nucleoside analogue). Trial structure This is a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either delavirdine (300 mg three times a day) or a placebo. All participants also receive AZT at a dose of 600 mg/day. The trial lasts for 12 months. If at any time participants show signs of disease progression, they will start to take ddl or ddC in addition to AZT and delavirdine/placebo. Disease progression is defined as a CD4 count fall of more than 50%, or a 5% weight loss, or a decline by 30 points on the Karnofsky index. The major side effect seen with delavirdine is a rash.

It is possible that this is partly because HIV strains that are resistant to AZT develop, although the significance of resistance has not been proven. It has been suggested that combinations of these drugs may be more effective and less toxic. The study aims to assess combinations of AZT plus ddC or ddl in symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV infection both in terms of efficacy (improved survival and delay in the onset of AIDS or progressive HIV disease) and toxicity. It also aims to assess whether combinations of these drugs delay the onset of viral resistance. This trial is being conducted in association with centres in France, Holland, Italy, Australia and Switzerland. Similar trials attempting to answer slightly different questions are taking place in the USA and Scandinavia. Trial structure The trial will last for two years and volunteers are randomised to receive 600 mg of AZT daily PLUS: 200 mg of ddl twice daily in dispersible tablet form OR placebo which looks like ddl OR 0.75 mg of ddC three times daily in tablet form Charing Cross Hospital Dept of Genito-Urinary Medicine, Fulham Palace Road, London W6 8RF 0181-846 1577 Contact..........

One third of volunteers are allocated at random to receive AZT plus ddl, one third to receive AZT plus ddC and one third to receive AZT plus a placebo disguised to look like either ddl or ddC. Should a participant develop further progression of disease, they continue to take AZT and can be offered either ddl or ddC if they have previously been taking the placebo, or can change from ddl to ddC (or ddC to ddl) if they were taking active drugs during the blinded treatment phase of the trial. Disease progression will be defined by events as follows: * Severe ARC: CD4 count of less than 100; plus, for example, severe thrush and weight loss or diarrhoea * AIDS: as currently defined 306 A-Z OF CLINICAL TRIALS [Page 307](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/313?q1=directories) * Severe AIDS: a new AIDS event plus a CD4 count of less than 50. If a patient has severe PCP treated with intravenous pentamidine then the second drug or placebo will be suspended for the period of treatment. If any drug combination causes high levels of toxicity the International Coordinating Committee will review the dosages. Monitoring is conducted monthly for the first six months and thereafter bi-monthly. Two CD4 counts are taken at the beginning of the trial; subsequent monitoring consists of blood tests to monitor CD4 and p24, as well as tests to monitor for amylase levels (an indicator for the development of pancreatitis, which is a side-effect of ddl in some people). Possible side-effects include: anaemia, neutropenia, headache, nausea and vomiting with AZT; peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting and fits with ddl; peripheral neuropathy, mouth ulcers, nausea and rash with ddC. It is important to emphasise that pancreatitis may be life-threatening if not identified quickly and any abdominal pain should be treated with suspicion and reported without delay. Trial participants will be monitored for two years even if they stop taking the trial drugs. AZT is a licensed drug manufactured by The Wellcome Foundation Ltd. ddl is a product of Bristol-Myers Squibb. ddC is a product of Roche Products Ltd. Eligibility * HIV-1 positive * People with AIDS must have a CD4 count above 50 * People without symptoms must have a CD4 count below 350 * There is no restriction on CD4 count for people with ARC * Must be 15 years old, or older * Must have been on AZT for at least three months OR never taken AZT before * Must have no prior history of pancreatitis * Must not have any malignancy requiring combination chemotherapy * If female, must be using contraception throughout the trial, must not be pregnant or breast feeding.

During that time, mouth rinses can reduce the pain. Difflam is an oral rinse which has been used for many years as a treatment for painful conditions of the mouth such as sore gums, dental surgery and so on. This study will investigate its usefulness in reducing mouth pain in people with HIV. Trial structure This is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial comparing Difflam oral rinse with an inactive dummy solution. The trial lasts for one week. Participants must use the rinse at least three times a day before meals, but can use it as often as every one-and-a-half hours. Participants will also be given a rescue aspirin mouthwash to use if the trial solution is not working and the mouth pain becomes intolerable. Participants will be given a diary card on which to record the amount of pain they experience (pain assessment), the number of oral rinses used and the number of rescue aspirin rinses used. Participants will carry out pain assessments twice daily, on eating breakfast and evening meals, comparing the amount of pain they experience on an initial pain assessment on eating a mouthful of digestive biscuit. After the seven days, the doctor will assess the results of treatment and collect the diary card. Eligibility * HIV-positive people, aged 16 or over, of either gender * People with at least grade 1 oral mucositis according to the WHO mucositis rating scale * People who are receiving specific treatment for possible causes of mouth problems are excluded. 144 participants are required from between 12 trial centres.

However, its effectiveness as a treatment for other forms of CMV disease has not been clearly established. This study will compare the effectiveness of foscarnet to an inactive placebo in the treatment of AIDS-associated CMV infection of the upper and lower gastro-intestinal tract (CMV colitis). Foscarnet is a product of Astra Pharmaceuticals, who are sponsoring this trial. Trial structure This is a multicentre, double-blind placebo-controlled study that will run for 12 months. 72 participants are required. Participants will be treated with either foscarnet (90 mg/kg intravenously over 2 hours twice a day) or placebo for 5 days. If clinical symptoms have not improved after 5 days or the CMV colitis has progressed, the trial will end and participants will be treated openly according to their doctors best judgement. Blood tests and assessments will be made daily for three weeks.

It is normally made by CD4 cells - the cells which are depleted in people with AIDS. It is therefore theorised that giving HIV-positive people supplementary injections of gamma interferon may help them to resist infections. The trial is using a type of gamma interferon called Immukin, produced by the pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim. It is a licensed product for treating other immune deficiency diseases. Trial structure This is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive.either gamma interferon injections (50 g/m2) three times a week or a matching, inactive placebo. Participants will be taught how to inject themselves at home. The study will last 12 months. The effectiveness of gamma interferon will be assessed by comparing the number of infections and tumours and overall survival in the treated group with the placebo group. Quality of life test results and laboratory measures of immune function will also be examined. Monitoring will require visits to the clinic every 4 weeks. Participants will also be asked to keep a diary card to record any side-effects from the treatment. Possible side-effects of gamma interferon are 'flu-like symptoms such as fever, joint pains and headaches. Trial participants will be able to continue to receive gamma interferon after the study has been completed. 308 A-Z OF CLINICAL TRIALS [Page 309](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/315?q1=directories) Eligibility * HIV-positive * Must have a CD4 count below 100 on at least two occasions * Must be aged over 18 * Must not have had an active opportunistic infection within the last 4 weeks * Must not have used other trial medications (apart from trials of AZT, ddl and/or ddC) within the last four weeks * If you used to take anti-HIV drugs but have now stopped, you must have been off the drug(s) for at least 8 weeks * Sexually active women must be using contraception; pregnant women are excluded. 80 participants are required.

SImiquimod Imiquimod is a drug that, when given as capsules, stimulates the immune system to produce interferon, a natural chemical which helps the body to fight viruses. Anogenital warts are caused by a virus called the human papilloma virus (HPV), and severe cases are sometimes treated by injecting them with interferon. Other available treatments include applying drugs such as podophyllin and techniques such as freezing with liquid nitrogen. In HIV-negative people, imiquimod has been shown to clear up warts. This study is the first to test the cream in HIV-positive people, looking primarily at its safety but also at its effectiveness. Imiquimod cream can cause side-effects of redness, swelling, hardening under the skin, wearing away of the top skin layers, blisters, ulcers, scabbing, pain, burning and itching. Imiquimod capsules have also caused symptoms such as tiredness, temperature, muscle aches, joint pain and malaise, which are thought to be a result of the body producing interferon. These flu-like side-effects are thought to be unlikely with the cream formulation. Trial structure This is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either imiquimod cream or placebo cream, to be applied to the warts at bedtime three times a week, and washed off after 8 hours. Two-thirds of trial participants will receive imiquimod and one-third will be given placebo. Participants will be asked to keep a diary detailing how much cream they use, any side-effects and details of other medications. The study will last up to 16 weeks, during which participants will have to attend the clinic 11 times. Each person's warts will be counted, measured and photographed at each visit. People whose warts get worse or whose HIV disease progresses, or who suffer serious side-effects, may be withdrawn from the study. Eligibility * HIV-positive * Men and women are eligible; women must not have significant abnormalities on pelvic examination or evidence of cervical cancer * Must be diagnosed with genital warts * Must not be using any other topical wart treatment during the study or the 4 weeks before entry * During the 4 weeks before entering the study, and throughout its duration, must not be receiving treatment with interferon, drugs that induce interferon, immunomodulator, antiviral drugs (other than AZT, ddl, ddC or acyclovir tablets), cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs or experimental drugs * During the 2 weeks before entering the study, and throughout its duration, must not be receiving treatment with oral or inhaled corticosteroids, interferon, drugs that induce interferon, or other treatments applied directly to the wart area e.g. antifungal creams * Women must be using adequate contraception.

SIsoprinosine vs oxpentifylline One approach to treating HIV/AIDS is to try to improve the immune system's response to HIV and other infections with drugs called immunomodulators. This trial compares two different immunomodulators. Oxpentifylline and isoprinosine have been in common use for other diseases for some time and their side-effects are well known. Trial structure This is an unrandomised open-label trial, which means that doctors and patients will know which drug a participant is receiving. Participants will receive either 400 mg of oxpentifylline four times daily or 1 g of isoprinosine four times daily. Originally this trial had a third arm studying imuthiol but this has been terminated as a result of the drug's withdrawal by the manufacturer. Oxpentifylline is a product of Hoechst Pharmaceuticals. Inosine Pranobex is a product of Leo Laboratories. This trial is sponsored by the Pasteur Suite of Ealing Hospital. Eligibility * HIV-positive * Pregnant women are excluded * Must be over 18 years of age. Trial site Ealing Hospital Pasteur Suite, Uxbridge Road, Middlesex UB1 3HW 0181-967 5555 Contact..................Dr Stephen Ash Status The trials is closed to recruitment and ongoing. * Itraconazole People with HIV and reduced immune function become vulnerable to a range of fungal infections, some of which are 'superficial' (near the surface or exterior of the body, such as candida in the mouth), but infections can also be 'deep' such as candida in the throat. Itraconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal drug which belongs to the -azole family of drugs, which also includes fluconazole and ketoconazole. It has a low incidence of side-effects. This trial will study the effectiveness of itraconazole compared with placebo for preventing first episodes of 'deep' fungal infections (i.e. as primary prophylaxis) and will assess any effect on survival. The prophylaxis of 'superficial' fungal infections and any effect on CD4 count will also be measured. Itraconazole is manufactured by Janssen. Trial structure The trial is a randomised multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled study. Two weeks before beginning the study, potential participants will stop taking any other anti-fungal drugs and be given blood tests for CD4 count, liver function and (for women) pregnancy. On entering the study participants will be randomly assigned to take either itraconazole (two 100 mg capsules once daily with a meal), or placebo. The trial will last for 2 years. Participants will have to visit the clinic every 8 weeks for monitoring. It is important to tell your doctor about any other tablets you are taking including ones bought over-the-counter in chemists (especially hayfever treatments and antacids) as these can affect the absorption of itraconazole. People who develop fungal infections while in the trial will be offered treatment with ketoconazole tablets or miconazole oral gel or vaginal cream. If the infection responds to this treatment within two weeks (for oral or vaginal candida) or four weeks (for oesophageal candida) they will be eligible to continue in the study. If not, they will be withdrawn from the trial. Side-effects from itraconazole are rare but can include minor stomach upsets (sickness, indigestion, stomach pains), headaches, dizziness and occasion allergic reactions and changes in liver function. Itraconazole is a product of Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which is sponsoring this trial. Itraconazole is also available from the manufacturer on a named patient basis. A total of 156 participants is required in the UK. Eligibility * HIV-positive men and women with CD4 counts below 300 are eligible. People with counts below 200 must be receiving PCP prophylaxis * Must be over 18 years of age * Women must be using contraception. Pregnant women are excluded * People with certain liver problems are excluded * People with a fungal infection on entry, or who have a history of systemic fungal infection such as candida in the oesophagus, are excluded * People who have previously had a fungal infection which did not respond to -azole therapy or who are allergic to -azole drugs are excluded * People may not begin the trial within 14 days of previous systemic (i.e. pills as opposed to ointments) anti-fungal treatment 310 A-Z OF CLINICAL TRIALS [Page 311](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/317?q1=directories) must taking terfenadine, astemizole or warfarin.

Trials to date have suggested that 3TC has some anti-HIV activity, although this may be modest. It seems to be the least toxic of the nucleoside analogue drugs - no significant side-effects have been observed to date. Previous studies have suggested that taking a combination of nucleoside analogue drugs (combination therapy) may be more effective than taking one nucleoside analogue alone (monotherapy). However, there is little data yet available about the particular combination of 3TC plus AZT. Laboratory tests suggest that 3TC may be able to make AZT-resistant strains of HIV sensitive to AZT again. The combination of the two drugs may therefore be able to delay or prevent the development of resistance. This study is taking place at 10 centres throughout Europe. It is a Phase II study designed to compare the safety and effectiveness of the combination of 3TC plus AZT with that of standard AZT monotherapy. Glaxo 3TC Information Line: 081-966 2196 Trial structure This is a multi-centre double-blind placebo-controlled study which will last for one year. All participants receive AZT at a dose of 200 mg three times daily. During the first 6 months of the study, people who have taken no more than 4 weeks prior AZT are randomly assigned also to take lamivudine (300 mg twice daily) or a placebo. People who have taken at least 26 months prior AZT are randomly assigned also to take lamivudine at at dose of either 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg twice daily. During the second 6 months, everyone is switched to open label combination therapy i.e. people who were previously receiving AZT plus placebo now receive AZT plus 3TC. Thus everyone in the study is guaranteed that they will receive at least 6 months' treatment with the combination. Monitoring takes place fortnightly during the first month and monthly thereafter. Blood tests including full blood counts and CD4, p24 antigen, plasma viraemia and PCR are assessed, and a full physical examination is given at each visit. No serious side-effects have been seen in previous studies of 3TC: minor toxicities may include headache, nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea and rash. Adverse reactions to AZT may include neutropenia (low white cell count), anaemia, nausea and headaches. 3TC is a product of Glaxo Group Research, which is sponsoring the trial. AZT is a licensed drug manufactured by Wellcome. It is not yet known whether 3TC will be available after the trial. Eligibility * Participants must be over 18 years old, HIV-positive with a CD4 between 100 and 400 * Participants must have received either no more than 4 weeks prior AZT, or at least 26 weeks prior AZT * People who have been diagnosed with a malignancy other than KS are ineligible * No use of cytotoxic drugs is permitted during the 30 days prior to entering the trial * People taking treatment for active tuberculosis are ineligible.

A shortage of neutrophils (neutropenia) can be caused by some treatment drugs such as AZT, ganciclovir or cytotoxic chemotherapy for KS or lymphoma. This study will establish the minimum dose of lenograstim needed to enable people who develop neutropenia while receiving ganciclovir treatment for CMV retinitis to continue to take the optimum dose of ganciclovir. Lenograstim can cause side-effects of bone or muscle pain and pins-and-needles at the injection site. Trial structure This is an international, multicentre dose-ranging Phase Ila study. Participants who are receiving ganciclovir (10 mg/kg/day for 21 days) as treatment for CMV retinitis will be randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous injections of lenograstim at a dose of either 150, 100, 50 or 25 g/m/day, or an inactive placebo. Treatment will be administered either in the clinic on an outpatient basis by a doctor or nurse, or at home by a standard home care service. Participants will not be able to self-administer the trial injections. The researchers will assess the average dose of ganciclovir that participants are able to receive during the 21 days of treatment, the degree to which participants experience neutropenia, the functioning of their neutrophils and their quality of life. Participants will keep a daily record of their temperature, side-effects and any pain at the injection site. Blood will be taken twice a week. People who experience continuing neutropenia during the study will be offered one of four options: to receive open-label lenograstim (150 g/m/day); to switch to foscarnet; to receive a reduced dose of ganciclovir; or to receive intravitreal ganciclovir (injected into the eye). Eligibility * Participants must be aged 18 or over and diagnosed with an initial case or a recurrence of CMV retinitis * Must have a neutrophil count below 1000 * Must not take AZT during the study, and must not be receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy or foscarnet. All other treatments are permitted * Must not be intolerant of ganciclovir * Must not have intercurrent bacterial infection, PCP or toxoplasmosis * Must not have received prior treatment with colony stimulating factors or other cytokines. Trial site Kobler Centre Charing Cross Hospital 369 Fulham Road, London 0181-846 6182 Contact............. Sandra Davies * Liposomal daunorubicin currently used in the treatment (KS) include bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin and vincristine. However, the usefulness of these drugs is limited by their toxicity. Because daunorubicin is so toxic, pharmacologists have been trying to develop ways of targeting KS so that the drug has fewer side-effects on the rest of the body. The liposomal form of daunorubicin is wrapped up in a fatty coat, which keeps the drug stable in the bloodstream. However, tumour capillaries are abnormally leaky compared to capillaries in healthy tissue and this enables the liposome to enter the tumour where the active drug is released. The drug has been shown to be effective in reducing the number of lesions and slowing the progression of KS in up to 60% of people with previously treated KS, with only mild toxicities. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of liposomal daunorubicin in the treatment of early KS (less than 20 lesions with or without oral lesions). Trial structure This is a crossover design, open-label trial with two initial stages of 12 weeks each, followed by an open treatment phase of undetermined length. Participants will be divided into two groups, A and B, and will be treated as follows: Group A: Weeks 1-12: liposomal mg/m ) Mild bone marrow suppression may occur, and the dose of liposomal daunorubicin will be modified if necessary. Monitoring will consist of clinical evaluations every fortnight, with laboratory assessment of liver and kidney function and the full blood count. Participants will be withdrawn from the study if there is a greater than 50% increase in the number or size of KS lesions, or if serious toxicity occurs (Grade 3 as defined by the ACTG). Participants will be able to receive the drug after the trial has finished. Liposomal daunorubicin is a product of Vestar Inc., which is sponsoring this trial.

SLiposomal doxorubicin open label study This drug is a formulation of the drug doxorubicin used in the treatment of KS. The liposomal form of doxorubicin is wrapped up in a fatty coat, which keeps the drug stable in the bloodstream. However, tumour capillaries are abnormally leaky compared to capillaries in healthy tissue and this enables the liposome to enter the tumour where the active drug is released. This formulation of the drug produces fewer side-effects than conventional doxorubicin in cancer patients. Trial structure This is an open label study to provide liposomal doxorubicin to people who are not eligible for the trial comparing the drug with conventional chemotherapy. It is not a placebo controlled trial. All participants will receive intravenous doses of 20 mg/m2 of liposomal doxorubicin every 3 weeks for 60 weeks, i.e. 20 doses. The drug will be administered during a half-hour infusion in the out-patients clinic. Treatment will be stopped early for participants who experience a complete response to treatment i.e. all KS lesions resolve. Monitoring will consist of blood tests every visit, regular photographs of KS lesions to assess changes (or X-ray or fibre-optic endoscope examination of internal lesions), and a chest X-ray at the beginning and end of the study. Liposomal doxorubicin is a product of Liposome Technology Inc who are sponsoring this study. The drug will be available to participants after the study has ended. Eligibility * HIV-positive * Must be aged over 18 * Must have proven KS which is progressing on the skin, or which is affecting internal organs * Must not be eligible for the Liposomal doxorubicin vs conventional chemotherapy trial * Must not have received chemotherapy or interferon within the last 4 weeks * Must not have received radiotherapy within the last 3 weeks * Must not have any other active infection which requires treatment with drugs that are toxic to the bone marrow * Must not have major heart disease * Sexually active women must be using contraception; pregnant women are excluded 500 participants are required.

However, tumour capillaries are abnormally leaky compared to capillaries in healthy tissue and this enables the liposome to enter the tumour where the active drug is released. This formulation of the drug produces fewer side-effects than conventional doxorubicin in cancer patients, and this study is intended to compare the toxicity and effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin with that of conventional A-Z OF CLINICAL TRIALS 313 [Page 314](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/320?q1=directories) chemotherapy with the drugs vincristine and bleomycin, in the treatment of KS. Trial structure This is an open label drug comparison trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: liposomal doxorubicin (20 mg/m2 intravenously) intravenously) plus vincristine (1.4 mg/m2 intravenously) every three weeks. Participants will receive 6 cycles of treatment over an 18-week period. Response to treatment will be assessed by observing the size and number of lesions and the severity of KS-related symptoms. The side-effects associated with bleomycin, vincristine include bone marrow inhibition causing anaemia and a decreased white blood cell count. The standard form of doxorubicin can impair the bone marrow and impair heart function, but these side-effects are thought to be unlikely with the liposomal version which is being used in this study. Liposomal doxorubicin is a product of the Liposome Technology Inc. Trial participants will be able to obtain the drug after the study has ended. People who are not eligible for this study can enrol in the liposomal doxorubicin open label study described overleaf. Eligibility * HIV-positive * Must have at least 15 KS lesions on the skin or mucous membranes OR 6 new lesions during the last month OR at least 5 skin lesions plus lesions in the internal organs * Must not have received chemotherapy or interferon within the last 4 weeks * Must not have received radiotherapy within the last 3 weeks * Must not have any other active infection which requires treatment with drugs that are toxic to the bone marrow * Must not have major heart disease * Must not have peripheral neuropathy * Must not have a history of adverse reactions to any of the study drugs * Sexually active women must be using contraception; pregnant women are excluded. 220 participants are required.

This Phase I/I11 trial will measure the effects of Lithium-GLA on the amount of HIV in participants' bloodstream (viraemia). Lithium-GLA has previously been shown to improve survival in people with cancer of the pancreas, without causing significant side-effects. In some people, however, it caused inflammation of the blood vessels and minor disruption of red blood cells; these side effects were easily controlled by thinning the blood and reducing the dose. Lithium-GLA is manufactured by Scotia Pharmaceuticals under the tradename Efamol. Trial structure This is a open study using intravenous Lithium-GLA. Participants will be given the drug by drip, along with heparin to thin the blood, over a 10-15 day period. People who have a Hickman line wil! be treated using it; others will have a special 'long-line' catheter inserted into their arm. Participants will be treated as hospital in-patients. Blood samples will be taken every day during the trial, and on a monthly basis indefinitely after the end of the trial. Physical examination of any KS lesions and body weight, plus quality of life assessments, will also be performed. Eligibility * Male or female, any race * Must have late stage AIDS * Participants should preferably have KS lesions of the skin * Must be aged between 18 and 80 * Must have detectable HIV viraemia (by p24 antigen and/or PCR detection of viral material) * Must have no anti-retroviral treatment for a month prior to joining the study * Must not be receiving treatment with foscarnet * Must not be receiving other systemic lithium salts, or known to be allergic to lithium salts * Pregnant women are excluded. 314 A-Z OF CLINICAL TRIALS [Page 315](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/321?q1=directories) Trial sites Charing Cross Hospital Dept of Genito-Urinary Medicine, Fulham Palace Road, London W6 8RF 0181-846 1577 Contact................

SLoviride Loviride belongs to the non-nucleoside class of anti-HIV drugs which act against HIV's reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. In phase I/11 studies of drugs such as loviride, nevirapine and L-697,661, viral resistance to the drugs developed quite quickly at low doses, although high doses of nevirapine avoided this to some extent. However, treatment of AZT-resistant virus strains with these non-nucleoside RT inhibitors makes those strains sensitive to AZT again. This study is designed to compare the effects of AZT, loviride and the combination of the two. Trial structure This is a randomised, double-blind trial with a placebo-controlled phase. Each participant will be in the trial for 6 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: * Group A: loviride (100 mg three times daily) plus AZT-lookalike placebo * Group B: AZT (200 mg three times daily) plus loviride-lookalike placebo * Group C: loviride plus AZT * Group D: Placebo for 3 months, switching to loviride for the last 3 months. Adverse effects from these doses of AZT are rare, but may include anaemia, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, headache and myopathy. No significant side effects have been noted from ioviride. Monitoring will take place every two weeks for the first two months, and monthly thereafter. It will consist of standard blood tests for markers of HIV disease progression, such as CD4 cell count and CD4 percentage. Close virological and immunological monitoring will be performed. Participants will be withdrawn from the trial if they are diagnosed with AIDS. All participants will be offered combination loviride and AZT at the end of the study. Loviride is a product of Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which is coordinating this trial. Eligibility * Must have non-AIDS defining symptomatic HIV disease * Must have a CD4 count between 350-500 and no prior use of AZT, OR must have a CD4 count between 200-350 and no prior anti-retroviral treatment except AZT (which must have been stopped 1 month before entering this trial) * Must be aged 18 years old or older * Must not be receiving concurrent treatment with -azole (anti-fungal) drugs, barbiturates or rifampicin (for TB or MAI) * Pregnant women are excluded. 120 participants are required.

SOctreotide Octreotide is an analogue of the drug somatostatin, which has been shown to be helpful against diarrhoea associated with a number of diseases. A number of studies have suggested that it may also be of value in the treatment of diarrhoea in people with HIV. Octreotide has to be given by injection. The main reported side-effects are local and gastrointestinal. Local reactions include pain (stinging, burning or tingling) at the injection site, with redness and swelling. They rarely last more than 15 minutes. Gastrointestinal side-effects include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating and flatulence. These may be reduced by avoiding meals around the time of octreotide administration. Formation of gallstones has been reported in people taking long-term octreotide therapy. The aim of this study is to investigate the initial response to octreotide and its longer term effectiveness and tolerability in those who respond, compared to placebo. Trial structure This is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Participants will be randomised to receive three 200 g subcutaneous A-Z OF CLINICAL TRIALS 315 [Page 316](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/322?q1=directories) injections per day of octreotide or an identical placebo for a two week period. All participants will then receive octreotide for a further three months with the option to stop therapy after a further two weeks if no measurable efficacy is seen. Enrolment will continue until 40 participants have completed the first 4 weeks of the study. Thereafter if participants withdraw from the study for any reason, new participants will be enrolled. Monitoring will consist of daily records of the number of bowel movements for the first four weeks, and weekly records for the remainder of the study period. Stool volume will be measured weekly for the first four weeks and fortnightly thereafter. Participants' weight, arm circumference and skin fold thickness will also be measured weekly during the study period and fortnightly during the follow-up period. Octreotide is a product of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, which is sponsoring this trial. Eligibility * HIV antibody positive * Must have clinical features of AIDS or HIV infection as defined by the CDC classification * Must have diarrhoea (at least 1 litre of stool volume per day) for at least 1 month which has been clinically unresponsive to conventional antidiarrhoeal therapy (eg. codeine) given for at least one week * Must not have had previous treatment with octreotide, or with experimental anti-diarrhoea drugs during the previous month * Must not have evidence of underlying immunosuppressive disease other than due to HIV * Must not have evidence of non-HIV related gastro-intestinal disorders known to cause diarrhoea * Current injecting drug users are excluded * Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded * People with gallbladder disease are excluded.

After an episode of CMV retinitis has been stabilised with intravenous ganciclovir, long-term maintenance therapy is required to prevent the condition from progressing further. Three studies to date have suggested that the capsules are approximately as effective as the intravenous drug in delaying the progression of CMV retinitis in people who have already received treatment with intravenous ganciclovir. Preliminary evidence from one of these trials suggests that oral ganciclovir doses of 6 g/day (1000 mg six times a day) may be more effective in delaying progression than 3 g/day (500 mg six times a day). This study will compared the effectiveness of 30 weeks' treatment with oral ganciclovir doses of 3 g/day or 6 g/day for people whose retinitis has already been successfully stabilised with intravenous ganciclovir. Detailed information on the side-effects of oral ganciclovir is only known for the 3 g/day dose. The most serious side-effect is neutropenia - a shortage of the neutrophil white blood cells which fight bacterial and fungal infections. Neutropenia has occurred in 18-40% of people treated with 6 g/day but is less common at 3 g/day. Other side-effects may include stomach upsets and flatulence. Trial structure This is a multi-centre, randomised, double blind dose comparison study. Participants assigned to receive 30 weeks' treatment with either oral ganciclovir at a dose of either 500 mg six times a day, or 1000 mg six times a day. This amounts to 24 capsules every day; half of the capsules given to people in the 3 g/day group will contain an inactive placebo. Participants have to return to the clinic every fortnight for check-ups. Photographs will be taken of the retina and blood samples will be taken for laboratory tests. People who experience progression of retinitis despite taking oral ganciclovir will be offered intravenous treatment. Eligibility * HIV-positive * Must have CMV retinitis that has been successfully treated and stabilised with intravenous ganciclovir * Use of anti-HIV drugs and PCP prophylaxis is allowed, although ganciclovir may increase ddl absorption, possibly resulting in an increased risk of ddl toxicities such as peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis * Must not be receiving treatment with other drugs that may affect kidney function.

Studies of its effectiveness are still underway, but results to date suggest that it may be almost as effective as intravenous ganciclovir in preventing relapses in CMV retinitis in people who have already been successfully treated with the intravenous drug. This study is intended to provide access to oral ganciclovir to people who are unable to take intravenous ganciclovir or intravenous foscarnet because they cannot have a permanent catheter implanted. It will also gather information on the safety of oral ganciclovir and the time to progression of CMV retinitis. Trial structure This is an open label study. Participants will receive oral ganciclovir at a dose of 1000 mg to be taken three times a day with meals. People who experience progression of their CMV retinitis or develop CMV in other parts of their body while taking oral ganciclovir should be treated intravenously, but may then continue to take oral ganciclovir maintenance therapy at this dose or at a doubled dose of 6000 mg/day. Participants will need to visit the clinic at weeks 2 and 4 after starting treatment, and monthly thereafter. They will receive a physical check-up and an ophthalmological examination. The study will continue to enrol participants until two months after oral ganciclovir is licensed and becomes commercially available in Britain or its development is discontinued. The trial will end two months after enrollment is stopped. Eligibility * Participants must be aged 18 or over and using adequate contraception * They must have had CMV retinitis that has stabilised following standard intravenous treatment * They must be unable to maintain a permanent implanted catheter or the use of such a catheter must be medically contraindicated because of infection, thromosis or a neuropsychiatric disorder which gives rise to increased problems with catheters * They must not be allergic to ganciclovir or acyclovir * They must not have digestive problems such as chronic diarrhoea or malabsorption * They must not be using other anti-CMV agents * ddl should not be taken at the same time as oral ganciclovir. Status This programme is now available subject to ethics committee approval at individual clinics. * p24.VLP at low CD4 counts Several studies have demonstrated a significant correlation between declining levels of antibodies to p24, an HIV core protein, and increasing risk of the development of symptoms in healthy HIV-positive people. This suggests that the immune response to p24 may be important in maintaining a symptom-free state. p24.VLP is a hybrid 'virus-like particle' which includes the p24 and p1 7 protein parts of HIV, but none of the rest of the virus. The theory is that it may prompt the immune system to produce greater antibody and/or T-cell responses against these viral proteins; it is hoped that these in turn may prolong the asymptomatic phase. Trial structure This is a phase II dose-ranging double-blind placebo controlled trial taking place at three centres in London, plus centres in Australia. It will last one year. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either p24.VLP at a dose of 500 g or 1 mg, or a placebo that looks like p24.VLP. The treatment will be given by intramuscular injection at 4-week intervals, until each participant has received 6 injections. They will then be followed for a further 32 weeks, during which their immune responses will be monitored at monthly intervals by standard blood tests. The development of opportunistic infections, disease progression and survival will also be monitored. Some local pain and redness at the site of the injection may occur, and participants may also experience a mild, short-term fever after injections. Participants will be asked to record any side effects in a diary. Participants who were A-Z OF CLINICAL TRIALS 317 [Page 318](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/324?q1=directories) randomised to receive placebo will be able to receive p24.VLP after the trial if the data establishes that it is effective. p24.VLP is a product of British Bio-technology Ltd., which is sponsoring and coordinating the trial. Eligibility * HIV-1 antibody positive with a CD4 count less than 350 on two occasions * Must currently be receiving no anti-HIV treatment.

It is a double-blind placebo controlled trial taking place at European centres. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either p24.VLP at a dose of 100 g, 500 g or 1 mg, or a placebo that looks like p24.VLP. The treatment will be given by intramuscular injection at four-week intervals, until each participant has received six injections. They will then be followed for a further 28 weeks, during which their immune responses will be monitored at monthly intervals by standard blood tests eg. CD4 count, p24 antibody levels, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity, viral load. Some local pain and redness at the site of the injection may occur, and participants may also experience a mild, short-term fever after injections.

It has therefore been theorised that neutralising antibodies might protect against the development of AIDS. Passive immunotherapy involves removing plasma (the part of the blood which includes antibodies) from healthy persons who have a high CD4 count. The plasma from several donors is then pooled and treated to make sure that it is free from infectious viruses. It is then infused into other HIV-positive people. Structure Recipients will receive antibody infusions once monthly on an outpatient basis at the trial site. The study is of unlimited duration, and is an open, unblinded study with no placebo. Participants will be withdrawn from the study if no obvious benefit is apparent after consultation with the trial physician. No adverse reactions are expected. This is a study rather than a formal trial, and is being sponsored and coordinated by Ealing Hospital. Eligibility Donors must be HIV-1 positive with CD4 count of over 500 and high levels of neutralising antibodies. Recipients must be: * HIV-1 antibody positive * Must have a CD4 count between 100 and 300 * Aged over 18. There are no other exclusion criteria. There is no limit on study numbers.

When it has been metabolised by the body, it acts against the HIV enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is essential for the virus to reproduce. AZT is helpful for children with symptomatic HIV infection. It results in improved immune function, weight gain and neurological function. As with adults, less is known about whether using AZT before symptoms appear is beneficial. This trial is for children with vertically acquired HIV infection who have minimal or no symptoms of HIV disease and is intended to determine whether early treatment with AZT, compared with treatment which is deferred until later in the disease, is more useful in delaying progression to AIDS and prolonging life. It will also investigate the development of AZT resistance in children. Trial structure This is a randomised double blind placebo-controlled trial. Children with mild or no symptoms of HIV disease may be entered. If a child develops symptoms, or if for other reasons (e.g. falling CD4 count) the pediatrician feels that AZT is definitely required, he/she may then be transferred from trial drug (AZT or placebo) to open AZT, but will continue to be followed up. Thus, no child will be deprived of AZT should it be required. The dose of AZT will be 600 mg/m/day in syrup form, or matching placebo, given three times a day. Monitoring will take place at 2, 4 and 8 weeks and then twelve weeks after commencing the trial, and subsequently every twelve weeks. Hamatology, T-cell subsets, immunoglobulin, and virus levels/resistance will be measured from blood tests. Adverse reactions which could occur in some participants include neutropenia (low white cell count), anaemia, nausea and headaches. These reactions seem to be much less common in children than in adults and are also not expected to be so common in children with mild HIV disease. They are reversible on stopping the drug. Blood transfusions will be used if a reduced dose of the drug fails to reduce anaemia. Note that in this trial, other preventative measures such as intravenous immunoglobulin (which helps prevent bacterial infection) and PCP prophylaxis are allowed.

SPENTA 3 AZT and ddC are nucleoside analogue drugs which all inhibit replication of HIV in a similar way. AZT is helpful for children with symptomatic HIV infection. It results in improved immune function, weight gain and neurological function. However, these benefits are limited and are not maintained indefinitely. It is possible that this is partly because HIV strains that are resistant to AZT develop, although the significance of resistance has not been proven. It has been suggested that combinations of these drugs may be more effective and less toxic. The study aims to compare the combination of AZT plus ddC to monotherapy with AZT alone in children with symptomatic HIV infection who have never taken anti-HIV drugs before. It will look at the safety and tolerance of the combination, and provide preliminary information on its antiviral effects. However, the aim is not to repeat the large-scale efficacy trials that are taking place in adults, but to provide information to enable researchers to extrapolate from those adult studies. Trial structure This is a randomised double blind placebo-controlled trial. Children can be enrolled if they have developed HIV-related symptoms and the paediatrician feels that antiviral treatment is definitely required, but is uncertain whether to treat with one or two anti-HIV drugs. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either: AZT (600 mg/m/day in syrup form, given three times a day) plus ddC (0.03 mg/kg/day in syrup form, given three times a day) OR AZT (600 mg/m/day in syrup form, given three times a day) plus an inactive placebo that looks like ddC, three times a day. Monitoring will take place at 4 week intervals. Each child will be followed for at least 26 weeks. Adverse reactions from AZT which could occur in some participants include neutropenia (low white cell count), anaemia, nausea and headaches. These reactions seem to be much less common in children than in adults. They are reversible on stopping the drug. Possible side-effects of ddC are neuropathy (damage to the nerves in the hands and feet), skin rashes, mouth ulcers and pancreatitis. These are reversible on stopping the drug.

It contains all the necessary nutrients that a person needs to consume each day. It is believed to be effective at preventing weight loss and reducing damage to the intestines in people with HIV who have diarrhoea. This trial will test the effectiveness of RAP for people with AIDS who are experiencing weight loss and wasting following diarrhoea. Trial structure The trial will compare RAP with another food product, Ensure, and with normal food. Eligible participants will first be asked to stop taking any nutritional supplements they currently use and to complete a record of their nutritional intake for the next 7 days. A small bowel biopsy will then be performed using a fibre-optic endoscope, as well as other baseline tests. They will then be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1: Normal food Group 2: No food except Ensure (5-9 cans per day) Group 3: No food except RAP (5-9 cans per day) Participants receiving solely the nutritional product may choose to receive the product either by mouth, by a nasogastric tube or by a gastronomy tube. After 8-12 days another examination, including a small bowel biopsy, will be performed, with a third examination and biopsy 14 days later at the end of the study. Eligibility * Men and women with AIDS aged between 18 and 60 * Must have a CD4 count of 400 or below * Must not take any other nutritional supplements within 7 days of joining the study, or during the study * Must have had 3 or more bowel movements a day for the last 5 days * Must have body weight which is 10-30% below the ideal weight * Must not have any metabolic disorders or be using drugs that can affect metabolism e.g. Megestrol acetate, lithium, steroids * Must not have significant liver or kidney disorders.

SSaquinavir, AZT & ddC Saquinavir is a protease inhibitor. Protease (or proteinase) is the name of the enzyme that HIV uses when it replicates within a cell to break up large viral proteins into smaller ones from which new virus particles can be made. Protease inhibitors have been shown to slow down the replication of HIV in the test tube. Because HIV protease is only created by infected cells and has no normal function in the body, drugs that act specifically against it are unlikely to harm normal cells. Trials to date suggest that saquinavir on its own may lead to CD4 count increases similar to those seen with AZT and may reduce levels of HIV in the body. In combination with AZT, these effects may be more pronounced. No trials have yet established whether these effects result in clinical benefits such as delayed disease progression or improved survival. The only side-effects seen from saquinavir to date are occasional headache and lightheadness. This study will assess whether saquinavir treatment does result in clinical benefits, how the drug compares to AZT, and whether the combination is better than either AZT alone or saquinavir alone. 322 A-Z OF CLINICAL TRIALS [Page 323](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/329?q1=directories) Saquinavir is manufactured by Roche Products Ltd.

Sandra Davies * Saquinavir open label study Saquinavir is a protease inhibitor. A trial of combinations of saquinavir, AZT and ddC is currently underway in the UK. This study (known as protocol SV14563) is intended to provide continued access to saquinavir for people who have completed earlier studies of the drug or who had to drop out of earlier studies for reasons other than the development of side-effects thought to be due to saquinavir itself. Its aim is to assess the long-term safety of saquinavir, to make the benefits of saquinavir available to people with HIV, and to monitor the appearance of AIDS defining events in people who dropped out of earlier trials due to adverse events. Trial structure Participants in this study will receive saquinavir at a dose of 600 mg every 8 hours. They will be assessed after 4 weeks treatment and then every 12 weeks. The study will continue until saquinavir is licensed and commercially available or until its development is discontinued. Participants are permitted to take any other medications. Eligibility Participants must have completed an earlier study of saquinavir or discontinued for reasons other than side effects of saquinavir itself. Women must be using adequate contraception. Status This programme is now available subject to ethics committee approval at individual clinics. * Stavudine Stavudine is a member of the nucleoside analogue family of anti-HIV drugs, which includes AZT, ddl and ddC. These work by inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme. Like ddl, stavudine appears to produce short-lived increases in the CD4 count (early data suggest that these are greater with stavudine than with ddl) and also has the common side-effect of peripheral neuropathy. Stavudine has been approved for use in the USA by people who cannot tolerate or who have experienced disease progression despite taking other anti-HIV therapies. This parallel track study makes stavudine available in the UK. Trial structure This is an open label, randomised, compassionate use protocol. Participants will receive either a lower dose or a higher dose of stavudine, which will be adjusted to take account of their body weight: People who weigh over 60 kg: * higher dose - 40 mg twice a day * lower dose - 20 mg twice a day North Manchester General Hospital Monsall Regional AIDS Unit, Delaunays Road, Manchester M8 5RB 0161-720 2729 Contact...........

On entering the study participants will have a physical check-up and blood tests will be performed. This monitoring will be repeated at monthly intervals. Possible risks of taking stavudine include peripheral neuropathy (painful damage to the nerves in the hands and feet), liver enzyme abnormalities, nausea at higher doses, shortage of platelets in the blood (granulocytopenia) and, possibly, pancreatitis. Stavudine is metabolised in the body in a very similar way to AZT, so if AZT and stavudine are taken at the same time there is a risk that one or both will not be absorbed properly.

It has therefore been suggested that it might be possible to prevent progression of disease by suppressing this immune activation. Thalidomide has been shown to suppress this activation in test-tube experiments. The drug was first licensed in Europe in 1958 as a treatment for morning sickness and insomnia in pregnant women, but was withdrawn from the market after it was demonstrated in 1960 that it caused the birth defect phocomelia in a proportion of the women's children. Since then it has been used sparingly for the treatment of certain skin problems and ulcers. The risk of phocomelia means that it must never be used by women who may be pregnant. Other side-effects include drowsiness and, after prolonged use, a risk of irreversible neuropathy (tingling, numbness or pain in the hands and/or feet due to nerve damage). Trial structure This is a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either thalidomide (100 mg daily to be taken at night), or an inactive placebo which looks like thalidomide, for a total of 24 weeks. Neither you nor your doctor will know whether you are receiving real thalidomide or the placebo. You will have to attend the clinic once a month for the 24 week period for an examination and blood tests. In addition, nerve conduction tests will be performed at 12-weekly intervals to check for any signs of nerve damage due to thalidomide. Eligibility * Men only. No women will be admitted to this trial * HIV-positive but not diagnosed with AIDS * Must have a CD4 count over 400 * Must not have used anti-HIV drugs * Must have high blood levels of neopterin and Beta2-microglobulin.

It also inhibits human cells when given on its own, but this harmful effect can be effectively prevented by another drug, leucovorin. The PCP organisms cannot take up leucovorin, so remain vulnerable to trimetrexate. Phase III studies comparing trimetrexate plus leucovorin to standard treatment with co-trimoxazole have shown that trimetrexate is better tolerated, but somewhat less effective. It has been licensed in the USA for people who cannot tolerate standard treatment. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of trimetrexate plus leucovorin for people with moderate to severe PCP who are intolerant of co-trimoxazole. The administration of leucovorin is vitally important. Trimetrexate can cause fatal bone marrow damage if it administered without leucovorin. Leucovorin will be continued for 3 days after trimetrexate treatment is completed. Possible side-effects of the two-drug regime include blood toxicities (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), liver test abnormalities, kidney toxicity and, rarely (usually only when adequate leucovorin is not given), inflammation or ulceration of mucous membranes. Trial structure This is an open, non-comparative trial. Participants will be hospitalised and treated with trimetrexate (45 mg/m2 daily by intravenous infusion plus infusions of leucovorin every 6 hours. Trimetrexate will be administered for a maximum of 21 days. Daily monitoring will take place. Steroids will also be administered during the first 10 days of treatment. Other trials have established that this improves treatment for moderate-to-severe PCP. The main endpoint of the trial will be survival 21 days after treatment is begun. Other measurements will include time until successful treatment, relapse and longer term survival rates. Trimetrexate is a product of UK Biosciences Ltd. Eligibility * Must have a definite diagnosis of PCP within the last 15 days * Must be intolerant of co-trimoxazole or be non-responsive to co-trimoxazole treatment, either during the current episode or during previous PCP treatment or prophylaxis * Must be aged 18 years old or older * Must not have a history of severe allergy to trimetrexate * Must not be taking drugs that inhibit the bone marrow (e.g. anti-HIV drugs or cytotoxic chemotherapy), unless the individual is willing to discontinue them during the trial * Women must have a negative pregnancy test, must not be breast-feeding and must use adequate contraception.

In test-tube studies it has proved to be more effective against candida and other fungal infections such as Cryptococcus and Aspergillus than the widely used anti-fungal fluconazole. This trial will assess the effectiveness, safety and toleration of UK-109,496 as a treatment for acute invasive aspergillosis in people with HIV. Trial structure This is an open-label trial comparing different doses of UK-109,496. People who have just been diagnosed with definite or probable aspergillosis but have not yet begun treatment are eligible, as well as people who definitely have aspergillosis but have failed to respond or have become intolerant to treatment with other antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B. Initially, participants will receive intravenous treatment with 2 loading doses of 6 mg/kg UK-109,496 12 hours apart, followed by a further 6 days of intravenous treatment at a dose of 3 mg/kg twice daily, and then further treatment with capsule-form UK-109,496 at a dose of 200 mg twice daily for a total duration of 4-24 weeks. This dose will be reduced to 100 mg twice daily for people who weigh less than 40 kg. If this regime seems to be safe and well-tolerated but not sufficiently effective in at least 10 participants, people enrolled subsequently will be treated with higher doses.

No serious side-effects from UK-109,496 have been reported. However, people taking high doses have reported visual disturbances (pages of newspapers looked brighter, light appeared brighter and blurred vision). These side-effects decreased when the dose was reduced and disappeared when the drug was stopped altogether. UK-109,496 is a product of Pfizer, who also manufacture fluconazole. Eligibility * HIV-positive * Must be aged between 14 and 65 * Both men and women are eligible * Must be diagnosed with definite or probable acute invasive aspergillosis but have not yet begun treatment, or have definite acute invasive aspergillosis but have failed to respond or have become intolerant to treatment with other antifungal drugs * Must not be taking other experimental drugs except ddl, ddC or haematopoietic growth factors * Must not be taking any other systemic antifungal drug * Must not have had a previous allergic reaction to other -azole antifungal drugs * Must not be using other substances that might interfere with drug metabolism in the liver e.g. barbiturates, steroids, erythromycin, cimetidine and others (although some exceptions are allowed - ask for details) * Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding (pregnancy tests will be performed as part of monitoring).

This study is the UK arm of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) trial 204, intended to find out whether oral valaciclovir can prevent the development of serious disease due to cytomegalovirus (CMV). A recent study has shown that acyclovir does not prevent CMV disease in people with advanced HIV disease. However, the study did show a significant survival benefit in the acyclovir group; furthermore, high doses of acyclovir have been shown to have an effect in reducing the incidence of CMV disease in people following kidney and bone marrow transplant operations. As valaciclovir achieves higher blood levels of acyclovir than the standard form of oral acyclovir, the study will investigate whether valaciclovir can prevent CMV disease in people with advanced HIV infection. The oral acyclovir doses should suppress herpes simplex infections, although past trial results suggest that they are unlikely to prevent CMV disease. The trial will compare valaciclovir to two doses of acyclovir. Because there is some evidence that acyclovir may prolong life in people with advanced HIV disease, the study will also compare the benefits of acyclovir and valaciclovir in improving survival. Trial structure This trial is a double-blind drug and dose comparison trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with either: * 2 g of valaciclovir four times a day * 800 mg of acyclovir four times a day * 400 mg of acyclovir twice a day. Participants in each group will also be given placebo tablets mimicking the drugs in the other treatment groups; this amounts to 18 tablets a day. Monitoring will take place every four weeks for the first two months, and then once every 8 weeks for the rest of the study. Participants will continue to take the study group for one year after the last person is recruited. As well as a questionnaire, routine blood tests will be performed at each visit to determine any side effects of the drugs and to measure blood levels of acyclovir. Some blood will also be frozen for future testing of CMV and HIV. Every 2 months urine samples will be taken for CMV culture testing. Physical examinations, including eye tests, will be repeated every 6 months. Any participant who develops CMV disease during the study will be withdrawn from the trial and given appropriate treatment.Other reasons for withdrawal from the trial include drug toxicity, the development of herpes infections or the development of resistance to acyclovir or ganciclovir. 326 A-Z OF CLINICAL TRIALS [Page drugs (AZT, ddl and/or ddC), PCP prophylaxis and other treatments is allowed, with the exception of other treatments which could affect CMV (see below). Participants who develop shingles or herpes sores may take acyclovir. Valaciclovir is a pro-drug of acyclovir, which in general causes few side effects. Possible mild side-effects are nausea, vomiting and headaches. In very high doses acyclovir can cause abnormalities in liver and kidney tests, tremors and confusion. All these side effects get better quickly when the drug is stopped. Valaciclovir will still be made available to participants when the trial has finished.

AIDS-related complex A term used to describe some of the signs and symptoms that a person with HIV may experience, without the opportunistic infections or tumours that constitute a diagnosis of AIDS. The term usually indicates that a person has mild or moderate loss of immune function. It is not a very useful phrase as it does not have a strict definition and for this reason the term is going out of use. AIDS test An inaccurate term often used of the HIV antibody test. It carries the false implication that a positive result means that someone has developed AIDS, when in reality the majority of people living with HIV are asymptomatic. alkaline phosphatase An enzyme released by the liver as a result of damage caused by infection or drugs; a useful blood test for diagnosing liver problems. allopathic A term used by homeopaths and other practitioners of complementary medicine to describe conventional western medical practice.

It is therefore necessary to rely on other indirect evidence, which is inevitably less accurate, such as numbers and types of infections and body weight;.laboratory indicators such as CD4 counts, neopterin and beta 2 microglobulin levels; p24 antigen and antibody levels. symptomatic Having symptoms. syncytium Dysfunctional clump of CD4 cells which forms around an HIV-infected CD4 cell in vitro. syndrome A group of symptoms and diseases that together are characteristic of a specific condition. synergy The interaction of two or more drugs that produce or enhance an effect which is greater than adding together the separate effects of the two drugs. systemic Having an activity throughout the body. T4 cell A type of cell in the human immune system with CD4 receptors which is damaged in the course of HIV disease. See CD4. TAT A protein encoded by HIV which regulates the transcription of viral DNA into RNA. Drugs that inhibit TAT are being developed. T-cells (T-lymphocytes) A thymus-derived white blood cell that participates in a variety of cell-mediated immune reactions. Three fundamentally different types of T-cells are recognized: helper, killer, and suppressor (each has many subdivisions). teratogenic Causing physical defects in the foetus. therapeutic index Ratio between the desired effect of a compound and an undesired side-effect. A high therapeutic index is sought in drugs to minimise the likelihood of side effects. therapeutic vaccine A vaccine-like product used with the aim of improving the immune functioning of someone who already has an infection, rather than of preventing the infection. thrombocytopenia A decreased number of blood platelets, cells important for blood clotting. GLOSSARY 397 [Page 398](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/404?q1=directories) thrush A fungal infection of the mouth, throat or genitals caused by candida, marked by white patches. thymus A lymphoid organ in the upper chest cavity where T cells develop, it tends to disappear or become rudimentary in adults. tid Three times a day. tiw Three times a week. titre A laboratory measurement of the amount (or concentration) of a given component in solution. T-Lymphocyte See T-cells. TNF See tumour necrosis factor. tonsils Two oval lymphoid glands situated where the mouth joins the throat. topical On the surface (usually the skin). toxicity The extent or the ways in which a drug is poisonous to the body. toxin A poisonous substance. See endotoxin. toxoplasmosis A disease due to infection with the protozoa Toxoplasma gondii, frequently causing inflammation of the brain). Occasionally toxoplasmosis may also involve the heart, lung, adrenal, pancreas, and testis. transaminase An enzyme that can be measured in a blood sample that indicates the health of the liver. transfer factor A fraction of white blood cells that apparently 'transfers' capability to mount an immune response to a specific antigen. Treatment IND A US programme to provide experimental treatments to a class of patients lacking satisfactory alternative treatment. tricyclic antidepressant A type of drug with sedative effects, usually used to treat depression and associated symptoms. tumour necrosis factor (TNF) A cytokine produced mainly by macrophages, which can affect the behaviour of important immune cells such as T-cells and B-cells, and plays an important role in countering infections and tumours. TNF is often found at abnormally high levels in people with HIV; at these high levels it is thought that TNF can lead the immune system to attack healthy body cells, and may cause symptoms such as weight loss and wasting. ulcer A break in skin or mucous membrane which involves the loss of the surface tissue. vaccine A substance that contains antigenic components from an infectious organism. By stimulating an immune response (but not disease), it protects against subsequent infection by that organism. variable region The part of an antibody or antigen's structure that differs from one antibody/antigen to another. varicella zoster virus See herpes zoster. vertebrate Having a backbone or spinal column. viral culture A laboratory method for growing viruses. viral load The amount of virus in the blood. viraemia The presence of virus in the blood stream. virion A virus particle existing freely outside a host cell. virology The study of viruses and viral disease. virucidal (virucide) See antiviral. virulence The power of a bacterium or virus to cause disease. It can be measured by the ease with which the organism is transmitted from person-to-person, the speed at which it moves through the body, and/or the extent of the harmful effects it causes. Different strains of the same micro-organism can vary in virulence. virus A microscopic germ which cannot reproduce itself outside the living cells of the organism that it infects. Viruses can divert cells from their normal functions and thus damage or destroy them. visceral Of or pertaining to the internal organs. white blood cell count A laboratory test to establish the numbers of white blood cells in a blood sample. White blood cells, which include lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, macrophages and monocytes, are the cells of the immune system. The white blood cell count can be lowered by HIV infection, by opportunistic infections or by various drugs. wild type virus Virus of the type found in infected people, as opposed to laboratory strains. window period The time between HIV entering a person's body and the person making antibodies to HIV. This is usually around two months, but in a significant number of people may take several months longer. zalcitabine Generic name for ddC, an antiretroviral drug. zidovudine Generic name for AZT, an antiretroviral drug. 398 GLOSSARY [Page 399](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0094.007/405?q1=directories) Index 1592U89, 100 Acupuncture, 223 Acyclovir, 101 inhibition of CMV, 51
