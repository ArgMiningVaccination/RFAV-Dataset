They do not fully describe the benefits coverage for your health and welfare plans. For details on the benefits coverage, please refer to the plan's Evidence of Coverage. The Evidence of Cov erage or Summary Plan Description is the binding document between the elected health plan and the member. A health plan physician must determine that the services and supplies are medically necessary to prevent, diagnose, or treat the members' medical condition. These services and supplie s must be provided, prescribed, authorized, or directed by the health plan's network physician unless the member enrolls in the PPO plan where the member can use a non -network physician. The HMO member must receive the services and supplies at a health pla n facility or skilled nursing facility inside the service area except where specifically noted to the contrary in the Evidence of Coverage. For details on the benefit and claims review and adjudication procedures for each plan, please refer to the plan's E vidence of Coverage. If there are any discrepancies between benefits included in this summary and the Evidence of Coverage or Summary Plan Descriptio n, the Evidence of Coverage or Summary Plan Description will prevail.

Who can enroll ? If you are a regular full time employee that is regularly working a minimum of 20 hours per week for the University , you are eligible to participate in the benefits program. Eligible employees may also choose to enroll family members, including a legal spouse/registered domestic partner (as legally defined under state and local law) (hereinafter referred to as \"registered domestic partner\") and/or eligible children. An employee may be unable to pay for and/or receive employer contributions on a pre -tax basis for the cost of the benefits of an employee's state registered domestic partner that does not meet the definition of the employee's tax dependent under IRC Section 152. When does coverage begin ? Regular, full -time employees: You are eligible to enroll on your date of hire, but your coverage begins the first of the month coinciding with or following your date of hire. Your enrollment choices remain in effect through the end of the benefits plan year, (January 1, 2023 - December 31, 2023 ). If you miss the enrollment deadline, you may not enroll in a benefit plan unless you have a change in status event during the plan year. Please check with your pla n administrator and your Section 125 plan document on any applicable status change events that would allow you to make a mid -year election change . Log into Workday and click on your Open Enrollment inbox item. Guides may be found under the Benefits app in Workday. If you have questions when completing your enrollment forms, contact Human Resources . How do I get started with my enrollment? 6 What if my needs change during the year? You are permitted to make changes to your benefits after the open enrollment period if you have a change in status event as defined by the IRS. Generally, you may add or remove dependents from your bene fits, as well as add, dr op, or change coverage if you submit your request for change within 30 days of the status change event. Change in status examples include: Marriage, divorce or legal separation. Birth or adoption of a child. You or your spouse's loss or gain of coverage through our organization or ano ther employer. Death of a dependent. An employee (1) was expected to average at least 2 0 hours of service per week, (2) has a change in employment status where he/she will reasonably be expected to average less than 20 hours of service per week (even if he/she remains eligible to be enrolled in the plan); and (3) intends to enroll in another plan that provides Minimum Essential Coverage (no later than the first day of the second month following the month of revocation of coverage). You enroll, or intend t o enroll, in a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) through the State Marketplace or Federal Exchange due to open enrollment or special enrollment period, and coverage is effective no later than the day immediately following the revocation of your employer -sponsore d coverage. If your change during the year is a result of the loss of eligibility or enrollment in Medicaid, Medicare or state health ins urance programs, you must submit the request for change within 60 days. For a complete explanation of status change eve nts, please refer to the \" Santa Clara University document that reflects employer's permitted status change events (e.g. Section 125 document)\" contents. Do I have to enroll ? Although the federal penalty requiring individuals to maintain health coverage has been reduced to $0, some states have their own state -specific individual mandates . To avoid paying the penalty in some states, you can obtain health insurance through our benefits program or purchase coverage elsewhere, such as from a State or Federal Health Insurance Exchange. For information regarding Healthcare Reform and the Individual Mandate, please contact Human Resources or visit www.cciio.cms.gov . You can also visit www.coveredca.com to review information specific to the Covered California Stat e Health Insurance Exchange. You may elect to \"waive\" coverage if you have access to coverage through another plan. To waive coverage , you much submit a completed Health Insurance Waiver Form with proof of coverage to Human Resources. If you elect to waive your medical coverage, the University will contribute $75 per pay period. It is important to note that if you waive our medical coverage, you must maintain medical/health coverage through another source. It is also important to note that if coverage is wa ived, the next opportunity to enroll in our group benefit plans would be January 2024 , unless a change in status event occurs. 7 Medical 8 Medical Which plan type is right for you?

Out -of-network coverage is not available except in the case of an emergency. A High -Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) combines traditional medical coverage with a Health Savings Account (HSA). As evident by t he name, this plan has a higher deductible you must reach before the plan kicks in. Advantages Lower out -of-pocket costs . Care coordinated by PCP . Tax advantages with an HSA. Out-of-pocket costs Both copays and coinsurance are generally a lower out -of-pocket expense than a PPO plan. Your out -of-pocket expenses may be mostly upfront, since you'll need to satisfy your deductible before your plan kicks in. Ideal if... ... you prefer a lower payroll deduction and are comfortable with a PCP directing your care. ... you don't usually need much care throughout the year, this plan might be right for you.

Primary Care Physician Referral Specialist In-network Using an HMO Using a HDHP Primary Care Physician Specialist or HSA Funds In-network or Out -of-network 10 Prescription Drug (Rx) Benefits Many FDA -approved prescription medications are covered through the benefits program. Tiered prescription drug plans require varying levels of payme nt depending on the drug's tier. Generic formulary (Tier 1): Generic drugs contain the same active ingredients as their brand -name counterparts but are less expensive. Brand name m edications (Tier 2): A brand -name medication can only be produced by one specified manufacturer and is proven to be the most effective in its class. Non-formulary prescriptions (Tier 3): Although you may be prescribed non -formulary prescriptions, these types of drugs are not on the insurance company's preferred formulary list. This is because there is an alternative proven to be just as effective and safe, but less costly. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for additional information regarding the generic option. Specialty p rescriptions (Tier 4): Specialty medications most often treat chronic or complex conditions and may require special storage or close monitoring. Why pay more for prescriptions? Use Mail Order Save time and money by utilizing a mail order service for maintenance medications. A 90-day supply of your medication will be shipped to you, instead of a typical 30 -day supply from a walk -in pharmacy. Go to www.kp.org or www.blueshieldca.com to sign-up for mail order delivery service. Shop Around Some pharmacies, such as those at warehouse clubs or discount stores, may offer less expensive prescriptions than others . Call ahead to determine which pharmacy provides the most competitive price. Over -the-Counter Options For common ailments, over-the-counter drugs may provide a less expensive alternative that serves the same purpose as prescription medications. 11 \"I need specific medical care!

Enclosures: Medicare Part D Creditable Coverage Notice HIPAA Special Enrollment Rights Notice HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Notice Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA) Notice Newborns' Mothers Health Protection Act (NMHPA) Notice General Notice of COBRA Continuation Rights These are ad ditional notices that may be appropriate based upon an employer's circumstances. We included the Surprise Billing Notice to assist with an employer's obligation to post the notice on its website. HIPAA Privacy Notice of Availability ACA Grandfathered S tatus Notice Surprise Billing Notice - \"Your Rights and Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills\" Should you have any questions regarding the content of th e notices, please contact Human Resources . 42 Medicare Part D Creditable Coverage Notice Important Notice from Santa Clara University About Your Prescription Drug Coverage and Medicare Please read this notice carefully and keep it where you can find it. This notice has information about your current prescription drug coverage with Santa Clara University and about your options under Medicare's prescription drug coverage. This information can help you decide whether or not you want to join a Medicare drug plan. If you are considering joining, you should compare your current coverage, includ ing which drugs are covered at what cost, with the coverage and costs of the plans offering Medicare prescription drug coverage in your area. Information about where you can get help to make decisions about your prescription drug coverage is at the end of this notice. There are two important things you need to know about your current coverage and Medicare's prescription drug coverage: 1. Medicare prescription drug coverage became available in 2006 to everyone with Medicare. You can get this coverage if you join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or join a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) that offers prescription drug coverage. All Medicare drug plans provide at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare. Some plans may also offer more cov erage for a higher monthly premium. 2. Santa Clara University has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by the Santa Clara University Group Benefit Plan is, on average for all plan participants, expected to pay out as much as standard Medica re prescription drug coverage pays and is therefore considered Creditable Coverage. Because your existing coverage is Creditable Coverage, you can keep this coverage and not pay a higher premium (a penalty) if you later decide to join a Medicare drug plan. When Can You Join A Medicare Drug Plan? You can join a Medicare drug plan when you first become eligible for Medicare and each year from October 15th to December 7th. However, if you lose your current creditable prescription drug coverage, through no fault of your own, you will also be eligible for a two (2) month Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to join a Medicare drug plan. What Happens To Your Current Coverage If You Decide to Join A Medicare Drug Plan? If you decide to join a Medicare drug plan whi le enrolled in Santa Clara University coverage as an active employee, please note that your Santa Clara University coverage will be the primary payer for 43 your prescription drug benefits and Medicare will pay secondary. As a result, the value of your Medica re prescription drug benefits may be significantly reduced. Medicare will usually pay primary for your prescription drug benefits if you participate in Santa Clara University coverage as a former employee. You may also choose to drop your Santa Clara Un iversity coverage. If you do decide to join a Medicare drug plan and drop your current Santa Clara University coverage, be aware that you and your dependents may not be able to get this coverage back. When Will You Pay A Higher Premium (Penalty) To Join A Medicare Drug Plan? You should also know that if you drop or lose your current coverage with Santa Clara University and don't join a Medicare drug plan within 63 continuous days after your current coverage ends, you may pay a higher premium (a penalty) to join a Medicare drug plan later. If you go 63 continuous days or longer without creditable prescription drug coverage, your monthly premium may go up by at least 1% of the Medicare base beneficiary premium per month for every month that you did not ha ve that coverage. For example, if you go nineteen months without creditable coverage, your premium may consistently be at least 19% higher than the Medicare base beneficiary premium. You may have to pay this higher premium (a penalty) as long as you have M edicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you may have to wait until the following October to join. For More Information About This Notice Or Your Current Prescription Drug Coverage... Contact your Human Resources Department for further information NOTE: You'll get this notice each year. You will also get it before the next period you can join a Medicare drug plan, and if this coverage through Santa Clara University changes. You also may request a copy of this notice at any time. For More Information About Your Options Under Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage... More detailed information about Medicare plans that offer prescription drug coverage is in the \"Medicare & You\" handbook. You'll get a copy of the handbook in the mail ever y year from Medicare. You may also be contacted directly by Medicare drug plans.

Date: [ Insert MM/DD/YY] Remember: Keep this Creditable Coverage notice. If you decide to join one of the Medicare drug plans, you may be required to provide a copy of this notice when you join to show whether or not you have maintained creditable coverage and, ther efore, whether or not you are required to pay a higher premium (a penalty). 44 Name of Entity/Sender: Santa Clara University Contact : Human Resources Address: 500 El Camino Real Santa Clara, CA. 95053 45 HIPAA Special Enrollment Rights Notice If you are declining enrollment in Santa Clara University group health coverage for yourself or your dependents (including your spouse) because of other health insurance or group health plan coverage, you may be able to enroll yourself and your dependents in this plan if you or your dependents lose eligibility for that other coverage (or if the employer stops contributing toward your or your dependents' other coverage). However, you must request enrollment within 30 d ays (60 days if the lost coverage was Medicaid or Healthy Families) after your or your dependents' other coverage ends (or after the employer stops contributing toward the other coverage).

However, you must request enrollment within 30 days after the marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.

Model General Notice of Cobra Continuation Coverage Rights ** CONTINUATION COVE RAGE RIGHTS UNDER COBRA** Introduction You're getting this notice because you recently gained cov erage under a group health plan (the Plan). This notice has important information about your right to COBRA continuation coverage, which is a temporary extension of coverage under the Plan. This notice explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may be come available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect your right to get it. When you become eligible for COBRA, you may also become eligible for other coverage options that may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. The right to C OBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you and other members of your family when group health coverage would otherwis e end. For more information about your rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, you should review the Plan's Summary Plan Description or contact the Plan Administrator. You may have other options available to you when you lose group he alth coverage. For example, you may be eligible to buy an individual plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace. By enrolling in coverage through the Marketplace, you may qualify for lower costs on your monthly premiums and lower out -of-pocket costs. Additionally, you may qualify for a 30 -day special enrollment period for another group health plan for which you are eligible (such as a spouse's plan), even if that plan generally doesn't accept late enrollees. What is COBRA continuation coverage? COBRA continuation c overage is a continuation of Plan coverage when it would otherwise end because of a life event. This is also called a \"qualifying event.\" Specific qualifying events are listed later in this notice. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage m ust be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary.\" You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifying event. Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage. If you're an employee, you'll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events: Your hours of employment are reduced, or Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. If you're the spouse of an employee, you'll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events: Your spouse di es; Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced; Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or You become divorced or legally sep arated from your spouse. Your dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events: 1 https://www.medicare.gov/sign hours of employment are reduced; The parent -employee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; The parent -employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B, or both); The parents become divorced or legally separated; or The child stops being eligibl e for coverage under the Plan as a \"dependent child.\" When is COBRA continuation coverage available? The Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred. The employer must notify the Plan Administrator of the following qualifying events: The end of employment or reduction of hours of employment; Death of the employee; The employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both). For all other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), you must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the qualifying event o ccurs. You must provide this notice anyone covered under the Plan who are spouses, dependent children, or anyone eligible for COBRA continuation under the plan. How is COBRA continuation coverage provided? Once the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered employees may elect COBRA continu ation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. COBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage that generally lasts for 18 months due to employment termination o r reduction of hours of work. Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of coverage, may permit a beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of coverage. There are also ways in which this 18 -month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended: Disability extension of 18 -month period of COBRA continuation coverage If you or anyone in your family covered under the Plan is determined by Social Security to be disabled and you notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, you and your entire family may be entitled to get up to an additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 29 months. The disability would have to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation c overage and must last at least until the end of the 18 -month period of COBRA conti nuation coverage. Second qualifying event extension of 18 -month period of continuation coverage If your family experiences another qualifying event during the 18 months of C OBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent children in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if the Plan is properly notified about the second qualifying event. This extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children getting COBRA continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies; becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); gets divorced or legally separated; or if the depe ndent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a dependent child. This extension is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurr ed. Are there other coverage options besides COBRA Continuation Coverage? Yes. Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) , or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse's plan) through what is called a \"special enrollment period.\" Some of the se options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov . Can I enroll in Medicare instead of COBRA continuation coverage after my group heal th plan coverage ends? In general, if you don't enroll in Medicare Part A or B when you are first eligible because you are still employed, after the Medicare initial enrollment period, you have an 8 -month special enrollment period1 to sign up for Medicare Part A or B, beginning on the earlier of: The month after your employment ends; or The month after group health plan coverage based on current employment ends. If you don't enroll in Medicare and elect COBRA continuation coverage i nstead, you may have to pay a Part B late enrollment penalty and you may have a gap in coverage if you decide you want Part B later. If you elect COBRA continuation coverage and later enroll in Medicare Part A or B before the COBRA continuation coverage e nds, the Plan may terminate your continuation coverage. However, if Medicare Part A or B is effective on or before the date of the COBRA election, COBRA coverage may not be discontinued on account of Medicare entitlement, even if you enroll in the other p art of Medicare after the date of the election of COBRA coverage. If you are enrolled in both COBRA continuation coverage and Medicare, Medicare will generally pay first (primary payer) and COBRA continuation coverage will pay second. Certain plans may pa y as if secondary to Medicare, even if you are not enrolled in Medicare. For more information visit https://www.medicare.gov/medicare -and-you.

Plan contact information Human Resources 500 El Camino Real Santa Clara, CA. 95053 HIPAA Notice of Availability of Notice of Privacy Practices The Santa Clara University Group Benefit Plan (Plan) maintains a Noti ce of Privacy Practices that provides information to individuals whose protected health information (PHI) will be used or maintained by the Plan. If you would like a copy of the Plan's Notice of Pri vacy Practices, please contact Human Resources. Grandfathe red Plan Status Notice If your group health plan is grandfathered then the following will apply. As permitted by the Affordable Care Act, a grandfathered health plan can preserve certain basic health coverage that was already in effect when that law was en acted. Being a grandfathered health plan means that your plan may not include certain consumer protections of the Affordable Care Act that apply to other plans, for example, the requirement for the provision of preventive health services without any cost s haring. However, grandfathered health plans must comply with certain other consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act, for example, the elimination of lifetime limits on benefits . Questions regarding which protections apply and which protections do not apply to a grandfathered health plan and what might cause a plan to change from grandfathered health plan status can be direct ed to the plan administrator. Your Rights and Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills When you get emergency care or get treated by an out -of-network provider at an in -network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, you are protected from surprise billing or balance billing. What is \"balance billing\" (sometimes called \"surprise billing\")? When you see a doctor or other heal th care provider, you may owe certain out -of-pocket costs, such as a copayment, coinsurance, and/or a deductible. You may have other costs or have to pay the entire bill if you see a provider or visit a health care facility that isn't in your health plan's network. \"Out -of-network\" describes providers and facilities that haven't signed a contract with your health plan. Out -of-network providers may be permitted to bill you for the difference between what your plan agreed to pay and the full amount charged fo r a service. This is called \"balance billing.\" This amount is likely more than in -network costs for the same service and might not count toward your annual out -of-pocket limit. \"Surprise billing\" is an unexpected balance bill. This can happen when you can' t control who is involved in your care \u2014like when you have an emergency or when you schedule a visit at an in - network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out -of-network provider. You are protected from balance billing for: Emergency services If you have an emergency medical condition and get emergency services from an out -of-network provider or facility, the most the provider or facility may bill you is your plan's in -network cost - sharing amount (such as copayments and coinsurance). You can't be bal ance billed for these emergency services. This includes services you may get after you're in stable condition, unless you give written consent and give up your protections not to be balanced billed for these post - stabilization services. Certain services at an in -network hospital or ambulatory surgical center When you get services from an in -network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, certain providers there may be out -of-network. In these cases, the most those providers may bill you is your plan's in - network cost -sharing amount. This applies to emergency medicine, anesthesia, pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensivist services. These providers can't balance bill you and may not ask you to give up your p rotections not to be balance billed. If you get other services at these in -network facilities, out -of-network providers can't balance bill you, unless you give written consent and give up your protections. You're never required to give up your protections from balance billing. You also aren't required to get care out -of-network. You can choose a provider or facility in your plan's network. When balance billing isn't allowed, you also have the following protections: You are only responsible for paying your s hare of the cost (like the copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles that you would pay if the provider or facility was in -network). Your health plan will pay out -of-network providers and facilities directly. Your health plan generally must: o Cover emergency services without requiring you to get approval for services in advance (prior authorization). o Cover emergency services by out -of-network providers. o Base what you owe the provider or facility (cost -sharing) on what it would pay an in -network provider or fa cility and show that amount in your explanation of benefits. o Count any amount you pay for emergency services or out -of-network services toward your deductible and out -of-pocket limit. If you believe you've been wrongly billed , the following information and resources are available to help you understand your rights: Assistance by telephone - You may contact the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services at (800) 985 -3059 to discuss whether you may have any surprise billing protection rights for your situatio n.
