But progress in the religion and health eld has been inhibited by the relative lack of attention to important conceptual andtheoretical issues. This paper asserts that until we focus as much on the latter as on theformer, this eld will remain marginalized and thus ineffective in contributing to under-standings of the determinants of health and healing. Careful attention to the how and whyof a religion-health connection is imperative for bringing this research into the mainstreamof biomedicine. Keywords Religion /C1Spirituality /C1Biomedicine /C1Holism /C1Health Biomedicine versus Holism With the victory of scientic biomedicine and the biomedical model over the prevailing approaches, which characterized the medical landscape in the late nineteenth Century(Young 1961 ), came an overcondence in the validity and promise of the materialist worldview and its concomitant biological and mechanistic perspectives on disease etiol-ogy, pathophysiology, and healing (see Weil 1988 ). This overcondence, it is often asserted, persists to the present day. According to early proponents of more holistic orintegrative approaches to medicine, this overcondence, moreover, is unwarranted and arrogant (see Ferguson 1980 ). To the defenders of the predominant biomedical model, no such arrogance exists, and an even more strident apologetics is necessary (Angell 1985 )i n light of the seemingly bizarre and unproven alternative and new-age therapies which havecompeted for the patronage of healthcare consumers over the past 25 years (see Levin andCoreil 1986 ; Vanderpool 1984 ). Both of these positions are overstated. J. Levin (&) Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USAe-mail: levin@hughes.net 123J Relig Health DOI 10.1007/s10943-008-9212-zOn one nd stereotypical holists who issue out-of-hand dismissals of allopathy, the name given by nineteenth Century homeopaths for Western biomedicine andmedical practice. In this view, biomedicine is, at best, a misguided and overly rationalsystem mainly good for things like setting broken bones, and, at worst, an evil, patriarchalplot to suppress ancient wisdom and increase suffering all in the name of pharmaceuticalprots. To even the most serious critics of Western medicine, this perspective would seemrather paranoid. It is also an affront to the hundreds of thousands of physicians andhealthcare practitioners who diligently and sincerely use their best judgment to reduce suffering and improve the lives of their patients, and succeed. Caring allopathic medical doctors, both internists and surgeons, alleviate suffering, cure disease, restore function, andextend life on a daily basis, millions of times throughout the world, through pharmaceu-tical, surgical, and other interventions. On the other side, we also still today nd many physicians and biomedical scientists eager to dismiss anything outside of the narrow bounds of mid-twentieth-Century norms ofmedical theory and practice. In this view, even the role of psychosocial factors in mor-bidity, mortality, and the healing process, by now demonstrated in thousands of studies, isdubious. With such a view of mainstream mind-body science, it is no surprise to nd thebeliefs and practices of holistic practitioners (whether labeled alternative, complementary,or integrative) even more anathematized. This perspective is an affront to half-a-century of empirical research on the health effects of social and cultural factors, psychological states and traits, and behavior. Lest this last point itself be thought overstated, let us recall that on the basis of a negative nding from a single, small, nonrandom sample of cancer patients from a singlehospital in Pennsylvania, for example, an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine in 1985 felt compelled to declare that ''belief in disease as a direct reflection of mental stateis largely folklore'' (Angell 1985 , p. 1572). That is not all that long ago, in the timeline of science, and this editorial is still glowingly cited in the present day. It is as if tens ofthousands of published studies, 50 years of empirical research, and the entire elds ofsocial and behavioral epidemiology, psychosomatic medicine, behavioral medicine, healthpsychology, psychoneuroimmunology, psychophysiology, medical sociology, social psy- chiatry, health behavior and health education, and medical anthropology never existed. The take-home point is this: the extreme criticisms of expansive alternatives to the traditional biomedical model by the most vocal defenders of Western biomedicine are justas misplaced as the extreme criticisms of biomedicine by the most strident holists. Suchcriticisms of each opposing ''side'' also seem to rely on mischaracterization. This is ashame, and unnecessary, as valid critiques can be made of each camp, but they require amore measured approach, something that is often lacking in these discussions. A good deal of the holistic critique of the biomedical model, since the 1970s, centers on its foundation in a view of human life as an entirely physical and mechanistic phenomenon.The most serious critics of this perspective are not far-out new-agers or promoters ofalternative medicine, as tacitly presumed, but are principally proponents of the competing biopsychosocial model (Engel 1977 ). These men and women of science are squarely in the camp of empirical scientic research and rarely prone to the extravagant claims tacitlyascribed by biomedical-model defenders to the advocates of holistic approaches to med-icine. Rather than being dismissive of Western biomedicine, advocates of thebiopsychosocial model are largely reformers. They seek to integrate biomedicine's modelof the determinants of health and healing into a more extensive and complete model ofinterpenetrating, interdependent systems (Engel 1980 ). This, they assert, would promise a truly integrative medicine.J Relig Health 123To supporters of a biopsychosocial model, the traditional biomedical model is therefore not believed to be completely wrong or invalid\u2014just a narrow and myopic take on a muchbroader reality. Further, its component biological, biochemical, biophysical, and biobe-havioral tenets are recognized as containing indispensable truths required to explain andelaborate on the interrelations found among psychosocial constructs, human pathophysi-ological processes, and health outcomes. Advances in the eld of psychoneuroimmunologyover the past 25 years, for one, exemplify the earnestness with which this integrativecharge is taken by many high-level biological scientists (e.g., Ader 2007 ; Sternberg 2001 ). There is nothing here of the sort of magical, or wishful, thinking of which critics of the biomedical model are often accused. Few proponents of the biopsychosocial model would assert that attitudes, beliefs, and emotions have causal effects on cells and molecules wholly unmediated by any physio-logical pathway, mechanism, or process: i.e., ''I think (anger, fear, loneliness), therefore Iam (cancerous, diabetic, etc.)''; ''I smile, and my tumor vanishes instantly,'' and no T-cell,hormone, or neuropeptide so much as participates, even for a split second. This sort ofthinking is characteristic of neither biopsychosocial theories nor scholarly holistic writing,which is replete with multifactorial etiologic and therapeutic models grounded in the basicsciences of mind-body interaction (see Green and Shellenberger 1991 ; Rossi 1993 ). Rather, it exists primarily at the margins of metaphysical writing on healing\u2014for example, in channeled works containing afrmations for use to banish specic illnesses from the body (e.g., Hay 1988 ). Curiously, the absolute mental reductionism of some extreme holists is a tting coun- terpart to the absolute biological reductionism which can be observed to characterize somesteadfast allopaths, as Dossey ( 1984 ) insightfully described many years ago in Beyond Illness . As he noted, the emphasis of many holists on things that operate on a ''mental level,'' as opposed to merely a ''physical level,'' signies no less dualistic a view of realitythan that of those allopaths so often derided by holists for their own dualism (see Levin1988 ). Referring to understandings of disease causation, whereas biomedicine seems to reductionistically force the hierarchy of levels to collapse ''downward,'' focusing entirelyon material things, the ''pop holism movement'' , p. 177) ''some sort of therapeutic pan-psychism'' (Dossey 1984 , p. 172). ''Each mistake,'' he as naive as the other'' (Dossey 1984 , p. 172). In other words, the arrogance of allopaths (a physicalistic myopia) and the arrogance of holists (a mentalistic myopia) aremirror images of each other. Resolving the Conflict While it might be hard to tell from the strident writing that continues still today to appear on both sides of this issue, most clinicians, biomedically or holistically oriented, influenced by their daily real-world experiences with patients, probably accept some sort of middle ground implicitly and without controversy. If studies nd that, say, occupational stress,Type A behavior, dysfunctional family circumstances, low self-esteem, or any of a dozenother psychosocial phenomena increase our risk of adverse health outcomes, then it isreasonable to accept that they do so by way of a complex series of biobehavioral andpsychophysiological pathways for which these psychosocial phenomena serve as vital cuesor triggers or effect-modiers. Mind-body medicine is still resisted, in theory, in manyplaces within academic medicine. But in the clinic, the frontlines, so to speak, where therubber hits the road, the observation of psychosocial influences on etiology, risk, naturalJ Relig Health 123history, and recovery is near ubiquitous among healthcare providers, as any informal conversation with physicians, clinical psychologists, nurses, or allied health practitionerswill reveal. Nevertheless, despite the accessibility of this middle ground, the mind-body debate in medicine continues just as heatedly as ever, resembling its cousin, the heredity-environ-ment debate, which itself continues on in psychology, genetics, and other elds. Thisdebate, while intellectually stimulating to a point, is not a particularly useful endeavor inthe long run, as it typically bogs down in efforts to prove or disprove one or another of a set of exaggerated propositions (''mental factors have nothing to do with our health\u2014it's all biology,'' or, ''health is all in our mind'') or to conjure up a singular number or proportionwhich applies universally to all populations and all outcomes (''70 [or 50 or 90] percent ofall disease is psychosomatic''). The tendency to view this issue in black and white has served to isolate physicians, biomedical scientists, and epidemiologists, on the one hand, from social and behavioralscientists and medical humanists, on the other. The latter have decades of experience innegotiating the intersection of the human mind and body, and have developed theories andmodels that accommodate such a connection. Multidisciplinary conversations would go along way toward resolving the still narrowly cast perspectives of Western biomedicineabout a health-impacting role of psychological functions\u2014i.e., thoughts, attitudes, beliefs, emotions, conations, behaviors, and the like. Whether the most extreme holists can simi- larly be reached and led to reconsider their own biases\u2014that is another issue for anotherday. For the record, the present author is dubious. This existing conflict in worldview, however, has had another damaging effect\u2014a collateral casualty, if you will. The never-ending mind-body debate has served to dis-courage consideration of issues of even more ''ultimate concern,'' as Tillich ( 1957 ) would say, than the interplay of mind and body. Foremost is the influence on health and healing ofrealms of human existence and experience subtler even than what is conventionally con-ceived of as ''mind'': the realms of the numinous, the hidden, the esoteric, the mystical, thesuperempirical or supernatural, the transcendent, the superconscious, the spiritual. In otherwords, the domain of the forbidden ''r-word,'' religion, also known as the ''anti-tenure factor,'' two of Larson's tongue-in-cheek descriptors for religion and health research back in the formative years of the eld (Larson et al. 1994 ; Sherrill and Larson 1994 ). This avoidance of things of a spiritual nature is quite understandable, actually, not- withstanding the well-known accumulation of empirical data in support of a ''religion-health connection'' (Ellison and Levin 1998 ). As the present author noted over 20 years ago, ''Western biomedicine ...is still wrestling with a body-mind dualism that dees consensus; thus, for most ...any resolution of a body-mind-spirit pluralism is simply beyond consideration'' (Levin and Vanderpool 1987 , pp. 590-591). Yet while many of today's physicians and biomedical scientists still seem unwilling to broach this issue, manyof the greatest scientic intellects of the past century have wrestled with the relationshipbetween the well-being of spirit and flesh, and their thoughts remain relevant, outlining vital issues amenable to scientic investigation. Among medical pioneers, Billings ( 1891 ), founder of the Index Medicus , published one of the earliest epidemiologic studies of afliation. Later, Osler ( 1910 ), a seminal gure in U.S. medical education and instrumental in the establishment of the medicalschool at Johns Hopkins, reflected on ''the faith that heals.'' Among theologians, Tillich(1946 ), over 60 years ago, described the relationship among religion, faith, health, and healing and, subsequently, identied a spiritual dimension of health status (Tillich 1961 ). Among philosophers, James ( 1917 ), in his classic, The Varieties of Religious Experience ,J Relig Health 123contrasted the religion of sick and healthy minded souls. Russell ( 1970 ), while not a follower of religion, asserted the salience of religion, for good or bad, for the psychologicalstatus of believers. Among psychiatrists, Freud ( 1930 ), likewise antipathetic toward reli- gious beliefs, nonetheless also acknowledged their salience, again for better or worse, forthe psychological well-being of individuals. Other psychiatrists have been more optimistic regarding religion. Jung ( 1934 ) and Fromm ( 1950 ), for example, recognized the potentially salutary role of a religious outlook on life and of humanistic (as opposed to authoritarian) religion, respectively. Frank ( 1975 ), echoing Osler, discussed how ''the faith that heals'' also extends to faith in the physician. Among psychologists, Allport ( 1963 ), in a seminal paper published in this very journal, hypothesized that intrinsic religion serves an integrative function and thus benets mentalhealth. Maslow ( 1964 peaks or pla- teaus of unitive consciousness) are more common in emotionally healthy individuals. Among contemporary epidemiologists, Comstock, longtime editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Epidemiology , published a dozen empirical papers, which included religious measures as independent variables (e.g., Comstock and Partridge 1972 ). Jenkins (1971 ), in a classic review of psychosocial precursors of coronary disease published in the New England Journal of Medicine, included a lengthy listing of studies pointing to a statistically signicant religious factor. Kaplan ( 1976 ), one of the preeminent theorists in the eld of social epidemiology, posed over a dozen thoughtful questions to guide research on patterns and mediators of both the protective and risk-inducing effects of religiouscommitment. Finally, the present author has developed a theoretical model for epidemiology, which outlines hypothetical relationships among features of body, mind, and spirit (Levin 1996b , 2001 ). This model details how characteristics, functions, expressions, and manifestations of religious life serve to protect against subsequent physical and psychological morbidityin populations through a variety of possible salutary mechanisms that bolster the hostresistance of individuals and communities. These include promotion of healthy behaviorsthat lower disease risk, establishment of supportive social relationships that buffer stress,engendering of positive emotions that stimulate benecial psychophysiological and psy- choneuroimmunologic responses, sanctioning of religious beliefs consonant with healthy beliefs and personality styles, and provision of faith and positive expectations that impacthealth through the salutary sequelae of hopeful or optimistic cognitions and attitudes. This model demonstrates that it is possible to posit a coherent multifactorial framework in which spiritual aspects of life impact on physical and psychological health through themediation of cognitions, attitudes, behaviors, affects, and interpersonal relationships\u2014inother words, a model of the interaction of body, mind, and spirit consonant with currentknowledge in psychology, sociology, epidemiology, and medicine. It is an integral piece ofa larger model of what is termed ''the natural history of health'' (Levin 2007 ). This is a salutogenic counterpart to the familiar natural history of disease that efforts, unsuccess-fully, to describe and understand health solely in terms of pathogenesis, or the disease- making process. Of likely interest to readers of the Journal of Religion and Health is the observation that certain salutary religious effects, such as an effect of religious faith on healing, can thus beunderstood in terms of naturalistic phenomena or processes (Levin in press ). Messages promulgated in the sacred writings of respective religions may marshal a faith amongbelievers that can engender psychological responses conducive to healing. Expressions offaith mobilize beliefs and attitudes and thoughts that, along with concomitant affects, mayelicit a cascade of physiological sequelae that impact on immunity and, as a result, onJ Relig Health 123parameters of health and disease (Levin in press ). The recent publication of a conference proceedings detailing psychoneuroimmunologic mediation of a link between religion andhealth is an example of the seriousness with which scientists are beginning to explore thisissue (Koenig and Cohen 2002 ). To be clear, this is not to say that a religion-health connection is fully understandable without reference to God or to other ''divine'' forces that may exist in the universe. Thepresent author, for one, is an unapologetic believer. The how and why of the relationbetween spirit and flesh is a cosmic issue that has challenged the greatest minds for thousands of years. If one is looking to science, and to scientic methodology, to fully adjudicate this matter, then one is probably looking in the wrong place. Not everythingabout an observed religion-health association can be made sense of by reference to theoryand research from contemporary psychology, for example. Other pathways or ''mecha-nisms'' may exist, to use the causal language of science. Some of these mechanisms maybe challenging to those of us who see the world through the lens provided by the main-stream of science and biomedicine. For example, the possibility of ''superempirical'' explanations for religious effects on health has been proposed (Levin and Vanderpool 1989 ). By this is meant that set of concepts related to things like human bioenergies, altered states of consciousness, and thefunctions of what Dossey ( 1989 ) has called ''nonlocal mind.'' This area of science, con- ceptually and theoretically, derives from observations of what Einstein famously termed ''spooky actions at a distance'' (Born 2004 , p. 155), his reference to the phenomenon of quantum entanglement (see Radin 2006 ). Accordingly, the term superempirical implies that, while presently controversial and not accepted by most scientists or physicians, thesephenomena are ultimately naturalistic. That is, they are consistent with natural laws of theuniverse, at least in principle, even if such laws, which are coming to be accepted by somephysical scientists, are considerably stranger than those acknowledged by the mainstreamof biomedical science. So, while distinct from explanations for religion-health associationsbased on psychosocial theories, such superempirical explanations are nonetheless ''sci-entic,'' although not all scientists would accept the validity of the proposed mechanisms.But there is another possibility to consider, farther out even than the superempirical. Currently, a provocative and highly charged theoretical debate persists on which of these perspectives best describes the anomalous results of studies, which seem to dem-onstrate physiological or healing effects due to non-contact forms of spiritual intervention,such as prayer from a distance. This refers to the roughly 200 experimental trials of prayeror directed intention targeting various biological systems and organisms, including thehealth of humans. Positive results, obtained in a majority of these studies, would seem tosuggest that absent prayer can heal, through means about which one is left to wonder. Asmight be expected, this work is controversial, to say the least, perhaps hopelessly so. Bothskeptics and religious professionals have found much to object to in these studies (seeVandeCreek 1998 ). Things are so hot that one of the leading proponents of research on this subject has reluctantly called for a temporary moratorium on further such studies (Dossey in press ). This will no doubt please many people! Yet such scholarly debates over ''how prayer heals'' (Levin 1996a ) are actually a healthy sign. Scientists should always be willing to broach cutting-edge issues and to enterinto dialogue with others with differing views, even if the discussion risks becomingstrident. Envelope-pushing is not always fruitful, of course, but neither is it inherentlymisguided. This is one of the ways through which scientic knowledge in medicine isadvanced (Levin and Steele 2001 ). Rather than something to fear or deride, the existence of this debate is a sign of the maturation and development of discourse in the religion andJ Relig Health 123health eld. It ought to be appreciated and embraced, even if the substance of empirical ndings and the methods that produced them remain contentious. Still, not to lose sight of what really matters here, most research on religious factors in health is not at all controversial in the manner of investigations into superempirical forcesor unusual healing-power-of-prayer studies. For one, there have only been a few dozensuccessful and methodologically vetted trials, mostly in non-human subjects (Benor 2001 ). By contrast, thousands of published studies have explored effects of personal religiouscharacteristics on a host of physical and psychological outcomes, and upwards of three quarters of these studies have obtained positive and statistically signicant results (see Koenig 2008 ). These studies use accepted epidemiologic, social, and behavioral research methods, and their results are consistent with mainstream theory and research on psy-chosocial factors in health and healing. There is thus no longer any need to be reticent about supporting such research, which has by now insinuated itself close to the mainstream of several social science elds,including medical sociology, health psychology, social gerontology, and social epidemi-ology, thanks to the persistent efforts of a cadre of top-notch social scientists (see Schaieet al. 2004 ). It is not surprising that it has been social scientists, for the most part, who have led the way. They may not be as beholden, and thus tied to, orthodoxies of belief abouthealth and religion as are physicians and theologians, respectively. Thus, they seem to have been more comfortable, as a group, in tackling this issue\u2014a putative connection between the spiritual and the physical\u2014without the baggage of likely professional censure. Restoring the Spiritual This essay is entitled, ''Restoring the Spiritual,'' because, this author contends, efforts to incorporate the spiritual into models of the determinants of health and healing representnothing more than a contemporary attempt to make whole what was torn asunder over acentury ago. Those of us laboring in this task do not merit any praise for original thinking. We simply wish to put back on the table those characteristic features of human reality that were swept aside in the enthusiasm over the rationalization of medical education andmedical practice in the early years of the twentieth Century. So what is called for is not necessarily a ''new paradigm,'' or anything that radical. Just a modest effort to take a more expansive view of what makes us ill and what makes uswell, based rmly on accumulated empirical evidence, established theoretical perspectivesconsonant with mainstream scientic thinking, and the clinical experience of thousands ofpractitioners. What is needed is a way to negotiate through the arrogance and myopia ofcombatants who have turned this subject into a polarized battle between extreme andoverstated positions. With these considerations in mind, and after considerable reflection, some guidelines are respectfully offered for redressing this grievous state of affairs which has served only to impair thoughtful engagement of the role of the human spirit in health. The followingconstitutes an agenda for advancing theoretical and empirical work in religion and health.The emphasis is on action\u2014on things that we can do, now, whether theory building,conceptual development, or the conduct of empirical studies. Were this agenda to beimplemented successfully, the religion and health eld could nally hope to move beyondthe contention that characterizes so much of what goes on to a newer era of principled andspirited discourse.J Relig Health 123One note: other agendas for this eld already exist, replete with items calling for more attention to particular research topics or for methodological tweaks (i.e., more longitudinalstudies, more controls for race and sex, more multidimensional measures, more qualitativeanalyses). Many such agendas have been published over the years, and they remain mostlyignored (see Levin and Chatters 2008 ). What follows is quite different; it is not a work plan. Rather, it serves a very specic objective: to facilitate restoring consideration of thehuman spirit to understandings of what matters for health or healing. Each item below, ifimplemented, can help to achieve that end. 1. The religion and health eld would benet most of all from a renaissance of theory. By theory is meant theory-based research\u2014studies and analyses informed by reasonedtheoretical expectations. These may derive from the ndings of past research studies,from clinical observation, from the writings of experts or classical theorists inpertinent elds, or from prior observations by investigators. Theory can be used todevelop testable hypotheses in order to guide analyses and interpret research ndingsfor the purpose of drawing conclusions about, and ultimately making sense of, saidndings. This is how new knowledge is gained. Theory-based research on religion andhealth is thankfully prevalent in certain elds, notably social gerontology (e.g., Krause2006 ) and health psychology (e.g., Smith et al. 2003 ), but is visibly absent in others. This needs remedying. The alternative is to persist in almost random, meaningless number-crunching ventures, with little reference to past work or to how it may be builtupon. Little or nothing is gained, or learned, and what is published serves only as adistraction to newcomers seeking to familiarize themselves with the eld. 2. The religion and health eld would benet from fewer studies of ''health,'' left undened, and more of well-dened biologically or biobehaviorally based endpoints.This is not an argument against the study of global (i.e., whole-person) outcomes suchas general well-being, self-rated health status, and the like. There are numerous helpfuland well-executed studies of such global outcomes, which are easy to use and arethemselves powerful determinants of a host of additional outcomes such as healthcareuse, objective health status, mental health, and even longevity (Idler and Benyamini 1997 ). Rather, this is a call for more studies of whatever outcomes\u2014global, specic, physical, psychological\u2014to emphasize indicators constructed on the basis ofmeaningful clinical or physiological observations. If investigators in this eld, manyof whom are not trained in health-related disciplines, wish to investigate health-relatedoutcomes, then it would benet them to consult with healthcare or medicalprofessionals or with the medical literature in order to identify or construct outcomemeasures that reflect real, observable, underlying health-related states, not simplyidealized constructs developed by social scientists. As with point ''1,'' above, the toptier of researchers in this eld already does an excellent job of this, but not so themajority of the eld. 3. The religion and health eld would benet from a greater willingness among researchers to tap into the domain of subjective religious expression, including the experiential realm. As anyone familiar with this eld will attest, this is a topic leftmostly unexplored by researchers (Levin 2003 ). What is to be gained is insight into how a life of religion, of faith, of spirituality, of piety, is actually lived and felt andexperienced by people of professed faith. Most existing research characterizes a life offaith solely by observation of how that life interfaces with the outside world, in rates ofpublic and private behaviors, for example. This valid and useful approach hascontributed greatly to our understanding of religious expression and its instrumentalityJ Relig Health 123for other domains of life. But it only takes us so far. Until we make the effort to gaze into the human psyche, or to characterize the workings of the spirit, we will not besuccessful in depicting the life of the spirit in its fullness. This will not be easy. Butaccording to a review recently published in this journal, it is feasible, with some effort,and certainly worthwhile (Hall et al. 2008 ). While much less frequently assessed in studies, some guidance does exist for the measurement of things like religiousquesting, religious beliefs and values, stages of religious maturity, personal religioushistory, and religious and mystical experiences (Hall et al. 2008 ). To summarize points ''2'' and ''3,'' reference to the hard-versus-soft dichotomy sometimes used to characterize research might be helpful. Most existing research in the religion andhealth eld utilizes ''hard'' religious measures and ''soft'' health measures. That is, religionis typically assessed through measures of observable behaviors, public or private\u2014numerical counts or population-wide rates of going to worship services, praying, reading the Bible, doing this or that\u2014or, alternatively, measures of specic reported attitudes, scaled and validated appropriately. Health, by contrast, is still typically assessed viasubjective self-reports, whether of global states or of specic symptoms, or via self-reportsof diagnosed conditions, such as chronic diseases. To reiterate, there is nothing wrong withthis approach. It is valid and has been highly productive for this eld. But it strikes thepresent author that this eld would benet, instead, from a move in the opposite direction:toward ''softer'' religious measures and ''harder'' health measures. There are innumerablestudies reporting on the impact of weekly church attendance on self-ratings of well-beingor health. Hundreds by now? By contrast, how many studies have explored the impact ofspiritual rebirth experiences, attainment of unitive states of consciousness, a history ofbaptism by the Holy Spirit, and so forth, on immune system markers, hormone levels, neurological functioning, or psychophysiological indicators? Hardly any, one would guess. It may be a personal preference, but the former seems old hat; the latter seem like a truecutting edge. This may also facilitate communication with medical professionals andbiomedical scientists and thus kindle their interest in this eld. 4. The religion and health eld would benet from a concerted effort to investigate religion's impact throughout the stages and phases of the natural history of disease.The predominant type of research in this eld is population-based, specicallyprevalence studies. Religious and health-related characteristics of well populations areassessed at one point in time and their correlations examined. Where positiveassociations are observed, they are then typically attributed to a salutary and protectiveeffect of religion, which, in point of fact, as any epidemiologist could explain, cannot be validated through such studies. Alternatively, and fewer in number, longitudinal studies in psychiatric epidemiology and gerontology, for example, have enabledidentication of primary-preventive effects of religion on a variety of outcomes,including physical and mental illness, disability, and mortality. For these studies of theeffects of religious indicators on well populations, going forward in time, the operantquestion is this: is religion associated with less subsequent morbidity or disability ormortality? If answered afrmatively, then one can say that religion exhibits aprotective or primary-preventive effect. But none of this tells us anything about ''healing,'' that much overused buzzword especially in the alternative medicine literature on spirituality (see Levin in press ). To identify whether religion indeed is capable of healing effects\u2014that is, a therapeutic and not just a preventive function\u2014requires a different kind of research involvingJ Relig Health 123different kinds of populations. To clarify, we are not speaking here of the controversial randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of prayer-at-a-distance, or RCTs of anything,actually. Rather, the methods used here go by the label of clinical epidemiology ormedical outcomes research. They are population-based and observational, just likemost social and epidemiologic research. For studies of the effects of religiousindicators on clinical (i.e., ill, hospitalized, patient) populations, going forward in time,the operant question is this: is religion associated with parameters of recovery,remission, or cure? If answered afrmatively, then one can say that religion exhibits atherapeutic effect. In the author's opinion, the more of this kind of research the better. 5. The religion and health eld would benet from investigators repeatedly asking themselves this simple question: ''But what does this mean?'' Speculation as to the how or why of a putative religion-health connection is rarely seen, but, to be fair, nor isit a consistent feature of epidemiologic research on any psychosocial construct (Levin2004 ). Still, reflection of this kind is of considerable value. It encourages investigators to focus and refocus on the content and implications of their work in a way that canrepair the damage done by years of conceptual and theoretical neglect andindifference, as outlined above. Reflecting on this question should be done beforedesigning a study, before formulating hypotheses, before conducting an analysis, and,once results are in, before interpreting them and writing them up. This will ensure thatreanalyses and follow-up studies are intelligently crafted and contribute to the ongoingevolvement of knowledge in this eld. The cost of continued neglect will be the continued stagnation of knowledge in this eld. An additional benet of asking, ''What does this mean?'': investigators will reinforce a much needed emphasis on mechanisms of explanation for observed religion-health asso-ciations. This matters. There is a prevailing sentiment among the top tier of researchers inthis eld that, by now, with thousands of published studies containing positive ndingslinking religious indicators and health outcomes, skeptics will nally have to acknowledgea salutary effect of religious participation, faith, or spirituality. Such a view is naive. It isnot how science works, nor should work. The present author, by contrast, has long believedthat there is no number of positive studies that will ever convince those who do notrecognize how or why the spiritual can be productive of salutary or salutogenic effects. Amillion perfectly designed studies will not do the trick. And they should not. On that point,the naysayers are standing on reasonably solid ground. Until and unless investigators beginto do a better job at conveying how and why religion and health are or should be related, then one should not expect people unfamiliar with the scope and depth of research to instantly climb aboard. As a eld, despite several key papers on this topic (e.g., Ellison1994 ; Ellison and Levin, 1998 ; George et al. 2002 ; Idler 1987 ; Levin 1996b ; McIntosh and Spilka 1990 ), as a whole we have done a very poor job at conveying and acting on such information. We thus cannot expect doubters to be persuaded until which time thatmechanisms of explanation are more thoroughly posited, tested, and documented. For thisissue, theory matters as much as data. As the saying goes, I will see it when I believe it\u2014not the other way around. Fortunately, recent efforts have achieved a high level of elucidation of the how and why of a religion-health connection. Several outstanding scholarly books, especially, havesummarized a good deal of associated research and writing related to specic mechanisms or mediating factors. These include comprehensive summary overviews of religious coping (Pargament 1997 ), social relationships (Krause 2008 ), psychoneuroimmunology (Koenig and Cohen 2002 ), and positive-psychological constructs such as forgiveness (McCulloughJ Relig Health 123et al. 2000 ). Other books have made important conceptual and theoretical points regarding the salient influence of race and ethnicity (Taylor et al. 2004 ), aging and life course socialization (Eisenhandler 2003 ), neurophysiology (Newberg et al. 2001 ), and states of consciousness (Murphy 1992 ) on the relationship between religion and health. As Fox Mulder would say, ''The truth is out there.'' But, at the same time, that is not to say thateverybody reading about this eld, or conducting research in this eld, is aware of thiswork. The new book by Krause ( 2008 ) nicely exemplies the promise of a more concerted and systematic effort to explore how and why religion and health are associated. It is no longer enough, as per the norm for this eld, to run a perfunctory analysis and then, after the fact,attribute results to a hypothesized effect of ''social support.'' These two words cover anawful lot of ground, and Krause devotes over 250 pages to a detailed unpacking of theconceptual, theoretical, and methodological specics and nuances and complexities of howcharacteristics of social relationships might account for a religion-health connection andhow we might validate this empirically. His work is a model for all of us on how toproceed. It has now been over 20 years since the present author, in the pages of this journal, posed the question, ''Is there a religious factor in health?'' (Levin and Schiller 1987 ). In that article, the rst comprehensive review of empirical research in this eld, an optimistic tone is apparent. There was much left to do, it was stated, but all of it was do-able. From the present vantage point, it would be foolish, and wrong, to assert that we have not comefar in the past two decades. At the same time, we continue to be neglectful of the samethings that were observed to have been neglected back then. Of the most importantrequirements for this eld to advance, it was concluded that one, above all, ''must head theagenda for empirical inquiry into religion and health'' (Levin and Schiller 1987 , p. 22): This eld calls for the development of a paradigm hypothesizing how and why religion affects health, and guiding research in this area .... Empirical studies informed by such a paradigm should be launched .... Clearly, as readers of the Journal of Religion and Health appreciate, religion is a most complex issue; and if epidemiologists aim to uncover meaningful relationships between religion and health, then they simply must engage these epistemological issues before proceeding (Levin and Schiller 1987 , pp. 22-23). This is much the same issue as is addressed in point ''5,'' above. If researchers indeed seek to restore the spiritual to models of the determinants of health and healing, then theymust give more serious attention to making sense of the empirical ndings that they tacitlypresume to validate this pursuit. By themselves, accumulations of data can do only somuch to engender shifts in perception about a scientic issue. Alongside of well-designedstudies, there must also be well thought out frames or grids of interpretation\u2014lensesthrough which the ndings can be viewed and placed in context. The observationalmethodologies used in nearly all of the studies in this eld, whether epidemiologic, social, behavioral, or clinical, only underscore the importance of attention to theory, to meaning, to how and why questions. This is not an experimental eld. There is no religion-and-health version of physics' Aspect experiment (Aspect et al. 1982 ), for example, which, if successful, will conclusively overturn the existing biomedical paradigm by ''proving,''once and for all, a salutary function of human spirituality. But a strong case can be built ifwe make the effort to transcend the myopia and arrogance of our theoretical presumptionsand labor to truly understand a religion-health connection, not just to document it.J Relig Health 123References Ader, R.
