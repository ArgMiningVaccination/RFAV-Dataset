The committee met, pursuant to call, in room 4230 of the New Senate Office Building, Hon. Pat McNamara (chairman) presiding. Present: Senators McNamara, Williams, Neuberger, Randolph, Carlson, Bennett, and Javits. Committee staff members present: William G. Reidy, Staff Di-rector; Frank C. Frantz, professional staff member; Jack Moskowitz, counsel; John Guy Miller, minority counsel. The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will be in order, please. Ladies and gentlemen, consumer protection has always been a mat- ter of deep concern to many in the Congress, who believe that the Government has a duty to help the people protect themselves fromfraud and deception. The need for such assistance was never greater than it is today. We live in the \"Era of the Hard Sell.\" Television and radio bring the glib, persuasive \"pitchman\" with his often exorbitant, misleading claims into every living room. The reaction to this has been an increasing awareness on the part of many of the need for more consumer protection. President Kennedy has created a Consumer Advisory Council. This is an important first step. My colleague, Senator Hart, of Michigan, has introduced a bill thatwould prevent deceptive labeling of merchandise. I hope the Con- gress will act favorably upon this legislation. Today, the Senate Special Committee on Aging opens a series of hearings on frauds that particularly affect our senior citizens. We hope, in these hearings, to determine the extent of fraud and deception affecting this age group. We seek-first-information, and a number of expert witnesses will provide us with that information. A later step will be to determine whether additional legislation is needed, or whether the necessary consumer protection of our senior citizens can be met in other ways. Some may ask: Why restrict these hearings to the aged? The reasons are several. In the first place, the problems of the aged are the particular concern of this committee. Secondly, the senior citizen is particularly vulnerable to the spiel of the pitchman. When he is ailing and in pain, for example, hewill listen to the glib promoter who has \"the sure cure\" for arthritis. 12 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN Because his income is low, the \"quick money scheme\" has great appeal. In the third place, the results of fraud upon the elderly are par- ticularly tragic. The young have time to recoup from financial folly. But the lifetime savings of the aged-lost to the swindler or the quack-are seldom replaced. It is my hope that the information developed in these hearings- by these experts from many areas-will result in greater protection for the elderly person-from the unscrupulous fast-buck artist. Senator JAVITS. Will the Chair yield for a moment.? The CHAIRMAN. I am happy to yield to my colleague from New York. Senator JAVITS. I want to state I am very pleased to see the Chair call these hearings. I think consumer protection is sadly missing in every element of the Federal Government. For myself I have pro- posed legislation for-and I have long sought-a joint committee on consumers, analogous to the committees on small business, and I think that this also reflects the urgent needifor a Federal program of health care for the aging, and the Chair is doing its best, in view of the wide need in the Federal establishment. I am delighted to see the Chair take this initiative. I would like to acknowledge the presence of Mr. Barnett Levy, assistant attorney general in charge of consumer frauds and protection bureau, and Mr. Milton Myers, assistant to Hon. Louis J. Lefkowitz, attorney general for the State of New York. The CHAIRMAN. The Senator has had a longstanding interest in the problems of the aged and we appreciate his cooperation. Senator CARLSON. Mr. Chairman, may I also express my apprecia- tion for the chairman calling this committee together for this type of a hearing. I think it is essential in view of the problems con- fronting this great group of our citizens, and I sincerely hope that the hearing will develop information that will be helpful in formu- lating legislation. I have an executive session of the Senate Foreign Relations Com- mittee at 10:30 and I would like to be excused at that time. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Carlson, for being here. We understand your responsibilities to the Foreign Relations Committee and we will be happy to have you come back if you can. Senator CARLSON. Thank you. The CHAIRMAN. If there are no further comments, we will proceed with our witnesses. The first one this morning is Mr. Jerry J. Walsh, executive director, Illinois chapter of the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation. Is Mr. Walsh here? Mr. Walsh has two other men with him, I believe, who are from the same organization and we will ask nim to introduce them, when he gets seated, for the record.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 3 STATEMENS OF JERRY J. WALSH, EXECUTrVE DIRECTOR, ILLINOIS CHAPTER; DR. RONALD W. LAMONT-HAVERS, NATIONAL MEDI- CAL DIRECTOR; AND DR. RUSSELL L. CECIL, CONSULTING -MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE ARTHR=ITS AND RFIEUMATISM FOUNDATION Mr. WALSH-. For the record, the two other gentlemen that I have with me are Dr. Ronald W. Lamont-Havers, our national medical director of the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation, and the AMA distinguished award winner of the year and dean of physicians on the problem of arthritis, Dr. Russell L. Cecil. Dr. Cecil is our consulting medical director. The CHAIRMAN. We are very glad to welcome you gentlemen here. I am sure that you have a contribution to make to our hearings. If you will all be seated you can proceed in your own manner, Mr. Walsh. Mr. WALSHI. I bow to the outstanding citizen, Dr. Cecil. Dr. CECIL. Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the com- mittee, my name is Dr. Russell L. Cecil, and I am consulting medical director of the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation. This founda- tion is comparable to the American Heart Society and American Cancer Society in that we are challenging the ills and sufferings caused by one of the most prevalent of all chronic diseases, which goes by the name of arthritis, or chronic arthritis. If we included with this, rheumatism with its various forms of muscular pain and stiffness, you can say that arthritis and rheumatism together constitute almost a universal disease. I want to just say a few words about the problem. I don't want to burden you with a lot of technicalities, but arthritis is any inflammation of joints, the hinges of the body. The term \"rheumatism\" is used for the soft tissue involved. If you have sciatica, or lumbago, or bursitis of the shoulder or of any of the soft tissues of the extremities, it generally goes by the name of muscular rheumatism or bursitis. But arthritis really is the big part of the problem because that makes the cripples. The soft tissue inflammations and rheumatism are generally easily controlled and most of them are curable. There are a great many different kinds of arthritis really, but there are two forms we call the important forms of arthritis. One is known as rheumatoid arthritis, which causes deformities and freezing of the joints. It is supposed to occur in about 2 percent of our adult population, and then there is a second form known as osteoarthritis which is quite different in char- acter and is more a degeneration of joints than an actual inflammation. Osteoarthritis is one of the features of aging, you might say, and we practically all get it, even old animals, and especially the active ones like horses and dogs. Even some of the prehistoric animal skeletons show very clearly that they were subject to osteoarthritis just as man is today, as he matures and gets into the middle and late decades of life.4 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN The other forms that we frequently see in our arthritis clinics are the poker spine, where the back is chiefly affected and becomes frozen into one piece so that you can hardly bend forward, and bursitis of the shoulder and rheumatic fever and gout. Gout is a form that you gentlemen would be interested in because gout, you know, was supposed to be a disease of high living. It got to be a sort of a joke and you were the butt of jokes if you developed gout. But modern studies have shown that the poor man's gout is just about as common as rich man's gout. Though I do not think any of us would advocate a diet or sherry and madeira wine, for a man with gouts at the same time we are not nearly as rigid in our diet restrictions on gout patients as we used to be, because we know that metabolism changes are largely responsible for the disease. Now, what is the relationship of this very common disease-ar- thritis-to aging? There are supposed to be about 12 million arthrit- ics in the United States. About 8 million of these are people who are past the age of 45. Now, does that mean that arthritis is a disease of old people? Not at all. It simply means that arthritis is a chronic disease, and as people who have developed it in the twenties and thirties age, the picture becomes complicated. The symptoms of arthritis merge with the symptoms of aging and, as those of us who have gotten along to the gray beard stage know the symptoms of aging. They really intensify the symptoms of this disease which has already caused plenty of trouble. The treatment of arthritis is readily divided into two kinds, you might say-what we call ethical treatment or the kind of treatment that a well-trained phvsician would give, and the unethical type whichl we are particularly interested in today. This consists of the use of various nostrums and outright quackery, and has become really a scandalous affair. I think that the arthritic and various rheumatic conditions are more subject to quack remedies and more vicious mis- representations than any other diseases. We all know how much you see on television today with regard to the common cold and certain other ailments like constipation, but the one that really rings the bell is arthritis. That is the reason our foundation has become so con- cerned about this problem and has done a great deal to try to check its growth and development. The foundation recently made a. study (the members of our staff did an excellent job) of this problem and this little book is called \"Misrepresentation of Arthritis Drugs and Devices in the United States.\" I think these can both be passed around among the members of the committee. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. We would be interested in making that a Dart of our record for reference, and the recorder will treat it accordingly. Dr. CECIL. The various forms of quackery can be divided into two groups-drugs that advertise, mostly pink or red or blue and other pretty colors, and gadgets. This is a verv interesting examnle of what qoes on in the Slav of quack gadgets for the treatment of arthritis and rheumatism. Here is something that is known as the oxydonor, and I can tell you a very short but interesting story on this contrivance. 'When I was a boy, back about 1894, my mother was suffering from arthritis, and she gotFRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 5 one of these contrivances which is attached to the wrist here while this is put in a basin of water. You are supposed to keep it for half an hour or more and that is supposed to cure the arthritis. It is similar in some ways to the copper bands that you have seen your friends who have arthritis wearing around their wrists. In fact, I saw such a band not so very long ago on a very distinguished doctor and professor in New York City, who was affected by arthritis. I was surprised to see this gentleman, who was a great expert on diseases of the lungs, had resorted in desperation, to this very rudimentary, so- called cure for arthritis. These gadgets are of many kinds, and some are very expensive. There is an apparatus that costs $1,250, and this (the oxydonor) goes for about $35. But it is interesting that this gadget has persisted up until 1958 and was first on the market in 1892. It is remarkable that this simple little piece of quackery should have gone on year after year and been used, something that has nothing in it. I thought there might be a little galvanic battery in it, but there is nothing in it. I think it is amazing that they should have been able to carry that on and advertise it and make money out of it for prac- tically half a century. So come of the quack medicines fall by the wayside very quickly, but there are many of them that go on year after year. The ethical drugs are very different, and the ethical treatment is very different. Our treatment today for arthritis is quite effective. We have no cure for the disease, but we do help a great many. We help them much more than they used to be helped 25 years ago, and we do that because the treatment has gotten away from what I might call pure treatment with drugs, into what is called the physical ap- piroach to the problem. *We put more emphasis on the use of the var- ious physical agents, such as hydrotherapy, physical therapy, occu- pational therapy, climate, massage, and various other means of at- tacking the disease by physical measures. The drugs we use are comparatively few. Aspirin, of course, is the most popular because it is cheap and harmless. Of course, it is also the basis for most of the quack remedies. You will find these beautiful bottles of pink and red medicine containing aspirin solutions with certain other things to make it taste good, that sell for about 10 times the cost of a bottle of aspirin. The other drugs that have stood the test of time are gold salts which are very helpful in rheumatoid arthritis, and the cortisone drugs, which have had a great deal of publicity and have their place in our treatment schedule. Cortisone drugs, and even the gold salts, have certain side effects that the doctor has to be on the lookout for, but these both have an important place in what I call the ethical treatment of arthritis. The thing that we wish to stress today is that arthritis is not only a crippling disease but it is a disease that passes over into old age and becomes a nroblem of the aged along with the usual changes that go on. Thirdly, we want to stress the fact that these people are easy marks, and suckers for the various forms of quackery. They become desperate, and the older they get the more desperate they become. They will spend their last dollar on something that is completely useless and may actually be harmful in their efforts to get well. A survev was made not long ago. out in Colorado, of all of the arthritics in the State, and it was found that 40 percent of them were6 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN getting no medical care whatever. They had just gotten discouraged and were probably sitting around the fire in a rocking chair with some sort of a quack medicine at hand, and they had gotten so desperate they had no medical service whatever. I think I have about used up my time, gentlemen. So I will turn this microphone over to Mr. Walsh. This is a very wonderful and courageous man who has suffered from arthritis for a good many years. I will let Mr. Walsh take the floor. Senator RANDOLPIH. Dr. Cecil, with the permission of the Chair, I would like to ask a question. You have mentioned the treatment for arthritis. I wonder if the climatic conditions of various States whichare now having increased population surges-like Arizona, California,and Nevada-_ wonder whether the older people are going to thoseStates just because they are States that appeal to them from the stand-point of warmth, or whether they are going there because, in manyinstances, they have been told by physicians or those who are familiarwith the cure or partial cure of arthritics that this type of climate would be helpful. Dr. CECIL. I don't think that we have any verv reliable statistics on that. But I will say this: I personally am acquainted with Tucson,Ariz., and I have been there several times, not as a patient, thank God.but as a physician. A great many people have gone there to live because of their arthritis, and the same is true with other towns in Arizona. I don't know about Florida migrations. They had a greatmany older people go there just as they go to Arizona and New Mexico.Some arthritics feel better when they are in a hot, dry climate, andthey discover that, and probably tell their friends. I don't know what the percentage would be, but I am sure a great many old folks go tothose hot, dry climates because of rheumatic forms of pain of some kind. Senator RANDOLPH. I have this final point, Mr. Chairman. Incertain advertisements of housing, mention has been made that theseclimates are helpful to the elderly who are suffering form arthritis. Did you know that there are such advertisements in connection withthe housing? Dr. CECIL. No, I have not seen those particular ones, but, of course, those real estate fellows out there in Arizona are pretty aggressive. I know that. There has been a tremendous growth in population,and I expect that that has happened. Dr. LAMoNT-HAVERS. I think what Dr. Cecil means is that there is no good evidence that going to any climate will affect the naturalhistory of rheumatic disease. Certainly people who go to the South- west may find living easier but frequently it does not affect thenatural history of their arthritic condition. We know of many people who have returned from that area with their arthritis unchanged.Arthritis is affected by many other factors, and climate is usually a very minor one. What we do find is that people who have this mis-taken notion of going to Tucson or Arizona without realizing the economic problems involved, arrive out there and then have no placewhere they can turn for help. They frequently arrive without funds and when they try to seek help the community will not give them help because they must first be residents for a year. This is a great problem.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 7 It is true, as far as advertising of housing schemes is concerned, while the ads frequently do not say that such and such a climate is good for arthritis, they will quote or have a letter from somebody who said that their arthritis was better. This is a testimonial, which is a very bad way of advertising. Dr. CECIL. If I could add a word, one of -the most damaging bits of evidence, of course, against the climate theory is that a good many natives of Arizona develop arthritis right there in their own State. It is not a very good advertisement for the real estate people, naturally. The CHAIRMAN. Senator Bennett, do you have any comment? Senator BENNErr. No, thank you. Senator WILLIAMS. I have just one question, Dr. Cecil. From time to time the question arises around here of whether it should not be required that drugs be described by their generic terms rather than as they are now, by brand names. There are some who have ad- vanced the thought that drugs by this description would then be cheaper. I wonder if you would make a comment on that, and also on another question that arises from your description of the colored aspirin with some other agents in it-would a requirement that makes it necessary to describe generically the contents of these medicines be helpful in eliminating quackery ? Dr. CECIL. If it was on the bottle, you mean? Senator WILLIAMIS. Yes. Dr. CECIL. Well, I think it would. I think that they should be required to put the formula, or the contents on the bottle. There may be some law to that effect. Dr. LAMIONT-HAVERS. Most of these so-called drugs that have an effective ingredient do have on the package what they contain, to comply with the food and drug laws. But, of course, this does not mean very much to the consumer anyway, so that he really does not know what is effective and what is not effective as far as the contents are concerned. I don't think these laws have their intended effect really. For example, alfalfa tea and many similar products have on the bottle all of the things that they contain, so that the person buying it can see what is in there. He can see that it contains salicy- lates, perhaps, but that does not mean aspirin to him. Often he thinks it is some special form of drug. Senator JAvITS. I just wanted to ask one question. First, I would like to express my sympathy with the point Senator Randolph made. We, too, in a State of temperate climate, find that many people have illusions about what mild climates will do for them without realiz- ing, as you say, that people in milder climates have these and perhaps other illnesses. We, too, have the problem of keeping our population in a sense much as we share in the progress of our States. I would like to ask you if it is a fact that in all of these matters, it is really the patient or the person who seeks the cure who is deluding himself. He does not have to buy any of the things that people try to sell to him. Would you, therefore, say that our principal problem is to be sure that intelligent and thoroughgoing, easily assimilable information reaches the potential buyer. That is the real source at which to cut off fraud, because crooks will arise, as we know, about as fast as you cut them down, notwithstanding every effort we make. We should cut them down mercilessly, but still the real point is to reach8 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN those who are the customers for the kind of quackery, is that not so? Dr. CECIL. Well, the old proverb about \"caveat emptor\" does not quite hold true here because these people are so sick and so miserable that they will take anything that is offered to them. I think that they need protection as you say. They need.protection by more avail- able information about the contents of the medicine, just what it can do and what it can't do. Of course, if it has aspirin in it, it is going to make them feel better, but why pay $1 or $2 for a bottle of aspirin. Senator JAVITS. They need alternatives, if the total medical ap-paratus of the country were to give them some relief, then you would find less resort to these quack remedies. Would you say that? Dr. CECIL. Yes, that is the reason for this whole movement of reha- bilitation, of building the rehabilitation centers where people who have any kind of crippling, whether it is arthritis or paralysis or something else, can go and get physical treatment of various kinds. Dr. LAMONT-HAvERs. I think that while it is true that the only way you can combat quackery is to have an informed public, it is also true as far as arthritis is concerned that patients frequently seek greater relief than they can legitimately expect. Yet with most ofthe rheumatic diseases it is the amount of effort which the patient is willing to put into the treatment which gets what he is going to get out of it. All of us being human, we are always seeking some easier way of doing this. Therefore, what we hope to do is to get the patients to ask questions before they get duped, and not afterwards. Then, if knowing the facts they still wish to buy, then it is up to them. They are not doing it out of ignorance. Senator BENNETT. Does your foundation have any program that attempts to reach the individual patient with basic information? The book which you showed us isn't the kind of publication in which you can reach an individual arthritic, or many arthritics, is it? Mr. WALSH. Let me interject that the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation, in its program of fighting fraud with facts, has three goals outlined. One is to educate the general public about the dangersof misrepresented arthritis remedies, two, to direct arthritics to proper medical care, and three, to support all efforts to keep phony arthritis products off the market. This is a program for each one of our 74 chapters in some 46 States, besides the programs of education and rehabilitation, research, and treatment they are carrying on. Of course, our main goal is as we say to provide care today and a cure tomorrow. I am sure with a cure it would not only cure arthritis, but it would cure quacks and the frauds and the charlatans working in the field. Senator BENNErr. Do you have simple brochures which are dis- tributed to individual sufferers? Mr. WALSH. Yes. Our program involves dissemination of this factual information, and also asks the arthritic to call the local officefor information on physicians who are trained in rheumatology, and also for names of clinics when the patient is not able to pay. We have such brochures as this-\"Quackery in Arthritis,\" which is dis- tributed free to the arthritics when they call or write to the office.Others are, \"Arthritis Quackery Today,\" and \"Fight Fraud With Facts.\" The Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation does make litera- ture available to the public.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 9 Senator BENNErr. Do you have any positive information of the type that the two doctors have been giving us, about the basic types of treatment that are useful and available? These two brochures are obviously written to expose quackery, but I would think that the arthritic needs more than that about available information. Mr. WALSH. We have booklets on osteoarthritis, for instance, which afflicts, as Dr. Cecil said, many of the 12 million or more arthritics in the country. We have booklets on home care, gout, and rheumatoid arthritis. These handbooks are available to anyone, though they are not a substitute for the physician. Senator BENNirr. I realize that, but are they broadly disseminated, and are they distributed free upon request? Mr. WALSH. Yes. I can speak for the State of Illinois. Some 34,000 arthritics, registered at our office, receive literature and new information four times a year from us. The doctors receive this Bulletin on Rheumatic Diseases nine times a year. So our program is one of a positive action. It is a program of action because, I, as an arthritic, know the problem in arthritis is one of apathy-apathy on the part of the public, apathy on the part of the physicians, and apathy on the part of the patient himself. I think the only way that you can change this apathy is through education-education starting at medi- cal school and, continuing to the physician, and then on to the patient, and then on to the public, because the public is not aware of this prob- lem. As Dr. Cecil said earlier, in discussing me as a horrible example of what arthritis can do, arthritis is no joke. It is sometimes humor- ous when I am getting in or getting out of a cab, and you can't tell when I go through the motion whether I am getting in or getting out- many people will say, \"My God, Jerry, you mean you have arthritis? You are really in bad shape.\" Well, if they think I am in bad shape they should have seen me back in 1941 or 1942. Arthritis came to me as a Christmas present in 1940. I was 18 years old at the time, and I had participated in sports, and I had been quite an athlete. I get better as the years go on, according to my public rela- tions people; I pitched one no-hit game one time and now it is up to about four or five. I am 40 years old now and I think that is why they brought me in on this aging thing, because arthritis has aged me. In 1940, the dark ages of arthritis, when even diagnostic arthri- tis was a hard job, my case was at first diagnosed as a musclebound condition, then as rheumatic fever, and finally as rheumatoid arthri- tis. The idea was that I was to stay in bed in complete rest, and that I would probably be in bed the rest of my life. I spent about 41/2 years in complete horizontal hibernation and then decided that maybe I could work but of this thing. After many years of physical therapy, and also getting a couple of metal cups put in the hips in 1951, I have been able to work since 1951 for the Arthritis Foundation. But I do want to say to you gentlemen who are taking the time to hear this problem, that with the arthritic this matter of quackery is not a funny thing. It is not a humorous thing. It is not something that you want your picture all over for as a sucker who has been duped. But I can guarantee any of you gentlemen or anyone in this room, including myself, that if you are .in this bed of pain with arthritis, you will try anything to stop the pain, at any cost. You say, \"What have you got to lose?\"10 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN I know that I went from copper bracelets to buckeyes trying to find a cure. I've tried vibrating machines and diets, and had a chiroprac-tor break one of my legs with his special treatment. Yet, continually,I went back, maybe to the tune of $2,000 or $3,000 or more. You don'tkeep track of the dollars, and in fact you like to forget them. You arealways looking for relief. So arthritics, as long as they have the pain and until we find some-thing to relieve this pain, will seek any kind of help, and I do notblame them. With my condition right now, aspirin can do the jobfor me. I went through a period of steroids with various effects andeverything else. If someone would approach me today offering me, with a glibtongue and all, the opportunity of getting better, even better than Iam right now, I am sure that I would think it over maybe for a couple of days. If I could do it in the back room unbeknown to you gentle-men, and I wouldn't have much to lose in time or money-and I don'tknow where I would draw the line on time or money, $200 or $300-Iam sure that I would sneak a treatment. That is because I do want toget better. I don't look forward to aging. I have had this thing22 years. You gentlemen want to stay in your positions year afteryear after year, but I don't want to stay in mine. I have had enoughterms of this. We recently adopted a boy, 2 years old, and I hope and pray that bythe time he is 18 years old, we have found the cause and cure for this,and that you gentlemen have found a cause and cure for quackery andfor the problem of aging, because we all know that people are livinglonger and there will be more arthritis. Those are precious dollars that these people are spending that theycan't afford to spend. But, as long as you have a market out there of 12 million people, and as long as we are a. merchandising world as weare, we are going to prey on these people. We are going to exploitthem. I, for one, speaking only for myself as an arthritic, am sick and tiredof being exploited. I am tired of the apathy, as I said before, on thepart of the public, and on the part of the physicians, and particularly on the part of my fellow arthritics. If we ever get organized, gentle- men, we can put somebody right up in those chairs, because we repre-sent a lot of votes. Right now we have been lulled into saying thatthere is nothing that can be done. There is something that can bedone for arthritis, and if the arthritics get together, we have it withinour power to do it ourselves. It might just come to that.All of the people that you see crippled walking down the street arenot polio victims. These people, young as they may be, have arthritis.So this isn't a problem just of the aging. There will be other Senators,years from now, who will be up there with the problem of arthritisin the aging if we don't have a program of action and education at thistime. I thank you Senators for taking the time to bring the problem ofarthritis to the attention of the public, even though we go in theback door through the older folks. We have always learned fromour parents. Maybe we will learn the answers to this problem ofarthritis through our parents. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 11 I might ask you a couple of short questions because we don't want to detain you any longer. We appreciate your cooperation very much. One of the things that we are concerned with is the question as to whether or not we need additional laws to prevent the sale of such equipment as you have displayed here today. It seems to me that we have sufficient laws on the books now, if they were properly enforced, to prevent the sale of this gadget that you displayed here this morning, Doctor. As you say, it has been on the market for 50 years. That indicates that there has been a great many people victimized by this thing that you say is positively worthless. Now, have you tried, or has your foundation tried, to get to the proper Federal authorities to have this thing banned from sale? Dr. CECIL. Yes, we have. We have made quite a few attempts, and some successful ones, in getting rid of some of the most flagrant quack- eries, but I think Dr. Lamont-Havers can take care of that question better than I can. Dr. LAMONT-HAVERS. I think, as far as the laws are concerned, that there are quite good laws on the books. The Arthritis and Rheuma- tism Foundation has had the opportunity to cooperate and work with the officials of the Food and Drug Administration, Federal Trade Commission, and the Post Office. I think, and quite sincerely, that the people of the United States and their Government should be proud of the dedicated people who work in these agencies trying to protect them. Frequently it is under great handicaps. In many cases, the problems of why something is not stopped arises not because of lack of dedication among the civil servants working in these agencies, but because of the construction of the laws them- selves and the fact that everything must go through the due process of law, and everybody has protection of the law. We are concerned with a large number of areas which I think can be divided into five groups. The first, of course, is with these gadgets, and with those things which are completely worthless, like uranium mines and uranium pads, which are quite popular. For this type of thing, I think that the laws are very effective, and the regulatory agencies do a good job, except where they get caught up in the intricacies of the laws them- selves. The ability of the quack to keep appealing his case, can often enable him to go on year after year. There are products which do have some active ingredients like salicylates. Frequently these have a great deal of money behind them, and can escape the law for a long time. There is this whole area of nutritional supplements, which I am sure others will speak about, and which we are trying to do some- thing about by getting out a diet booklet for arthritis sufferers. There is the publication of widely inaccurate books and magazine articles, which I don't think any law is going to overcome, but which is one of the greatest frauds put upon the American public today. There is the whole area of so-called clinics which operate and ad- vertise widely in this country, to dupe people. Laws to control them are difficult to enforce, because they don't come under the jurisdic- tion of the Federal regulatory agencies. These are problems.12 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN If I may, I would talk briefly about two areas which are really a problem and which point up some of the difficulties which you are having. These problems, I think, are even more difficult because they frequently involve otherwise quite responsible and influential members of the business community. What makes it even worse are the complaints of business regarding governmental regulations, when, unfortunately, too frequently these regulations are required because of the excessive irresponsibilities of this same industry. I think too many people in the advertising world and too many publishers forget that freedom must be accompanied by responsibility. Rather than take your time with many things, I would like to point out some of the problems with regard to the publication of books on arthritis, which has become such a lucrative business at the present time. Some of these books, which are all on quack types of therapy, are by physicians. Now, we believe that everybody has a right to his own conviction, and everybody has a right to have his beliefs published if he wishes to do so, but I think what we object to most is the exploitation of these views by others for their own gain, re- gardless of how this affects the public itself. It would appear that the desire to profit from the gullibility of the arthritic in pain overcomes any feeling of compassion. The worst thing is that some of these books are by well-known publishing houses, and I think this is where it gets very serious. One of them is this one by Dr. Jarvis on \"Arthritis and Folk Medi- cine.\" Dr. Jarvis is quite entitled to his views, but Holt & Rinehart, the publisher, certainly knew that these views had no basis in fact. They were certainly not trying to improve the knowledge of the arthritic public. They were interested primarily in trying to sell this book, which they did, successfully, as you well know. Another one is by Dr. Aschner, also a physician, now dead, from New York, \"Arthritis Can Be Cured.\" The advertising of this book was so bad the Post Office tried to stop it. They won their first case, but they lost on the appeal. They lost the appeal not because the advertising of this book was not false and misleading but because they couldn't prove fraud. Hence, this book, which has now been published for some 5 years, can still be bought on Fifth Avenue, and is still advertised. This is not the fault of the regulatory agencies. It is the fault of the complexity of the law under which they work. This is the latest one. This was in June-\"Bee Venom Therapy.\" This is put out by a well-known publishing house, Putnam & Co. Putnam knew very well that we were concerned about the publishing of this book and the dissemination of this information, and they knew very well that it had no basis in fact. Dr. Broadman was quite en- titled to his views on bee venom therapy, but I think that Putnam showed very bad judgment in trying to promote such a book. They were trying to get in on the fact that the arthritis victim can be duped. This, I think, is a problem. The CHAIRMAN. Then are we to conclude for the record that you and your foundation do not believe that at this point in our history 'we need additional laws? Dr. LAIrONT-HAVERS. The laws, I think, could be reviewed, par- ticularly the laws which govern the Post Office's ability to protectFRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 13 people. The fact that the Department has to prove fraud has more than once prevented something from being stopped. This is a big weakness in the law, plus the fact that they do require so much time. Senator RANDOLPH. May I ask the witness, does the medical pro- fession have any design or any method by which self-discipline could be strengthened within the medical profession? Is that done through any association? Dr. LAM1ONT-HAVERS. This can be done through the county medical societies, but all the same, a physician is still entitled to his views. Anybody is entitled to his own views. What I object to is when these views are deliberately exploited by others for their own gain, and not for his. I think one of the most irresponsible examples of this, and one which has had severe consequences, was an article in Look magazine of May of last year on the so-called new arthritis controversy. This to me is a wonderful example of complete irresponsibility, since the author of that article knew exactly what the consequences would be. He knew that this would result in thousands of people rushing to Canada to get this material, and that this would be a problem. Look said in the article that this was a secret cure, and yet it knew that I knew what was in it, and there wasn't anything secret in this cure. We knew exactly what would happen, and it did happen. This has become even more difficult when you see results like this. Senator WILLIAMS. Did they have the information? Dr. LAMONT-HAvERS. They had available to them all of the in- formation which they needed to show that this particular material in this article would cause serious side effects, and they were warned of this. We worked with them. I found out what was in the mate- rial before the article was published. This little girl took Liefcort that was smuggled into the United States. She went up to Canada to get it, and got some of the material in New Jersey. She is 6 years old, and has rheumatoid arthritis. Now, what happened? She has tremendous breast development, and she gets hair development on her body, and she gets a fungus infection. But worse than this is the fact that, as we predicted, deaths have occurred. I was in Montreal last Thursday and learned that in one hospital there in the last 2 or 3 months there have been two deaths directly attributable to this material. To me this is irresponsible journalism. Look was concerned, pre- sumably, primarily in selling magazines, and not in informing the public themselves. It is all very well to hide behind freedom of the press, but, as I said, freedom demands responsibility. To me this was complete irresponsibility. We have had other examples of this. In 1959 an article was pub- lished in Better Homes and Gardens on immune milk. Again there was not a speck of basis for this material, and yet this was taken up and widely disseminated. It was only because of an action by our- selves in getting the information out that this hasn't become a greater problem to the American public than it is now, because the dairy peo- ple were extremely anxious to put money into the production of thismaterial. So this is an important area-the publication of books, and the wide dissemination of published information. We know from sur- 94703 0-63-pt. 1-214 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN veys that patients with arthritis get most of their information con- cerning the disease not from the physician, not from the nurse, andnot from any agency, but from magazines, television, and radio. This is why this area is so sensitive. When some piece of evidence which has no basis is published, it reaches the public and they believe it. Certainly Look is a well-known magazine. Why shouldn't people believe that this material was something new? Only to be duped. We hope, through such committees as your own, that the responsible publishers-because Look is a responsible magazine, and these pub-lishing houses are responsible people, and I am not saying that theyaren't-these publishers will take into consideration the effect that their actions have on the lives of people. They can't say that this material does no harm. This is not right. The CHAIRMAN. We have Senator Neuberger from Oregon here,and I am sure we are getting into an area in which she has a great in- terest. Senator Neuberger? Senator NEUBERGER. I am fascinated with the testimony, and some-thing that you just said made me wonder if we could carry theanalogy further. You said that naturally the arthritic sufferer thinks of Look as a reputable magazine. Therefore, there must be some credence to it. Now, the arthritic sufferer also knows that the great Government of the United States has a department known as the Food and Drug Ad- ministration, and if the Government of the United States takes noaction against these quacks and frauds, then are we to assume that they might say, \"Well, the Government hasn't forbade the use, so maybe it is all right\"? Dr. LAMONT-HAVERS. The Food and Drug Administration did take rather fast action against Liefcort. The damage was done. These people get this material, or they went across to Canada, and they are still going across to get this material. The Food and Drug Adminis- tration has sent out notices, and prevented or at least tried to stop the importation of this material into the United States. It has done what it can. But, after all, this article comes out in May. It takes time to get processes in order. Two days after Look is out, the whole population knows about Liefcort. They don't pick up the warnings that come out afterward. We sent out a warning because we knew that this was coming out about 2 days before it did. We sent out a warning, but people are not interested in warnings. People are interested in the cure. The Food and Drug Administration acted very fast in this case.Senator NEUBERGER. What do you think that the Government or the Congress could do? Could we do something to strengthen the law? Dr. LAMONT-HAVERS. I think the big thing is to try to get people to think before they act, to become more critical. This is a problem. Senator NEUBERGER. You cannot legislate that.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 15 Dr. LAMONT-HAVERS. No; I know. We are a free country, and you cannot legislate suppression. This problem, to me, is not the law. Coer- tainly the regulatory agencies should be strengthened, both in per- sonnel and in money, to become more effective, but there are certain areas, such as this, which after all reflect upon our ability as a free people. This is where you cannot get into legislation. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. Senator Williams, did you have another comment or question? Senator WILLIAMS. I had a comment. Mr. Walsh seemed to suggestthat there were things that we should be doing, that we can do, that are not being done in Government. I am sure we would, from time to time, like to have your observations on where we can respond properly. Are there any specifics that you have in mind, Mr. Walsh? Mr. W1AALSH. I think the actions of the Food and Drug Administra- tion could be more widely circulated. As Dr. Lamont-Havers has pointed out, when you send out a. warning or when I, as a local execu- tive director, send to our great newspapers a warning this does not seem to get into the paper as much as a new \"cure\" or a new thing on the horizon. Then, too, we must take into consideration arthritis. You know arthritis is a disease that is episodic. You may have a short episode and for a couple of years have an acute stage and then it may be in remission for a while. Whatever you were taking at the time of your remission or when the symptoms were alleviated, you become a disciple for. There is a book over there that was a best seller, \"Arthritis and Com- mon Sense.\" It should be \"Arthritis and Nonsense,\" but our arthritics swear by that book. They have given sworn testimony that this will help. You could get any type of a product and get 20 arthritics who would swear that they were cured by this, because their condition went into remission while they were using it. The crippling of arthritis is just the outward manifestation. It isn't just that you have arthritis here, it is that you have it throughout the body. Arthritis can go into remission all by itself, whether it is alfalfa tea or a disinfectant of World War I that you are taking. That some of the boys in World War I were supposed to have drunk this disinfectant 1 night, and cured their arthritis and ulcers and everything else. So I stupidly drank it. Our former great Mayor Kelly in Chicago took this to the National Democratic Convention and wore this. This is a \"miracle spike\" or vrilium tube that you pay $300 for.16 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN IO'1 Ii \u0001M \"N'ew principle\"-which \"reverses death process into life process\" is claimed for this $30 \"oxydonor.\" The sufferer simply attaches metal disc to ankle, puts the cylinder into a bucket of cold water and his arthritis goes away. The colder the water, the faster the arthritis disappears, according to the accompanying circular. Actually, reports the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation, this gadget is completely useless. The fraudulent device is one of thousands un- covered by a nationwide foundation survey which revealed quack cures and deceitfully advertised products swindle the country's 11 million arthritics of $250 million a year. The foundation has launched a national campaign to ex- pose these frauds and get them off the market.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 17 $300 plus tax !-that's what arthritis sufferers paid for this \"vrilium\" tube which promoters claimed would cure the crippling disease. Actually, reports the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation, the one twvo-thousandth of 1 percent of barium chloride in the brass container has no effect on the disease. The fraud- ulent device is now touring the Nati-n in a foundation exhibit of examples of quack cures and deceitfully advertised products which swindle the country's million arthritics million annually.jW H.-WHO SAYS QUACHERY En IS OLD-FASHIONED? Do you know that arthritis victims today waste more than $250,000,000 a year on worthless or misrepresented remedies?

I just wondered if you could later, for the record, give us anything specific that we could think about in terms of additional Government programs. You don't have to do this now. Mr. WALSH. Enforce what you have and publicize the enforcement. These agencies are understaffed and underfinanced, and it seems as though the charlatans have all of the public relations men working for them. Food and Drug Administration and the FTC and the Post Office do not get the press on these decisions that they really should. This is where I think we have teeth in the law, but the en- forcement has not been given publicity. Senator RANDOLPH. I am sure that the witnesses do not wish to condemn the press per se, because certainly we do know that the news- papers by and large, which years ago printed the advertisements for these fraudulent remedies, have done a notable job of policing. I20 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN think it should be noted for the record that the newspapers of ourcountry, both daily and weekly, have certainly attempted to keep fromtheir advertising columns these remedies which are fraudulent. Isthat not a fact? Dr. LAM3ONT-HAVERS. I am glad you brought this up, because I think it is true, that we owe a great debt to the science writers of this country who, by and large, have really brought to the American public knowl- edge concerning the advances in science and medicine. There is no doubt that the vast majority of magazines and newspa- pers do cooperate very well. We had a wonderful example of this inthe New York Times as far as some of its advertising was concerned. These people are trying to do a good job. However, there are always one or two which therefore make a problem. The CHAIRMIAN. Thank you very much, gentlemen. We are going to take about a 5-minute recess, because the American Medical Asso-ciation wants to set up some sort of a display. Without objection, there will be about a 5-minute recess while the AMA gets their para-phernalia in shape. Thank you again. Your testimony is very helpful.

Illustrated are left to right, inframassage, special diet, the Coleman Chiropractic Clinic, and an ointment called Specifex. The latter on the extreme left from Mr. Duncan Laidlaw, executive director of the Arthritis Foundation's Michigan chapter, to whom all the envelopes were addressed has this to say about these promotion pieces, \"While each one of these represent a different approach in their sales technique, basically they infer the same thing- we do more for your arthritis than your physician. This type of mail seems to be getting heavier.\" These mail-order lists present a serious problem because they are extremely widespread and easily exchanged or bought. Once a person is on such a list, they continue to receive come-ons for one product after another. While a sufferer may resist the temptation to spend several thousand dollars to travel to a clinic for several weeks of treatment, he may not be able to reject the appeal of lower priced items that can be used in the home. In short, eventually he probably spends money on some item, according to his ability to pay.24 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN IMMUNE MILK FOR ( Rheumatoid Arthritis Produced under the guidance of Dr. Wm.

WRITE, SECRETARY, COUNCIL ON FOOD AND NUTRITION; OLIVER FIELD, DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF INVESTIGATION; AND PAUL R. M. DONELAN, LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT, AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION Dr. DORMAN. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am Dr. Gerald D. Dorman of New York City. I appear here today as a member of the board of trustees of the American Medical Association. I am second vice president and medical consultant of the New York Life Insurance Co. I served as a delegate to the American Medical Association, repre- senting the Medical Society of the State of New York, for 6 years, until 1960, and have served, also, on various committees of the Ameri- can Medical Association, including the committee on workmen's compensation, the physicians advisory committee on television and radio, the medical military affairs committee, and the insurance and prepayment plans committee. With me, representing the American Medical Association, are Dr. Robert E. Shank, of Washington University in St. Louis, chairman of the AMA Council on Foods and Nutrition; Dr. Philip L. White, secretary of that council; Mr. Oliver Field, director of the AMA Department of Investigation; and Mr. Paul R. M. Donelan of the Legislative Department of AMA. For your better understanding of the American Medical Associa- tion and its work, we have attached to this statement copies of a book- let entitled \"American Medical Association-Background Informa- tion,\" as our exhibit 1. The CHAIRMAN. We will ask the recorder to see that that procedure is followed, without objection. Dr. DORMAN. The American Medical Association, since its founding in 1846-47, has concerned itself directly with the many problems affecting the general health and welfare of the public, including medi- cal quackery. In adopting a code of medical ethics, the founders ofFRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 27 the association observed: Physicians, as conservators of the public health, are bound to bear emphatictestimony againt quackery in all its forms; whether it appears with its usual effrontery, or masks itself under the garb of philanthropy and sometimes of religion itself. By an anomaly in legislation and penal enactments, the laws so stringent for the repression and punishment of fraud in general, and against attempts to sell poisonous substances for food, are silent and, of course, inoperative in the cases of both fraud and poisoning so extensively carried on by the host of quacks who infest the land. Great strides have been made since this statement was made in the development of scientific medicine. Organized medicine has engaged in a continuing program first, which seeks necessary improvement of medical education to make certain that young persons who graduate from the medical schools are, by training, aptitude, and moral fiber, adequately prepared for their career in the treatment of the sick and the injured, and, second, which continues the education of the physician after his medical school graduation. The association also continues its concern and its educational cam- paign to warn the public against the pretenders to medical skill. In this connection see the 1940 decision of the U.S. court of appeals at New Orleans in the case of Brinkley v. Fishbein (110 F. 2d 62). To educate the public and to keep the medical profession informed about medical quackery, cultism, fadism, and other aspects of pseudo- medicine, the AMA primarily, through its department of investigation, collects and disseminates information on these subjects, not only to the medical profession, but also to the public, to government agencies, writers, publishers, students, and teachers, and any others who have a legitimate reason for inuiiry. It should be noted that the American Medical Association is a private organiaztion and as such does not have the authority or power to put a stop to fraudulent or vicious medical practices. I mention this matter in order to acquaint the committee with some of the activities and function of the American Medical Association. Medical quackery is something that does not limit itself to any given age. We think of arthritis and rheumatism, for instance, as affecting the older members of the community, but the fact is that certain forms of rheumatism attack children; for example, rheumatic fever. The same is true of cancer, which, in the minds of many peo- ple, attacks principally the elderly. But here again, forms of cancer, particularly leukemia, frequently attack the youth of our Nation. Returning to the aging, however, we know that alleged constipa- tion and the remedies therefor are a matter of concern for a great segment of the older population, who are invited, by what actually are false and misleading notions fostered by advertising, to expect dire consequences unless they are \"regular.\" For instance, we recall to your mind the earlier advertising of the product Serutan, which was aimed at all persons over the age 35, inviting them to dose themselves daily with a so-called vegetable laxative, a mixture of psyllium seed and rice polishings. This is our exhibit 2. At one time this Droduct was advertised as a cure for the laxative habit, but in 1944 the Federal Trade Commission ordered the firm to cease that representation and certain other claims which were regarded as false and misleading. A cease-and-desist order was issued in 1944.28 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN Serutan and other laxative products are still offered to people, par- ticularly the elderly, as an answer to their problems. We refer you, however, to two articles in Today's Health, one, published in October 1960, entitled \"Laxatives: A $148 Million Fraud?\" and the other, in the November 1962 issue, entitled \"America's Laxative Addicts.\" Copies of these items are attached, and marked \"Exhibits Nos. 3 and 4.\" The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the record will so mark those exhibits. Dr. DORIAN. Thank you, sir. It is also of interest that when Geritol first came on the market-it was promoted by the same firm-the advertising was beamed at tired and rundown folks over the age of 35. Note the advertisement for this product, containing vitamins and minerals and 12-percent alcohol. This is up on the board here, and is marked \"Exhibit No. 5.\" In December 1962, the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint charging deceptive advertising practices by the current proprietor, which matter is now pending. The current (January 1963) issue of Today's Health commented rather emphatically on the dangers involved in advertised invitations to self-treatment by persons suffering from anemia. Copies of this publication have been submitted to members of the committee who might wish to consider this report entitled \"A Therapy of Chaos,\" written by Mr. Jack Kaplan. (The article referred to follows:) [From Today's Health, January 1963] DOES THE TV OR RADIO ANNOUNCER WORRY ABOUT \"YOUR RUNDOWN FEELING?\" IS HE CONCERNED WITH \"YOUR TIRED BLOOD?\" ONE THING IS SURE: USE Ilis ANTIANEMIC PILL, POWDER, OR POTION-USUALLY LACED WITH ALCOHOL-AND YOu'RE BORROWING A THERAPY OF CHAOS (By Jack Kaplan) Ordinarily enjoying good health, Sue-a 26-year-old secretary-began to ex- perience periodic spells of weakness and fatigue. At the same time, many of her friends remarked: \"You're looking quite pale these days. You're probably anemic.\" It was enough to set Sue thinking about herself. Then she heard a video pitchman huckstering a blood-building tonic-a \"shotgun,\" or multiple, com- pound of vitamins and minerals-as a hocus-pocus cure for \"tired blood\" run- down conditions. The razzle-dazzle suggestiveness of the TV promoter on the effectiveness of the drug as an antianemic preparation proved the clincher for Sue. She convinced herself that she was suffering from iron-deficiency anemia. Fortified by her self-diagnosis, Sue regularly purchased the nonprescription drug-promoted with such hoopla on her TV-over the counter of her neighbor- hood drugstore. How could she go wrong-she asked herself-with a product so widely ballyhooed as a wonder medication for reenergizing the blood? For 8 months she kept up her self-treatment with the tonic. Although she felt pretty good momentarily at times-the considerable alcoholic content (12 percent) of the shotgun mixture accounted for that-she found herself suffering from progressive weakness, loss of weight, and swollen ankles. Finally, alarmed at her condition, she consulted a physician. His findings? After thorough examination and diagnosis, the doctor dis- covered that Sue had been suffering from chronic nephritis, a kidney disease. all along. Sue had not been afflicted with iron-deficiency anemia at all. True. she had an anemic condition, but that anemia was strictly attributable to the inadequate functioning of her diseased kidneys.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 29 In using the tonic, of course, Sue had used a medication which had no therapeutic value for her type of anemia. What was worse, she gambled with her life by delaying much needed medical treatment for her serious illness. As it was, she survived. Others who have deluded themselves in using shotgun iron compounds of the kind she used have not been that lucky. Let's understand, right away, that Sue's is no isolated case-but that hundreds of thousands of naive Sues are being bamboozled today by the heavily promoted antianemic iron preparations. Nor is it difficult to see why. After all, the smooth spiel of the radio or TV announcer seems ever so sensible: If you are fatigued, lack pep, are listless-he says-then you've got tired blood. And-it turns out as you listen-\"tired blood\" is simply a rephrasing of what doctors call \"iron deficiency anemia.\" Doesn't it follow logically, then, that if you take his iron-containing shotgun product, you will-presto-not only correct your iron deficiency, but will give yourself a new lease on health and life by reenergizing your blood? You will, in short, by buying his antianemic remedy find a pepper-upper product roughly tantamount to an elixir from the Ponce De Leon fountain of youth. Clearly, this streamlined performance, promotionwise, has paid off hand- somely for the \"tired blood\" clan-the sales of these shotgun iron mixtures are widespread, numbering in the millions. Turn to the pharmaceutical directories, for example, and you'll find that some 250 of these oral iron compounds-in the form of tonics or pills-are listed as nonprescription, over-the-counter medications supposedly effective for the treatment or cure of all sorts of anemic conditions. Again, a considerable variety of iron mixtures are being hawked through TV, radio, mail order, and-occasionally in the form of food supplements-in door- to-door outlets. Who are these promoters? Well, they range from respectable pharmaceutical houses, mail-order suppliers, retail and department store owners to outright fraudsters. And every month sees more fast-buck boys, rushing in with new shotgun iron compounds, trying to horn in on the gold rush. Certainly, the borderline operators and fringe promoters who market today's antianemic nostrums are really akin to the old-time patent medicine men. Look at the elaborately sponsored radio or TV program of the huckster of shotgun antianemic mixtures today, and you cannot fail to see that it is only a streamlined version of the 19th century medicine show with its flamboyantly presented bunkum about some cure-all tonic. Consider, again, that the patent medicine man of yesteryear promoted a number of popular tonics which had a high percentage of alcohol-a range of from 18 percent to nearly 50 percent being quite common. Sure the tonics contained other ingredients-mixtures of iron, appetite stim- ulants, and useless herbs. But the consumer deluded himself if he believed the blood-building bunkum of the patent medicine hawker-that is, that his tonic vas a wonderful blood restorative. For the consumer's good feeling derived undoubtedly from the same kind of kick he'd get from imb bing several martinis or highballs. No wonder these tonics enjoyed such a wide sale in the dry States in the i)reprohibition days. With his greedy eves focused on the fact that today some 10 million Americans are spending some $400 million a year on vitamins and minerals, the fringe pro- moter of shotgun preparations carries on his practice of putting vitamin-mineral compounds into his alcoholic tonics in deflince of the overwhelming testimony of medical and nutritional experts that it is wasteful, to say the least, and without scientific justification. Moreover. many of these unscrupulous promoters of the antianemic tonics also put out antinnemic compounds in pill form. Of course, these over-the-counter pills have no alcohol. But these multiple vitamin-mineral mixtures more than make up for that omission with a large pill which commonly packs into it all of the vitamins, iron, other minerals, liver fractions, powdered hog stomach, and whatnot. The antianemic com-onnds are offered with such mystical advertising voodoo, with such pseudoscientific explanations-that their use literally may be dubbed a therapy of chaos. A therany of chaos? Dr. William G. Mullin, director of the Caneer. Tropieal Diseases, and He- inatology Clinics of the Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y.. explains: \"The person who turns to shotgun antianemic preparations is very much like the carowner who buys a carburetor and four new tires to repair the engine that is not functioning. He is resorting to a sort of nickel-in-the-slot therapeu- 94703 0-63-pt. 1 330 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN tics-that is, indiscriminate medication for a specific disorder in the human body.\" And then with this springboard statement, Dr. Mullin and another hema- tologist, Dr. Herbert C. Lichtman, associate professor of medicine at the College of Medicine of the State University of New York, spelled out the medicalbunkum of the shotgun antianemic promoters in more detail: The treat-yourself consumer is often so brainwashed by the blood-building quacksters' main pitch (\"Get rid of that rundown feeling\") that he fails to realize that a fellow can be tired from such things, for example, as an argu- ment with his wife, or working too hard-that is, from a multiplicity of causes besides iron deficiency anemia. So he is seduced into buying the shotgunantianemic compound without realizing that he may not have any iron defi- ciency anemia at all. Even if he has anemia, he's wasting his money on these shotgun antianemic preparations. He'll pay 10 to 20 times more for the tonics or pills than he would pay, for example, for the iron salt that a physician would prescribe forhis iron deficiency anemia. Unfortunately for the gullibles like Sue, anemia is a complicated medical problem showing up in a tremendous variety of forms besides iron deficiency anemia. So people like Sue canot conceivably diagnose their type of anemia even by the most careful scrutiny in the mirror. Although the shotgun antianemic mixtures do have two or three ingredients- including iron-which may possibly have some therapeutic value in cases of people with iron deficiency anemia, their promoters most often include too small a dosage of them to make them effective therapeutically. The chief danger of the shotgun compounds is that they pose a threat to the health, if not the very lives, of their users. For one thing, their use may cause people like Sue to delay seeking treatment for their ailment. For another thing, since anemia is not a disease but a symptom of some other disease inthe human body, the use of the shotgun compounds may mask the real disease of the patient. How so? By raising the blood count of the patient so that the doctor canobtain only a confused diagnostic picture. For example, in the case of Sue, the clinical picture was so distorted that it took some time before doctors knew what her real trouble was. In the case of cancer victimis-for whomearly treatment may mean life itself-the use of the shotgun preparation can so confuse the clinical picture that treatment can be delayed until it is too late. Apparently, the shotgun antianemic medication hucksters know what they'redoing by aiming their products mostly at iron deficiency anemia victims. For these anemics are the most prevalent group in the United States. (The same holds true for that matter-as a recent study of the United Nations shows- in India, Africa, and Central and South Americas.) No one knows precisely how many people in this country suffer from iron deficiency. But an American Red Cross study in 1952 stated flatly that be- tween 6 and 10 million American women in the age group 18-59 are so afflicted. Another source estimates that some 15 percent of us Americans have iron defi- ciency. (This contrasts with a proportion of almost 50 percent of the population in some of the countries surveyed by the United Nations.) We have, then, no accurate figures, but it's a safe bet that iron deficiency victims number in the millions here, a fact which makes it a major health problem. Iron deficiency anemia occurs, usually, when the amount of iron in an indi- vidual's diet is inadequate for building a sufficient number of strong red cells. Again, some people become anemic because their bodies cannot absorb or assimi- late the iron they take in. Children, young girls, women, and elderly folk are the groups mostly afflicted with iron deficiency anemia-for different reasons, of course. Teenage girls, for example, go in for food fads that avoid iron-nutrituus foods. So Miss Teenager's iron intake is limited. Again, women-to citeanother example-are particularly prone to iron deficiency because of their special female functions: Not only do their menstrual periods result in the loss of blood cells and iron, but pregnancy causes the most severe iron loss. (No wonder women usually require twice to three times the amount of iron in their daily diet as compared with normally healthy males. The average male, incidentally, hoards his iron so stingily that he rarely develops an iron deficiency anemia due to dietary reasons alone.) In the case of elderly people, the cause of iron deficiency is usually traceable to their lack of appetite.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 31 The therapeutic approach of the physician to iron deficiency anemia? With the use of simple measures, he can diagnose the presence of iron deficiency and either prescribe a suitable diet or administer a simple Iron preparation-usually iron salts such as ferrous sulfate and ferrous gluconate-to achieve a dramatic effect in raising the hemoglobin level back to normal. And he will exercise the utmost scientific care in finding out whether his patient's anemia stems from inadequate dietary intake, a disturbance in gastric secretions, or poor intestinal absorption. And he will, In all instances, administer his iron pills in optimum dosage so as to make sure that his patient will overcome any factor of poor absorption. W\"hat does this signify about shotgun antianemic therapy? With complete the experts-Drs. Mullin it this way: \"The iron in the shotgun preparations is usually of minimal, inadequate dosage-too little to overcome the often-encountered factor of poor absorption of iron-and is therefore of no value, therapeutically, in correcting any iron deficiency. And certainly there is no scientific evidence that the inclusion of the other vitamins and minerals in the shotgun mixtures enhances the absorption of iron. Some experimental studies show that ascorbic acid may enhance the absorption of iron somewhat, but its effect is too slight to justify Its inclusion in iron shotgun mixtures.\" In turning to pernicious anemia, we find that medicine applies the same patient-oriented, individualized therapeutic yardstick to victims of this type of anemia as it does in its treatment of iron deficiency anemics. Usually, pernicious anemia is seen in people of middle age-rarely affecting people under 30. Not only does the condition usually occur in blue-eyed, fair- haired people, but it also runs in families, affecting two or more children and several generations of the same family. Until some 35 years ago, medicine had no cure for pernicious anemia so that, in almost all cases, it resulted in fatal illness no patient surviving longer than 3 years and some 25,000 dying annually from it. Today, of course, pernicious anemia is not as widespread as iron deficiency, but tens of thousands of Americans suffer from it. In pernicious anemia, an inability on the part of the blood-forming organs to manufacture and deliver normal, mature red blood cells to the blood stream occurs. Normally a substance contained In the digestive juice of the stomach and stored in the liver stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red cells whenever they are required. When too little or none of this substance Is present, far too few red cells are produced, so pernicious anemia appears. Put more concretely, pernicious anemia patients have trouble absorbing vita- min B-12 from their food. Evidently, the stomach secretions have some defect. The substance that helps in the absorption of vitamin B-12 is either missing or exists in too small an amount. Without this substance, the important material in the food ingested is not absorbed by the body and is wasted. In addition to the symptoms of all anemic patients, the pernicious anemia victim suffers from problems of the nervous system such as feelings of numbness, prickling, tingling, and a cold sensation because of an inadequate supply of oxygen to the nerve cells. In a small proportion of cases, where treatment is belated or inadequate, a deterioration of the spinal cord can take place. How does the physician treat the pernicious anemia victim? Only by giving him synthethized liver extracts or supplements of vitamin B-12-and no other medications, including the iron, found in the shotgun nostrums. To be sure, this therapy does not \"cure\" pernicious anemia, but the patient will be restored to health-and very much alive-as long as he continues treatment. Of course, his treatment must be for life. Since other diseases (sprue and some serious stomach disorders) have some symptoms similar to pernicious anemia, the patient's taking of a shotgun com- pound can confuse the doctor in achieving a clear clinical picture. Even worse, the folic acid-a vitamin of the B complex family-in the mixture can harm him by masking the disease. How? Well, Dr. Richard C. Vilter of the University of Cincinnati has dem- onstrated conclusively with 36 patients that the folic acid of a shotgun mixture can do a good job of raising the blood count of pernicious anemia victims while permitting the damnie to th- nervous system to hecome progressively worse. That's why the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently adopted the advice of medical experts and put a \"by prescription only\" tag on shotgun mixtures containing folic acid at high levels (more than 0.4 milligram in a daily dose).32 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN Search on and on in other forms of anemia and you'll discover that therapy is just as highly specific and patient-directed as in the case of iron-deficiency and pernicious anemia. For instance, in tvo anemias of intestinal absorption (sprue and idiopathic steatorrhea), folic acid is the main treatment, although it is frowned upon as therapy in pernicious anemia. Or take the sickle-cell or Mediterranean anemias-both of which are heredi- tary-as examples of the blood dissolving (hemolytic) anemias. Sickle-cell anemia affects some 10 percent of the Negro population, just as Mediterranean anemia victimizes Americans of Mediterranean ancestry-Italians, Greeks, Syrians, and Portuguese. In both these familial forms of anemia, the body is congenitally incapable of manufacturing normal red blood cells. What does the doctor do when confronted with these disorders? Use iron or B-12 therapy? No. He knows that their use is futile. So he treats the pa- tient with these anemias by either constant blood transfusiofis or the removal of the spleen. Nowhere else is the harm of shotgun antianemic therapy better demonstrated than in the anemias where primary diseases-infections, kidney disease, hypo- thyroidism, or leukemia or other cancers-are the chief cause. \"Masking,\" Dr. Mullin emphasizes, \"is a relatively common experience in the anemias where primary disease gives rise to poisons which harm the bone marrow. So people like Sue who treat themselves with shotgun preparations never suspect the cause. Unfortunately, it frequently turns out their anemia is a symptom of a malignancy in the body which influenced the fountain of blood adversely.\" One case in point is that of Alice-a 61-year-old housewife who used an iron mixture over several months for self-diagnosed anemia. When she finally got to a doctor, he discovered she had been suffering from hypothyroidism-a con- dition due to a deficiency of thyroid secretion. The shotgun iron mixture Alice used bad effectively masked the ailment. Look next at the example of Harold, a 50-year-old salesman, as an illustration of how masking is particularly harmful in instances where cancer is the pri- mary disease: Harold began to feel somewhat rundown so for 8 months he turned to an anti- anemic shotgun nostrum with the assumption that he had anemia. It had a pleasing effect on him so he felt better at times, but chronic severe pains and an increased feeling of weakness drove him finally to a doctor. After careful examination, the doctor diagnosed his ailment as cancer of a part of the small intestine. An exploratory operation confirmed the diagnosis, but the cancer could not be removed. Had Harold sought treatment 8 months earlier, the chances were good that he could have been operated upon successfully. He died in the hospital. The record shows that there have been many Harolds. Look at the kaleidoscope of the policing of the antianemic nostrums by the two agencies most concerned-the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the FDA. Effective? Only partially. Somehow the tactics of the shotgun crew seem to win over the governmental effort to control them. The FTC has taken action often in the last 20 years or so. Back in 1943, for instance, the agency moved against two shotgun iron compounds, for claim- ing that \"lassitude is due to iron deficiency and that from the presence of this condition the existence of an iron deficiency may be determined by the general public.\" Through the years, it has moved against other iron mixtures. The agency has been on its toes in the past, insisting that many of the iron compound hawkers change their extravagant claims. Typically, it insisted that one advertiser alter his claims that his iron tonic was of value in \"fatigue, run- down condition, lack of energy,\" or a number-of other conditions. Again, in a number of instances, the agency prevailed in forcing a number of iron tonic hawkers to refrain from representing their products as being effective in different forms of anemia, particularly pernicious anemia. And the agency is still on the alert, judging from its recent action against one or the most blatant of the shotgun preparations for its exaggerated claims of pro- viding a sense of well-being overnight. Surely, it would seem that the vigor of the FTC would put a real crimp in the blood-building bunkum act of the shotgun therapy promoters. Not so. The shotgun fraudsters are all too aware that action by the FTC carries no severe penalty. All they have to do is to change the wording of their advertising. And if they come afoul of the FTC again-so what? You just can't get intoFRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 33 much trouble, they figure. So the fringe promoters go on their merry unethical way from one hard-sell pitch to another. If the FTC can, In effect, administer only mild punishment to the shotgun bunch, the FDA can do much more. It can arrange a seizure of a product, requesting a Federal court order to destroy the goods. Besides this penalty, it can even go further and bring criminal charges against medical fraudsters. With respect to shotgun mixture promoters, the FDA has invoked condemna- tion procedure often but criminal charges only infrequently. Whatever the agencies have done against the shotgun iron mixtures up to date has been but a scratch on a pretty healthy giant of medical quackery. So the question remains: What can be done? Well, for one thing, for the past few years, authorities have asked for a transfer of enforcement of the laws governing truth in medical advertising from the FTC to the FDA. That will surely result in more regulation of the bloodbuilding racketeers. For another thing, the FDA can follow up its recent action in restricting high-potency folic acid inclusion in shotgun mixtures with similar action on high potency iron preparations. Wallace F. Janssen, Director of the Division of Public Information of the FDA, has said lately that the agency's Bureau of Medicine is now in the \"process of reevaluating the situation with respect to over-the-counter iron preparations.\" Why? Because laymen like Sue are \"in no position to diagnose the presence of anemia, much less to determine whether it is an iron-deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, or folic acid de- ficiency. All of this suggests that high-potency iron preparations possibly should be available for use only under a doctor's prescription if they are to be effectively used for treating iron-deficiency anemia.\" Apparently, though, it will be some time before the agency can agree on so basic a change of policy. Meanwhile, you and I-the potential victims of the blood pepper-upper charla- tans-must be on our guard against them. Here are some commonsense rules: In general, don't use any treat-yourself shotgun iron compounds. Avoid so-called tonics like the plague, for they can do nothing for you. Learn to recognize the \"tired blood\" pitch in its various guises for just what it is-outright quackery. If you think you have any vitamin or mineral deficiency outside of anemia, see your doctor before you start using any vitamin-mineral shotgun compounds. Don't diagnose yourself as having any form of anemia. To do so is to invite the kind of disaster that Sue, Alice, and Harold met with. See your doctor and see him fast if you think you have the symptoms of anemia. Remember this, finally, about shotgun iron mixtures. It is well known that, back in the past, iron was used for treatment of \"tired blood.\" For example, the ancient Hindu prepared a tonic by roasting sheets of iron, pulverizing them into a powder which he mixed with a number of ingredients like cow's urine, oil, whey, vinegar, and milk. Again, in ancient Greece, the weak and the pale were given drinking water in which old swords had been permitted to rust. Obviously, these treatments were based upon mysticism and superstition. When you resort to the modern iron shotgun concoction with its indiscriminate medication, you're reverting to the same kind of unscientific treatment. Dr. DORMAN. One form of victimization of the aging male popula- tion is the advertising of \"medical services\" to men Oper- or \"Health Insti- tute,\" some firms have advertised cures for prostatic disease, while others advertise positive cures for arthritis and rheumatism. Men who answer the ads for prostate disease receive a series of letters usually ending with \"scare\" literature promising dire results for the individual unless he patronizes the institution. Little of the treatment advertised is of any established merit, yet through the use of the tried and tested techniques of the medicine pitchman, the buyer is parted from his funds. The income of one so-called hospital was stated, in the newspapers reporting the civil trial, to be over $5 million, while advertising expense during the same period was more than $1 million. This so-called hospital, incidentally,34 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN advertised treatment of diabetes among its other claims. The late proprietor, it was revealed in a court-ordered physical examination, was himself a diabetic, but relied not on his advertised cure but on the medical treatment, insulin. Examples of the advertising of \"clinics\" and \"institutes\" are ap- pended as exhibits 6 to 14, and we have exhibits 2 and 3 up here on the posters, showing some of these examples. Another form of medical quackery without scientific or medical basis is the so-called rejuvenation therapy credited to a Swiss physi- cian, Dr. Niehans, and this is up here on the fourth exhibit. Unfortunately, newspapers and periodicals have widely publicized his extravagant claims and many prominent people have consulted him as a result (exhibits 15 and 16). The February 13, 1960, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association carried a critical report of Dr. Niehans' widely touted, but unproven \"cures\" (exhibit Novocain injections; a. weed called Pega Palo (to be immersed in a fifth of rum or other spiritous liquor) ; sea water or sea salt (exhibit 18), and also up here in the fifth panel, are just a few of the wonder drugs which have been touted as rejuvenators, cure-alls, or geriatric panaceas. Government agencies have been successful in keeping these promotions short lived. Another lucrative rejuvenator was Royal Jelly. This product was sold not only in pill form, but also in cosmetics. to enable women to achieve skin having a youthful appearance. Worse, however, were the chemical \"face peels,\" offered by promoters in Connecticut, Flor- ida, Texas, California, and Nevada. State officials in Connecticut and California put a stop to these dangerous activities. Another recent highly publicized but dangerous activity was the clever promotion of an arthritis remedy called Liefcort, from Canada, of which you have already heard. This was the subject of a story in Look magazine for May 22, 1962 (exhibit 19). The doctor in Canada claimed to have a secret remedy, which turned out to be well- known hormonal preparations in a mixture which caused injury and even death. Prompt action by the Food and Drug Administration and the Canadian officials have finally put a stop to the promotion of this product (exhibit 20). Of interest, further, is the fact that the doctor is wanted by U.S. marshals for shipping an alleged baldness cure in interstate commerce. Occasionally, the public is invited to try what is claimed to be very special, powerful treatment at the hands of certain doctors. Demand for such treatment, usually for arthritis and rheumatism, is generated by news releases and certain newspaper columnists' activities, inspired by the seller of the device. Pulsed diathermy is described in sales promotion leaflets as an electrical energy which is turned on and off at an exceedingly high rate of speed, with a resultant loss of the irritating qualities of the heat produced by the energy. While there is no satisfactory medical evidence that such devices, which provide only a small amount of heat at their highest setting, have any advantage whatever over the ordinary and well-known diathermy apparatus, some hopeful people continue to rely on this form of therapy, wasting valuable time and money. They should be protected from exploiters of machines ofFRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 35 this kind which have not been established as worthwhile in the treatment of any human disease, and particularly arthritis. We have not mentioned quackery in the field of cancer, but this, too, is a problem of the aging, and has been a matter of concern to the American Medical Association for a good many years. The association has urged Government agencies to put a stop to the victimizing of cancer patients, their families, and their friends by those who pretend to have adequate treatments for cancer. In this regard, the Food and Drug Administration has been successful, after much effort and a long campaign against the Hoxsey treatment in Texas and Pennsylvania, and the Federal Trade Commission was successful in 1953 in requiring Dr. William F. Koch of Detroit to cease advertising that any of his products were of any value in any disease condition, principally cancer. A cancer product still being promoted at this time is \"Krebiozen,\" a product of extreme dilution, being one part of whatever the active ingredient is supposed to be to 100,000 parts of light mineral oil. This \"cure\" sells for $9.50 for a 1-cc. ampule, which is about one-fifth of a teaspoonful. Competent microchemists have testified to their inability to find anything in an ampule of this product but the mineral oil. In October 1961, to point up the overall problem of medical quack- ery, the Food and Drug Administration and the American Medical Association collaborated to hold a Congress on Medical Quackery in Washington. One of the purposes of the meeting was to bring to the attention of the public the great waste, both in money and, in some instances, in life itself, caused to persons needing prompt and com- petent medical care. Since that meeting, there has been an acceleration of the programs of Government and private agencies. However, one area in which the Federal agencies apparently have not been given jurisdiction is in the interstate distribution of advertisements wherein medical serv- ices alone are offered. This is an area which might be of interest to this committee. The American Medical Association knows the difficulty which is faced when one seeks to put a stop to medical chicanery. No one can legislate requirements that magazines or newspapers or other forms of communications media be obliged to submit their manuscripts or stories for expert appraisal before publishing. All of us would abhor a system of censorship, or the requirement of critical appraisal before publication. This is contrary to our concepts of freedom of speech and of the press. In the circumstances, it is quite obvious that there is no simple solu- tion to the problems of quackery in medicine. There is no way where- by clever supersalesmen, either bearing the designation of doctor of medicine legitimately, or pretending to have the training and the skill ordinarily attributed to the profession, can be prevented from bringing forth some worthless scheme to mulct the hopeful, the anx- ious, and the credulous. This is perhaps the reason why medicine, recognizing the placebo effect, the myriad of modifications in the essential nature of individuals, and man's normal desire for a shortcut back to health, sees no easy remedy in the offing via the channels of legislation. These matters are not problems which can be solved by36 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN legislative fiat, or even by education alone. These are matters whichrequire a combination of both. We pay tribute to the Government agencies which are alert, dedi- cated, competent, and devoted to the duties imposed upon them bytheir legislated responsibility. The Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Post Office Depaitment, and other agencies of the Government whose problems and activities touch upon medicine or persons involved in medicine, have operated in a manner for which the American public can be proud and grateful. Thank you for your attention. I should like, at this time, to introduce my colleague, Dr. Robert E. Shank, chairman of the Council on Foods and Nutrition of the Amer- ican Medical Association, who will discuss, with you, some of the aspects of nutrition quackery. After Dr. Shank's presentation, we will 'be pleased to attempt toanswer any questions which the committee might have. The CHAIIMAN. Thank you very much, Doctor. We will be glad to hear from Dr. Shank at this time. STATEMENT OF DR. ROBERT E. SHANK, CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL ON FOODS AND NUTRITION, AMA Dr. SHANK. Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the commit- tee, I am Dr. Robert E. Shank, chairman of the Council on Foods and Nutrition of the American Medical Association. My medical degree was obtained at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, in 1939. I am professor and head of the Department of Preventive Medicine of the School of Medicine of Washington University. I have been a member of the AMA Council on Foods and Nutrition since 1960. The Council on Foods and Nutrition is a standing committee of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association. The counciloriginated in 1929 as a subcommittee of the then Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry. The subcommittee became the Committee on Foods in 1931, the Council on Foods in 1936, and the Council on Foods andNutrition in 1943. The council was created primarily for the purpose of preventing or discouraging false and misleading advertising claims in the promotion and merchandising of food products. The major objectives of the council programs are: (1) medical education, to inform the medical student and the physician of current concepts and practices in clinical nutrition; and (2) public education, to encourage the practice of good nutrition. Nutrition quackery, fraud, and faddism without question exist inthis country. Americans each year are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on pills, powders, capsules, and compounds in search of a shortcut to health. In many instances the result is only economic waste; in others, it can have serious health consequences. People are urged to eat such combinations as cod liver oil and orange juice to cure arthritis, or safflower oil capsules to treat obesity and cardiovas- cular disease. Belief in such nonsense obviously can delay proper medical attention.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 37 The aged fall prey to the same quackery, frauds, and fads as do the other members of the adult population. Relatively few frauds in foods and nutrition are directed specifically to the geriatric segment of the population; therefore, most of our comments apply to nutrition quackery in general. An understanding of nutrition quackery requires some knowledge of nutrient requirements. The quack and the fraud can sell their wares by convincing their customer that as he grows older, he develops an increased or unusual requirement for some nutrient or food that is not supplied by the ordinary diet. Old age does not necessitate a greater intake of calories, vitamins, minerals, and proteins. Except for total calories, people 60 years of age and over have the same nutrient requirements as people in middle age. Caloric requirements actually decrease with age. The National Research Council's Food and Nutrition Board recommends that calorie allowances be reduced by 3 percent per decade between ages 30 and 50, and by 7.5 percent from age 50 to 70. A further decrement of 10 percent is recommended for the years from 70 to 80. Food habits change with age, but there is little evidence that health is impaired by these changes. The nutrition of older people is in- fluenced by the same agents that act on all age groups. Recent studies have shown that food habits and nutrient intake of old people are influenced by such factors as income, social status, isolation, marital status, presence of disease, earlier training, psychological and physiological condition. Food faddists frequently claim that the physiological change of aging results in serious impairment of the digestive processes, and they Use this cla;m as a basis for promoting encapsulated digestive enzymes and so-called natural foods. Actually, aging has only an insignificant effect on the efficiency of the digestive process. Food is still properly digested and the nutrients utilized even though the absolute amount of digestive enzymes may be reduced. Two other general health areas which invite faddismi are weight reduction and, as Dr. Dorman has indicated, elimination. Adults are frequently taken in by extravagant claims for reducing aids. The public is constantly searching for an easy obesity cure. Perhaps the most lucrative deception is perpetrated by nearly every distributor of vitamins and vitamin-mineral supplements. The im- mediate question is not whether vitamins or vitamin-mineral supple- ments are necessary, but that the vast majority contain elements not needed in human nutrition or not shown to be lacking in conven- tional diets. In 1959, the Council on Foods and Nutrition published in the Jour- na-l of the American Medical Association an article entitled \"Vita- min Preparations as Dietary Supplements and as Therapeutic Agents.\" This has been presented as exhibit 21 in our testimony.38 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN Dr. SHANK. The council stated that the most complex mixture need contain nothing more than vitamins A, B12, C, and D, and the B vitamins, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, folic acid, pyridoxine, as well as the two minerals iron and calcium. The council outlined those dietary situations that would call for supplementation with vitamins and minerals. It is significant that the council recommended that vitamin supplements need to be used only until faulty dietary habits are corrected or until the clinical syndrome requiring special dietary attention is alleviated. The AMA maintains that food is the preferred source of nutrients and that there is no need for the extra dietary supplementation with vitamins, minerals, or proteins in healthy adults. Purveyors of so-called natural vitamins or organic vitamins and minerals perpetrate another fraud. We have placed before you three typical advertisements illustrating this kind of claim. Nearly every health food store and many vitamin distributors promote products as being meritorious because they are derived from living matter and are not synthesized in a laboratory. It can be stated unequivocally that there is no difference, chemically or biologi- cally, between the natural and synthetic vitamins. Yet, because of grossly exaggerated claims, natural vitamins command a higher price. In recent years there have been extravagant claims for vitamin E. A typical false claim is the following quotation: Best known for its direct beneficial effect on the sex organs is vitamin E. Serious lack of this vitamin may cause sterility. All of the body cells need vitamin E for reproduction. Wheat-germ oil is the richest known food source of this so-essential-for-virility vitamin.

Many food supplements have been and occasionally are still pro-moted by claims suggesting that. certain symptoms can be preventedor treated by dietary means. They commonly are tiredness, lassitude, aches, pains, headaches, upset stomach, and the like. In most in-stances the symptom is self-limiting, meaning it comes and goes forno apparent reason. The cause of such subjective symptoms is often difficult to pinpoint, we all have them. Many people purchase food supplements in hope of relief. The food fanatics are wvell organized. Dr. K. L. Milstead, DeputyDirector, Bureau of Enforcemeint, Federal Food and Drug Adminis-tration, has succinctly summarized the current situation, and I quotefrom a speech of his before the 45th annual meeting, AmericanDietetic Association, October 9, 1962, Miami Beach, Fla.: The American Nutrition Society, American Academy of Applied Nutrition,Natural Food Associates, Boston Nutrition Society, and National Health Fed-eration have as their principal objective the promotion of so-called natural orunprocessed foods and carry on a continuous propaganda war against all otherfoods which they refer to as processed or refined. It is their basic tenet thatthe major cause of disease a-ad poor health is \"devitalized\" foods and theyspread the four myths of nutrition: (1) That all diseases are due to faulty diet;(2) That soil depletion causes malnutrition; (3) That commercial food processing destroys the nutritive value of foods;and (4) That most Americans suffer from subelinical deficiencies and thereforeneed to supplement their diets with various concoctions. To this list we might add a fifth false tenet: Nutrient requirementsincrease with age. Again quoting from Dr. Milstead: These are the \"big lies\" that are being spread by these organizations andtheir members. There is no sound basis for any of them, yet they are thefoundation for most, if not all, of the misinformation that is being perpetratedon the American public in the name of \"nutritional science.\" The American Medical Association, the Federal Food and DrugAdministration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Post Office De-partment, and the National Better Business Bureau all cooperate tocombat food and nutrition frauds and faddism. The Food and Drug Administration has been especially active andsuccessful in stamping out, deviations from established food and drugregulations. Between April 15, 1960, and November 1, 1962, it seized 128 food supplement products for violation of Federal regulations. Recent examples of misbranded products promoted to our olderpopulation include: sea salt and sea water, vinegar and honey, (in aproduct called Honegar), and safflower capsules (C. D. C. capsules) promoted as part of the weight reduction program described in earliereditions of the book, which you may all know, \"Calories Don't Count,\" by Herman Teller, M.D. The Food and I)rug Administrationi success-fully prosecuted and stopped these products from continued distribu- tion in interstate commerce. Through various communication media-newspapers, magazines, books, radio, television, mail order, and even through educationalFRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 43 institutions and libraries-the American people are being propagan- dized in a way that tends to undermine their confidence in the purity and nutritional value of our food supply. The public is encouraged to purchase a wide variety of special dietary preparations ranging from seaweed to rose hips which are purported to be miracle health foods or cure-alls for all disease. The food fanatic has many ways of reaching the public. Door-to- door peddlers give advice on health and dietary problems, prescribe their \"miracle\" mixtures for super health and often for the treatment of serious disease. One food supplement chain alone reportedly has had a sales force of over 75,000 people. \"Health food lecturers,\" the modern version of the oldtime patent medicine pitchman, hire halls and offer one or more free lectures as a come-on for the paid series that follow. They usually promote a line of \"natural\" food items and special pots and pans which sell at exorbitant prices. Devitalized foods and poisonous chemicals in our foods are two popular themes of the lecturer's spiel. Lecturers make converts by using scare techniques and distorting scientific informa- tion. Devitalized foods are foods said to be debased by overrefine- ment; modern agricultural practices and food-processing methods are denounced as poisoning the Nation's food supply. Popular books on nutrition and health are another effective way of disseminating misinformation. And on the second panel here are jackets from some of those which you may recognize as having had varying degrees of popularity. Frequently these books contain advice which is medically unsound and could be hlnrmful to individuals following it.- Justine C. Glass, in \"Live To Be 180,\" implies that silica, which is the main ingredient of sand and is used in making glass, is useful in the treatment of cancer and other disease, and I quote from her book: Silica has been used in the treatment of cancer and of sarcoma. Dr. H. H. Patrick, of Glasgow, has reported cases of sarcoma cured by silica. * * * It is by speeding up the antagonistic powers of connective issues (by silica) that the natural cures of malignancy, partial or entire, are largely effected. Malnutrition, epilepsy, rheumatism, obesity, and arteriosclerosis are other complaints in the treatment of which silica has produced good results. J. I. Rodale in his handbook on food and nutrition in the chapter on vitamin B extolls the virtues of brewer's yeast and desiccated liver. Brewer's yeast and desiccated liver, which we recommend as food supplements for everyone, are natural products. * * * These two food supplements have been found, in experiments, to protect laboratory animals from cancer and many other diseases. Liver has been found to be protective against poisons to which we are exposed today, such as DDT. Catharyn Elvood, in \"Feel Like a Million,\" blamed an \"unnatural diet,\" a diet deficient in vitamin E, as the cause of the death of a 38- year-old father. Quoting from her: * * * She (the wife) killed him but she loved him * * * if only I could tell them how vitamin E prevents muscles from becoming riddled with holes and torn with lesions that fill with water. This was the cause of their daddy's enlarged heart. Right here I see the perfect example of that ancient truth, \"Ignorance is the root cause of all sorrow.\" Her ignorance of food, about vitamin E and whole grains, about food and health, is the cause of her sorrow.44 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN t-' WMNPLM BOO OF L I FOOD AND _ '\\ 0 ! \u00b0 KORDEL X 0 Why do people believe the teachings of the food fanatic or faddist?The promoters of health foods and false nutrition information know the reasons and are quick to exploit them. First, the public wants to believe that a pill, a combination of foods,or a special diet will provide super vitality, insure optimum nutrition,prevent illness, and act as miraculous cures for serious illness.Second, food production and processing have become so technically complex that many people can easily be led to believe that moderntechniques adversely affect the quality and purity of food.For the past 4 years, the American Medical Association has carried on an extensive program to combat nutrition misinformation. Aspart of its educational program, a \"Campaign Kit to Combat FoodFaddism and False Claims\" has been prepared. The kit containspamphlets, reprints, reference lists, and information on how to obtain free literature, exhibits, and films from the American Medical Asso-ciation. It was designed to help organizations initiate a campaignagainst nutrition quackery and misinformation. To date, 11,400 kitshave been distributed. Copies of the kit have been delivered to thecommittee for the perusal of its members and staff. A film entitled \"The Medicine Man\" exposes the techniques of thehealth lecturer whose pitch is to sell special food supplements. Since 1958, this film has been shown to the public 12,675 times, including 926 telecasts. The American Medical Association has six copies of an exhibit en-titled \"Nutrition Nonsense.\" This exhibit deals with diet delusionsand food fads. It also shows the value of the various food groups ingood nutrition. The exhibit has a built-in tape recording of house-to-house food supplement salesmen's pitches taken from actual Gov-ernment investigations. This exhibit has been shown 227 times from 1958 to 1962. A photograph of the exhibit is before you on the chartrack.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 45 I thank you on behalf of the American Medical Association for giving us the opportunity to express the views of the physicians of America on medical quackery and fraud. We will now be pleased to attempt to answer any questions that the committee may have. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, gentlemen, all of you. Are there any questions? Senator Williams, do you have a question? Senator WILLIAMS. Well, I know it is late, and I will try to be brief. Dr. Dorman, it has been shocking, really, the testimony we have had today of what is going on in quackery in medicine, and we certainly have been advised by everybody of the difficulty of dealing with this in a legislative way. I wonder if there are not, perhaps, other ways to deal with this problem? I am a lawyer, and in our profession we have a very effective self- policing system of canons of ethics and censure and in some cases disbarment for what would amount to legal quackery. I do not believe the American Medical Association has sponsored self-policing in the same way. I know in my State I have seen ex- amples of gross medical negligence go uncensured, and the victim could not even get an award in court for the damages resulting from negligence, and you know the reason why. Doctors won't come in and testify against doctors. We did not break through this in the State of New Jersey until an enterprising lawyer imported an elderly doctor from Brooklyn, whom I might say was not very active in the practice of medicine any more. It was pretty hard for this lawyer to establish his qualification to testify as an expert, but we got by one judge, and he got to the jury, in one case. Do you see any chance of self-policing the medical profession that will censure doctors who will print books that are filled with medical quackery? Dr. DORMAN. We have taken up this problem. As you say, it is very hard to have one doctor who is practicing in an area with his colleagues get up and say the other fellow is a crook, right out. Senator HILLIAzrs. Not a crook, just guilty of negligence in practice. Dr. DORMAN. Because of this problem, the question of jurisdiction in other than the county or local societies has been considered. The local society is really the court of first appeal. If there is an appeal from their judgment, it is made to the State society, and then to the American Medical Association. The question is whether a court of appeals can take primary jurisdiction in a case. There have been cases where, because the primary court has not acted, there are cases that are going unpublished. The last action of the American Medical Association was a vote by its house of delegates to move toward primary jurisdiction in cases where the local county wvill not act. But it is better if the local county, the confreres, the fellow workers of the physician who is off base, takes the first action in any case of negligence or of wrongdoing. 94703 O-63-pt. 1-446 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN It has not worked out entirely as yet, but 1. would like to have Mr. Donelan comment on your question. Mr. DONELAN. Senator, the American Medical Association and the American Bar Association have been working quite closely for the last 5 years to overcome one of the problems that you mentioned in- your statement; that is, the difficulty in getting physicians to testify against other physicians. One of the reasons that physicians have been found to be hesitant to testify is that some lawyers have been extremely aggressive in their cross-examinations. Nobody likes to be subjected to this type of treatment. Another and probaby more important reason is that they have not the knowledge of the law courts. Now as a result of this program, a new procedure has resulted and more physicians are testifying. This is the impartial medical testi- mony. It has been established in a number of States. I can't give you the States offhand, but I can submit for the record, if you wish it. The CHAIRMAN. We would be glad to have it for the record. Mr. DONELAN. In a number of States there are panels. These panels are made up of the top men in the fields of medicine in the State or county. The court has a right to request them to comment on the medical evidence submitted. These men can be called either by the plaintiff or by the defendant or by the court as amicus curiae. It has been found to be very successful in the areas where it has been in use. Of course, there are members of the bar who feel that this gives one side an unfair advantage. But the point I want to make is that the problem that you mentioned has been recognized, and action has been taken with a good deal of success. Senator WILLIAMS. Well, is there not anyway that you can reach these medical doctors who are writing false cures in books and getting them published? If we, as lawyers, did something analogous, why, our license would be lifted like that. If we advocated shortcuts to legal cures that were clearly illegal, whv, we would be out of business. Dr. DORMAN. We don't get it until after it is published. That is the problem, and the lag is where the damagze is done. Mr. FIELD. Senator Williams, could I offer one thing? The lawyers are licensed through the action of the supreme court of a State, usually. Your name is on the roll of attorneys entitled to practice before the supreme court. The doctors, on the other hand, are licensed by State boards of medical examiners which, of course, are doctors, but it is the function of the State rather than the profession itself, in matters of discipline involving licensure, so there is a difference there. Senator RANDOLPH. Mr. Chairman. The CHAIRMAN. Yes. Senator Randolph. Senator RANDOLPH. Mr. Field, you are director of the Department of Investigation of the American Medical Association, and, in your role, have you any help for the committee as to the most fraudulent practices that you face and the ones that perhaps are most difficult to halt? Mr. FIELD. Well, sir, one of the problems that seems not to be covered by legislation is that mentioned by Dr. Dorman, the persons who advertise medical services in interstate commerce.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 47 Now, I think that particular-or a provision of a bill that was introduced in the Congress in, I think, 1937, had a provision for super- vision over such quack practices but it was never enacted into law. But that is one area that might merit some attention. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you very much. Mr. FIELD. And it affects the aging population more than any one else. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you, sir. The CHAIRMAN. Recently there was a report by the Federal Trade Commission dealing with aspirin and such products. Our committee made a check of Washington-area drugstores and they found the following is true: that ordinary aspirin, just aspirin, when you walk into a drugstore and ask for aspirin, can be purchased from 29 to 39 cents for a hundred tablets; that others, such as Bayer, Anacin, Buf- ferin, Excedrin, Empirin, are priced in some cases 3 or 31/2 times as much as just ordinary aspirin. The report indicated, further, I believe, that all of these products were of about the same benefit in the treatment of the ailments that they were designed for. Do you have any comment on this report? Mr. FIELD. Well, Senator, the Journal of American Medical Asso- ciation carried a report on the relative merits of several of the adver- tised brands of aspirin, but the truth is that aspirin, in order to be labeled as aspirin, must meet the requirements or the standards of the United States Pharmacopoeia; otherwise, the shipper would be sub- ject to the Food and Drug Act for misbranding his product. Now, the truth is if you buy it for 10 cents a hundred, or a dollar a hundred, it is all the same. The CHAIRMAN. In your opinion, then, they are all the same, and the people might just as well buy the cheaper product as to buy these others that advertise so much? Well, even since this report, some of these other companies, the ones with the trade name aspirin, seem to take advantage of that report, and they are plugging theirs by saying that \"Ours is faster\" or some such thing. Ts this utterly ridiculous? Mr. FIELD. We have protested to one of the manufacturers that did seek to take advantage of this advertisement, and we have not given him permission, for instance, to circulate reprints of our report. I think we have a copy here, don't we, of a protest? Dr. DORMIAN. Senator, I have a copy of the letter that we sent him, if you are interested, and also a copy of the press release on this par- ticular matter which the AMA has sent out, and I would be glad to read them now, if you like, or submit them for the record. The CHAIRMAN. We would be very happy to have them made part of the record at this point. Will you do that, sir? Dr. DORMAN. Do you want me to read them, sir? The CHAIRMAN. No; it will not be necessary. Just give them to the recorder, and we will see that they are made part of the record. Dr. DORAIAN. But these have been protested. I was in contact with one of the broadcasting executives yesterday, in fact, in this regard, in New York City.48 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN The CHAIRAIAN. I am glad that you are on to this one, because it does seem that the copy of the Federal Trade Commission's report, plus the publicity that went out from your organization, has served as a springboard for some of these people who are selling a product that obviously is not any better, according to the doctors, and at a much greater price. I want to compliment you on being on top of this thing, and following it up. Dr. DORMAN. Thank you, sir. (The documents referred to follow:) JANUARY 10, 1963. J. MARK HIEBERT, M.D., President and Chairman of the Board, Sterling Drug Co., Inc., ANew York, N.Y. DEAR DR. HIEBERT: It has long been the policy of the American Medical Asso- ciation to refuse permission to have the front cover, or masthead, of JAMIA reproduced in advertising directed to the lay public. I am sure that as a physi- cian you can see the merit of such a policy. During the past few days, a number of persons have called to my attention the fact that a portion of the front cover of JAAMA is currently being reproduced in the advertising of Bayer aspirin to the lay public on television. This hasbeen done without the permission of the American Medical Association and Iask that you issue instructions that the inclusion of this material in Bayer ad-vertising be deleted. Sincerely, ERNEST B. HOWARD, M.D.,Assistant Executive Vice President. CmIoAGo.-The American Medical Association has not endorsed Bayer aspirinover any other pain reliever, Dr. F. J. \". Blasingame, executive vice president, said today. Dr. Blasingame said statements in current newspaper advertising and radio and television commercials have been interpreted as an AMA endorsement ofBayer aspirin. \"The statements are based on a scientific paper published in the Journal ofthe American Medical Association,\" he said. \"This paper reports on a research study which compared the effects of five well-known nonprescription painrelievers. \"The conclusions reached in this study are those of the research team which conducted it. The American Medical Association (lid not participate in thisstudy. Our role was to provide a channel of communication of the findings ofthe research team to the medical profession.\" The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. Are there any other questions ? Senator WILLIAMS. I was rather shaken by the testimony on the lack of efficacy of vitamin pills, to be quite frank. I just stocked up, and I am wondering whether that was a mistake. The CHAIRMAN. Do you have any comment on that, Doctor? Dr. SHANK. Well, we would have to stick by our testimony, and by a position of the Council on Foods and Nutrition of the American Medical Association that for the healthy adult eating a varied, good diet, there is no advantage to be obtained from any of the usual vitamin supplement preparations. The CHAIRMAN. Well, thank you very much, gentlemen. I ap- preciate your cooperation. Did you have something to add, Doctor? Dr. 1DORMAN. I would just like to say for the record, Senator, that I feel that this hearing, in and of itself, which you gentlemen have held here will be extremely beneficial in that the publicity that it willFRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 49 give and the light, that it will cast on the shady business of quackery. I want to thank you very much for the opportunity to be here with you. The CHAIRMAN. 5Well, we want to thank you for making this very fine contribution to our record. At this point we will insert an additional statement from the AMAX and the exhibits referred to previously. (The exhibits follow :) AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. Chicago, Ill., January 2S, 1963. Hon. PAT MCNAMARA, Chairman, Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, Wa8hington, D.C. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: On behalf of the American Medical Association, I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify on medical and nutritional quackery before your Special Committee on Aging on January 15. In the course of the testimony by Dr. Gerald D. Dorman and Dr. Robert E. Shank, who were accompanied by 'Mr. Oliver Field, director. A.MA's Depart- ment of Investigation, and Mr. Paul R. 31. Donelan, AM1A legislative attorney, it was promised that the association would submit a statement to you covering (a) the association's new program of original jurisdiction in medical disciplinary cases and (b) the association's policies and programs urging physicians to aid in the presentation of impartial medical testimony. In addition to presenting information on these two points, I would like to comment on the remarks made by Mr. Field in response to one of your questions. MEDICAL DISCIPLINE Traditionally, the local medical societies have been charged with the responsi- bility of handling disciplinary actions against the membership of organized medicine. Over the years, the American Medical Association has been an ap- pellate body in these actions. At the A'MA's annual meeting in Chicago, June 11-15, 1962, the association was granted original jurisdiction, under certain conditions, in local disciplinary cases. In order to understand medical discipline in organized medicine, it is neces- sary to know the relationship of the A'MA to individual physicians and to State and county medical societies. First, 197,369 of the 269,325 physicians in this country belong to the AMIA. The AMA. has no authority over those physicians who are not members. The constitution of the A'MA defines the association as \"a federacy of its constituent (State) associations.\" The State-associations are separate sovereign associations. County medical societies are chartered by the respective State associations and derive their existence from the State associations. In the past, the State associations have been the authority through which member physicians could be disciplined. Generally, the States have delegated most original disciplinary authority to the county societies. The \"trial\" of a disciplinary case is usually heard by a committee of the county medical society. The \"defendant\" physician had the right to appeal to the State medical society and then to the Judicial Council of the AMA. There are certain members of the AMA who are not necessarily members of State or county medical societies. They are service, affiliate, or honorary mem- bers of the association. The judicial council, for a number of years, has had authority to discipline these members directly. In 1958, the AMA board of trustees established a medical disciplinary com- mittee to assess the status of medical discipline. This committee submitted its report in June 1961. One of its recommendations was that \"the bylaws of the American Medical Association be changed to confer original jurisdiction on the association to suspend or revoke the AMIA membership of a physician guilty of a violation of the principles of medical ethics or the ethical policy of the American Medical Association regardless of whether action has been taken against him at the local level.\" The following year. the house of delegates implemented this recommendation by granting the judicial council original jurisdiction under the following con- ditions: (a) When a State medical association, to which a member b2longs,50 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN requests the AMA to take such action, and (b) when, at the request of the AMA, a State medical association, to which the member belongs, consents to such ac- tion. In these instances, the judicial council has the right to admonish or censure the accused physician or expel him from AMA membership. In November 1962 the judicial council adopted rules of procedure for original jurisdiction cases (attachment 1). Thus, the AMA is now in a position to ex- ercise an effective role in disciplining its members. MEDICAL TESTIMONY Developments in the law have placed increased emphasis on the importance of medical testimony in the administration of justice. Today, about 70 percent of all litigation invokes medical testimony. The American Medical Association has kept pace with this development by carrying out an educational program to encourage physicians to live up to their responsibility by cooperating with at- torneys and with the courts. As early as 1882 the AMA was interested in assuring impartial medical testi- mony. In 1928 the association endorsed the principle that in civic and criminal cases the court should appoint expert medical witnesses. At the AMA's annual meeting in New York, June 25-30, 1961, the association's house of delegates approved supplementary report J of the board of trustees on nonpartisan medical testimony. The report resolved that the house of delegates endorse the principle of nonpartisan medical testimony in the trial of personal injury litigation. It also resolved that the AMA invite the American Bar Association and other national bar and judicial organizations to participate in a joint venture of formulating a model plan for nonpartisan medical testimony. On November 20, 1962, representatives of the American Bar Association, the American Judicature Society, the National Association of Claimants' Counsel. and the International Association of Insurance Counsel participated in a conference on impartial medical testimony at AMA headquarters. Final agreement on a model plan was not reached, but substantial progress was made. For your information, I am enclosing the latest draft of the model plan proposed by the American Medical Association (attachment 2). Thus far, there are nine impartial medical testimony plans in operation. These are in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Cleveland, Utah, Los Angeles, Illinois, and New Jersey. In addition to impartial medical testimony plans, physicians and attorneys at the State and local level have established joint committees to screen cases where physicians have been accused of malpractice. These professional lia- bility screening plans have been established in Idaho; Pima County (Phoenix), Ariz.; California; Scott Pa.; Virginia; Washoe County (Reno), Nev.; and Salt Lake County, Utah. The American Medical Association sponsors biennially a medicolegal sym- posium at which it stresses physician cooperation with the courts and better physician-attorney relations. At the last medicolegal symposium in New York. April 28-29, 1961, David B. Allman, M.D., Atlantic City, N.J., Et past president of the AMA, said in a keynote speech: \"The physician must realize that he has an obligation to himself, to his pro- fession and to the public to cooperate with the legal profession and the judiciary in providing sound, impartial medical testimony under whatever mechanism. exists in his particular geographic area.\" The next meeting of this type will be held by the AMA at Miami Beach on March 8-9, 1963. It is anticipated that over 1,000 physicians and attorneys will attend. MR. OLIVER FIELD'S COMMENTS During your questioning of Mr. Field on the matter of aspirin, he made the following statement: \"* * * Aspirin, in order to be labeled as aspirin, must meet the requirements or the standards of the United States Pharmacopoeia. Other- wise, the shipper would be subject to the Food and Drug Act for misbranding his product. Now, the truth is if you buy it for 10 cents a hundred, or a dollar a hundred, it is all the same.\" This remark prompted the United Press International to report in a January 16 dispatch: \"The American Medical Association confirmed today that aspirin is aspirin, despite the price.\" For the record, I would like to state the association's position on this matter.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 51 It is true that a product, in order to be labeled as aspirin, must meet the re-quirements of the United States Pharmacopoeia. But it is equally true that these are minimum standards and drug products labeled as aspirin are not all the same. There is a mistaken belief that the active ingredient as a chemical product is the sole basis for the effectiveness of a pharmaceutical product. Actually, the physiological response to the administration of a given drug product is fre-quently a function of both the way in which the drug is made and the particulardosage form of the active Ingredient. The medical profession recognizes the varying standards in the manufactur- ing of drug products and is aware of the integrity of brand name products. It knows that the manner and conditions under which a drug product is manu- factured may be as important as the active chemical ingredients. The association's house of delegates, at its annual meeting in New York, June2.-30, 1961, approved resolution No. 82 entitled \"Opposition to Compulsory Use of Generic Names in Prescribing Drugs.\" This resolution stated in part:\"Whereas passage of any legislation requiring pharmaceuticals to be soldunder generic names would place public health in jeopardy; when human life is at stake, the strength, purity, and quality of a drug is of critical importance; and \"Whereas all drugs containing the same active ingredients are not identical; drugs having the same active ingredients and subject to the same standards may vary in more than 24 different respects and still be entitled to share thesame generic name; * * * therefore he it \"Resolv.cd, That the house of delegates of the American Medical Association go on record in opposition to legislative and administrative mandates which would compel physicians to prescribe drugs, or require pharmaceuticals to besold, by generic name only.\" As you can see. there has been some misunderstanding on this matter, and I hope this clears it for the record. In closing, I again want to thank you for allowing the American Medical Asso- ciation to testify before your committee. If we may be of further assistance to you in your current inquiry. please do not hesitate to call on the association. Sincerely yours, F. J. L. BLASINGAME, M.D. ATTACHMENT 1 DiscIPLINARY ACTION BY JUDICIAL COUNcIL \"ORIGINAL JURISDICTIONr\"-RULES OF PROCEDUREPreamble At the annual meeting of the House of Delegates of the American Medical Association, held in June 1962. chapter IV of the AMA bylaws, relating to dis-ciplinary action, was amended. The bylaws now provide that the association may take disciplinary action with respect to a physician's AMA membership (1) when a State medical association, to which a member belongs, requests the AMA to take such action or (2) when, at the request of the American Medical Associa-tion, a State association to which the member belongs consents to such action. Chapter XI, section 10(A) (6) of the bylaws provides that the judicial council may request the president of the association to appoint investigating juries towhich the council may refer complaints or evidences of unethical conduct which, in its judgment, are of greater than local concern. The following rules of procedure, respecting notice of charges and the conduct of hearings before the judicial council, are based upon these sections of thebylaws. Investigating jury At the request of the judicial council the president has appointed an investigat-ing jury. Complaints or evidences of unethical conduct of greater than local concern, will be submitted to this jury by the council. Ino8titustion of proceedings If after investigation a probable cause for action is shown, the investigatingjury shall submit a statement of charges to the president. The president shallsubmit to the judicial council the statement of charges presented to him bythe investigating jury for prosecution in the name and on behalf of the AmericanMedical Association.52 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN Statement of charges The statement of charges shall allege in writing an infraction of the AMA's constitution or bylaws, or a violation of the principles of medical ethics of the AMA. Exhibits may be attached. Notice A copy of the statement of charges shall be sent to the respondent physician by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail. Answer The respondent physician shall have 30 days after personal delivery or mailing of the notice of statement of charges to file a written answer. If the respondent physician fails to file a written answer, the allegations shall be considered to be admitted. Proceedings The chairman of the judicial council shall designate one or more members of the council to conduct a hearing on the statement of charges. This member or these members shall be known as the hearing officer. Hearings shall be held at such reasonable time and place, designated by the hearing officer, as may be consistent with the nature of the proceedings and the convenience of the parties. The parties shall receive not less than 15 days notice of the hearings. The general counsel of the American Medical Association or his designee shall prosecute the charges against the respondent physician. Attendance at hearings may be limited to the members of the judicial council, the staff, witnesses, if any, the parties and counsel who may speak in their behalf. The respondent physician or his counsel may cross-examine witnesses and enter objection to the material offered in evidence. The respondent shall also have the right to call witnesses and enter evidence in his behalf. The hearing officer or its counsel may question the parties and their witnesses. The hearing officer shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence usually employed in legal proceedings but may accept any evidence he deems appro- priate and pertinent. Should any party to the controversy fail to appear at the hearing, the hear- ing officer may, in his discretion, continue, dismiss, or proceed with the hearing. Findings and conclusions At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall render a report in writing containing findings and conclusions and recommendations, if any. This report, together with a transcript of the proceedings, shall be submitted to the judicial council. A copy of the report shall be mailed to all parties of record. Written objections Any party to the proceedings may submit written objections to the report to the judicial council. These objections must be submitted within 21 days after the report has been submitted by the hearing officer to the judicial council. Oral argument In addition to written objections, any party may request an opportunity to present oral arguments on its objections to the report of the hearing officer before the judicial council. This request must be made within 21 days after the report has been submitted to the judicial counciL The granting of oral arguments shall be discretionary with the judicial council. If granted, the parties shall be notified by the judicial council of the place and date for such oral argument; all parties shall be given an opportunity to be heard and the time allotted to argument may be limited by the judicial council with due regard to the magnitude and complexities of the issues involved. If any party fails to appear, the judicial council may continue or proceed with the oral argument. Final decision The judicial council, including the member or members who serve as the hearing officer, shall render a final decision. A copy of that decision shall be mailed or otherwise served upon all parties.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 53 Disciplinary action The judicial council shall have the authority to acquit, admonish, or censure the accused physician or suspend or expel him from AMA membership as the factsmay justify. This action shall be in accordance with the authority vested in the council by chapter IV, section (1) (B) and chapter XI, section (10) (A) (6) of the bylaws. Transcript A written transcript shall be made of the proceedings and of the oral argument before the judicial council. If any party to the controversy requests a copy of the transcript, it shall be made available to him at his expense. Filing of copies Three copies of all pleadings and exhibits shall be submitted to AMA head-quarters to the chairman of the judicial council. One copy of each document shall be submitted at the same time to each of the other parties to the controversy. ATTACHMENT 2 RULES OF THE - COURT RULE NO.-. INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXPERTS (a) In any personal injury case, if it appears to the court that an independent medical examination will materially aid in the just determination of the case. the court, on its own motion or on motion of any party, may order a physical or mental examination of the party whose physical or mental condition is in issue in the case, by one independent medical expert chosen from each of one or more panels of independent medical experts in the principal fields of medi- cine, such as: (1) general surgery, (2) plastic surgery, (3) ophthalmology, (4) cardiovascular diseases, (5) dermatology, (6) tuberculosis, (7) internal medicine,- (8) neurosurgery, (9) neurology, (10) psychiatry, (11) neuropsychiatry, (12) roentgenology, (13) orthopedics, (14) otolaryngology, (15) obstetrics and gyne- cology, (16) genitourinary diseases, (17) malignancy and trauma, (18) en- docrinology, (19) anesthesiology, (20) pediatrics, and (21) pathology. Mem- bers of the several panels shall be selected by the ---------- Medical Society on the basis of their special qualifications and their lack of bias or partisanship. When requested by the court, the -______ Medical Society shall designate one independent medical expert from the panel in each of the one or more principal fields of medicine specified by the court. Such designation shall be made on a rotating basis, in such a manner that neither the court nor any party shall know in advance which member of the panel will be designated. (b) The court or any party may move for such an order requesting the des- ignation of one independent medical expert from any of one or more of the fields of medicine in which it is established to the satisfaction of the court that there is a substantial question of expert medical opinion at issue in the case. If any party shall allege in opposition to such motion that there is a division of reputable medical opinion on a medical question at issue in the case, as framed by the allegations of the complaint, in the particular field of medicine of any independent medical expert who would be designated pursuant to thecourt's order if it were granted, the court shall refer such medical question to the panel of independent medical experts of which such independent medical expert is a member, solely for the purpose of a determination by the panel, sitting en bane, as to whether there is a division of reputable medical opinion with respect to that particular medical question. The determination of such panel shall not be disclosed to the jury in that case in any manner, either directly or indirectly. If any member of a panel to which such question is referred shall determine that there is a division of reputable medical opinion with respect to such particular medical question, the court shall deny the order insofar as it applies to that particular medical question, and no independent medical expert who may be designated pursuant to an order of the court in that case shall in anyway express his medical opinion in connection with that case on such particular medical question, and neither the court nor any party shall question any independent medical expert in relation to that case concerning54 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN such medical opinion, but the court shall not be barred from issuing an order requesting the designation of an intlependent medical expert in relation to any other medical question in issue in the case. In the event that no member of a panel to which such question is referred shall determine that there is a division of reputable medical opinion on such particular medical question, or in the event that no party shall allege that there is such division of reputable medical opinion with respect to any one or more medical questions at issue in the case, the court may, in its discretion, grant the order. (c) Where an examination of a party by one or more independent medical experts has been ordered in accordance with this rule, each party shall furnish to each of such independent medical experts a copy of all hospital records, X-rays, laboratory reports, and other medical data which are relevant to or may be offered in evidence in the case. The independent medical expert shall per- sonally examine the party whose mental or physical condition is in issue, and shall have such special tests or examinations made as he deems necessary for a proper evaluation of the party's physical or mental condition. On the basis of his examination and all other relevant medical data available to him, the independent medical expert shall, within a reasonable time, make a written re- port as to the results of his examination together with his conclusions and prog- nosis. One copy of this report shall be furnished promptly to each of the parties and to the court. (d) If the case goes to trial, any one or more of the designated independent medical experts who has made a report in the case under this rule may be called as an expert medical witness by the court on its own motion or shall be called by the court at the request of any party. Such independent medical expert when called by the court as an expert medical witness shall be identified as a medical expert in his particular field of medicine who is independent of any of the parties and who is called by the court as a medical expert witness, but the jury shall be instructed that the testimony of such independent expert witness is to be given no greater weight, because of the fact that he is called as a wit- ness by the court rather than by one of the parties, than the testimony of any other qualified expert witness appearing in the case. Any independent medical expert called by the court as an expert medical witness shall be subject to full cross-examination by any party and by the court. (e) (The method of compensation of the independent medical expert for his services is left open. He may be paid out of general court funds. without ex- pense to any party. He may be paid by the party who moves for the court order. The expense may be apportioned among the parties. This part of the rule may be determined locally.) (f) Any independent medical expert, while serving as a member of any panel under the provisions of this rule, shall not accept employment as an expert medi- cal consultant or an expert medical witness in any personal injury case, except by order of the court under this rule. (g) This rule shall be administered by the ---------- officer of the court. ExHIBIT 1 BAsIc FACTS ABOUT THE AmERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION Its beginning.-AMA was founded May 5, 1847, in Philadelphia, Pa., by 250 physicians representing more than 40 medical societies and 28 colleges, em- bracing medical institutions in 22 States. These doctors were concerned about the poor quality of medical education in the United States. about the brisk traffic in patent medicines and secret remedies, and about the lack of a recognized code of ethics. They felt that a national association of physicians was needed to lead the crusade for better medical care. The association's founder was 30-year-old Dr. Nathan Smith Davis, of Newv York. First president was D)r. Nathaniel Chapman of Pennsylvania. Its purpose.-Article II of the constitution of the AMA reads: \"[The objectives of the association are] to promote the science and art of medicine and the better- ment of public health.\" AMA's primary goals are better health for all people, and service to the professional needs of the membership. Membersihip.-AMA membership includes some 186,000 physicians, approxi- mately 71 percent of the Nation's 261,000 licensed physicians. Any physician who Is a member in good standing of his ,State medical society may become a member of the American Medical Association.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 55 Organization.-The AMA Is a federation of .54 State and territorial medicalassociations. These in turn are composed of almost 2,000 county or districtmedical societies. The representative government principle applies throughout.with authority moving up from the county society through the State associationto the national body, through the process of elected delegates.House of delegatCs.-The house of delegates is the national policymaking bodyof the medical profession. It is composed of 218 members, most of whom areelected from each State association, on the basis of 1 delegate for each 1.000 activemembers of AMA or a portion thereof in each State. The house also includes1 representative from each of the 20 sections of AMA's scientific assembly. Thisassures representation from every branch of medicine, since one section isdevoted to general practice and the rest to the various specialties. The houseincludes, in addition, a delegate from each of the Government services-Army.Navy, Air Force, Veterans' Administration, and Public Health Service-and twononvoting delegates from the student AMIA. Past presidents and certain otherofficials are also nonvoting delegates. The house meets twice annually (in Juneand December) to establish policies and programs.Oflicers.-The president, president-elect, vice president, speaker of the houseof delegates, and vice speaker are elected each year by the house of delegates.Board of trusteCs.-Between meetings of the house of delegates, the AMA isgoverned by the board of trustees. It is composed of the president, president-elect. and nine trustees. who are elected by the house from different geographicalregions of the country. Each trustee is named for a 5-year term and may succeedhimself only once. Officers and trustees serve without pay.Headquartcrs staff.-The staff to carry out the programs inaugurated by thehouse of delegates is headquartered at 5.35 North Dearborn Street, Chicago 10.Ill. It is under the direction of the executive vice president, a full-time, salariedphysician-administrator. There are about 700 persons on the headquarters staff,13 of whom are in Washington. D.C.ANA biedget.-AMA's budget is approximately $16 million annually. In 1960.50.1 percent of the income came from advertising in AIMA publications. 22.8percent from membership dues, 14.4 percent from outside subscriptions, 6.7percent from miscellaneous sources, 3 percent from investments, and 3 percentfrom the sale of exhibit space at meetings. In 1960, expenditures were:Paper, printing, and mailing costs, 41.7 percent; business division (includesdepartments of accounting, advertising, building services, circulation and records.contract printing, convention services, operating services, and personnel), 16.7percent; conmmunications division (includes editorial preparation of the AIMANews and Today's Health and departments of news, scientific news, magazinerelations, radio, TV and motion pictures, exhibits, medical motion picturesand television, program development, services to officers, and special services).8.5 percent; scientific activities division (includes work of departments ofadvertising evaluation, drugs, foods and nutrition, medical education and hos-pitals, medical physics and rehabilitation, mental health, nursing, and scientificassembly), 6.8 percent; executive vice president's office (includes such \"em-ployer\" expenses as real estate taxes and social security taxes), 8.3 percent:environmental medicine division (includes departments of health education.international health, national security, occupational health, rural health, andWashington medical liaison representatives), 2.7 percent; legal and socio-economic division (includes departments of economic research, investigation.medical service, law, legislative, medical ethics, legal medicine, and a Wash-ington representative), 4.6 percent: scientific publications division (includespreparation of editorial content of the Journal of AM1A and 10 specialty journalsand departments of archives-library, research and documentation in medicaljournalism, and standard nomenclature). 4 percent; field service division (in-cludes the field representatives and 3 legislative representatives in Washington).1.5 percent: board of trustees (finances meetings of various AMA councils andconunittees which are advisory to the board and to the house of delegates).4.5 percent; Washington division (includes work of the office and its staff exceptthqse members attached to other divisions), 0.7 percent.Publications.-Publications are a highly important facet of AMA's program.Since 188.3 the Journal of the American Medical Association has been the mostwidely circulated medical journal in the world.To meet the needs of the medical specialties, AMA publishes 10 monthly spe-cialty journals:Archives of General Psychiatry, Archives of Dermatology, Archives of Oto-laryngology, Archives of Environmental Health, Archives of Pathology, Archives56 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN of Ophthalmology, Archives of Internal Medicine, Archives of Surgery, Archives of Neurology, and American Journal of Diseases of Children. In the nonscientific publications field, the AMA publishes Today's Health, a monthly consumer magazine, and the AMA News, a fortnightly medical news- paper which reaches more physicians than any other medical publication. Periodically the AMA publishes the \"American Medical Directory,\" undisputed reference of the medical profession, giving biographical and educational infor- mation about all licensed physicians in the United States. This volume was first published in 1906. Annually AMA publishes cumulated \"Index Medicus, an index to medical books and periodical literature published throughout the world. This publica- tion gives permanence to the medical literature of today, carrying forward the knowledge of this generation to the scientific workers of the ages to come. \"New and Nonofficial Drugs,\" a book published annually, contains a compila- tion of available information on drugs, including their therapeutic, prophylatic and diagnostic status, as evaluated by A-MA's Council on Drugs. The lengthy list of AMA publications, including pamphlets, reprints, and re- ports, earns for the association the title of one of the world's leading scientific publishers. Scientific rneetings.-AMA's annual and clinical meetings, held each June and December, are the most important postgraduate medical study sessions in the world. The meetings encompass some 400 scientific lectures; between 350 and 400 scientific exhibits; 300 to 400 industrial exhibits illustrating new drugs. equipment, and books; outstanding scientific films and special closed-circuit television presentations. In addition throughout the year there are many seminars, symposia and other meetings of a postgraduate nature on specific topics. Council, committees.-AMA makes one of its greatest contributions to medi- cine by gathering data on new products, new findings, and new methods-cor- relating, evaluating, and summarizing it-and channeling it to members. A number of scientific councils and committees, each composed of leading physicians serving without remuneration, carry on this work with the aid of headquarters staff. Between 700 to 800 physicians, representing every section of the country, serve on these councils and committees. The AMA councils on drugs, foods and nutrition, medical education andhospitals, medical physics, medical service, mental health, national security, occupational health, rural health, legislative activities, constitution and bylaws, scientific assembly and judicial matters. There are AMA committees on cosmetics, medical aspects of automobile in- juries, medical aspects of sports, medical practices, medical rating of physical impairment, liaison with national nursing organizations, medicolegal problems, voluntary health agencies, aging, Federal medical services, indigent care, insur- ance and prepayment plans, maternal and child care, medical facilities, alcohol- ism, hypnosis, narcotic addiction, disaster medical care, military medical affairs, aerospace medicine, fractures, and other equally important subjects. In addition there are 17 residency review committees covering the various specialties, liaison committees and advisory committees in various fields. Scientific assemblV sections.-These include anesthesiology; dermatology; diseases of the ology. records.-AMA's medical library is comprised of an internation- al collection of some 1,600 periodicals on basic medical science and clinicalmedicine and nearly 200,000 pamphlets and reprints. It offers free to members a periodical lending service and package library service. AMA also \"reads\" hundreds of foreign medical journals for physicians, ab- stracting significant articles. The association maintains a medical film library of more than 2.50 subjectsand has the largest source file of medical films in the United States-more than 2,500 indexed references. AMA's Department of Investigation has one of the largest collections ofnostrums and quack gadgets and medicines in the United States and maintainsthe largest files existent on medical quackery.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 57 AMA's records department keeps complete records on all licensed physicians. These information files are begun as soon as a student enters medical school and are kept for some years after a physician's death. These records are the most complete of any profession. The association also maintains an extensive library of legal briefs on medico- legal cases plus other medicolegal information and materials. Other AMA departments have films, exhibits, and extensive files on specific subjects. What the AMA does.-AMA is a nonprofit, public service institution, organized to protect the public health and to promote the highest quality medical care for the American people. It helps physicians keep up to date on every phase of modern medicine and serves the American public In a thousand unseen ways each day. The association's activities are many and varied. To help physicians in their practice of medicine, the AMA-- Provides early unbiased information on all types of new drugs; evaluates physical methods and apparatus intended for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease; sponsors two huge postgraduate meetings annually and many special symposia and conferences; publishes 11 scientific journals and a medical newspaper; maintains a physicians question and answer service; works for higher standards of internship and residency training: exerts leadership to solve medical problems as they arise and serves as a vast clearinghouse on scientific medicine; studies the ever-increasing prob- lems related to the nonscientific side of medicine, probing questions and developing action programs; maintains extensive libraries and library lending serivces; provides office planning guides and practical aids; studies and reports on patterns of practice; publishes pamphlets for distribution to patients; serves as clearinghouse for information on State legislation of medical interest, and analyzes medical legislation introduced in Congress: keeps up-to-date records on all physicians: offers scores of other services de- signed to keep the physician abreast of the times and to help him practice the best medicine. AMA assures high-caliber medicine by- Waging constant war on medical quackery, helping educate the public about dangers of quackery and serving as source of information to Govern- ment agencies and others to help bring quacks to justice; inspecting medical schools periodically, evaluating curriculum, teaching staff, physical and clinical facilities and administration to maintain high standards in medical schools; cooperating with Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals to maintain high hospital standards; promoting research; encouraging ad- herence to highest standards of medical ethics; initiating or supporting legislation which is in the best public interest; opposing legislation which in its opinion would result in lower quality health care. AMIA serves the public by- Studying usefulness, limitations and health problems of cosmetic prep- arations; evaluating foods and special food products, pesticides and chem- icals to assure safety; getting physicians into small communities and rural areas via placement service; answering between 12,000 and 15,000 personal letters on health subjects each year and using every medium of commnu- nicatiomns in its health education program for the public; inviting in- terested representatives from the public to attend conferences on rural health, industrial health, and school health; maintaining loan collection of health exhibits and films; encouraging high standards in advertising and labeling of foods and drugs; vorking closely with schools and edu- eators to help provide for pupils' health needs; conducting public educa- tional campaigns on traffic safety, use of seat belts, ways to reduce acci- dental poisonings and accidents and many other subjects; working with industry to control health hazards on the job, rehabilitation of disabled workers; alerting the public to the importance of preparing for any emerg- ency resulting from a national disaster; helping rural communities improve their health environment; developing standards for nursing homes to assure safe care for patients; publishing Today's Health magazine; producing films, radio transcriptions. TX' shows. and exhibits on health subjects; serv- ing as a watchdog of medical standards. AMA's arcom-plishmecnts.-For more than a century, the American Medieal Association has dedicated itself to furthering the interests of the Nation's health58 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN and has developed a large number of activities, all of which directly or indirectly have contributed to making America one of the healthiest nations in the world. Since its organization, in 1847, there has been no major public health problem in the United States in which the AM1A has not played a significant role. To enumerate all of the association's accomplishments would require a huge volume. Listed here are highlights of a cross-section of these contributions: MEDICAL EDUCATION Since 1847, ALMA has worked to improve the Nation's medical schools. Its activities led to the housecleaning between 1905 and 1920 of medical \"diploma mills.\" Since then, AMA and the Association of American Medical Colleges have periodically inspected all schools to make certain high standards are maintained. Every year AMIA compiles and publishes valuable data encompassing all facets of medical education. It sponsors an annual congress on medical education and licensure. As early as 1922, AM1A recognized the need for more medical schools and has encouraged the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of new ones. In 1871 AMA took the first step toward certifying boards for specialists. Four years later it urged endowments to medical schools. Financial assistance to medical schools is provided through the American Medical Association Education and Research Foundation. Since 1952 physicians have contributed more than $11 million to aid medical schools. Total 1961 contributions were $1,303,161. The foundation has four additional programs: medical journalism fellowships. research grants, perinatal mortality and morbidity study, and a study of con- tinuing medical education. AMIA-ERF is developing a medical scholarship program and in 1962 inaugurated a loan program for medical students, as well as physicians in internships and residencies. AMA approved \"evaluation of the medical qualifications of the individual foreign-trained physician who wishes to come to the United States\" and \"Con- siders certification by the Educational Council for Foreign Medical Graduates (formed in 1957) as evidence that the recipient of certification is possessed of medical knowledge comparable to that expected of graduates of approved medical schools in the United States and Canada * * *.\" To assure the best possible medical care for all the people, AM1A expects graduates of foreign medical schools serving as interns or residents in U.S. hospitals to have been certified by ECFMIG. Because of these continuous efforts to elevate medical education standards. America's physicians are among the best trained in the world. ACTION AGAINST QUACKERY Carrying out one of the original purposes of AMA is the department of investi- gation which, since 1906, has carried on a relentless fight against quacks and charlatans and their nostrums and gadgets. The department. which has the largest files existent on medical quackery, has been most effective in revealing facts concerning unethical and fraudulent practices and in providing regulatory bodies with evidence leading to conviction. Consequently over the years AMA has been sued for several million dollars in damages. It lost but one case and damages of 1 cent were awarded. GUIDANCE ON DRUGS Another of A'MA's major accomplishments has been its long and constructive influence in behalf of greater scientific accuracy and more dependable thera- peutic agents. A year after AMIA was founded, 1848, a resolution pointed out the dangers of universal traffic in secret remedies and patent medicines. AMA's leadership, backed by certain standards of discipline, brought about new conceiuts of pharmaceutical integrity. AMIA's Council on Drugs was established in 1905, primarily to police the widespread drug advertising which promoted false claims and secrecy of formulas. To this day, AMlA's publications have rigid standards governing the acceptance of advertising.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 59 As early as 1849, AMIA supported establishment of schools of pharmacy, estab-lishment of a board \"to analyze quack remedies and nostrums\" and \"to enlighten the public in regard to the nature and dangerous tendencies of such remedies.\"Passage of pure food, drugs, and cosmetics laws were in large measure attributableto effects of AMIA. In 1905, the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry was created to analyze drugs, publishing the results. The AMIA provides physicians with early unbiased information on all typesof new drugs and prepares special reports on the current status of therapy in disease. The council's motto \"not for ourselves, but for medicine,\" characterizes itsefforts over more than a half century in behalf of better medicine. MEDICAL SERVICE In 1943 AM1A established a Council on Medical Service \"to make availablefacts, data, and medical opinions with respect to timely and adequate renditionof medical care to the American people.\" The council's accomplishments have been numerous and noteworthy. Its many constructive programs have included: Development of voluntary health insurance and prepayment plans as the best mechanisms for paying for medical and hospital care. (AMA first beganstudy of health insurance in 1913.) I)evelopment of guides for revaluating medical care programs for those finan-cially unable to pay their own way and continually seeking ways to improveexisting plans while maintaining high quality care. (The medical profession is dedicated to the provision of medical service for all, regardless of ability tu pay.

FOODS AND NUTRITION AMA provided early leadership in the movement to make proper use of vita- mins and minerals to improve the nutritive quality of staple foods. In 1915 itparticipated in helping improve the quality of milk supplied to the Nation. Itplayed an important role in fortifying milk with vitamin D, which became aprinicipal factor contributing to the decline of rickets in this country; in develop-ing enriched flour. one of the notable public health movements of that decade;of developing iodized salt; fruit juices containing high natural levels of vitamin C. and canned baby foods. Rapid expansion of the science (if foods and nutrition since the turn of thecentury has been dramatic and far reaching in its applications and AMIA madea vital contribution in this development.60 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN ETHICAL CONDUCT One of the paramount reasons for founding the AMA was to develop an accepted code of ethical conduct for physicians. The present AMA Principles of Medical Ethics have been evolved through the years by action of the House of Delegates. These principles, which are \"not laws to govern but are principles to guide to correct conduct,\" contain much specific advice on how to maintain ethical relations with patients and with other physicians. They have been set down primarily for the good of the public. but they also serve as an inspiration to the physician to remain true to his oath. In addition, the Principles of Medical Ethics are augmented by the interpre- tations of the AMA Judicial Council. These interpretations are published in the Journal of the AMA and compiled periodically in the Opinions and Reports of the Judicial Council. BOARDS AND DEPARTMENTS AMA has fostered public health facilities throughout the Nation. Eighty-nine years ago it urged establishment of State boards of health. Two years later it worked for formation of a complete system of State and county medical societies and an international medical society. As early as 1912, AMA urged establish- ment of a department of health in the President's cabinet, which later led to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. It also recommended creation of the U.S. Public Health Service, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, and in 1948 participated in the development of the World Medical Association. SCIENTIFIC EXHIBITS Physicians attending the 1899 AMA meeting saw the first scientific exhibit at a national medical meeting in this country. The exhibit was on pathology and caused so much comment that scientific exhibits soon became one of the most significant and important developments for the advancement of medical science. Today there are from 350 to 400 scientific exhibits at AMA's annual and clinical meetings. HEALTH EDUCATION In 1882 the AMA urged State legislatures to introduce hygiene as one of the branches to be taught in the schools. Today, through a long and mutually profit- able joint committee with the National Education Association, it edits a standard textbook on the teaching of health in the schools. Its staff physicians answer questions on school health from educators and schools, it sponsors conferences on physicians and schools, and maintains a year-round school health program. In 1878, AMA urged better education of the public in regard to health. Through continuing programs of public education and communication, the American people today know more about their health and how to preserve it than ever before. AMA's activities in this area include exhibits, films, pam- phlets, radio and TV programs, Today's Health magazine, articles in news- papers and magazines, conferences and meetings, and a letter-answering service. LEGISLATION Another important way in which the AAMA paves the way toward better health care for the people is by supporting sound medical legislation and by opposing measures which it believes would lower the quality of medical care or would not be in the best public interest. Through its Washington office, legislative department, and council on legis- lative activities, it analyzes all legislation pertaining to medicine and health and supports far more legislation than it opposes. In recent years, it has supported: The Kerr-Mills medical aid for the aged law passed in 1960 and worked actively toward-its-implementation in the States. Hill-Burton hospital construction programs. The passage and strengthening of the pure food and drug laws. The White House Conference on Aging in 1961. FHA mortgage guarantees to stimulate construction of more nursing homes.

A bill which would provide for the regulation of interstate distribution and sale of hazardous substances intended or suitable for household use. Endorsed the principle of a program of voluntary, contributory health in- surance for Federal employees. During the first session of the 87th Congress, AMA testified or submitted statements in suport of four measures-Federal grants for medical school con- struction, tax deductions for the self-employed on funds used for establishing retirement programs, Defense Department appropriation for fallout shelters. safety standards for Government-purchased vehicles. AMA opposed three ineasures-King-Anderson proposals for medical care under social security. drug control bill. a proposal involving prescription drug advertising. Through the years, AMNIA has recommended hundreds of legislative proposals, including: Recommended in the 1850's adoption by State governments of \"measures for procuring a registration of births, marriages, and deaths.\" And since then has supported measures for securing standard nomenclature and more efficient report- ing of vital statistics. Its efforts paved the way for passage of food, drug, and cosmetic laws. Supported the medical examiner system to replace the antiquated coroner system. Recommended in 1874 that people should not be allowed to marry until they obtain a certificate showing that they did not have syphilis. In 1903, AMA was concerned about excessive injuries caused by fireworks and started a campaign which led to laws regulating the use of fireworks in celebrating the Fourth of July. It opposed repeal by Congress in 1916 of the Daylight Saving Act expressing an opinion that the act was \"'wholly beneficial to national health because it lengthened the hours of recreation in the open air.\" In 1874, it determined the most feasible plan for securing legislation to prevent the spread of syphilis. As early as 1884 it supported experimentation on animals as the most useful source of knowledge in medical practice. (If policies of restriction and pro- hibition had been followed, they would have forbidden the discovery of antitoxin, insulin, and a number of other valuable agents whose therapeutic properties were humanely demonstrated on laboratory animals.) It recognized the weakness in the antinarcotic law of 1914, which permitted sale and use of narcotics when contained in proprietary and stock preparations, and urged Congress to amend the law. Its close review of all health legislation has resulted in similar findings through the years. In 1860, it urged action by legislatures in every State against illegal abortion. AMIA also has proposed model laws for, consideration by State legislators such as measures to authorize post morten examination and blood test regulations. Since passage of a law is just one step toward putting it into effect, much of further interpretation of the law. promulgation of regulations, and determina- tion of practical policies fall to the administrative agencies concerned. AMIA works closely with these offices in an advisory capacity-just one further indica- tion of its concern for the advancememit of public health in America. MISCELLANEOUS Other AMlA accomplishments include encouragement of medical scientific research and its own allocation of hundreds of thousands of dollars for funda- mental investigations; one of fire organizations making up the Joint Comulmis- sion on the Accreditation of Hospitals which is responsible for the inspection of hospitals; inspection and approval of schools for laboratory technicians, occupa- 94703 0-63-pt. 1-562 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN EXHIBIT 2 [Chicago Tribune, January 8, 1953] Real Relief from CONSTIPATION AW3S As you get older, your system nat- urally slows down and the laxative you've been using may no longer be bestor you.

[From Today's Health, October 1960] ExHIBIT 3 LAXATIVES: A $148 MILLIoN FRAUD? (By Charles W. Hock, M.D.) It is estimated that 6 out of. every 10 Americans take laxatives or enemasfrequently. A minimum of 100 million persons in our Nation have come torely on such unnatural elimination aids. In 1958, says Drug Topics magazine, $148,880,000 was spent by Americans forlaxatives and elimination aids alone. The surest smiles of satisfaction resultingfrom these dollars were on the faces of laxative promoters as they totaled upsales. Old-fashioned habits, half-truths, and incorrect beliefs, and today's advertis-ing have brainwashed the American public to accept the idea that a daily bowelmovement is a necessity for everyone. Your doctor knows nothing could be further from the truth. He knows a dailybowel movement is not essential for many people and trying to bring it aboutcan be dangerous. While most people do have a bowel movement once a day, this is normal forthem rather than being a requirement. If a person does not normally have abowel movement every day, it is a mistake, and even dangerous, to force thisabnormal \"normality.\" Daily, pediatricians are seeing children who have scarcely ever had a normalmovement. Many of the mothers have made such a fetish of early toilettraining and \"regularity\" they insist on giving soap (or other) suppositories tothe infant at a certain time each day to \"train\" the child to have a movementat that particularly convenient (for the mother) time. Other mothers rely on such aids because they think the child is feverish, catch-ing cold, cranky, or for a variety of other symptoms, most of which do notessentially have to do with evacuating the bowel. It does not take long for an infant's intestinal tract to rely on assistance.After long use of laxatives and enemas, the bowel becomes lazy and expects to be stimulated into action. All too often physicians see persons who have been dosing with laxatives,purges, or taking enemas when the long-endured constipation was actually asign of far-advanced rectal cancer. Why do Americans worry so much about \"regularity\" (as they call a daily bowel movement)? This idea has been swept down the ages on a tide ofpatent medicines. In ancient times, purging with strong herbs was a part of certain religious ceremonies; the earliest physicians used laxatives and purges to a wide extent.This treatment was continued by many physicians in the latter part of the19th century. As recently as 1895, a home guide, \"The People's Common Sense MedicalAdvisor,\" warned, \"If fecal matters are retained until they are decomposed,great injury follows, since the fluid portions are absorbed, conveyed into the64 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN blood. and of necessity. corrupt it with their impurities. In this way, constina- tion may be the source of general derangement. but such disorder is seldom attributed to the torpid state of the intestine. \"Sometimes the blood becomes so charged with fecal matter that its odor can be detected in the breath of the subject.\" With such \"medical guides\" on hand, and with the doctors relying on enemas and laxatives, it is little wonder the American public became laxative and enema conscious. The public rapidly took up this \"treatment\" and admin- istered it frequently. Purveyors of patent medicines rapidly replaced home-brewed laxatives with their own nostrums. In the early 1900's, medical science proved poisons and toxins would not be absorbed from the bowel. Unfortunately, however, by this time the public had \"learned\" about laxa- tives and enemas. They had (with the help of patent-medicine and health-food advertising) become convinced that a daily bowel movement or \"regularity\" was a vital necessity. Today. we know a person is constipated only when the bowel movement Is hard and dry. and in the shape of balls. Constipation has nothing to do with the length of time that has elapsed between movements. The retention of fecal matter in the colon for long periods of time has been noted on many occasions. One of the best known examples in recent times was an American general during his imprisonment by the Japanese. He went over 100 days without having a bowel movement and without any ill effects that could be attributed directly to this. Unless American women now awaken to the danger of self-medication and continued treatment with laxatives and the use of frequent enemas, cases such as that of Helen H. will become even more common in years to come. Helen was born in an average American home, had an average childhood and early adulthood. Her mother, however, was a great believer in laxatives or enemas for any and every condition. Helen had rather frequent headaches when she was in her teens. These headaches occurred when she became nervous or tense before an examination. before a date with a new boy friend, or under many of the situations a normal young girl encounters. Whenever Helen had one of these tension headaches, her mother promptly gave her a laxative. telling her, \"It will clean out the body. Your head aches because you are constipated.\" If Helen had an examination at school and woke in the morning with a head- ache, her mother gave her a laxative. Helen took the examination. her head- ache subsided, and that afternoon, the laxative worked-and was given credit for curing the headache. The frequency with which such laxatives were taken was gradually increased until now, at the age of 24. Helen is. or thinks she is, absolutely dependent on laxatives. The result of her mother's teaching is that Helen now has a \"reflex headache\" which will come on her each time the rectum is filled and she does not promptly evacuate it. During a recent conference, I asked my colleagues if they, too, were seeing an increase in patients who were \"addicted\" to laxatives or enemas. Some of these physicians claimed that as high as 90 percent of their patients were using such aids to extremes. The consensus was that people today must be taught to leave their digestive and elimination systems alone. There are also patients who complain that although they are \"regular,\" they do not eliminate enough. Bob is such an example. He was not originally both- ered with \"irregularity.\" He simply worried that his movements were not \"large enough.\" Aided and abetted by his wife (and perhaps at her complete insistence). Bob undertook to help himself have larger bowel movements. He started with laxatives. The first day. Bob got \"good results.\" On the second day, there was no move- ment, nor was there on the third day, so Bob and his wife convinced themselves that he was \"constipated.\" He did not know that when his harsh laxative cleaned his intestinal tract on the first day, he could expect to wait 3 days until a normal movement could occur. Bob did not give his intestines a chance to act on their own. It normally takes 2 or 3 days for a meal to pass through the processes of digestion, through the Intestinal tract and into the rectum for evacuation.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 65 Instead of waiting, Bob took additional laxatives. He progressed to stronger laxatives, and finally to \"high colonic\" enemas. In time, his large intestine be- canme lazy and expected the laxatives and enemas to do its work. Some patients could literally take a dose of epsom salts, castor oil, and calomel at the same time, anid still not get an elimination from these harsh laxatives. While the patent medicine men have had their field day selling laxatives and purgatives, the chiropractors, naturopaths, and food faddists have found a new wealth in the America n worry over \"regularity.\" The giving of massive enemas (usually referred to as \"high colonic irrigation\") gives patients \"results\" right in the office. I know of one practitioner who had various contraptions of glass and plastic tubing to show the patient the excre- ment as the practitioner said, \"Now here is the fried fish you ate some months ago. It has been in there all the time, poisoning your system.\" The uneducated and unwary believe this. Even if the patient does not feel \"relieved\" of his symptoms, he at least feels pounds lighter after the treatment. In most States, these practitioners have been forbidden the right to perform surgical operations and the right to give radical treatments of most types. There is no legislation that can forbid them the right to give enemas complete with. glass and plastic \"viewing\" contraptions. Food faddists are often as dangerous. 'Many harsh bran foods sold for \"regu- larity\" simply do added damage to the hesitant intestinal tract by roughly forc- hig the contents along. Genuine constipation is generally caused by overactivity of the digestive tract rather than underactivity. Worries and anxieties often cause the bowel to move too fast and go into spasm or cramp. When the bowel does go into a spasm or a cramp, constipation results. This spasm or cramp may be so slight it will not cause pain, but will prevent the intestinal debris from moving down the large bowel (colon) at the rate it should, and the bowel movement progresses too slowly into the rectmn. During this slow passage, the waste matter has excessive water taken from it and becomes hard and dry. If the bowel moves too fast but does not go into a spasm, the patient will usually have diarrhea. Another worry of many patients is the color of the movement. This will vary greatly depending upon the foods eaten and upon other factors. Only in two major instances is the color significant. One is a \"tarry\" bowel movement, which is black and shiny like tar, dlue to bleeding. in the gastrointestinal tract. The second is a clay-colored movement (a grayish white) generally present when a person has some disease of the liver, gall bladder, or pancreas. In either case the family doctor should be consulted without delay. The family doctor should be-consulted if real constipation does occur; if the bowel movements are hard and dry and in the shape of balls. The doctor will make certain there is no associated organic disease by taking :i complete history and making a physical examination. This examination may include blood counts, urinalysis, proctoscopic examination (an examination of the inside of the rectum) and in many instances X-rays of the upper digestive tract, and an X-ray examination of the colon. In some cases, X-rays of the gall bladder and other examinations also may be needed. The doctor's treatment for constipation will be simple and effective when his studies show there is no organic disease present. Instructions to patients are simple: 1. Drink at least eight full glasses of water a day to assure enough water for the body's needs and for the stool to have an adequate amount of water to be soft. A ncrmnal bowel movement is approximately 65 percent water, and many patients have never developed the habit of drinking enough water. The body will not allow the bowel to keep water if it is needed or some other vital organ or function of the body. 2. The patient's diet must contain an adequate amount of protein, carbo- hydrates, and fat, and should contain two or three dishes of cooked or canned (already cooked) vegetables and two or three dishes of cooked fruits. The diet should avoid fried foods, highly seasoned foods, and the irritating or bulk producing foods, including many raw fruits and vegetables, alcohol, carbonated beverages, many \"greens\" and irritants such as bran. 3. The patient must give up all \"medications\" of his own. In the majority of instances, the surest (and fastest) treatment for \"consti- pation\" and \"irregularity\" is simply to let the digestive system pursue its normal course.66 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN [From Today's Health, November 1962] EXHIBIT 4 AMERICA'S LAXATIVE ADDICTS BRAINWASHED BY MISLEADING ADVERTISING, AMERICANS SPEND $146 MILLION A YEAR ON LAXATIVES, YET THEIR INDISCRIMINATE USE IS FOOLISH-SONMETINES DANGEROUS (By J. D. Ratcliff) Certain radio and TV \"bathroom commercials,\" milestones of bad taste, drum relentlessly on the virtues of \"regularity\"-suggesting that radiant good health. new vigor, and clear skin are to be achieved by taking some patellted medicine. Newspaper and magazine ads stress the same theme. Result? Says one doctor: \"We are becoming a nation of bowel neurotics.\" Adds another: \"The ill effects of the abuse of laxatives and purgatives are far greater than the imagined ill effects of constipation.\" Writing in Today's Health (October 1960), Dr. Charles W. Hock observed: \"Americans have been brainwashed into accepting the idea that a daily bowel movement is a necessity.\" Various surveys suggest that as many as 100 million Amnericans have become laxative addicts. Sales figures tend to confirm this. In 1950, sales stood at $125 million. Figures collected by Drug Topics indicate sales of $1.57 million in 1960. Last year the American people spent $162 million for laxatives. Indiscriminate use of laxatives is foolish, sometimes dangerous. They inter- fere with the proper absorption of foods in the small intestine, and resorption of critically important sodium and potassium in the large intestine. Mineral oils pick up such oil-soluble vitamins as A and D and sweep them out of the body: and all laxatives depress production of the B vitamins by bacteria which nor- mally inhabit the large intestine. At times, laxatives mask more important diseases in which constipation is a symptom. For example: intestinal diverticula-pouchy traps that sometimes form along the intestine-become impacted with food, then infected. Or, laxa- tives can muffle the alarm signals of kinked intestines, ulcers, and sometimes even cancer. Many widely used laxatives are powerful irritants. If used regularly they overstimulate intestinal muscles to a point of flaccid exhaustion-normal activity is no longer possible. Thus, they actually cause the constipation they are supposed to combat. Seventeenth century physicians had few medicines on which they could depend for quick, visible results. Purges were prescribed for virtually all patients- on the theory that if recovery followed, the doctor would get credit, and if not, no harm would be done. Early this century public imagination was captured by \"auto-intoxication - the theory that retained intestinal wastes poisoned the blood, led to headache, fatigue, and other misery. Wiser physicians pointed out that if a true systemic poisoning were present it wouldn't vanish with a bowel movement-any more than a drunk is instantly sobered by vomiting. Any poisons that are present are converted into harmless compounds and disposed of by the liver and kidneys. Experimental proof was presented. Lower segments of colons of volunteers were packed with sterile cotton-enough to produce distention. Obviously, the cotton contained no poisons but it produced the same headachy symptoms as \"auto-intoxication.\" Distention alone, it bacame clear, was the culprit. Although discredited years ago, the idea of \"poisons\" in the intestinal tract still retains a firm grip on the public mind. 'Millions of people believe that the colon (large intestine) requires regular flushing. Preoccupation with such notions often produces bowel neurosis. Writing in the Journal of the Medical Society of New Jersey, Dr. Charles WI. Lewis observes of bowel neurotics: \"They are convinced that without one move- ment a day they are doomed to a life of invalidism. Many are satisfied only with three or more to be certain that 'each meal is eliminated.' These patients must learn that regularity varies. There is no universally normal pattern. It is not unusual for an individual to have only one movement a week.\" A clearer understanding of our remarkable inner tubes-intestinal tracts- can do much to dispel many of the false ideas some laxative manufacturers find it profitable to perpetuate. For all practical purposes the tract is apart from the body-in the sense that a tunnel through a mountainside which hasFRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 67 none of the watercourses, root structures, or mineral deposits of the mountain itself Is apart from the mountain. Many things which are harmless in the intestine-acids, alkalis, bacteria- could not be tolerated by the blood or by organs \"inside\" the body. Even deadly rattlesnake venom is harmless in the digestive tract. Nature displayed her usual generosity in providing us with 20-25 feet of small intestine. We can get along quite comfortably with far less. Most surgeons deem 5 feet sufficient to care for all bodily needs and in some extreme cases have left as little as 14 inches after extensive cancer surgery. Yet, after stormy recovery periods, many such patients have adjusted to new conditions and managed comfortably. Although the small intestine looks like a singularly unimpressive sausage casing, it is in reality a remarkable chemical factory. Injected into the blood stream, a meal of steak, potatoes, and pie would be deadly as cyanide. The small intestine breaks down such foods into components which can be utilized by tissues and organs. With the help of a daily pint to quart of bile from the liver, plus an equal amount of digestive juice from the pancreas, the small intestine performs chem- ical magic-converting starch into usable sugars, proteins into amino acids, and fats into fatty acids. The process is speeded by 5 to 10 quarts of daily secretion from the small intestine's 20 million minute glands. Foods are churned by the tubular mixing bowl's intricate complex of muscles. Churning motions will continue, for example, for perhaps 30 minutes in a seg- ment a few inches long. Then the food is moved along by peristaltic muscles- their action is much like that of running a finger over a soft rubber tube. Then mixing continues in the new location. Millions of microscopic villi in the lining of the intestine absorb digested proteins and carbohydrates into the bloodstream, and fats into the lymphatic ,.ystemn. The time required for the small intestine to work its chemical wonders varies-maybe as little as 3 hours, possibly as long as 15. But eventually a gruel, from which virtually all food has been removed, reaches the large intes- tine. At this point the gruel consists almost entirely of mucus and cells shed from the intestinal wall, plus undigested food residues. In the 5- to 6-foot large intestine, events proceed at a more leisurely pace- its digestive function requires 3 to 4 hours, sometimes more. While the small intestine i-, largely sterile. the large one teems with bacteria. Most are friends. not enemies-manufacturing the valuable B and K vitamins, possibly others. The chief function of the large intestine, or colon, is to extract water and salts from the material received from the small intestine. But for this, the body would be thrown out of its critically important fluid and mineral balance. Indeed, most of the babies who die of infantile diarrhea perish from dehydra- tion-food passes through the large intestine so rapidly there isn't time for it to extract the water. When laxatives push foods through the large intestine too rapidly, precious potassium is lost. If the loss is mild, nothing more than mius- cular weakness is felt. If severe, breathing muscles and heart may be hit. Once its work is done, the large intestine passes residues along to its final 6-inch segment, the rectum. This glistening pink tube is insensitive to heat, to pinching, to electric shock. But it is sensitive to distention. Normally empty. it reacts when filled with the end products of digestion. With distention it sends out an alarm signal, triggers the defecation reflex. We become conscious of the fact that there are wastes to be disposed of. This is the chain of normal activity along the intestinal tract. Many things can upset it. Nervous tension and anger are prime offenders. Long ago, re- searchers observed the intestinal churning of a cat on a fluoroscope screen. When a barking dog was brought into the laboratory all digestive activity ceased. With help of a sigmoidoscope-a tubular instrument with which it is possible to look directly into the colon-researchers took observations on medical student volunteers. When the students were angered or worried, the normally pink tube became beet red. went into board-like spasm. Such spasm-now dubbed \"irritable colon\"-slows or halts normal bowel activity and allows the lower in- testine to absorb too much fluid from wastes passing through it. Constipation may follow.68 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN Today, doctors tend to believe that worry is the chief culprit. Further, they believe that excessive worry about elimination can be the chief cause of con- stipation. TV commercials and alarmist ads in newspapers and magazines, of course, encourage us to have these worries. Observes Dr. Sanford M. Lewis of Newark, N.J.: \"It is not the colon which needs treatment but the man who surrounds it.\" In the typical case, a person frets about missing a movement for a day or so. A laxative is taken, which empties the entire tract. Most people fail to realize that it will take perhaps 3 days for the tract to again fill and resume normal function. Noting lack of activity during this period, the person takes another laxative. Thus the first steps toward becoming a laxative addict are taken. Laxatives and cathartics fall into three general classes: mineral oils, which act as mild lubricants saline cathartics (epsom salts, citrate of magnesia, and mineral waters), which draw water from the tissues into the intestine; irritating drugs, which inflame the intestinal wall, causing increased motility (cascara, senna, and phenolphthalein, which are widely used in patented drugs). All have essentially the same drawback in varying degree. With continued use, natural function diminishes and, in extreme cases, disappears. Thus the individual finds it necessary to use these products almost daily to obtain an evacuation of the digestive tract. The misuse of these drugs is beginning to assume truly alarming proportions. A study quoted not long ago by Britain's Consumer's Association showed that a fourth of mothers questioned gave children laxatives on a regular basis- whether they needed them or not. Reason: They wanted to prevent constipation. Many adults subscribe to the same fallacious notions, feeling that they need a \"cleaning out\" at regular intervals. Nothing, of course, is \"cleaned.\" All that is accomplished is the disruption of the vitally important digestive process. Where the medical profession once prescribed cathartics freely, caution is the rule today. Dr. Alastair G. Macgregor of the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, expresses the view of the great majority of physicians: \"The efforts of doctors are fMr more likely to be directed to correcting faults caused by the abuse of purgatives than to prescribing them.\" There are, of course, situations in which the use of laxatives or the more powerful cathartics is perfectly valid: emptying the intestinal tract in prepara- tion for X-rays or surgery in hospital patients whose digestions have grown sluggish from lack of exercise; in many older people whose digestive tracts have been So abused that normal function is no longer possible. If the use of laxatives were restricted to cases of this type, sales would be only a minute fraction of whaf they are today. How can the insidious laxative habit be broken? Doctors usually advise ample fluids, perhaps six glasses of water a day; a diet containing ample quan- tities of cooked fruits and leafy vegetables to provide roughage; and the immediate response to nature's call when it comes. Repeated postponement can, indeed, actually lead to constipation. The body is an orderly machine and welcomesan orderly regimen. Increasingly, doctors are stressing a point which should be a guiding principle for all of us: Let the intestinal tract alone. It is quite capable of taking care of itself. And if difficulties do arise, go to a doctor. He is better able to prescribe than some advertising pitchman.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 69 EXHIBIT 5 ,oftll~O ~ totlOttOl~ot 05005000 0to00 A Frank Statement' f to Tired Men and Women * Who Are Over 35 By * 0.0 0 tit 14000*blo d sb,o,1 N-o~ Blood Fo, Old .1 olouoo ho The L l04i ..oho be Yoo ** oo flood .0,0ooo o fook s dot Ib 0 bo .T .totooo.

But hucksters who prey on the pocket- books of hopeful arthritics reap a multimillion-dollar harvest through the promotion of sea water, \"immune milk,\" alfalfa tablets, and other worthless treatments. (By Kenneth N. Anderson) Arthritis is not a disease that is likely to kill you. But people who are stricken by some forms of arthritis often wvish it were fatal. It can be painful beyond the imagination of those who have not experienced attacks of the ail- ment. In its severe ravages, victims are unable to endure the mere touch of a bedsheet. If not diagnosed and treated correctly in time, arthritis can cripple. Rheumatoid arthritis may cause muscles to wither and joints to fuse in one solid mass. SEVEN HUNDRED NEW VICTIMS EVERY DAY Arthritis attacks like a sadistic ghost. It moves unseen into the body. It may torture a patient for a few days, then vanish. Or it may return again and again. It defies a specific cure. If it is transmitted by bacteria or virus, the organism has never been seen. Yet nearly 12 million Americans suffer from arthritis, and citizens of all ages and backgrounds are joining the long list of victims at the rate of 700 per day. Because arthritis is such an elusive ailment, as far as cause and cure are con- cerned, and its pain so vivid, arthritics easily become targets for unscrupulous promoters of quack therapy. No quack \"cure\" apparently is too outlandish or too costly for the desperate victim of arthritis, despite the fact that his own family doctor can help the patient to obtain the newest medicines and methods of treatment that reduce pain and swelling and restore use of the affected joints. For example, the Arthritis & Rheumatism Foundation estimates that around 5 million Americans spend $252 million a year for misrepresented products offered to cure or relieve arthritis. This amounts to an average of $50 p-er victim spent each year for items ranging from filtered sea water to alfalfa tablets. DELAY CAN CAUSE CRIPPLING Ironically, the money wasted on useless treatment for arthritis far exceeds the private funds available for scientific research into the cause of arthritis and its cure. A year ago, the foundation dispensed a total of $800,000 for arthritis research. The same amount wvas spent in 1 year to advertise a single brand of arthritis medicine on network television. Many of the products advertised are harmless, except that time and money wasted on such self-medication may delay proper medical treatment. And de- laying medical treatment may result in needless crippling of arthritis patients- the majority of whom can be helped with modern steroids and other drugs that are not advertised on TN' or in newspaper or pulp magazines. SEA WATER AT $3 A PINT Some of the misrepresented products, however, can be quite harmful for arthritics, or even normal persons. One such product cited by R. W. Lamont- Havers, M.D., medical director of the Arthritis & Rheumatism Foundation, is sea water. Sea water, condensed to 10 times its normal concentration of minerals, has been sold throughout the country and advertised in newspapers at prices of around $3 a pint. One advertisement begins: \"Hundreds of longtime arthritic suffers and many others suffering from deficiency ailments have praised this miracle of nature for its relief giving rejuvenation of pain-ridden bodies.\" Pro- motion of the sea water implies that numerous ailments including \"unsightly adolescent face pimples\" as wvell as cancer, diabetes, gray hair, baldness, and arthritis are caused by a lack of minerals in the human body and these minerals can be supplied by drinking sea water.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 93 Some patients who have been taking this sea water, says Dr. Lamont-Havers, are coining to their physicians with \"waterlogging\" of the body. \"This is caused by the excessive intake of salt and could have very serious consequences in patients with heart and kidney disease. There is also danger of infection from unpasteurized sea water.\" ADDED MINERALS CANNOT HELP Nutritional and curative claims made for commercially prepared mineral sea salts have also been debunked by the American Medical Association. \"These claims are typical of the claims made by food faddists regarding minerals in our diet,\" said Ogden C. Johnson, Ph. D., of the AMA's Council on Foods and Nutrition. Writing in the AMIA Journal, he continued: \"The average mixed American diet contains adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals. The importance of such minerals as iodine, copper, and iron in our diet has been demonstrated, but except for iodine and iron it is not possible to demonstrate a deficiency. \"The suggestion that nutritionists have been pointing out the mineral de- ficien(y in our diet is without foundation, and this claim is invariably made by food faddists and quacks whose prilue interest is in making money. The suggesting often made that vitamins require minerals for absorption and that minerals can enhance the effectiveness of vitamins is without foundation. \"The requirements for minerals are relatively specific and are important only in those areas where a true dietary mineral deficiency can be demonstrated. Xuch deficiencies as iodine deficiency in endemic goiter belts and iron de- ficiency among certain groups within our population are the only true danger areas.\" Kenneth B. Willson. president of the National Better Business Bureau (NBBB). says, \"Persons who suffer from arthritis and other ailments should not expect to obtain any relief through adding sea water to their diets.\" Further- more, the mineral constituents found in sea water are no different than mineral constituents present in ordinary foods. Willson also points out: Although advertising and labeling may refer to the \"44 chemicals present in sea water.\" labeling usually contains no information as to the amounts of the minerals purportedly present. The label of 1 product listed only 6 chemicals, although the advertising referred to 44 chemicals. According to some oceanographers, trace elements present in sea water, as well as the amounts of such elements, may vary from season to season and from one area to another. The amounts of calcium. phosphorus. iron, and iodine which would be obtained through taking even several tablespoons of sea water daily, as recommended by firms advertising sea water, would be infinitesimal. The only disease in man that is known to be associated with any deficiency of soil or water is simple goiter due to a lack of iodine in certain areas, and that deficiency may be remedied by the use of iodized salt. In a recent action against sea brine, the Food and Drug Administration moved to break up what Commaissioner George P. Larrick described as a \"nationwide sea water swindle.\" U.S. marshals in Texas, California, Indiana, Ohio, Penn- sylvania, and Michigan seized about 2,000 bottles of sea water packaged by a Florida laboratory. Larrick branded the advertising accompanying the sea water \"false and mis- leading.\" This literature asserts that sea brine is effective in the treatment of numerous diseases including arthritis and that it adds minerals to the diet that would otherwise be lacking. \"These allegations are false,\" declared the Commissioner. Sea water is not the only pseudopanacea offered to desperate sufferers of arthritis. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently ordered a halt to false advertising claims in connection with a book which had been a \"best seller\" for 42 weeks. The book originally sold for $2.50 a copy but as nationwide promotion increased its popularity, the price rose to $3.95. According to the NBBB, the basic theme of the book and its advertising is that arthritis and related conditions will be corrected and effectively relieved by a dietary regimen which includes cod-liver oil and orange juice and use of other foods and beverages prepared and eaten in certain recommended sequences. The author's theory is that \"water and oil don't go together\" and that if water 94703 0-63-pt. 1-794 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN is consumed with a meal and there is oil in the meal, \"it'll lead to arthritis.\" Carried a bit further, the book suggests that the use of milk or cream In coffee is a violation of the rule that oil and water do not go together. WIt is the thesis of the book's author, says the NBBB, \"that the most important control and management of arthritis consists of diet, water intake at controlled temperatures on an empty stomach, and the administration of cod-liver oil in controlled dosages for the purpose of supplying lubrication to the joints of the body.\" How many people would bite on this bait? The NBBB figures that more than half a million persons have purchased the book. Some of the advertising which the FTCl found objectionable included this statement: \"Read these findings by an authority. This expert has spent his entire lifetime specializing in research on just one disease-arthritis.\" The NBBB has this to say about the author of the book: He is president of the corporation that publishes, advertises, and distributes the book. The author and his wife own 50 percent of the corporate stock of the publishing company and, in addition, he receives an author's royalty amount- ing to 15 percent of the retail sales price of each book. The author identifies himself as a \"Ph. D.\" but the FTC found the doctorate was unearned: that it was bestowed by a college in England that the author had never visited; that he \"sent a check for $100 in appreciation thereof\" to the college prior to receiving the degree. A second honorary degree, \"doctor of arts and oratory,\" was awarded by an American college after the author had made a \"contribution\" of $1,000 to the college. Medical witnesses at the FTC hearing contended that. contrary to the theories contained in the book, cod-liver oil is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract as cod-liver oil; that mixing cod-liver oil with fresh orange juice to prevent the digestion of the cod-liver oil in the gastrointestinal tract is without founda- tion in fact; that such mixing does not enable the cod-liver oil to go directly to the joints. The medical witnesses also testified that taking cod-liver oil \"will not arrest the progress of. correct the underlying causes of. or cure arthritis, rheumatismli. or related conditions, nor would such a procedure afford relief fromn t he pain. stiffness. or other manifestations of any of the named diseases.\" Still another of the 1,200 types of treatment offered to arthritis victims with misleadingly implied benefits is \"immune milk.\" The milk allegedly gets its \"immunity\" to rheumatoid arthritis from antibodies produced in the udders of cows injected with streptococcus and staphylococcus vaccines. By drinking a quart of the milk each day, at $1.10 per quart, the victim of rheumatoid arthritis is supposed to acquire \"immunity\" or \"eure.\" And the milk must be eonsumed for a \"prolonged period to terminate the disease entirely.:' Dr. Lamont-Havers says there is \"no evidence that streptococci or any other living agent directly causes rheumatoid arthritis.\" and that treating patients by injecting such vaccinesd was tried and discarded by physicians more than 20 years ago. \"Even if these antibodies were beneficial to sufferers.\" lDr. Lnamont- Havers adds. \"careful studies have shown that antibodies in milk are infre- quently absorbed by humans.\" As for alfalfa, recently revived as a quack offering to arthritics, a report by Ruth Walrad, research consultant to the Committee on Arthritis Advertising of the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation. had this to say: \"Fine for livestock, the product is of no value to humans, arthritic or not. As with other worthless nostrums, the claims for alfalfa tablets, teas, and other brews are flagrantly extravagant since the product must be bought, not for its ingredients, but for its promises.\" One of the alfalfa tablets offered victims of arthritis. according to the report. contained one-half grain of dessicated alfalfa leaf and 3 grains of asprin. This type of treatment is but one of many in the category of 'glorified aspirin.\" prod- ucts that usually have aspirin as their only active ingredient although they are promoted as having benefits superior to those of aspirin. The price tag for some kinds of glorified aspirin may he 25 times that of the amount of ordinary aspirin needed to give an equal amount of temporary relief. For arthritis sufferers who like to take their treatment from a bottle, there is a wide range of \"medicines\"-none of which will provide any more of a cure than the glorified aspirin. Some of the useless nostrums are simply revivals of the patent medicines peddled by itinerant quacks a century ago. They containFRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 95 various assortments of herbs or fruit and vegetable juices suspended in water glycerine, or alcohol. One brand that has proved quite popular contains vitamin B1-plns more alcohol than you'll find in an equal amount of French brandy. Another bottled wonder is promoted with the suggestion that its contents will treat your arthritis and rheumatism by cleaning the \"poisons\" out of your blood. If the arthritis patient had any money left after treating himself on the alfalfa, alcohol, and glorified aspirin circuit, he could Invest in an array of Improbable gadgets that would arouse the envy of Rube Goldberg. One device confiscated by the Food and Drug Administration (FI)A) was a plastic lampshade and bulb. When a piece of blue plastic was placed over the lampshade opening, the pro- moters claimed, arthritis and rheumatism would be cured by bathing the affected limbs in the glow of the blue light. Another contraption (price $30) was supposed to produce an effect called a Z-ray. The Z-ray would restore the health of the arthritis victim by \"expanding the atoms\" in his body, according to its promoters. * Many treatments involve the supposed benefits of radioactivity or electronics. But the only knowvn benefits, investigators report, have accrued to the people who make money by exploiting arthritics with such useless devices. Thousands of hopeful arthritis patients have paid as much as $10 a visit to sit in old mine tunnels or ore-lined rooms which supposedly contained healthful radiations from uranium. Such treatments not only are a waste of time and money for arthritis victims, warns the FDA, but. \"any product emitting enough radio- activity to affect the functions of the body is dangerous to use without medical supervision.\" Patients who are taken in by such claims are not necessarily the unsophisti- cated country cousins, says the Arthritis and Rhemnnatism Foundation. It points out that plain copper bands, nothing more than can be purchased for a few cents in any novelty jewelry shop. are proimoted fer the treatuient of arthritis \"ironi- cally in the very shadow of that great depository of knowledge, the New York Public Library.\" Among the cruel results of the promotion of misrepresented products; says Dr. Lamont-Havers, are not only the false hopes raised in the minds of the Nation's arthritis victims, but public pressure to devote valuable research time to testing theories which show no promise of being effective. The cost of misrepresented products, a quarter of a billion dollars a year, is not the only slice taken out of our national wealth by this chronic crippler. The amount of job time lost by employed arthritics is the equivalent of 470,000 people thrown out of work each year. The annual loss in wages and taxes totals more than $2 billion. How can arthritis and rheumatism patients avoid wasting their money on worthless products or those whose claims are exaggerated? Here are a few suggestions: Consult your family doctor regularly. He has access to the latest knowledge about sound, scientific treatment of your ailment. Do not buy any product-drug or device-for treating your illness without consulting your family doctor about Its value. Be suspicious of any product that, promises more than temporary relief or claims to be a \"cure.\" Remember that the real cause and cure of arthritis are still unknown. Be aware that arthritis symptoms may come and go suddenly. If the symp- toms become less noticeable while you are using a particular product, the product may have had nothing to do with the remission. Learn more about arthritis and rheumatism. Have your doctor recommend sound educational material on the subject, or write to the Arthritis and Rheuma- tism Foundation, 10 Columbus Circle, New York 19, N.Y. Remember that time is very important in the treatment of arthritis. The ma- jority of patients today can avoid serious crippling if the symptoms are recog-. nized early and correct therapy is begun promptly. FACTS ABOUT ARTHRITIS Q. What is arthritis? A. The word \"arthritis\" literally means \"joint inflammation.\" The Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation lists more than 60 different rheumatic diseases- ailments marked by pain or swelling in the joints, muscles, or other tissues link- ing bones and muscles. Physicians prefer to include under the term \"arthritis\"'96 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN only diseases affecting the joints. The most common forms are rheumatoidarthritis and osteoarthritis, each of which afflicts more than 5 million people inthis country alone. Gout, one of the arthritic diseases, affects an additional half-million persons. Q. Is arthritis a disease of old people? A. Osteoarthritis affects almost everyone who lives long enough since it isrelated to the normal wear and tear on the joints over the years. Many peoplein their sixties have osteoarthritis but are unaware of the disease simply becauseit has not been painful so far. Rheumatoid arthritis strikes at any time frominfancy to old age. Most frequently, the victims of rheumatoid arthritis areyoung adults, between 20 and 45 years of age. Q. Does arthritis affect women more often than men? A. Yes and no. Ninety percent of gout victims are men. Rheumatoid arth-ritis, sometimes described as the most crippling form of rheumatic disease.strikes women three times as often as men. Some studies further indicate thatunmarried women are more susceptible than married women. Osteoarthritisafflicts to some degree 80 percent of women past 60. One form of arthritis, how-ever, seems to strike young male adults in particular. This disease, rheumatoidspondylitis, affects about 10 men for every woman victim.Drawings below show normal hip joint (left) and changes caused by the twomost common forms of arthritis. In osteoarthritis (center), cartilage cushionwears away and facing bone surfaces, once smooth, become rough. In rheuma-toid arthritis (right), soft tissues around joint are swollen and inflamed: inadvanced rheumatoid arthritis, soft tissues and bones may fuse to \"lock\" joint.

What causes arthritis? A. The exact cause is not known. One popular theory is that the ailment may be caused by an allergic reaction to an infection in some other part of the body. Some researchers think rheumatoid arthritis is caused by a virus,although the infecting organism has not been found. tMillions of dollars arespent each year in a search for the cause. One of the more promising studies shows that a substance known as the \"rheumatoid factor\" appears in the blood of people afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis but does not appear in the blood of normal persons.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 97 Fatigue, physical or mental, is known to be a factor that triggers the start of an arthritis attack. The disease frequently flares up in patients who have worked themselves to the point of exhaustion. Injury or infection also may start an attack of arthritis. Q. Is arthritis a fatal disease? A. Several of the less common forms of arthritis can be fatal. Systemic lupus erythematosus may cause death by involving the heart, lungs, and other vital organs. Most other forms of arthritis, although they may produce unbear- able pain, are not directly fatal. They-niay, however, shorten the life of a patient by hampering some of the normal body functions. Q. Can arthritis be cured? A. There is no specific cure for arthritis and only gout- and infectious arthritis are completely controllable at the present time. But the pain and swelling in most arthritis patients can be controlled -by sound medical treatment, and the joints and muscles can be rehabilitated by physical therapy. Q. Are special diets recommended for arthritis patients? A. There is nothing you can eat or not eat that will cause or cure arthritis. Extensive research has been conducted in the area of food and arthritis and the only conclusion reached is that the arthritis patient should have well-rounded, nourishing mneals-the same as normal persons. If overweight, the patient should shed the excess pounds simply to reduce the load on the inflamed joints. The majority of women with osteoarthritis are overweight, according to the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation. Q. Does exercise help? A. Yes, but tit should be under medical direction. The exercise should be directed toward maintaining or restoring the muscle loss that -is threatened by arthritis. And the exercise should be accompanied by adequate rest. The family physician should be consulted -about specific kinds of exercise that will help the individual patient without causing further damage to the joints involved. Q. Should an arthritic move to a warm climate? A.- People in all parts of the world suffer from arthritis. The disease was known among the ancient people of sunny Italy and Egypt. Some patients suffer more-on cold, damp days than on warm, dry days; some feel better. Other factors should be considered before making a move, however. One is the possible emotional problems of the arthritic who has been separated from old and close friends and relatives. Q. What are the warning signs of arthritis; A. Rheumatoid arthritis may begin with pain and swelling of the joints, persistent muscular aches and pains, unexplained weight loss, fever, and weak- ness. Osteoarthritis may start with noticeable pain and stiffness in the lower back, knees, and other joints, and tingling sensations in the fingertips. Don't attempt self-medication when such symptoms appear. Instead, consult your physician as. soon as possible. Early and. proper treatment of arthritis can prevent crippling in 70 percent of the persons affected. James Thacher from Massa'chusetts served as a surgeon's mate at Ticonderoga and in the Burgoyne campaign and was distinguished for his extensive military diary, during the war, and his historical writings afterward; he also wrote a dipensatory and a Modern Practice of Physic. Those medical aspects of the Revolution that he recorded are fascinating but scanty. But he did hand down a description of Captain Greg, who was scalped and survived, and of the wounds infested with maggots and how they were cleaned up with the tincture of myrrh, and other particulars.98 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN EXHIBrr 15 [By Dr. Paul Niehans] Help from Animal Cells? The way Dr. Paul Niehans, a stony- faced, ramrod-straight Swiss physician told it, his theory and practice of \"cellular therapy\" sounded plausible enough. Thir- ty years ago he had begun transplanting parts of animals (glands, and organs such as liver and kidneys) into human be- ings to correct dwarfism,- tetany,* and other disorders resulting from underactive glands. But in 1931 he was confronted with a woman dying of tetany and too weak for the operation. So Niehans in- jected a mass of cells from the parathy- roid gland of a freshly slaughtered calf. \"She is still alive today,\" Niehans last week told a twelve-nation conference of physicians at Karlsruhv. Germany. \"Since then I have made 5,000 injections. I have found a means to cure those armies of persons bodily and mentally depressed, suffering from defective functioning of organs.\" This brought orthodox, conservative doctors to the edge of their chairs and * Muscular spasms, often caused by defective parathyroid glands. TIME, SEPTEMBER 13, 1954started the hottest argument of a hot week in Karlsruhe. Niehans, whom some of his colleagues called arrogant and au- thoritarian, laid down strict rules for his method. The younger the animal from which glands or cells were taken, the bet- ter. This meant using calves, piglets, or other young animals still unborn-taken from dams slaughtered just before they were due to litter. (At one time his pa- tients had to go to slaughterhouses for treatment with fresh tissues, but a Heidel- berg chemical company has found a way to preserve the cells in powdered form so that they keep indefinitely.) Niehans in- sists that his treatment must not be tried in cases of infection or other acute ill- ness, and no other medication whatever must be giver, for several months after it. Several doctors who have adopted the Niehans technique, giving injections of embryonic animal cells at costs ranging from $3.50 to $20, supported his claims. But others shook their heads. There are great dangers: allergic reactions, shock, accidental infection with viruses or other microbes. There is a good chance that the \"placebo effect\" (i.e. mental suggestion) is responsible for improvement in many patients. Others, especially those suffering from a transient form of tetany, get better spontaneously. Niehans himself admitted:\"I can only report what I have seen. Exactly what happens inside the body and the various organs I do not know. But I hope to have the solution one day.\"FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 99 EXHIBrr 16 WVorlds Most J-\"tond soat Malta (i ?olS -0t m f, Itn tW pi.

Herr llolzapfel's wife, who once lived in Bayside, New York, and served as a nurse at the Lenox-Hill Hospital in Manhattan, answers: \"Those doctors in America! They say if it wasn't discovered by an Amer- ican it can't be much good. As a trained nurse I've seen many cases where cellu- lar therapy literally saved the lives of men and women.\" Dr. Nlehans' wife is a slender, charm- ing former Englishwoman. She was brought to Switzerland by her mother when she was 18. The Niehans have one child, a married daughter who lives in the city of Berne where Dr. Niehans was born and where his father wasprofessor of medicine at the University. \"In a way,\" Mrs. Niehans remarks gently, \"it is just as well that my husband doesn't have the medical fol- lowing in the States that he has here. Both of us love to travel and when we were In New York recently we stopped at the Waldorf-Astoria. No publicity, no interviews and no frantic phone calls from doctors who wanted to discuss some special case. It was a welcome respite.\" She, too, claims to have benefited greatly from her husband's therapy. The \"bible\" of the Niehans' method is a little book, celular Therapy, writ- ten by the doctor himself. \"Any American publisher,\" he says, \"has permission to bring out my book without payment of royalties to me. In that way perhaps some American doc- tors will get a better idea of cellular therapy than from some of the nonsense that has appeared in some of the more lurid newspapers.\" Briefly, the contents of the slim 120- page volume come to this: There are 40 trillion cells in our bodies and each cell is \"a carrier of life,\" a small-scale body H tt:1 Seventy-yearold Charlie Chaplin (shown here with his fourth wife, Oona O'Neill, and five of their six children) is often pointed out as a potent example of what Dr. Niehans' cellular treatment can do for the aging. 0-102 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN wtho is cashing in on on unproven therapy tatn dtats raIIt dat sa Wd Sp eat, On abe then hat a state htamen b Ztnt. ataaeln atd be atd bthr att ilt atlia a Skat tier ..attn aZ ,,.e wnedri sret .supmet dae o ate.

Oc- Lasuonally the editors of certain magazines publi- cize an unestablished remedy. which brings it to the attention of the public as a medical discovery of alleged value in one or more disease categories. Such an item has appeared in Coronet, a popular pocket-sized magazine; it covered the methods and claims of Dr. Paul Niehans, a Swiss physician. The vdlitors noted that -Cellular therapy is a startling European treatment for old age and a wide variety of diseases. Because this medical technique is con- troversial and still unproven, Coronet asked Dr. Herbert S. Benjamin, an American physician and medical researcher, to discuss it with its discoverer. Dr. Paul Niehans of Switzerland. and to observe his work and evaluate the use of cellular therapy by many physicians in Western Europe ...' Dr. Paul Niehans has had the benefit of other items of publicity written on his behalf. The great- est flurry of such press-agentry occurred when he was called to treat the late Pope Pius XII in Feb- ruary. 1954. Among others who are alleged to have received his attention are Konrad Adenauer and W. Somerset Maugham. The late Pope was suffering from a gastric dis- order, the exact nature of which was never clearly described but which apparently involved a dis- tressing bout with hiccoughs. The late Holy Father had at least one other physician in attendance, one Professor Caleazzi-Lisi. who later became involved with the Italian medical fraternity by selling photo- graphs and an account of the late Pope's dying hours. There is no clear indication, either, in all of the publicity which attended the nonfatal papal illness, whether or not fresh cell therapy, or royal jelly (another publicized rejuvenator), or the passage of time was responsible for his recovery. The Chi- caigo Tribune, however, on June 3, 19517 in an Associated Press release bearing a Rome date line, reported that Dr. Niehans had written a book en- titled \"Nichans, Doctor of the Pope.' Niehans was described in that news dispatch as having credited potato soup with being the effective therapeutic agent. Beyond other newspaper publicity, Dr. Niehans has had the benefit of several magazine articles. A magazine called Top Secret, which was not dated, hut was purchased in August, 1954, had an item entitled \"Modern Miracle in the Vatican: Tbe Con- troversial Doctor Who Saved the Pope's Lifel' Forsome reason, however, this item did not reveal the use of potato soup. This account-of the treatment was as follows: In February 1954, the world was confronted with a mir- acle in the great tradition of the Church. But it was a modemn miracle in which twentieth century science coopc,- ated with religion.

Dr. Niehans is a controvessial figure in the world of in- ternational medicine.

This usnortho- don method consists in the transplantation of living cells from a freshly slaughtered animal. And in coniunction with this, a new miracle drug called 'sylocaina.\" used to alleviate pain resulting from abdominal surgery, was given to the Pope. This drug was developed by Dr. Niehans in his own laboratories in Switzerland....- The Dec. 10, 1957, issue of Look magazine car- ried an item entitled \"Is This Man Keeping the Pope Aliver Reference was made to the use of cell therapy. Mention of Dr. Niehans has also been made in Time. The Sept. 13, 1954. issue, in an item entitled Help From Animal Cells?\" referred to the use of glands and organs of animals being utilized by Dr. Nielsans as long ago as 1931 and reported his read- ing of a paper before some physicians in Karlsruhe, Cermany. This item included the following state- ment. Several doctors who have adopted the Niehans technique. giving injections of embryonic amimal cells at costs ranging from $3.50 to $20, supported his caims. But others shook their heads.

Another issue of the same publication (Time, Aug. 31, 1959) contained an item concerning Dr. Niehans, entitled 'The Healing Lamb.\" The 1954 publicity prompted an inquiry from the Department of Investigation to the Swiss Medical Institutions at Bern. Following is the response re- ceived from the secretary: Dr. Paul Niehans, domidliated at ClaQens uses to make iniecsions of fresh organ's pap, to what he aftaihutes an effect on the corresponding organ.

In Switzerland, Dr. Nlehans did not succeed in gaining a great number of adepts, but it .senos that this is more the case abroad. Of interest, also, are the items critical of Niehans and his method. Tne JouaNAL, ( 156:1348 [Dec. 4] 1954) under the heading Foreign Letters, carried an account of some untoward effects, including bru- cellssis and encephalomyelitis, developing in some patients treated with \"fresh cells.' This was de- scribed as having been reported by Professor Benn- hold of the University of Tuebingen Medical School. The European medical literature contains several references to the tuse of fresh cell therapy. One of these, entitled \"Historical Development of Fresh Cell Therapy and its Application in General Prac- tice\", wats published in the Miinchen. med. Wchnschlr. for May 27. 1955 (Vol. 97, pp. 698-703). This discussed methods of administration, and sug- gested that the patient should be sleeping and should not awaken for at least 24 hours. Another report, entitled \"Fresh Cell Therapy: Critical Evaluation of Theory and the Nature of the Fresh Cell Therapy According to Niehans\", by A. Pischinger, Pischinger criticizes the Ab- derhalden serum test, which apparently is used by Niehans for diagnostic purposes. In addition to recalling harmful effects from the injection of fresh cells, including infections, it is stated that death has been traced to the treatment. This author ques- tions the Niehans claim that fresh cell therapy is organ-specific, recounting his experience with ani- mal experimentation, that no matter what organ source wvas injected, the biological effect was the same immediately after the injection. Another critical report, entitled 'Possibilities and Limitations of Cell Therapy,\" was published in the .Mrinchlener mediziniscle Wochenschrift (97:703-707 [May 27] 1959). The author, H. C. Rietschel, out- lines three phases involved in cell therapy, the first being described as a hormone effect, the second as the stress stage (between the 11th and 14th day), and the last, one of regeneration. He points out that tde likelihood is that cell therapy acts on the general cell metabolism but that specific effects, in the sense of a regenerative stimulation of a cer- tain organ, have not been observed clinically. There is reference to a patent granted in Switzer' land in October, 1952, to Leo Schwander and Paul Niehans. This is a process of preservation of organ- cell preparations by freezing and sublimation. There is also a firm called Rhein-Chemle, Abteilung Dr. Niehans, In Heidelberg. In a promotional booklet called \"Dr. Niehans Zellular-Theraple, Siccazell.\", which, among other things, warns that ccllu- lar therapy is not a panacea and is contraindicated in all inflammatory diseases and in focal toxicoses, It is stated that there are certain diseases wherein the method is not successful. These include \"amyo- trophic lateral sclerosis, chondrodystrophy, all forms of leukemia.' The product is recommended in heart diseases, circulatory disturbances, arteriosclerotic changes and hypertension, climacteric, sterility, impotence, arthritis and rheumatism, mongolism, and prostatic diseases (including adenoma of the prostate). In the circumstances, such claims cannot be regarded as established. An attitude of scientific \"Missourian- ism\" will undoubtedly prevail in this country. From European discussions and observations it is fair to say that the most favorable impression of the cell therapy is that it is experimental at best and does not provide, in the hands of others, what the originator claims for it. To an observer of some skepticism, however, this method of promotion brings a typical reaction, i. e., having failed to im- press critical medical observers, the possessors of the particular treatment resort to the familiar meth- ods designed to create a demand for a medical commodity. On the other hand, THE JOUs sAL (165:2133 [Dec. 21] 1957) carried an abstract of a report by G. Destunis entitled \"The Treatment of Mental Defi- ciency and Encephalopathies in Childhood by Means of Fresh Tissue and Siccacell.' This was from the Archives of Pediatrics and reported in part: In diencephalon implantations, a section of calf brain comprising the whole diencephalon and weighing approsi- mately 20 Cm. is comminuted, and stirred into a mash to which is added 100,000 to 200,000 units of penicillin, and injected under pressure through a wide-bore cannula into the gluteal region of the patient.... Revitalization follows diencephalon implantation. The children are more alert, fresh, and balanced; they have better appetites and a more restful sleep. They take a more active part in the daily life of the family and show more interest in their schoolwork. Their intelligence, memory, and capacity for giving attention are advanced by some 6 to 12 months. Beyond the latest item of Niehans' publicity in Coronet for December, 1959, written by Herbert S. Benjamin, M.D., there was an item in a.gossip column in the Chicago American for Nov. 24, 1959, as follows: CuGies Lambert, author of 'The Conquest of Age,' isbeingept undler wraps by his publishers because so many peipstrytog to get to him.

Because the American public is somewhat familiar with a smorg- asbord type of meal, I used that analogy as a graphic way toillustrate the fact that the liver, thyroid, pancreas, stomach, bone marrow, gonads, adrenals, pitui- tary and all the other little chem- ical \"factories\" within the body might thus figuratively march around the smorgasbord and help themselves to the calcium, molyb- denum, magnesium, iron, copper and all the other 44 water-soluble chemicals which we may require for robust health. In 1960, 1 ran several additional articles in my newspaper column, of which the following are typical: WORRY CLINIC By George W. Crane, M.D.,Ph.D. Grandpa Miller's rejuvenation has been steady. In four months on sea brine therapy, he got out of an Invalid's chair and be- gan hobbling around with his aluminum walker. But the im- provement in his arthritic hip was what surprised me most. Maybe ocean water is the real \"Fountain of Youth,\" for it con- tains ALL the water soluble chemicals on this earth. Case E-63: Eli Miller, aged 97, is Mrs. Crane's father, and has been taking one teaspoonful of concentrated sea water every day. After having been a chair Pat- ient for almost a year, during which time we had to lilt him in and out of bed and often feed him by hand, he began to perk up. After he had spent four months on the sea brine treatment. I was mowing the lawn at his house late one afternoon. AS I PASSED the kitchen win- dows, I saw Grandpa Miler hobbling around with his alum- inum walker. He went over to the kitchen stove and turned on the electric burner to heat water for coffee. The window was open, so I heard him grumbling in Irritable tones: \"Where's Cora? Does she think I'm gonna starve to death up here by myself?\" Whereupon, I called through the open window and told him to go to the table and I'd come in and prepare his supper. PLEASE REMEMBER that he had been a bedfast or chair-fast patient and was heading into his 97th birthday. If any changes were to occur.it would be natural to expect Grandpa to continue growing MORE feeble and MORE senile, wouldn't it? But he began to perk up, both mentally and physically. He now would get up unaided in the morn- ing and put on his clothes. Then he'd walk to the bathroom and wash, after which he'd come to the table. THE FOLLOWING night, Mrs. Crane motioned for me to come to his bedroom door and peek in. What I saw was the greatest miracle as regards his rejuvena- tion. For he had had an arthritic right hip far over ten years. When we'd dress him, he'd yell if we moved his right leg even gently. In fact, if his dog would accidently bump that right leg Grandpa would yell so you could hear him a block away. BUT NOW he lifted the arthritic right leg, crossed the right ankle over his left knee, and removed his shoe and sock; then let the right foot drop back upon the floor without letting oat a peep.And if you have been around him for the past 20 years. as Mrs. Crane and I have, you'd realize that some miracle must have happened to his arthritic right hip! That was when I began to check back to see how we might explain his rejuvenation. And the ONLY new items in his food or drink has been the daily teaspoon of sea water (concen- trated ten times the usual ocean strength). IF OUR HUMAN body needs a wide variety of chemicals to keep our various organs and glands UP to par, we know that ALL water soluble chemicals are in the oceans. But some 20 are now denuded or leeched from our soil by fre- quent plowing and rainfall, so our foodstuff is chemically deficient. Remember, only a trace of iodine added in 1924 to table salt has eliminated almost all goiters. And a trace of fluoride in drink- ing water is cutting down dental decay about 65 per cent. Will a trace of other vital chem. ,cals insure us against cancer or diabetes or even gray hair and baldness? Modern medicine regards this idea as probably the most signi-ficant Innovation since the sua drugs and antibiotics. (Always write to Dr. Crane in care of The Anderson (S. C.)

The ln-a ot The Am.tD Midkol A.-Wi COUNCIL ON FOODS AND NUTRITION VITAMIN PREPARATIONS AS DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS AND AS THERAPEUTIC AGENTS The Council has authorized publication of the following statement. PHILIP L. WHrrE, Sc.D., Secretary. Vitamin preparations are used extensively and are valuable when used properly. For the most in- telligent use and beneficial results in preventive or therapeutic medicine, the values and the limitations of vitamins should be realized. It is important that a clear differentiation be made between vitamins as dietary supplements and vitamins as therapeutic agents. The Council on Foods and Nutrition has reviewed the indications for administration of vita- mins in supplemental and therapeutic amounts, the composition and dosage of vitamin preparations, and the possible dangers of excessive use of certain vitamins. The following is the Councils present position on this matter. Recommended Dietary Allowances of Vitamins and Their Occurrence in Food Vitamins are essential nutrients, and their usual source is food. All the nutrients essential to the maintenance of health in the normal individual are supplied by an adequate diet, one which fulfills the Recommended Dietary Allowances, revised 1958, developed by the Food and Nutrition Board, Na- tional Research Council (Publication 589). The levels of nutrients recommended are desirable goals in nutrition for all normal, healthy persons. They are believed to be adequate for maintaining good nutri- tion throughout life. Normal Diets.-A convenient guide to the compo- sition of an adequate diet has been prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture (Leaflet 424). Foods are classified according to their contri- bution of several nutrients, although emphasis is placed on key foods as important sources of certain nutrients. This daily food plan gives a basis for an adequate diet but permits the individual wide choice in his food selections. This is the fundamen- tal plan: Milk Croup: Some milk daily- Children ................... 3 to 4 cups Teen-ageis ................... 4 or more mups Adults ................... 2 or more cops Pregnant women ................... 4 or more raps Nursing mothers . ^ 6or more raps Cheese and ire cream rua replace pans of the milk. Meat Croup: TsO or more serngs, including-Beef, -eal, pork, lamab, poultry, fish, eggs, weith day beams and peas and nuts as alternate.Vegetable-Fruit Cmoup: Four or more servings, including- A dark green or deep yellow segetable important for vitamin A-at least every other day. A citrus fruit or other fruit or vegetable important for vitamin C-daily. Other fruits and egetables including potatoes. Bread-Cereals Croup: Four or more servings-Whole grain, enriched, restored. This fundamental plan will supply the adult with one-half to twvo-thirds of the caloric allowance, four-fifths of the iron, four-fifths of the thiamine, nine-tenths of the niacin, and all of the riboflavin allowances. These nutrients and others not men- tioned will be raised to adequate amounts by the oth6. foods nrinmally included in the daily diet tut not specifically mentioned in the basic plan. Foods such as butter, margarine, other fats and oils, sug- ars, desserts, jellies, and unenriched grain products serve to fulfill the caloric and nutrient allowances. T.seLE 1.-Minimum Daily Requirements Compared ith Dietary t.5.t.b Vitamin C ....... .......... 3 0 7 W 2 7 Vitamot utuind. Therefore, if the diet contains the key food groups in sufficient amounts, nutritional supplementation should be unnecessary. The proper selection and preparation of foods are important to the achieve- ment of an adequate diet. Minimum Daily Requirertents.-The Recorn- mended Dietary Allowances should not be con- fused with the Minimum Daily Requirements established for labeling purposes by the Food and Drug Administration. Nutrient contents can thus be expressed in terms of the proportion of daily requirements supplied. Minimum Daily Require- ments are the amounts of nutrients needed to pre- vent symptoms of deficiency and to provide a small factor of safety. Recommended Dietary Allowances are amounts of nutrients which will maintain good nutrition in essentially all healthy persons. Table 1 3/62:32114 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN demonstrates the basic differences between the two concepts. Throughout this statement the Recom- mended Dietary Allowances will be used. Vitamins as Dietary Supplements Healthy persons whose diets are ordinarily con- sidered adequate may benefit from supplementary vitamins at certain special periods of life, such as during pregnancy and lactation. Vitamin supple- mentation is useful during periods of illness or deranged mode of life, which may result in impair- ment of absorption of nutrients or deterioration of dietary quality. Supplementation may also be of value to the individual who, through ignorance, poor eating habits, or emotional or physical illness, does not eat an adequate diet. The physician's pri- mary responsibility for these patients is to remove these disturbing factors rather than merely to allevi- ate their results. Nevertheless, until the disturbing factors have been discovered and, when possible, removed, supplementary vitamins are valuable in assuring adequate intake. Infants and Children.-The daily diet of the arti- ficially fed infant should, be supplemented. with vitamins C and D if the diet does not supply 30 mg. of vitamin C and 400 U. S. P. units of vitamin D. The diet should be brought up to these amounts, with care exercised that the intake of vitamin D is not excessive. The requirement of the breast-fed baby for vitamin D is not accurately known, but it is accepted practice to advdcate 400 U. S. P. units of vitamin D supplement d'ily. Administration of vitamin D and, in artifinllyvfed babies, of vitamin C should be started with the introduction of arti- ficial feeding. Too often administration of vitamin C is delayed even into the second month. When administration of the vitamins is started, the amount of vitamin D is often too great and the amount of vitamin C too small. Maximum calcium and phosphorus retentions are obtained with 300 to 400 U. S. P. units of vitamin D daily. Not only are reteritions no greater with larger amounts, but the use of 1,800 U. S. P. units or more daily for several months decreases appetite and, as a consequence, reduces the total retentions of calcium and phos- phorus and slows linear growth. Infants receiving unfortified skimmed milk formulas also require supplements of vitamin A (1,.500 U. S. P. units daily). Healthy children fed adequate amounts of whole- some foods need no supplemental vitamins except vitamin D, which should be supplied throughout the growth period. An adequate intake of vitamin D-fortified homogenized milk or reconstituted evap- orated milk (1\u00bd to 2 pt. daily) provides the vitamin D required. The physician should determine the approximate amount of vitamin D supplied by foods before supplementing the diets. In certain instances, physicians may wish to supplement the diets of infants and children with preparations con- taining vitamins A, C, D, and certain B vitamins.The Council believes that such preparations con- taining the B complex are not needed for routine use but would be of value for children with special problems. It is important that the growing child be introduced to a wide variety of wholesome foods, since food is the normal source of nutrients. Adults.-Healthy adults receiving adequate diets have no need for supplementary vitamins except during pregnancy and lactation when 400 U. S. P. units of vitamin D daily are required if the intake of vitamin D-fortified milk is low. In these periods of physiological stress, if any doubt exists as to the adequacy of the previous or present diet, supple- mentary vitamins in addition to vitamin D should be administered. Supplementary vitamins are useful during periods of emotional, illness, which result in bizarre food habits or greatly diminished food intake. The choice of vitamin preparations to be used to insure a de- sirable nutrient intake in such instances should be based upon the physician's evaluation of the pa- tient's dietary pattern. When restricted or nutritionally inadequate diets are prescribed for pathological conditions, vitamin mixtures as supportive supplements are indicated. Examples of conditions in which such diets may be instituted include allergic states and chronic dis- eases of the gastrointestinal tract. Vitamin supple- mentation also is indicated when it is necessary to employ parenteral feeding. The character of the supplementation required will depend on the diet, the nutrients administered, and the period of time the regimen is maintained. In any prolonged illness associated with decreased food intake or in other situations in which an in- dividual is * nable or unwilling to eat an adequate diet, the physician must decide whether supple- mentation is necessary. The extent of the illness or the nature of the dietary restriction should be evaluated to determine whether the level of vitamin supplementation should be equal to allowances under normal physiological conditions or in excess of them. Nutrition surveys in several areas of the United States have indicated that a variable fraction of certain segments of the population is not receiving sufficient varieties of foods to supply vitamins in amounts necessary to meet the Recommended Die- tary Allowances. Generalization of these findings as a basis for vitamin supplementation of healthy individuals is not rational. The methodology em- ployed in these surveys and the standards used for interpretation have varied considerably. It is neces- sary for the physician to evaluate each person individually. Correction of inadequacies should then be instituted, preferably by a proper diet, although supplementation with vitamins may be necessary until dietary adjustments are made and the body stores repleted. Avoidance of excessive or unneces- sary supplementation is, of course, desirable.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 115 Multivitamin Combinations Multiple vitamin preparations should contain only those vitamins shown to be essential in human nutrition or metabolism. The Council recognizes that certain foods such as liver, yeast, and wheat germ are excellent sources of some of the vitamins but finds no evidence to justify special claims for such materials or their concentrates in multivitamin mixtures. The combination of vitamins in a supple- mentary mixture should have a rational basis. Several combinations meet these criteria.1. A combination of all the vitamins that have been demonstrated to be essential in human metab- olism may be desirable for supplementation of cer- tain restricted diets. Such preparations would in- Cude vitamins A and D. ascorbic acid, thiamine,listed undes (a) in combination with ascorbic acid, or (c) a combination of a calcium salt and vitamin D in a stable form. 3. A combination of vitamins that might be expected to be lacking concomitantly because of their common distribution in foods also might be desirable for supplementation. Examples would in- Cude the fat-soluble vitamins A and D or vitamins of the B complex as previously noted. Quantities for Dietary Supplementation-The quantities of vitamins included in mixtures for die- tary supplementation should furnish daily an amount which approximately fulfills, but does not greatly exceed, the Recommended Dietary Allow- ances for vitamins as given in table 2. The physician should exercise more caution that his recommenda- TASD.L Cnidu. G04. 70 0.1 75 0.4 70 0.O ASS OA 44 0.0 04 .0 o 10 1.5 S0 1.0 OD 14.4 SO I. 75 Add. U00U Mr. (I b d . Mes. Mg.

Vitamin D would be included in preparations for children, adolescents, and pregnant or nursing women and would be optional in others. 2. A combination of vitamins having comple- mentary metabolic functions should prove useful in supplementation of certain restricted diets. These preparations might include (a) a com- bination of the B vitamins, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin, with or without pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, folic acid, or vitamin B.,; (b) the B vitaminstions are not increased in amount and that his patients do not follow the precept that greater con- centrations of vitamins are justified, in light of the little additional cost. There is a tendency for the patient to believe that, if a little is good, more would be better. It has not been demonstrated that larger amounts are beneficial under ordinary physi- ological conditions; in fact, an overdosage of vita- mins A or D can be harmful The multivitamin preparations available today fall into three general categories, those that supply (1) about one-half the Recommended Dietary Al- lowances, (2) one to one and one-half times the Recommended Dietary Allowances, and (3) three to five times the Recommended Dietary Allowances. The Council considers the first class of preparations useful in dietary supplementation in situations as116 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN noted in the section entitled Vitamins as Dietary Supplements. The preparations containing one to one and one-half times the Recommended Dietary Allowances (group 2) would be useful when supple- menting therapeutic diets or when prolonged illness or other causes significantly reduce food intake. After the normal diet is instituted, these higher potency preparations are not needed. The third general type of preparations containing three to five times the Recommended Dietary Allowances should be reserved for use in therapy as discussed in the section on Vitamins as Therapeutic Agents. Recommended Dietary Allowances have not been established for pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, folic acid, or vitamin B,,, although all these substances are essential in human metabolism. The amounts present in diets considered adequate in other factory should serve as a guide for quantities to be used in supplementation. The amount of folic acid in supplementary vitamin mixtures should be no greater than that available from an abundant die- tary. Common experience indicates that this is a quantity which will seldom support hematological function in pernicious anemia and therefore will not mask the diagnosis of this disorder. Although this quantity is still to be determined, 0.3 mg. of folic acid is suggested tentatively as a proper maxi- mum amount for supplemental mixtures. An abundant dietary provides 2 to 10 mcg. of vitamin B,5, 5 to 10 mg. of pantothenic acid, and 1 to 3 mg. of pyridoxine. Therefore, these levels are considered satisfactory in vitamin mixtures for dietary supplementation. Supplementary vitamins administered in the amounts suggested are safe. If the amount of one or more of the vitamins in these mixtures is markedly less than the recommended allowance, the supplemental value of the prepara- tion may be limited accordingly. Combination of Vitamins and Minerals.-Minerals have been combined with vitamins in mixtures for dietary supplementation. Although certain supple- mental vitamin mixtures with calcium, iron, or with both minerals have proved useful, there is no good evidence to support the inclusion of the 12 or more mineral elements essential for man. Few of these minerals are likely to be lacking, even in restricted diets. When iron is needed as a dietary supplement, it should be given as such in most instances. Iron and calcium might be included as optional ingredi- ents in certain supplemental vitamin mixtures, for example, for administration during pregnancy. A combination of calcium and vitamin D in stabilized form may be useful. Sodium, chlorine, and iodine are usually supplied by iodized table salt. Supple- mentation with copper is rarely needed since it is usually adequately supplied by the diet. Evidence is lacking that addition of the trace elements, such as manganese, zinc, cobalt, and molybdenum, to the human diet is needed.Vitamins as Therapeutic Agents Vitamins in therapeutic amounts have proved valuable in both specific therapy and in supportive therapy in numerous pathological states. Vitamins in therapeutic amounts are indicated only in the treatment of deficiency states or pathological con- ditions in which requirements are increased. Therapeutic vitamin mixtures should be so labeled and should not be used as dietary supple- ments. The decision to employ vitamin preparations in therapeutic amounts clearly rests with the physi- cian, and the importance of medical supervision when such amounts are administered is emphasized. The quantities of vitamins included in mixtures intended for therapeutic use in the treatment of multiple vitamin deficiencies should approximate simple multiples of the amounts recommended in the National Research Council's Recommended Dietary Allowances, revised 1958. It is seldom nec- essary to administer vitamins in amounts greater than three to five times the Recommended Dietary Allowances. In the rare instances in which larger quantities seem indicated, the vitamin(s) in ques- tion should be given separately. Although there is little danger of harm from larger quantities of the water-soluble vitamins because the excess is ex- creted readily, there is real danger of toxicity from larger amounts of fat-soluble vitamins because the excess accumulates in the body. In multivitamin preparations, the amount of vitamin D should not exceed three times the Recommended Dietary Al- lowances as previously stated. The combination of vitamins in mixtures intended for therapy should have a rational basis. Suitable combinations include (1) vitamins that have com- plementary metabolic functions and (2) vitamins that might be expected to be lacking concomitantly according to their common distribution in foods, or to similar chemical properties which influence absorption and biological availability. Examples would include (1) a combination of the B vitamins, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin, with or without pyridoxine and calcium pantothenate; (2) a com- bination of these B vitamins- with ascorbic acid; and (3) a combination of fat-soluble vitamins A and D or A, D, and K. In addition, a combination of vitamins A, D, ascorbic acid, thiamine, ribo- flavin, and niacin, with or without pyridoxine or calcium pantothenate, may be desirable. There is little evidence which warrants inclusion of folic acid and vitamin B,2in therapeutic amounts in vitamin mixtures. As noted previously, folic acid in therapeutic dosage may mask the diagnosis of pernicious anemia and permit- neurological lesions to develop while maintaining hematological remis- sion. When folic acid is indicated in therapeutic quantities, it should be administered'-separately. The need for inclusion of vitamin B,2in therapeutic vitamin mixtures in an amount in excess of that supplied by an abundant dietary has not been demonstrated to date.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 117 Before vitamins or other therapeutic agents are prescribed in the treatment of anemia, the etiology of the anemia should be determined. This will per- mit administration of the proper hematinic agent, which will usually be a single factor, namely, vita- min Bs, folic acid, or iron. Preparations containing all or most of the known antianemic factors, vita- min B,,, intrinsic factor, folic acid, iron, ascorbic acid, and copper, are, in the opinion of the Council, not justifiable. Toxicity of Vitamins A and D Inclusion of excessive amounts of fat-soluble vita- mins in therapeutic mixtures is scientifically un- warranted and potentially dangerous. The absence of excretory pathways for vitamins A and D and for carotene makes it necessary to limit their intake in order to avoid the development of hypervita- minosis. Daily dosage of more than 25,000 U. S. P. units of vitamin A should be followed carefully for toxicity. Hypervitaminosis A.-Apparently the body can tolerate quantites of vitamin A 100 times greater than the daily physiological requirement, but there is a definite possibility of harm from the prolonged ingestion of vitamin A in excess of 50,000 U. S. P. units daily. Chronic vitamin A intoxication occurs more frequently in children than in adults. De- pending upon the severity of the intoxication, chil- dren older than one year may develop anorexia, weight loss, irritability, of the mouth, and cracking and bleeding of the lips. tater signs include hepatomegaly. hydrocephaly; alopecia, painful swellings over the long bones with bone and joint pains and bone tenderness, hyperostosis, deep, hard, tender swell- ings in the extresiuties, and cortical thickening in tubular bones. Serum vitamin A levels are increased and are useful diagnostically. Vitamin A intoxica- tion in adults causes symptoms which are similar to those of hypervitaminosis A in children but are usually milder. Structural bone changes are notlikely to occur, and bone and joint pains are not so severe. Menstrual alterations, exophthalmos, and pigmentation of the skin have been reported. Tran- sitory increased intracinnial pressure has been noted in severe acute toxicity. Hypervitaminosis D.-There is great variation in individual tolerance to large amounts of vitamin D. Several factors influence response to continued in- gestion of large amounts of vitamin D, including exposure to ultraviolet light, dietary calcium, and the endocrine system. A daily intake of 1,800 U. S. P. units continued over long periods of time may be mildly toxic in children. However, in the uncommon syndrome, refractory rickets, as much as 50,000 to over 100,000 U. S. P. units daily may be tolerated or, indeed, required. The early symptoms of vitamin D intoxication include anorexia, nausea, headache, polyuria and nocturia, and diarrhea. Pallor and lassitude are also common findings in children. Later symptoms and signs include weakness, fatigue, renal damage, metastatic calcification, and depression. Hypochro- mic, normocytic anemia with azotemia has been reported in adults with hypervitaminosis D. When large dosages of vitamin D are administered, fre- quent determinations of serum and urine calcium should be made. An increase in the serim calcium to a level above 11 mg. per 100 ml., occurring in association with a high intake of vitamin D, is an indication for interdiction of the vitamin D supple- ment. Comment Vitamin mixtures, other than those discussed herein, may be demonstrated to be ueful in therapy by further research. Until adequate scientific evi- dence is presented as to their value, however, such mixtures should not be advocated for general use. Public health will be served best by insistence on a factual basis for vitamin supplementation and therapy. It is sound judgment to emphasize re- peatedly that properly selected diets are the pri- mary basis for good nutrition.118 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN The CHAIRMAN. Now the hearing will stand adjourned until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, at which time Senator Williams will take over the chair. Thank you. At this point I will enclose letters and statements received from various individuals. (The letter and statements follow:) PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. EMMETT J. MURPHY, DIRECTOR OF INDUSTPIAL RELATIONS, NATIONAL CHIROPRACTIC ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, I).C. Mr. Chairman, my name is Dr. Emmett J. Murphy. I am director of industrial relations for the National Chiropractic Association. Washington. D.C. The National Chiropractic Association commends this committee on its fore- sight and diligence in calling these hearings. Our organization has consistently supported its purposes. We share with you a deep concern that many old people, and many others among our citizens are harassed and injured by charlatans and purveyors of fake nostrums, gadgets, and useless or harmful drugs.Bringing these conditions to the attention of the public can serve a most worthy purpose and accomplish great good. For eternal vigilance is the price all must pay to be free from the imposition of false claims and false claimers. We in the National Chiropractic Association represent the second largest healing profession in the United States. We have established a professional code of ethics to which all our members must comply, and which is enforced by the licensing boards in the several States. As the official organization of the main body of properly trained and duly licensed doctors of chiropractic, we have a dedicated membership singularly devoted to serving the needs of the public. I wish to state here that the National Chiropractic Association has tried to cooperate with the Food and Drug Administration in its programs. We have sought to gain information from FDA officials so that the members of our pry fession may be alerted to the very dangers which you are exposing in your inquiry in this committee. We trust that the authority of this ageney will be broadened to give the officials of the Food and Drug Administration the policing powers which may be needed to give protection to the public. The committees of Congress likewise know of our strong position for an entirely professional approach to the problems of health and safety which properly concern our branch of the healing arts. We look forward to con- tinued association with your committee in its constructive work. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity to present the views of the National Chiropractic Association on this important subject. NEW YORK, N.Y., January 23, 1963. Hon. PAT MCNAMARA, U.S. Senator, Senate Offlce Buildinq, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR MCNAMARA: On or about January 14 last. my work. recently published book and my name were linked in an unfavorable connection before your committee. According to published reports, a number of books were cited and my own book was dumped in amongst them. making me appear guilty by association. Mine is not a book of the type that the Government would be against. The speaker that day, however. completely dislikes its contents, which need not surprise anyone. A copy of that book is enclosed. You will greatly honor me by reading it from cover to cover. The enclosed newspaper clippings are examples of the publicity that smear called forth. Dear Senator, In my youth, I was instrumental in having the immigration laws changed so that, following that change, would-be immigrants were ex- amined for fitness to enter abroad, instead of taking the risk of coming here and be turned back to his country of origin without a home or means. That is still the law today. Furthermore, .I am the \"father\" of the school lunch system weFRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 119 now have in all our schools of the greater city, which was adopted in manyother cities and gave us a national school lunch system. Moreover, for the past48 years I have been devoting much time in creating a library which has beenacclaimed throughout the civilized world. When the late President Franklin D.Roosevelt planned to establish at Hyde Park, N.Y. a research center for thestudy of international relations, he came to me for cooperation. I was happyto participate, since my own library deals with that very subject. Finally, the New York State Board of Regents recently awarded me a charter for that library. Those are samples of my activities in the past. Now, in the twilight of my life, I felt strongly impelled to write a book and to \"cry out\" against one medical injustice, the poor care we give to our sufferersfrom arthritis and rheumatism. Those who attacked me before your committeeare against what I am trying to accomplish. In my humble opinion, they are mistaken in their opposition to my efforts, as I hope you will perceive inreading my book. Not wishing to burden with a longer letter, I desire to appeal to you mostrespectfully to grant me the opportunity to make a reply before your committee. The attempted smear is the usual method employed by the big pharmaceutical houses and the doctors who work with them, to hinder and obstruct anyone who is doing something which they do not like or approve. That smear shouldnot be permitted to stand unanswered. Thanking you in advance for your courtesies, Respectfully yours, JOSEPH BROADMAN., M.D. MILES LABORATORIES, INC.Elkhart, Ind., January 25, 1963. Hon. HARsIsoON A. WILLIAM1S, Jr., Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. SIR: I have written the chairman of your committee, Senator McNamara, an extensive note which I hope may appear in the record of your committee com-menting on the rather distorted and certainly disturbing press statements which have been appearing about testimony before your committee on the subject ofvitamin nutrition. I have written him another letter today, which may notarrive in time to appear in the record and which I think well states a centralpart of this issue. I have taken the liberty of enclosing a carbon of this letterto your attention. The more extensive comments of my letter of yesterday will, I think, answer or at least offer significant and logical questions to sonme of therepresentations made before your committee and which raised personal questions in your mind, as evidenced by your statement of January 15 in the committee hearings. I believe that a great disservice is being done the American public in thepublicity arising out of this testimony since large n'umbers of them, as were you, will be persuaded that there is no need for vitamin supplementation ofthe average diet. Rephrasing Dr. Shank's statement. I would put it rather this way: The im- mediate question really is not whether an individual can, by the exercise ofperfect restraint, complete knowledge, and consistent availability of the proper foods,. select a diet which is not lacking in one of these essential substances. The question is whether he does, or vastly more important than this, whether he knows with certainty that he not only does in any one day, but day in andday out throughout the year. All we are proposing in turn is that of the money he spends for food in a day, a very few cents be directed to this most important part of his diet, a part for which unfortunately, he has no warning signals.ofhunger as with food itself or for salt or water, and whose inadequacy fromhis diet can ineur serious disabil ity and illness. I hope that these comments may be of help in bringing this matter into clearer focus and it is in this spirit and one of cooperation with -the larger purposes of your committee that they are offered. Yours most sincerely, WALTER A. COMPTON., M.D.120 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN MILES LABORATORIES, INC., ElkhIart, Ird., January 24, 1963.Hon. PATRICK V. iMONAMARA, Chairman, Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. MY DEAR SENATOR McNAMARA: As an officer of one of the Nation's leadingproducers of drug and pharmaceutical products, I am taking this opportunityto bring to the 'attention of you and your committee certain facts and observa-tions. They have a direct bearing on your committee's recent hearing on -theproblems of the aging; I refer particularly to the area of fraud and deceptionwhich has been practiced upon the aged and gullible by unscrupulous oppor-tunists. These additional facts deal with dietary problems especially involvingthe over-60 population of the United States. They are of public record butapparently have not been brought to the attention of you and your committee.We are pleased 'that there is an active congressional committee such as- theSenate Special Committee on Aging taking, under your direction, interest inthis very important social problem. It is a problem which has been with usfor years and has long needed attention. We heartily endorse 'the exposureand the publicity you have been able to give to proved medical hoaxes and thefrauds and deceits of other kinds as well. I note, however, in the interpretation in the press a lack of differentiationbetween the exposure of the charlatan and these areas where there is an honestdifference of opinion, even among professional experts, particularly as to theneed for vitamins to supplement those taken through the food each of us ordi-narily consumes. This is capable of creating 'a serious misinterpretation bythe public which I 'do not believe you or the committee intends. It concernsme personally both as a citizen and a doctor of medicine and as an officialof a firm that is recommending and distributing multiple vitamin tablets tothe public. May I introduce myself. I am executive vice president of Miles Laboratories,Inc., Elkhart, Ind., pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturer, established in1884. My medical degree was obtained at Harvard University Medical Schoolin 1937. I am a vice president and chairman of the executive committee of theNational Vitamin Foundation, a member of the American Medical Association,Indiana State Medical Association, Elkhart County Medical Society, the Ameri-can Association for the Advancement of Science, the Parenteral Drug Associa-tion, and the New York Academy of Science. I am also a vice president, pastpresident, of the Elkhart County Health Foundation and chairman of the Plan-ning Committee of Oaklawn Psychiatric Center of Elkhart. I am currentlychairing a newly formed committee in our county for the remedy of racial dis-crimination in housing. My associates here at Miles and throughout the pharmaceutical industry wereshocked last week to read newspaper reports of certain sweeping testimony be-fore your committee, in which \"nearly every distributor of vitamins\" was accusedof foisting \"the most lucrative deception\" on the American public. This is beingmisinterpreted by the public as they read and heard the news reports as con-demning all vitamin manufacturers and distributors as well as the productsthemselves. Senator Williams' statement in the committee on January 17 wellexemplifies this. This will raise grave doubts in the public mind regardingmanufacturers of unquestionable integrity. It is the purpose of my letter to enter in the record certain basic facts con-cerning vitamin products and valid reasons why such vitamins are an essentialsupplement to the diet of aging persons-in fact, of all age groups. In doingso I well recognize that this is in part in direct contradiction to the testimony ofthe highly qualified expert witnesses who have appeared before you.Generally speaking, there are three types of vitamin products:(1) Therapeutic, high-dosage vitamins which are usually recommendedby the physician or prescribed to treat specific identifiable deficiencies.(2) Supplemental multiple vitamins usually in tablet or capsule formwhich supply all of the vitamins and in quantities, essential to an indi-vidual's remaining in normal health. These are for people who for variousreasons want to insure their vitamin intake to prevent possible ill healththrough vitamin shortages that otherwise might be expected to occur.(3) The supplemental vitamins used as additives to bread, cereal andother foods and to \"health foods,\" especially those used for weight reduction.There are as well, unfortunately, a various multitude of products, which at-FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 121 tempt to hang on the magic of the word vitamin all varieties of spurious and imaginary benefits wholly unrelated to the normal and proper important position of these substances in normal nutrition. It is the second category-the supplementary multiple vitamin products-that we are concerned about in this message to you. We do not take issue with testimony before this committee which attacks, as well it might and should, those purveyors of vitamin products which purport to treat all manner of real- or imaginary ills from senility to impotence. Vita- mins are neither a cure-all nor any form of magic pep pill. But, they are ab- solutely essential articles of the diet without which, in adequate quantities, ill- ness and even death are certain, an inadequacy of which the individual has no warning signal through hunger as he does for example for salt or water. In any consideration of multiple vitamin consumption it is patricularly im- portant to realize that this health habit is not the result of a sudden fad. It is grounded in research done by medical and nutritional authorities over a period of years-research conducted in all parts of the Nation and among sub- jects in all walks of life. Much of these statistics on American diet habits have been provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It is not our purpose in this letter to enumerate or document the substantial body of knowledge that has been accumulated by scientists in this field. These pertinent authoritative materials are available and can be further supplied for the record of your committee. The following points summarize as briefly as possible the major reasons why our company and other reputable pharmaceutical firms serve the public by recom- mending for their use and marketing multiple vitamin preparations. With more freedom of choice than in any other country, Americans have many and varied eating habits. In addition to personal preferences, many other factors beyond our control affect what, when, and how much we eat. These include age, sex, psychological, physiological, medical, economic, geo- graphic, vocation factors, as well as those of local tradition and custom. It is true that all the individual vitamins are present in food that is avail- able for most persons to eat. However, it is also true that there is no such thing as a single standard diet for everyone. One report of a nutritional study to which we will refer later, made on aging people, appeared in the June 1962 issue of Modern Medicine Topics, and was entitled \"The Myth of the Well-Balanced Diet.\" The large quantities of multiple and special vitamin preparations which physicians find it necessary to prescribe provide evidence that vitamin deficiencies occur despite the high American standard of living and the availability of a \"well-balanced diet.\" There are no warning hunger signals by which an individual can tell he is not getting enough of the individual vitamins. A relative absence from the diet of inadequacy of any of the vitamins produces a type of illness which is exceedingly difficult to diagnose until it has become very severe. Even the diagnosis, because of its insidious onset, is apt to escape recog- nition both by the individual and by his doctor. Treatment of such a deficiency state is difficult and often complicated by other forms of illness to which the individual, especially among the aging, has thereby been exposed. In contrast the supply at a cost of less than a few cents a day of a good quality multiple vitamin supplement will wholly insure that the individual has an adequate supply of vitamins. If at one time or another it happens that one or another or even all of the vitamins in the supplement are not just at that period necessary, no harm whatsoever can result to the individual except the economic loss of somepart of the few pennies invested. It may be added that a supplemental formula designed for general use, as is true with ours, itself provides significant economy since it can, of course, be manufactured and distributed more economically than can be several specialized formulas designed for specific purposes. With specific reference to diet deficiencies in aging people, may I call yourattention to a significant researeh project reported in the March 1962 issue of American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The report, entitled \"The Nutrition of a Group of Apparently Healthy Aging Persons\" describes the results of a study made at the Age Center of New England, Inc., Boston, Mass. The study was122 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN sponsored by grants from the U.S. Public Health Service and from the National Vitamin Foundation. The findings of this research report were based upon the measurement of the daily intake of protein, vitamins, and minerals of 104 subjects at the Age Center. The results of the study showed that except for supplementation taken by the majority of these subjects there were marked deficiencies of intake of vitamin A, thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as well as certain minerals. A facsimile copy of this report as published is attached. The authors are Charles S. Davidson, M.I)., Jane Livermore, B.S., R.N., Patricia Anderson, B.S., and Seymour Kaufman, M.D. It is recognition of the above facts that our company believes that it serves the public interest in producing high quality multiple vitamin products for children and adults. The development of these products has been based upon sound scientific research. We do not advertise them as cure-alls, panaceas or as the answer to all health or nutritional problems. Our company takes pride in its products and in its mission to serve health needs of people in more than 100 nations throughout the world. We shall continue our efforts to insure high standards of quality in our products and integrity in their advertising. Our greatest concern at this point is to state as emphatically as possible that the fragmentary information about multiple vitamins that has been brought out in statements by witnesses before this committee has been, and will be ails- interpreted by the public. It will be our intention to try to help to correct these and any further misinterpretations. Your consideration is greatly appreciated. Sincerely yours, WALTER A. COMPTON, M.D., Executive Vice President. MILES LABORATORIES, INc., Elkhart, Imd., January 25, 1968. Hon. PATRICK V. McNAMARA, Chairman, Special Committee on Aging, U1.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR MONAMARA: Since writing you yesterday, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Report, edited by Wallace Werble in Washington, issue of January 21, 1963, has come to hand. It brings two quotations of Dr. Shank into proximity, and offers useful opportunity for commenting further on a point of significance to the attention of the committee. Beneath a headline which refers to the committee's work as \"Senate Hearings on Quackery and Fraud,\" these two sentences quoted from Dr. Shank appear In boldface type: \"Perhaps the most lucrative deception is perpetrated by nearly every dis- tributor of vitamins, and vitamin mineral supplements.\" declared Dr. Robert E. Shank, chairman of the AMA Council on Food and Nutrition. \"The immediate question is not whether vitamins or vitamin mineral supplements are necessary, but that the vast majority contain elements not needed in human nutrition or not shown to be lacking in conventional diets.\" It would appear to me that this shifts his argument from the need for vitamin supplements to their formulation. I am very sure that no one can argue that many vitamin products contain elements not needed in human nutrition at -all, and these we deplore as much as Dr. Shank. There is a point, however, to be made for the designing of multi- ple vitamin products so that in a single tablet all the requirements of all the essential vitamins in basic quantities needed in human nutrition are present. With the sure conviction that although some individuals may not need some few of these vitamins at any one point of time, it is precisely by designing a product for such all-purpose use that real economy and safety for all is secured. I do agree with Dr. Shank that all of these individual vitamins are to be found In varying quantities In normal foods and even in some degree in con- ventional diets, a term with many interpretations. But I am very sure that a pool taken of any group of Americans, as for example the members of your committee itself, will disclose that the majority of us recognizes that we do not eat what we know we should but we eat what pleases our tastes and hunger, or can suit our busy schedules.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 123 A glance in a full-length mirror will indicate that half of us beyond the age of 40 do not follow diets that are suited to the rules of good health. In the terms of Dr. Shank's statement, the immediate question is not whether an ade- quacy of vitamins can be obtained from a healthy diet but what are we to do about the fact that a majority of individuals, in almost absolute certainty, does not eat a carefully selected balanced diet, and about knowing that there is no way in the world for these individuals to tell with certainty that they do? Are we then, while simply asserting that they should know better, to permit the public to incur a less than satisfactory state of health when this can be so easily prevented by adding only a few pennies a day to the cost of their food intake? Essentially, we are instead offering them a part of their diet to go with the other food they obtain from their grocer, but we do assert that vitamin supple- ments are one of the most important articles of food, at the lowest cost, that they ever have the opportunity to buy. Sincerely yours, WALTER A. COMPTON, M.D., Exccutive Vice President. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH FEDERATION BY CLINTON R. MILLER, ASSISTANT TO TIME PRESIDENT Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, we wish to compliment this committee and its chairman for investigating fraud against the elderly. The National Health Federation believes in freedom of choice in matters of health where the exercise of that freedom does not interfere with the safety or health of another and thereby deny him an equal freedom. This belief in free- dom has cprtain limitations which are determined by an individual's chronolog- ical age. It is proper to give parents responsibility and authority over thehealth choices which must be Iade for mllnors. Once a person becomes of legal age, however, it has never been suggested by any previous free civilization that this freedom to make choices should be limited again just because a citizen grows older. Indeed, quite the contrary philosophy has dominated history. It has been assumed that when one is free to make choices, he will make mis- takes. Some learn and remember the lessons well, some do not. Those who skillfully apply their experiences, learned from making mistakes and avoid repeating the same error are called vise. 'Most stable civilizations have a place of reverence and respect for \"wise old men and women.\" Far from limiting the freedom of choice of these wise ones, we traditionally allow them almost unlimited rights to make judgments based upon experience. This honored place is not allowed them because they get stronger physically as they grow older. The very fact that they lasted is proof that they made more right choices than those who didn't If we now propose that someone take this honored place from the aged and place someone in a position to make choices for them, who shall we choose? If we can't trust the aged with freedom, then whom can we trust? Shall we put minors over seniors to prevent oldsters from making choices that might be wrong? Certainly it would be without precedent. His- tory yields no pattern for guidance. Natural law seems to indicate our trial would fail. When does excessive responsibility begin and where does proper concern stoo? Our members insist that if an error is to be made in matters of health it should be made on the side of freedom. We have thousands of aged mem- bers, and not a single one wvants to give up any right to make his own choice in matters of health. Our aged insist on freedom. They insist that no one shall be prevented from choosing the book, service, or product believed to be helpful to his health. They demand that they not be forced to do that to their bodies which they believe to be harmful. THE RIGHT TO BE WRONG Even our oldest and wisest members know that if they have freedom they will still make mistakes and will suffer for them, but so long as some human must make choices about their own health, they prefer to play that role them- selves. They regard, with more suspicion, an overly solicitous politician who pro- fesses undue concern over their welfare than they do a merchant or salesman or doctor who is willing to offer his wares in the free competitive American marketplace.124 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN EXCESSIVE RESPONSIBILITY On the contrary, I am instructed to report to them those pompous officials who deem it their right to abrogate to themselves excessive responsibility for choices in matters of health. They properly consider these men as far worse frauds and far worse charlatans and far worse quacks than any in the field of health, for they are despots and tyrants who would force their will on another on so intimate and sacred a matter as that of health. My role is to report to them any official, elected or appointed, who has become so arrogant that he has assumed his duty is to force a man to be well or go to jail. When we discover these self-appointed high priests over health, we work to remove them from office by due process. Tyranny in matters of health is our greatest tyranny within America today, and the National Health Federation is organized for the specific function of opposing it. At this time, I wish to state our complete accord with the stated purpose of this investigative committee. While we fight for freedom, we insist that laws be passed and enforced to punish fraud. This committee is formed to investigate fraud against the elderly and we now submit for your consideration areas of fraud that are long overdue for Senate investigation. Fraud No. 1. The fraud again8t the food and drug law The most important book ever written in America to protect American citizens from fraudulent practices against their food and drugs was authored by Harvey W. Wiley, M.D., the acknowledged father of the rood and Drug Administration. It is entitled \"The History of a Crime Against the Food Law-The Amazing Story of the National Food and Drugs Law Intended To Protect the Health of the People Perverted to Protect Adulteration of Foods and Drugs.\" We recom- mend its use as a textbook for your deliberations. This book is not a free-flow- ing novel for the shallow mind. With scissors and pastepot, Dr. Wiley collected and assembled the evidence just before his death in 1930, which reveals the greatest fraud against not only the elderly, but every American who has lived under the maladministration of this law since control of its enforcement was seized by the very commercial and professional segments that it was meant to regulate. Agencies end up being regulated by those they were set up to regulate Unless extreme care is taken by Congress, the agencies they set up to protect the citizens against frauds are soon controlled by those criminal elements they were meant to police. Dr. Harvey W. Wiley charged and we maintain that this is precisely what has happened in the greatest fraud in American history. From the time of takeover that Dr. Wiley records in this book until the present, the Food and Drug Ad- ministration has been controlled by the financial and monopolistic interests whose fraudulent practices the law was specifically written to limit. Statesmen lawmakers in Dr. Wiley's time valiantly fought to pass the pure food law of 1906. The interests who fought this bill, failing in their control of Congress, immediately seized control of the enforcement agency, the FDA. Dr. Wiley spent the first part of his life fighting to get the legislation passed. In this he was joined by Theodore Roosevelt. Dr. Wiley spent the last part of his life trying to honestly enforce the law he had fathered. In this he failed, and this long suppressed book reveals the fantastic incident that caused President Theodore Roosevelt to become an enemy of Dr. Wiley and not only withdraw his support, but set up the pattern by which the FDA could be maneuvered and con- trolled by the monopolistic and fraudulent interests who had so bitterly fought passage of the legislation. I respectfully request that at the end of my statement that the following abstracts or articles be included into the record of this committee hearing: 1. Pages 372-402 from Dr. Harvey.W. Wiley's book \"The History of a Crime Against the Food Law.\" These pages briefly summarize Dr. Wiley's amazing Ftory of how the national food and drugs law, which was intended to protect the health of the people, was perverted to protect adulteration of foods and drugs. 2.

Fromthe earliest days of food regulation the use of alum in foods has been con-demned. It is universally acknowledged as a poisonous and deleterious sub-stance in all countries. The United States is the only country which permits,of course illegally, the addition of alum to our food supply.\" Fraud. No. I-B. The illegal sale of bleached flour and Coca-Cola On page 400 of Dr. Wiley's book, he stated: \"The next most important stepis to secure from the officials enforcing the Food and Drug Act is recognitionof the actions of the courts under the operation of the Food 'and Drug Act inconvicting the manufacturers of bleached -flour and Coca-Cola. In all thesecases judgments of -the Court condemning 'the use of all these substances weresecured. but in no case was any effort ever made by the enforcing officers tofollow up the Court decision. By reason of this fact interstate commerce infoods containing bleached flour. benzoate of soda, sulfur dioxide, and suphites.together with soft drinks containing caffein, such as 'Coca-Cola, go on unimpededand unrestricted in all parts of the United States. The health of our people isconstantly threatened by the use of these articles in our food.It is a matter of common knowledge that the practice continues today despitethe Court decisions establishing its illegality. Fraud. No. 1-C. FDA approval of saccharin in foods for nonmedicinal purposes Section 125.7 of the Food. Drug, and Cosmetic Act, published June 20, 1962,in the Federal Register, is a proposed reversal of the original intent of thepure food law, protecting the consumer from the use of saccharin and othercoal tar nonnutritive sweeteners except those specifically manufactured andlabeled with appropriate warnings for medicinal purposes. On page 401 ofhis 'book, Dr. Wiley stated: If the Bureau of Chemistry had been permitted toenforce the law as it was written and as it tried to do, what would have beenthe condition now? No food. product in our country would have any traceof * * * saccharin [emphasis ours], save for medicinal purposes.\"The above-proposed FDA ruling will allow saccharin in all foods. It is acomplete reversal of the intent of the American people, their Congress, andDr. Harvey Wiley. This is real fraud. Not only does Mr. Larrick's FDA re-fuse to prosecute in this field. but he now proposes to compound the crime bymaking legal the universal use of this toxic adulterant.Here are the economic motivations. Saccharin costs $1.60 per pound. It is350 times sweeter than sugar, and 1 pound can Teplace 350 pounds of sugar 'atan average cost of $W5. For every pound of this coal tax toxic chemical thatcan be used to replace 350 pounds of sugar, there is a profit of $33.50. Where isa greater fraud than 'this? 94703 0-63--pt. 1-9126 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN FDA'S SMOKESCREEN ATTACK ON \"HEALTH FOODS QUACKERY\" AND \"FOOD FANATICS\" Why does Mr. Larrick's FDA attack Dr. Harvey W. Wiley's followers as \"food fanatics\"? Whenever past Congresses have been prodded by Dr. Wiley's followers to ask embarrassing questions of FDA, which revealed preventable deaths and injury because of FDA's refusal to prosecute the real food and drug criminals as Dr. Harvey Wiley did, they throw out a smoke screen to set Congress off the scent and play a cracked record, that shouts over and over, \"food fanatic,\" \"nutritional nonsense,\" \"health food quackery,\" etc. etc. ad nauseam. It must be admitted that in the past It has temporarily baffled Congress, and effective investigations have been sidetracked. However, before this committee, the false charges of quackery came early enough in the 88th session that future hearings will give a chance for Congress to hear the other side and judge just who is responsible for frauds and crimes against the food and drug laws of our country. In this regard, the National Health Federation sincerely compliments the Honorable Senator McNamara for holding his hearings so promptly after the opening of the 88th Congress. Although many of the first witnesses were \"smoke screen\" witnesses, we are sure that future hearings before this committee will reveal the real fraud against the health of the aged and all other Americans that will substantiate Dr. Harvey Wiley's charges. Which are the real villains-wholesome health foods or danterous drugs, pesti- cides, preservatives, and additives with fatal and deforming side effects? Mr. Larrick submitted to your committee a tabulation showing the enforcement activities that have been brought in the Federal courts in the 18-month period ending December 31, 1962. Mr. Larrick proudly boasted that there were twice as many prosecutions against harmless food products as there were against drugs. He said: \"Very briefly, there were 97 seizures of food supplements, * * * and 49 seizures of drugs; * *.\" He then listed 41 pages of actions taken in Federal courts in the last 18 months against admittedly perfectly harmless, clean, safe, and wholesome vitamin products, sea salt, sea water, vinegar, honey, herbs, protein tablets, vegetable juices, safflour oil, molasses, and whole wheat cookies, millet and sesame seed pancake mix, wheat germ, dehydrated fruits and vegetables, etc. Nowhere is it claimed that these products were harmful to health. By comparison, not a single jail sentence, not a single arrest or fine, not even a single listing of any manufacturer of thalidomide or Merk 29 (which resulted in the death of 53 people) appears anywhere in the record to indicate that there was a single punitive action taken by the FDA in these matters. Mr. Larrick has deliberately ignored the real danger areas where deaths and de- formities could have been prevented by honest FDA enforcement but proudly boasts of his record of harrassment in prosecuting \"health foods\" manufacturers of sea salt, vitamins, vinegar and honey and assumes that he has been success- ful in convincing both the Congress and the American public that these are the real villains against whom the FDA was organized to act. 'Who is the father of this statement: \"$500 million in health foods quackery\"? This figure was first Invented at the AMA-FDA Congress on Medical Quack- ery In 1961 and seems to be without an author. No one will accept responsibility for making the original statement, nor will anyone break It down. To see how deliberately vicious this statement is, consider the following facts: The entire health foods Industry does less than $100 million a year. So obviously $400 mil- lion of the $500 million is something other than \"health foods.\" It may be drug quackery, or grocery quackery, or some other form of quackery but it is extremely unfair to attack \"health foods\" as a two-word preface to a figure of $500 mil- lion when the entire industry is not one-fifth that large. When \"pinned down\" for an exact estimate of the dollar volume of the legitimate health foods industry that Is \"quackery,\" these AMA-FDA spokesmen who are so careless with their smears before a dignified Senate committee back away in pretended innocence. They assure both Congress and the press that they aren't talking about health food stores. If they aren't, then whom are they talking about? How irrespon- sible can one be in smearing an entire industry? SMEAR-AND-RUN TACTICS The National Health Federation draws this matter to this committee's atten- tion with a respectful request that in all future hearings quackery be listed with- out a smear preface that reflects unfairly upon the honest activities of thousandsFRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 127 of sincere and hard working American business people. The NHF deplores the smear-and-run tactics of the AMA-FDA spokesmen before your committee in at- tacking an entire reputable American industry in this reprehensible manner. \"'FOOD FANATIC\" One of the most Important tasks that this committee can accomplish is to bringto earth a definition of a \"food fanatic.\" Harvey W. Wiley was called a food fanatic by those who opposed the passage and enforcement of the pure food law. Those who follow him today are likewise labeled. What are a \"food fanatic's\" beliefs? Are his beliefs a threat to the health and safety of others? One of the things that caused early religious \"fanaticism\" was the discovery of the print- ing press. The wider distribution of books, especially the Bible, caused certain men to read and interpret new \"fanatical\" interpretations to Scriptures. Isthere a similarity between those who today demand freedom of choice in matters of health and insist on reading about and choosing nonorthodox roads to health,and those early martyrs who insisted on freedom of choice in matters of religion?If a \"food fanatic\" today is sincerely concerned about Rachel Carson's book, \"Silent Spring,\" and tries to get foods without poison pesticide residues through health food stores, does he then become a subject for inquisitorial legislation? FREEDOM OF PRESS IN MATTERS OF HEALTH Earlier witnesses attacked books and their publishers that advertised what they described as fake cures. Among those mentioned were \"Bee Venom,\" by Dr. Joseph Broadman, published by Putnam; \"Athritis Can Be Cured,\" by Dr. Bernard Ashner, published by Julian Press, and \"Athritis and Folk Medicine,\" by Dr. D. C. Jarvis, published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston. The National Health Federation strongly defends these and other publishers' rights and insists it is their constitutional duty to publish any book they want on health. We deplore the arrogance of any individual or association who would assume the right of prior censorship of all health literature. The best way to reveal the motives of those who desire censorship power is to read that which they desire to censor. The National Health Federation holds no brief for or against arguments of Joseph Broadman, M.D. as outlined in his book, \"Bee Venom.\" We simply believe that no person in America should be prevented from publishing or reading any book on health that he desires. We submit for the record his chapter No. 7 which follows: CHAPTER VII. MY FIGHT FOR BEE VENOM RECOGNITION, BY DR. JOSEPH BROADMAN \"As pointed out in the other chapters, certain powerful forces in official medi- cal circles are hindering the spread of knowledge about bee venom as a treatment for arthritis and rheumatism. Two principal agents in the fight against the acceptance of bee venom as a legitimate treatment are the drug firms, which discover, promote, and sell steroids, and the leaders of the medical profession. who choose to remain slaves to steroid treatment. A third contributing element is the strength of old. outmoded fabrications that linger on in the memory of some physicians, even prominent ones. \"From a purely material standpoint, the pharmaceutical industry in this country has a great deal to gain from large-scale production of the various corti- costeroids. Bee venom costs much less than the latest steroid hormones; and the drug companies realize that fully. By making bee venom scarce, they force the doctor to use the steroid treatment for arthritis and rheumatism. In this case they have a conflict of interests. While they exist to serve the medical profession by making available the best of drugs and medications, they are also dedicated to profit from their efforts. \"As recent committee investigations show in detail, the companies continue to promote extensively their new drugs, without regard to their real efficacy. They boldly claim all sorts of good to accrue from their products, but in smallprint they add, as a precaution, that a still better remedy is in the offing. Thus, the public is encouraged to believe they have the best of medication when theymay actually have an intermediate, and possibly unsuccessfuL remedy. \"Much more responsible than the drug companies are the so-called leaders of the medical profession, for they hold the reins of research. They are slaves to steroids. Because they lack courage to free themselves, they have jeopardized our chance to progress.128 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN \"The blame must be laid at their feet for having so long ignored the flood of literature from Europe on bee venom and its power in healing arthritis and rheumatism. As much as the public, and possibly more, doctors need education regarding this therapy. \"Acceptance of a false belief can do irreparable harm to one afflicted with arthritis. If he chooses the wrong method of treatment, he will suffer with no chance of permanent relief, of being restored to health and a useful life. If apathy and doubt crowd out hope, he can forfeit effective permanent relief. The responsibility of medical leaders is to handle the problem of these two crippling diseases with courage and foresight. \"The strength of hand-me-down tales of bee stings and their effects on rheu- matism and arthritis sufferers lingers on, cropping up occasionally in the opinions of promient physicians. This tendency of outmoded opinion to rule modern science is illustrated by the following incident. \"About 3 years ago, an eminent physician with an international reputation, Dr. Walter C. Alvarez, wrote in his syndicated newspaper column that bee 'venom was useless for the treatment of rheumatism and arthritis. The entire article was based, not on recent research, but on his experience of 50 years ago. \"About the turn of the century, the daily press reported on a severely afflicted arthritic who, after being attacked by a swarm of bees and painfully stung, had recovered the use of his joints. Since physicians believed at that time that formic acid was the chief ingredient of bee venom, some began to inject the acid around the joints of their arthritis and rheumatism patients. None recovered and the doctors, soon discouraged by their efforts, wrongly declared that bee venom had no curative powers. \"Actually, they had proved that formic acid had no such ability. But 50 years later, our friend was willing to write a column based completely on his experience as a young intern who had also tried formic acid. He even seemed unaware that research had established that formic acid is not even an ingredient of the bee poison. \"After reading the article, I wrote a letter to Dr. Alvarez on November 25, 1958, In which I stated: \"' * * * If you still believe what you wrote 3 years ago, I would like to explain that the reason your 50 patients did not get well, or did not get any benefit from the formic acid injections, is because there is no formic acid in bee venom.\"'It is perfectly true that 50 years ago it was believed that formic acid was an important constituent of the venom. However, the work of a number of re- search workers since that time proves that formic acid is not at all a constituent of bee venom. \"'Should you wish to look further into the subject, I respectfully refer to you the work * * *(about a dozen references were cited). Finally. I take the liberty to quote from the above-cited work of Forster (Karl August Forster; reference not reprinted here) in which he sums up the subject: \"'Summarizing, it can now be said that there is no further doubt that in dealing with. the effective portion of bee venom, we are dealing with a protein- like substance.\"' Not having heard from you in a long time, I hope that this will find you in good health, and thanking you for past courtesies. Sincerely yours, JOSEPH BROADMAN, M.D. \"To this I received a reply dated December 1, 1958, reading: \"DEAR DR. BROADMAN: Thank you for your letter. Yes, several people called my attention to my mistake * * * \"Cordially, \"WALTER ALVAREZ, M.D.\" \"Although the physician frankly admitted his mistake to me in a private letter, he did not make a public retraction, to the best of my knowledge. In- stead, he compounded the error by attacking bee venom in 1961, in virtually the same language he had used previously. It is almost inconceivable to me how a physician of his standing can apologize privately to me, admitting his 'mis- take' and then later repeat the same mistake in public print. He owes it to his readers and to the public in general to rectify an error that he has helped to perpetuate. By writing these two misleading articles, he has undoubtedly renewed many physician's hostility to the most effective treatment known today for arthritis and rheumatism.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 129 \"By way of comparison, Dr. Herman N. Bundesen (now deceased) was alsoan eminent physician with an international reputation. Among his many public and civic activities, Dr. Bundesen also contributed a syndicated medicalcolumn to some of the country's best newspapers. On December 31, 1958, he, too,wrote an article for his papers on the subject of bee venom. Here is what hewrote: \"'Bee sting may relieve rheumatism. \"'About 11 million Americans suffer from arthritis, rheumatism, or one of the other rheumatic diseases. \" 'Chances are overwhelming that not a single one of them is a beekeeper. \"'Now you may snicker at this fact, but it has real medical significance. Forcenturies the general public has attributed the virtual immunity of beekeepersfrom arthritis and rheumatism to the repeated stings of bees.\"'Ancient physicians, and even some during much more recent times, be-lieved that the stings of bees helped prevent arthritis and rheumatism andhelped cure them after they had developed. \"'Apparently their patients complained of the technique, however, fortreating persons with the bee stings isn't practiced any more. At least I hope itisn't. \"'Yet the beneficial factor of the bee sting is readily available. Not onlyhas bee venom been Isolated and purified, it even has been standardized.\"'Dr. Joseph Broadman, who has made quite a study of the value of beevenom in treating rheumatism and arthritis reported in a recent issue of GeneralPractice that tens of thousands of persons have been treated with this methodwithout any side effects, complications, or fatalities. \"'He said those who have had experience with bee venom praise it very highly.And he says that use of bee venom in such cases \"merits the careful considerationof the general practitioner.\" \"'Now Dr. Broadman, who has had scientific papers published by numerousmedical journals, doesn't claim that this form of treatment will cure all patients.However, he does feel that bee venom will give \"large numbers\" of rheumaticand arthritic patients \"substantial relief.\" \"'Many early cases, he adds, will obtain permanent relief, although otherswill get only partial results. Some, of course, will get no benefit at all.\"'The simplicity of the use of bee venom,' Dr. Broadman says, 'lends itself tothe practice of general practitioners everywhere.\"' \"With the aid of a few others, I have tried to spread knowledge of the advan-tages of bee venom treatments for sufferers from arthritic and rheumatic dis-eases. To gain the meager success achieved so far has required extreme effort.\"I managed to achieve publication In only one medical journal. in the UnitedSlates (General Practice, see appendix). Then all avenues closed for futurearticles on bee venom. The first article was mailed to- nearly every medicaljournal in the country. Two or three responded favorably, but did not publishthe article. One journal accepted, only to return the article to me near publi-cation time. The explanation: Two members of the editorial committee, whowere especially interested in arthritis and rheumatism, 'objected' to its publica- tion. \"Another journal's editor wrote me, stating the article would be consideredfor publication if revised In accordance with certain specifications. I gladlyagreed to rewrite the article and when submitted, it was promptly accepted.But when the article reached the executive office, I received a letter (in October 1957) informing me that the article would be published in early 1958. More than4 years have passed and the article has not been published and my correspond- ence has been ignored. \"While on the subject of rejection slips, let me list another one. I sent anarticle to a medical journal with a national circulation emphasizing that anygeneral practitioner could treat patients suffering from arthritis or rheumatismwith bee venom and could secure far better results (not exposing his patients to the dangers of side effects and complications, for example) than with thesteriods now in use. The publication had asked its readers to contribute articles which might interest or help other physicians or their patients. \"Since I thought it a good opportunity to publicize vital information not avail- able in most medical journals, I prepared a special article in which, after stating the facts as persuasively as possible, I presented a bibliography of no less than 85 articles (on the subject of bee venom) written by well-known authorities inEurope and in America. All related some experiences with the treatment for130 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN all forms of arthritis and rheumatism. Surely, I reasoned, so important an array of confirmation and proof would move the editors into accepting the article. \"I was wrong. With the explanation 'it doesn't quite meet our needs,' my manuscript was returned. Their needs could be easily seen from the journal's contents, which dealt mainly with economic problems relating to the practice of medicine. Its entire income seems to come from page after page of pharma- ceutical advertising. \"Here we can see another possible reason for the difficulties I have en- countered. A publisher of a medical journal does not like to print material to which his advertisers may object, or which recommends medical remedies not prominently advertised. If those advertised products were as good as hoped. this sensitivity might be excused. But the steroids (to be specific) are not beneficial for arthritic and rheumatic sufferers. \"What is the physician's usual answer to the patient who asks about bee venom as a method of treatment for his arthritic or rheumatic condition? Let's follow a friend of an arthritic patient of mine. Having heard that his friend has obtained relief from me through bee venom, he decides to talk the matter over with his own physician. ThI doctor's stock answer goes something like this: \"'Mr. H, like many arthritic patients, you have been coming here for some time. From the very beginning I have been telling you that nothing more can be done than is being done here. I have told the same to other patients, and others have been consulted to confirm my opinion. If there's any good in the bee venom treatment I must confess skepticism and a certain amount of ig- norance regarding its value.' \"And what the doctor does not know is that hundreds of doctors abroad have used bee venom in the successful treatment of tens of thousands of patients without one serious complication, side effects, or fatality. I have had the same results with many of my patients who have been relieved of suffering and, in many other cases, completely cured. Patients are cured within 3 weeks. sometimes within 6 months. In extreme cases treatment may last an entire year or even more. Often I can only arrest pain or give a partial result. I make no fantastic claims. Yet many patients have come to me after years of treatment from other doctors and, while skeptical of new methods, were overjoyed to learn that they could lead normal, healthy lives in place of ones filled with pain and frustration. \"I have earned many enemies and few friends precisely because I insist on clarifying the most efficient and beneficial methods of treatment for rheumatism and arthritis. There are many people, however, who do not want the truth preserved. Education to them is a farce. In creating the Broadman Library on War, Peace, and International Relations I did not seek praise, but only the preservation of truth for future generations. Even in that work some criticized me for not devoting my full time to the practice of medicine. In the same way, others oppose truth in medical science.\" BOTH SIDES SHOULD BE HEARD The National Health Federation again emphasizes that it is not defending the theories of Dr. Broadman. We do maintain, however, that Dr. Broadman and Putnam publishers should be given a chance to appear before this committee and publicly present their side. To give any publisher or physician the un- favorable publicity that was given to Putnam, Dr. Broadman, and others with- out a chance to be heard is certainly unfair. It amounts to a trial by press release without a chance to reply. This committee is certainly not responsible for statements made by witnesses before it, but it is completely responsible for the agenda, and the National Health Federation urges it to hold further hearings and schedule those who were unfairly smeared by its first witnesses. MUZZLING OF THE MEDICO The American Medical Association is attempting to enforce upon the American public an unlimited prior censorship of the press on everything involving health. The top echelon of the AMA and the FDA have apparently joined hands in a deliberate, well-organized, criminal conspiracy to enforce a medical pionopoly in all matters of health upon the American people.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING TME OLDER CITIZEN 131 PRIOR CENSORSHIP IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL The National Health Federation urges this committee to consider carefully the unguarded attacks by prior witnesses upon some of America's greatest pub- lishing houses-G. P. Putnam's Winston; and Julian Press. The NHF will fight for the constitutional right of any person to publish or read any book or literature on health that he desires. We are deeply alarmedat the inroads into this freedom that has been made by the AMA through itshidden influence and control of FDA, FTC,. FCC. and the Post Office. The NHF intends to expose this conspiracy, and regards it as one of the most serious men- aces to American freedom today. By listing books and literature as labeling, the AMIA-FDA has imposed censorship power to areas that were never intended by Congress. This must be corrected. The National Health Federation does not need to defend or be responsible forthe theories on health that are published in order to defend the right of pub-lishers to freedom of the press. Freedom means the right to have and publish wrong theories, as well as right ones. A mistake in health can be fatal, It Is true, but we allow freedom in religion, where a mistake could be eternal. In the fundamental things of life a man must be free. The National Health Federation compliments the chairman and members of this committee for early and timely investigation into frauds against the aged. A serious problem does exist In this field, and we encourage you to probe until you have fully uncovered the greatest fraud of all-that which was revealed by Dr. Harvey W. Wiley. PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS AsSOCIATION, Washington, D.C., January 31, 1963.Hon. PAT McNAMARA, Ch airman, Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR 'McNAMARA: The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, representing 140 ethical drug manufacturers producing 90 percent of the Nation's prescription products, followed with interest the recent hearings of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging on medical quackery, of which you are chairman. We have long concerned ourselves with this challenge to legitimate medical care, and its tragic effects upon young and old alike. We were particularly in agreement with your statement, made December 30, 1962, in a news release. as follows: \"I have been informed there have been no congressional hearings specifically and extensively on quackery and nostrums. Certainly the consumer needs and is entitled to more information.\" In a speech just 2 years previously, on December 12, 1960, I pointed out that investigation of the drug industry earlier that year might well, at least In part, have turned to this problem of \"useless quack cures.\" \"Indeed,\" I told a Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association regional meet- ing. \"the publicity 'alone from such an investigation would be of incalculable public benefit. quite apart from legal actions likely to 'follow such an expose. Amplified by Congress, the warnings not only of the Cancer Society and the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation. but hundreds of professional and pub- lic service organizations in -the health field. would boom across the land. Thou- sands of 'afflicted people might be prevented from falling prey to health rackets 9nd racketeers. Moreover, congressional interest could add muscle and morale to 'the Food and Drug Administration in its -tireless effort to track down and weed out substandard and dangerous drugs. \"And such an investigation would, I remind you, -have the enthusiastic sup-port 'and cooperation of our pharmaceutical industry.\" Our continuing concern is indicated by an article, \"The Tragicomedy of Quackery,\" beginning on page 2 of the enclosed copy of Medicine at Work, our monthly external p)ublication. Perhaps you will find it useful in your present study. Sincerely, AUSTIN 'SMITH, M.D.132 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN [From Medicine at Work, October 1961]. Health humbuggery-In sum * * * Each year an estimated 100,000 health phonies victimize 25 million Americans. In return for a billion-dollar take, they undermine health and spawn disappointment. The humbug whips up a spark coil here and an atomic sounding name there. He adds such \"glories\" of nature as sea water, tosses in a glowing testimonial, and sprinkles liberally with sweet and double bubble talk. Hear his spiel: \"We have blackstrap molasses and substitutes for glasses. Root pills, garlic pills, alfalfa pills for all your ills. Sick? You got it, we explain it. Remedy? You ask it, we arrange it. Money? You borrow it, we take it. Phoney? You lie-we deny! It's all here, folks-potions and lotions, hair growers and sinus blowers, rheu- matism cures and virility lures, surgical bosom fills and antistupidity pills. So step right up * ! e\" * * * and substance-So long as people desire health, and feel they are not being satisfied quickly or easily through legitimate channels,. they will be setups for deception. The double-pronged solution lies in divide and conquer-expose and smash the sharpies on the one hand, and effectively alert the public to quackery's perils and waste on the other. Despite 3.500 years of health chicanery, there are glimmers of hope that such a strategy might work. A HARVEST OF DOLLARS, LIES AND DEATH In the south German town of Burg Preppach, door-to-door medicine peddlers have a sure-fire pitch. \"Take one of these tablets each morning and night,\" they say, \"and your brain will become sharp as a buzz saw.\" The staff Is nothing more than sugar but, so far as the buyer is concerned, it really works. Local police have given up trying to jail the quacksters because nobody who buys the \"antistupidity\" pills will admit he has been gypped. There are no complaints, either, from a Chicago man who stopped taking insulin after falling for the \"magic spike.\" This pencil-sized glass tube, con- taining less than a penny's worth of barium chloride but costing $306, came with directions to \"hang this around your neck and its rays will cure any disease you have.\" No complaints because the man is dead-diabetic coma. Such is the tragicomic opera of the- health phoney-clown and killer, corny con man and ruthless robber. He may be a smalltime half-informed cheat or a knowledgeable, cold-blooded quack millionaire. Are you amused at the spiel in his office, at his tent meeting, across his store counter, outside your door, through his mailings? Or, maybe you are so desperately in need of help that you hang onto his every word? It matters not to the medicaster. He would just as soon hear a laugh as a sigh when he reaches for your money. A smirk doesn't faze him, either. For, medical quackery in America is far from trivial. While there are no exact totals, reports from the Post -Office Department, other Federal agencies, State license examiners, national health organizations, bet- ter business bureaus and independent investigators indicate that: Health chicanery is practiced by at least 100,000 fakers whose \"specialties\" range from arthritis and cancer, to food fads and kitchen-table abortion; from diabetes and sex, to high blood pressure and hypnosis. More than 25 million Americans a year fall prey to this humbuggery. whether they swallow some line on a bogus health tonic or let themselves be strapped against an Impressive-looking \"invigorator\" machine. Of these victims, at least 5 million suffer serious health setbacks, and thousands are hastened toward death. The annual take of this racket in all its phases probably exceeds $1 bil- lion, with the breakdown by category as follows: Arthritis.-This most fertile field for quackery yields a harvest of $250 mil- lion annually from nearly half of the Nation's 12 million arthritics, according to the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation. As yet, there is no cure for the disease. More than 10,000 charlatans bank on statements such as this one from a Los Angeles victim who paid $600 to a faith healer: \"I know if's ridiculous, but I'm so desperate I'll spend any amount to get rid of this pain. Of course, the pain is still there.\" Cancer.-Four thousand phonies, says the American Cancer Society, make a killing of $50 million yearly. Those with curable cancer die unnecessarily. those who cannot be cured are denied effective relief from pain, and those un- afflicted who are led to believe they have cancer are disfigured by caustic con- coctions. As with arthritis, another result is financial suffering.FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 133 Illegal abortion.-The incompetents in this operation take in between $150 and $300 million a year, and are responsible for at least 5,000 deaths. In a recent series in the Saturday Evening Post, seasoned reporter John Bartlow Martin calls abortion the Nation's third biggest racket (after gambling and narcotics). Fods fad8 and 8elf-prescribed n08truvm8.-Upward of 10,000 gyp artists, who haunt the fringes of truthful presentation with their fact-twisting pitches, are directly engaged in parting the sucker from his money. The combined take most likely is more than $300 million annually, and-although this is not always outright quackery-there are more victims of financial weakening than In any other form of health deception. A recent Post Office survey reveals that this category represents the most popular health fraud in the United States. Psychoquackery.-Not even an official \"guestimate\" is available of the number of these fringe operators, but their loot certainly is in excess of $50 million annually, according to individual psychiatrists who often must undo the damage of those posing as metaphysicians, dianeticauditors, astrolotherapists, scientolo- gists, theosophists, therapeutic hyponotists, etc. Several States recently began prosecuting these imposters for violating medical practice laws. Other.-The desperate diabetic, the bewildered venereal disease carrier, the skin disease sufferer, the balding, the impotent, the flat-chested, others who find it easy to believe there are short-cut remedies outside the truly remarkable advances of established medical science-they also enrich the imposters in health. By how much? \"If you put the figure at $100 million, you probably are undershooting the mark,\" say a veteran medical fraud investigator in Washington. FORTUNES, HEARTBREAK, ACTION One U.S. Cabinet officer has publicly described quackery as \"more lucrative than any other criminal activity.\" Postal authorities figure that the mail-order volume alone in worthless nostrums and health gadgets comes to $50 million a year. Even more is pocketed by door-to-door dispensers of dubious health remedies, according to GP, official journal for family physicians. Fortunes of individual health promoters have ranked with those of the gambling czars, vice kings, and narcotics bosses-at least $1 million a year each, for example, to the flamboyant goat-glander John R. Brinkley, the Denver cultist Leo Spears, and naturopath Harry Hoxsey. Before a Federal court cracked down on Hoxsey in 1960, cancer patients had paid an estimated $50 million for his worthless treatment over a 10-year period. \"The quasi-medical underworld grosses each year from its victims a sum equal to half the annual sales of ethical drugs by legitimate companies,\" Austin Smith, M.D., president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said last December. \"This shadow zone of wasteful medical cost requires as much exposure as its attendant heartbreak and death. When one witness told the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly about these charlatans, never had a congressional inquiry been handed a finer opportunity to launch a public crusade against criminal operatives in the health field. And what happened? Nothing.\" But while the subcommittee failed to pursue the opportunity, others did. This month (October 6, and 7), in Washington, D.C. leaders in health, business, law enforcement and communications are meeting in a First National Congress on Medical Quackery, sponsored jointly by the American Medical Association and the Food and Drug Administration. Their objective is to split the sharpie from his victim-it takes at least two to tangle into fraud-by developing more effec- tive blows against the charlatans, and better educating the public to quackery's perils and waste. WHY THEY GO TO QUACKS This is no simple task. So long as women want beauty, men want virility, parents want strong children, and the sick want relief from suffering-so long as people desire health, and are not satisfied quickly or easily through legitimate channels, the pseudologist will emerge, ready to exploit them. It is because of this common human denominator of \"perfection in wish\" that quackery, dating back to 1500 B.C., sometimes is called the second oldest profession. At times, the denominator plumbs fantastic depths. Little more than a genera- tion ago. thousands of followers of health faddist Horace Fletcher were eagerly heeding his advice to chew each mouthful of food (even soup) 32 times-one for each tooth. Other cultists earnestly believed that women who adhered to the134 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN diet program of \"Professor\" Arnold Ehret could expect \"immaculate conception.\" Ten thousand disciples of Dinshah Ghadali conscientiously slept only with the head pointing north. Other desperate patients still -have implicit faith in the advice of a present-day cancer quack who prescribes a certain root \"which must be pulled with the left hand at the rise of the moon on Friday the 13th.\" Faith, a potent and legitimate factor in orthodox physician-patient rapport, accounts for the isolated successes of some charlatans. Is it not medicine's challenge to demonstrate that while faith and science may indeed work miracles, one cannot fully succeed without the other? It would seem so, according to two recent reports. One is from Dr. Albert Helser, who notes that Nigerian witch doctors have been losing so much prestige lately that now they give aspirins with their incantations. The other is from a Houston physician who found the blood pressure of one of his hypertensive patients actually dropped after she fol- lowed the advice of a visiting witch doctor-that she wear 9 cloves around her neck on a silken thread. The Houston physician is advising her to wear her cloves and to take the medicine. WHAT CAN BE DONE While the health racketeer cashes in most heavily with the mass-appeal spiel, not even the supposedly sophisticated are completely immune to his pitch. Among those who have fallen for the sharpie talk were George Washington (he praised a worthless health gadget), former Mayor Ed Kelly of Chicago (he defended the \"magic spike\"), and the late U.S. Senator William Langer (he actively supported a fake cancer cure). Oliver Field, whose department of investigation at the American Medical As- sociation handles 4,000 quack inquiries annually, is able to verify from his half million index cards that quackery in the United States knows no economic, educational, or cultural barriers among its victims. An authority on cardio- vascular diseases, Dr. William H. Gordon, says: \"When it comes to thinking in terms of disease and death, we are not far removed from our distant forefathers, who believed in mysticism and magic and employed amulets and charms for protection.\" At the same time, certain trends indicate that health humbuggery, and the gullibility on which it feeds, may yet be licked by concerted action of individuals in diverse groups: The growing efforts of health group leaders to expose and correct abuses of the few incompetents and charlatans who hide behind professional degrees. The fearless campaigns in all communications media to focus a spotlight of publicity on the implied stripes of humbuggery: Quick cure, secret cure, guaranteed cure, suppressed cure, testimonial proof of cure. The increasing enlightenment which has made legislators more persuasive and law officers more alert in attacks on the phonies. The recognition by more and more physicians that traditional courtesy, concern, and confidence need not be a lost art in medicine-that the brusk or callous abandonment of a terminal cancer patient, for example, is the surest way of sending him to a sweet-talking quack. Concurrently, ethical pharmaceutical and other orthodox scientific advances at last are uncovering tangible solutions to disease and disability problems which have stumped mankind for centuries. This progress, together with the healing touch of conservative medical practice, can enable patients to glimpse more hope in fact than in fantasy. THE BAYER CO., New York, N.Y., February 20, 1963. Hon. HARRIsoN A. WILLIAMS, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR WILLAMS: In your presence on January 14, before the Senate Special Subcommittee on Aging, Mr. Oliver Field, director, Department of Investigation of the American Medical Association, stated: \"Now, the truth is if you buy it (aspirin tablets) for 10 cents a hundred, or a dollar a hundred, it is all the same.\" (Transcript, p. 71, parentheses added.)FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 135 Senator, this is not the truth. This is a serious error and one which shouldcertainly be corrected In the interests of the American public of all ages and,particularly, in the interests of many of your constituents. You are probably aware that our plant in Trenton manufactures all theBayer aspirin tablets used in the United States. Perhaps you are not awarethat, on the basis of Bayer aspirin production in Trenton alone, more aspirintablets are manufactured in the great State of New Jersey than in any otherState in the United States and, indeed, more than in any other State or countryin the entire world. In the year 1962 more than 6'A2 billion Bayer aspirintablets were manufactured in our plant in Trenton. We understand that Dr. Blasingame, executive vice president of the AmericanMedical Association, and on behalf of that organization, has written to SenatorPatrick McNamara as chairman of the Special Committee on Aging pointingout that Mr. Field's statement was actually contrary to the view of theAmerican Medical Association and explaining that the medical profession recognizes and relies on the fact that products composed of the same chemicalingredients are by no means the same in physiological activity and effectiveness.I commend this correspondence to you and to the committee. Because of the Importance of this matter and the wide publicity which Mr.Field's statement has received I do not think it should be concluded without a statement from our company whose product has been disparaged and who, afterall, is the world's leading authority on aspirin. Although excellent and correctin every way, Dr. Blasingame's letter does not and cannot call upon the wealthof factual background and experience which we have at our command. Accord-ingly, I would like to develop certain features of this subject for you.I assume that everyone would concede that all items in a given generic classare not necessarily the same. All aspirin is not the same for very much thesame reason that-to cite a few examples-all automobiles are not the same, thatall radios and television sets are not the same, and that all brands of chocolate ice cream are not the same. Important differences between Bayer aspirin tablets and other aspirin tabletsresult from qualitative differences in basic raw materials, in manufacturing andpackaging methods, in the skill, care, and experience of manufacturing per-sonnel, in particular product specifications, and in the number on types of con-trols imposed. Let's look at some of these differences and see what they mean.Bayer aspirin tablets differ from aspirin tablets made to minimum U.S.P.standards in purity, in stability, and in their resulting uniformity of therapeutic effectiveness and performance. They also differ in their relative freedom fromacetic acid odor, in the rate and uniformity of disintegration and in theuniformity of available fine particles during and at the end of disintegration. Among the reasons for the rapid disintegration of Bayer aspirin tablets are the specific proportions of special corn starch, the unique waterless method by whichthe acetysalicylic acid itself is made, as well as the use of unique apparatus andmethods in the tableting process. From the beginning of the manufacturing process until the tablet leaves theplant, Bayer scientists perform over 100 separate laboratory tests to insure theuniformity, quality, potency, and purity of Bayer aspirin tablets for adults. Over 200 such tests are made in connection with Bayer aspirin for children.The Bayer method and technique of preparing, manufacturing, and tabletingaspirin tablets is distinctive and, in many important respects, is substantiallydifferent from, and much more expensive than that of all other manufacturers. Aspirin was first introduced in the United States by our Bayer Co. at the turnof the century. We put Bayer aspirin out in tablet form in 1915. Unlike mostother manufacturers of aspirin tablets, we make our own tablets from theground up. Moreover, the entire Bayer aspirin production is used in Bayeraspirin tablets and not sold under any other brand name. Although the chemicalconfiguration of Bayer aspirin is no different from that of aspirin that meetsU.S.P. specifications, Bayer aspirin has always been made by a unique process--a process quite different from that used in the manufacture of the other brandsof aspirin that are on the market. In the acetylation of salicylic acid to makeaspirin, no water or moisture-aqueous moisture-ever comes in contact withthe Bayer product. Pharmacologists will tell you that aspirin is highly sensitive136 FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN to moisture and that moisture will quickly break it down to free salicylic acid and acetic acid which is irritating. Bayer control specifications show that all Bayer aspirin and Bayer aspirin tablets exceed U.S.P. requirements in at least 12 particulars described on the breakdown attached. By imposing very careful controls Bayer is able to produce a minimum of 20 million Bayer aspirin tablets a day and yet it is able to insure their uniformity, high quality, purity, and effectiveness. Doubtless, no other manufacturer at- tempts to maintain such close range specifications In order to provide you with current data actually comparing Bayer aspirin and other brands of aspirin, on January 21 we had our control personnel in Trenton make random purchases of 12 different brands of aspirin, including Bayer. These purchases were made in nine different retail outlets in the Trenton area. Routine analysis showed that the Bayer aspirin met- or exceeded all -U.S.P. standards and also met all of Bayer's own higher standards. Of the other 11 brands, 3 had 1 or more broken tablets, 2 had, 1 or more tablets spotted with grease, 3 had an acetic odor, 3 were off-white in color, only- 1 was enclosed in a carton with a separate direction dircular, 9 had no, outer carton; and 2 had either an illegible or no control number. Quite a part from this survey we know that Bayer aspirin is the only aspirin which reaches the consumer in a sealed carton. The fact that Bayer's carton is sealed and that detailed directions are enclosed is more important than It may seem at first. Besides making a pharmaceutically elegant package and providing precise and complete directions and other information conducive to proper and safe usage, this method of packaging serves to protect the product-from damage in-transit, from deterioration while held in -stock, and from tampering at any point in the channels of distribution. Other shortcomings in the 11 other brands of aspirin analyzed were these: One failed the U.S.P. minimum standard for weight variation, 3 barely passed the U.S.P. minimum for free salicylic acid and, of course, failed to meet the Bayer specifications, 4 did not meet the Bayer specifications for aspirin grainage, and 3 failed to meet the Bayer specification for disintegration time. Although these differences clearly suggest that further important differences would be found if further analysis and tests were conducted, I think the above is sufficient to demonstrate that while \"all aspirin is not the same,\" all Bayer aspirin is-and that this is important. In closing I would like to extend again to you, Senator, and to your staff as well as to the Special Committee on Aging, a standing invitation to visit our plant in Trenton and see for yourself the great care, skill, and experience that go into the manufacture of Bayer aspirin tablets. Just call or write to me and we shall surely be able to accommodate your-busy schedule. Respectfully yours, J. N. CooKE, Pre8ident.

McNAMARA, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR MCNAMARA: Dr. Robert E. Shank, chairman of the Committee onFood and Nutrition of the American Medical Association, recently testified beforeyour Special Committee on Aging. Unfortunately he listed the name of \"NaturalFood Associates\" in a group of organizations which he accuses of telling \"big lies\" to the American people.Would it be possible to have the enclosed letter introduced into the record of your committee hearings? Sincerely, JOE D. NICHOLS, M.D.National Pre8ident. Enclosure. ELLINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, Atlanta, Tes., February 16, 1963. Dr. ROBERT E. SHANK, Chairman, Council on Food8 and Nutrition, American Medical A8sociation, Chicago, Ill. DEAR DR. SHANK: In the January 26, 1963, issue of JAMA, you are quoted assaying \"the food fanatics are well organized.\" You have included Natural FoodAssociates in a group of organizations that you claim are spreading the fourmyths of nutrition. You infer that Natural Food Associates believes \"that alldiseases are due to faulty diet.\" This is not true and you have no right to makethis unwarranted charge against our organization. Twelve years ago I wrote\"A Concept of Totality\" in which I suggested there were six chief causes ofdisease: (1) emotional, (2) nutritional, (3) poisons, (4) infections, (5) acci-dents, and (6) inherited. The leadership of Natural Food Associates recognizesthe importance of all these, including allergy, as basic causes of disease. We do believe that soil depletion causes malnutrition. You have no validproof that this belief is a myth. The experiment done by the USDA at Ithaca,N.Y., was not scientifically planned and the results were misinterpreted. SirAlbert Howard proved the relationship of the fertility of soil to health more than40 years ago. The careful, scientific work of Dr. William A. Albrecht of theUniversity of Missouri, and the late Dr. E. E. Pfeiffer, showing the definite rela-tionship of soil fertility to the quality of the foods produced, cannot be denied.I am chairman of the public relations committee of our local county medicalsociety. It is my opinion that the unwarranted attacks being made by your com-mittee on Natural Food Associates and other dedicated, informed conserva-tionists, is dong great harm to the public relations of our profession. Millionsof Americans have lost confidence in the FDA, the Better Business Bureau, andthe AMA as a result of these baseless charges. The average American is more intelligent than you might think.The biochemist may not recognize the importance of proper nutrition in theprevention of metabolic disease. But the farmer, the veterinarian, dentists, andthousands of practicing physicians are quite sure that maltnutrition is a chief cause of an ever-increasing illness in this country.You are quoted as saying that we believe that commercial food processingdestroys the nutritive value of foods. And again you call this belief a myth.Have you ever compared the nutritional quality of enriched white bread to thatof bread made from freshly ground wheat which has not been bleached withchlorine dioxide? Did you know that the food processors are removing mostof the vitamins and minerals from. our cereals? The enrichment program isonly a very feeble effort which fails to restore many of the essential nutrients.Are you not familiar with what happens to the natural oils when they are refined and hydrogenated by the food processor?FRAUDS AND QUACKERY AFFECTING THE OLDER CITIZEN 139 And again you have said that we in Natural Food Associates believe that mostAmericans suffer from subclinical deficiencies and therefore need to supplement their diet with \"various concoctions.\" Did you know that 98.5 percent of Amer-icans have dental caries? Reliable authorities in the dental profession knowthat refined carbohydrates and malnutrition are the chief causes of dental caries.Dr. Ancel Keys, an authority on the subject, has said that \"among adults, inthe United States at least, the question is not wvho has atherosclerosis, but rather who has more and who has less.\" P. A. Boyer, in the JAMA 1959: 170, hassaid that atherosclerosis, the forerunner of coronary disease In 97 percent ofthe cases, is no longer a disease of the aged. And the Council on Food andNutrition in 1957 said \"improper nutrition as a basic cause of atherosclerosis has, in the past few years, been well established.\"I do not know what your definition of \"various concoctions\" might include.Natural Food Associates has never promoted food faddism or quackery. Onthe contrary, we are doing our utmost to educate our members so that theywill not fall victim to the quack or food faddist. We are teaching our membersthe values of natural, poison-free food grown on fertile soils. We believe thisis the proper way to get good nutrition. We are trying to encourage and teachfarmers how to grow poison-free food on fertile soils.Natural Food Associates is a conservation organization. We are trying to con- serve soil, water and human health and we are quite sure that they are inter-related. We are not trying to exploit either our members or the American people.After all natural, poison-free foods grown on fertile soils are actually the leastexpensive foods today. The most expensive foods are the commercial breakfastcereals. Did you know that 4 ounces of puffed rice now sells for 23 cents in thesupermarket? This is 92 cents a pound the consumer is paying for rice thathas had most of the vitamins and minerals removed. Your testimony before the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging on Jan-uary 15 will be challenged and vigorously opposed. I only wish that you couldhave met the leaders of Natural Fool Associates and could have been properlyinformed about our beliefs before you gave your testimony to the committee.We are not spreading \"big lies\" as you testified. I think you owe Natural FoodAssociates an apology for your unwarranted attack. I wish you could come to Atlanta and 'visit our NFA headquarters. I wouldlike to take you on a tour of my own farm and show you the results of our meth-ods. I would like for you to be my guest in my home. I have known Dr. Blasingame for many years. I believe he will vouch for my sincerity, and dedication to the high-principles of our profession. I served as councilor of the 15th district of the Texas Medical Association for 9 years. I have been president of the 1:5th District Medical Society of Texasand the Tri-State Medical Society. I am presently vice chairman of the Com-mittee on Nutrition of the Texas Medical Association. Sincerely yours, JOE D. NICHOLS, M.D. (Whereupon, at 12:10 p.m., the committee recessed to reconvene at 10 a.m., Wednesday, January 16,1963.) 0 "}
