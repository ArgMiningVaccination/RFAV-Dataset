She brings to the table more than 35 years of experience in the canadian health care system, first as a front-line nurse, a nurse manager and executive and, for the last 15 years, as the president and chief executive officer of various organizations. Q: What's first, now that you're cEo of Ahs?A: My first job is learning the landscape. i need to connect with the front line. when i think about what a ceo should be doing, my primary job should be to eliminate any barriers front-line staff may have or feel. i also need to have a relationship with the community at large; to say to albertans: 'if you have issues or concerns, let us know. t ell us and we're going to do our best to meet your needs and expectations.' Q: What type of changes are you envisioning?A: i'll be looking at how we maintain quality of care and maintain appropriate wait times. how do we make sure we're serving the right person, at the right time, doing the right thing? what kinds of structures do staff need to help them move through that? Q: many would say there have been incidences of political interference in the past when it comes to your position. how do you plan to handle the politics of Alberta? A: politics and health care go together. we elect our political leaders, give them tax dollars and tell them they need to spend it in the areas important to us. health care has always been, and will always be, one of the most important areas to canadians. as long as we're funded by tax dollars, you as a taxpayer will have your say through the politician. when we see an increase in the politicization of decisions, it's because there is a loss of confidence. My job is to bring confidence to the position and to the organization, and to earn the confidence of albertans. if we have that kind of a relationship with the people of alberta and with the staff of ahS and with the physicians, i think we'll be on the right path. n KAMINSKIl o C a l l e a d e r s PAGE 2 There are plenty of health care options available.

Medication reconciliation - Med rec - is a process by which health care providers work with you and your family to ensure medication information is consistent and accurate no matter where you receive care. one of the best ways to do this is by keeping an up-to-date list of all the medications you take. this list is important in helping make sure you get the right medication at the right time, no matter where you are receiving treatment. at alberta health Services, our health care providers want to work with you to ensure your medication list is complete, accurate and up to date. having this list and sharing it every time you see your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or other health care provider helps them give you the best care possible. people often assume their health care providers have access to a list of their medications, but due to the variety of sources medications come from, this isn't always the case. and medications are more than just those prescribed to you by a doctor. y our list should also include over-the-counter medications including pain killers, cold medicines, laxatives, vitamins, natural and herbal remedies, as well as recreational drugs, patches, inhalers, drops, creams - and even samples a doctor has given you. without you sharing everything you know about what you're taking and how you take it, something could be missed - like a medication that is very important to you staying healthy, or that one medication may not work well with another. there are many ways you can keep track of the medications you take, from a list in your wallet or purse, to something you keep on your mobile device. Some of these tools are available on the ahS website, along with more information on Med rec. go to: www. albertahealthservices.ca/medlist. n DR. f Rancois belange RloRi anDeRson your m Ed list is kEy to your c ArEcalgary Zone executive leadership team Medical student Ann Zalucky, study participant Arlene MacCallum, and nephrologist and principal investigator Dr. Sofia Ahmed, from left, are part of a study investigating how weight distribution may affect kidney function.when calgarian arlene Maccallum heard about a new research study that's trying to determine the impact of weight and body shape on kidney function, she didn't have to think very long before signing up. \"My father had kidney disease and died at quite a young age, and my husband is a kidney transplant recipient,\" she says. \"it just seemed natural that i would get involved in something like this that might shed more light on how kidney disease develops.\" over the years, scientists have drawn links between obesity and sleep apnea, and sleep apnea and deteriorating kidney function. now researchers with alberta health Services (ahS) and the university of calgary are investigating whether excess weight alone has a harmful effect on the kidneys. \"Diabetes and high blood pressure are two of the biggest risk factors for kidney damage, but a growing body of research suggests that how weight is distributed may affect kidney function,\" says Dr. Sofia ahmed, an ahS nephrologist and principal investigator in the study. \"anything that creates extra wear and tear on the kidneys can contribute to a loss in function, in the same way that a car that's driven hard over time can't continue to perform at the same high level. in our study, we hope to learn more about what the relationship may be between increased weight and how it is distributed - such as apple or pear body shapes - and kidney function.\" in particular, researchers will be looking at a hormonal system called the renin-angiotensin system and whether extra weight has an impact on it and, in turn, how hard the kidneys have to work to keep a person's blood clean. individuals interested in taking part in the study will first have a screening history taken and then a physical exam. \"we're looking for people who are generally in good health and who don't have any underlying health conditions, such as diabetes,\" says ann Zalucky, a medical student who is helping lead the study as part of her MD/MSc degree in the university of calgary's leaders in Medicine program. \"w e're interested in all sorts of body compositions and sizes.\" one stipulation is that participants must not have sleep apnea. if eligible, participants will be asked to come in for one study visit that lasts about three hours. During the study visit, blood will be drawn and various physiological measures taken. the study is funded by alberta innovates - health Solutions. ahmed is also a member of the libin cardiovascular institute of alberta. anyone interested in taking part in the study should call 403.210.7434 or email dsola@ucalgary.ca. n Mosquitoescan't bite you if they can't find you.Some mosquitoes carry the West Nile virus, so it's best to avoid being bitten at all.

So she went to see her family physician. \"i hadn't been feeling well for over a month, then suddenly my condition got worse,\" says the 46-year-old calgary mother of three. \"it got so bad i couldn't walk the next day and was in severe pain.\" taylor was able to see a gastrointestinal (gi) specialist within a week. her family physician was also able to consult a gi specialist over the phone and, on their advice, immediately put her on medication to help manage her crohn's - a type of inflammatory bowel disease - and the swelling. \"with the medication, i felt better right away. i got in to see a specialist for a colonoscopy and ultrasound in a matter of days,\" she says. \"t en or 15 years ago, i would have just had to wait and suffer, with months of tests.\" urgent patients like t aylor are now able to see a gi specialist in half the time compared to a year ago, thanks to centralized access t riage (cat), a single source for referrals to gi specialists now used by alberta health Services (ahS) calgary Zone, which helps track and process patients who need care soonest. calgary is one of the first cities in canada to use this type of system for gi referrals. the sickest and most urgent patients now typically wait less than five weeks to see a gi specialist, compared to more than nine weeks a year ago. patients considered emergent - including those with active gastrointestinal bleed, severe crohn's disease or difficulty swallowing, are now seen within one to two weeks, compared to 4.4 weeks a year ago. \"this system allows us to focus our attention on the sickest patients by evaluating them based on level of urgency,\" says Dr. Mark Swain, clinical Section chief of gastroenterology with ahS calgary Zone. \"this makes a huge difference in that patients have a better, faster and shorter path to the best quality care and treatment.\" each month, cat receives about 1,200 referrals for gi specialists. w ait times for these most urgent patients are now in line with national guidelines established by the canadian association of gastroenterology. Swain says the cat process helps balance demand and resources to address patient needs in real time. \"these are patients with potentially life-threatening conditions. at least six per cent of these most urgent patients have cancer,\" Swain explains. \"cat is a transparent system that allows patients to access a specialist in the most timely manner possible. plus, it required no new investment, so it means more value for dollars.\" traditionally, referrals come from family physicians to specific specialists. now, cat puts referrals into a pool of physicians. these referrals are triaged on the basis of need and urgency, and patients are sent to the first available physician. Swain says a number of other strategies are being put in place to manage wait times for less urgent patients, including having nurse navigators manage moderate and routine patients. for t aylor, it means feeling better, sooner. \"it' s great to be able to get in to see a specialist quickly,\" she says. \" when you're that ill, you need care as quickly as possible. that's exactly what happened.\" nn WhA t is A Gi sPEciAlist? a gi specialist is a doctor who specializes in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. this may include conditions that affect the stomach, esophagus, liver, gallbladder, small intestine, colon, pancreas and rectum. people generally see a gi specialist for reasons that include a recurring upset stomach, indigestion, ongoing diarrhea, constipation or rectal bleeding. generally, when a visit to a gi specialist is required, the symptoms have begun to interfere with normal daily activities. people are usually referred to a gi specialist by a family physician or other primary health care provider. n WhA t is crohn's disEAsE? crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that occurs when parts of the digestive system get swollen and have deep sores called ulcers. crohn's disease usually is found in the last part of the small intestine and the first part of the large intestine, but can develop anywhere in the digestive tract. n WhA t cAusEs crohn's disEAsE? Doctors don't know what causes crohn's disease. y ou may get it when the body's immune system has an abnormal response to normal bacteria in your intestine. other kinds of bacteria and viruses may also play a role in causing the disease. crohn's disease can run in families. Smoking also puts you at a higher risk. n WhA t ArE thE symPtoms? the main symptoms of crohn's disease are belly pain and diarrhea (sometimes with blood). losing weight without trying is another common sign. less common symptoms include mouth sores, bowel blockages, and anal tears - also called fissures. n hoW is it trEA tEd? treatment depends on the type of symptoms you have and how bad they are. exercise, eating healthy meals and, when necessary, prescription medication can be very effective. crohn's disease makes it hard for your body to absorb nutrients from food. a meal plan that focuses on high-calorie, high-protein foods can help you get the nutrients you need. - With files from MyHealthAlberta new SySteMiS the cat'SMeow Thanks to Centralized Access Triage (CAT), patients needing urgent gastrointestinal care are fast-tracked Story and photo by Colin Zak | \" when you're that ill, you neeD care aS quickly aS poSSible. that'S exactly what happeneD - Mary Taylor, Crohn's disease patientfAst f ActsService S in your co MMunity mEnt Al hEAlth hElP linE you're not alone. if you need to talk, call the alberta health Services Mental health help line. get confidential, anonymous service, crisis intervention, information about mental health programs and services, and referrals to other agencies and help if you need it. call 1.877.303.2642. trAvEl hEAlth sErvicEs before you travel outside of canada, contact ahS travel health Services for information about the possible risk of communicable diseases when travelling and ways to prevent them. you can also get your travel immunizations. book your appointment at least two to three months before you leave. for the location nearest you, call health link alberta at 403.943.5465. childbirth And P ArEntinG alberta health Services, calgary Zone, offers 30 different courses for expectant and new families. topics include pregnancy, childbirth, growth and development, and mom's health. go to www.birthandbabies.com and click on \"Class Calendar \" to find courses. brEAst cAncEr scrEEninG Screen t est provides screening mammograms at two fixed location clinics, one in calgary and one in edmonton.

Seniors with complex health needs can be served in comprehensive adult day programs, which offer medical monitoring and treatment, medication assistance, rehabilitation, transportation and in-home personal care. \"we're really proud of the work we've done in the community. Seniors involved the program come in several days a week and join other seniors in the community to do activities, exercise, socialize and events, and just have a lot of fun,\" says barb noad, agecare's marketing and communications manager. \"one of the things we see when seniors are living at home is that sometimes they can get a feeling of isolation being on their own and this is a way for them to connect with their peers.\" cheryl knight, executive Director of Seniors health for ahS, says adult day programs are an integral part of ahS' seniors strategy. \"by getting seniors out of their homes once or twice a week, we're helping them stay in their homes longer and providing caregivers with a needed break to ensure they can stay well while continuing in their caregiving role,\" knight says. as an added bonus, seniors in the adult day programs are monitored by health professionals who may be able to identify and treat medical issues before they become serious - potentially so serious that seniors would be unable to remain at home. philo's daughter, janice, certainly appreciates the break the program gives her, as well as the peace of mind. \"for us as a family it's been a great program because it allows us to not have to worry about mom for two days a week, wondering what she's doing or that she's not interacting with people. it's really relieved stress for us as caregivers,\" janice says. to see if you or a loved one could benefit from an adult day program in calgary Zone, please contact 403.943.1920. nStory by James Stevenson and Amber Goulard | Calgarian Noreen Philo enjoys the social activities she gets by attending an adult day program.aDult Day prograMS are expanDingMore than 500 new spaces to be added for seniors \" the Main thing iS we enjoy Seeing each other anD converSing - Adult day program participant Noreen Philo, 86 H e a l t H C a r e H e r o e s PAGE 5 For the latest health news updates in your zone, visit the AHS website. www.albertahealthservices.caMaria Storkova was eight years old when she experienced some pain in her ankles when she was out hiking. a year later, her older sister, Magdalena, encountered some difficulties playing piano. \"i had a piano exam that i needed to practise for, but i couldn't because my hands were bothering me,\" Magdalena says. the two sisters, now 11 and 14, are among the roughly 350 patients with pediatric arthritis who are seen each year at alberta children's hospital in calgary. today, the girls have their condition well under control and are back hiking and making music. they are also taking part in an international research study that's trying to find out if there are genetic markers that might one day let doctors come up with a test to determine which medications will be the best for each patient. \"currently, there is no way of knowing how individual children will respond to medication,\" says alberta health Services pediatric rheumatologist Dr. heinrike Schmeling, who is leading the study. \"what we need is a way of determining in advance what the safest and most effective treatment will be for each child.\" the illness can be well controlled with the medications now available, once doctors determine which will be the most effective and have the fewest side effects for the patient. it's a trial-and-error process that can sometimes take up to a year. Speed is of the essence in treating arthritis; the earlier it can be brought under control, the better the long-term prospects. if it goes untreated too long, it can damage bone and cartilage, and affect a child's growth. although there is no cure, it can go into remission for long periods. arthritis is often thought of as an ailment of the elderly, but it's the most common autoimmune disorder in children. it's estimated about one in 1,000 children will develop pediatric arthritis. Swollen joints are the most common symptom seen in children, but there are sometimes more serious complications such as inflammation of the heart, eyes and other organs. in the study, researchers are analyzing saliva samples in children with arthritis to try to find genetic markers that might predict response to medication. in calgary, researchers are hoping to recruit about 300 children to the study. Schmeling established the first early childhood arthritis program in canada. her research project includes sites in germany, t oronto and calgary. it is supported by the alberta children's hospital foundation, the ach research institute for child and Maternal health, the Mccaig institute for bone and joint health, the canadian arthritis network and the canadian institutes of health research. for more information on participating in the study, contact research co-ordinator Dwaraka veeramreddy at 403.955.3194 or dwaraka. veeramreddy@albertahealthservices.ca. nStory by Greg Harris | Photo by Paul Rotzingeryoung arthritiS patientS May get tailor-MaDe MeDS Study to see if genetic markers can lead to most effective treatments Bein g Super { } To Issac, being healthy means... www.albertahealthservices.ca/yourvoice #yourvoiceWhat does health mean to you?

Robotics on the brain calgary neurosurgeon Dr. garnette Sutherland has spent his career breaking new ground in neurosurgery. his first \"world first\" was a magnetic resonance imaging (Mri) system for operating rooms. it provides surgeons with 3-D images during an operation. he followed that with another milestone: the neuroarm, the world's first Mri-compatible surgical robot for both microsurgery and image-guided biopsy. Surgeons control the neuroarm from a workstation, guiding its movements via images on a screen. because it can move in smaller increments than the human hand, neuroarm is the ideal tool for performing delicate surgery inside the brain. 4. 10. 5.from heart attacks to colds, genetics to food science, researchers in Alberta are discovering new treatments and developing new technologies to improve the health of Albertans and people around the world. Take a look at 10 groundbreaking innovations developed in our province. Story by Connie Bryson | For more innovations, visit applemag.ca Groundbreaking drug for hep B the first oral medicine to treat chronic hepatitis b infection was developed by Dr. lorne tyrrell at the university of alberta. lamivudine is a groundbreaking drug for patients with this chronic viral infection - about 300 to 350 million people worldwide. these people cannot clear the virus from their body; they are at high risk of serious liver damage, as well as death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. lamivudine stops the virus from replicating, which minimizes liver damage. alberta: hotbeD of innovationS Keeping a steady beat cardiologist Dr. anne gillis is an international leader in the use of devices like pacemakers to treat heart rhythm disorders. under her leadership, calgary's cardiac arrhythmia Service became the first centre outside the u.S. to evaluate remote monitoring of patients with implantable defibrillators. her research has led to refinements in pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, improving the quality of life for countless heart patients. 2.Food safety first in 2008, deli meats contaminated with the listeria bacteria led to 22 deaths in canada. thanks to research by three university of alberta scientists - Drs. lynn McMullen, Michael Stiles and john vederas - there's a life-saving food additive that kills this deadly bacteria without any chemicals. their Micocin technology is now used by food- packaging companies to ensure the safety of food products.6. 8.Getting a good night's sleep Sleep apnea is a life-threatening condition that interrupts breathing during sleep. the university of calgary's Dr. john remmers was the first to demonstrate that the condition is due to a narrowing of part of the throat. he developed a device to keep the airway open during sleep: the cpap (continuous positive airway pressure) device. the cpap essentially eliminates sleep apnea and dramatically improves sleep quality. 9.Dressing for success with his invention of the acticoat technology, Dr. robert burrell revolutionized wound care and helped save the lives and limbs of thousands of patients around the world. w orking as a biomedical engineer at alberta's w estaim t echnologies inc., burrell developed tiny silver nanocrystals that kill microbes and stop inflammation. acticoat dressings are used worldwide to prevent life-threatening infections and promote healing in burns, ulcers and other wounds. Rules change for heart transplants heart transplants in babies are different from those in adults, thanks to research by cardiologist Dr. lori w est. She discovered that infants can receive a heart from a donor with an incompatible blood type; in adults, donor and recipient blood types must match. because infant immune systems can adapt to a mismatched donor, this widens the pool of potential organs and decreases wait times. Creating a lab in a box an alberta company is turning the notion of a lab test on its head. instead of a lab that requires floor space and equipment, aquila Diagnostics Systems inc. has developed a device the size of a toaster that can do all kinds of molecular tests - determine whether a patient is resistant to cancer drugs, identify a strain of malaria, pinpoint infectious disease in a herd of cattle, and more. the science behind the technology comes from the work of university of alberta cancer researcher Dr. linda pilarski. the device has the potential to replace millions of dollars of equipment in a conventional lab with something that is much less expensive and can be used anywhere.Gene-mapping workhorse a tool developed at the university of alberta in the 1990s became the workhorse of the human genome project - an international research effort to map all of our genes, which paves the way for new understanding of genetic factors in disease. Developed by analytical chemists Drs. norman Dovichi and jianzhong Zhang, the instrument analyzed Dna 10 times faster than earlier technology. Nothing to sneeze at one of canada's most popular over-the-counter cold and flu medicines was developed in alberta. cold-fx came out of research at the university of alberta on the active ingredients in traditional herbal medicine. it's derived from the roots of the ginseng plant, one of the most valued medicinal plants in the world.when 61-year-old high school teacher Scott forbes learned he had incurable Stage 4 colon cancer in april 2011, he buckled down with a 'can-do' attitude and faced his impending treatment full on. \"it's really just the power of positive thinking to get through this,\" says forbes. \"one of the best things going for me is that i've been able to have the majority of my treatment in high river where i live.\" the high river community cancer centre is a small treatment room at the high river general hospital where forbes has been treated since his diagnosis. at almost 400 sq.-ft., it can accommodate five patients and pumps at a time, approximately 120 procedures a month. and although flooding a year ago resulted in the evacuation of the hospital which was damaged by the rising water, there is a silver lining, and that is the cancer centre is about to expand. flood renovations will see the walls knocked down between this area and a number of former offices to expand the space to accommodate approximately double the number of patients and procedures. while patients must still visit the tom baker cancer centre in calgary for oncologist care to develop their treatment plan, they can have the actual cancer treatment in high river. the cancer centre will serve patients in an area ranging from south calgary to claresholm and from eden valley in the east to lamond in the west.\"with the exception of radiation, we follow our patients' full treatment plan from the moment they walk in the door - for instance, chemotherapy, symptom management, transfusions, monitoring blood levels, follow-up visits and intravenous fluids,\" says kim lush, cancer clinic charge nurse at the hospital. the benefits of having such care closer to home are many. besides offering free parking, less driving and gas consumption and less time off work, the clinic offers emotional support. \"for me, the personal touch at the centre is priceless,\" says forbes. \"i've always felt great vibes from a really caring group of staff, and i've made friends with other people with cancer in an informal support system at the clinic. and the coffee is always on. \"i know i'll have to go through more treatment, but i have no doubt the new cancer centre will still have the old-style camaraderie that it's known for - and i'm grateful for that.\" funded jointly through the high river District health care foundation and the rotary club of high river, the campaign has already raised more than $525,000 since May 2013 toward its goal of $1 million by 2015. both Michael brown, executive Director of the foundation, and harry riva cambrin, president of the rotary club in high river, are touched by the support from the community. \"it's comforting to see some good fortune come out of the distressing time during the flood and work positively toward much-needed health care services in our area,\" brown says. riva cambrin agrees. \"cancer treatment is a commitment of a lot of time - from family, friends and employers,\" he says. \"it's nice to be part of this great initiative.\" for more information, please visit www. highriverhealthfoundation.ca. no u r p a r t n e r s PAGE 7 Make a difference in your community.

Inset: Scott Forbes. as the wife of a two-time cancer survivor, lorelee Marin says she rededicated her life to preventing cancer the day her husband henry was first diagnosed with leukemia in 1999. \"My passion for cancer prevention and screening began that day 16 years ago,\" says lloydminster resident Marin. \"t oday, it has grown to include the development of healthy public policy and environments that support healthy living and reducing risk of cancer, and improving access to services and supports in rural alberta.\" to that aim, Marin became a member of the provincial advisory council (pac) on cancer. it consists of eight volunteer members who bring first-hand perspectives to alberta health Services (ahS) cancer care services across alberta. \"we need to build awareness around the prevention of cancer,\" says Marin. \"w e need to empower albertans to make choices that reduce their risk of cancer.\" and empowering albertans to make the right choices is the goal of a new ahS campaign that aims to reduce the risk of cancer in the province by up to 50 per cent. \"we want to inform albertans about accessible and achievable lifestyle choices that can reduce their cancer risk,\" says Dr. laura McDougall, Medical and Scientific Director, alberta cancer prevention legacy fund, ahS. \"we felt the most effective way to do this would be to create a new website that acts as a one-stop shop for information on all the preventative clinical supports and programs already offered throughout the province.\" the new website, www.albertaprevents cancer.ca, is funded through alberta's cancer prevention legacy fund (acplf), and was developed through research and consultation with the public and the pac on cancer. \"an effective public health campaign needs strong community support,\" says McDougall. \"by having the pac on cancer available to test-market things at an earlier stage, we were able to incorporate valuable public perspectives into our approach and messaging.\" the campaign asks albertans to consider what they would do with their lives and loved ones if they had more time together. \"i really want the campaign and the website to be successful. i told acplf that it needs to be encouraging and engaging so that each of us has the ability to make a difference in our lives and those around us, and i think they got that,\" says Marin. \"i am privileged to serve albertans as a council member on the provincial advisory council on cancer and as a core committee member for the Strategic clinical network on cancer.\" for more information on the pac on cancer, visit www.albertahealthservices.ca/4312.asp. ncancer caMpaign pacs powerful MeSSage Story by Kristin Bernhard | we neeD to eMpower albertanS to Make choiceS that reDuce their riSk of cancer - Lorelee Marin, member of the Provincial Advisory Council on Cancer and wife of a two-time cancer survivorhere' S how to reach u SZonE kit poole kit.poole@albertahealthservices.ca imAGinG: Michael brownZone News - calgary Zone is published monthly by alberta health Services to inform albertans of the programs and services available to them, and of the work being done to improve the health care system in their communities. to see calgary's Zone News online, visit www.albertahealthservices.ca/5826.aspi n b r i e f PAGE 8 www.albertahealthservices.ca Be sure to visit our website for health advisories around the province.loc Al lEAdErshi PcAlGAry Zone AHS embraces local leadership and zone-based decision-making.
