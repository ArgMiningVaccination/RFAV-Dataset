A bath is always a great form of self-care and meditation but adding certain ingredients into the water adds more to your overall health and experience. I will explain the purpose of each ingredient below. Enjoy! And send us an email to let us know what you think of this product because there are more coming soon! ** Please note that this product is not for consumption and not for children** All Natural Ingredients: Pink Himalayan Sea Salt\u2014 when this type of salt is energetically concentrated like this and then absorbed into bath water it matches the trace minerals found in the human body. Therefore it is easily absorbed by the cells in your body and quickly gets to work. This salt is known for aiding in healing join pain, cracked or damaged skin, minor cuts and wounds, and sore muscles. It also is known to boost the libido and encourage better, more restful sleep. Epsom Salt/ Magnesium Sulfate \u2014 I could rave about the benefits of epsom salt baths all day long but I'll try and keep it short. Most humans today suffer from magnesium deficiency and aren't even aware of this very important chemical element. If you are magnesium deficient you may suffer from headaches, swollen/sore joint pain, fatigue, muscle cramps, insomnia and anxiety just to name a few. In order to combat these symptoms we need to be taking in this element daily and through absorption is a great and efficient way. I plan to do a whole blog soon on how beneficial epsom salt has been to me personally. Dried Red Rose Petals \u2014 in witchcraft, red rose petals are used to attract love, balance the emotions, and ignite passion in your spell work. Taking a bath in them also is said to have the same effect on the psyche. For the bath mix purpose they simply just look beautiful Rosemary\u2014 rosemary being one of the baddies in witchcraft practices has many benefits both spiritually and nutritionally. Since this mix is not for consumption I will concentrate on the spiritual explanation: love, protection, lust, healing and banishing. Feel like someone put an evil eye on you? You better have Miss Rosemary with you on the daily! Lemon Essential Oil\u2014 skin brightening, reduces dandruff, treats acne, clears pores and blackheads, conditions and purifies the skin. Orange Essential Oil \u2014 mood-lifting, anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial. Lavender Essential oil \u2014 helps to reduce redness in the skin, powerfully calming and anxiety reducing, promotes sleep, and has anti-aging properties as well. Pinch of Baking Soda \u2014 neutralizes the PH levels in the bath water allowing all the other ingredients to be used to their full potential without harmful metals getting in the way\u2014 if you have additional baking soda at home it's always good to mix it in the bath water before applying any other ingredient. It also is great for treating rashes and burns. "}
