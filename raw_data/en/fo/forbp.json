Some people may not feel comfortable using the word until after treatment ends. Others may prefer to use different words. You and your child may each have different feelings about using the word. The different opinions and feelings people have about using the term \"survivor\" are all valid. You may encounter the term used in different ways. Welcome Having a child diagnosed with cancer is like being sent on a journey that no parent wants to take. You are forced to go to places you did not want to go to, learn a language you never planned on learning, and do things you never wanted to do. \"In cancer, survivorship focuses on the health and well-being of a person with cancer from the time of diagnosis until the end of life. This includes the physical, mental, emotional, social, and financial effects of cancer that begin at diagnosis and continue through treatment and beyond. The survivorship experience also includes issues related to follow-up care (including regular health and wellness checkups), late effects of treatment, cancer recurrence, second cancers, and quality of life. Family members, friends, and caregivers are also considered part of the survivorship experience.\" - The National Cancer Institute (NCI), www.cancer.govSURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 2You and your child will have questions and concerns along the way. Navigating this foreign landscape and coping with the unpredictable demands of day-to-day life that come with the territory can be overwhelming. Remember you are not alone. The support of loved ones and organizations, such as The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), can help you and your family to navigate new pathways and help you find your \"new normal.\" Whether you are a parent, foster parent, adult sibling, grandparent or other legal guardian, this workbook is useful to anybody who is caring for a child with cancer. How to Use the Workbook Use this workbook to collect important information as your child moves through diagnosis and treatment into post- treatment survivorship care. Take this workbook with you to your child's appointments. Fill out the worksheets with help from members of your child's healthcare team, as needed.

Because your child has a history of cancer, they will need lifelong follow-up care. Therefore, it is very important that your child always maintains health insurance, even into adulthood. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires plans that cover dependent children to make the coverage available until the child reaches the age of 26. Both married and unmarried children qualify for this coverage.

However, some treatments may cause significant long-term and/or late effects. Follow-up medical care to monitor survivors for possible long-term and/or late effects is important. Discuss the possible effects of your child's treatment with the members of the healthcare team in order to plan treatment and follow-up care. Factors that determine the risk of long-term and/or late effects include: Type of treatment o For example, the specific drugs used or the part of the body treated with radiation Length of treatment Your child's age at the time of treatment Your child's sex Overall health \"Long-term effects\" of cancer therapy are medical problems that last for months or years after treatment ends. Fertility (the ability to become pregnant or father a child) problems and treatment-related fatigue are examples of long-term effects. \"Late effects\" are medical problems that may appear after treatment ends, even years later. Treatment-related cancer and heart disease are examples of late effects. Long-term and late effects for survivors of blood cancers may include: Cognitive effects (effects on thinking, learning and memory) Keep a record of any cognitive (thinking), physical and/or emotional signs and/or symptoms that your child experiences and discuss them with the healthcare team.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 28 Physical effects Psychological effects Cognitive Effects Learning difficulties can begin either during treatment or may become evident months or even years after treatment. Math, problem solving, attention span, reading and spelling, processing of information, planning and organizing, and concentration skills are all areas of learning that may be affected. Childhood leukemia and lymphoma patients may receive therapy that affects the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS includes the brain and spinal cord. Therapies that affect the CNS, such as high-dose chemotherapy or radiation to the brain, increase the risk for cognitive effects including education issues. Talk to your child's healthcare team about any educational or learning issues that cause concern. See School and Long-Term and Late Effects on page 33 for more information. Physical Effects Depending on the type and duration of treatment, age and overall health, childhood cancer patients may be at risk for: Fatigue Neuropathy (nerve damage) Heart disease Thyroid problemsVisit www.LLS.org/booklets (filter by Side Effect Management) to view Side-Effect Management: Effects of Childhood Cancer Treatment on Learning.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 29 Organ damage (lungs, kidneys) Bone issues, such as osteoporosis Secondary cancer Early or delayed puberty Fertility problems Other conditions Fertility Preservation \"Fertility\" describes the ability to conceive a biological child. Some cancer treatments affect fertility in males and females. The risk of infertility is based on several factors including the type of treatment received, the duration or dosage of treatment and the patient's age at the start of treatment. There are options to preserve fertility. Some of these options require that action be taken before treatment begins. As much as possible, your child should be involved in the discussion about how cancer treatment may affect their ability to have children in the future. Members of the healthcare team and a child-life specialist can provide age-appropriate ways to explain and talk about these issues with your child. Options to preserve fertility depend on several factors. If patients need treatment immediately, there may not be time to complete fertility preservation. If your child has reached puberty, and time allows, sperm banking or egg freezing may be an option. If a child has not reached puberty, and time allows, testicular or ovarian tissue freezing may be an option. o For some types of cancer, the doctor may advise against tissue freezing because of a concern that transplanted tissue could carry cancer cells back into the body.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 30Fertility Preservation Information Provide details of any fertility preservation procedures so that your child can reference them in the future. Procedure Date Hospital or Clinic Phone Number Remember, there are many ways to build a family, whether through natural conception, using assisted reproductive technology, or adoption. Once your child is an adult and ready to start a family, they should consider and discuss all options. Psychological Effects Some children may experience long-term psychological effects after treatment. Diagnosing your child may be tempting, but your best resource will be a trained mental health professional. The following lists some symptoms of common mental health diagnoses. If your child experiences any of these, speak to a mental health professional. Depression or symptoms of depression o Symptoms of depression include ongoing sad moods, loss of interest in activities and/or irritability. Physical signs and/or symptoms are often common, such as changes in sleep and/or eating habits and fatigue. Even children who do not meet the full criteria for depressive disorder may still benefit from therapy with a mental health professional. To learn more about the process of fertility, visit www.LLS.org/YoungAdults or visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Fertility and Cancer.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 31 Anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or panic disorder o Anxiety disorders are different from the common worries encountered in day-to-day life. Symptoms of an anxiety disorder can include intrusive thoughts and make it difficult to pull away from a persistent anxious state of mind. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) o Post-traumatic stress disorder can develop in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary or dangerous event (such as being diagnosed with cancer). Symptoms can include anxiety, nightmares, irritability, changes in mood, and frightening and/or intrusive thoughts. Some things may trigger these feelings, such as going to the hospital or foods that were eaten often during treatment. Mental health is very important to your child's overall health and well-being. Ask the pediatrician or health insurance provider for a referral to a mental health professional. For more information, see Mental Health on page 45. Screening Recommendations To help understand and manage your child's risk of long-term and late effects, talk to your child's healthcare team. You will need to know the possible side effects of your child's specific treatments. For each possible side effect, ask the healthcare Visit www.LLS.org/FamilyWorkbook to find additional information about long-term and late effects in the chapter Beyond Treatment. Visit www.LLS.org/HealthManager to download LLS Health Manager. This free mobile app allows you to track your child's side effects, medication, food and hydration, and more. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 32team for screening recommendations, including the specific type of test your child will need to screen for a particular side effect; when your child should start screening; how often your child should be screened; and which healthcare provider will be responsible for the screening. Ask your child's healthcare team for a printout of screening recommendations and keep a copy in this workbook. The Children's Oncology Group The Children's Oncology Group (COG) provides recommendations for monitoring late effects in the resource Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent and Young Adult Cancers. The information is reviewed and updated regularly by experts in survivorship care. The guidelines are written for healthcare professionals; therefore, it is best to review the guidelines with the help of your child's healthcare team. The \"Health Links\" documents provided with the guidelines are written for patients and their families. As you read through these resources, write down any questions you want to address with members of your child's healthcare team. Visit www.survivorshipguidelines.org to download the guidelines and Health Links. Passport for Care\u00ae with the Children's Oncology Group is a website where clinicians can enter details about the specific cancer treatments that a patient received to generate a summary of risks for late effects and recommendations for screening, as well as follow-up care to manage risks. This information can be shared with other care providers, including primary and specialty care providers. Ask members of the healthcare team for a printout of your child's survivorship summary. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 33Passport for Care\u00ae also offers a Screening Recommendations Generator that can be used by survivors or caregivers to receive information on the potential late effects associated with treatments, the recommended follow-up screenings, and more. Visit www.passportforcare.org for more information. School and Long-Term and Late Effects Going to school is a big part of feeling normal for children and adolescents, but going back to school after cancer treatment can also bring new challenges for your child and your family. It is important to identify the areas of learning where your child may struggle. Then you can work together with the healthcare team, teachers and school staff to provide support and resources to help your child be successful in school. Neuropsychological Testing. Children who are at risk for cognitive effects (See Cognitive Effects on page 28) or who are having difficulty in school may benefit from neuropsychological testing done by a licensed pediatric neuropsychologist (an expert in the way the brain works) to check for possible learning challenges. Discuss the need for neuropsychological testing with members of your child's healthcare team, who can refer you to a pediatric neuropsychologist. School Psychological Assessment. Neuropsychological testing is often not covered by insurance and can be expensive. A school-based assessment may be an option (or may be a requirement of the school) to help determine your child's educational needs. These assessments are usually performed to determine if your child is eligible for special education programs. Generally, school-based assessments are less effective than neuropsychological testing at linking cancer treatment with learning or behavior problems. Ask your child's school administrators for more information. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 34Meeting Your Child's Educational Needs. With the help of the healthcare team, inform teachers and school staff about your child's educational needs before they return to school. Work together with the healthcare team, teachers and school staff to develop a program tailored to your child's specific needs. The program may include: Special accommodations\u2014 accommodations can be made to meet a child's educational needs, such as allowing for additional time to complete classwork or take exams. Children may qualify for special help under federal laws. Long-term planning\u2014plans can be developed to help a child through school transitions from middle school to high school and into adult life. Cognitive behavioral therapy\u2014certain cognitive therapies can help children develop strategies to address learning problems. For example, one strategy may be breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks. Laws That Protect Children's Educational Needs. The following three federal laws help protect the rights of students with disabilities, including those with educational needs resulting from cancer treatment: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) o Under IDEA, public school children with disabilities may receive an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) that outlines a formal plan to accommodate a child's individual needs. Keep a copy of any educational plan created for your child in this workbook.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 35 The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 - Section 504 o The act requires all educational institutions receiving federal funding to provide accommodations (adaptations) for students with physical or mental impairment, or a record of impairment, that limits one or more major life activities.

Healthy lifestyle habits can help your child recover faster and decrease the risk of future disease, such as other cancers, heart disease and diabetes. Making changes so that your child (and family) can be healthier can also help you gain a sense of control throughout survivorship. Many things may be out of your control, but you can teach your child to take good care of themselves. My child eats a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, proteins, whole grains and healthy fats. o Visit www.LLS.org/FamilyWorkbook and view the Nutrition chapter to find tips to help your child eat a healthy menu. My child drinks at least eight 8-oz glasses of water or liquids (not including caffeinated drinks or drinks with added sugars) each day. My child sleeps well each night and wakes up feeling rested. o Children aged 1 to 2 years need 11 to 14 hours of sleep (including naps), children aged 3 to 5 years need 10 to 13 hours of sleep (including naps), children aged 6 to 12 years need 9 to 12 hours of sleep, and teens need 8 to 10 hours of sleep per day.Check all of the healthy behavior statements that are true for your child.PearlPoint Nutrition Services\u00ae.

I have spoken to my child about the risks of smoking and tobacco use. I have spoken to my child about the risk of alcohol use. I have spoken to my child about safe sex, consent and the risk of unsafe sexual practices. My child avoids direct sun, when possible, and wears a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher and reapplies every 2 hours. I keep up with my child's medical needs, such as annual checkups with their pediatrician and getting regular dental cleanings. I keep my child's hematologist-oncologist informed about any changes in my child's well-being. I give my child all medications as prescribed by the healthcare team. I talk to my child's healthcare team about my child's mental health. My child connects with other children their age regularly. o Isolation is a risk factor for depression and anxiety disorder. o If it is not possible for your child to spend time with friends in person, arrange virtual video calls with peers. Did you leave any of these statements unchecked? If so, you may need to consider making changes to your child's routine. Discuss healthy behaviors with your child's pediatrician. Ask for referrals to professionals for help with SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 40specific issues (for example, a registered dietitian, a child-life specialist or a mental health professional). What are some steps you can take to improve your child's overall health and well-being? (Do not make changes to your child's diet or exercise plan without first talking to the pediatrician.) _________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ Other Childhood Healthcare Needs As part of a healthy lifestyle, in addition to screening for cancer relapse and the long-term and late effects of treatment, all children and teens need to see their pediatrician at least once a year to be screened for proper growth and development and for other diseases that may be unrelated to the cancer diagnosis. This is often called a \"well-child\" visit. Children under 3 years of age will see their pediatrician more often. The specific screening recommendations for your child will depend on their age, sex and medical history.

Your child may need to delay getting certain vaccines during cancer treatment. After treatment is completed, work with your child's healthcare team to create an appropriate catch-up schedule for your child. Some vaccines may need to be repeated or your child may need an additional booster of previously received vaccines.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 43Immunization Record Vaccine Date(s) GivenComments/ Reactions Hepatitis Rotavirus Diphtheria, tetanus, & acellular pertussis (DTap: to view the CDC's recommended vaccination schedule, by age. 1 Live Vaccines. Vaccines that contain a live virus are dangerous for immunosuppressed patients. Live vaccines include MMR, varicella (chicken pox) and flu nasal spray. If anyone in the home or who spends time with your child will be receiving a live virus, such as the shingles vaccine, tell your child's healthcare team. Ask what precautions to take. Siblings. Siblings should continue to receive their regularly scheduled vaccinations. If a sibling will be receiving a vaccine with a live virus, ask the healthcare team if you need to take any precautions. 2 Flu Shot. An annual flu shot is recommended for all children older than 6 months, even children receiving cancer treatment. Your child should receive the flu shot, which is made from the dead virus. They must not get the nasal spray vaccine because the spray contains the live flu virus. The live virus can be dangerous for immunosuppressed patients. Everyone in your home or who spends time with your child should also receive the flu shot, not the nasal spray vaccine. 3 COVID-19. Discuss the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) vaccine with your child's healthcare team. Research on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in children is ongoing.

Even years after diagnosis or treatment, some children continue to struggle with feelings of sadness, anxiety, grief or guilt. Some of the specific emotions that childhood cancer survivors may struggle with include: \"Survivor's guilt,\" especially if a close friend or family member passed away from cancer Fear that their cancer may come back or get worse. This fear may become worse around the anniversary of their diagnosis. Anxiety about checkups and screenings that either surfaces or become worse, called \"scanxiety\" Sense of loss or grief for their life before the cancer diagnosis, especially in older children and teens Having these feelings is normal; however, negative feelings shouldn't be interfering with your child's daily life, growth and development. Childhood Depression, Anxiety and Other Mental Health Issues Signs of mental health issues in children may include: Loss of pleasure in favorite activities Stomachaches or headaches that don't seem to have another cause Eating more or less than usual MENTAL HEALTH FOR PARENTS While caring for your child is likely your top priority, your own mental health is very important too.

Self-Care at Every Age Tips and ideas to help your child learn self-care Baby/Toddlers (0 to 3 Years) When your child is a baby or toddler, you will be responsible for most aspects of self-care. Helping your child with hand washing, teeth brushing, regular bathing and cleaning their face after eating is a way to show that you care and to begin to teach your child the importance of self-care and good hygiene. Teach your toddler to wash their hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds by singing their ABCs. o Hand washing is very important, especially if your child is immunosuppressed from cancer treatment.

This may include: o Getting dressed and/or choosing clothes o Wiping up spills SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 52 o Putting toys away o Using a napkin or wet wipe to clean hands and face Self-care for infants and toddlers may include: o Supervised short time periods for infants to lay on their belly to help build muscles and mobility, often called \"tummy time\" o Holding your child o Listening to music o Reading to your child o Playing with safe, age-appropriate toys that allow your child to learn and explore, such as soft or textured toys (stuffed animals), toys that make noise (rattles), toys to build or create (blocks, non-toxic crayons or markers), things to pretend with (dolls, cars) o Check the tag or box of toys for safe age ranges. Watch out for toys with small parts that could be a choking hazard.

Allow your child to pick out their own clothes and outfits. Encourage good hygiene, including washing well and wearing deodorant as your child enters puberty. Hand washing helps prevent infections and illness which is especially important for children in cancer treatment. Prepare your child for the changes they may experience as they enter puberty such as additional body hair or the beginning of the menstrual cycle (period). Members of the healthcare team can help with this discussion. o Childhood cancer treatment can cause delays or changes to the onset of puberty.

Encourage your teen to adopt healthy behaviors to care for their physical and emotional well-being. (See Healthy Behavior Recommendations on page 37.) When teenagers are struggling to find independence, a cancer diagnosis may feel like a setback and lead to feelings of frustration and anger. They may try to test boundaries or engage in risky behaviors such as drinking, drug use or sex. Educate your teen about safe sex and consent, even if you think they are not sexually active. Provide comprehensive sexual education related to sexual behaviors, risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You can ask the healthcare team for help with this discussion. During cancer treatment there may be additional risks associated with sexual activities. Teens who are sexually active must: o Use some form of birth control. o Use condoms or another barrier method, to protect against STDs. Oral contraception (birth control pills) and implants (for example, an intrauterine device [IUD]) do not protect against STDs. o Visit www.cdc.gov/sexualhealth for more information. Talk to your teen about tobacco, drug and alcohol use, even if you believe they do not use them. These substances can increase the risk of disease and may not be safe to use during cancer treatment or while taking certain medications. o If your child does smoke, visit https://smokefree.gov for resources to help them quit. Allow your teenager to speak to members of the healthcare team privately about sensitive matters such as mental health, sex, tobacco, drug, alcohol use or any other issues. Teenagers may struggle with body image and self-esteem. (See Body Image and Self Esteem on page 55.) Self-care for a teenager may include: o JournalingSURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 55 o Music, art or other form of creative expression o Hobbies such as reading, video games or baking o Spending time with friends and family o Attending a peer support group o Exercising or playing sports o Hiking or spending times outdoors o Practicing personal care, such as taking long baths, painting nails or using face masks o Learning to take all medications as prescribed (with adult supervision) o Identifying and using a \"Stay Calm Strategy\" (See Stay Calm Strategy on page 48.) o Creating an intentional self-care plan (Visit www.LLS.org/FamilyWorkbook to download the Creating a Self-Care Plan worksheet.) Share the Information for Teens handout in the pocket on the back cover of this workbook with your teenager. This handout provides information about survivorship for your teenager to read. Encourage your teenager to come to you and/or members of their healthcare team with any questions or concerns. Visit www.LLS.org/FamilyWorkbook to view the Caring for Your Child During Treatment chapter for information on hygiene and personal care. Body Image and Self-Esteem Almost every person struggles with body image and self-esteem at some point, but childhood cancer survivors may face unique challenges. Cancer treatment can cause changes to the body such as hair loss, weight loss or weight gain, and skin changes. Your child may especially struggle with body image around puberty. Comments or even bullying SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 56from classmates due to changes in appearance could possibly make this worse. Visit www.stopbullying.gov for bullying prevention resources.

When they finish the drawing, ask them to describe it to you. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 58Here are some other things you can do to help your child feel more comfortable: Provide clothes that are comfortable. Don't worry about the number on the tag. Your child can wear the size or style that feels the best on their body. Monitor the media your child consumes. Encourage your child to avoid looking at images online and in magazines that make them feel badly about their body or appearance. Teach your child to treat their body well by adopting healthy habits. See Healthy Behavior Recommendations on page 37. Encourage your child to move their body with daily exercise and/or play. Ask the healthcare team for an exercise program. o As a side effect of treatment, your child may have mobility or balance issues. Ask for a referral to a physical therapist to help with these issues and to discuss appropriate forms of physical activity. Watch for negative self-talk (thinking or saying negative things about oneself). Children are often their own harshest critics. The next time you hear your child say something negative about themselves, ask \"Would you say or think that sort of thing about your friend?\" Help your child to learn to treat and think of themselves in the same way they would talk to or about someone they love. Try not to talk about appearance or body size around your child. Try not to criticize yourself or others in front of your child. If other people your child spends time with talk about appearance or body size around your child, ask them not to. Almost everyone is self-conscious about their appearance, and talking about it frequently only adds to those feelings. There are much more interesting things to talk about! Teach your child that you don't have to love everything about your body, but you do need to respect and care for it. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 59 Ask members of your child's healthcare team for a referral to a therapist or counselor who can help your child work on self-esteem. When children reach their preteen or teenage years, they often become more aware of their bodies. They may feel pressure to look a certain way or be a certain size. To achieve this, they may even try trendy diets, pills or supplements, or other dangerous weight-loss techniques. Visit the National Eating Disorders Association website at www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/warning-signs-and- symptoms to learn the warning signs and symptoms for an eating disorder. If you suspect your child is struggling with an eating disorder, talk to your child's pediatrician. Ask for a referral to a registered dietitian and/or therapist who specializes in eating disorders. Ask Your Child to Take the Pledge Read the pledge on the next page to your child or allow your child to read alone. Talk through any questions or thoughts that come up. If your child wants to add any additional goals to the pledge, add them in the blank spaces at the end of the list.

Many aspects of life may have felt uncertain. However, most childhood cancer survivors can expect to lead full and productive lives. As your child nears the end of cancer treatment, you and your child may be ready to think about the future again. Your child's transition to adult life could include college; vocational or technical school; internships; apprenticeships; employment and independent living. Your child may move out of your home or even to a new city. They will need new skills such as money management and advocating for their own healthcare. Check out the following resources that can help you and your child achieve these future goals. Support for the Future The information and resources in this list are organized by subjects that may be part of your child's future plans. Some of these resources are from The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) and some are from different organizations that specialize in specific issues. College If your child plans to attend college, their high school guidance counselor can help identify colleges that fit their needs and goals. Your child also may be eligible for scholarships or financial aid. Your child may want to keep in mind the following questions when researching different colleges: Does the school have a good track record of serving the needs of students with disabilities? SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 63 Does the school offer online classes? (Online classes can be a good alternative to physically attending class.) Is the school located near a cancer treatment center and/or cancer survivorship clinic that will make it easy to continue follow-up care? Will the health insurance plan cover care that is provided by the center or clinic close to the school? What financial aid or scholarships are available? o To help childhood cancer survivors offset the cost of education, scholarships and grants are sometimes available. Visit www.LLS.org/scholarships to view a list of potential scholarships. Would a community or technical college offer similar programs? If your child has an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or 504 Plan in high school, they may qualify for accommodations for college entrance examinations, such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), and for additional accommodations at the post-secondary level. Work closely with a guidance counselor to determine when to apply for accommodations and what documentation is required to obtain them. Career As a person who has a history of cancer, your child can best protect themselves from employment discrimination by learning how to advocate for their rights in the workplace. Your child can visit www.LLS.org/EmploymentRights to learn more about employment discrimination laws and how to enforce their legal rights. At this link, your child can also find tips for the job application process. If your child plans to enter the workforce after graduating from high school, they can ask their guidance counselor for help and information about resources available to them. If your child attends SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 64college, most colleges and universities provide Career Services for students and alumni to assist with job search preparation and professional development. Career Services may provide a tool to search for employment opportunities and help with tasks such as creating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and practicing for interviews. Cancer and Careers https://www.cancerandcareers.org/ Cancer and Careers empowers and educates people with cancer to thrive in their workplace, by providing expert advice, interactive tools and educational events. The organization also offers a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 review service (https://www.cancerandcareers.org/resume_reviews/new) and a comprehensive database of helpful resources. Finances Teach your child about personal finances such as budgeting and saving. As your child enters adulthood and begins a career, they will need to know how to manage their finances responsibly. For childhood cancer survivors, maintaining health insurance is very important. Young adults can remain on a parent's or legal guardian's health insurance plan until they turn 26 years old. After that, they will need to find their own health insurance plan. Young adults also need to learn how to create and follow a budget and to manage their finances. For information on budgeting and the different types of health insurance, visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Cancer and Your Finances. The booklet also includes worksheets to help navigate health insurance and create a personal budget.

Transitioning to Adult Healthcare As your child transitions to adult healthcare, you can give them this completed workbook so they have a detailed record of their cancer treatment and information about possible long-term and late effects. Your child can share this information with all new healthcare providers. Teaching Your Child to Navigate the Healthcare System It is important for everyone (parents and children, as age appropriate) to learn how to navigate the healthcare system and advocate for care. To be successful, a person needs to be able to: Talk to healthcare professionals and ask questions SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 66 Request written information about a diagnosis, treatment, or medication Know family and personal medical history Alert the healthcare team to any new or worsening signs and/or symptoms Schedule appointments Take an insurance card and a list of all current medications to appointments Make appointments with new providers Seek a second opinion or ask for a referral to a specialist, when needed Know how to access medical records Maintain recommended follow-up and disease-screening schedules Stay up-to-date on recommended vaccinations Make sure that medications are taken as prescribed Check with members of the healthcare team before taking any new medications (including over-the-counter medications, vitamins and supplements) Be honest with the healthcare team about lifestyle, including drug and alcohol use and sexual activity Understand health insurance coverage and medical costs File a claim with insurance providers and appeal an unapproved claim Every child, depending on their age, can learn many of these skills. Allow your child to learn by participating in their own care, as age appropriate. For example, encourage them to ask members of the healthcare team questions. Some children may wish to administer their own medications. You can allow them to do so, with your supervision. By learning and practicing, your child will develop the necessary skills and awareness to advocate for their own care in the future. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 67When Your Child Becomes a Legal Adult Your child's need for follow-up care will continue even after they become an adult. Educate your young adult on the importance of follow-up care. Keep in mind that the day your child becomes a legal adult, members of the healthcare team will start asking them to make medical decisions and sign consent forms. Your young adult will need to give providers permission in order for healthcare professionals to communicate with you about their medical information. Changing Healthcare Providers If your young adult moves away from home for college or work, they will need to find new healthcare providers to continue follow-up care. Your young adult can ask members of the healthcare team for a referral to a provider who can provide the necessary follow-up care. Any new providers will need to know your young adult's detailed medical history. Your young adult should work with members of the healthcare team that treated the cancer to coordinate care and transfer medical records to new providers. Visit Got Transition\u00ae at www.gottransition.org for a list of available healthcare resources and more information about the process of transitioning from pediatric healthcare to adult healthcare. Advance Care Planning All adults, even young adults, can participate in advance care planning.

Visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Advance Care Planning.Give this completed workbook to your young adult so they have a record of their cancer diagnosis, treatment and long-term and late effects screening recommendations.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 68Other Adult Healthcare Needs As a natural part of aging, your child may also need to begin screening for other diseases and conditions that are unrelated to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Most diseases are easier to treat or manage if discovered early. Many disease screening tests can be part of an annual wellness exam. A primary care provider can help coordinate any tests. Diseases commonly screened for include: Some types of cancer, including colorectal, breast, cervical, prostate High blood pressure and high cholesterol levels (risk factors for heart disease) Diabetes Osteoporosis (weak bones) STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) Mental health conditions, such as depression The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires most insurance plans to cover preventative services at no cost. Visit www.health.gov/myhealthfinder. Use the MyHealthfinder to get disease screening and vaccine recommendations, based on age and sex. The MyHealthfinder recommendations come from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Discuss results with your child's primary care provider.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 69NOTESSURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l a Questions to Ask Members of the Healthcare Team and ResourcesSURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 71Questions to Ask Members of the Healthcare Team If either you or your child has questions, ask the members of the healthcare team for answers.

Daily medications and hospital visits can be upsetting, frustrating or even boring, but it is important to follow your treatment plan exactly how your doctor prescribes. o Missing medications or doing activities your healthcare team told you to avoid can be dangerous. Your medications may not work as well or you may have more side effects or complications. Side Effects You may have side effects from treatment such as fatigue, nausea and vomiting, hair loss, mouth sores, or others. o Ask your healthcare team what to expect and how to make side effects better. o Tell your healthcare team about any new or worsening side effects you have. Your immune system fights illness and infections. Cancer and cancer treatment can weaken your immune system, so it may be easier for you to get sick. Your healthcare team may suggest that you take steps to protect yourself, such as washing your hands more and avoiding people who are sick and some activities. o Ask your healthcare team what you can do to prevent illness and infection. Fertility Cancer treatment can also affect your fertility. o Fertility is the ability to have a biological child. If your cancer treatment may affect your fertility, you may have the option to take steps to preserve your fertility through a process called egg freezing or sperm \"banking.\" This usually needs to be done before treatment that can affect fertility begins. Talk to your healthcare team about what this means for your fertility. o If you are getting your period, cancer treatment can interrupt or stop your cycle. Even if your period stops, you still may be able to become pregnant. Ask your healthcare team what to expect and let them know about any changes you experience.

SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 82Mental Health and Self-Care Mental health, like physical health, is important to your overall well-being. You may experience feelings of sadness, anxiety, grief or guilt. These feelings are normal. Most cancer patients, even adults, have them at some point. Talk to someone you trust about how you are feeling. If these feelings begin to be scary or overwhelming, talk to your healthcare team and your parent or guardian for help. Self-care can help improve your mental health. Self-care can include Journaling Music, drawing or painting Hobbies such as reading, video games or baking Spending time with friends and family Walking or spending time outdoors Hygiene and personal care such as bathing and brushing your teeth Eating a variety of nutritious foods Asking a trusted adult for help when you are sad, scared or overwhelmedIf you are having trouble coping and do not know who you can turn to for support, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-TALK ([800] 273-8255) to talk to a community crisis center representative. The Lifeline is free, confidential and always available. Friends During treatment, you may find that some of your friends are your biggest supporters. Even if you may not be able to spend as much time with them while you are in treatment, you can stay in touch with them through video calls and messaging. Other friends may not know how to cope with your diagnosis. Although this may hurt, try not to take it personally. Not everyone knows how to handle a cancer diagnosis. Focus on the friends who do stick around. Connect with other teens with a cancer diagnosis. Talking to someone who understands what you are going through can be very helpful. o Ask your healthcare team about local and online support groups. Be careful about what you post on social media. Ask your parent or guardian for permission to have a social media account. When posting on social media, remember that even a private profile may not be as private as you think. Would you be upset if a new friend, a date, or employer learned about your diagnosis from an internet search? Take time to think it over before you share personal information online. Ask to talk to a therapist or social worker. A therapist or social worker can provide you with tools to identify and cope with your emotions in a healthy way. Therapy can be beneficial for everyone, not just those with symptoms of depression or anxiety.

You may also not feel your best or feel more tired than usual. Puberty can also change the way your body looks and feels. Be gentle with yourself. Your appearance does not determine your worth. You do not have to love everything about your body, but you do need to respect and care for it. School You may not be able to attend school during treatment, but you can still continue your education. You may work with a teacher at the treatment center or be able to participate in classes virtually. When you can attend school in person again, work with your parent or guardian, healthcare team, and teacher or guidance counselor to help you return to school. Let them know about any concerns or questions you have. There are resources to help you. Future Plans You may already be thinking about your plans for after high school. Your plans may include college, vocational or technical school, internships, employment or independent living. o Discuss your goals and dreams with your parent or guardian, healthcare team, and guidance counselor to see what you can do to stay on track. o There may be resources to help you such as scholarships for cancer survivors. The day you become a legal adult, your healthcare team will begin to ask you to make medical decisions and sign consent forms. o If you still want to have your parent or guardian make decisions for you, you can sign paperwork to allow your healthcare team to continue to communicate with your parent or guardian about your medical needs.Read and work through Body Image and Self-Esteem on page 55 with your parent or guardian.
