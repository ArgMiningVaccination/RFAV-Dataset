As of December 16, 2021, almost 4,822,472 people had died and over 236,132,082 were infected with this lethal viral infection. It is believed that the human immune system is thought to play a critical role in the initial phase of infection when the viruses invade the host cells. Although some effective vaccines have already been on the market, researchers and many bio-pharmaceuticals are still working hard to develop a fully functional vaccine or more effective therapeutic agent against the COVID-19. Other efforts, in addition to functional vaccines, can help strengthen the immune system to defeat the corona virus infection. Herein, we have reviewed some of those proven measures, following which a more efficient immune system can be better prepared to fight viral infection. Among these, dietary supplements like- fresh vegetables and fruits offer a plentiful of vitamins and antioxidants, enabling to build of a healthy immune system. While the pharmacologically active components of medicinal plants directly aid in fighting against viral infection, supplementary supplements combined with a healthy diet will assist to regulate the immune system and will prevent viral infection. In addition, some personal habits, like- regular physical exercise, intermittent fasting, and adequate sleep, had also been proven to aid the immune system in becoming an efficient one. Maintaining each of these will strengthen the immune system, allowing innate immunity to become a more defensive and active antagonistic mechanism against corona-virus infection. However, because dietary treatments take longer to produce beneficial effects in adaptive maturation, personalized nutrition cannot be expected to have an immediate impact on the global outbreak. https://www.ijhsr.org/IJHSR_Vol.10_Issue.8_Aug2020/IJHSR_Abstract.016.html The Lethal novel coronavirus, COVID-19, caused by specific Coronavirus (SARS-CoV 2) began in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019. The emerging infectious viral diseases with pathogenic properties present a major public health issue worldwide. It has been spreading expeditiously across the globe and recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The review focused on strengthening the immune system with plant-based food of all age groups to counter novel coronavirus. The immune system is involved in the detection of the host against a variety of agents from viruses to parasitic worms, thereby protecting the integrity of the body. Even though no vaccine has been developed yet, healthy dietary patterns will improve immunometabolism. A well-balanced diet should be maintained for the normal functioning of the immune system with adequate intakes of micronutrient and macronutrient. Diet with a variety of fruits, vegetables, pulses and unprocessed foods is a key component, which provides vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, protein, and antioxidants and plays a vital role in preserving the immune system against infection and other diseases. Nonetheless, there is a need for preparedness of global health security by optimizing the nutritional status that is crucial for a healthy immune system to prevent COVID-19 by staying physically active, good hygiene practice, and staying home. MedPress Nutrition & Food Sciences 2022 International journal of applied chemical and biological sciences 2021 A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread from a regular seafood market in Wuhan, China to more than 200 countries, globally infecting millions of people with a dangerous pneumonia like fatal conditions. Depending upon the immunity of individual, the severity of infection and its viral load, symptoms varied from mild to severe leading to Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. Thus, in order to combat the symptoms and reduce the death rate it was accepted globally to use pre-used anti-viral, anti-malaria, antiinflammatory and various immune-boosters drugs. The drugs are undergoing clinical trials to increase its safety efficiency simultaneously suppressing viral infection. Along with drugs, the micronutrients like vitamin C, vitamin D and Zinc are also used as immune-boosters in combination with drugs to increase the efficiency rate and reduce the side effects. Following review, describes the clinical trials currently undergoing and importance of micro-and macro nutrients to overcome hyper-inflammation and cytokine storm generated by SARS-CoV-2. The resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the concern among the people for their good health by taking immune boosting foods that can protect from this life threatening disease. The of a healthy diet are addressed by several researchers in their publications. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, the plant based diet may also play an increased role to boost the immunity of the body and thus may help in its prevention. Some of the fruits and vegetables like oranges, lemons, strawberries, kiwis, black berries, papaya, grapefruits, avocado, pineapple, peach, guavas, grapes, apples, red mangoes, bananas, watermelon, gooseberry, cabbages, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, tomatoes, potatoes, green peas, carrots, spinach, ginger, turmeric etc., are rich sources of minerals, vitamins, antioxidants and polyphenols that support the immune system of the body and also promote overall health and wellness of the human beings. The strong immune system and thus help to protect the health. 2020 Worldwide, there is an array of clinical trials under way to evaluate treatment options against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Concurrently, several nutritional therapies and alternative supportive treatments are also being used and tested to reduce the mortality associated with acute respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19. In the context of COVID-19, improved nutrition that includes micronutrient supplementation to augment the immune system has been recognized as a viable approach to both prevent and alleviate the severity of the infection. The potential role of micronutrients as immune-boosting agents is particularly relevant for low- and middle-income countries, which already have an existing high burden of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. A systematic literature review was performed to identify nutritional interventions that might prevent or aid in the recovery from COVID-19. The PubMed, S... Annals of Phytomedicine: An International Journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science 2021 The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) has raised considerable concern on the entire planet. On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was categorized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic infection, and by March 18, 2020, it has spread to 146 countries. The first internal defense line against numerous diseases is personalized immunity. Although it cannot be claimed that personalized nutrition will have an immediate impact on a global pandemic, as the nutritional interventions required a long time to induce beneficial outcomes on immunity development, nutritional strategies are still able to clarify and have a beneficial influence on the interplay between physiology and diet, which could make a positive contribution to the condition in the next period. As such, a specific goal for every practitioner is to evaluate different tests to perceive the status of the patient, such as markers of inflammation, insulin regulation, and nutrient status, and to detect possible i... 2020 This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution International License (CC BY 4.0). Nowadays, world is facing the life-threatening disease SARS-CoV-2 which creates panic situation among people because of no effective treatment modality and lack of chances to get novel vaccination. In such circumstances, self-isolation and prevention to get expose to viral environment is best strategy to safe our society. Healthy and nutritional dietary measures can facilitate us to boost our immunity system against viral attacks. In this review, we discussed the importance of organic diets that can be used to fight against SARSCoV-2 infection by improving the immune system as pretreatment strategy. We also discussed other factors that can improve immune system such as reducing the stress and inflammation, avoid smoking and toxins and doing moderate exercise daily. Meanwhile, plasma therapy is also under examination to save patient's life, and discussed in this review. International Conference on COVID-19 2020 Immunity is defined as the body's ability to fight infections, diseases and other foreign invasions. Strengthening the immune system with healthy and balanced nutrition is very important in protecting against Covid-19 pandemic and many diseases or in the treatment stage of many diseases. The immune system is responsible for protecting from harmful environmental agents, especially pathogenic microorganisms, which can be in the form of bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. Immunity is mainly acquired by the body in two ways; one is innate immunity and the other is acquired immunity. Genetically existing, innate immunity creates the first response to a foreign invasion in the body. Acquired immunity develops when in contact with an agent that causes the disease, with actions acquired over time and vaccination. The immune system always works, but defense cells are activated by the presence of pathogens. Cellular proliferation occurs at the important level in the immune response, thereby increasing the number of immune cells for defense. DNA, RNA, protein and complex lipid synthesis is done for cellular proliferation, and substrates must be available to support this. Many different vitamins and minerals are needed as cofactors for metabolic mechanisms involved in energy production and biosynthesis. Amino acids (e.g. arginine) are pioneers in the synthesis of polyamines that have roles in DNA replication and regulation of cell division. Various micronutrients (e.g. iron, folate, zinc, magnesium) are also involved in nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis. Some foods, such as vitamins A and D, and their metabolites, are direct regulators of gene expression in immune cells and play an important role in immune cell maturation, differentiation, and responsiveness. The role of nutrients in supporting the function of the immune system is very diverse and if a healthy immune response is desired, they must be found in the body in a sufficient and balanced way. Good nutrition creates an environment where the immune system can react appropriately. This paper discusses the role of certain nutrients, particularly in antiviral defenses, in supporting the immune system, for the aim to draw attention to the importance of strengthening the immune system in protecting against Covid-19 and fighting pandemics. Journal of Science and Technology 2020 Now a days the news of coronavirus is on all news paper's headline. Coronavirus is spreading from animal market of Wuhan in central China. There are several types of coronavirus but all are not dangerous but this new coronavirus is very dangerous. It is a group of RNA viruses that cause a variety of disease in animal and animal to human. The efficiency of this new coronavirus found in the live animal market of Wuhan in central China, circulate in a range of animals and spread from animal to animal and animal to human also which is called Spillover. Mild symptoms of coronavirus are cough, shortness of breath and severe problems are pneumonia, kidney failure and death also. Basically corona virus effects on immune systems and decrease the immune power. There are no specific treatments or vaccines for this disease still now. So in this condition, people have to maintain immunity and should increase immune power to fight against coronavirus. Only washing hand and wearing a mask are not enough to fight against this virus, people have to modify their daily diet. This article summarizes the immune-boosting therapeutic diet against coronavirus (COVID-19). Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
