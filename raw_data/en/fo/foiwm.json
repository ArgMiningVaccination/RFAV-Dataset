By contrast, the incidence of subcardial gastric cancer, in which H Pylori and cadherin gene inactivation play major etiologic roles, has decreased significantly in the US and the West. In addition, ample epidemiologic and biologic evidence indicates that adenocarcinom as of the GEJ/cardia, as well as of the esophagus, are biologically distinct from esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). 1.2 Curative -intent treatment for resectable, locally advanced GEJ/cardia cancers involves neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery (ie, trimodality therapy) Almost half the patients with esophageal/GEJ/cardia cancer present with resectable, locally advanced disease. Standard treatment includes weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) with paclitaxel (50 mg/m2), combined with concurrent radiation ( RT; 41.4 Gy to 50.4 Gy) for 5.5 weeks. Within 4-8 weeks of completing chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT), a PET/CT is performed to assess for metastatic disease; and once disseminated disease is excluded, surgical resection is perfo rmed. Though a serie s of small randomized trials supported the addition of chemoRT to surgery in esophageal/GEJ cancer, the trimodality approach was established as a worldwide standard of care based on the CROSS trial 2. In CROSS (N = 366), patients with esophageal/GEJ cancer was randomly assigned 1:1 to receive neoadjuvant therapy with weekly carboplatin/pac litaxel plus concurrent RT followed by surgery vs surgery alone. By histology, 275 (75%) had adenocarcinoma, 84 (23%) had squamous- cell carcinoma, and 7 (2%) had large- cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Overall survival (OS), the primary endpoint, was signif icantly improved in the chemoRT arm (HR 0.66; P =.003; median 49 vs 24 months). Other endpoints also favored the chemoRT arm: Complete resection with no tumor within 1 mm of the resection margins (R0) was achieved in 92% of patients in the chemoRT -surgery group vs 69% in the surgery group ( P <0.001). A pathological complete response (pathCR) was achieved in 47 of 161 patients (29%) who underwent resection after chemoradiotherapy. ChemoRT was well -tolerated. Utilizing chemoRT plus surgery for GEJ adenocarcinomas is a favored approach among leading cancer centers in the U.S., as demonstrated by the design of most large NCI - sponsored trials ( eg, RTOG-1010, CALGB 9781), and at other cancer centers in the world. 1.3 Death from GEJ/cardia adenocarcinoma following trimodality therapy usually results from disease occurrence in distant anatomic regions outside the original radiation field Although the OS observed in the CROSS trial was higher than seen in all prior large trials for patients with locally ad vanced esophageal/GEJ adenocarcinoma, cure rates remained low: OS rates in the chemoRT arm were 58% at 3 years and 47% at 5 years. These data reflect the aggressive biology of this disease and the need for novel therapies 2. In one of the largest reported GEJ/esophageal adenocarcinoma cohorts ( N = 518; 65% had 6 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 underwent trimodality therapy at a single institution and where site of recurrence data was collected, 41% (215/ 518) of patients experienced disease relapse after a median follow up of 29 months. Among relapses, 87% (188/215) included a distant site outside the original radiation field3. A more recent report from the same institution after longer follow up (median 37 months) described similar results: 40% of patients (144/356) with esophageal/GEJ cancer tumors ) experienced relapse after trimodality therapy, of which 83% (119 /144) included distant metastases outside the radiation field 4. It is generally accepted that occurrence of disease in distant sites results from growth of micrometastases that were present, but we re by definition undetectable, at the time of trimodality therapy. The sites of recurrence among chemoRT -surgery patients in the CROSS trial were most 3. In the single institution series described above of post -trimodality patients, the most common anatomic sites of distant metastases, as the first exclusive event, were lung (20%), distant lymph nodes (13%), liver (7%)4. 1.4 Pembrolizumab Cancer cells are known to have the ability to evade immunosurveillance through a variety of mechanisms, including reduced expression of tumor antigens, downregulation of MHC class I and II molecules for reduced tumor antigen presentation, secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines such TGF -beta, as regulato ry T cells (Tr eg) or myeloid derived and overexpression of certain ligands ( eg, PDL1) that inhibit the host 's antibodies targeting the PD -1/PD -L1 or PD -L2 pathway have shown clinical benefit in melanoma, with promising activity multiple solid tumors. The programmed death 1 (PD- 1) pathway is a negative feedback system that represses Th1 cytotoxic immune responses and that, if unregulated, can damage the host6-8. It is up - regulated in many tumors and in their surrounding microenvironment. Blockade of this pathway with antibodies to PD- 1 or its ligands has led to remarkable clinical responses in patients with many different types of cancer, including melanomas, non-small -cell lung cancer, renal -cell carcinoma, bladder The expression of PD-1 ligands (PD-L1 or PD- L2) on the surface of tumor cells or immune cells is an important \u2014but not a definitive \u2014 predictive biomarker of response to PD-1 blockade9,11-13, 16. Immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming immunotolerance and improving the activation of antitumor T cells represent a new promising therapeutic approach. Among them, pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. It was recently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease prog ression V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. In a phase I study, 655 patients with advanced melanoma were treated with pembrolizumab in four treatment cohorts using one of three dose schedules (10 mg/kg every two weeks, 10 mg/kg every three weeks, or 2 mg/kg every three weeks). Approximately three-fourths of patients had received prior systemic therapies for metastatic disea se, including 52 percent who had received prior ipilimumab . Results from this study were updated at the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting 17. The overall objective response rate using RECIST criteria and central review was 33 %; similar response rates were seen using immune- related response criteria. OS at 12 months was 66% and 49% at 24 months. MC1541 7 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Median PFS was 4.4 months, and 35% o f patients remained progression free at 12 months. On multivariate analysis, there were no significant differences in outcomes between the three dose schedules. In the randomized cohorts, there were no differences in objective response rates between those treated with either 2 mg/kg every three weeks or 10 mg/kg every three weeks. Preliminary analyses studied PD -L1 expression in the tumor as a predictive marker for responsiveness to pembrolizumab . Although these studies suggested that PD-L1 positivity correlated with increased responsiveness, absence of PD -L1 expression did not preclude a clinical response. Treatment toxicity was manageable; 83 percent of patients experienced one or more treatment- related adverse events. The most common toxicities were fatigue, pruritus, rash, diarrhea, and and 16% , respectively). Overall 14% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicity, the most common being fatigue (2% ), and there were no treatment -related deaths. There were similar safety profiles in those previously treated with ipilimumab and in those who were ipilimumab na\u00efve. Based upon these results, two phase III trials were conducted, one in patients whose disease was refractory to ipilimumab , and the other in patients who were treatment na\u00efve. In the KEYNOTE -002 trial, 540 patients with ipilimumab -refractory advanced melanoma were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every three weeks), pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg every weeks) paclitaxel alone, dacarbazine , or temozolomide per institutional standard) 18. Treatment continued until progressive disease. PFS assessed by central review, the primary endpoint of the trial, was significantly improved with both pembrolizumab treatment regimens compared with chemotherapy. The 6-month HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45-0.73, and pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg vs 0.39-0.64). The ORRs were 21%, 26%, and 4%, respectively. Treatment was relatively well tolerated, with grade 3 -5 adverse events reported in 11% and 14% of the pembrol izumab arms, and 26% of those managed with chemotherapy. The most common pembrolizumab- related adverse events were fatigue, pruritus, and rash. Grade 3 immune related toxicity was reported in two patients treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (hepatitis, hypophysitis), and in eight patients given pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg (hepatitis, colitis, pneumonitis, and iritis or uveitis). The 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses also had similar efficacy and toxicity in the three -armed phase III trial when they were compared with ipilimumab 19. Pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2014. The safety and efficacy of p embrolizumab monotherapy was recently assessed in patients with advanced non-small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC)20. In this study, 495 patients r eceived pembrolizumab (at a dose of 2 mg /kg or 10 mg /kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg /kg every 2 weeks) to either a training group (182 patients) or a validation group (313 patients). PD-L1 expression was assessed in tumor samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC), w ith results reported as the percentage of neoplastic cells with staining for membranous PD -L1 (proportion score). Response was assessed every 9 weeks by central review. Common side effects attributed to pembrolizumab were fatigue, pruritus, and decreased a ppetite, with no clear difference according to dose or schedule. Among all the patients, the ORR was 19.4%, and the median duration of response (DOR) was 12.5 months. Median PFS was 3.7 months, and median OS was 12.0 months. PD-L1 expression in at least 50 % of tumor cells was selected as the cutoff from the training group. Among patients with a proportion score of at least 50% in the validation group, the response rate was 45.2%. Among all the patients with a proportion score of at least 50%, median PFS was 6.3 months; median OS was not reached. Pembrolizumab had an acceptable side-effect profile and showed antitumor activity in MC1541 8 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 patients with advanced NSCLC . PD-L1 expression in at least 50% of tumor cells correlated with improved efficacy of pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab is being compared against chemotherapy in NSCLC . Pembrolizumab has also been studied in clinical trials in recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction, classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), urothelial tract c arcinoma, and head and neck cancer. Though observed response rates are promising, results are premature, and trials are single -armed with small numbers. 1.5 Pembrolizumab in advanced GEJ/gastric adenocarcinoma : proof of concept. The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with GEJ/gastric cancer was assessed in KEYNOTE -012 (NCT01848834) in a cohort of advanced disease 21. Archival tumor samples from patients from Asia- Pacific and rest of the world with recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or GEJ were screened for PD -L1 expression using a prototype IHC assay with the 22C3 antibody. Only patients with distinctive stromal or 1% tumor nest cell PD- L1 staining were eligible. Patients received pembrolizumab 1 0 mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 24 months or until complete response, progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Imaging was performed every 8 weeks. Primary efficacy end point was ORR assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review. Secondary end point s include d DOR , PFS, and OS. Of the 162 patients screened, 65 (40%) were PD- L1 +. Of these 65 patients, 39 enrolled (19 from Asia, 20 from rest of the world; median age, 63 years [range 33-78]). The number of prior therapies for advanced disease ranged from 0 to 5; 67% received 2 prior therapies. Median follow -up duration was 8.8 months (range 6.2-12.6); 13 patients (33%) remained on therapy at the time of analysis . Four patients experienced 5 total grade 3-5 drug- related adverse events: peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, decreased appetite, hypoxia, and pneumonitis (n = 1 each). There was 1 drug-related death (hypoxia). ORR was 22% (95% CI 10-39) by central review and 33% (95% CI 19- 50) by investigator review. Median time to response was 8 weeks (range 7 -16), with a median DOR of 24 weeks (range 8+ to 33+). PD- L1 expression level was associated with ORR (1 -sided P = 0.10). The 6- month PFS rate was 24%. The 6-month OS rate was 69%. These early results from a single- arm trial demonstrate that pembrolizumab monotherapy has manageable toxicity and promising antitumor activity in advanced GEJ/gastric cancer , and support ongoing development of pembrolizumab for GEJ/gastric cancer. Currently, pembrolizumab is being tested further in advanced GEJ/gastric can cer in the following planned or ongoing trials, including in combination with chemotherapy. KEYNOTE -059 (phase 2): C ombination with cisplatin -5FU chemotherapy and as monotherapy in patients with previously untreated GEJ/gastric cancer , and as monotherapy in the 3 rd-line setting KEYNOTE -061 (phase 3): C ombination with paclitaxel as compared 2nd-line KEYNOTE -062 (phase 3): Pembrolizumab as Monotherapy and in Combination with Cisplatin plus 5FU vs Placebo plus Cisplatin plus 5FU in 1st-line In these trials, a fixed dose of pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks is being utilized. The choice of a fixed dose is based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma to MC1541 9 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 be associated with maximal efficacy response, an d 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe. The above data indicate that the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose regimen planned to be used in this trial is likely similar with regard to efficacy and tolerability to the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose regimen used in KEYNOTE -012, and supports its use in this study. A fixed dose regimen will also be more convenient for physicians, reduce potential for dosing errors, reduce complexity in the logistical c hain at treatment facilities, and reduce wastage. 1.6 Adding pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemo radiotherapy may enhance antitumor activity in the primary tumor and exert greater control on the growth of distant micrometastases , partly through an abscopal effect The purpose of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in GEJ adenocarcinoma is to enhance locoregional control, and the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy is to enhance radiosensitization and to address micrometastatic disease 22,23. This combined modality approach is the most effective approach, to date, for treating locally advanced disease. However, the ability of current cytotoxic chemoagents to eradicate micrometastases is poor, yielding a 5 -year OS rate of <50%2. Clearly, novel approaches are necessary that can b uild on this combined modality approach. It has been hypothesized that radiotherapy acts as an \"in situ vaccine\" to prime the immune response. Despite the known benefit of ionizing radiation (IR) in local tumor control, it also enhances th e release of cyto kines such TGF -beta, a known inducer of tumor invasion and the epithelial- mesenchymal transition24-26. On the other hand, IR can also promote immune responses through the induction of neoantigens and the stimulation of factors such as IFN- gamma that can enhance T cell infiltration27. This dual ability to control local tumor progression and to influence metastatic spread and immune response constitutes a compelling argument for including radiation in combination with the current arsenal of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The abscopal effect refers to the ability of radiation delivered to a local site to minimize or eradicate metastases at distant sites. Although this phenomenon is not often described, it has led to complete regression of metastases at several anatomic sites in patients with lung adenocarcinoma 28 and melanoma29. Although radiotherapy causes tumor -cell apoptosis/necrosis, radiation alone is not suffic ient to trigger antigenic signals, and a second costimulatory signal is required to elicit systemic antitumor immune responses, especially in poorly immunogenic cancers30. Moreover, radiotherapy alone can sup press the growth of primary breast, colon, and lung cancer tumors but not the appearance of lung metastasis in mouse models30-32. Thus, the combination of radiotherapy with immune modulators may have the capability to escalate antitumor responses to a level that could suppress or eliminate systemic metastasis. Although anti-PD -1 and anti-CT LA-4 mAbs may overcome T- cell suppression, T -cell activation depends on the engagement of the antigen receptor and the activating costimulation molecule CD28 expressed by mature APCs33. In this regard , ionizing radiation can increase the production and presen tation of tumor antigens , not only by immunogenic cancers like melanoma but also by poorly immunogenic tumors; this, in turn, could augment the antitumor immune responses elicited by checkpoint immunomodulators anti-PD-1/PD -L1 and anti - CTLA-430,34,35. Preclinical studies have provided insight on how localized radiotherapy can induce the abscopal effects and have implicated the immune system as a crucial mediator (reviewed by MC1541 10 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Frey et al36). Local radiotherapy damages DNA within tumor cells, leading to tumor -cell apoptosis/necrosis, increasing cytotoxic T cell activity and the antigenic peptide pool34,37. Tumor antigens released from the dying tumor cells potentially can provide antigenic stimulation that induces antitumor -specific immune responses. This hypothesis is supported by the lack of the abscopal effect of radiotherapy in T cell -deficient (nude) mice or in mice with CD8+ T -cell depletion30,38,39. New data from Deng and colleagues40 suggests that the combination of radiation and PD- L1 checkpoint blockade can synergistically reduce MDSCs. Preclinica l studies of murine models have demonstrated that various immunomodulators benefit from combinations with radiation through antigen release41. Postow and colleagues29 and Hiniker and colleagues42 each reported systemic responses in patients with melanoma treated with the combined regimen of anti-CTLA -4 mAb ipilimumab and radiation, suggesting that coupling radiotherapy with immunotherapy may hold promise for inducing powerful, longterm abscopal effects in human patients. Demaria et al elegantly fo und that the abscopal effect could be tumor specific by administering the dendritic cell growth factor Flt3 -L to mice that were implanted in one flank with mammary 67NR tumor cells alone and in the contralateral flank with both 67NR tumor cells and A20 lymphoma cells 38. They irradiated the flank with only the 67NR tumor cells, which led to significant regression in the contralateral flank of the nonirradiated 67NR tumors, but did not affect the growth of the antigenically unrelated A20 lymphoma38. By contrast, Camphausen et al found that irradiating Lewis lung carcinoma cells restricted the growth of nonirradiated T241 (fibrosarcoma) cells that had been inoculated in a second site, suggesting that the abscopal effect of radiotherapy can also be mediated through other non- tumor- specific mechanisms, or that these two tumors are antigenically related 43. The systemic increase of many proinflammatory cyto kines and chemokines after radiation, from both immune cells and tumor tissues, could account for the nonspecific eradication of distant tumors and metastases 44. Alternatively, the release of low -affinity tumor antigens prompted by local radiotherapy may also stimulate the release of cross- reactive t umor antigens. An abscopal effect was observed in animal models of pancreatic cancer, whereby the addition of capecitabine to RT resulted in a synergistic inhibition of growth in lead-shielded distant tumors in the contralateral flank , which was associated with a decrease in proliferation 45. Similarly, in a preclinical colon adenocarcinoma model, marked inhibition of tumor growth at the non- irradiated site was observed with the addition of a chemokine ECI301 following radiation, as compared to radiation alone or chemokine alone46. Effect o f RT plus immunomodulation against micro - and macro -metastases. The concept that enhancement of the peptide pool via localized RT can suppress micrometastases was demonstrated by Chakravarty et al47. A highly metastatic and poorly immunogenic Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL/D122) was injected into the footpad of mice, and palpable tumors developed. At this time, histologic analysis of lung demonstrated the presence of microscopic pulmonary metastases. If the tumor- bearing leg is amputated, all animals are cured from the primary tumor, but are known to eventually succumb to massive lung metastases. Palpable tumors were given RT (one fraction of 60 Gy, which was previously demonstrated to cure the primary), followed by a 10-day course of Flt3L. Flt3L is a cytokine (naturall y occurring glycoprotein) that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of hematopoietic cells, including dentritic cells ( DCs) in vivo , both in mice and in humans, and that stimulates tumor- specific immune responses. DCs can acquire antigen from cells and induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) 48. Lung parenchyma of survivors in the RT + Flt3L cohort showed no carcinoma cells but had infiltrates of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and mononuclear leukocytes. By contrast, all animals who received RT alone or Flt3L alone had diffuse metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma cells. Mean lung weights , measured 21 days after RT (11 MC1541 11 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 days after Flt3L therapy), were significantly lower in the animals that received Flt3L + RT, as compared to RT alone or Flt3L alone. Contrary to these immunocompetent mice, nude mice receiving RT + Flt3L failed to eliminate pulmonary metastatic infiltrates. The combination of RT + Flt3L also improved animal survival. Together, these data indicate that the combination of improved antigen presentation and RT significantly suppressed micrometastases. The concept that anti -CTLA4 blockade plus RT can decrease lung metastases was demonstrated by Demaria et al30 in an animal model of mammary carcinoma 4T1. When injected subcutaneously in the mammary fatpad, 4T1 cells metastasize primarily by a hematogenous route and can be found in the lungs within 7 days. Given the poor immunogencity of 4T1 c ells, CTLA -4 blockade by the 9H10 mAb alone did not affect the tumor growth or survival of the mice. RT at a single dose of 12 Gy significantly delayed the growth of the primary irradiated tumor in the presence or absence of 9H10. To directly test the effects of treatment on lung metastases, all mice were sacrificed on day 35 post -tumor implantation, and the decrease in lung metastases was significant only when RT an d 9H10 were used in combination, consi stent with their observation that only this treatment resulted in increased survival. To confirm that the inhibition of lung metastases following RT + 9H10 treatment is mediated by T cells and to identify the population involved, mice were depleted of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells starting 3 days before RT treatment: The median number of metastases in mice treated with RT + 9H10 and depleted of CD8+ T cells was similar to control untreated animals. By contrast, the inhibition of lung metastases observed in mice treated with RT + 9H10 was not affected by CD4+ T- cell depletion. These results indicate that CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in the antimetastatic effect of the combination treatment. Augmented antitumor effect through the combination of a nti-PD-1 blockade plus RT . Anti-PD -1/-PD-L1 mAbs have drawn much interest for their potential use in lung or colon cancer49. The mechanism by which radiation augments the therapeutic effects of the anti -PD- 1/PD -L1 mAbs was elucidated in a preclinical study of triple -negative breast cancer. In this study, neither anti-PD -1 mAb nor radiation when given alone was effective in a murine model. However, the addition of anti-PD -1 mAbs promoted the rejection of irradiated tumors in the physio logically relevant tissue microenvironment of the mammary fat pad.50 Results of a preclinical study of murine intracranial glioma treated with anti -PD-1 mAbs plus radiotherapy showed not only long- term survival of the treated mice, but also robust systemic immunologic memory in the surviving mice, as they were able to reject a secondary challenge of glioma cells injected in the flank51. Specifically, median survival periods were similar for control mice (25 days) and mice given only anti-PD-1 mAbs (27 days) or radiation (28 days). However, the combination of radiation plus anti-PD -1 therapy extended the median surviva l to 53 days (P < 0.05), and 15% to 40% of mice survived more than 180 days after treatment51. The combination therapy increased tumor infiltration by CD8 + CTLs and decreased the number of CD4 +Tregs. Finally, in a test of immunologic memory, na\u00efve and long- term surviving mice were injected in the flanks with GL261-luc cells. All 8 na\u00efve mice died from the growth of the challenged glioma cells, whereas mice that received prior treatment with the combined regimen rejected the glioma challenge51. Increased PD -L1 expression in tumor tissue following ioni zing radiation While not definitive, t he expression of PD- 1 ligands (PD -L1 or PD -L2) on the surface of tumor cells or immune cells is an important predictive biomarker of response to PD -1 blockade9,11-13, 15,16. PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment has been associated with poor outcomes following chemoradiotherapy in cancer patients52,53. In KEYNOTE -012, the frequency of PDL1 expression was 40% in human GEJ/gastric cancers, and among PD- L1-expressing tumors, a higher degree of expression was non -significantly associated with improved outcome21. In the largest study evaluating PDL1 expression in gastric cancer, PD-MC1541 12 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 L1 expression was evaluated in resected specimens and was defined as 5% membrane expression on tumor cells with 1+ intensity54. In this study, PD-L1 expression was not observed in stroma in cases that lacked expression in tumor cells . The PD -L1+ frequency was 14% (57/398), and PD-L1+ protein expression was correlated with its mRNA expression. These data suggest that a minority of untreated gastric tumors express PD -L1 at baseline. In an important preclinical report, Deng et al found that ionizing radiation can induce expression of PD -L1 in tumor and their microenvironment40. In addition, they found that the addition of PD- L1 blockade to radiation con trols primary tumor growth in a CD8+ -dependent and tumor antigen-specific manner, leading to prolonged protective T cell immunity . They further found that the PD -L1/radiation combination induces an abscopal effect on non- irradiated distant tumors40. These data raise the possibility that exposure to radiation could induce tumors to develop a dependence on the PD- L1/PD -1 pathway as an immune escape mechanism, which could make those tumors more suspectible to PD -1/PD -L1 blockade. Fractionated ( vs radiotherapy has greater synergy with immune therapy Dewan et al tested the hypothesis that the type of dose f ractionation regimen of RT can determine the ability of RT to synergize with anti- CTLA -4 antibody31. In a mouse model where colon or breast cancer cells were injected into both flanks, single- dose or fractionated RT led to growth delay of the primary tumor, regardless of whether anti -CTLA-4 antibody was administered, but had no effect on secondary tumors outside the RT field. However, an abscopal effect on the secondary tumor outside the RT field only occurred in mice treated with the combination of antibody plus fractionated RT, not single-dose RT. The frequency of CD8+ T cells showing tumor -specific IFN -gamma production was proportional to the inhibition of the secondary tumor, suggesting that cell-mediated immunity was responsible for the abscopal effect. In addition, these investigators found that delaying the initiation of anti-CTLA -4 antibody until a few days after the com pletion of RT reduced the therapeutic effect on the primary and secondary tumor, as compared to initiating antibody treatment on the first or final day of RT (RT was given in 3 fractions of 6 Gy each). Of note, in Deng et al, PD-L1 blockade, administered e very 3 days for a total of 4 times, was initiated on the day of IR or 1 day before IR 40. 1.7 S afety for combining chemoradiotherapy with pembrolizumab In clinical trials completed to date, most immune related adverse events associated with pembrolizumab were mild (grade 1 -2), some were severe, and a few were lethal. The most common toxic effects were considered to be immunologic in origin, and the sites most commonly affected were the skin, gastrointestinal system, liver, and lung10,15,55. Neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel chemoradiotherapy in this disease is well tolerated, as reported 2 and based on our high- volume experience. In the CROSS trial, the most common major hematologic toxic effects in the chemoRT -surgery group were leukopenia (6%) and neutropenia (2%). The most common major non-hematologi c toxic effects were anorexia (5%) and fatigue (3%). Postoperative complications were similar in the two treatment groups, and in-hospital mortality was 4% in both. Risk of pneumonitis: R ationale for restrictions on age and pulmonary status The known toxicities of neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel/radiotherapy do not generally overlap with pembrolizumab (see below and Section 1.4 and 1.5). One potential exception is toxicity involving the thorax or upper abdomen related to organs within the RT field. MC1541 13 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Radiation pneumonitis is thought to reflect an immune- mediated inflammatory reaction to radiation -induced lung damage56,57. Severe forms can be lethal. Similarly, radiation treatment in the abdomen that could result in bowel radiation could similarly exacerbate colitis. Radiation pneumonitis has been reported in patients who have undergone mediastinal radiation therapy for lung cancer, Hodgkin's l ymphoma (HL), breast cancer, and other cancers that require radiation therapy to the thorax58. Radiation pneumonitis is reported in 5% to 15% of patients receiving definitive external-beam radiation therapy for lung cancer59. Clinical factors that may increase the risk of radiation pneumonitis include concomitant chemotherapy, previous irradiation, and recent withdrawal of steroids59, although patients treated with specific chemotherapeutic drugs, such as platinum, etoposide, taxanes, and vinorelbine, and concurrent radiotherapy do not appear to have a higher risk for radiation pneumonitis 60. A retrospective analysis of 1,911 patients who underwent combined- modality therapy for lung cancer demonstrated that the overall risk of radiation pne umonitis was 7.8%61. In a multivariate analysis, the daily fraction dose, number of daily fractions , and total dose were associated with radiation pneumonitis61. Both the V20 (ie, the percentage volume of both lungs minus the planning target volume [PTV] receiving 20 Gy) and the mean lung dose (MLD) correlate with the risk for radiation pneumonitis62. Although a V20 level of 35% to 37% or an MLD value of 20 to 23 Gy (both calculated with a more advanced algorithm) have been considered safe, ~10%- 15% of patients still may develop severe radiation -induced toxicity when they have received much lower doses63. Patie nt factors, such as lung function, age, and sex, do not adequately select patients at high risk for radiation pneumonitis or fibrosis64. Radiation pneumonitis is typically a delayed acute reactio n, usually occurring 1 to 3 months after completing mediastinal radiation therapy59. Patients who experience acute radiation pneumonitis will often have a self- limited course, wit h complete resolution of this process. However, a minority of patients may develop progressive pulmonary fibrosis, usually 6 to 24 months after treatment. Late complications of pulmonary fibrosis include cor pulmonale and respiratory failure 58. Although there is a lack of published data, the EORTC panel for radiotherapy use in lung cancer argued that personal experience suggests a high incidence of severe and even lethal radiation pneumonitis in patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis62. In esophageal/GEJ cancer, a careful review of the literature reveals that radiation pneumonitis is uncommon in trial settings . In the CROSS trial, during chemoRT, no instance of pneumonitis was reported. The most common toxicities of any grade that could conceivably involve the thorax or upper abdomen were esophagitis (19%), nausea 25%), and esophageal perforation (1%). Lung toxicit ies of any grade were not reported. Grade 3 -4 events involving these regions were uncommon: esophagitis (1%). Postoperative events, including death, were not increased in the chemoRT plus surgery group, compared to the surgery alone group. In the chemoRT group, the most common postoperative events were pulmonary complications (46%; pneumonia, serious atelectasis, pneumothorax requiring drainage, pleural effusion requiring drainage, pulmonary embol us, or acute respiratory failure defined as partial pressure of arterial O2 <60 mm Hg while breathing room air), cardiac complications (21%; arrhythmia requiring treatment, MI, left ventricular failure as demonstrated by pulmonary edema on radiograph), chl orothorax (10%; elevated levels intraothoracic mediastinitis (3%), anastomotic leak (22%), death in hospital (4%) and death after 30 days (2%). Other phase 3 trials of patients with esophageal/GEJ cancer, all of which used a cis platin/5FU chemotherapy backbone, which is considered to have an unfavorable toxicity profile than MC1541 14 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 carboplatin/paclitaxel, also report low rates of pneumonitis or pulmonary complications (see Table 1 ). Table 1 Thoracic toxicities in phase 3 trials of patients with esophageal or GEJ cancer received concurrent chemoRT (CROSS trial not shown ) Study (no. patients receiving chemoRT) Tumor Chemo regimen RT dose Grade 1 or higher Grade 3 or higher Postop Walsh et al. 1996 (n=58) Distal esoph AC or cardia AC Cisplatin + 5FU Gy Not reported Cardiac NOS n=2 n=14 reported 1% Death due to MI or CVA, 2% Respiratory, none reported No surgery arm a Herskovic et al 1992 (NEJM) is not shown above , because the trial occurred in an earlier era, and because 84% of patients had esophageal SCC; in this trial, severe respiratory toxicities requiring O2 therapy and initiation of glucocorticoid therapy was reported in 3% of patients . b Causes of death included respiratory (n=2) and MI (n=1). Among patients treated with agents targeting CTLA -4 and PD-1, r ates of severe adverse events (G rade 3 -4), including pneumonitis, dyspnea, or cough, have ranged from 2% to 4%10,15,55,65. The agents were believed to contribute to 3 deaths in one study15 and 1 death in another study10. In gastric cancer, the only available data for lung toxicity was reported in KEYNOTE -012, which enrolled only patients with advanced stage21. Of 39 patients who were evaluable for treatment related AEs, G rade 3 -5 treatment related AEs were reported in 1 patient (2.6%) who had Grade 4 pneumoni tis and in 1 patient (2.6%) with hypoxia whose death was considered to be treatment related. In the current trial, a s a precaution to reduce risk for thoracic toxicities and/or postoperative complications following chemoradiation plus pembrolizumab, the following measures have been implemented : Patients aged 69 or more will be excluded (see S ection 3). o The most comprehensive evaluation of the impact of age on the benefit of perioperative chemo(radio)therapy was performed in a meta- analysis (14 randomized controlled trials, N = 2,422) 66. In this analysis, which included individual patient data in the majority of patients, the OS benefit of perioperative therapy was significantly diminished in a stepwise manner as age increased (interaction multivariate P =.0168), with a HR of 1 at ages > 65 years, and HRs >1 observed at ages 70 or more . This lack of benefit in patients with advanced age likely reflects the morbidity associated with trimodality therapy in the setting of subclinical frailty. Radiation parameters used in the CROSS trial on tumor length and radi us, depth, and total RT dose (41.4 Gy) will be implemented. Restrictions from RTOG-1010 on the size of celiac nodes will be implemented (see section 3) . MC1541 15 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Strict limits on normal tissue doses and other aspects of radiation delivery will be mandated per the most updated standard of care and as recommended5 (see section 7.3). On -study rapid -review quality assurance of radiation planning will be mandated . Patients w ith recent serious pulmonary illness will be excluded (see section 3) . PFTs will be required pre -chemoRT and pre- surgery (see section 3) . PFTs are variably utilized but are a standard of care. Monitoring will include late lung toxicities, given that pneumonitis often does not appear until several months after radiation treatment is completed. The combination of pembrolizumab with trimodality therapy is a promising approach in this highly fatal disease. Clinical data are needed that evaluates the combination of pembrolizumab with concurrent radiation to the esophagogastric region , and with concurrent chemotherapy followed by thoracoabdominal surgery. Outcomes for the combination of pembrolizumab and (chemo )radiation are being collected in ongoing trials in other tumor types. Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus concurrent chemoRT: In a neoadjuvant pancreatic cancer trial, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg IV days 1, 22, and 43 will be given during concurrent radiation (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions) and capecitabine (825 mg/m2 BID). Adjuvant pembrolizumab following RT: In head and neck cancer, adjuvant pembrolizumab will be given once every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 doses, following completion of adjuvant 60 Gy radiation (over 6 weeks) and risk- based cisplatin on days 1, 22, and 43. Ongoing or planned studies to assess thoracic RT plus pembrolizumab include: MK-3475 and Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiation in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (NCT02444741) Phase I Trial of MK -3475 and Concurrent Chemo/Radiation for the Elimination of Small Cell Lung Cancer (NCT02 402920) Consolidation Pembrolizumab (MK-3475), Following Chemoradiation in III NSCLC (NCT02343952) In addition, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy (without RT) is currently being studied in multiple solid tumors, including: Phase Ib/II Study - 4aN0M0 Urothelial start May 2015, end March 2018; NCT02365766) Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab for Unresectable Stage (NeoPembroMel; start Jan 2015; end Feb 2017; NCT02306850) A Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Effect of MK -3475 (Pembrolizumab) Therapy on Intratumoral I mmune Renal Cell Cancer (RCC) Patients Undergoing Surgical Resection (start Dec 2014, end Feb 2016; NCT02212730) Immunotherapy With MK -3475 in Locoregionally Advanced, Surgically Resectable Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (start March 2015, end March 2022; NCT02296684) A Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Neoadjuvant MK -3475 (Pembrolizumab) Therapy on Intratumoral Immune Infiltrates in Renal Cell Cancer (RCC) Patients Undergoing Surgical Resection (start Dec 2014, end Feb 2016; NCT02212730) Reported r esults from the above studies will be followed to inform potential modifications, if appropriate, in the current trial. MC1541 16 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 1.8 An accepted outcome measure for this trimodality approach is pathCR A pathologic complete response (pathCR) is defined as the absence of malignant cells in the resected specimen following chemoradiotherapy67. Approximately 15%-29% of patients achieve a pathCR, as shown by a large series from Mayo Clinic and randomized clinical trials2,67-69. PathCR has become accepted as a primary endpoint in phase 2 trials in the US examining the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in this disease, including in NCI- sponsored trials conducted by our group70 and others68,71. This is because the outcome result is known soon (~12 weeks after initiation of therapy) and because it is well- accepted as the strongest prognostic variable for disease- free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS)22,23,72. Pembrolizumab has been shown in preclinical models to enhance antitumor efficacy on primary tumors when added to radiation (see Section 1.6). Together, these considerations support the use of pathCR as an endpoint in the current trial. 1.9a Disease recurrence is an adequate endpoint of long-term outcome after trimodality therapy for GEJ adenocarcinoma Utilizing pathCR as the sole primary endpoint has limitations , particularly for a drug such as pemb rolizumab that may have an abscopal effect on micrometastases that would not be expected for cytotoxic chemoagents. The prior data suggesting pathCR is a surrogate endpoint of long- term survival is based entirely on the use of cytotoxic therapies, not immu notherapies. The benefit from adding pembrolizumab may be demonstrated through its ability to eradicate micrometastases (see Section 1.6); it is possible this effect may not be adequately reflected in the primary tumor in a small single- arm trial. Therefor e, assessing disease recurrence is an important endpoint in the current trial. Disease recurrence is a reasonable surrogate for OS. As described above, ~40 % of patients experience disease recurrence after trimodality therapy. The vast majority of recurrences occur at a distant anatomic site, and 90% of distant recurrences occur within 24 months of completing local therapy. Disease recurrence at a distant anatomic site in esophageal/GEJ adenocarcinoma is almost always fatal. The median OS of patients who ha d distant metastases after trimodality therapy is ~10.2 months 4. In the CROSS trial, after a minimum follow -up of 24 months and a median follow up of 45 months for surviving patients, 35% of patients in the chemoRT group had disease recurrence. Almost all disease recurrences (91% [32%/35%]) included a distant anatomic site. Every recurrence occurred within 36 months after randomization. Moreover, the KM curves (which include only patients who underwent an R0-R2 resection, of adenoca or SCC histology) reveal a DFS rate of 72% at 24 months and 60% at 36 months. The majority (70% [28%/40%]) of DFS events occurred within 24 months. In a large series from a single institution , 40% of patients (144/356) with esophageal/GEJ cancer (85% were GEJ tumors) experienced disease relapse after trimodality therapy after a median follow up of 37 months. Among patients who relapsed, 83% (119 /144) included distant metastases outside the radiation field 4. The distant recurrence rate at 24 months after the completion of local therapy was 31% in the overall cohort; among the patient subset who experienced disease recurrence at a distant site after trimodality therapy, 91% of distant metastases were diagnosed within 2 years of local therapy. 4 A separate report from the same institution observed a locoregional recurrence rate at 24 months of 3.4% (17/518), and these 17 recurrences represented 63% (17/27) of all locoregional recurrences from the time of esophagectomy after a median follow up 55 months for surviving patients 3. Together, these data indicate that 24 months of follow up is sufficient to capture the vast majority of DFS events. MC1541 17 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 1.9b Perioperative chemotherapy alone (without radiotherapy) is an a lternative approach for the definitive treatment of locally advanced GEJ adenocarcinoma While preoperative chemoRT is a preferred approach at leading cancer centers in the U.S. for the treatment of locally advanced GEJ adenocarcinoma, perioperative chemotherapy alone without radiation is a valid approach. Support for perioperative chemotherapy alone without RT for definitive therapy of GEJ adenocarcinoma is based on multiple phase 3 trials utilizing platinum/fluoropyrimidine- based combination chemotherapy, which have shown an OS benefit for the addition of perioperative chemotherapy to surgery alone for esophagogastric cancer73-75. Platin/FP doublet is equal to anthracycline/platin/FP triple (OEO5). In the most recently reported phase 3 trial examining perioperative chemotherapy alone without RT (MRC OEO5, N = 897) , patients with adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus or GEJ were randomized to a standard regimen of 2 cycles of preoperative CF (cisplatin 80 mg/m2, 5FU 1000 mg/m2 D1- 4; once every 21 days) vs an intensified regimen of 4 cycles of preoperative ECX 76. The R0 rates were low: 60% in the CF group vs 67 % in the ECX group. The trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of superior OS in the intensified vs standard r egimen (HR 0.92, p=.89), and toxicity was increased in the intensified regimen. These data are consistent with cross- trial comparisons suggesting that the OS observed with platinum/FP doublets (ACCORD-07)75 are comparable to that with platin/FP /anthracycline triplets (MAGIC)73, and provide support for the use of a platinum/FP doublet as standard therapy for a perioperative approach that utilizes chemotherapy alone without radiation. regimen ( ACCORD-07) A preoperative platin/FP doublet in a recent phase 3 trial involving GEJ adenocarcinoma patients (ACCORD -07), which randomized patients to perioperative chemotherapy vs surgery alone. In this trial 75, 113 patients were assigned to the chemotherapy arm to receive 2 -3 cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 plus 5FU 800 mg/m2/day Days 1-5; every 28 days), followed by 3-4 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy of the same regimen. While 87% of patients received 2 or more cycles preoperatively, only 12% receiv ed 3 preoperative cycles. The R0 rate was 84% (95/113) with a 5 year DFS rate of 34% and 5- year OS rate of 38%. Most common plus cisplatin 80 mg/m2 and 5-FU 800 mg/m2 D1-5, every 21 days, is being examined in patients with previously untreated (KEYNOTE -062) and previously treated (KEYNOTE- 059) patients with GEJ/gastric cancer. Lack of efficacy benefit from the addi tion of perioperative cisplatin/5FU to surgery alone in US population (INT -0113) However, the combination of cisplatin plus 5 -FU is not widely used as preoperative regimen in the U.S. This is partly due to the observed toxicity in this population. In addition, this regimen (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 plus 5FU 1000 mg/m2 days 1 -5, every 28 days) demonstrated a lack of efficacy in the largest U.S. randomized trial examining perioperative chemotherapy plus surgery vs surgery alone (INT -0113) 77,78. In this trial (N = 467), R0 rates were observed in 63% in the perioperative chemother apy group, comparable to the R0 rates observed in the CF arm of the recent OEO5 trial, vs 59% in the surgery alone group. Only patients with an R0 resection experienced substantial long- term survival, which is a well -recognized prognostic factor. After med ian follow up of 8.8 years, median OS was the same between groups (1.3 years in CF -surgery group vs 1.3 years in the surgery alone group ). Combination of oxaliplatin /5FU with colorectal cancer cells, an anti -mouse PD- L1 antibody was recently shown to significantly improve survival of mice. The antitumor activity of anti- PD-L1 was MC1541 18 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 enhanced by combination with oxaliplatin, which resulted in increased release of HMGB1 within CT26 tumors81. Pembrolizumab is being tested in combination with mFOLFOX6 in a phase 2 trial of advanced CRC (NCT02375672) and in a phase I (dose escalation)/II adva nced GI malignancies, including gastroesophageal carcinomas (NCT02268825). In the former trial, pembrolizumab is administered 200 mg IV (flat dose) every 3 weeks, starting with cycle 1, with FOLFOX being given every 2 weeks. In the latter trial, pembrolizu mab is administered every 2 weeks, starting with cycle 3, with FOLFOX given every 2 weeks (Level -1: 50mg IV q 2 weeks Level 1: 75mg IV q 2 weeks Level 2: 200mg IV q 2 weeks). Combination of carboplatin/ paclitaxel with pembrolizumab The carboplatin/paclit axel doublet has known activity in GEJ cancer in locally advanced disease 2 and in advanced disease in the first -line82-85 and second- line86,87 settings. Paclitaxel or platinum compounds have demonstrated improved antitumor efficacy when combined with anti -PD-1-based blockade88. Carbo pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg (all agents given on Day 1 of a 21- day cycle) is currently being tested in a phase I/II trial in metastatic NSCLC (KEYNOTE cancer and anti including MSI, EBV, and PDL1 and PDL2 amplification. Recent comprehensive molecular characterization of GEJ/gastric adenocarcinomas by the TCGA has revealed 4 molecular subtypes : EBV - associated (10% of cases, which included and amplifications), microsatellite unstable (MSI histology, -RAS CDH1, -associated gastric adenocarcinomas display PD - L1 and PD -L289 and are primarily characterized by dysregulation of immune response genes90. In addition, EBV ISH- positivity was found to be correlated with PDL1 protein expression in a large series of human gastric cancers from China54, and EBV infection was strongly associated with intratumoral CD8+ T cell infiltration and moderately correlated to stromal CD8+ T cell accumulation in a small gastric cancer series91. EBV positivity by ISH was found in 3% of gastric cancers from Caucasians (N>400)92. This association has not been studied extensively in GEJ adenocarcinomas. The association between MSI (mismatch repair [MMR ] deficiency) and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is well established in multiple epithelial cancers. A recent phase 2 study evaluated the clinical activity of pembrolizumab in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without deficient MMR. Pembrolizumab was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 14 days in patients with MMR -deficient cancer (CRC) co-primary end points were the immune -related objective response rate (irORR) and the 20 -week immune- related progression -free survival rate (irPFS). The irORR and irPFS rate were 40% (4 of 10 patients) and 78% (7 of 9 patients), respectively, for MMR-deficient CRC s; and 0% (0 of 18 patients) and 11% (2 of 18 patients) for MMR- proficient CRC s; and 71% (5 of 7) (4 6) for MMR-deficient non- CRC canc ers. Median PFS reached in MMR -deficient CRCs, MC1541 19 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 but were 2.2 and 5.0 months, respectively, in MMR- proficient CRCs (HR for disease progression or death, 0.10 [ P <.001], and HR for death, 0.22 [ P =.05]). Whole- exome sequencing revealed a mean of 1782 somatic mutations per tumor in MMR -deficient tumors, as compared with 73 in MMR -proficient tumors ( P =.007), and high somatic mutation loads were associated with prolonged PFS93. The largest evaluation of MMR in gastric/GEJ cancer (N = 712) revealed that 9% of tumors from either a European (25 of 264) or Japan cohort (21 of 230) were MMR -deficient94. KRAS mutation (codons 12, 13, and 61) was detected in ~5% of tumors, and BRAFV600E mutation was detected in <1% of tumors. KRAS mutation status was statistically positively correlated with MMR -deficiency. The MMR rate among 446 ga stric tumors from Caucasians was reported to be 7%92. MSI data are recently available on the Foundation One genomic profile , which also provides information on alterations in hundreds of cancer -related genes and mutational load (FoundationOne.com ). This test is commercially available and has been obtained as part of clinical care in Mayo Clinic patients to facilitate treatment options. 1.9c2 Tissue expression of PDL1 and immune markers PDL1 expression is an important marker that has potential predictive value for pembrolizumab therapy , as described above. Ionizing radiation has been shown to induce PDL1 expression in preclinical models, as described above39,40. The density of markers of adaptive immunity such as CD3, CD8, FoxP3, and CD45RO infiltrating intratumoral/stromal tissue compartments have been associated with survival in patients with colorectal cancer, as we95 and others96,97 have shown. In gastric cancer, the densities of CD3+, CD8+, and CD45RO+ TILs were independent favorable prognost ic factors 98, as were CD8+ and FoxP3+ cells in MSI -high g astric cancers99. The percentages of CD8+ T cells that produce IL- 17 in gastric tumors are associated with survival times of patients and promote chemotaxis of MDSCs, which might promote tumor progression100. It is possible that adaptive immune markers in TILs, apart from PD -L1 expression, can have predictive value for immunomodulating agents101. 1.9c3 Circulating markers and cells Soluble PD -L1. Release of inhibitory coregulatory proteins into the circulation may represent one mechanism by which tumors thwart immune responses. A collaborator in the current trial ( Laboratory ) identifie d a soluble form of PD -L1 that retains immunosuppressive activity and is associated with aggressive renal cell carcinoma 102. This lab developed an ELISA for quantification of PD-L1 in biological fluids. Soluble PD- L1 was detected in the cell supernatants of some PD -L1-positive tumor cell lines. Protein sequencing established that the measured soluble PD -L1 retained its receptor -binding domain and could deliver proapoptotic signals to T cells. Higher preoperative so luble PD-L1 levels were asso ciated with larger tumors ( P < .001), tumors of advanced stage ( P =.017) and grade ( P =.044), and tumors with necrosis ( P =.003). A doubling of soluble PD -L1 levels was associated with a 41% increased risk of death ( P =.010). These observations suggest that soluble PD -L1 may be detected in the sera of cancer patients and that it may systemically impair host immunity, thereby fostering cancer progression and subsequent poor clinical outcome. MC1541 20 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Soluble PD -L1 has not been tested in GE J cancer patients, nor have changes in levels in response to neoadjuvant chemoRT been adequately studied. Balance of circulating CD8+ effector cell subpopulation. Given that the antigen spectrum for a given tumor is usually incomplete , it is possible that neo antigens could be generated and released from tumor cells following RT, which would not be identified by commercially available tetramers. Since the establishment of antigen specificity for the entire T -cell population is not possible, this study will ascertain whether the antigen burst and/or inflammatory factors released following RT would selectively expand or reduc e T cell subpopulation. While RT-induced changes are init iated locally at tumor sites, RT can impact the systemic immune system as observ ed in the abscopal effect. We hypothesize that tumor antigens and/or inflammatory factors released from RT -induced tumor cell necrosis will trigger an efflux of effector or memory T cells in the peripheral blood since these subpopulation of T cells are ant igen-primed and may have a rapid response to altered antigen stimulation in context with inflammatory cytokines. It has been reported that RT increases the serum levels of IL -1beta and IL-6 and reduces the serum levels of TGF -beta in prostate cancer patients after 1 - 2 weeks of RT. Among the cytokines, IL-6 is responsible for expansion of effector memory CD8 + T cells and IL -1beta and TGF -beta regulate the transmigration or tissue retention of effector and memory CD8+ T cells. In this portion of the project, f luctuations in frequencies among na\u00efve (CCR7+CD45RA+), central memory (CCR7+CD45RA-), effector/effector memory (CCR7-CD45RA-), and terminally differentiated (CCR7-CD45RA+) CD8+ T cells will be determined and evaluated together with the development of anti-gastric cancer immunity in relation to the timing of RT. PBMCs and plasma will be isolated at (baseline), after RT ( day 1, 8, 15, pre- surgery), after adjuvant therapy, and at tumor recurrence. Cells will be co -stained with antibodies for CD3, CD8, CD45RA, CCR7 to identify CD8+ T cells and their phenotype. The percentage of each subset will be determined based on the total CD8+ T cells when analyzed by flow cytometry. We will compare the frequency of each subset of CD8 +T cells and their PD -1 expression in relation to the diff erent time points following RT . If we identify any significant changes of T cell subset, we will measure the cytokine profiles of these patients at that time point using multiplex methods. Tumor- reactive CD11ahighPD-1high CD8+ T effect or population following RT. T cell receptor (TCR) tetramers can detect tumor -specific immunity but have limitations. Both the down regulation of the TCR induced by persistent tumor antigen encounter and the weak affinity of CD8+ T cells for tumor antigens contribute to the underestimation of anti- tumor responses measured by tetramers. In addition, TCR tetramers are not capable of detecting CD8+ T cell responses to subdominant epitopes. Therefore, a novel method of detecting tumor- related T cell response is necessary in situations where the identity of tumor antigens are unknown or suboptimal to be detected by tetramers. CD11a expression is required in the rejection of tumors103. A collaborator laboratory recently established that the CD11ahigh PD-1+ T cell population represent tumor- reactive CD8+ T cells104. In addition, work from this lab determined that CD11ahighCD8+ T cells inside tumors are tumor- specific functional effector cells and that their function is enhanced by stereotactic ablative radiotherapy in PD -1 knockout mice105. In the current study, we propose to investigate whether the CD11ahigh PD-1+ CD8+ T cell population in GEJ cancer patients following the MC1541 21 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 initiation of chemoRT plus pembrolizumab can identify tumor- related T cell response. PBMCs and plasma will be isolated at (baseline), after RT (day 1, 8, 15, pre- surgery), after adjuvant therapy, and at tumor recurrence and will be used in the following assa ys: T cell activation marker assay PD -1+ CD11ahigh CD8+ T cells will for CD69, CD25, CD45RO and CD62L which are upregulated upon T cell activation. T cell proliferation assay The proliferation of PD-1+ CD11ahigh CD8+ T cells will be measured by their larger forward light scatter (FSC) and intranuclear expression of Ki67. T cell differentiation assay The expression of transcription factors that controls T cell differentiation into effector or memory cells will be analyzed. W e will measure the levels of T -bet (for effector T cells) and Eomes (for memory T cells) in PD -1 + CD11ahigh CD8+ T cells. T cell cell effector functions of CD11a high PD-1+ CD8+ T cells will be assessed by measuring degranulation (CD107a expression) and intracellular production of IFN- gamma following a 4-hour ex vivo stimulation with PMA/ionomycin or with any known prostate antigen peptides. The expression of effector molecule of CTL (granzyme B) and its inducer transcription factors (Bcl6 and Runx3), will be examined in PD-1 + CD11ahigh CD8+ T cells. Circulating MDSCs and immune profile Recent evidence indicates that circulating myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) may be increased in gastrointestinal tumors and other cancers, and these cells may correlate with increased response of melanoma patients to ipilumimab. The tumor microenvironment is populated by various types of inhibitory immune cells including Tregs, alternatively activated macrophages, and myeloid- derived suppression cells (MDSCs), which suppress T cell activation and promote tumor outgrowth 106. Recent studies indicate that MDSCs also play an essential role in chemoresistance and radiores istance107. Therapeutic blockade of immune checkpoints has been associated with a r eversal in the distribution and proportion of MDSCs108,109. In addition, a reduction in circulating MDSCs was associated with regression of metastatic tumors in a melanoma patient treated with ipilimumab and radiotherapy29. On day 10 after ionizing radiation, Deng et al observed that MDSCs, defined by CD45+CD11b+Gr1+ expression, were reduced by IR and/or anti-PD -L140. In tumors that received anti -PD-L1 or IR treatment alone, the percentage of MDSCs in the total CD45+ cell population decreased from 19% in untreated tumors to 7% ( P =.016) and ( therapy with anti-PD -L1 and IR exhibited the greatest effect on MDSCs and further reduced the percentage to 0. 4% of total CD45+ cells ( P <.0001 ). The extent of local reduction in MDSCs was associated with enhanced tumor growth delay and tumor regression, and were dependent on CD8+ T cells . These results raise the possibility that a local reduction in MDSCs is an essential component in the therapeutic efficacy of combination treatment with local IR and anti-PD -L1. Other data from this study suggest that CD8+ cells are directly involved in controlling MDSC cells by inducing apoptosis of MDSCs, and that RT and anti- PD-L1 combination therapy restores the function of CD8+ T cells, which, in turn, results in the direct elimination of MDSC s. MC1541 22 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 A collaborating laboratory ( ) recently developed a method that allows the analysis of human leukocyte populations, including MDSCs, by the use of eight 10-color flow cytometric protocols in combination with novel software analysis110. This method is distinct from, and complementary to, the analysis to be com pleted by the Dong/Kwon Lab described above, by utilizing un-manipulated biological sample preparation that allows for comprehensive direct quantitation of leukocytes and non-overlapping immunophenotypes. This group specifically designed myeloid protocols that enable the identification of distinct phenotypes that include mature monocytes, granulocytes, circulating dendritic cells, immature myeloid cells, and MDSCs. This method also identified CD123 as an additional distinguishing marker for the phenotypic c haracterization of immature LIN -CD33+HLADR -MDSCs. This approach permits the comprehensive analysis of all peripheral blood leukocytes and yields data that is highly amenable for standardization across inter- laboratory comparisons for human studies. 1.9d P roposed Trial : Study Overview This is a single-arm Phase 1b/2 study. Patients with resectable, locally advanced, GEJ/gastric cardia adenocarcinoma will be treated and paclitaxel, and conc urrent daily radiotherapy for approximately 5 weeks. Pembrolizumab will be administered once every 3 weeks for up to 3 preoperative doses. Within 4 to 8 weeks following completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, a PET/CT scan will be performed to rule out distant disease. If dist ant disease is not confirmed, patients will undergo curative-intent surgery to remove the tumor within 4 to 8 weeks following completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Following surgery, after all acute toxicities in the postoperative period have resolv ed to grade 1 or less, patients will receive adjuvant pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks for up to 6 doses. In the phase 1b portion, 15 evaluable patients will be enrolled. Toxicity and safety will be actively monitored on an ongoing basis. Enrollment will b e halted after the 15 th patient to assess for safety. If safety parameters fail to be met (see Section 16 for details of safety criteria) , data will be analyzed to determine the specific nature and etiologies of safety concerns. We anticipate that safety parameters will be met, in which case the study will move onto the Phase 2 portion. In the phase 2 portion, 30 evaluable patients will be enrolled and will receive the same neoadjuvant regimen and surgery as in the Phase 1b portion. These 30 patients will include patients who already received this treatment in the Phase 1b portion. It is possible that the neoadjuvant regimen is a modified regimen. After pembrolizumab is permanently discontinued, patients will be evaluated with history, physical exam, and imaging every 3 months for the 1st year after surgery, then every 4 months for the 2nd year. Diagnostic investigations will be performed only when recurrence is suspected. Patients will be followed for disease recurrence and overall survival up to 2 years after surgery. If the primary endpoint is met (ie, pathCR see Section 16 ), future plans include expanding to a larger single-arm or randomized Phase 2, or to a Phase 3 trial, that may include a biomarker -selected population. MC1541 23 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Potential \"pseudoprogression\" at the time of repeat PET /CT In the phase 1b or 2 portion of the trial, repeat PET/ CT following the completion of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab/chemoRT may detect new lesions at distant anatomic sites, or demonstrate that the primary has enlarged or that regional lymph nodes have increased in size or number. While these instances are expected to be uncommon, i t will be challenging to confirm whether these changes are due to worsening disease vs pseudoprogression. This is be cause 10% or more of patients receiving immunotherapy are characterized as having PD using traditional (WHO) criteria, but then have subsequent evidence of tumor response111. In addition, 4-7% of patients (7 of 180 in CROSS2; 16 of 128 in Burmeister et al112) assigned to standard chemoRT without immunotherapy experience PD prior to surgery, such that surgery is not possible. Symptomatology is often an unreliable indicator of PD due to the confounding effects of chemoRT-induced esophagitis which can worsen swallowing and other symptoms. Given the complexity and infrequency of these situations, these cases will be addressed on an individual basis, and management will depend on the specific clinical scenario with final decision -making resting in the clinical judgment of the investigative team. The team will undertake multidisciplinary discussions and apply the principles of irRECIST adapted to trimodality therapy in GEJ cancers. According to irRECIST113-115 or irRC (immune related response criteria)111, new lesions or lesions that show interval enlargement must be confirmed on repeat imaging that is completed 4 or more weeks later, in order to determine the changes as PD. If new lesions or other radiographic changes are observed during or immediately after chemoRT, or at the time of repeat PET/ CT, in the absence of signs or symptoms of definitive unresectable disease, options include: delaying surgery while continuing systemic therapy followed by repeat imaging; proceeding directly to surgery which may be preceded by intraoperative confirmation of resectability; or obtaining tissue confirmation of a new lesion. Given the unreliability of radiographic changes of the primary tumor during or after che moRT, due to the inflammatory effects of chemoRT on tissue, assessment of PD will not routinely include changes in the primary tumor or regional nodes, as long as the disease remains resectable. If surgery is delayed, the investigators will have the optio n of continuing pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy (without RT), followed by repeat imaging 4 or more weeks later. The recommended chemotherapy backbone will be continuation of carboplatin plus paclitaxel (see Section 1.9b for rationale; see Sectio n 7 for details of therapy) . After completing at least two cycles, repeat imaging will be performed.

The planning CT should encompass the chest and abdomen (from the mid- cervical spine to the iliac crests). This should include all of the lungs and all of both kidneys for calculating dose- volume histograms (DVHs) for these organs. Use of 4 dimensional CT (4DCT) is strongly recommended to characterize organ motion. Oral or IV contrast (if no contr aindications) should be considered to aid in target/normal tissue delineation. Breath hold treatment can be considered if the tumor involves the stomach. The planning CT will be registered with the diagnostic PET/CT for aiding in target delineation. Daily verification of the treatment setup will be performed with kilovoltage xray images or volumetric imaging (kilovoltage Amendment perform ance status (see Section 4.0 ). See Section 7.37 for recommendations for supportive care during radiation therapy. 7.36 Treatment interruptions Treatment interruptions should be minimized through the use of supportive car e measures (see Section 7.38). Interruptions for life- threatening adverse events (CTCAE G rade 4) are allowed. 7.37 Supportive care during radiation therapy Significant nutritional compromise may occur during radiation and chemotherapy for esophageal cancer. Esophagitis, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia can all contribute to this issue. Antiemetics such as prochlorpherazine (Compazine \u00ae), ondansetron, or granisetron should be used, as needed, to ma nage treatment related nausea. The use of concurrent lorazepam (0.5 to 1.0 mg) with prochlorperazine can be beneficial. Esophageal pain can be mitigated with liquid acetaminophen and narcotic analgesics. Aggressive management of nutritional problems during treatment should be considered. Consultation with a professional dietitian is appropriate and encouraged. Consideration of a feeding tube should be considered in patients who are unable to maintain adequate nutrition during treatment with radiation and chemotherapy. Some surgeons prefer placement of the feeding tube in the jejunum (PEJ) rather than in the stomach (PEG) with regard to issues of surgical reconstruction of the stomach after resection of the pri mary lesion. A nasogastric feeding tube is also acceptable. 7.4 S urgery 7.41 Timing of Surg ery Surgery to remove the primary cancer should occur no earlier than 24 days after the last dose of neoadjuvant pembro lizumab . In addition, although clinical judgment is necessary to determine the precise timing of surgery, it is generally encouraged for surgery to occur 5 to 8 weeks after the last dose of RT. For patients assigned to receive a neoadjuvant regimen that consists of chemotherapy alone (ie, no RT), surgery is encouraged to occur 3 to 6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy. 7.42 Surgeon Experience Individual s urgeons must have performed a minimum of 50 surgeries of the surgery type that is planned: ie, 50 minimally invasive esophagectomy [MIE] 50 other [eg, 3 -hole or McKweon] if other is planned. Any issues regarding surgeon involvement in the study may be reviewed by the study team.

These AEs may occur shortly after the first dose or several mo nths after the last dose of treatment. Pembrolizumab must be withhe ld for drug- related toxicities and severe or life- threatening AEs as per the Table below. See Section 9.0 and Appendix VI for supportive care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids.

Otherwise dosing will be held until symptoms res olve and the subject should be premedicated for the next scheduled dose. c Patients with intolerable or persistent Grade 2 drug -related AE may hold study medication at physician discretion. Permanently discontinue study drug for persistent Grade 2 adverse reactions for which treatment with study drug has been held, that do not recover to Grade 0-1 within 12 weeks of the last dose. 8.22 Other instructions for pembrolizumab If pembrolizumab- related toxicity does not resolve to Grade 0-1 within 12 weeks after last administration of study drug, study therapy discontinuation is recommended. With Investigator agreement, patients with a laboratory adverse event still at Grade 2 may continue in the study only if asymptomatic and controlled. In patients who continue on study therapy after experiencing an Adverse Event warranting potential d ose modification, if considered drug- related by the investigator, once the patient has recovered to Grade 0 -1 the dosing interval in subsequent cycles will be increased by 1 week (e.g., to 3 weeks in patients who were on an every 2 -week schedule). Following each such dose delay due to toxicity, the dosing interval should increase by an additional week. For example, patients who began the study on a 3 -week dosing schedule, and have stopped MC1541 47 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 drug twice for due to a drug- related toxicity that meets the above criteria, should now be dosing every 5 weeks. For patients who experience a recurrence of the same severe AEs listed above with rechallenge of pembrolizumab, a consultation with the Investigator will occur to determine whether the patient should continue in the study. A patient who experiences the same SAE of the same NCI CTCAE grade or higher with rechallenge of pembrolizumab must discontinue pembrolizumab immediately. Reduced dose of pembrolizumab dose (ie, below 200 mg) will not be administered. 8.3 Dose modifications for carboplatin and paclitaxel 8.31 Suggested dose levels for carboplatin and paclitaxel * Dose Level only NOTE: If carboplatin or paclitaxel is discontinued, or reduced to dose level -3, the investigator may choose to replace the chemotherapy with FOLFOX, capecitabine (with or without oxaliplatin), or 5FU infusion. 8.32 Guidelines for c arboplatin and paclitaxel table of events and modifications CTCAE System/Organ/Class (SOC) ADVERSE EVENT AGENTa ACTION Blood and lymphatic disorders Febrile neutropenia (fever without clinically or microbiologically X 109 C/L] fever 38.5oC) carboplatin paclitaxel Delay chemotherapy by 1 week until ANC recovers to Grade 0 -2 and until fever resolves.

This includes blood product support, antibiotic treatment, and treatment of other newly diagnosed or concurrent medical conditions. All blood products and concomitant medications such as antidiarrheals, analgesics, and/or antiemetics received from the first day of study treatment administration until 30 days after the final dose will be recorded in the medical records. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti - inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be rela ted to pembrolizumab. Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). Refer to Section 8.2 for dose modification. It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event. 9.2 Immunotherapy- related toxicities Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immunotherapy- related toxicities, which include but are not limited to the following: Pneumonitis o For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. o For Grade 3 -4 events, immediately trea t with intravenous steroids. Administer additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed. o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged steroid administration. Diarrhea/colitis Patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). o All patients who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink l iberal quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis. MC1541 53 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 o For Gra de 2 diarrhea/colitis, administer oral corticosteroids. o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis, treat with intravenous steroids followed by high dose oral steroids. o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (if new onset , including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] ) or Grade (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis (DKA) For T1DM or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia: o Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria. o Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide. Hypophysitis o For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. o For Grade 3-4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. o Grade 2 hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2-4 hypothyroidism): In hyperthyroidism, non- selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) are suggested as initial therapy. In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care. o Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve t o Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. Hepatic o For Grade 2 events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until r eturned to baseline values (consider weekly). Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours. o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. MC1541 54 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Renal failure or nephritis o For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids. o For Grade 3 -4 events, t reat with systemic corticosteroids. o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 9.3 Blood products and growth factors Blood products and growth factors should be utilized as clinically warranted and following institutional policies and recommendations. The use of growth factors should follow published guideline s of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 24, No 18 (June 20), 2006: pp. 2932-2947. Neutropenia Prophylactic use of colony- Granulocyte Colony - Stimulating Factor (G -CSF), pegylated G- CSF or Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-S timulating Factor GM -CSF is not allowed in this study. Therapeutic use of G- CSF is allowed in patients with Grade 3 -4 febrile neutropenia. 9.32 Anemia Transfusions and/or erythropoietin may be utilized as clinically indicated for the treatment of anemia, but should be clearly noted as concurrent medications. 9.33 Thrombocytopenia Transfusion of platelets may be used if clinically indicated. ITP should be ruled out before initiation of platelet transfusion. 9.4 Anti-infectives Patients with a documented infectious complication should receive oral or IV antibiotics or other anti -infective agents as considered appropriate by the treating Investigator for a given infectious condition, according to standard institutional practice. 9.5 Corticosteroids Patients req uiring chronic steroid administration (excluding inhaled steroids ).are excluded from the trial. Patients may continue on inhalation therapy. Corticosteroids are known immunosuppressive agents that can mitigate the effects of pembrolizumab. Steroids should be generally reserved to treat side effects of pembrolizumab. Steroids can be used as primary prevention of nausea per institutional guidelines, but steroid doses should be reduced in subsequent cycles if nausea/vomiting is absent or very m ild (see Section 9.5). 9.6 Antiemetics Antiemetics may be used at the discretion of the attending physician. Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and consideration should be given to the administration of prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to standard institutional practice. Patients should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake. Volume depletion should be corrected before initiation of study drug. If no or minimal nausea/vomiting is reported after first dose of carboplatin/paclitaxel, investigators are strongly encouraged to reduce the dose of dexamethasone to 10 mg as pre-treatment anti -emetic dosing at time of next dose . In addition, if nausea/vomiting continues to be a minimal issue, investigators are stron gly encouraged to progressively decrease the pre- treatment dose of dexamethasone in subsequent doses ( ie, 4 mg or zero). If the investigator believes a stronger dose is needed, then s/he may manually increase the dexamethasone dose. MC1541 55 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 9.7 Anti-diarrheals Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). In symptomatic patients, infectious etiologi es should be ruled out, and if symptoms are persistent and/or severe, endoscopic evaluation should be considered. (See Section 9.7 for management of treatment -related enterocolitis) All patients who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. NOTE: Loperamide/diphenoxylate/atropines should NOT be used for diarrhea symptoms unless: (1) it is believed that pembrolizumab- related enterocolitis is unlikely to be present after detailed evaluation by gastroenterology, including endoscopy; PLUS (2) approval is documented by a gastroenterology specialist. 9.8 Management of treatment related enterocolitis In patients wit h severe enterocolitis, pembrolizumab will be held and treatment with systemic corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, corticosteroid taper should be started a nd continued over at least 1 month. In patients with moderate enterocolitis, pembrolizumab should be withheld and antidiarrheal treatment should be started. If symptoms are persistent for more than one week, systemic corticosteroids should be initiated (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent). When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, corticosteroid taper should be started and continued over at least 1 month. 9.9a Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (Allowed & Prohibited) Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the ongoing tr ial. If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required. The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the patient's primary physician. 9.9a1 Acceptable Concomitant Medications All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject's welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of medical care. All concomitant medication will be recorded in the case report form s (CRF) including all prescription, over-the- counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids. If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. All concomitant medications received within 28 days before the first dose of trial treatment and 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded. Concomitant medications administered 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 10 and Appendix VI. 9.9a2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications The following medications are not permitted during t he screening and treatment phase (including retreatment for post- complete response relapse) of this trial: Anti-neoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol MC1541 56 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow and typhoid vaccine. Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the principal investigator. Patients who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the tria l. Patients may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary. The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial. There are no prohibited therapies during the Post-Treatment Follow-up Phase. 9.9b Infusion Reaction Table 9. 9a Infusion Reaction Treatment Guidelines NCI CTCAE Grade Treatment Premedication at subsequent dosing Grade 1 Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated Increase monitoring of vital signs as medically indicated until the subject is deemed medically stable in the opinion of the investigator. None Grade 2 Requires infusion interruption but responds promptly to symptomatic treatment (e.g., antihistamines, NSAIDS, narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for 24 hrs Stop Infusion and monitor symptoms. Additional appropriate medical therapy may include but is not limited to: IV fluids Antihistamines NSAIDS Acetaminophen Narcotics Increase monitoring of vital signs as medically indicated until the subject is deemed medically stable in the opinion of the investigator. If symptoms resolve within one hour of stopping treatment infusion, the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the original infusion rate (e.g., from 100 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr). Otherwise dosing will be held until symptoms resolve and the subject should be premedicated for the next scheduled dose. Patients who develop Grade 2 toxicity despite adequate premedication should be permanently discontinued from further trial treatment administration. Subject may be premedicated 1.5h (\u00b1 30 minutes) prior to infusion of pembrolizumab with: Diphenhydramine 50 mg po (or equivalent dose of antihistamine). Acetaminophen 500-1000 mg po (or equivalent dose of antipyretic).

Hospitalization may be indicated. Subject is permanently discontinued from further trial trea tment administration. No subsequent dosing Appropriate resuscitation equipment should be available in the room and a physician readily available during the period of study treatment administration. 9.9c Contraception Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Furthermore, it is not known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm. For this trial, male patients will be considered to be of non- reproductive potential if they have azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition). Female patients will be considered of non- reproductive potential if they are either: (1) po stmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause; in women <45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post- menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.); OR (2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, at le ast 6 weeks prior to screening; OR (3) has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing. Female and male patients of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or impregnating a partner, respec tively, while receiving study drug and for 120 days after the last dose of study drug by complying with one of the following: MC1541 58 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 (1) practice abstinen ce from heterosexual activity; OR (2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heter osexual activity. Acceptable methods of contraception are: Single method (one of the following is acceptable): intrauterine device (IUD) vasectomy of a female subject's male partner contraceptive rod implanted into the skin Combination method (requires use of two of the following): diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical cap/spermicide) cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only) contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only) male condom or female condom (cannot be used together) hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pill (estrogen/progestin pill or progestin- only pill), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive injection Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject's preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and ERCs/IRBs. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calend ar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable metho d of contraception for patients participating at sites in this country/region. Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to partic ipate in the study patients of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose of trial therapy. If there is any question that a patient of childbearing potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that patient should not be entered into the study. 9.9d Use in Pregnancy If a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab, the patient will immediately be removed from the study. The site will contact the patient at least monthly and document the patient's status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to Mayo Clinic and to Merck without delay and within 24 hours to Mayo Clinic and within 2 working days to Merck if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn). The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn. If a male subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed MC1541 59 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 immediately and the pregnancy reported to Mayo Clinic and to Merck and followed as described above. 9.9e Use in Nursing Women Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, patients who are breast -feeding are not eligible for enrollment. Specific additional information follows for individual agents used in this trial. 9.9e1 Pembrolizumab It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk. 9.9e2 Cisplatin Cisplatin has been reported to be found in human milk; patients receiving Cisplatin injection should not breast -feed. 9.9e3 Fluorouracil It is not known whether 5- fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because 5 - fluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not nurse while receiving this treatment. MC1541 61 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE) Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects 10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 be downloaded from the CTEP web: (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm ) 10.11 Adverse event monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. First, id entify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0. Next, determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2) and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see Section 10.3). With this i nformation, determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report (see Section 10.4). Expedited reports are to be completed within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in Sections 10.4. All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the routine data reporting mechanisms defined by the protocol (see Sections 10.5 and 18.0). 10.12 Each CTCAE term in the current version is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical documentation and scientific analysis and is a single MedDRA Lowest Level Term (LLT). NOTE : A severe AE, as defined by the above grading scale, is NOT the same as serious AE, which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Events The determination of whether an AE i s expected is based on agent -specific information provided in Section 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, Appendix II, and Appendix III of the protocol. Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent -specific information provided in Section 15. 1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, Appendix II, and Appendix III of the protocol. NOTE : \"Unexpected adverse experiences\" means any adverse experience that is not identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information provided for IRB review nor mentioned in the conse nt for m. NOTE : The consent form may contain study specific information at the discretion of the Principal Investigator; it is possible that this information may NOT be included in the protocol or the investigator brochure. 10.3 Assessment of Attribution When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s). Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s). Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s). MC1541 62 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s). Events determined to be possibly, probably or d efinitely attributed to a medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. 10.31 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial Agent(s) on the SAME Arm NOTE: The combination of an investigational agent with a commercial agent is considered investigational. Routine Reporting Routine AE reporting for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies using an investigational agent /intervention in combination with a commercial agent is stated in the protocol. See Section 10.52. NOTE: When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same treatment arm as the investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, cellular product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire combination (arm) is then considered an investigational intervention for reporting. Expedited Reporting An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with the guidelines for CTEP investigational agents/interventi ons in Section 10.4, and where indicated, an expedited report must be submitted. An AE that occurs prior to administration of the investigational agent/intervention must be assessed as specified in the protocol. In general, only Grade 4 and 5 AEs that are unexpected with at least possible attribution to the commercial agent require an expedited report. Refer to Section 10.4 for specific AE reporting requirements or exceptions. Commercial agent expedited reports must be submitted to the FDA via MedWatch. An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated with a commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) occurs with a higher degree of severity, expedited reporting is required. The clinical investig ator must determine severity. 10.32 Special Situations for Expedited Reporting and Submission of Notification Forms Exceptions to Expedited Reporting and Submission of Notification Forms: EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events 1 An expedited report or notification form may not be required for specific Grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 Serious Adverse Events where the AE is listed in Section 15.0 of the protocol or the consent form* as EXPECTED. Any protocol specific reporting procedures MUST BE SPECIFIED BELOW and will super cede the standard Expedited Adverse Event Reporting and Notification Form Requirements (Note: These adverse events must still be reported through the routine reporting mechanism [i.e. Nadir/Adverse Events Form]; see F ootnote 1): MC1541 63 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 System Organ Class (SOC) Adverse event/ Symptoms CTCAE Grade at which the event will not be expeditedly reported1 General disorders and administrations site conditions Fatigue Grade 3 Gastrointestinal Vomiting Grade 3 Nausea Grade 3 Diarrhea Grade 3 Investigations Neutrophil count decreased Grade 3 or 4 White blood cell count decreased Grade 3 or 4 Lymphocyte count decreased Grade 3 or 4 Platelet count decreased Grade 3 or 4 Blood and lymphatic system disorders Anemia Grade 3 or 4 1These exceptions only apply if the adverse event does not result in hospitalization. If the adverse event results in hospitalization, then the standard expedited adverse events reporting requirements must be followed. NOTE: Hospitalization related to convenience (e.g. transport tation issues, etc.) will not be considered an SAE for purposes of reporting to Merck. Specific protocol exceptions to expedited reporting should be reported expedi-tiously by investigators ONLY if they exceed the expected grade of the event. Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to Merck, unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event. Any such event will be submitted to the Sponsor (Mayo Clinic) within 24 hours and to Merck Global Safety within 2 working days either by electronic or paper media. Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is disease progression of the cancer under study. The Sponsor will monitor unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to ensure the safety of the subjects in the trial. Any suspected endpoint which upon review is not progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to Merck Global Safety as a SAE within 2 working days of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under study. 10.321 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), congenital abnormities or birth defects, must be reported immediately if they occur at any time following treatment with an agent under an IND/IDE since they are considered to be a serious AE and must be reported to the sponsor as specified in 21 CFR 312.64(b). 10.322 Death Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24 -hours. MC1541 64 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours. Reportable categories of Death Death attributable to a CTC AE term. Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by cessation of life during the first 28 days of life. Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or wit hin one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 \"Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) - Other (Progressive Disease)\" under the system organ class (SOC) of the same name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted. Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours. Any death occurring greater than 30 days after the last does of the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational agent/intervention. 10.323 Secondary Malignancy A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an IND/IDE be reported. Three options are available to describe the event: Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML]) Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) Treatment -related secondary malignancy Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. MC1541 67 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 10.52 Submit via appropriate MCCC Case Report Forms (i.e., paper or electronic, as applicable) the following AEs experienced by a patient and not specified in Section 10.5: 10.521 Grade 2 AEs deemed possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study treatment or procedure. 10.522 Grade 3 and 4 AEs regardless of attribution to the study treatment or procedure. 10.523 Grade 5 AEs (Deaths) 10.5231 Any death within 30 days of the patient's last study treatment or procedure regardless of attribution to the study treatment or procedure. 10.5232 Any death more than 30 days after the patient's last study treatment or procedure that is felt to be at least possibly treatment related must also be submitted as a Grade 5 AE, with a CTCAE type and attribution assigned. 10.524 Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs) ECIs are selected non -serious and serious adverse experiences that must be reported within 24 hours to Mayo Clinic via email and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety Fax ). For the ti m e period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment alloc ation/randomization, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety if it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol - specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/randomization through 90 days following cessation of treatment, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, whether or not related to Merck product, must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 24 hours to Merck Global Safety. Events of clinical interest for this trial include: 1. An overdose of Merck product, as defined in Section 10.55, that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results. 2. An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper l imit of normal, as determined by way of protocol- specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* *Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. MC1541 69 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 agent/intervention, should be reported expeditiously. A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 \"General disorders and administration - Other (neonatal loss)\" under the General disorders and administration SOC. 10.55 Reporting of Overdose of Pembrolizumab For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or greater (5 times the indicated dose). No specific informa tion is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. If an adverse event(s) is associated with (\"results from\") the overdose of a Merck product (pembrolizumab) , the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met. If a dose of Merck's product (pembrolizumab) meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non -serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology \"accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.\" All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to Mayo Clinic and within 2 working days hours to Merck G lobal Safety . (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX ). 10.56 Additional Instructions for AE Reporting to Merck A serious ad v erse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of Merck's product that: Results in death; Is life threatening; Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization; Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; Is an other important medical event Note: In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Merck in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by Merck f or collection purposes. Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study); Is associated with an overdose. For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment allocation/randomization, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor (Mayo Clinic) and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety if it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol- specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. For the time period beginning at tr eatment allocation/randomization through 90 days following cessation of treatment, or 30 days following cessation of MC1541 70 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adver se event, including death due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study whether or not related to the Merck product, must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety. Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by an investigator who is a qualified physician to be related to Merck product that is brought to the attention of the investigator at any time following consent through the end of the specified safety follow-up period specified in the paragraph above, or at any time outside of the time period specified in the previous paragraph also must be reported immediately to the Sponsor and to Merck Global Safety. All patients with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome. SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to the Merck Global Safety facsimile number: . A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress Reports is submitted as required by FDA, European Union (EU), Pharmac eutical and Medical Devices agency (PMDA) or other local regulators. Investigators will cross reference this submission according to local regulations to the Merck Investigational Compound Number (IND, CSA, etc.) at the time of submission. Additionally investigators will submit a copy of these reports to Merck & Co., Inc. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; ) at the time of submission to FDA. MC1541 71 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 11.0 Treatment Evaluation Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the Immune- related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) guidelines. 11.1 Schedule of Evaluations: Pre-surgery: Two weeks or less prior to surgery, patients will undergo PETCT imaging to rule out the appearance of new disease that may preclude surgery (see Sections 11.2 and 11.3). The purpose of this repeat PETCT is not to assess response. At surgery: Patients will be classified with respect to a pathologic tumor response. The evaluation for pathologic tumor response will be determined on the basis of surgical outcome (see Section 11.4). Post-surgery: Subsequent to surgery, patients will undergo period ic imaging to determine whether disease has recurred (see 11.5). 11.2 Pre-surgery: Evaluation of PET/ CT after chemoradiotherapy 11.21 If repeat PET /CT does not show evidence of the development of unresectable disease (eg, metastases in a distant site ), the patient will proceed to surgery if he/she remains an operable candidate. 11.22 If the PET/ CT shows lesions that indicate the potential development of unresectable disease, it is strongly encouraged to obtain 3-dimensional imaging within 7 (+/- 3) days that includes IV contrast as part of standard clinical practice, so as to further characterize abdominopelvic or other lesions . Given the unreliability of radiographic changes of the primary tumor during or after chemoRT, due to the inflammatory effects of chemoRT on tissue, assessment of PD will not routinely include changes in the primary tumor or regional nodes, as long as the disease remains resectable. If these images demonstrate unresectable disease in the clinical judgment of the investigator , they will serve as the First Radiologic Evidence of PD (see Table A ). RECIST 1.1 will be applied to this radiographic assessment. However, applying the principles of irRECIST, these radiographic changes in themselves will NOT be considered PD in the absence of tissue confirmation of progression or other definitive evidence of progression . If it is determined tha t surgery is delayed due to this assessment (see Section 1.9d), the patient is encouraged to undergo further therapy with: pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy, if the patient remains a candidate for chemotherapy or pembrolizumab without chemotherapy, if the patient is no longer a candidate for chemotherapy See Section 1.9b for rationale; see Section 1.9d for study outline; see Section 7 for details of therapy . To confirm already suspected PD, repeat imaging should occur no earlier than 4 weeks later; repeat imaging is suggested to occur after 6 to 10 weeks of further anticancer therapy. Repeat imaging will generally consist of PETCT with or without contrast CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, as clinically indicated. If repeat imaging confirms PD, then the patient will be designated as having PD and will be taken off protocol treatment. MC1541 72 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 11.3 Assessment of disease: RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST This study will apply the principles of irRECIST that is adapted to the management of patients with locally advanced GEJ/cardia cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoRT with anticipated surgery. Adapted irRECIST is described below. RECIST 1.1 will be applied to the First Radiologic Evidence of PD (see Section 11.2 ). For subsequent scans following the First Radiologic Evidence of PD, RECIST 1.1 will be adapted to account for the unique tumor response characteristics seen with treatment of pembrolizumab. Immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab may produce antitumor effects by potentiating endogenous cancer-specific immune responses. The changes patterns seen with such an approach may extend beyond the typical time course of responses seen with cytotoxic agents, and can manifest a clinical response after an apparen t initial increase in tumor volume or even the appearance of new lesions. Standard RECIST may not provide an accurate response assessment of immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab. Immune- related RECIST (irRECIST) is RECIST 1.1 adapted as described below to account for the unique tumor response seen with immuno- therapeutics. irRECIST will be used by Investigators to assess progression after initial radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1, and make treatment decisions accordingly. In this study, there will be no confirmation from central review for irRECIST. Therefore, determination of disease status per irRECIST and subsequent decision of treatment continuation/discontinuation is per the treating physician. In general, in the absence of surgical rese ction of the primary and nodes, disease within the RT field ( primary or locoregional nodes ) will be considered unreliable lesions to be used for designation as radiologic PD. The discussion within this section excludes disease within the RT field. If radiologic imaging verifies initial disease progression per RECIST 1.1, treatment may continue at the discretion of the Investigator until repeat imaging 4 weeks later (see Section 7 for systemic therapy regimens). The Investigator's decision to continue treatment while awaiting repeat imaging should be based on the subject's overall clinical condition guided by the following criteria: Absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression No significant decline in ECOG performance status Absence of rapid progression of disease Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention If repeat imaging shows < 20% increase in tumor burden compared to nadir, stable previous new lesion (if identified as cause for initial disease progression), and stable non- target disease (if identified as cause for initial disease progression), treatment may be continued / resumed, and subsequent tumor imaging follows protocol schedule. If lesion s that were identified as cause for initial radiologic disease progression are not deemed to be represent unresectable disease, the patient may proceed to surgery. If repeat imaging confirms disease progression due to any of the scenarios listed below, patients will be discontinued from study therapy. Tumor burden remains 20% and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir Non-target disease resulting in initial disease progression is worse (qualitative) MC1541 73 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 New lesion resulting in initial disease progression is worse (qualitative) Additional new lesion(s) since last evaluation In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased, Investigators should consider all target lesions (with the exception of disease within the RT field ) as well as non -target lesions. When feasible, study treatment should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed. Patients that are deemed clinically unstable are not required to have repeat imaging for confirmation of progressive disease. Guidanc e for treatment continuation/discontinuation and repeat imaging per irRECIST is described in Table A and Table B . Table A. Prior to surgery Clinically stable Clinically unstable Imaging Treatment Imaging Treatment 1st radiologic evidence of PD Repeat imaging at >4 weeksa to confirm PD May continue study treatment at the Investigator's discretion while awaiting confirmatory scan Repeat imaging at >4 weeksa to confirm PD per physician discretion only Discontinue treatment Repeat scan confirms PD No additional imaging required Discontinue treatment (exception is possible upon consultation with PI) No additional imaging required N/A Repeat scan shows non-PD If surgery is not performed, continue further imaging assessments If disease is resectable, proceeding to surgical resection is strongly encouraged. Continuation of study treatment at the Investigator's discretion If surgery is not performed, continue further imaging assessments If disease is resectable and patient is operable, proceeding to surgical resection is strongly encouraged. May restart study treatment if condition has improved and/or clinically stable per Investigator's discretion. PD = progressive disease aRepeat imaging is suggested to occur after 6 to 10 weeks of further anticancer therapy. NOTE: If a subject has confirmed radiographic progression (ie, 2 scans at least 4 weeks apart demonstrating progressive disease) per irRECIST, but the subject is achieving a clinically meaningful benefit, an exception to continue treatment may be considered following consultation with the PI . 11.4 At surgery: Measurement of Pathologic Response Pathologic response will be evaluated after the patient has had surgery and will be based on the pathology review of the submitted surgical specimen according to the following: o Pathologic Complete Response (pCR): On review of the resected esophageal specimen and accompanying lymph nodes no cancer is recognized by the pathologist and margins are free of tumor. o Microscopic Cancer: Gross tumor is not seen by the pathologist but tumor remains in the microscopic analysis or any part of the entire specimen submitted for pathology review. o No Response: Gross cancer i s found on pathologic examination of the resected esophageal cancer and draining lymph nodes. MC1541 74 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 11.5 Completeness of Surgical Resection All operative and pathology reports from patients in the study must be submitted. Reports must contain information about gross and microscopic contamination of surgical resection margins. 11.51 Curative (R0) Resections are defined as \"curative\" (i.e., complete resection; R0 resection) when all gross disease has been removed, and microscopic examination reveals all surgica l margins free of tumor (i.e., pathological stage T1 -3, NX, MO resected). Resections will still be considered curative if pathologic examination reveals positive lymph nodes as long as the nodes were completely res ected. 11.52 Incomplete resection (R1) \"Palliative resection\" (i.e., incomplete resection) will be considered to have taken place when microscopic examination reveals surgical margins which are not free of tumor (R1 resection). Positive margins are defined as tumor at or less than 1 mm from the la teral (\"deep\"), proximal, or distal margins. 11.53 Incomplete resection (R2) \"Palliative resection\" (i.e., incomplete resection) will be considered to have taken place when gross disease has been left behind (R2 resection) . Positive margins are defined as tumor at or less than 1 mm from the lateral (\"deep\"), proximal, or distal margins. 11.54 No resection The primary tumor could not be removed. 11.6 Post-surgery (or after completion of definitive therapy) : Evaluation by CT during adjuvant pembrolizumab or during event monitoring After surgery (or after completion of definitive therapy), CT must be used. If new lesions develop during adjuvant pembrolizumab and up to six months after the last dose of adjuvant pembrolizumab, t he appearance of new lesions must be confirmed by repeat imaging performed 4 or more weeks later following the principles outlined in Section 11.3 (see Table B below). Tissue confirmation should be performed if feasible. If new lesions develop subsequent to the pe riod described above, confirmatory imaging is not required. Table B. Subsequent to surgery Clinically stable Clinically unstable Imaging Treatment Imaging Treatment 1st radiologic evidence of PD Repeat imaging at >4 weeksa to confirm PD May continue study treatment at the Investigator's discretion while awaiting confirmatory scan Repeat imaging at >4 weeks a to confirm PD per physician discretion only Discontinue treatment Repeat scan confirms PD No additional imaging required Discontinue treatment (exception is possible upon consultation with PI) No additional imaging required N/A PD = progressive disease; a Repeat imaging to confirm suspected PD needs to occur only during adjuvant pembrolizumab or if 1st radiologic evidence of PD occurs within 6 months of completing adjuvant pembrolizumab. The timing of this repeat imaging is suggested to occur 6-10 weeks later. D uring this period, pembrolizumab may continue to be administered if the patient is in the adjuvant portion of the study . MC1541 75 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 11.7 Criteria for Discontinuation of Protocol Treatment Progression of disease Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment Unacceptable adverse event(s) Patient decides to withdraw from the study If protocol treatment is discontinued, follow-up and data collection will continue as specified in the protocol. 11.8 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 11.81 Measurement Methods: All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal fractions of centimet ers) using a ruler or calipers. The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. 11.82 Acceptable imaging modalities for measurable disease: FDG PET/CT PET component needs to be FDG- PET. FDG PET/CT imaging is to be used up until the time the patient has had surgery. After su rgery, CT imaging must be used. CT and MRI : this guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. The lesions should be measured on the same pulse sequence. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. Ultrasound (US) is not acceptable to measure tumor lesions that are cl inically not easily accessible. 12.0 Descriptive Factors 12.1 Tumor Location: ga stroesophageal junction vs. gastric cardia. 13.0 Treatment/Follow -up Dec ision at Evaluation of Patient 13.1 Continuation of treatment Patients who are non -PD before surgery will continue treatment per protocol.

Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD-1. 15.12 Formulation Pembrolizumab is available as a liqui d 25 mg/mL, 100 mg/vial. 15.13 Preparation and storage : Vials should be stored in the refrigerator at temperatures between 2 -8\u00b0C. Drug concentrate is further diluted with normal saline (or 5% dextrose in the concentration range of 1 to 10 mg/mL) in IV containers made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or non- PVC material. The infusion solution in the IV bag should be immediately administered. Pembrolizumab solutions may be stored at room temperature for a cumulative period of up to 4 hours. This includes room tempera ture storage of reconstituted solution in vials, room temperature storage of infusion solution in the IV bag and the duration of infusion. In addition,IV bags may be stored at 2 -8 \u00b0C for up to a cumulative time of 20 hours. If refrigerated, the vials and/o r IV bags should be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to subsequent use. 15.14 Administration: Pembrolizumab is administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes via a 0.22 micron in-line filter. The final infusion volume must be between 1 and 10 mg/mL. Maximum rate of infusion should not exceed 6.7 mL/minute through a peripheral or indwelling catheter. Flush the line with 0.9% NaCL following the completion of the infusion. 15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : a) Absorption - Because pembrolizumab is administered intravenously, it is immediately and completely bioavailable. Steady -state concentrations of pembrolizumab are reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing with a Q3W regimen and the systemic accumulation is 2.1 -fold. The peak concentration, trough concentration, and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve at steady state of pembrolizumab increased dose proportionally in the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg Q3W. b) Distribution - Pembrolizumab has a limited volume of distribution. c) Excretion - CL is approximately 23% lower after achieving maximal change at steady state compared with the first dose. T he terminal elimination half -life (t\u00bd) is estimated to be 22 days at steady stat e. d) Metabolism - Pembrolizumab is catabolized through non- specific pathways; metabolism does not contribute to its CL. 15.16 Potential Drug Interactions: There are no known significant drug interactions. 15.17 Known potential adverse events Very common k nown potential toxicities, 10%: MC1541 83 Amendment 9 nausea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, pruritis General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue Common k nown potential toxicities , disorders: constipation, dry mouth Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: severe skin reactions, vitiligo, musculoskeletal pain, and administration site conditions: asthenia, edema, increased, blood increased Uncommon known potential toxicities, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia Psychiatric disorders: known potential toxicities, <1% (Limited to important or life - threatening): Blood and lymphatic system disorders: immune thrombocytopenic syndrome, necrolysis, syndrome, erythema nodosum The risk profile for pembrolizumab also includes two important potential MC1541 84 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 risks: a) myasthenic syndrome, and b) an increased risk of severe complications (such as early severe graft versus host disease and venoocclusive disease) of allogeneic transpl ant in patients with hematologic malignancies who have previously been treated with PD -1 inhibitors. Patients with multiple myeloma who were treated with pembrolizumab in combination with either pomalidomide or lenalidomide and dexamethasone, had an incre ased number of serious side effects and deaths as compared to patients who received only dexamethasone and either pomalidomide or lenalidomide. The benefit -risk profile is unfavorable for the combination of pembrolizumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, and the combination of pembrolizumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in diagnosed treatment -naive multiple myeloma. 15.18 Drug procurement: Pembrolizumab will be provided free of charge to study participants by Merck. 15.19 Nursing Guidelines: 15.191 Pembrolizumab side effects vary greatly from those of traditional chemotherapy and can vary in severity from mild to life threatening.

Pharmacies or clinics shall obtain supplies from normal commercial supply chain or wholesaler. 15.39 Nursing Guidelines: 15.391 Premedicate with steroids, antihistamines, and H2 blockers as per institutional guidelines. 15.392 Mix the infusion bag well. Thorough admixture of this drug often prevents a hypersensitivity reaction. An inline filter of <0.22 micron must be used distal to the infusion pump. Filter may need to be changed if infusion is to be prolonged >12 hours. Inspect solution for excessive particulate matter, if present do not use. 15.393 Caution patients that the alcohol contained in the infusion may cause impairment in operating heavy equipment or in driving a vehicle and to assess their ability before trying either. Advise avoidance of any alcohol or depressants such as sedatives and opiates if not necessary. 15.394 Assess the patient frequently for the first 30 minutes. Taxol\u00ae hypersensitivity reactions, which may include chest pain, back pain, flushing, diaphoresis, dyspnea, pruritus, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm and/or urticaria, usually occur early in the infusion. Have the anaphylaxis tray available. 15.395 If a reaction occurs, stop the infusion immediately. Epinephrine, IV fluids, diphenhydramine, and methylprednisolone may be used as per MD's order. 15.396 Approximately 60% of patients experience peripheral sensory neuropathy (numbness, tingling, burning pain, fine motor skills impairment, paresthesias, dist al sensory loss). Patients receiving higher doses at shorter infusion times are at greater risk. Most cases have been reported at doses >170 mg/m 2/day and with cumulative doses over multiple courses of therapy. The nerve damage may take months to resolve. Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory agents and opiates have not MC1541 91 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 been effective in treating neuropathic pain. Consult MD about trying tricyclic antidepressants or possibly Neurontin. 15.397 Increased risk of cardiotoxicity when given in combination with doxorubicin, with a sharp increase in risk of CHF once cumulative dose of doxorubicin is > 380 mg/m2. At this point taxol should be continued as a single agent only. Monitor for sign/symptoms of CHF. Instruct patient to report any swelling in the hands, arms, feet, or legs, and any chest pain. 15.398 Mucositis can usually be managed with a salt and soda mouthwash (1 tsp. Salt, 1 tsp. Soda and 1 quart boiled water) or try OTC oral Lysine or Vitamin E. 15.399a Narcotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used to manage the myalgias. 15.399b Monitor CBC closely. Neutropenia is most severe in patients who have had previous chemotherapy. Instruct patient to report signs or symptoms of infection, unusual bruising or bleeding to the health care team. 15.399c There is an increased risk of neutropenia and stomatitis when given prior to doxorubicin. Therefore Taxol should always be given after doxorubicin administration. 15.399d Monitor IV site closely and establish patency before administration. Paclitaxel is an irritant, however rarely rash, radiation recall, and ulceration have occurred with infiltration of drug. 15.399e Monitor liver function tests 15.399f Inform patient about total alopecia. 15.399g If given on the same day as a platinum agent, paclitaxel should be administered first to limit myelosuppression and enhance efficacy of agent.

Store intact vials in original outer carton at room temperature and; do not freeze. According to the manufacturer, solutions diluted for infusion are stable up to 6 hours at room temperature or up to 24 hours under refrigeration. Oxaliplatin solution diluted with D 5W to a final concentration of 0.7 mg/mL (polyolefin container) has been shown to retain >90% of it's original concentration for up to 30 days when stored at room temperature or refrigerated; artificial light did not affect the concentration (Andre, 2007). As this study did not examine sterility, refrigeration would be preferred to limit microbial growth. Do not prepare using a chloride -containing solution (e.g., NaCl). Dilution with D 5W (250 or 500 mL) is required prior to administration. Infusion solutions do not require protection from light. 15.414 Administration Refer to the treatment section for specific administration instructions. Administer as I.V. infusion over 2-6 hours. Flush infusion line with D5W prior to administration of any concomitant medication. Patients should receive an antiemetic premedication regimen. Cold temperature may exacerbate acute neuropathy.

Percentages reported with monotherapy. Common k nown potential toxicities , > 10% : Central nervous system: Fatigue, fever, pain, headache, insomnia Gastrointestinal: Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, anorexia, stomatitis Hematologic: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia Hepatic: Neuromuscular & skeletal: Back pain, peripheral neuropathy (may be dose lim iting). The most commonly observed oxaliplatin toxicity is acute and cumulative neurotoxicity, observed in patients treated at doses above 100 mg/m2/cycle. This neurotoxicity has included paresthesias and dysesthesias of the hands, feet, and perioral regi on as well as unusual laryngopharyngeal dysesthesias characterized by a loss of sensation of breathing without any objective evidence of respiratory distress (hypoxia, laryngospasm, or bronchospasm). OXAL neurotoxicity appears to be exacerbated by exposure to cold. Patients on this study will be counseled to avoid cold drinks and exposure to cold water or air. Should a patient develop laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia, their oxygen saturation should be evaluated via a pulse oximeter; if normal, an anxiolytic agent should be given and the patient observed in the clinic until the episode has resolved. Because this syndrome may be associated with the rapidity of OXAL infusion, subsequent doses of OXAL should be administered as a 6 -hour infusion (instead of the normal 2-hour infusion). Acute and cumulative neurotoxicities are dose limiting for OXAL. The acute neurotoxicity is characterized by paresthesias and dysesthesias that may be triggered or exacerbated by exposure to cold. These symptoms occur within hours of exposure and are usually reversible over the following hours or days. Cumulative doses of OXAL above 680 mg/m 2 may produce functional impairment characterized by difficulty performing activities requiring fine sensory -motor coordination; impairment is caused by sensory rather than motor changes. The likelihood of experiencing neurotoxicity is directly related to the total cumulative dose of OXAL administered. The relative risk of developing neurotoxicity was 10%, 50%, and 75% in patients who received total cumulative OXAL doses of 780 mg/m 2, 1,170 mg/m2, and 1,560 mg/m2, respectively. Both acute and cumulative neurotoxicities due to OXAL have lessened in 82% of patients within 4 to 6 months, and have completely disappeared by 6 to 8 months in 41% of patients. In addition, the likelihood that neurologic symptoms will regress has been shown to correlate inversely with cumulative dose.

MC1541 98 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology 16.1 Study Overview / Rationale This single -arm Phase 1b/2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and anti -tumor effect of patients with resectable, locally advanced, GEJ/gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, who are treated with pembrolizumab plus weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel, and concurrent daily radiotherapy for approximately 5 weeks, followed by surgery and post-operative pembrolizumab. Fifteen patients will be enrolled for phase 1b portion of the study to conduct a thorough review of adverse event data of pre-operative pembrolizumab. The phase II portion of the study implements a single- arm de sign based on the primary endpoint of pathological complete response (pathCR) rate . Other endpoints include toxicity profile of pre-operative and post-operative treatment and surgical complications, progression- free survival (PFS) , disease free survival (D FS), R0 rate, time-to-relapse (TTR) , and overall survival (OS) . 16.2 Sample size and accrual time: A maximum of 34 patients (17-phase I, 17- phase II) will be enrolled to yield a total of 30 evaluable patients (15 -phase I, 15-phase II), assuming 10% of pat ients who are deemed ineligible after registration, withdraw consent before any treatment or are lost -to-follow up prior to resection. If more than the targeted evaluable patients are accrued, the additional patients will not be used in any decision making process; however, they will be included in final estimations of rates and associated confidence interval of primary and secondary endpoints. We estimate that we will need to accrue an additional 11 patients during the pre- registration phase to end up with 34 patients for the registration phase of the trial (17-phase I, 17-phase II). So in summary, we anticipate pre-registering 45 patients to register a total of 34 patients necessary for the study design and allotted over accrual. 16.3 Statistical design fo r phase 1b portion 16.31 Definition of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) We anticipate neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel/radiotherapy will be well - tolerated when combined with pembrolizumab. However, theoretically, toxicities may arise from an interaction between radiotherapy and pembrolizumab, so as a precaution, safety will be assessed in the phase 1b portion of the study. When the first 15 patients who become evaluable for phase 1b dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), accrual will be halted. A patient is eva luable for phase 1b safety assessment if the patient initiates pre-operative treatment per protocol. We anticipate accruing 17 eligible patients to yield 15 evaluable patients, based on 93% rate of undergoing surgery reported for the chemoRT arm in the CRO SS trial. The DLTs during the phase 1b portion are defined as the following: 1. Type 1 DLT: Grade 4 (life-threatening) non -hematologic adverse event (AE) during pre- operative chemoradiotherapy that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to pembrolizumab- based chemo(radio)therapy ; OR A delay in the initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant radiation by >14 days that is at least possibly due to pembrolizumab toxicity during the neoadjuvant portion of the study; OR A delay in surgery such that surgery occurs >12 weeks after the last dose of RT due to toxicities that are at least possibly related to pembrolizumab will MC1541 99 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 be considered a DLT during the neoadjuvant portion of the study ; OR Any Grade 5 adverse event during neoadjuvant therapy. NOTE: Patients will be followed for up to 90 days after last dose of neoadjuvant therapy or until surgery, whichever occurs first. 2. Type 2 DLT: Grade 5 event within 30 days after surgery ; OR Grade 4 non-hematologic AE within 30 days after surgery at least possibly related to pembrolizumab, excluding AEs that resolve to Grade 2 or less within 7 days. 3. Type 3 DLT: Grade 4 non-hematologic adverse event during adjuvant pembrolizumab that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to pembrolizumab; OR Any Grade 5 adverse event during adjuvant pembrolizumab NOTE: Pa tients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab after surgery will be considered evaluable for a Type 3 DLT. NOTE: Patients will be followed for a Type 3 DLT for up to 90 days after last dose of adjuvant pembrolizumab. 16.32 Decision rules for continuation of accrual for phase 2 portion With 15 evaluable patients, the analyses of DLTs will be conducted. Consideration will be made to proceed to the Phase 2 portion if all of the following criteria are met (see above for definition of DLT): 1. 4 patients (out of 15 evaluable patients) have a Type 1 DLT 2. 2 patients (out of 15 evaluable patients) have a Grade 5 Type 2 DLT 3. 6 patients (out of 15 evaluable patients) have a Grade 4 non-hematologic Type 2 DLT 4. 3 patients (out of 15 evaluable patients) have a Grade 4 non-hematologic Type 3 DLT 5. 1 patients (out of 15 evaluable patients) have a Grade 5 Type 3 DLT In addition, dose delays and interruptions of chemotherapy and radiation that are at least possibly related to toxicity of the treatment regimen will be considered in the evaluation of safety. After this evaluation, we will consider re suming accrual, for the phase 2 portion. Patients enrolled for the phase 1b portion who are evaluable for phase 2 primary endpoint evaluation will be included in the phase 2 efficacy decision- making processes, and final endpoint rates estimations. If the results from safety analysis indicate that safety parameters were not met, data will be analyzed to determine the specific nature and etiologies of safety concerns. After consideration by the study team (study chair[s], statistician, etc.) and the primary IRB, a decision will be made as to whether accrual can be resumed, or modifications to the protocol should be adapted. We acknowledge that the final decision to move to the Phase 2 portion of the study will rest in the clinical judgment of the investigative team and that mitigating factors such as a patient's decision not to undergo surgery, or the occurrence of severe unexpected complications during neoadjuvant therapy may potentially factor into the decision -making process. If more than 2 patients experience a Grade 5 event that is at least possi bly related to study treatment, the study will not proceed to Phase 2. 16.33 Phase 1b portion study operating characteristics: MC1541 100 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Assuming that the occurrence of two types of DLTs are independently distributed with binomial distribution, the probabilities of failing to meet the phase 1b decision rules can be tabulated according to various true rate of the DLTs. See table below: True rate of type 1 DLT True rate of type 2 DLT Probability of failing to meet the phase 1b safety criteria 0.1 0.05 0.0485 0.2 0.05 0.1945 0.3 0.05 0.5032 0.1 0.1 0.1944 0.2 0.1 0.3181 0.3 0.1 0.5794 0.1 0.2 0.6070 0.2 0.2 0.6673 0.3 0.2 0.7948 0.1 0.3 0.8748 0.2 0.3 0.8940 0.3 0.3 0.9346 16.4 Statistical design for phase 2 portion 16.41 Overview A single -arm design will be implemented for the phase 2 portion. Phase 2 portion patients will receive the same neoadjuvant regimen and surgery as in the Phase 1b portion (pembrolizumab plus weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel, and concurrent daily radiotherapy for approximately 5 weeks, followed by surgery and post-operative pembrolizumab). The CROSS trial was the largest trial, to date, examining neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel/RT therapy in esophageal/GEJ adenocarcinoma patients2. This trial established this regimen as a new standard of care in this indication. In CROSS, of 180 patients assigned to chemoRT/surgery, 161 patients underwent resection, and 148 patients had an R0 resection. Primary analysis included only those patients who were assigned to the chemoRT arm and who did not withdraw consent. A total of 178 patients were included primary analysis (2 patients of the 180 patients total withdrew consent prior to initiating chemoRT), among which 134 patients had adenocarcinoma histology. Among the 134 adenocarcinoma patients assigned to the chemoRT/surgery arm i ncluded in primary analysis, 21% (28/134) had a pathCR. (It is important to distinguish histologic subtypes, since the pathCR rate among SCC patients was significantly higher [~49%].) The number of adenocarcinoma patients who initiated chemoRT, underwent s urgery, or underwent resection, was not reported. As a second reference, in Burmeister et al (see below), 80 eligible patients with esophageal/GEJ adenocarcinoma were assigned to cisplatin/5FU -based chemoRT (35 Gy), of whom 6 patients had a pathCR, yielding a pathCR rate of 7.5% (6/80) with the denominator being all eligible patients assigned to chemoRT regardless of whether treatment was initiated. Based on these data from CROSS, we conservatively selected a pathCR rate of 21% as our historical control, wi th the denominator being eligible patients who MC1541 101 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 do not withdraw consent, as it is the most reliable available estimate of the reference pathCR rate in this patient population. The addition of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab is expected to improve the pathCR rate by 27% or more in this population, to yield a pathCR rate of 48% or more. 16.42 Primary endpoint Pathological complete responses (pathCR): is defined as number of patients with pathologic complete responses (see definition in section 11.6) divided by total evaluable patients. All phase II patients meeting the eligibility criteria that have signed a consent form and have begun protocol trea tment will be considered evaluable for pathCR . 16.43 Study design and decision rules The phase 2 portion is powered to detect an improvement in the pathCR rate of 27% (i.e. achieving pathCR rate of at least 48% for the alternative hypothesis) compared to historical control of 21% , which is the null hypothesis . A total of 15 evaluable patients provide s a power of 81% to claim the proposed regimen warrants further study at one-sided significance level of 0. 08, if a t least 6 patients achieve pathCR (40% obser ved pathCR rate). We acknowledge the limitations of pathCR in reflecting the anti -tumor efficacy of pembrolizumab. If fewer than 6 patients achieve pathCR, the decision for further study will be discussed by the study team, after analysis of safety and tox icity data, PFS and other endpoints. 16.44 Power and significance level Assuming the number of patients with pathCR is binomially distributed, the operating characteristics of current design can be tabulated according to various true rates of pathCR (see table b elow ). True pathCR rate Probability of declaring that the proposed regimen warrants further study is... 0.21 0.08 0.30 0.28 responses (pathCR) The pathCR rate will be estimated by the number of patients who achieve pathCR divided by the total evaluable number of patients. Ninety percent two-sided confidence interval will be calculated according to the exact binomial method. 16.5 Analyses plan for secondary endpoints: 16.51 Progression- free survival (PF S) Progression- free survival is defined as the time from the date of study registration to the date of death due to all causes , recurrences if R0 resections are achieved, progression disease before undergoing surgery, or R1/R2 resection at surgery, whichever occurs first, among evaluable patients. The distribution of PF S will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier. Two-year PFS rate and confidence interval will be estimated based on Kaplan -Meier curve. MC1541 102 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 16.52 Overall survival (OS) Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of study registration to the date of death due to all causes, among evaluable patients. The distribution of OS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan- Meier. Two-year OS rate and confidence interval will be estimated based on Kaplan -Meier curve. 16.53 Disease free survival (DFS) DFS is defined as the time from the date of study registration to the date of death due to all causes or recurrence, whichever occurs first, am ong patients who achieved an R0 resection . The distr ibution of DFS the method of Kaplan- Meier. Two-year DFS rate and confidence interval will be estimated based on Kaplan -Meier curve. 16.54 Time -to-relapse ( TTR ) TTR is defined as the time from the date of study registration to the date of 1st documented relapse/recurrence among patients who achieve R0 resection. The distribution of TTR will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier. Two- year relapse- free rate and confidence interval will be estimated based on Kaplan - Meier curve. 16.55 R0 rate R0 rate is defined as the number of patients who achieve R0 resection divided by total number of evaluable patients. 16.56 Adverse events The maximum grade for each type of adverse events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to study treatments will be recorded for each patient. The frequency tables will be reviewed to determine the patterns. 16.6 Data & Safety Monitoring 16.61 Revi ew The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems that might be developing. The trial is monitored continually by the study team who are not ified of every Grade 4 and 5 event in real time. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by the MCCC Stati stical Office. 16.62 Adverse Event Stopping Rules The stopping rules specified below are based on the knowledge available at study development. We note that the Adverse Event Stopping Rule may be adjusted in the event of either (1) the study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and in consideration of newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the intervention(s) under investigation. The study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below. CTCAE v4.0 will be used to determine grading for these stopping rules. Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe adverse events th at satisfy any of the following during the Phase II portion of the trial: MC1541 103 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 If at any time 33% or more of patients, including the patients from the phase 1b, experience a Grade 4 or 5 non- hematologic adverse event (AE) during neoadjuvant therapy that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to pembrolizumab -based chemo(radio)therapy. (Type 1 DLT, where patients will be followed for a Type 1 DLT (ie, during neoadjuvant therapy) for up to 90 days after last dose of neoadjuvant therapy or until surgery, whichever occurs first ) If at any time 14% or more of patients, including the patients from the phase 1b, experience a Grade 5 event within 30 days after surgery that is possibly, probably, or definitely related pembrolizumab- based chemo(radio)therapy. (Type 2 DLT) If at any ti me 54% or more of patients, including the patients from the phase 1b, experience a grade 4 non -hematologic AE within 30 days after surgery at least possibly related to pembrolizumab, excluding AEs that resolve to grade 2 or less within 7 days. (Type 2 DLT ) If at any time 25% or more of patients, including the patients from the phase 1b, experience a Grade 4 non- hematologic adverse event during adjuvant pembrolizumab that is possibly, probably, or definitely related pembrolizumab. (Grade 4 non -hematologic T ype 3 DLT) If at any time 10% or more of patients, including the patients from the phase 1b, experience a Grade 5 adverse event during adjuvant pembrolizumab that is possibly, probably, or definitely related pembrolizumab. (Grade 5 Type 3 DLT) We note that we will review all Grade 5 adverse events on a case-by- case basis as well (regardless of attribution), and may suspend accrual after just one Grade 5 event, if we feel it is necessary for patient safety. 16.7 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 16.71 Study availability This study will be available to all eligible patients, regardless of race, gender, or ethnic origin. 16.72 Statistical analysis by subset There is no information currently available regarding differential effects of study regimens in subsets d efined by race, gender, or ethnicity, and there is no reason to expect such differences to exist. Therefore, although the planned analysis will, as always, look for differences in treatment effect based on racial and gender groupings, the sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power for subset analyses. MC1541 104 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 16.73 Regional population Based on prior studies involving similar disease sites, we expect about 10% patients will be classified as minorities by race and about 12% of patients to be women. Expected size of racial by gender subsets are shown in the following table: Ethnic Category Sex/Gender Females Males Unknown Total Hispanic or Latino 0 3 0 3 Not Hispanic or Latino 4 27 0 31 Ethnic Category: Total of all subjects 4 30 0 34 Racial Category American Indian or Alaskan Native 0 2 0 2 Asian 0 0 0 0 Black or African American 0 1 0 1 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander 0 0 0 0 White 4 27 0 31 Racial Category: Total of all subjects 4 30 0 34 Ethnic Categories: Hispanic or Latino - a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rico, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.

From http://www.ecog.org/general/perf stat.html MC1541 120 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Appendix I I Surgical Guidelines for Esophagectomy Procedure Type : Esophageal malignancies located in the upper esophagus (above azygous vein) will be removed by either an \"Extended Ivor Lewis\" approach utilizing a combined abdominal, right chest, and neck incision; or transhiatal resection. For lower mid- esophageal and gastroesophageal malignancies, either an \"Ivor -Lewis\" procedure (abdominal incision and right thoracotomy) or transhiatal resection should be performed. Gastroesophageal tumors also may be removed via a left thoracoabdominal incision. Lesions located with the cervical esophagus thus requiring concurrent laryngectomy should not be included. Minimally invasive resections involving either a laparoscopic or combined laparoscopic/ thoracoscopic resection are permissible provided lymph node dissection guidelines are followed. Robotic dissections in either the chest, or abdomen, or both are also permissible under the same criteria. Any questions regarding eligibility of surgical technique can be referred to the surgical PI for review. It is strongly recommended that the mediastinal pleura overlying the esophageal cancer and the periesophageal fat 5 -cm proximal and distal to the primary lesion be removed en bloc with the tumor during the esophagectomy. Ligation of the thoracic duct is encouraged if this structure is seen at the time of surgery or that if injury to the duct may have occurred to prevent postoperative chylothorax. Also any indeterminate lesions with in the lung should be removed to determine if metastatic disease is present. Surgical Margins: Lateral surgical margins between the primary tumor and mediastinal structures should be marked by both the surgeon (metal clips) and pathologist (inked). Microscopic or deep margins <1mm will be considered positive for malignancy and will be dually noted. All margins should be at least 5 cm beyond gross tumor if possible after removal of the esophagus. It is recommended that the length of the margin be measured with the specimen stretched out by the pathologist before surgical closure. Frozen sections should be obtained to ensure negative surgical margins for cancer as well as Barrett's esophagus. Lymph Node Dissections: All patients should undergo complete mediastinal lymph node and perigastric (lesser curvature and left gastric artery) dissection regardless of whether the nodes appeared positive or negative during clinical staging. If a patient had positive lymph nodes on clinical staging, the stations that had been positive should be removed at the time of surgery to confirm nodal status. At the time of esophagectomy, lymph node stations should be should be individually sampled and sent as separate specimens to the pat hologist. However, lymph nodes densely adherent to the tumor should not be removed separately, but sent en bloc with the specimen. All lymph nodes that are technically accessible should be removed. After careful labeling, the status of these nodes should be conveyed to the central review site. Simple sampling of representative nodes should be discouraged. Lymph nodes from levels 2R, 3p, 4R, 7,8,9,15,16,17,18,19,20 should be submitted for review if feasible. All submitted nodes should be resected and labele d for each individual station. Lesser curve nodes and celiac axis nodes should be marked by the surgeon and evaluated for levels 15,16,17,20. If one of the levels sited above is not sampled, an explanation should be submitted to the Central Office. Exceptions: Exceptions to any of the above are acceptable if documentation of rationale is provided. If the patient is found to have evidence of metastatic disease intraoperatively, a palliative resection may be pursued. MC1541 121 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Known potential adverse events from esophageal/gastric surgery or postoperative period (usually up to 60 days, but can be longer) Common potential toxicities, >10% : Central nervous system: Pain .

Example of Gross Description: 1. A segment o f (distal, proximal, mid) esophagus, __ cm in length and __ cm in circumference, with portion of proximal stomach, __ cm in length. 2. An ulcerated/fungating tan friable/firm tumor, __x__x__ cm, has its epicenter in the distal esophagus, __ cm proximal to the EGJ/in the esophagogastric junction and focally extends to the adventitial margin. The tumor is __ cm from the proximal and __ cm from the distal resection margins. OR 2. A shallow ulcer/smooth depressed area, __x_x_ cm, overlying fibrotic wall is p resent , has its epicenter in the distal esophagus, __ cm proximal to the EGJ/in the esophagogastric and focally extends to the adventitial margin. The ulcer is __ cm from the proximal and __ cm from the distal resection margins. (Note: Post treatment resection specimens may have little grossly evident tumor. The location of the tumor should be verified by referring to previous path reports and/or clinic notes. The entire abnormal area must be submitted.) 3. The uninvolved esophagus is unremarkabl e/dull, granular/a segment cm in length is evident proximal/distal/surrounding the tumor. (Describe any nodular area within the Barrett's mucosa.) The stomach is unremarkable, (OR comment on any gross abnormalities) Sampling for esophagogastrectomy specimen Typically, esophageal carcinomas show extensive ulceration after pre-operative chemoradiation. 1. If residual tumors are grossly identifiable, tumor and ulcerated area (this includes the whole circumference of esophagus if ulceration is focal or patchy) should be sampled for histological evaluation at 2 -3 mm intervals. Each section should include whole thickness of esophageal wall including inked adventitia for evaluation of radial margin. At least 1 cm of normal appearing esophagus or stomach should be sampled proximal and distal to tumor and ulcerated area. 2. If no residual tumors are grossly identified, areas with ulceration (this includes the whole circumference of esophagus if ulceration is focal or patchy) indicating of treatment field should be completely sample at 2 -3 mm intervals and submitted for histological examinations. Each section should include whole thickness of esophageal wall including inked adventitia for evaluation of radial margin. At least 1 cm of normal appearing esophagus or stomach should be sampled proximal and distal to tumor and ulcerated area. 3. If no ulceration indicating of treatment field is identified. The entire esophagus including gastroesophageal junction should be completely sampled at 2- 3 mm intervals and submitted for MC1541 124 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 histological examinations. Each section should include whole thickness of esophageal wall including inked adventitia for evaluation of radial margin. 4. Proximal esophageal resection margin and distal gastric resection margin sho uld be completely submitted for histological evaluation. 5. All grossly identifiable lymph nodes should be completely submitted for histological evaluation. If less than 10 lymph nodes are identified, the whole periesophageal and perigastric soft tissue shou ld be completely submitted for histological evaluation for the presence of lymph nodes. 6. Representative sections of normal esophagus and normal stomach sections should also be sampled. Sections: proximal margin en face (frequently submitted for frozen section) - open the specimen first before submitting blocks for frozen section distal margin en face (frequently submitted for frozen section) - open the specimen first before submitting blocks for frozen section tumor with deepest extent and adventitial margin tumor with adjacent non-neoplastic tissue Barrett's, if any When tumor is not grossly evident as in post -chemoradiated esophagus, the entire abnormal segment must be submitted. Lymph nodes should be clearly label ed as paraesophageal and paragastric lymph nodes indicating location (greater or lesser curvature, etc.) Representative GE junction, normal esophagus and normal stomach Histological examination for esophagogastrectomy specimen Immunohistochemical stain for Cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) should be performed if microscopic foci of suspicious residual tumor are identified on routine H&E sections (tumor, lymph node, or margin sections) to accurately stage the tumor. This stain will not be performed routinely if no hi stological evidence of residual tumor is seen on H&E sections. MC1541 125 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Pembrolizumab ECI Drug -Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Hepatotoxicity is injury or damage to the liver that may be associated with impaired liver function (Navarro and Senior 2006). Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is one of the most common causes of termination of drug development, a major reason for refusal of market authorization and for restricted use, and the single most important cause of the withdrawal of market authorization for products (Bj\u00f6rnsson 2006). Thus, drug -induced hepatotoxicity is a major concern during the discovery, development to postauthorization phases of the product life cycle (excerpted from Draft Guidance Document, Hepatotoxicity of Health Products, Ministry of Public Health, Canada, December 2010). As stated in the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry - Drug - Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation; hepatocellular injury (usually detected by serum aminotransferase elevations [AT]) can be caused by drugs that rarely, if ever, cause severe DILI (e.g. aspirin, tacrine, statins, and heparin) as well as by drugs that do cause such injury. The frequency of serum AT elevations also is not a good indicator of a potenti al for severe DILI, because drugs such as tacrine (not a cause of severe DILI) can cause AT elevations in as many as 50 percent of patients. Very high levels of observed ATs may be a somewhat better indicator of potential for severe DILI, but the most specific indicator is evidence of altered liver function accompanying or promptly following evidence of hepatocellular injury. The single clearest (most specific) predictor found to date of a drug's potential for severe hepatotoxicity, is the occurrence of hepatocellular injury (AT elevation) accompanied by increased serum total bilirubin (TBL), not explained by any other cause, such as viral hepatitis or exposure to other hepatotoxins, and without evidence of cholestasis, together with an increased incidence of AT elevations in the overall trial population compared to control. Increased plasma prothrombin time, or its international normalized ratio (INR), a consequence of reduced hepatic production of Vitamin K dependent clotting factors, is another potentially useful measure of liver function that might suggest the potential for severe liver injury. Recognition of the importance of altered liver function, in addition to liver injury, began with Hyman Zimmerman's observation that drug-induced hepatocellular injury (i.e. AT elevation) accompanied by jaundice (i.e. TBL elevation) had a poor prognosis, with a 10 to 50 percent mortality from acute liver failure (in pretransplantation days) (Zimmerman 1978, 1999). This became known as \"Hy's Law\". This document describes the recommended process for monitoring and evaluation of subjects meeting the laboratory criteria for potential DILI defined as: an elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) lab value that is greater than or equal to three times (3X) the upper limit of normal (ULN) and an elevated total bilirubin ( TBL ) lab value that is greater than or equal to two times (2X) ULN and at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) lab value that is less than 2X ULN, as a result of within -protocol-specific testing or unscheduled testing. The protocol identifies these laboratory criteria for potential DILI as ECIs. ECIs are selected adverse experiences that must be reported within 24 hours. Initiate close observation as defined below and continue follow- up until resolution. Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two (2) or three (3) times weekly. Frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or study drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic. Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. MC1541 126 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Obtain a history of concomitant medication use (including prescription and nonprescription medications, herbal and other dietary supplements ), alcohol use, recreational drug use and special diets. (See Section 5 for details.) Obtain a history of exposure to chemical agents or other environmental toxins. Obtain additional history and complete Stage 1 workup to attempt to rule out other potentia l causes of the transaminase elevation, including but not limited to the following: acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; MC1541 127 Amendment 9 Protocol version: 20Dec2019 Appendix VI Presentation of Dermatologic Event Collect information on clinical present ation and potential contributing factors.
