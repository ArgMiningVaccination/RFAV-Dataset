In discussing the scope of CCE collaborators/MCCN network of Providers (co llaborators), indicate how the number of collaborators is suffici ent and how the collabo rators match the utilization patterns of the population you propose to serve. The core collaborators requested via a Letter of Int ent to DHFS Medicaid claims data for residents of Macon County. A summary of claims data is reflec ted below, indicating over $80 million dollars in Medicaid expense. A total of 14,001 individuals were provided Medicaid-covered services in 2010. Table 1 All Medicaid Service Reci pients in Macon County by Age Group Age Groups Total 19-20 21 - 44 45 - 64 65+ # of Recipients: 14,011 5 Data was also requested from DFHS for two target populations: individuals with serious mental illness and seniors with chronic illnesses. Following is an analysis of key points discovered through analysis of claims data for each target population: Data Analysis for Serious Mental Illness in Macon County Analysis of the data provided by the Departme nt of Healthcare and Family Services, Macon County residents with serious mental illness tota l 1547 individuals. Total cost of care for these individuals under the Medicaid program was $18,573, 657 in 2010. The cost of care for these individuals was 23% of total cost of care for all Medicaid recipients in Macon County however the number of individuals with serious mental illness was only 11% of total Medicaid recipients receiving care. Table 1 - SMI Target Population: Seriously Mentally Ill Adults (18+), Medicaid Service Recipients by Age Group Age Group > 18 +, SMI Total 19-20 21-44 45-64 65+ # of 28% 12% Behavioral health conditions, such as substance abuse or mental health issues, often trigger the onset of chronic ailments such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. According to the Service Administration of Mental Health and Substance Abuse (SAMHSA), sixty-eight percent of individuals with a mental health disorder have one or more me dical conditions. Of the nearly sixty percent of adults with a medical condition, about one-third hav e a co-occurring mental disorder. Those with co- occurring mental health disorders experience much poorer health outcomes. Macon County claims data indicates that SMI individuals were found to have co-morbid conditions at a high rate. Of the total of 1547 individuals with SMI, 829 individuals have one of four most prevalent co-morbid conditions, including: 236 suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); 192, from hyperten sion; 261, from diabetes and 10 2, from congestive heart failure (CHF). A significant number of SMI individuals suffer from two or more of these conditions, including 6 87 with COPD and hypertension; 22 with COPD and CHF, 33 with COPD and diabetes; 74 with diabetes and hypertension; 29 with diabetes and CHF. Additionally, a number of SMI individuals suffer from three illnesses, including: 22 with COPD, diabetes and CHF; and, 36 with diabetes COPD and hypertension. Coordination of care for these individuals with co-morbid conditions will be a priority focus of the care coordination effort.

Hospit alizations are approximately 50% longer than the length of stay for those wit hout serious mental illness. Table 3 - Emergency Department (E.D.) Visits for SMI Individuals vs. Individuals without SMI Individuals with SMI Individuals with no SMI E. D. Visits Per 1000 2,914 1256 Total E. D. visits 4,797 16,369 Emergency Department visits for individuals with serious mental illness occur approximately two and one -half times more frequently than for those without serious mental illness. The following tables provide a focus on high ri sk and high service use seriously mentally ill individuals in Macon County. The data in these tables reflect those individuals with one or more chronic health conditions and at least one hospital st ay. Seriously mentally ill (SMI) adults in Macon County (1547 individuals) constitute 11% of the total number of individuals receiving Medicaid supported medical services (14,011 individuals). Total cost for treatment of SMI individuals ($18,573,657), however, amounts to over 24% of to tal Medicaid spending ($81,355,014) for all Macon County Medicaid recipients receiving services. Cost per individual with SMI is $12,006 per year, over two and one-half times as high as the cost for those individuals without serious mental illness ($4,715)). Hospital inpatient days for SMI individuals total 3974 or 37% of all inpatient days. ED visits for SMI individuals total 1921 and comprise 23% of total ER visits. SMI individuals are using inpatient and ED services at a rate over two times as freque ntly as those Macon County residents without SMI. Table 4 - SMI Target Population: Subset A: Medicaid Service Recipients with One or More Chronic Health Conditions and at least one hospital stay >18 +SMI + 1 or more chronic health co nditions + at least one hospital stay # of Recipients: 403 12 165 174 52 100% 9 Subset A: Medicaid Service Recipients with One or More Chronic Health Conditions and at least one hospital stay, by Gender Gender Female 238 5 99 95 52 100% A: 100% 4% 40% 48% 8% narrow focus on those indivi duals who are most at risk for significant health problems. These individuals have a serious mental illnes s and at least one other serious chronic health condition and had at least one hospitalization in 201 0. They comprise the highest of the high risk individuals in the County with SMI. They also repr esent the starting point for involvement in care coordination. In an effort to improve health outcomes for these individuals and to reduce Medicaid program expense, a narrow focus on the most health- challenged individual provides the best opportunity for health improvement and cost containment.

Average Medicaid cost for this set of individuals is $34,865 per year. Of the 1547 SMI individuals in Macon County, 865 received mental he alth Medicaid services. The average annual cost per recipient for those receiving mental health Me dicaid services is $9,606. A total of 682 SMI individuals are not receiving mental health Medicaid services. This group has an average annual cost per recipient of $14,830, approximately. These data points strongly suggest that engaging thos e individuals in the top quartile of Medicaid service expense and those individuals not currently receiving mental heal th Medicaid services in care coordination is central to Medicaid cost contai nment and improved health outcomes for these groups. A focus on these two groups of individuals and t heir inpatient and Emergency Department utilization will be the primary aim of the ca re coordination effort. Macon Co unty Care Coordination estimates that savings in Medicaid spendi ng can be achieved through care coordination efforts focused on the two above described groups of seriously mentally ill individuals. This savings is anticipated to be beyond cost-neutrality of Medicaid service deliver y and care coordination expense. As discussed elsewhere in this proposal, any shared savings t hat may accrue to Macon County Care Coordination would be re-invested in services for this target population through purchase of service contracting from the Lead Entity, the Macon County Mental Health Board, to service prov iders in the community. Service needs and services to be purchased through this shared savings amount would be 11 determined based on core collaborator recommendations for closing service gaps in the local service system. The core collaborators for Macon County Care Co ordination provide the treatment settings that will be necessary for involvement in care coordination efforts aimed at engaging both SMI individuals currently receiving behavioral health treatment an d those not currently in treatment. The core collaborators' involvement is essent ial to the coordination of care for those SMI individuals with co- morbid conditions. The community hospitals (Decatur Memorial Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital), provide the only inpatient and Emergency Department services in the community. The FQHC (Community Health Improvement Center) serves as the outpatient primary care provider for the community's Medicaid and indigent populations. The certified mental health and substance abuse service provider (Heritage Behaviora l Health Center) is the key provider for Medicaid mental health and substance abuse treatment. Data Analysis for Seniors with Chronic Illness in Macon County Seniors with chronic health conditions constitute 11.8% (1,758 individuals) of the total number of individuals receiving medical services paid by Medi caid (14,681 individuals). The senior population of Macon County includes 18,166 individuals age 65 or older, 16.4% of the total Macon County population. Macon County's elderly population is pr oportionately larger that the state average of 12.5%. Total Medicaid spending for Macon County Seniors in 2010 was $21,341 ,062, with a cost per recipient of $12,357. Of that total spending, $14,341,062 or 67% was spent for nursing facility services. Home and community-based service (per sonal care, homemaker and other) services totaled an additional $3,718,958. Twenty seven perc ent of seniors used a total of 965 Emergency Department visits. Twenty one percent of seniors we re hospitalized, involving 472 hospitalizations and 2,014 inpatient days of care. Ninety seven percent of seniors re ceiving Medicaid services were dually-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. It is understood that, for purposes of th e Innovations Solicitation, anticipated savings in Medicare spending will not be considered in calculat ing savings achieved by ca re coordination efforts. Macon County Care Coordination has identified gaps in the service delivery system for seniors, at hospitalization, post hospitalization and subseque nt nursing home placement. While savings may not be significant in focusing on Seniors who are ho spitalized and considered for nursing home admission, Macon County Care Coordination belie ves that the savings achieved through care coordination for seriously mentally ill individuals will support an effort to focus on a small set of Seniors who have been hospitalized and who may be diverted from nursing home placement through a coordinated application of co mmunity-based and in-home services. It was the consensus of the core collaborators for this proposal that coordi nation of care for seniors is a systems development 12 need for this community and an effort that will pr epare the community for anticipated system changes in the future. 3.2.1.5 Describe the governance st ructure of the CCE or MCCN, such as policies and mechanisms in place to share information and ensure compliance with the care coordination model described in your Proposal. Please attach the relevant articl es of incorporation or by-laws that outline the governance structure as Attachment G. Macon County Care Coordination is organized as a program of the Macon County Mental Health Board, partnering with key medical and behaviora l health service providers in Macon County. The Core Collaborators elected to establish a program design with the lead entity, supported by a care coordination agreement signed by all core collaborators. In addition, the core collaborators, as network service provider s, have agreed via Business Associate Agreements, to exchange electronic health information for the purpose of care coordi nation. In addition, the core collaborators have entered into Memorandum of Understanding agreements with Macon County Care Coordination to serve as providers of service for the Solicitati on proposal's target populations. All network service providers will be asked to enter into a Memor andum of Understanding with Macon County Care Coordination for collaboration in service provision and in care coordination for enrolled individuals. These agreements are outlined as follows, to establ ish the care coordination program and to provide for the operation of the program and permit health information exchange. (Please see executed agreements in Attachment G): A. Agreement for Care Coordination in Macon County Core Collaborators have established an agreement establishing Macon County Care Coordination as a program of the Lead Entity, formed for the purpose of care coordination between and among the six core collaborators for enro llees in care coordination.

This provision has been included so that negotiation s and discussions with potential providers for the network can occur. B. Memorandum of Understanding between the Ca re Coordination Entity, Macon County Care Coordination, and each service provider that is pa rt of the initial Macon County Care Coordination network. This Memorandum of Understanding outlines the re sponsibilities of the Ne twork Service Provider to Care Coordination Enrollees and to Macon County Care Coordination, as well as Macon County Care Coordination's respon sibilities to Network Service Pr oviders and Enrollees. Several 13 Memorandum of Agreement documents have b een completed with network providers (see Attachment G). Additional agreements are to be put in place following the award of a Care Coordination contract from and prior to commence ment of enrollment of individuals in the care coordination service. C. Business Associate Agreement Macon County Care Coordination has executed HIPPA-required Business Associate Agreements between Macon County Care Coordination and each of the core collaborators/service providers prior to the due date of this Solicitation response. Business Associate Agreements will be completed with network providers following contract award by DHFS and prior to the beginning of enrollment. D. Letter of Support and Interest to Participate Southern Illinois University Healthcare has provided a letter of support and interest to participate in care coordination efforts. The Healthcare Clinic's Director, Dr. John Bradley, is interested in the development of the medical home concept within the Family Practice as a pilot project over the next year. St. Mary's Hospital has provided a letter of support and interest to participate in care coordination efforts. The Director of Behavioral Services ha s been actively involved in the development of this proposal. St. Mary's Hospital has offered the letter of support as an indication of its interest in care coordination and this proposal. 3.2.1.6 Describe additional resource s available to the CCE or MCCN to assist in implementation or operation of your care coordinat ion model (funds committed by coll aborators, Federal Innovations grants, private grants, etc.). The following describes the resources that each of the core collaborators is prepared to contribute to assist in implementation of Ma con County Care Coordination. The Macon County Mental Health Board (the Board): The Board, as the lead organization for Macon County Care Coordination, has contributed to project start up. Board funds have been used, to date, to support the establishment of an initial health information exchange process through a web-based system with controlled and secure access and adaptation of a care coordination software package for use in starting and operating secure storage of centralized care coordination health informatio n and management of care coordination functions. 14 In addition, the Board, as a local funder of ment al health and substance abuse services, currently contracts with 21 community agencies and expends in excess of $2.8 million in the purchase of services locally. Several of these existing contra cts are focused on the ta rget populations of the seriously mentally ill, seniors with chronic health conditions and the children and families of these two target populations, as identified in this Solicitation response. The Board has, over time, designed contracts with providers that are targeted to clos e apparent gaps in the local service network and facilitate integration of services. A number of existi ng contracts have been designed with the intent of filling service system gaps. The Board has also established a Local Funds Initiative through which three local Medicaid certified organizations (Heritage Behavioral Health Center, Webster Cantrell Hall and Youth Advocate Program) may provide Medicaid mental health services to Medicaid-eligible individuals, as defined in DHS/Division of Mental Health Rule 132. The Board has designed program contracts to maximize the use of local funds as matching funds for Medicaid mental health services.

Financial and administrativ e management of care coordination functions w ill be provided by the Macon County Mental Health Board, in its role as the Lead organization for the Collaboration. The Mental Health Board, as a unit of local govern ment, has extensive experience in financial and administrative management of contracts with the State, with local service providers and other entities. It is anticipated that financial management of Ca re Coordination will include budgeting, payroll and expenses management for care coordinators, vouchering for per-member/per-month care coordination, financial and program reporting require ments for the Department of Healthcare and Family Services. The Mental Health Board has well established procedures for budget development and management, accounting, vouchering, payment fo r services provided, accounts receivable and payable, payroll management, contracting and sub-c ontracting, contract management and financial, 34 service and program reporting. All financial operati ons of the Mental Health Board are subject to audit on an annual basis. All financial and administrati ve functions of the Mental Health Board are considered as public information and open for review upon request. Subcontracts with the core collaborators of Macon County Care Coordination for work space, supplies equipment, etc. for care coordination staff to be located on site at core collaborator offices will be established upon contract award from DH FS. The board will also establish and manage any subcontracting arrangements with prov iders for service pr ovision incentives.

T he Council will be staffed by the Care Coordination Director and will be introduced as a bi-monthly proc ess in which the policies and operation of the care coordination program will be consid ered. These meetings will be sc heduled as lunchtime meetings. Lunch and transportation assistance will be offered to En rollee Advisory Council members. Frequency of advisory counc il meetings will be at the discretion of the Council, but at least quarterly. In addition to the input from the advisory counci l process, Care Coordinators will be expected to encourage Enrollees to provide input on an ongoing basis for quality improvement and will be offered the opportunity through a formal annual survey proc ess to provide feedback to the Care Coordination program on their satisfaction with services an d recommendations for improvement in services. 3.2.1.9 Describe the experience of your collabor ators in serving the needs and coordinating the care of the population you propose to serve. Macon County Mental Health Board: The Mental Health Board is a specialized unit of government charged with administering the county mental health tax levy. The Board purchases mental health, substance abuse and developmental disabilities services which are made available to Macon County citizens. Additionally, the Board serves a planning func tion in which community needs are assessed. Finally, the Board administers State and Federal funds and has a contract with the State to manage a children's early intervention program. 35 The Board annually administers local tax dollars and state and federal contracts of approximately $4 million. The Board contracts with 22 local agencies for the provision of services to youth, adults and seniors across the disabilit y groups of developmental disabilities, mental illness and substance abuse. The Board's staff ha s been involved in multiple collaborative efforts over the Board's 40 plus year hi story, providing the seed funding for new programs, supporting existing programs, designing and re-designing programs to create a network of care and to further integrate services locally. The Board served as the impetus for developing a care coordination program. The Board also provides financial support and staffing for care management for approximately 100 individuals who live in seven supportive housing and group home settings in Macon County. The Board created Woodford Home s, Inc. (Woodford Homes) in 1975 to serve as a provider of supported homes for disabled indivi duals. Supported living, as a concept, permits the disabled adult to live independently in their own home rather than in an institutional environment. Support may include independent living skills building, medication management assistance, coordination of services, illness self-management, identification and use of natural supports, and use of community resources. Woodford Homes has successfully provided these services to disabled individuals for over 37 years. In 2009, the board created two additional not- for-profit entities to hold two 12-unit supported apartment buildings, had the buildings constructed and provided housing for an additional 24 individuals with mental and/or physical disabilities. Eight of these were individuals who had previo usly lived in Decatur Manor, the community's Institution for Mental Disease.

CHIC initiated outpati ent mental health counseling services in the early 1990's and has maintained a full-time or near-full-time staff counselor position since that time. A licensed Master's Degree social worker currently holds this position and maintains a full case load. CHIC established a strategic partnership with the Heritage Behavioral Health Center approximately five years ago which has led to the advanced development of an integrated primary and behaviora l health service offering. Heritage Behavioral Health Center counseling staff maintain and office and a caseload at the CHIC main clinic building, accepting referrals directly from CHIC primary care providers. CHIC provides primary care services on-site at two Heritage Behavioral He alth Center settings - the Heritage main clinic office and the Heritage drop-in center for home less and seriously mentally ill individuals. CHIC's chief executive officer has served as a professi onal trainer on topics related to successful 36 integration of primary and behavioral health serv ices for audiences of mental health center executive directors. CHIC's primary care provid ers are actively involved in service delivery and program planning for services to seriously mentally ill persons. CHIC is also a long standing member of the De catur Health Coalition which includes, as member agencies, St. Mary's Hospital, Deca tur Memorial Hospital, Decatur Community Partnership, Decatur Weed & Seed and the Macon Co unty Health Department.

The County seat, Decatur, has a population of 76,122, down 7% from 2000. While the Macon County community is considered as an urban area unde r U.S. Census classification, it is actually a rural environment with a mid-sized city located at its center. Populat ion distribution by race is as follows: American Indian/Alaskan Native, 226 individu als (.2% of (79.3% total); Other, 1,438 individuals (1.2% of total). The seniors' population in Macon County is 18,166. (2010 Census Data). Medicaid claims data supplied by the Department of Healthcare and Family Services for calendar year 2010 indicates that there were 1547 indivi duals with serious mental illness and 1727 seniors (age 65 or over) in Macon County who are receiv ing Medicaid-covered services.

Please see Attachment H for the proposed implementation plan, including the following categories of information. 45 3.2.3. Care Coordination Model 3.2.3.1 Provide your definition and approach to care coor dination, including your identification of any deficiencies in the health care market specific to your proposed population and geographical area and how your model will help overcome these deficiencies. Care coordination is a patient-centered approach to healthcare in which care provided to an identified population is coordinated across t he spectrum of the healthcare system, focusing on improved health outcomes, enhanced patient access, patient safety and patient overall wellness. Care coordination includes the provision of or arrangement for a majori ty of care around the individual's needs, including a medical home with a primary care provider, clinic -based services, inpatient and outpatient services, mental health and substance abuse treatment services, diagnostic services, access to specialist services, rehabilitation services and long-term services and supports. Care coordination target populations are individu als at high risk for poor health outcomes. Its functional orientation is on problem-solving. The c ontext of care is bio-psycho-social rather than exclusively medical. It seeks to facilitate access to needed service for enrollees. Service access includes both covered (Medicaid, Medicare) and non-covered se rvices. The nature of care coordination is to promote coordination and communication of social support and medical service across different organizations and providers. Care Coordination and Medicaid Managed Care: Emerging Issues for States and Managed Care Organizations, June 2000. Margo Rosenbach and Cheryl Young. Coordination of care places special emphasis on managing the individual's transition(s) between levels of care and coordination between and among physical and mental health and substance abuse service providers. Care coordination engages th e community's healthcare partners in promoting coordinated quality care across provider and communi ty settings and provides for measurement of the delivery system's effectiveness and efficiency. Care coordination is interdisciplinary and includes relationship development, advocacy, outreach, social ization, service planning, resource coordination, problem solving, referral and linkage, evaluation an d record keeping. It includes direct and personal contact with the enrolled individual. It includ es oversight of a personal care program. A Guide for Housing Authorities and Their Collaborators Co-published by the Milban k Memorial Fund and the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, September 2006) The Macon County model of care coordination w ill emphasize reaching and care coordinating those complex enrollees at highest risk for poor health outc omes, in order to make gr eater strides in controlling costs and improving the quality of care and quality of life enrollees will experience. The model will operate from the pe rspective of a patient-centered medical home, considering the major providers and organizations with which a pat ent/client's medical home must interact -medical specialists, mental health and substance abuse provid ers, community service agencies, and hospital and emergency facilities. Full activation of the model will include assuming shared accountability for the 46 enrollee's overall health care, providing patient/cli ent support, building relationships and agreements among providers that lead to sh ared expectations for communication and care, and developing connectivity via electronic and other information pathways that will encourage timely and effective information flow between and among providers. Improving Chronic Illness Care, The MacColl Center for Health Care Innovation http://www.improvingchroniccare.org/in dex.php?p=Care_Coordination_Model&s=353. Macon County's healthcare system faces challenges t hat are similar to the challenges faced by other communities' healthcare systems. We have weakness in our ability to proactively monitor the health conditions of our patients/clients. We have limited ac cess to primary care providers for urgent care, with the hospital emergency departments se rving in a default position for urgent care provision. We have experienced poor coordination among prov iders at times. We have also pe rmitted discontinuity of service for patients/clients as they transit ion from one service to another. We have provided less than adequate guidance to our patients/clients for their illness self -management. We have, at times, provided unwanted care and less than nee ded support for families and care givers. Managing High Risk Patients in ACOs, Chad Boult, MD, MPH, MBA., Professor, johns Hopkins University, 2012. In proposing a model of care coordination, we are striving to address these deficits and pursue the further development of our health care deliv ery system, focusing on the following goals: - Information Continuity - the pati ents'/clients' clinically relevant information is available to all providers at the point of care and to patients through secure but accessible electronic health information medium. - Care Coordination and Transitions - Patient/client care is coordinated among multiple providers, and transitions across care settings are actively managed. - System Accountability - There is clear accountability for the total care of patients/clients. - Peer Review and Teamwork for High-Value Care - Providers both within and across settings have accountability to each other, review each othe r's work, and collaborate to reliably deliver high- quality, high-value care. - Easy Access to Appropriate Care - Patients/cl ients have easy access to appropriate care and information at all hours, there are multiple poi nts of entry to the sy stem, and providers are responsive to patients'/clients' needs. Geisinger Health System: Achieving the Potential of System Integration Through Innovation, Leadership, Measurement, and Incentives, Douglas McCarthy, Kimberly Mueller, and, J ennifer Wrenn Issues Research, Inc. The development of this model has opened a br oader understanding between and among the core collaborators, has initiated discu ssion about sharing of health information and has accented the need for closer collaboration in treatment planning and servic e delivery. The model, as planned, will bring the development of a centralized electronic information exchange vehicle for Enrollee healthcare information where care coordinators and providers of service can place treatment information accessible to all involved service providers and the enrollee. Care Coor dinators will also have the ability, under this model, to access health information as a user of each of the two community's hospital information systems (Please see Section 3.2.4, Health Information Technology). Care Coor dination will provide the opportunity 47 to share communication across tr eatment settings, will enhance ca pability to problem solve those situations in which service access is difficult fo r the enrollee and will offer the extra support that an enrollee may need to continue in the development of self-management of his/her illness. The Macon County healthcare system enjoys an advantage that other communities may not have. The geography and population of the community require th at we rely on each other as service providers. We are in a rural county with an urban population concen trated at the center of the County, the city of Decatur. About 80% of the population is concentrated in the city and almost a ll service providers are located there. As a community, we are approximately 50 miles away from other major service providers. Healthcare providers in the community recognize the need to communicate, collaborate and integrate services and operations. The core collaborators in th is care coordination effort share a common mission of caring for underserved and vulnerable populations. The Macon County Mental Health Board (the Board) w ill serve as the lead entity for this collaborative. The Board also serves as a funder of services and ha s existing contracts with over twenty local providers for mental health, substance abuse, developmental disabilities and specialized senior services. The Board has the ability to and has, historically, shaped t hese contracts to address gaps in care, incentivize collaboration and promote access to care and integr ation of services. For example, the Board has financially supported and encouraged the integratio n of medical and behavioral health care through contractual agreements with Community Health Impr ovement Center - the feder ally qualified health center, Heritage Behavioral Health Center - the comm unity's mental health and s ubstance abuse provider and the Macon County Health Department. The Board also provided financial supported for the integration of mental health treatment in the f ederally qualified health center, beginning in the early 1990's. The core collaborating service pr oviders in this care coordination project include both community hospitals, the federally qualified health center, the community mental health and substance abuse Medicaid treatment center and the community's Health Department. Each of these organizations is a key service provider for the target populations addr essed through this care coordination proposal. 3.2.3.1.1 If you are targeting Clients with SMI, please expressly indicate how your model design will meet the needs of that population and how it will interface with State-operated facilities. Macon County Care Coordination is targeting seriou sly mentally ill individuals. Heritage Behavioral Health Center, the community's Medicaid mental h ealth and substance abuse service provider, St'. Mary's Hospital, provider of medical, psychiatric inpatient service and Emerge ncy Department Services and Decatur Memorial Hospital, provider of medica l inpatient and Emergency Department services, and Community Health Improvement Center, the community 's federally qualified health center, primary care provider and Medical Home for this proposal, are co re collaborators in this care coordination effort. Macon County Care Coordination has established wri tten agreements with each of these organizations 48 for care coordination involvement, referral, and participation in Enrollee Care Plan development, treatment and information sharing. Heritage has a wide array of services for mentally ill individuals, including: assessment; psychological evaluation; crisis outreach and residential serv ices; case management services; supported and supervised residential services; psychotropic medi cation monitoring, administration and training; therapy/counseling and intensive ou tpatient services; community support individual, and team services; client-centered services; tr ansition, linkage and aftercare services, for individuals discharged from the state hosp ital (McFarland Mental Health Center) and local psychiatric hospital units (St. Mary's Hospital adolesc ent, adult and geriatric psychiatric units). Heritage operates a large drop-in center ne ar downtown Decatur for homeless and mentally ill individuals. Heritage also operates a health and wellness progra m for mentally ill individuals, supported through a federal demonstration program grant. St Mary's Hospital operates thre e psychiatric inpatient units - fo r youth, adults and seniors. These psychiatric units work very closely with Herit age Behavioral Health Center and have a collaborative process for treatment planning, discharge, linkage and transition for patients. Heritage has an assigned hospital liaison for the St. Mary 's Hospital psychiatric units. Both St. Mary's and Decatur Memorial Hospital Emergency Departments work closely with Heritage. Crisis Intervention staff from Heritage are routinely dispatched the hospitals at the request of the two hospital Emergency Departments for assessment of patients/clients, referral and follow up care. This activity occurs on a 24 hour basis, 7 days a week. In addition, if a patient presents at either of the Emergency Departments and advises that he/she is a current client at Heri tage, the assigned case manager or therapist, is dispatched, when possible, to the Emergency Department to assist the individual and the Emergency Department. Those patients who are adm itted to inpatient psychiatric treatment at St. Mary's Hospital are referred to the Heritage hosp ital liaison staff that, together with the attending psychiatrist, meet with and work with the patient du ring the patient's stay on the unit, and assist in formulating a plan of care and discharge planning to the patient. On an as-needed basis, assigned case managers/therapists may go to the inpatient unit to assist inpatient staff with treatment. The Care Coordination program has also solicited a Memorandum of Understanding with McFarland Mental Health Center, the regional state-operated mental hospital. The Care Coordination program has established a Memorandum of Understanding with Decatur Manor, the community's nursing facility specializing in intermediate care for mentally ill indivi duals. Some of their reside nts, class members of the Williams v. Quinn class action suit, are anticipated to be moving to locations in Decatur and Macon County in the coming years. Heritage Behavioral Health Center is in the process of contract discussion with the Department of Human Service's Division of Mental Health (DHS/DMH) to establish a Transition team to work with Decatur Manor residents as th ey are discharged from the IMD. The residents of Decatur Manor are included in Macon County Care Coordination's target population. The care coordination program anticipates working actively wi th Decatur Manor and Heritage in the successful 49 transition of those individuals discharged from Decatur Manor to independent and supported living arrangements. 3.2.3.2 Provide a detailed description of your care co ordination model and how it meets the needs of the population you propose to serve including: Macon County's model of care coordination is base d on a review of other care coordination models implemented with Medicaid populations and populations similar to the State's desired priority and target populations. The design is grounded in review and analys is of Medicaid claims data provided by DHFS, the observations of the core collaborators involved in this care coordination proposal and consideration of our system's needs for improvement. The Care Coordination program will consist of several activities, including: gathering of medical and/or behavioral health treatment serv ice utilization information; gather ing of medical and/or behavioral health treatment records; identificat ion of involved providers; intervie w with the prospective enrollee and significant others; engagement of the individual in care coordination through signed agreement and authorization for release of health information; completion of an evidence-based needs assessment and risk assessment; risk stratification based on evid ence-based assessment in struments and utilization history; identification of the enrollees' level of k nowledge about his/her health condition(s); assessment of the individual's level of illness self-management; devel opment, with the Enrollee and involved providers, of an integrated and individualized care plan; assignment to the appropriat e intensity of care coordination; advising all involved treatment parties of the avail ability and electronic access to integrated health information and a care plan for the Enrollee; coac hing, guidance and education to the Enrollee and family/significant others about the plan of care, the Enrollee's health condition(s) and medications; reconciliation of Enrollee medications, especially upon transition from treatment setting to treatment setting, with involvement of pharmacy services as needed; education on self-management techniques, including limit setting, dietary considerations, ex ercise, sleep needs; researching, finding and making referrals for needed community services and support s, including non-covered services and independent living needs like housing, food, utilities set up; de velopment and review with the Enrollee and key providers of a \"crisis plan\" that may be used when symptoms are exacerbated or acute suffering occurs, in order to avoid Emergency Department visits and/or hospital admissions; eval uation, re-evaluation and identification of change in the individual's functioning or behavior; active identification of gaps in service and advocacy for bridging these gaps; re-evaluation of the Enrollee's care plan with other team members and participating in plan changes; active communication with involved providers, sharing information and helping providers to view their treatment of the individual as a part of a broader effort to help the individual; modification of the plan of care based on Enrollee change in functioning and/or newly identified problems; and, advocacy for continued improvement in the individual's independence in living arrangement and self-management of his/her illness. 50 Macon County Care Coordination proposes to operate the care coordination program through a team approach. The patient is at the center of this team, s upported by friend, family or significant other and by a team of professionals. The team will be involved in collaborative planning for the patient, relationship development for improved communication and coordi nation of care and decision-making regarding services provided. Communication processes will in clude telephone, person-to person and electronic communication and exchange of information. The team, du ring the initial year of the proposed service, will include the patient and patient's friend/family; the primary ca re provider (providing the medical home); a Program director; a team leader (preferably an Adv ance Practice Nurse); a mental health specialist; a mental illness and substance abuse specialist; a so cial service specialist; and, three professional \"Navigators\" to assist the patient in navigating within a treatment organization or across treatment settings. Administrative support functions for fi nancial management, information systems management and reporting will be provided by the lead entity for the collaboration, the Macon County Mental Health Board. Each Enrollee will be assigned one primary care coordination staff member on the team as the \"go to\" person, while the whole team's expertise is available for care planning and care coordination activities. The primary care physician will provide patient evaluation and diagnosis, testing evaluation, medication prescription and review and referral fo r or conducting of specific medical procedures. The primary care physician may also be involved in illne ss education for the patient and/or family members supporting the patient's involvement in treatment by other providers. T he primary care provider will also participate in health information sharing for the i ndividual though the care coordination information exchange system. Information to be exchanged may in clude portions of the individual's medical record, including the physician's assessment, care plan and notes from office visits. The primary care provider will follow the patient through the course of his/her care. The Care Coordination Director will be responsibl e for supervision of st aff, ensuring the program meets its planned objectives, overseeing all require d data and reporting issues and conducting regular Enrollee Forums, seeking feedback for program improvement. The Care Coordination Director will be assisted by an Administrative Assistant who will be responsible for data inpu t for Enrollees, billing for services provided, operations purc hasing, payables and receivables. The Care Coordination Team Leader, an Advance Practice Nurse (APN) will work with the medical home and with specialist physicians, including psychiatric specialists for individuals with mental illness. In addition, the APN will be involved in patient and fam ily/friends education, follow up within 48 hours of patient transition from inpatient to outpatient or ou tpatient to inpatient se rvice settings, medication reconciliation and assistance in access to additional needed services. Transition monitoring and service coordination will include a review of information important to transition, including: the patient's diagnosis, health problems, the plan of care, any legal docu ments (authorization for release of information, guardianship orders, advance directives),the patient's \"health passport\" (a document that summarizes and highlights key information about the patient - See Attachment M), the discharge summary from the 51 discharging facility, any follow up appointments scheduled or in need of scheduling, any test results of pending results, the facility discharge instructions and recommended follow up services or supports recommended. Care Coordinat ion staff will be responsible for securi ng and transitioning information to the receiving provider. The mental health and substance abu se specialists will be actively in volved in care for those patients with mental illness or a co-occur ring substance abuse and mental illness. Heritage Behavioral Health Center has a comprehensive case management service for its clients. The Care Coordinators will work closely with the Care Coordination APN, the Heri tage staff case management staff, the St. Mary's Hospital inpatient psychiatric staff upon patient and both hospitals' Emergency Departments during care transition and on an ongoing basis. The Care Coordinator's responsibilities w ill include the development of the care plan for the individual, with the input and participation of the patien t, the primary care provider, the patient's significant others and the service providers involved in the i ndividual's treatment. The Care Coordinator will be responsible for building an integrated set of informat ion for the patient, soliciting treatment information from treatment sources and managi ng the accuracy and currency of this information. The Care Coordinator will also be responsibl e for relationship development with involved service providers and the proactive monitoring of the patient's functioning status. The Care Coordination Navigators w ill assist in gathering the patient's medical information, to be used for the information ex change process with all providers, will as sist by providing information to the patient and/or family members/significant supporte rs for treatment and service options and support the patient and family in the care plan's implementation. The Navigator will also make, coordinate and follow up on referrals to service for the patient. This serv ice referral and support may include medical and/or behavioral health services, but may also include arr angements to secure housing, food, household items, and other needed social services and supports. These ac tivities will require close coordination with the Heritage Behavioral Health Center's case management staff. Heritage's se rvice array is described later in this section of the proposal. Assessment will include an in-person visit by the Care Coordinat or. Assessment will include a review of medical history and current assessments of involved providers; review of serv ice utilization; screening for health and well-being, including nutrition, sleep habi ts and pain level; assessment of cognitive, mental and behavioral functioning; assessment of the indivi dual's self-management ability; review of current services accessed; consideration of potential addi tional service needs; and; discussion with current service providers. Assessment information will be organized and posted electronically for availability by all involved service providers, subject to the Enrollees authorization for release of information. This assessment information will become the basis for development of the individual's care plan. The Enrollee will be asked to identify his/her preferences treat ment goals and provided with best treatment options. The primary care physician and/or psychiatrist will pr ovide direction for clinical prot ocols for disease management. The 52 Care Coordinator and involved service providers ma y make recommendations for additional services. The care plan is constructed by the Care Coordinator, re viewed with the Enrollee for approval and consent. It is then posted electronically for access by the me dical home and involved service providers and is provided to the Enrollee in writing as a care plan wi th an attached \"health passport\". The health passport (see Attachment M) is a brightly colored and simplif ied document indicating key demographic and medical care information. Its purpose is to alert the heal thcare provider of the basic information about the Enrollee that is important to note prior to beginning treatment. The Enrollee is also provided with a Care Coordination identification card (see Attachment M) t hat may be presented at any health provider's office in Macon County, identifying the individual as an enrollee in Macon County Care Coordination. The identification card is intended as a symbol of the i ndividual's interest to work toward illness self- management. The health passport is an information v ehicle that an Enrollee may use to assist in transition from one service provider to another, and is intended to serve as a reminder to service provider's that the Enrollee is being serviced by multiple providers. Services will be provided at varying levels of intensity based on ident ified risk and need for services. Provision of services will reflect sensitivity to cultural, language, educational/literac y and accessibility needs. Care coordination service delivery and caseload management will be prioritized in a manner that addresses the immediacy of the participant's needs and identified risks. Care coordination will be offered at three levels, based on the Enrolle e's service utilization history, heal th and behavioral risk assessments, and ongoing service and support needs: 1. Intensive care coordination: Intensive care coordination serves the individual at high risk for poor health outcomes. The objective for this level of care coordination is support for recovery and a sustained decrease in avoidable service utilization and problematic symptoms, along with sustained progress toward an improved quality of life and a reduction or moderation of risk factors. This level of service includes frequent and multiple contacts with the En rollee and the Enrollee's medical home, service providers, family and significant others. It may al so include resource-finding and problem solving around obstacles in access to care or needed services and supports. It also may include active direct involvement with the Enrollee to support participation in healthcare services. Activity, for example, may include accompanying the Enrollee to a medical appointment or finding and taking food supplies to the Enrollee. Individuals in this risk category include those considered to be Medicaid's highest-cost beneficiaries, with multiple physical health problem s and significant socio-economic barriers to care (Hamblin and Somers, 2011) . This group includes: individuals with a serious mental illness and who have a chronic health condition or utilization history of chronic heart fail ure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) or coronary artery disease (CAD- including acute myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease, Alzheimer's disease/dementia, arthritis, atrial 53 fibrillation, cancer (excluding skin cancer), chronic renal disease, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), depression, diabetes, os teoporosis, stroke/transient ischemic attack, sickle cell anemia. Individuals with a serious mental illness and one or more admissions for inpatient services or Emergency Department services for serious mental illness or for one of the chronic health conditions listed above, within the previous 12 month Individuals with a serious mental illness and/ or with co-morbid medical condition, as listed above, with a utilization of Hospital Emergency Department services twice or more in the previous 12 months Individuals with a serious mental illness and prescribed five or more medications Individuals with a serious mental illness and a co-occurring substance abuse diagnosis who has used community mental health crisis unit services, or community substance abuse detoxification or residentia l rehabilitation servic es within the past 12 months Individuals with a serious mental illness and under 30 years of age. Individuals with a serious mental illness and discharged from a state-operated mental health facility Seniors admitted to inpatient services and assessed to be at risk for nursing home placement. 2. Supportive care coordination Supportive care coordination services the individu al at moderate risk for poor health outcomes. The objective for this level of care is the devel opment of resiliency, in which the Enrollee begins to assume responsibility for illness management, taki ng steps to reduce the risk of future service utilization, decrease risk factors and increase those activities that protect the Enrollee's health. Services at this level of care coordination includ e special attention to the Enrollee's transition from one service setting to another, active engagement with the Enrollee's service providers to monitor the Enrollee's continuing involvement in treatm ent services, anticipating Enrollee challenges and helping to construct planning that will assist the Enrollee in overcoming these challenges. This level of care coordination also includes regular personal contact with the Enrollee. Individuals in this risk category include: Individuals with a serious mental illness and/ or a chronic health condition, as listed above, Individuals with a serious mental illness and utilization of community mental health crisis unit residential services Seniors remaining at home 6 months followi ng hospitalization rather than admission to an intermediate care facility 3. Preventative care coordination. 54 Preventive care coordination serves the individual at low risk for poor health outcomes: Services at this level of care coordination include health education and illness self-management training for the Enrollee, referral to health and wellness activities and monitoring of the Enrollee's functioning. Individuals in this risk category include: Individuals with a serious mental illness and no utilization of inpatient services, hospital Emergency Department services, mental health crisis unit residential services and no substance abuse detoxificat ion unit services within the past 24 months. As the enrollee reaches a level of autonomy and takes on responsib ility for his/her own health and well-being, including the management of personal health needs, care coordination has successfully achieved its goal. At this level of independence, th e Enrollee may be considered for discharge from care coordination services. Special attention will be required to assure that the transition to follow up care is firmly established. (The Aetna Integrated Care management model: a managed Medicaid paradigm). In the event that an Enrollee is hospitalized, the Ca re Coordinator will visit with the Enrollee within forty eight hours of admission, will repeat visit and will participate with the inpatient staff in the development of discharge planning and will coordinate follow up services or monitor the implementation of follow up service as established. For seriously me ntally ill individuals, the Care Coordinator will work with the Heritage Behavioral Health Center Hospital Li aison and/or with the hospitals' social service staff and medical team. The Heritage Liaison typically sees the patient on a daily basis and makes arrangements for follow up care. The Care Coordinator will work in collaboration wi th the Inpatient liaison for implementation of post hospitalization transition services and follow up with the Enrollee after discharge, in support of participation in follow up appointments and treatment. The Care Coordinator will also, following either an Emergency Department visit or inpatient stay, review in person with the Enrollee the discharge instructions from inpatient or Emer gency Department settings and assist the Enrollee in coordination of follow up services. This follow up will occur within 48 hours of the individual's discharge from inpatient or emergency services. As needed, the Care Coordinator will provide reminders to the Enrollee for follow treatment and may attend follow up medical appointments with the Enrollee. For seniors, the Care Coordinator w ill work with the Heal th Department \"Startin g Point\" nursing staff, the Decatur Memorial Hospital Home Health staff, the St. Mary's Home Health staff and the inpatient social service departments of the tw o hospitals immediately upon hospitalization. The Health Department staff will conduct a screening for potential nursing home placement and identify and engage community resources for the senior, in an effort to deflect from nursing home admission and maintain the senior in his/her home and with family and so cial service support. Decatur Memorial Hospital Home Health Services has volunteered to provide services for those dually covered (Medicare and Medicaid) individuals following hospitalization at DMH, using the Coleman Model of care coordination. Under this model, the patient is encouraged to take a more active role in their health care. Patients receive specific tools and skills that are reinforced by their \"transition coach\" who follows patients across settings for the 55 first four weeks after leaving the hospital and focuses on medication self-management and uses a patient-centered health record that helps guide patient s through the care process. Follow up care is coordinated with the primary care provider and sp ecialist for follow-up. The patient is helped to understand the \"red flag\" indicators of worsening c ondition and appropriate next steps. The senior is engaged prior to leaving the hospital. The follow up care includes one personal visit and three telephone calls. A follow up call is made within 24-48 hours a fter discharge. This call is followed by a home visit within 48-72 hours of discharge to complete a post-d ischarge assessment and initiate any community service referrals. Follow up calls are made weekly ther eafter. The intent of the transition program is to help the Senior understand his/her medications, help in making follow up appointments, help in understanding when to call the doctor and help in putti ng together a personal health record that explains his/her needs to the primary care physician or othe r medical professionals. The Care Coordination APN will coordinate with Home Health sta ff, assist in securing community social services and su pports and will continue with coordination activities upon the DMH Ho me Health staff completion of their programming. Macon County's model will include the following esse ntial elements of care coordination services as Hamblin and Summer described In \"Introduction to Medicaid Care Management\" in Comprehensive Care Coordination for Chronically Ill Adults (2012). These elements are as follows: Stratification and triage by risk and need Identification and rapid linkage to physical, behavioral or psycho-soci al services for high-risk/ high- need individuals is a key objective of initial stratifica tion and triage activity with Enrollees, along with properly stratifying enrollees into intensive, supp ortive or preventive levels of care coordination service. Stratification efforts will use the review of Medicaid claims data, review of service utilization (including hospitalization, emer gency department visits, diagnoses, medications, substance abuse service use) to identify individual Enrollee high medical expenditures, hospitalization or emergency department visit rates, and existing diagnoses. An evidence-based health and behavioral health risk screening will be conducted for the Enrollee by the Care Coordinator upon enrollment and will be used to identify individuals at high risk for poor health outcomes and to prioritize need for and level of care coordination services. Referrals from providers or specialists and the Enrollee's own self-identification may also be used as a triage tool. Priority for care coordination service delivery to Enrollees will also be based on safety concerns and immediate needs identified, severity of risk and need, the Enrollee's motivation to address risk/need, the ability to provide services that lin k to the Enrollee's risk and are likely to have a positive impact on outcomes, and the Enrollee's ability to access othe r community resources available to offset the risk/need. In addition to planned stratification and triage activities, Macon County Care Coordination is very interested to participate with DHFS as it seeks to develop a predict ive modeling system which has the ability to predict future health outcomes ba sed on past behaviors of M edicaid enrollees. Integration of Services 56 Integration of services is considered to be is the management and delivery of health services so that patients/clients receive a c ontinuum of preventive and curative services, according to their needs over time and across different levels of the health system. For providers, integration means that separate technical services are provided, managed, and evaluated either together, or in a closely coordinated way. For the health care reci pient, integration is the degree to which they have access to seamless and easy to navigate care. Integrated Health Services - What and Why? World Health Organization, Technical Brief No.1, 2008. Enrollees at high risk for negative health outcomes generally have health care needs that require the services of multiple providers of care, potentially including primary care, specialist care, mental health and or substance abuse care, long term care and community supports (i.e., housing, transportation, utilities, independent acti vities of daily living, social ac tivity, etc.). Review of target population data provided by DHFS clearly sup ports the need for integrated care. Given the obstacles to care that seriously mentally ill i ndividuals and Seniors with chronic illness face, Macon County Care Coordination seeks to manage the care provided to an Enrollee through a collaborative approach to treatment; information shar ing - interpersonally and electronically - with all parties involved in treatment; joint care plan development; joint ownership of treatment responsibility; and, adjustment in level and intensit y of service in response to the individual's changing needs. Integrati on will be addressed through a number of activities. 1. The establishment of Macon County Care Coor dination, involving the core collaborators in a unified effort for provision of medical and behavioral healthcare. 2. Establishment of written memorandum of unde rstanding documents with providers as part of a network of care, outlining specific agreed -upon responsibilities and expectations for the delivery of and coordination of care for enrolled individuals. 3. Establishment of an electronic information sharing capability, with written agreement by network providers to share and use treatment information for care coordination purposes, established through a HIPAA-compliant Busi ness Associate Agreement and authorized by Enrollees through specific release of information documents. 4. Agreement between and among core collaborators on quality and performance measures, providing a shared responsibility for ev aluation of care. 5. Provision, through Macon County Care Co ordination for management and operation of the care coordination information system and fo r provision of care coordination services. 6. Co-location of medical and behavioral health services (discussed in more detail in Section 3.2.3.14) between and among the five core collaborating service provider organizations. 7. Location of care coordination wo rkstations at core collaborator service locations, in an effort to facilitate referral processe s and informat ion exchange. 8. Enhanced information sharing between and among core providers on program information, services, (including and admission and discharge criteria), referral procedures, designation of liaison staff at each core provider setting. These lia ison staff will provide the primary 57 connection link for care coordinators for communication about program and organizational issues will serve as a bridge to assist the Care Coordinator and the Enrollee in navigating within the service organization and provide su pport for the Enrollee to move from one service or service setting to another with easy transition. 9. Development, for each Enrollee, of a care plan, involving the Enrollee and all key service providers, focusing on an agreed upon set of goals. 10. Pro-active detection of barriers to care and fragmentation of care by the Care Coordinator and problem-solving, with the help of service providers, to break down those barriers and work to close identified care fragmentation. The key goal of all of the above activities is the establishment of an integrated system, defined by each individual's needs and provided within hi s/her family and cultural community. From the Enrollee's perspective, he/she is able to move from one level of care to another or from one service provider to another without breaking communicati on or treatment focus and maintaining a positive momentum toward illness self-management and improved health. The Aetna Integrated Care Management model: a managed care Medicaid paradigm\", Robert K. Atkins and Mark E. Douglas). Designated Medical Home (Medical Home) and personalized care planning. Macon County's model places the Medical Home as the central point in an Enrollee's care and a central point to facilitate integration of care. This Medical Home may be a primary care physician but may include a physician's assistant or an AP N associated with the Medical Home. The medical home for an Enrollee may be located with medical staff of the Community Health Improvement Center, or with primary care physicians associated with Decatur Memorial Hospital or St. Mary's Hospital. Although not currently operating as a medical home, the SIU Healthcare Clinic has indicated an interest to develop the medical home c oncept as a pilot program over the next year, in association with Macon County Care Coordination. The primary care medical home team is responsible for providing all preventive and primary care services to his or her assigned Enrollees and for partnering with the care coordination team and other providers that par ticipate in the Enrollee's care. The intent of the medical home is the provision of continuous care for the individual rather than episodic care when a crisis occurs, a proactive rather than reactive approach to treatment and a focus on the individual's self- management of his/her illness. Washington State's Medical Home Projects October 27, 2009 If the Enrollee does not have a medical home, he/ she will be provided with the opportunity to choose a location. Ideally, the enrollee should ha ve opportunity to select a medical home that provides the best opportunity for the enrollee to develop and maintain a relationship with the primary care provider. While enroll ment in care coordina tion is voluntary, the individual will be required to select or accept assignment to a medical home as a condition of care coordination enrollment. The default assignment will be with the federally qualified health center, Community Health Improvement Center. 58 The Medical Home is supported by a team-based approach to care coordination. The Care Coordination team, including medical home personnel, mental health and substance abuse specialists, social service agency personnel, care coordinators, inpatient hospital personnel and the Enrollee, work together to define care needs, develop, update, implement and adjust the Enrollee's plan of care. Personalized and integrated care planning addresses the individual's full range of needs, taking into account their health, personal, family, social, economic, educational, mental health, ethnic and cultural background and circumstance s. It recognizes that there are other issues in addition to medical needs that can impact on a person's total health and well-being. It is a holistic process, seeing the person 'in the round' with a strong focus on helping people together with their care givers to achieve the outcomes they want fo r themselves, for example to live independently or return to work. The plan of care should include community and nonclinical services as well as healthcare services that respond to the indivi dual's needs and preferences and contributes to achieving the individual's goals. This joint plan of care should include patient education and support for self-management and resources. Risk managem ent and crisis and contingency planning are also integral to the process of care planning, in particular for people with complex health needs . National Quality Forum (NQF), Preferred Practices and Performance Meas ures for Measuring and Reporting Care Coordination: A Consensus Report, Washington, DC: NQF; 2010. Enrollee engagement strategies All Care Coordination team members will participate in engaging and enrolling individuals from the identified target populations. As part of the enr ollment consideration for Macon County Care Coordination, all potential Macon County Care Coordination enrollees not currently enrolled in IHC (including the long-term care population, those wi th serious mental illness, Seniors with chronic illness, Dual Eligible individuals and the children in the family of the prospective enrollee) will be referred to the Illinois Client Enrollment Broker for eligibility determination and enrollment and will be required to select a primary care provider from within the Macon County Care Coordination network of providers. Macon County Care Coordination recognizes that there is a need to deal with existing socioeconomic barriers that impede access to care for the target populations. If an enrollee's basic needs are not being met, their health care and any medical conditions, including serious mental illness, will suffer. Care Coordinators may en gage with triage personnel (mental health crisis workers, Emergency Department personnel, inpatient and long term care personnel) to assist the individual with referral to services for basic needs like housing and other basic needs while working to engage the individual in care coordination. As high risk individuals are identified and enrollment is proposed, care coordinators will begin initia l assessment and triage for those individuals who have need for immediate care coordination activities. For seriously mentally ill individuals: The identification of high users of hospital emergency room services and inpatient services among the target populations will be a key part of initial engagement activities. It is anticipated that 59 elements of engagement in care coordination will include: 1) checking with partnering clinics and treatment settings where the indi vidual appears to be established for primary care or other treatment, to cross-reference and assure the most updated contact information.; 2) scheduling work and initial person-to-person contacts so that these contacts can be made at different times of the day, including evenings and weekends; 3) using th e spirit and method of motivational interviewing in interacting with these individuals; and 4) asking an individual from the clinic(s) where the individual is being treated to contact the indivi dual and encourage participation, if he/she is reluctant to speak with the engagement specialist . (\"King County Care Partners\", Comprehensive Care Coordination for Chronically ill Adults, pgs. 339-348) . Engaging potential enrollees will include referral for enrollment in Care Coordination from current caseloads of five of the Core Collaborators, all of which are key Medicaid service providers within Macon County. Support by the individual's ex isting providers will help promote participation. The Roles of Patient-Centered Medical Homes And Accountable Care Organizations in Coordinating Patient Care, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, U.S. Department of H ealth and Human Services AHRQ Publication No. 11-M005-EF, December 2010. Engagement of enrollees will also be requested through the Core Collaborators relationships through Memorandum of Understanding with loca l treatment and service organizations in Macon County, including; Decatur Manor - an Instituti on for Mental Disease; community social service providers, the Salvation Army, the Heritage B ehavioral Health Center Oasis program for the homeless and both community hospitals. These team members will be asked to provide names of individuals who may benefit from care coordination and assist in educating these individuals o the benefits of the service. Additional service provider s and referral sources will be identified and their participation sought as the care coordination program begins. For Seniors: Seniors will be identified upon hosp italization at one of the two lo cal hospitals. Referrals will be generated by the Home Health Care staff of Decatur Memorial Hospital, the Social Service staff of St. Mary's Hospital and the Health Department's \"S tarting Point\" program. As a result of care coordination planning activities, a newly developed process between Health Department personnel and the hospitals' social service personnel, senior s admitted to the hospital will simultaneously be referred to the Health Department for screening through their Starting Point services. Seniors identified as high risk for nursing home placement post-hospitalization will be prioritized for care coordination. Provider engagement strategies A review of Medicaid claims data has guided the focus of the care coordination planning. The key providers of service for the sele cted target populations of seriously mentally ill individuals and seniors are involved in the initial collaboration pla nning efforts. The community's two hospitals, the federally qualified health center, the mental heal th and substance abuse treatment center and the Health Department are the key prov iders of service in the community for the target populations. In 60 addition, the involvement of the Salvation Army and Decatur Manor were sought through Memorandum of Understanding. The Collaboration has reached out to the McFarland Mental Health Center, the state hospital for the central region of the state, and Catholic Charities, a specialized senior services prov ider, requesting that they each become a partner with the care coordination effort. Additional provider involvement will be reques ted as care coordination efforts begin. It is recognized that consistent proactive effort with prov iders will be necessary to facilitate integration of services and to facilitate information sharing. The Macon County Care Coordination's primary objecti ve is to provide care coordination that will effectively assist our target populations in se lf- management of their mental illness and/or and health conditions, improving compliance with pr escribed treatment protocols and medication regimens and increasing cost efficiency in the us e of Medicaid funds. It is recognized that health improvement does not typically proceed in a direct path. Seriously mentally ill individuals often see their symptoms ebb and flow. Seniors experience set-backs in health condition and management. Maintaining a care plan and maintenance of the appropriate level of treatment and care support are important to recovery and sustaining improved health status. It's hard work for an individual to gain control over an illness that has gripped them and incapacitated them. The support of a team of health care providers who is pulling together to help the individual is critically important for the individual's health improvement and maintenance. Information exchange among all stakeholders Just as patient-cente redness is an integral part of the program, so t oo is the ability to track care over time and across settings. Macon County Ca re Coordination will establish an electronic information exchange capab ility that will permit secu re access to Enrollee he alth information from any point of service that has access to the internet. As explained in Section 3.2.4 of this Solicitation proposal, health care providers will access specially adapted care coordination software, Streamline Healthcare Solutions, through a we b-host at the Macon County Mental Health Department's website, www.mcmhb.com . Access will be password protected and a second level of security will be further protected to permit acce ss to health information for specific enrollees. Care coordinators will be responsible for maintaining current and complete electronic health information for each assigned Enrollee expected to develop professional relationships with network providers. Care coordinators will provide system access training for heal thcare providers in the community and advise them of the value of inform ation exchange for improved healthcare for the Enrollee. Merely having an electronic exchange capability is not enough to help in coordinating health care for the individual. The health information system itself must prove to be useful and providers must use it to achieve the goals of coordination and high quality of care . 61 To support increased formal use of the el ectronic information exchange process and to enhance communication between and among service prov iders, Care Coordinators will be asked to establish personal relationships with the healthcare and social service providers working to provide services to the Enrollee. These personal relationship s will support the team effort for treatment and may be used to help providers become familiar with and see the value of electronic healthcare information exchange. Care Coordinators' resp onsiveness to the needs of the Enrollee and to requests for information or assistance from the provider will help make the information exchange process work more productively. Care Coordinators will also work with prov iders for establishment of protocols for Enrollee/patient transition from treatment setting to treatment setting. Collaborative planning efforts for system improvement may include development of shared or standar dized, evidence-based assessment instruments, standardi zation of the transition's info rmation exchange and content of information to be transitioned. Performance measurement and accountability Macon County Care Coordination plans to asse ss and evaluate the performance of a Care Coordination effort involving measurement of several keys areas of performance: Access to services - does the patient/client have access to services? Does he/she have the ability to select a primary care provider? Is acce ss to care culturally and linguistically appropriate? Does access to routine and urgent care during and after hours exist? Identification and Tracking - Does the program collect demographic and clinical information about the programs' participants. Are patient risk fa ctors identified? Are proactive and point in care reminders made to the participant? Planning and managing care - Are patients/clients with high risk and complex needs (including medical and behavioral risk and need) id entified? Is patient/client progress toward a goal assessed? Are barriers to treatm ent identified and addressed? Are pat ient medications reconciled as part of medical service and post hospitalization? Self-management and support - Are patients/c lients assessed for their self-management ability? Are they provided with a self-management plan? Are community services (including mental health and substance abuse services) and supports arranged or coordinated? Are they provided with health and wellness education? Tracking and coordinating - Are patients/clients tracked for follow up appointments, referrals, tests and services at other providers? Measuring and improving performance -Is patient utilization of services (i.e., hospitalizations, Emergency Department utilization) tracked? Is pa tient/client performance and experience data used for service improvement? National Quality Forum (NQF), Preferred Practices and Performance Measures for Measuring and Reporting Care Coor dination: A Consensus Report, Washington, DC: NQF; 2010 . Financial incentives aligned with quality care 62 Based upon review of Medicaid claims data and review of our own local service data and service patterns, Macon County Care Coordination proposes a combination fee per enrollee and shared savings model for the contract's first three years. The fee per enrollee model would include a stratified fee for the three identified levels of care coordination - intensive, supportive and preventative care coordination. All shared savings achieved through the operation of the program are to be reinvested in services to improve service access locally. Service supported through shared savings would be applied by Macon Count y Care Coordination, based on the experience gained through the care coordination effort and id entified gaps in service identified, and made available through a fee-for-service contracting ap proach with local healthcare and social service providers. Macon County Care Coordination is interested in accumulating experience in care coordination and would welcome the opportunity to discuss development of a capitated financial model with DHFS, after an accumulati on of operating experience. 3.2.3.2.1 Services Macon County Care Coordination intends to hav e the following services and providers for these services available in its network of care. All service providers ident ified are either core collaborators in this care coordi nation and/or have agreed to serv e as network service providers for the care coordination target population. In so me specific service categories, service shortages are noted and potential service providers have be en identified for further network development. - Primary Care Physicians: Community Health Improvement Center (CHIC) provides primary care for its patients, employing a Medical Director, staff physician and Advance Practice Nurses. CHIC Adult Primary care providers include Dr. Dana Ray - Family Practice, Dr. Michael Bell - Family Practice, Ayaz Ahamed, Physician's Assist ant-Adult Practice, Je ssica Sullivan, Practice, Debra Oestreich, Nu rse Practitioner-Family Practice.

CHIC also provides a Primary Care Clinic, located at the Heritage Behavioral Health Center's main bu ilding and its drop-in center, the Oasis program located in downtown Decatur. In addition, CHIC operates as a clinic on-site at the Macon County Health Center. As indicated earlier, SIU Healthcare Clinic is interested in establishing a pilot program through which the development of the medical hom e concept can be tested within the Clinic. Director Dr. John Bradley has expressed inte rest to develop this pilot project. The SIU Healthcare clinic was es tablished in 1978 at the Southern Illin ois University School of Medicine. SIU Healthcare is a group of nine faculty fam ily physicians, four Ph ysician Assistants, one 63 faculty Clinical Social Worker and fourteen resi dent physicians. Emphasis is placed on patient education and prevention of illness. Two physicians in the community are in the process of establishing a new private practice. Dr. Pabalate, formerly employed by the Community Health Improvement Center, is establishing new practice with an associate, Dr. Konda. These two physicians are currently accepting Medicaid patients. Upon contract award from DHFS, Macon County Care Coordination will discuss the possibility of their becoming service providers within the Ca re Coordination network and their interest in implementing the medi cal home concept within their practice. Decatur Memorial Hospital employs sixty eight physicians, including twenty one family practice physicians, eleven Hospitalists, and multiple specialists. St. Mary's Hospital employs 7 Hospitalists and has multiple family practice physicians affiliated with the Hospital. - Hospital Services: For seriously mentally ill individuals, St. Mary's Hospital operates three psychiatric units (adolescent, adult and gero-psychiatric).

A hospitalist will provide primary inpatient care coordination with the individual's primary care physician. Each hospital also provides social service discharge planning, referral and linkage services for individuals upon discharge. - Long Term Care: For seriously mentally ill individuals: Decatur Manor, an Institution for Mental Diseas e, is located in Decatur, the Macon County seat. While residents of this facility are members of the rece ntly-settled Williams class action suit, the facility has served as a long term care option for individuals with serious mental illness and is anticipated to do so for the immediate future. For Seniors - Macon County currently has tw elve nursing home facilities, providing both short-term and long-term care. The Macon County Health Department has close linkages with these facilities and serves as the \"starting point\" fo r an individual's entry into long term care and provides screening service for long-term care pl acement. In addition, both St. Mary's Hospital and Decatur Memorial Hospital offer a long term care setting. Future network development may include se rvice agreements with the community's intermediate and skilled care facilities. These facilities include: Aspen Ridge Care Center, Decatur Rehabilitation Health Care Center, Fair Havens Christian Home, Heartland of Decatur, 64 Heritage Health, Hickory point Christian Village, Imboden Creek living center, Lincoln rehabilitation, McKinley Court and Moweaqua Nu rsing Home. In addition, the community has eight assisted living and supportiv e living facilities, including: Ea st Ridge of Decatur, Evergreen Place, Hickory Point Christian Village, Imboden Creek gardens, Keystone Meadows, Primrose, Tanglewood Village, and The Glenwood. It is recognized that Aspen Ridge and McKinley Court have the highest volume of Medicaid benef iciaries living in their facilities. - Crises Care: Both of the community's hospitals are involved as Core Collaborators for this project and provide Emergency Department services. Herita ge Behavioral Health Center provides crisis residential services and 24-hour outreach crisis services, including on-site services from Heritage provided at both Decatur Memorial Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital Emergency Departments. In addition, Heritage maintains sta ffing on site at the County Jail from 8 am until 9 am Monday through Friday (with on-call and on- site service in the evenings and weekends). Heritage also operates a detoxification unit and interacts frequently with both hospital emergency departments and local law enforcement. - Transportation Providers: Network transportation providers include Decatur Memorial Hospital's Pr ime Time service, St. Mary's Lakeshore Connection and Catholic Char ities Faith -In-Action service.

Heritage Behavioral Health Center has an affiliate pharmacy, Genoa Healthcare, co-located at its main building and is in advanced discussion with them about an expansion of their relationship to include medi cation management services. Community Health Improvement Center and Macon County Health De partment have existing relationships with multiple local pharmacies. Historically, Dale's Southlake Pharmacy and Victory Pharmacy, located in downtown Decatur, have been very resp onsive to the needs of seriously mentally ill individuals and have delivery service as well. Macon County Care Coordination has identified five pharmacies, Walgreen's, Rambo, CVS, Wal-Mart and The Medicine Shop, that prov ide the largest amount of pharmacy services to the target populations and will establish work ing relationships with those pharmacies, upon contract award from DHFS. - Laboratory Services: These services will be provided through existi ng agreements and relationships of the Core Collaborators. Lab services are located at each of the hospitals and available through the federally qualified health center. - Work/Education Services: For seriously mentally ill individuals: Evidenc e strongly suggests that when an individual from the serious mental illness target population is able to be involved in work activities, health outcomes and stability of a mental illness impr oves. Heritage Behavioral Health Center provides the evidence-based practice, Individual Placement Services, as part of its ongoing programming. In addition, Macon Resources, Inc. a network provider offers a work program (psycho-social rehabilitation) at their wo rkshop and through job placement.

St. Mary's Hospital employs 7 Hospitalists a nd has a number of family practice physicians and specialists affiliated with the Hospital. 3.2.3.2.2 How you will address and monitor transitions of care, including appropriate follow- up, from: 3.2.3.2.2.1 Inpatient to Outpatient (PCP, Mental Health Providers, and Substance Abuse Providers); Heritage has assigned a very capable Inpatient liaison staff to work on-site at St. Mary's Hospital psychiatric units and maintains the practice of daily or multiple times per week on-69 site collaboration with the psychiatric unit sta ff and the Unit psychiatrist. Both Heritage mental health staff and substance abuse staff are present on the inpatient psychiatric unit at regular intervals. A Hospital liaison staff member has be en assigned to St Mary's Hospital psychiatric unit to support the Heritage psychiatrist as he/she conducts rounds on the psychiatric unit and serves as the link between Heritage and St' Mary's staff for discharge planning, linkage and aftercare for the Enrollee upon discharge from the inpatient psychiatric unit. In addition, Heritage Behavioral Health Center has a long-st anding relationship with the state hospital for this region of the State, the McFarland M ental Health Center and is under contractual obligation to the Department of Human Services' Division of Mental Health to provide linkage and aftercare services for individuals discharg ed from the state-operated hospital to the Macon County community. Care coordinators will participate in planning for Enrollee discharge from inpatient to outpatient servic es and/or monitor planned follow up scheduling. Follow up will include contact with the outpatient provider's office to confirm the Enrollee's participation in the follow up care and to determine and record the results of that follow up. If it is anticipated that the Enrollee may be relu ctant or resistant to participate in follow up appointment, the Care Coordinator may engage the Enrollee and ask to accompany the Enrollee to the follow up visit or may encourage case management staff or a family member to assume this role. A practice of \"firm linka ge\" will be required of Care Coordinators. This means that, while transition and follow up appointments are made, linkage is not considered \"firm\" unless the Enrollee has actually pa rticipated in the transition appointment. 3.2.3.2.2.2 PCP to Mental Health Providers and Substance Abuse Providers, and vice versa; The Care Coordinator will interact with primary ca re provider representati ves, either as a part of the Enrollee's visit with the primary care provider or through follow up with the primary care provider representatives to identify follow up ca re needs. Heritage Behavioral Health Center case management staff is actively engaged with clients of the Center and often attend primary care appointments with the individual. As coordinated with He ritage staff, the Care Coordinator may attend the appointment with the Enrollee or seek the assistance of a significant other to participate in the follow up appointment with the Enrollee. The Care Coordinator, if not in attendance with the Enrolle e, will follow up with the provider and with the Enrollee to determine that the Enrollee did, in fact, attend and will identify recommended next steps. In the event that the Enrollee is not a current Heritage registered client, the Care Coordinator will encourage and assist the Enrollee in accessing services. The transition from primary care provider to mental health and/or substance abuse provider is facilitated by the co-location of services between the Community Health Improvement Center, Heritage Behavioral Heal th Center and the Macon County Health 70 Department. Representatives of these organizations coordinate these co-location functions and meet on a regular, bi-monthly basis to review programming functions and to provide for trouble-shooting, problem resolution, and clos ing of identified treatment gaps. The Care Coordination Team Leader will participate in this regular discussion for purposes of care coordination. The transition from mental health provider to substance abuse provider in this community is unique in that the same org anization, Heritage behavioral Health Center, provides both sets of services. Heritage has it s own internal quality assurance programming to monitor effective transition from one service to another, however, the Care Coordinator will maintain a monitoring and quality assurance role in ensuring that successful transition has occurred. This will be accomplished in the same manner that transition from primary care provider to mental health or substance abuse pr ovider, through follow up with the provider to determine that the Enrollee did, in fact, a ttend and to learn recommended next steps. Enrollees will be encouraged to participate in service. 3.2.3.2.2.3 Outpatient (PCP and Mental Health Provi ders and Substance Abuse Providers) to Inpatient . Upon admission for psychiatric inpatient serv ices, Heritage Behavioral Health Center's Hospital liaison meets with the individual and participates in treatment planning care with inpatient staff. The Inpatient lia ison, working to gether with the inpatient psychiatric staff and psychiatrist, serves as the connecting rod th rough the individual's course of inpatient treatment, assisting in planning, facilitating di scharge planning for the individual and making necessary referrals for the individual's afterc are. During hospitalization, the individual's assigned mental health case manager may also visit the individual at the hospital and assist in planning for discharge. The Care Coordinator's role in this process will be to see the patient within 48 hours of admission, participate with inpatient staff and other involved parties in discharge planning, monitoring of the transiti on activities, requesting information from the inpatient liaison and following up with the individual and the assigned case manager upon discharge, to ensure that transition from inpat ient treatment to outpatient follow up with the primary care provider, and/or psychiatrist and assigned case manager has been achieved. This monitoring may also include ensuring that any referrals for social services in addition to mental health treatment are achieved. The Care Coordinato r may facilitate appropriate referrals or contacts, coordinating with the Inpatient Liaison or assigned case manager. Follow up contact with the Enrollee and assign ed Heritage case management staff will occur within 72 hours of discharge from inpatient psychiatric treatment. For those not currently registered Heritage clients, the Care Coordina tor will encourage the individual to engage in treatment services and facilitate re ferral and initiation of services. 71 Upon admission to impatient services for medi cal treatment, Care Coordination staff will be alerted by the Hospital's patient registra tion process for all patients enrolled in care coordination and advance-registered with the hospital. A part of enrollment in care coordination is completion of advance enrollment at each of the hospitals. The Care Coordinator will be responsible for visiting the Enrollee within 48 hours of admission, participating in discharge planning and providing follow up with the Enrollee within 48 hours following discharge. The Care Coordinator will review with the Enrollee the discharge plans, provide for medication reconciliation, if needed, and provide assistance in making arrangements for follow up care, including - if needed- accompanying the Enrollee to the follow up visit. 3.2.3.3 Provide a comprehensive statement of your proposed three-year staffing plan to demonstrate adequate support of your care coor dination model. Include organizational charts and detailed job descriptions for key staff. The Year 1 Care Coordination team includes a care coordination director and seven care coordinators, led by a Team leader, preferably an Advanced Practice Nurse who reports to the care coordination director employed by the Lead En tity, the Macon County Mental Health Board.

Care coordination assignments will be established according to Enrollee-sp ecific needs and Care Coordination staff specialization and skill se t. Care coordination caseloads will average 100 individuals however caseloads may vary among Care Coordinators based on the required level of care coordination per Enrollee. Intensive Care Coor dination requires a higher level of activity per Enrollee. A Care Coordinator with a higher number of Enrollees requiring intensive care coordination may have a lower total case load. Year 2 of the program will add tw o additional staff, a mental health specialist and a Navigator. This additional staffing will permit expansion of enrollment to 1000 individuals and maintain the average care coordination caseload of 100. Year 3 of the program will add an additional two staff, a me ntal health/substance abuse specialist and a Navigator. This additional staffing will permit expansion of enrollment to 1200 individuals and maintain the average caseload of 100. A full-time program director will provide the focu s and concentration to the program's effort to achieve cost savings and improved health out comes for enrollees. The employment of an Advance-Practice nurse will prov ide the guidance and training ca pability for other team members in the integration of primary and behavioral health issues for enrollees. The addition of mental 72 health, mental health/substance abuse and social se rvice specialists will provide the experience and understanding that will be nec essary for engagement of the pr oposed target populations and ongoing monitoring of functioning. The Navigators will serve in the role of monitoring enrollee function, and assisting the Enrollee in partic ipation in healthcare appointments, tests and activities.

CHIC has agreed to provide Macon County Care Coor dination with quarterly reporting of provider to Enrollee ratios primary care provider. 3.2.3.5.2 Mental Health Provider to Enrollees; Heritage Behavioral Health Center is the communi ty mental health Medicaid service provider for the community. The planned Enrollee to provider rati o will vary according to services provided, as follows: MI Adult Outpatient: 1:40 Case Management: 1:40 Intensive Case Management: 1:12 In addition, Heritage provides seven crisis unit beds, with 24 hour staffing, including nursing supervision. Heritage operates tw o group homes for the seriously m entally ill; the Orchard Street and West Main Group Homes with 10 and 8 beds, respectively. The Antioch Safe Haven facility/program has 7 beds and serves individuals who were homeless and provides them a lease without regard to their ability to pay. This mode l tolerates individuals who may be actively using drugs and/or alcohol (but not on the premises) and provides 24 hour staffing aimed at assisting the resident to gain employment, treatment servic es, and eventually to obtain their own home or apartment. Heritage has 3 permanent supportive h ousing sites (Heritage Fields, Heritage Grove, and Macon Street Apartments). Resident managers live at Heritage Fields and Heritage Grove and are available for facility emergencies. Clients ar e assigned case managers to assist with daily living skills, etc. Clay Street Apartments serves chronically homel ess individuals with a mental illness and/or substance use disorder. The group homes and Clay Street also serves veterans. Heritage's Housing programs served 168 individual s in FY 11. Heritage also works closely with the Macon County Mental Health Board/Woodford Homes with two permanent supportive housing projects, Charles Street and Came lot Apartments, serving individuals with serious mental illness. Woodford Homes provides supportive housing for 108 individuals in seven separate facilities. Heritage's information system has the ability to identify caseloads per staff member and total caseloads per program and for the organization. He ritage administration has shared this level of information on an ongoing basis and will provide th is information for care coordination program management. 3.2.3.5.3 Substance Abuse Provider to Enrollees; and 83 Heritage Behavioral Health Center is the communi ty substance abuse Medicaid service provider for the community. The planned Enrollee to provider ratio will vary according to services provided, as follows: SA Outpatient : 1:40 SA Intensive Outpatient : 1:40 In addition, Heritage provides 7 detoxification unit beds, one half-way house bed and 16 residential rehabilitation beds. Similarly, for substance abuse services, Heri tage's information system has the ability to identify caseloads per staff member and total caseloads per program and for the organization.

Dr. Damera (Heritage Behavioral Health Center Medical Director currently has 842 patients Carol Wood (APN at Heritage) currently has 215 patients Dr. Kavuri (consulting psychiatrist fo r Heritage) currently has 487 patients. Dr. Patil (consulting psychiatrist at Heritage) cu rrently has 418 patients. Dr. Patil is also the Medicaid Director for inpatient behavioral health services at St. Mary's Hospital and consulting psychiatrist for Decatur Manor, the intermediate ca re facility (Institution for Mental Disease). 3.2.3.6 Provide a detailed three-year budget as Attachment I that includes: 3.2.3.6.1 Revenue sources (projected care coordinat ion or capitation reimbursement revenue and other revenue sources); and 3.2.3.6.2 Costs (operations, staffing, health info rmation technology, performance incentive payments, estimates of reimbur sement distribution among collaborators, and other costs). Please see Attachment I for the three year budget outline. 3.2.3.7 To the extent that your model includes Dual Eligibles, describe your plan to address the specific needs of dually eligible populations. The dually eligible person is generally considered the most disabled and most expensive population served by publicly funded healthcare programs. They often fall into a fragmented care delivery system that leads to episodic rather than coordinated care. Information about their care and 84 their needs can be scatte red among providers and facilities facing two di fferent payment systems and sets of program rules. It is recognized that DHFS is not in a position to co nsider cost savings related to Medicare service delivery. Macon County Care Coordination has elect ed to include the dually eligible (Medicare and Medicaid) individual as part of the two identifie d target populations and believes that care coordination can help in improvements in access to services, improve individual health outcomes and, in total, reduce expense to the publicly-funded health system. 3.2.3.7.1 If your model to serve Dual Eligibles meet s the requirements outlined in Federal CMS' Managed FFS model, describe: 3.2.3.7.1.1 How you will promote seamless integration and access to all services in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, based on the Enrollee's needs, through coordination across both programs; and For the individual with Medicare and Medicaid coverage, Medicare becomes the primary payor, with Medicaid as the secondary payor. Dually eligible individuals tend to have disproportionately low incomes and tend to hav e greater medical needs, functional limitations and cognitive limitations than other beneficiaries. They are more likely to live in nursing home settings, more likely to have multiple inpatient stays and more likely to use Emergency Department services. A key to the integration of and access to servic es for dually eligible individuals is, as with Medicaid-only beneficiari es, the establishment of a medical home, and individualized care plan and support for that individual and the individual's medical home though a care coordination approach. Coverage and payment policies affect how beneficiaries receive their care and, so, influence access to care as well as the quality and cost of the care. Care Coordination staff will receive training in both Medicare and for Medicaid programs, in order to develop an understanding of current coverage for services and payment policies for dual eligible. 3.2.3.7.1.2 How you will assure access to all necessary care: As with those Enrollees who are Medicaid-only beneficiaries, Care Coordinators will advocate for services for the individual, make referral for services as guided by the individual's care plan and follow up on the individual's care received. Referral and follow up protocols established by the Care Coordination program will be followed for all Enrollees, regardless of payor source. 3.2.3.7.1.2.1 Is provided in a culturally and li nguistically appropriate manner; 85 As with Medicaid-only beneficia ries, services will be provid ed in a culturally sensitive manner, responsive to the individual and the i ndividuals' family. If need exists for special assistance for translation se rvices, the Care Coordinator will coordinate translation services through the Care Coordination team leader. 3.2.3.7.1.2.2 Includes caregivers, when appropriate; Caregiver involvement will be sought, based on agreement by or request of the Enrollee. The Care Coordinator's work includes bringing the maximum amount of support to the Enrollee in his/her effort to improve illne ss self-management and h ealth improvement. 3.2.3.7.1.2.3 Is provided in the appropriate care setting including the home and community; Care coordination is provided in the leas t restrictive environment possible for the individual, and focused on prevention of institut ionalization. Services currently provided by the Core Collaborators include home visiting and involvement with family and significant others. Care Coordination care planning will include the involvement of the individual's family, based on their desire for involvement. Heritage Behavioral Health Center has a contractual requirement with t he Department of Human Services' Division of Mental Health for the provision of home -based and off-site services. The Health Department is well integrated with the system of care fo r seniors in the community and provides a significant amount of home-based care, as does the Decatur Memorial Hospital's Home Health Service. In additi on, the local Department of Rehabilitation Services supports home-based servic es and may be a resource for Enrollees. 3.2.3.7.1.2.4 Is person-centered; and 3.2.3.7.1.2.5 Encourages consumer-direction. Macon County Care Coordination's Care Planni ng process is based on the involvement of the individual in the design and consent to an individual plan of care. The Enrollee's care plan is developed for the Enrollee, with the help of the professionals surrounding the Enrollee and the Enrollee's medical home. The care plan is developed with the Enrollee, focused on the Enrollee's improv ed health and on the Enroll ee's improved ability to self- manage his/her illness. The protocol for care planning and involvement of the Enrollee will be followed for all Enrollees, regardless of payor source. 86 3.2.3.8 Describe how you will mainta in a profile Enrollee that includes: 3.2.3.8.1 3.2.3.8.2 assessment, if applicable; and 3.2.3.8.4 Care management assignment, if applicable. Macon County Care Coordination will maintain Enroll ee information through the use of its electronic health information system. Access to relevant clinic al information in a timely manner is the key to identifying care needs, ant icipating future health risks, insuring positive health outcomes and avoiding negative health outcomes. Health information techno logy is viewed as an essential tool for care coordination. Information to be made available through Macon County care Coordination's electronic health information exchange system and for care coordination func tions, as developed, will include the following: 1. key socio-demographic information about the enrollee; 2. results of screening, asse ssment and risk assessment; 3. service utilization (hospital admissions, emergency room visits , outpatient visits); 4. primary care provider location; 5. care coordination assignment; 6. diagnoses 7. the enrollee's individual's Care Plan, including: care needs, goals and action steps; 8. case notes; 9. medications; 10. laboratory requirements a nd laboratory results data; 11. current primary and other healthcare provider contact information; 12. care coordination monitoring notes; 13. Scanned legal documents (Power of Attorney, Guardianship, Authorizations for Release). Each Collaborator, service prov ider and the Enrolle e will have secure access to an Enrollee's profile and Care Plan information. As individuals ar e enrolled, Care Coordination staff will complete consent for care coordination and necessary authorization for release of information forms, enter key demographic information about the Enrollee and solicit input from active service providers of all current assessment information. A Care Coordinator will be assigned by the Team Leader, according to the Enrollee's specific needs. The assigned Ca re Coordinator and supporting team members will review DHFS - Provided service utilization data a nd summarize this information in the Enrollee's profile. The assigned Care Coordinator will be resp onsible for conducting an initial risk assessment and coordination of the care planning. Included in th is process will be the Enrollee, significant others 87 as identified by the Enrollee, and representati ves from the Enrollee's medical home and current providers of service to the Enroll ee. The Care Coordinator will be responsible for documentation of planning. Active service providers will be request ed to provide, electronically, their assessment reports, case notes, treatment plans, lab reports (if any), and a listing of and updating of current medications, with appropriate authorization for re lease of information by the Enrollee. The Care Coordinator will be responsible for maintaining a curre nt roster of the primary care provider and all service providers, including cont act information for each, maintaining profile information for each Enrollee and securing all necessary signed release of information documents necessary for health information exchange. 3.2.3.9 Submit a sample Enrollee profile as Attachment J. Please see Attachment J for a sample Enrollee profile. The profile is presented as a series of input screens from the Macon County Care Coordinat ion adaptation of the Streamline Healthcare Solutions software that the Care Coordination pr ogram plans to use in implementing the program. 3.2.3.10 If you are proposing to operate as a health home and serve Clients eligible under Section 2703 of the ACA, describe: Macon County Care Coordination is not proposing to operate as a health home. 3.2.3.11 What is your approach to discharge planning and ensuring Enrollees receive appropriate follow-up services? Discharge of an Enrollee will occur under only three circumstances: 1. If the Enrollee expires; 2. If the Enrollee, after diligent effort, is not able to be located. Diligent effort includes at least three attempts to contact the Enrollee in perso n at his/her last known address, contact with the Medical Home and with each of the last kn own service providers, seeking new contact information or information about the Enrollee. 3. If the Enrollee reaches autonomy in health care self-management. The criteria for autonomy will be determined on an individual basis and with the Enrollee's input and agreement. If the Enrollee reaches a level of autonomy in healthcare self-management, he/she will be provided with a discharge plan that includes inst ruction for continuation in self-management, contact information for the care coordinator, for use if additi onal information is needed, a contact list of all recent and current service prov iders and a final review of pres cribed medications. Discharged 88 Enrollees will be offered the opportunity for re-e nrollment if the need exists. In addition, the discharged individual will be informed that a representative of the care coordination team will follow up in 90 days with a phone call or visit, to check on their continuing self-management. 3.2.3.12 How will your model of care decrease hospital readmission rates? Readmissions to the hospital may occur because of behavioral choices, such as non-compliance with dietary recommendations or medication regime. Re admissions may occur as a result of an adverse event that occurred following the init ial hospitalization or as a result of a lack of social support, follow- up care, understanding of discharge instructions, or communication following discharge. These may be considered avoidable readmissions t hat occur as a result of a brea kdown in the system of care. Individuals with multiple chronic health conditions a nd/or serious mental illness are at high risk for readmissions. Engaging providers and patients at eac h point along the system of care in efforts to improve communication, coordination, and discharge planning is essential to decreasing inappropriate and costly hospital readmissions. The transition from the inpatient to the outpatient setting is a critical point in which there is a real opportunity to prevent readmissions. For example, the provision of care by hospitalists has the potential to create discontinuities in care, both at t he time of admission and at discharge. Hospitalists may be unfamiliar with a patient's health and social hi story and, once a patient is discharged to the outpatient setting, the primary care physician may be unfamiliar with the rationale behind care provided in the inpatient setting. While the hospita list may try to contact primary care provider to discuss care and discharge plans, it is often difficu lt to communicate directly with community-based providers. And, additionally, the cu rrent payment system does not allow payment to both a hospitalist and primary care physician on the same day for ev aluation and management of the same clinical condition if the physicians are in the same medica l group and specialty. Care Coordination can serve as a bridge for communication through relationship development with the Hospitalist and with outpatient care providers and follow up to ensure that communication between inpatient and outpatient settings has been transmitted. The Hosp italist is considered as a part of team-based care, and the Care Coordinator provides an assist in tr ansmitting information across the transition from inpatient service to outpatient service. The posting of the discharge plan and related treatment information in the central electronic health information exchange and advisement to all tr eatment partners that th is central repository exists and is accessible serves as another impor tant communication vehicle. Maintenance of this information in a constantly current status provides value to those providing treatment for the Enrollee. All treatment partners are able to see what treatme nt has been provided in other settings and how their treatment offering may fit in with and complement other treatment services. 89 Although patients may receive inpati ent discharge plans from a nurse or social worker, they may not fully understand follow-up care instructions or have the ability to appropriately self-manage their care. Oftentimes, patients do not visit their prim ary care physician in a timely manner following discharge. Follow up calls or visits provided by the Care Coordinator may help to ensure that patients are receiving appropriate follow-up care. Care Coor dinators may provide or advocate for answers to any outstanding questions that the patient may have. Care Coordinators may also support the Enrollee's efforts to get to his/her follow up ap pointment by providing reminders, helping with transportation, or accompanying the Enrollee to the appointment. The care coordinator's role in this situation is to conduct a patient assessment within 24 to 48 hours after discharge, reconcile patient medications, ensure prescriptions are re-filled as needed and ensure follow-up care with the primary care physician or ancillary services within 4 to 7 days. Additional activities may include supporting timely follow up care; reinforcing compliance with di etary, medication or other regimes; contingency planning for crises; communicating with outpatient treatment sites; providing additional support; making treatment information available to all in volved parties; anticipating problems and pursuing problem solving. Reducing hospital re-admissions, Jenny Minott, Nov. 2008, Academy Health at www.academyhealth.org. An additional strategy for avoiding re-admission may include development of a crisis plan for the Enrollee, listing appropriate numbers to call when cert ain symptoms are presented, reviewing it with the Enrollee, in person, and posting it on the Enrolle e's refrigerator. For those Enrollee's identified as high risk for re-admission, another strategy is t he front-loading of follow up visits by the Care Coordinator and/or the individual's mental health case manager or home health nurse, to provide the extra support that may be needed in the day s/weeks following the hospitalization. 3.2.3.13 Describe the process for identifying mental health and substance abuse issues among primary care patients and ensuring the deliver y of appropriate mental health and substance abuse care. The Community Health improvement Center, as medical home, employs a depression screening as part of patient evaluation and routinely sc reen for mental health and/or substance abuse issues. In addition, the primary care staff has access to and refe rral capability through on-site mental health counseling staff and has used th is process on an ongoing basis. In addition, Heritage Behavioral Health Center has counseling staff on-site at the Community health Improvement Center and receives referrals directly from the primary care provider. All individuals referred by Heritage Behavioral Health Center have undergone a comprehensive mental health and/or substance abuse assessment prior to referral to the primary care provider. 90 3.2.3.13.1 Describe how you will educate PCPs in your CCE or MCCN about the importance of screening for mental health and substance abu se issues and the use of evidence-based practices in the treatment of Enrollees with SMI and substance abuse disorders. The Community Health Improvement Center has been highly invested in collaboration with the behavioral health service providers in the comm unity and has incorporated mental health and substance abuse screening as part of its as sessment procedures. The Macon County Mental Health Board has supported funding of mental health counseling services at the Community health Improvement Center sinc e the early 1990's .An ongoing formal set of interaction between the Center and Heritage Behaviora l Health Center has resulted in a high level of information exchange. The two organizations have inve sted significant energy to develop and evidence- based integration of services. The Care Coordination program will build upon this existing relationship and provide additional support to the medical Home and reinforce the importance of screening for mental health and substance abuse issues. In addition to the enhanced screening and treat ment processes that has developed between Community Health Improvement Center and Heri tage Behavioral Health Center, the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine's Healthcare Clinic employs a licensed clinical social worker who serves as an instructor for physicians of t he Practice and provides treatment services upon referral from Practice physicians. This clinical position has been part of SIU family Practice for over 20 years. 3.2.3.14 Please describe your plans, if any, to co -locate physical health and mental health or substance abuse services. The Community Health Improvement Center (CHI C) co-locates APN nursing staff at Heritage Behavioral Health Center for health screenings and work with the Heritage psychiatrists. CHIC also co-locates APN nursing staff at the Macon Co unty Health Department for health screening and consultations. Heritage Behavioral Health Center co-locates mental health counselors at CHIC and at the Macon County Health Department for assessment, referral and counseling. Two of the Core Collaborators, Community health Improvement Center and Heritage Behavioral Health Center have been engaged over the past thr ee years in an effort to integrate primary and behavioral health care. These organizations are usin g a conceptual model for integration called the \"four quadrant model\", a nationally recognized appr oach to service integration. The model is advanced by the National Council for Community Be havioral Healthcare and was initially developed by state mental health and substance abuse director s (National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors and National As sociation of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors) with the support of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Within this model, the 91 Community Health Improvement Center serves as th e medical home for patients. Heritage Behavioral Health Center serves as the behavioral health home for clients. The majority of these clients have the Community Health Improvement Center's physicians as their medical home. The tenets of this model are as follows: communication exists when each clinician caring for the patient shares needed clinical information about the patient to other clinicians also treating the patient; collaboration is multidimensional, requiring a shared understanding of goals and roles, effective communication, and shared decision making; care coordination is the outcome of effectiv e collaboration and corresponds to clinical integration; clinical integration is the extent to which pati ent care services are coordinated across people, functions, activities, and sites over time so as to maximize the value of services delivered to patients. (Report to Congress on the Prevention and Treatment of Co-occurring Substance Abuse Disorders and mental Disorders, SAMHSA, 2002) Through a SAMHSA grant, Heritage is integrating primary and behavioral healthcare with a team of two nurse care managers, one non-nurse care manager, a health and wellness coach and a Project Director. With a goal of 250 enrollees, 180 clients are currently serv ed. A physician assistant, who is a contracted employee from the Federall y Qualified Health Center (Community Health Improvement Center), is co-located at Heritage 20 hours per week. Heritage also has a counselor located at CHIC and at the Macon County Health Department, both supported with funds from the Macon County Mental Health Board). Likewise, Community Health Improvement Center has primary care providers co-located at two Core Collaborator locations (Macon County Health Department and Heritage Behavioral Health Center). Procedures have been es tablished among these three organizations for accessing, on a limited basis, healthcare information from each res pective organization's clinical records, based on appropriately completed releases of information. Al though this information exchange is not currently occurring electronically, the protocols for this e xchange have been under discussion for the past year. In addition, Heritage has an MSW Inpatient Liaison on the psychiatric inpatient unit at St. Mary's Hospital on a daily basis, providing case cons ultation, treatment planning, discharge planning and linkage to outpatient mental health and/or substanc e abuse services. Heritage also provides on-site services to individuals in the Emergency Depart ments of both St. Mary's Hospital and Decatur Memorial Hospital, at the reques t of the Emergency Departments. Th is availability exists 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Service includes assessmen t, consultation and referral, as needed. Further co-location is planned as the care coor dination model is implemented, in which care coordination staff will be provided work locations adjacent to each of the hospitals' Emergency Departments. This will permit them to access each of the hospital's internal medical information data, retrieve medical information about care coordination enrollees and will facilitate interaction with Emergency Department staff. Similarly, care co ordination staff will be provided work space at 92 Heritage Behavioral Health Center, the Health Department and the Community Health Improvement Center, to facilitate communication . Co-location will be facilitated th rough contractual arrangement for space usage between the core collaborator/prov ider and Macon County Care Coordination. 3.2.3.15 Describe the process for emergen cy department data utilization review and identification of Enrollees with high utilization. Each Enrollee's electronic health information gather ed by Care Coordinators will include utilization history. Emergency department utilization is a key part of this required data set. Each Enrollee's profile will include a review of Medicaid claims data and recording of all ongoing utilization of services. Those individuals identified as high users of emer gency department services will be prioritized for engagement and enrollment. Through agreement with the community hospitals, all Enrollees, upon enrollment with Macon County Care Coordination, will be pre-registered at both of the community's hospitals and associated with the care coordinati on program. Through this electronic registration and association by program, utilizati on reports will be aut o-generated by each hos pital's information system on a daily basis and notice of these reports' availability forwarded to the Care Coordinator's e- mail. The Care Coordinator will hav e the ability to log in to each hospital's information system on a daily basis to access these reports. In addition, regular management reports will be provided to the core collaborators from the care coordination information exchange system (See Section 3.2.4, Health Information Technology), indica ting utilization and utilization patterns. 3.2.3.16 Explain the strategies to address high em ergency department utiliz ation that you will implement. Emergency Department use continues to be a significant cost to the healthcare system, regardless of insured status, constituting approximately 50% of all hospital visits nationally. Medicaid beneficiaries, who would be uninsured without the public program, were much more likely to use the ER in a 12- month period and to have had multiple visits than the uninsured and privately insured. (Uninsured don't use ER more than insured, but Medicaid patients do. May 20, 2010, Lisa Scott Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), May 2010). Emergency departments are challenged by staffing is sues and, at times, availability of primary care and specialty consultant services. Emergency Department use for non-emergent care is very costly. The patient \"dis-incentive\" of increased co -pays has not seemed to significantly impact and deter the use of the Emergency Department. Dive rsion efforts have not had significant impact on reduction of and/or more appropri ate use of Emergency Departments. Strategies discussed most often in literature and research on the issue of Emergency Department over-utilization encourage the increased use of electronic health informati on exchange to provide data critical to improved 93 healthcare, the increased implementation of the medical home concept, capacity building for primary care and partnering between and among healthcare providers. Community Health Integrated Partnership, Emergency Department Over Utilization A New Paradigm? May 27, 2009, Salliann Alborn, www.chipmd.org. Macon County Care Coordination seeks to addre ss Emergency Department utilization issue at our two local hospitals though the expanded implement ation of the medical home concept, the further development of a healthcare/behavioral healthca re partnership of local collaborators, the establishment of an electronic health information exchange system that will permit health information exchange for enrollees and increased focus on communication between and among the Enrollee's service providers with a care plan that coor dinates service provider treatment efforts. Current practice includes on-site intervention at each of the two hospital Emergency Departments by Heritage Behavioral Health Cris is Service staff for psychiatric crises. The Crisis staff meets with the patient, assist the ED staff with recommendations a nd facilitate next day fo llow up by behavioral health treatment staff. Both hospitals provide elec tronic notice of a patient's treatment in the Emergency Department to the patient's pr imary care physician, if identified. Health care partners need 24 hour turn-around not ification of Emergency Department utilization, provided to the patient's medical home and care coordination program. The ability of Care Coordinators to access a daily utilization report as described above will indicate hospital services used by Enrollees at either of the hospitals. As protocols with the hospital partners become established, the Care Coordinators will become abl e to identify a specific cohort of enrollees who have high Emergency Department utilization, can reach out to them and/or can advise those providers in the network who are or recently have provided services to these individuals and offer opportunities to engage with those patients. A practice of next-day follow up with the Enrollee by the service provider and the care coordinator will be important in shaping the Enrollee's approach to managing health crises. Encouraging the Enrollee to use the services of the medical home and/or current service providers prior to development of a crisis and the development with the Enrollee of a \"crisis plan\" for future difficult times are additional tools for response to Emergency Department use. Moving away from over-utilization or inappropri ate use of Emergency Department services and toward preventative healthcare measures will require behavior modification on the part of patients as well as providers. The patient w ill need education on how to better manage urgent health situations, to learn to pay attention to warning signs of health problems and to be more pro-active in health management in order to avert Emergency Department service need. A closer relationship with the primary care provider and the Enrollees care coor dination team can help with this change in behavior process. The providers will need timely information on servic e utilization, the ability to exchange information about all current services offered and opportunity to learn about best practices for the individual Enrollee. The core collaborators in the Macon County system of heal th care providers will seek an improved partnership for healthcare delivery, involving the two hospitals, Heritage Behavioral Health Center, the Community health Improvement C enter, the Health Department and social service 94 organizations of the community. Reducing Avoidable ER Visits Jackie Huck, Community Health Network of Washington, 2011. 3.2.3.17 Describe strategies you will employ to promote wellness and encourage access to and utilization of preventive care. Promoting wellness for an individual with seri ous illness requires a co nsistent, caring and encouraging approach to care and support. Care Coor dinators will strive, through the application of motivational interviewing skills to encourage and reinforce positive efforts by enrollees to begin assuming responsibility for self-care and illn ess self-management. In addition, through communication with and exchange of information wi th service providers, Care Coordinators will encourage providers to reinforce en rollees in their efforts at positive self-management of their illness(s). Enrollees will be provided information ab out positive activities that promote wellness, including health education activities and social /rec reational activities. Care coordinators will also advocate for inclusion of enrollees in structured events provided by the community's social serve and other organizations. In addition, Enrollees will be offered the opportunity to earn small reinforcers for participation in regularly sche duled primary care and behavioral health care appointments and annual physical exams. Case Coor dinators will offer to accompany enrollees to annual physical exams and/or preventative screenings. 3.2.3.18 Describe how you will educate PCPs on t heir responsibilities for compliance with the American Disabilities Act. The Care Coordination program will be working most frequently with primary care providers in the federally qualified health setting, Community Health Improvement Center. The Center is required to comply with the Americans with Disabilitie s Act. Similarly, the SIU School of Medicine's Healthcare Clinic, as it begins its pilot medical home design, is required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. 3.2.3.19 Describe the strategies that you will utilize to address Potential En rollees who are very mobile, difficult to locate, homeless, or difficult to engage. The Care Coordination program has established a working relationship with the community's Salvation Army, as a network prov ider of services. The Salvation Army provides emergency shelter for homeless individuals, among other services. In addition, working relationships exist with other homeless shelters in the community. The core collaborators have been long-standing members of the community's Homeless Council, an organization chaired by DOVE, Inc. Heritage Behavioral Health 95 Center operates a drop-in center for homeless individual s, which is anticipated to serve as a referral source for prospective. Heritage Behavioral Health Center and both hospital Emergency departments have a well-established relationship with the City Police Departmen t. Care Coordination staff will be expected to engage in outreach activities, during the day, evening and weekend and to use any existing individual, social service or other relationsh ips in an effort to engage homeless and difficult to engage individuals. 3.2.3.20 Describe methods you will employ to ensure your care coordination model takes into account the culture of and the specific needs of the population you propose to serve. A goal of care coordination is to maximize ac cess to and benefit from programs, services and activities offered by providers to Enrollees , including those individuals who may experience limited English proficiency; those who are deaf or hard of hearing and prefer to use sign language; and/or, those who demonstrate unique in dividual differences along the dimensions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioec onomic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs or other ideologies. Staff recruitment and selection will reflect the diversity of the Macon County population and the demographi c composition of our target populations. Staff will be provided with education and training in cult urally and linguistically appropriate interaction and service delivery. Training activities will incl ude dissemination of information on workshops, classes, on-line learning and literature about dive rsity issues; organization of workshops and seminars about diversity issues; cultivation of a work environment in which individuals can be respected as individuals regardless of beliefs, cu stoms and backgrounds; review and analysis of data for personnel transactions and presented compla ints to ensure that personnel decisions do not violate equity and fairness principles; prom otion of awareness of and celebration of the cultural diversity of our staff, and clients (e.g., observance of religious holidays, culturally significant days and activities). 3.2.3.20.1 Describe how you will suppl y interpretive services for all key oral contacts and ensure that written materials can be easily understood by the various populations. When an Enrollee demonstrates a special language n eed or limited English proficiency, making it difficult to benefit from a Provider's services without some type of assistance, care coordination staff will obtain appropriate re sources, or make a referral to a provider, to obtain translator/interpreter, and/or other services (e.g., is deaf, blind, has cognitive impairments, etc.). Staff shall refer identified language assistance needs to their Team Leader. The Leader shall respond by securing needed specialized services. Bilingual/translation servic es shall be arranged through contract. Cost varies depending on language services required. Services may be 96 contracted for provision on-site at the Provider's offices. Services are available through Richland Community College, Millikin University, Universi ty of Illinois and private contractors. Core Collaborator staff include those with language skills in several languages, including sign language skills. Staff will be trained in re source availability and referral processes. Staff members will be trained to summarize/paraphrase in ways that do not cause embarrassment to clients with literacy deficits. Written materials will be tested with comprehe nsion-sensitive word processing software, targeting comprehension at a ninth grade reading level. Written materials presented in languages other than English will be reviewed by consulti ng Interpreter staff to ensure comp rehension capability. 3.2.3.20.2 Describe alternative methods of communica tion and how Enrollees will access these methods. Enrollees who have special communication needs will acce ss alternate methods of communication through involved service providers or through referral by Care Coordinators for specific communication services or aids. Herita ge Behavioral Health Center has the ability to access translator services through the Depar tment of Human Services. Macon Resources, a network provider, has ac cess to communication boards, as ne eded. The Care Coordinator will be responsible for researching services for identified communication needs and securing or advocating for access to those services for the Enrollee. 3.2.3.21 Describe any incentives you will allow PCPs and other Prov iders to use to encourage healthy behaviors and patient engagement in preventive care. Consistent with care planning for the individual Enrollee, the PCP and other providers will be allowed to use any incentives t hat are available through their own resources. Care Coordinators will advise providers if there are incentives bei ng made available through the care coordination program, permitting the service provider to re inforce efforts by the Enrollee to earn those incentives. Service providers may also establish c onditions, as part of their program planning with the Enrollee, for earning incentives or reinforcer s. Care Coordination staff will support service providers in this programming. 3.2.3.22 To the extent your model includes care coordinators, provide proposed care coordinator to Enrollee ratios and describe: 97 Three levels of care coordination will be provided. Care Coordinator to Enrollee ratios will be based on Enrollee health risk and intensity of care coordination activity. Intensive Care Coordination: The Care Coordination to Enrollee ratio will be 1:80. Intensive care coordination serves individuals at high risk for poor health outcomes. This level of service includes frequent and multiple co ntacts with the Enrollee and the Enrollee's medical home, service providers, family and significant others. It also includes resource- finding and problem solving around obstacles in access to care or needed services and supports. Specifically, it may include in-person vi sits within 24 hours of hospitalization and/or Emergency Department visit, active participation in hospital discharge pl anning, post-hospital visit medication reconciliation, in pers on support at approximately 72 hours post hospitalization and/or Emergency Department visi t, at least weekly follow along 4 weeks post hospitalization. Patient education may include ident ification of \"red flag\" indicators for health problems and use if crisis planning. It may include accompanying the Enrollee to follow up medical appointments finding and taking food supplies to the Enrollee or assisting in meeting other needs of the Enrollee during service tran sition. Care Coordination will also include regular dialogue with service providers working with the individual, comparing findings on the Enrollee's functioning, collaborative planning to anticipate problem areas or obstacle to treatment and advisement to the Medical home and other providers of high-risk concerns. Supportive Care Coordination: The Care Coordination to Enrollee ratio will be 1:120. Supportive care coordination includes regular week ly or bi-weekly contact with the Enrollee to monitor functioning, support and reinforce adherenc e to care plan, identification of potential obstacles to progress in treatment, responsi veness to Enrollee expressed needs, problem- solving with the Enrollee, advisement to serv ice providers of Enrolle e functioning. Health education may include discussion of \"red flag\" indicators, crisis plan use, symptom recognition, health and wellness practices and medication management. Health education may also include invitation or referral to health and wellness activities and responsiveness to Enrollee requests concerning health issues. Preventative Care Coordination: The Care Coordination to Enrollee ration will be 1:180. Preventative Care Coordination includes at least monthly interaction with the Enrollee for assessment of functioning, health and wellness discussion, invitation or referral to health and wellness activities, health education materials presentation, responsiveness to Enrollee requests concerning health issues. 3.2.3.22.1 How caseloads will differ depending on the needs of the Enrollees they are assigned; Enrollees will be assigned based on their primary identified needs. Those individuals with high- risk medical issues will be assigned to the Team Advance Practice Nurse. Seriously mentally ill 98 individuals will be assigned to Care Coordinators with expertise in mental illness. Those individuals with co-occurring disorders of seri ous mental illness and substance abuse will be assigned to the Care Coordinator with experience an d training in co-occurring disorder treatment. Those individuals whose needs are identified as in volving multiple social service provider services will be assigned to the Care Coordinato r with social service training and experience. Care Coordination Navigators will assist the Care Coordinators and Enrollees in coordination activities and will provide supportive and preventative care coordination activities. While caseloads may differ over time, ca re coordination activities will be similar across staff positions. 3.2.3.22.2 The qualifications of care coordinators and whether they vary depending on the Enrollee assigned; Qualifications for care coordinators will vary depending on the set of Enrollees assigned to the Care Coordinator and Care Coordi nation team responsib ilities. The Care Co ordination Team will include the following staff, with qualifications as described: Team Leader: This individual will be an Advance- Practice Nurse with experience working with seriously mentally ill individuals and knowledge of psycho-active medication administration, monitoring and training. Mental Health Specialist: Two individuals will serve in this role. These individual will have a Master's degree in mental health or a related field, preferably be llicensed as a Clinical Professional Counselor with at least 5 years of experience working with seriously mentally ill individuals, working knowledge of Medicaid mental health services, working knowledge of Medicaid substance abuse serv ices and experience in treating individuals with co-occurring disorders of m ental illness and substance abuse.

One of these individuals will have a Bachelor's degree and at least two years of experience working with geriatric patients or an Associate's degree and at least 4 years working with geriatric patients. Administrative Assistant: This individual will prov ide support to the program director and the Care Coordination Team. 99 All Care Coordination staff will be required to ha ve a valid Illinois driver's license and auto insurance. All staff will be required to submit to a criminal records and identity background check, verifications (I9, employment, education, refere nces and OIG exclusions) and driving record. 3.2.3.22.3 The duties of your care coordinators; and Care Coordinator Respon sibilities include: Establishing rapport and developing a relationsh ip with the prospective Enrollee (starting with initial contact); Identifying, evaluating and assessing, in coll aboration with the Enrollee, his/her strengths, resources, needs and priorities; Conducting health risk and behavioral health assessments; Developing care plans bas ed on Enrollee goals and in conjunction with the Enrollee and care team; Facilitate planning/problem solving wi th the Enrollee and significant others; Provide information, education and encouragement needed to inform and/or motivate the Enrollee to take steps necessary to change situations placing him/her at risk; Monitoring care plans; Managing and tracking goal attainment, assessments, lab results, and referrals made by the primary care provider - to ensure timely transmission of information; Coordinating and maintaining critical information sharing among the care team and Enrollee; Collaborate with other providers to assure continuity and coordination of care, and Promoting self-sufficiency and healthy outcomes (through encouragement and motivation, reinforcement of health care regi men, anticipatory guidance, supporting home safety, promoting continuation in health care, managing behavior concerns); Advocating on behalf of the Enrollee, including communicating to providers their strengths, needs and feelings. Ensuring that Enrollees are meaningfully informed about their care options. Care Team Responsibilities include: Supporting the medical home to coordinate care across the Macon County health care system including managing transitions between levels of care; Outreach and enrollment Involvement in development and implementation of care plans for Enrollees; Assisting in early identification, document ation, and communication of changes in health status of Enrollees; Providing self management training; 100 Ensuring behavioral health, social, and functional needs of the Enrollee are met; Identifying and making use of community re sources and services not covered by Medicaid; Providing Enrollee health education; and Assuring integration of services across settings and with the medical home, including Medicaid-covered services and social servic es and supports not covered by Medicaid. Communicating with all involved parties. 3.2.3.22.4 The training programs care coordinators may receive regarding cultural competency. Training activities will include dissemination of information on workshops, classes, on-line learning and literature about diversity issues ; participation in workshops and seminars, as available, about diversity issues; cultivation of a work environment in which individuals can be respected as individuals regardless of beliefs, customs and backgrounds; promotion of awareness of and celebration of th e cultural diversity of the sta ff, and Enrollees (e.g., observance of religious holidays, culturally significant days and activities). 3.2.3.23 To the extent your care coordination model includes any of the following services, describe how you will facilitate the delivery of appropriate health care and coordinate care between medical homes and: 3.2.3.23.1 Specialist services; Specialists have been identified through a review of Medicaid claims data. Each of the physicians who have previously provided Medicaid-covered se rvices are affiliated with and/or have privileges at one or both of the two core collaborator hospit als in the community. Each of these physicians has offices located in Decatur, most in close pr oximity to one of the two hospitals. Primary care physicians routinely make referral for specialist services, depending on the patient's needs. The primary care physicians located within the commu nity and specifically, the physicians affiliated with Community Health Improvement Center, make referral for specialty services, as needed, for their patients in an outpatient setting. The following are specialists currently providing services in the community. Cardiology: Dr. Manohar Kola, Dr. Lius Caceru s, Dr. Tansel Madhu, DR, Nidal Aker. Gastroenterology: Dr. Medicine: Dr. Perdekamp Grosse, Dr . James Wade, Dr. Ahmad Ahmad, Dr. George Duncan, Dr. Worlali Nutakor, DR. Theodore Addai, Dr. Hma Atluri, Dr. Dhirendra Patil and Dr. John Newlin. Nephrology: Dr. Mohammed Dawood and Dr. Muhammad Qureshi Neurology: Dr. Douglas Dove, Dr. Zaheer Ahmed, Dr. Tony Collins and Dr. Allen Devleschoward Neurology Surgery: Dr. Tom Fulbright, Dr, Oliver Dold and Dr. Robert Kraus Obstetric-Gynecology: Dr. Jeffrey Pfeiffer, Dr. T ony Amiewalan, Dr. Roy Tsuda, Dr. Adel Hanna, Dr. Derin Rominger, Dr. Gretchen Byrkit, Dr. Angela Anderson, Trevor Lineberry, Oncology: Guaglia none, Dr. Mario Velsco, Dr. Benjamin Esparaz, Dr. Phillip Dy and Dr. Justin Floyd Ophthalmology: Dr. Marcus Deranian, Dr. Gary Gillham, Dr. Orthopedic Brus Jeff Ken Tuan, Dr. John Britt, Dr. John Kefalas, Dr. Ed Raycraft, Dr. Ty ler Jones and Dr. Steve Huss Otolaryngology: Dr. Steve Sobel, Dr. Bethany Gibson and Dr. Azhar Aslam Otorhinolaryngology; Dr. Steve Chadwick and Dr. Terry Woods Pathology: Dr. David Johnson, Dr. Sue Strayer, Dr. Alan Frigy Pediatric Surgery; Dr. Martin Okpalike Pediatrics: Dr. Samir Patel, Dr. Solfia Saulog, Dr. Ben Dr. Christina Branham, Dr. Mayra Arzon, Dr. Mourad Alatour and Dr. Irfan Physical Rehabilit Wendell Beckman Psychiatry: Dr. Chourary Patil and Dr. Doug Ellis Pulmonary Disease: Dr. Jon Arnold and Dr. Carol Chen Radiation Oncology: Dr. Michael Bruin Radioogy: Dr. Bob Dodenhoff, Dr. Gene Forry, Dr. Howard Wiarda Radiology Diagnosis: Dr. Jeff Boorstein, Dr. Dr. Radiology Therapeutic: Dr. Mary Anne Depaz General Surgery: Dr. Steve Weber, Dr. Albert G ilamn, Dr. Doug Maibenco, Dr. Dwain Rogers, Dr. Tim Bailey, Dr. Scott Sherwood, Dr. Jeff Trachtenberg, Dr. Manuel Duron and Dr. George Liu Following are primary care physicians and Advance Practice Nurses currently providing services to seriously mentally ill clients of Heritage B ehavioral Health Center:. Amanda Shills, APN; Bell (CHIC); Phil Shills APN 102 (CHIC). Dr. Pabalate is no longer employed by CHIC but is in private practice with Dr. Konda. These two doctors are developing their practi ce and currently take Medicaid patients. The primary care physicians typically make t he referrals for specialist services. Heritage typically provides follow-up for registered client s and ensures the clients get to those specialist appointments. Care Co ordination staff will work wi th Heritage nursing sta ff, focusing on high-risk Enrollees, as additional support for the Enrollee's follow up for specialty services. The following specialists are currently providing services to Heritage clients: Surgeons: Dr. Peter Birk (most often) Dr. Brian Telle (one patient referred there) Pulmonology: Dr. Jon Arnold and Dr. Carol Chen Gynecology: Dr. Trevor Linberry Cardiology: (located in Taylorville, Illinois Podiatrist: Dr. Jason Anderson Heritage staff report that three specialty ar eas are difficult to access. These include Dermatologists, Neurologists and Dentists. This informatio n will be used by the Care Coordination team in an effort to advocate for expanded access to service in these specialty areas. The Care Coordinators role in accessin g specialty services includes advocacy for the Enrollee for specialty care services, assisting in planning for and arranging services and follow up with the Enrollee after specialty consultations , encouraging the Enrollee to pursue specialist recommendations. Advocacy for service provides an additional voice in support of the Enrollee, making the case for needed additional services t hat the Enrollee may not be able to express or may express without success. 3.2.3.23.2 Dental services; The Community Health Improvement Center has dental services for adults available through its affiliate office in Champaign, Illinois on an emerge ncy basis. The clinic works with the Community Health Improvement Center, Parkland College's dent al hygiene clinic and local dental offices. The Macon County Health Department has on-site, sc heduled dental services for children. The Health 103 Department and Community Health Improvement Center are core collaborators for care coordination and will assign liaison staff to work with the Care Coordination team for access to dental care. In addition, the following dentists in the communi ty have provided dental services to Medicaid eligible individuals, according to 2010 Medicaid claims data and may be asked by Macon County Care Coordination for inclusion in the network of providers for Enrollees: Dr. Paul Pladziewicz, Dr. Howard Stone, Dr. Lee Bennett, Dr. Aaron Parsons , Dr. Cliff Brown, Dr. Khin Laij, Dr. Mark Brunk, Dr. William Wall, Dr. Katherine Faber, Dr. Mi chael Lask, Dr. Lindsey Ingle, Dr. Kelly Clark, Dr. Richard Brown, Dr. Phil Jones, Dr. Bruce Wint ersteen, Dr. Paul Miller, Dr. Kathy Eaton, Dr. David Trost, Dr. Susan Goldstein, Dr. Ken We bb, Dr. Ryan Johnson, Dr. Susan Maurer, Dr. Bradly Bush, Dr. Lily Laij, Dr. Brian Hastings, Dr. Jonh Ferry, Dr. Todd Johnson, Dr. Howard Crystal, Dr. Mathew Bell, Dr. Thomas Fonner (o ral surgeon), Dr. Ibrahim Massoud, Dr. Denise Flynn (Orthodontist), Dr. Ajay Joshi. 3.2.3.23.3 Existing HCBS Waiver case management services; and Macon County Health Department and St. Mary's Hospital are currently providing HCBS waiver services for the elderly, supported by the Department of Aging. Catholic Charities and C.H.E.L.P. currently provides HCBS waiver services su pported by the Department of Human Services' Division of Rehabilitation Services. Although th is care coordination proposal will focus on seriously mentally ill individuals and seniors with chr onic health conditions, it is anticipated that an individual enrolled with Macon County Care Coordination may be involved in programming with C.H.E.L.P., Catholic Charities and/or St. Mary's Hospital. These social service and healthcare providers are involved with the core collaborator s in service provision on an ongoing basis and have been approached to serve as network service pr oviders. Existing referral mechanisms are in place between and among each of these organizati ons and with all of the core collaborators. 3.2.3.23.4 Other community agencies and services. The Care Coordinators will have access to a comprehensive listing of local community agencies and services and will be expected to famili arize themselves with these offerings. This listing of services is maintained through the Ment al Health Board's office. (See Attachment L, Community Resources) Service re sources are organized by catego ry of need (i.e., housing, food, etc. Because Macon County is somewhat a self-contained community, community agencies and their staff interact over time and develop working relationships that facilitate access to services. Care Coordinators will be expected to research treatment and service opt ions on a ca se-by-case basis, make connections for Enrollees where oppor tunity exists and advocate for service when 104 obstacles are encountered. Community agency prov iders engaged in service with the Enrollee will be asked to participate in t he care coordination network of pr oviders and in ca re coordination activities. 3.2.3.24 To the extent your care coordination model includes medication management, describe your approach to monitoring prescription drug us age including selected standards, models, and algorithms. The focus of medication management is on the e limination (or reduction of risk) of adverse medication/medical outcomes based upon drug interact ions, poly-pharmacy, and lack of coordination between multiple physicians who are prescribing. The Care Coordinat ion program nursing staff will provide medication reconciliation for the Enrollee at t he point of transition of care, from inpatient tor outpatient care, post-physician visit involving medica tion changes or other transitions, as indicated. Medication management will also include education for the Enrollee for self-management. Information for the Enrollee will include explanation of the m edication's mechanism of ac tion, what the Enrollee should expect as a benefit from the medication, t he side effects that may occur, any adverse effects that may occur, how to handle a missed or late dosage and any specific activities that the Enrollee should consider as part of self-management of hi s/her medications. The Care Coordinator may also help the Enrollee in devising a personal system for medication management, including a home storage system and a method for reminders for pr oper dosage, aimed at increasing medication adherence. The Care Coordinator may also assist in communication with the pharmacy for timely medication refills. Coordination of t hese support activities with the En rollee's case man ager at either Heritage Behavioral Health Center or the Health Department will support medication management, decrease risk of adverse reactions from drug interaction, poly-pharmacy or inadequate communication across providers. Heritage Behavioral Health Center, through its onsi te Genoa Pharmacy Service, is in discussion for the use of CMT's ProAct Analyt ics \u00e4 software. CMT's ProAct Analyt ics \u00e4 provides abstraction, aggregation, analysis, and interpretation of data, both pr ospectively and retrospectively, to aid clinical and financial risk analysis and management of a popul ation. CMT integrates behavioral pharmacy and services data, and medical services and pharmacy data and analyzes this information in respect to proportional financial risk, including adherence markers, gaps in care, medical- behavioral co-morbid conditions that are associ ated with elevated cost burden, and chemical dependency or underlying addiction or substance depend ency concerns. CMT also offers clinical guidance regarding cost and quality improvement oppo rtunities. Heritages interest is in reducing unnecessary behavioral health inpatient days, reduci ng behavioral health inpatient readmission rates, and improving rates of engagement in outpatient post discharge treatment. 105 3.2.3.25 To the extent your plan includes Enrollee health education plans, explain your plans and submit sample materials. Heritage has implemented the curriculum for Whole Health, Wellness and Resiliency program for seriously mentally ill individuals. Currently it is sta ff led, but The Center plans to gradually turn this responsibility over to clients with support from staff. Weekly group s are currently scheduled, are well received and well attended. Wellness activities contin ue to be added to the curriculum including, this year, smoking cessation, diabetic education classe s, and trauma sensitive yoga. Heritage's Health and Wellness coach has become certified in yoga , trauma sensitive yoga, smoking cessation, personal training, and zumba. Currently being held are six weekly exercise classes, 2 cooking classes, 1 nutrition education cl ass and 2 yoga classes using trau ma sensitive yoga techniques, 2 water exercise classes at the YMCA in the therapy pool, a smoking cessation and a diabetic education class each week. In addition, the health and wellness coach holds 1:1 exercise classes for 2 clients each week who are too obese to attend or who wish not to attend with other consumers. Three clients who were immobile are now mobile an d able to attend exercise group classes. Curricula in use include the Lilly Curriculum for Team Solu tions and Solutions for Wellness, an adaption to the In-Shape program, and a smoking cessation program , \"Learning About Healthy Living and You,\" by Jill Williams M.D. It is a collaborative curriculum by New Jersey Division of Mental Health Services, Robert Wood Johnson, University of Behavioral Health Care, New Jersey, and the School of Public Health at the Univer sity of New Jersey. Each of the Core Collaborators provides diseas e-specific education classes. The hospitals have extensive offering in each major disease cate gory, as do the Community Health Improvement Center and the Health Department. In addition to individual discussion with Enrollees and use of the core collaborators' education ma terials, the Care Coordination st aff will access ex isting health education classes and activities for Enrollees. 3.2.3.26 Describe your plan for monitoring quality of care provided to your Enrollees and providing ongoing feedback to affiliated Providers on their performance. The purpose of monitoring and evaluating chronica lly ill patients is to improve care effectiveness which has the potential to reduce their overall health care costs (Cesta and Tahan, 2003). The goal of care coordination is to empower the Enrollee to practice self-monitoring of his/her own health and to assess the quality of care rece ived, requesting additional assist ance as needed. Monitoring of the chronically ill individual's condition(s) is a comp lex process, involving disease-specific testing and skilled observation and diagnosis by professional s. The best case for monitoring is the paring of professional monitoring with the self-monitoring that the individual has learned to perform for 106 himself/herself. Monitoring can provide the advis ement to the healthcare provider for adjustment in treatment planning and implementation. It is recognized that self-monitoring is a difficu lt task for the chronically ill individual. For those individuals at high risk for poor health outcomes, the Care Coordinator, in coordination with the individual's case manager, if applicable, will assist in scheduling, coordination of on-going primary care visits. The continuing objective is to prov ide information to the Enrollee that will strengthen their ability to self-monitor and self-manage their illness. The Care Coordination program plans to provide quarterly reporting to the core collaborators on program performance and quality of care informat ion. Quality of care monitoring is a feature of the Streamline Healthcare Solutions software. Core Collabor ators will have acce ss and will be provided with program's performance on quality measures, number of Enrollees, hospitalizations, Emergency Department visits, trans ition activities -including timely follow up visits completed and medication reconciliations completed. 3.2.3.27 Propose at least one Quality Measure to be used as a pay-for-performance measure. CCEs must propose at least one Quality Measure for each financial reimbursement method requested (See Section 3.1.6.1.1). The proposed measure should be related to your proposed care coordination model, not already included in Atta chment A, and best demonstrate successful care coordination. See Section 3.4 Payment Terms and Conditions for more details. Macon County Care Coordination proposes, as a pay-for-performance measure: A. For the serious mental illness target population: # Category Quality Measure 4 Behavioral Health Support: 1) Follow up in 7 days Follow-up after hospitalization for Mental Illness B. For Seniors with Chronic Health Issues: # Category Quality Measure 5 Care Coordination Influenza Immunization Rate Enrollees who received at least one influenza immunization annually. 3.2.3.28 Describe the experience of th e collaborators using data to track utilization and to monitor Quality Measures. Community Health improvement Center 107 CHIC has an active QI/QA and risk management pl an. Committees meet monthly at each site; meetings are attended by the Medical and Finance Directors. Changes are made using the Plan, Do, Study, and Act (PDSA) performance improvem ent model. CHIC currently reviews evaluative measures in the clinical areas of diabetes c ontrol, controlled hypertension, PAP documentation, child immunizations, depression screening, dental services utilization, pre-natal health services utilization, perinatal health, weight assessment and counseling for youth, adult weight screening and follow up, tobacco use and cessation and asthma pharmacological therapy. CHIC also conducts an annual patient satisfaction survey. Decatur Memorial Hospital Decatur Memorial Hospital utilizes six sigma methodologies throughout the organization. All key quality measures are tracked using control charts to determine trends and alignment with predetermined goals for the measure . Heritage Behavioral Health Center Heritage Behavioral Health Center has a strong Information System that utilizes state-of-the-art systems, software, and standards in collecting, stor ing, and reporting client data. An Information Management Council oversees the planning, design, implementation and evaluation of Heritage's systems to manage and process information, in cluding an electronic clinical record (ECR) and integrated electronic billing system. The ECR wa s the first behavioral health center to ever be awarded the Nicholas E. Davies Award of Excelle nce for computer based patient record system in FY 2001 and remained the only behavioral health center with this distinction until 2006. Heritage has an excellent track record of collecting and r eporting on process measures for various State and Federal grants and is committed to the improvem ent of operations and use of team-based decision- making. Heritage has established a variety of cros s-functional teams, referred to as Councils, charged with gathering information, analyzing dat a, and making recommendations to improve its operations. These Councils report to and are coordinated by the Leadership Council. The Leadership Council also establishes time-limit ed cross-functional teams to study identified performance issues that need improvement. Heri tage utilizes the Plan, Do, Study, and Act (PDSA) performance improvement model. This model helps us decide whether to adopt, adapt or abandon a process. Quarterly, Heritage's Utilization Revi ew (UR) team conducts audits on a sampling of records to evaluate medical necessity for services . Quarterly reports are presented to Clinical, Corporate Integrity and Leadership Councils, wh ich make recommendations for improvement of identified problem areas (ex: additional staff tr aining or modifications in our processes). UM activities include monitoring the service de livery system to help ensure that available resources are utilized in the most efficient manner po ssible. To this end, C linical Council monitors the following items quarterly: 108 1. Number of individuals accessing treatment 2. Wait time from assessment to first visit 3. Utilization of high co st treatment: Crisis Stabilization, Detoxification, and Residential Rehabilitation number of admissions, length of stay, number of clients leaving against medical advice, and recidivism rate 4. Psychiatric hospital & state operated facilit y trends ; number of admissi ons, length of stay, and recidivism rates 5. Over/under utilization rates (ex: filled bed days, caseload size). Utilization Review (UR) is that process whereby a sampled set of client records are audited to determine whether each client has been properly asse ssed to need services and that the client has received the right services, in the right amounts, by the right staff, fo r however long it is clinically necessary to receive thes e services and no longer. Each Heritage program and/or level of care ha s written admission, continuing stay, discharge, and exclusion criteria, which define the information necessary to determine an individual's eligibility for entry into a program, service, and/or level of care. Heritage accepts individuals into programs and services based on these admission/exclusion criteria, as well as clinical assessment data, and according to established procedures and guidelines. UR audits focus on the following items, looki ng for medical necessity and the \"Golden Thread\" that connects all three documents: 1. The Mental Health Assessment to assure: a. the client's diagnosis is suppor ted by the DSM-IV-TR criteria b. that the client's signs and sympt oms result in functional impairments c. they meet admission criteria to the program they were referred 2. The Treatment Plan to assure: a. care provision b. the client's problems and functional im pairments identified in the assessment are addressed c. that the recommended amount, frequency and duration of interventions appear to be required to address the client's needs; neither too much nor too little given the client's level of functioning d. that the Treatment Plan is revised if the c lient needs more or less intensive services or at changes in level of 3. The Progress Notes to assure: a. interventions are listed on the treatment plan and linked to the b. appropriate objective being addressed c. treatment recommendations are being implemented d. the client's response to tr eatment and their progress or lack 109 e. document the need for continued services Heritage recognizes that certain items can have serious compliance consequences. For example they do not bill for services delivered if they do not have a curr ent Treatment Plan. To increase compliance with documentation requirement s, Heritage runs100% audits on the following items quarterly: a. Number of clients with no current Treatment Plan b. Number of mentally ill clients with no annual Mental Health Assessment c. Number of MI clients not seen in 90 days d. Number of SA clients not seen in 30 days e. Substance Abuse Level of Care service parameters Roles and Responsibilities The Leadership Council oversees the Utilizat ion Management process and empowers Clinical Council and Corporate Integrity Council to address the processes that take place throughout the organization. Leadership Council appoints the Co ordinator of Utilizati on Management who is the Director of Professional Development & Contracts Management. A.

Keeping Clinical Council apprised of OIG compliance and/or risk areas. 2. Reviewing quarterly UR and UM audits for trends, focusing on areas of risk. 3. A subcommittee of CIC is responsible for reviewing UR and UM findings and make recommendations for actions to be taken (ex: do we broaden an audit, go further back, self-disclose). D. The Leadership Council's responsib ilities include, but are not limited to: 1. Reviewing quarterly UR and UM reports that focus on indicators falling below established thresholds. 2. Based on UR and UM findings, approving performance improvement initiatives. 3. Annually review/approve the UM Plan and UR procedures. In addition, Heritage Behavioral Health Center and the Community Health Improvement Center (CHIC) have been involved in a SAMHSA funded Pr imary and Behavioral Healthcare Integration grant awarded to Heritage in October 2010 to furt her integrate behavioral health and primary care. Through this grant, Heritage's wellness program tracks data on connections to primary care providers of all consumers served by the team (research database). Data is reviewed to make sure all consumers served in the program have been connected (or an attempt has been made to connect the consumer) to a medical provider. Data from this database and the EHR is collected and analyzed on a variety of other factors, incl uding services received and health outcomes. Heritage regular utilizes data to drive and determi ne course of treatment both at the individual client level as well as within groupings of clients based on a variety of factors such as, diagnosis, functioning level, expected versus actual service deliver. Macon County Health Department The Health Department's Office of Health Promot ion and Public Relations is responsible for the completion of the state's required IPLAN (Illinois Project for Local Assessment of Needs) for health department certification in identifying and prioriti zing health concerns for Macon County. The IPLAN is completed every 5 years in planning for the next 5 years and has been completed and approved for the 2011-2016 timeframe. In addition, every y ear, the Health Department publishes an annual report with detailed information about the Health Department's programs, services, and client numbers 111 Macon County Mental Health Board The Mental Health Board, as a local funder of services, requires submission of demographic and treatment data from all providers under contract. Using this information, the Mental Health Board publishes, annually a demographics and service repo rt. As part of the contractual agreement for service provision, providers also undergo a mont hly or quarterly on-site record review and audit. Submission of service data and documentation is a condition for payment. The Board also contracts with three local agencies providing serv ices as Medicaid certified providers. These providers submit Medicaid claims through the Board-operated Solutions billing system. This billing information is reviewed and forwar ded to the Department of Health care and Family services for final edit and payment. In addition, The Board conducts monitoring site visits at each funded agency on a quarterly basis, reviewing documentatio n for compliance with contract requirements and verifying client eligibility for services. St. Mary's Hospital St. Mary's has a Quality Management Plan, which is an integrated, coordinated, and systematic program to identify opportunities to improve ca re, detect potential problems, prevent or resolve problems, and monitor effectiveness of actions ta ken. The Performance Improvement and Quality Committee correlates all quality information and look s for trends and methods of integration and for information of house-wide benefit to both internal and external customers. Among the duties of this committee are: To evaluate on a continual basis th e clinical performance of the Medical Staff and individual appointees through reports provided by co mmittees, patient care areas, and service line chairpersons; To provide oversight of the hosp ital's systems for process improvement, including clinical outcomes, evidence-based medicine, reso urce utilization, and patient safety; To provide oversight of the hospital's compliance with regul atory and accreditation standar ds pertaining to the Medical Staff. All these functions are highly data-driven. 3.2.3.29 Describe how you will impr ove access to care. Access to care involves both service availab ility and willingness to se ek care. The individual who has apprehensions about seeking care will postpone or avoid seeking health care. For the seriously mentally ill individual, this may involve a fear that seeking help will potentially result in restriction of rights or lo ss of freedom. Their illness may also impair their ability to make decisions regarding the need for health care. Likewise, for the senior, apprehension about seeking healthcare may be based in a fear of loss of independence. To address this apprehension or fear on the part of the individual, building of a trusting relation ship between the individual and the healthcare provider or facilitator is an im portant first step. Along with trus t building is the important skill of motivational interviewing, encouraging the individual to take action and seek treatment services and 112 providing education to the individual about the poten tial positive impact of treatment and beginning discussion about a plan of care for improved health. Education for providers about the inter-relatedness of health and behavioral health is an important aid for improving access to healthcare, especially for the seriously mentally ill individual. As the medical community becomes more familiar with the physical health concerns experienced by seriously mentally ill individuals, the more clear it has become that it is necessary to view the individual in a more holistic manner and recognize the need for a more integrated approach to treatment. Part of the Care Coordinator's role is education for both the Enrollee and the provider on the importance of combining the efforts of primar y and behavioral healthcare in an effort to improve the individual's health status and to move t he individual to more proactive self-management of his/her illness. 3.2.3.30 Enrollee Care Plan. Enrollee care plans are required for Priority Populations. To the extent your care coordination model includes Enrollee care plans for non-Priority Populations, please answer the following questions for those populations also. 3.2.3.30.1 Describe your approach to Enrollee care plan development, including: 3.2.3.30.1.1 The populations for which you will develop a care plan; 3.2.3.30.1.2 How each Enrollee's needs, goals, and preferences are identified and addressed; 3.2.3.30.1.3 Who develops and completes the Enrollee care plan and the process for collaboration; and 3.2.3.30.1.4 Your approach, if any, to risk stratification and how it relates to Enrollee care plan development. A single comprehensive person-centered care plan will be developed for each Enrollee. Those individuals assessed to be at highest risk will be prioritized for care planning and coordination of care. The Care Plan is based on the needs and preferences identified through an evidence-based health risk and behavioral health assessment process and will include: a listing of Enrollee's primary care provider and medical home, the assigned care coordinator and any specialty providers; a summary of the Enrollee's health history; the Enrollee's goals; the actions, including interventions to be implemented; progress noting the Enrollee's successes; any barriers or obstacles existing or anticipated; timeframes for completing planned care actions; 113 the status of the Enrollee's goals; crisis plans for Enrollees with behavioral health conditions; any determinations of need for community resources and non covered services; and any negotiated risk identification and documentation. In addition to serving as a guide for care provision, the Care Plan will be used to facilitate monitoring of an Enrollee's progress toward the Enrollee's goals and evolving service needs. Enrollees will be encouraged to participate in their own Care Plan development, including the selection of providers and services to receive or not receive. In addition, the Enrollee's primary care provider, the Enrollee's family and/or care giver and other providers of care will be requested to participate, according to the Enrollee's agreement. The Care Coor dinator will assume responsibility for coordinating this planning process and for the writi ng of the care plan, providing the opportunity for the Enrollee to confirm agreem ent with the care plan, dissemination of the Care Plan to the Enrollee and all providers and family or significant others, as requested by the Enrollee and posting of the Care Plan on the Care Coordination electronic health information exchange platform. This process recognizes that it may not be possible to bring all parties physically together for the planning process. The Care Coordinator will play the role of communicator, negotiator and organizer for bringi ng the input of multiple treatment providers together to form a single set of goals and interventi ons for the Enrollee. This plan will serve as the ongoing framework to guide integrated care, identifying the Enrollees needs, goals and preferences for care and treatment. Those Enrollees receiving preventative care co ordination services will receive a monthly visit or telephone call from the assigned Care Coordinator, for monitoring and to respond to any questions the Enrollee may have. In addition, indivi duals requiring preventat ive care coordination will be provided with disease-spec ific educational information a nd monitoring of functioning. 3.2.3.30.2 Provide a sample Enrollee care plan as Attachment K. See Attachment K for a sample Enrollee Care Plan, indicating the components of the Enrollee Care Plan. The Care Plan format is detailed in the Streamline Healthcare Solutions software (See also Section 3.2.4, Health information Technology). 3.2.3.30.3 Describe how the Enrollee care plan will be made available to Providers and Enrollees. The Enrollee's Care Plan will be provided to the Enrollee in writing and reviewed with the Enrollee by the assigned Care Coordinator. The Enrollee' s Care Plan will be made available to involved service providers through a web-hosted access point located at the Macon County Mental Health Board website. (See Section 3.2.4 Health info rmation Technology). Providers will be granted 114 secure access based upon their involvement in the Enrollee's Care Plan and with the Enrollee's consent to release and make this information available to the Provider. The Enrollee may review his/her care plan through secure access to the Macon County Care Coordination website as well. In those situations in which the service provider is unable to access the Enrollee's care plan electronically or is hesitant to use the elec tronic information exchange process, the Care Coordinator may hand-carry a hard copy of the Enrollee's care plan to the service provider and encourage the use of electronic access to the Enrollee's health information. 3.2.3.30.4 Describe your strategies to enhance Enrollee compliance with Enrollee care plans. The best method for enhancing the Enrollee's compliance with or adherence to the Care Plan is the development of an understanding with the Enro llee that the Care Plan belongs to him/her. The Care Coordinator's and the service provider's relationship with the individual is key to the development of the trust that will be needed to per mit the Enrollee to engage more completely in his/her treatment goals. In addition, the more edu cation the Enrollee receives and connects with in order to understand his/her illness, its symptoms and red flags, the better the engagement in the process of health improvement and the better th e adherence to the Care Plan. In an effort to encourage the Enrollee toward adherence, the Ca re Coordinators will be trained in rapport development, relationship development and motivational interviewing. In addition, the Care Coordinator will be trained to take advantage of existing relationships the Enrollee has formed. If a service provider's case manager has a close relationship with the Enrollee, the Care Coordinator should enlist the case manager's aid in motivating the Enrollee. Similarly, if a family member or significant other has the Enrollee's trust, this relationship becomes important to helping the Enrollee. In addition, as indicated in Section 3.2.3.17, Care Coordinators will encourage providers to reinforce enrollees in their efforts at positive self-management of their illness(s). Enrollees will be offered the opportunity to earn small reinforcers for participation in regularly scheduled primary care and behavioral health care appointments and annual physical exams. Case Coordinators will offer to accompany enrollees to annual phy sical exams and/or prev entative screenings. A difficult though important strategy for enhanci ng adherence to care planning is the use of the moment of crisis, in which the Enrollee is moti vated for change because of the difficulty of the health crisis. This moment of crisis can serve as a teaching and learning moment for the Enrollee and can have an impact on the Enrollee's underst anding of his/her illness and the importance of learning self-management of the illness. 115 3.2.3.30.5 Describe how you w ill coordinate Enrollee care plan development and implementation with Enrollee care plans and case coordinators serving Enrollees in HCBS Waivers. Providers of HCBS Waiver services will be advised by Care Coordi nation staff of an individual's enrollment in the care coordination program and will be asked to participate in the integration of planning for the individual. Waiver se rvice providers will also be ask ed to participate as a network provider for the Care coordinati on program and will be offered the opportunity for access to the care coordination electronic information excha nge process. Providers will be briefed on the activities of the care coordination program for the individual, other service provider involvements and the existing goals identified in the Enrollee's current care plan. 3.2.3.30.6 Many of the Enrollees may already be enrolled in IHC and may have an Enrollee care plan with the Enrollee's PCP. Describe how you will incorporate these ex isting Enrollee care plans into the development of new Enrollee care plans. For those Enrollees already enrolled in IHC and with existing care plans, t he care coordinator will seek consent from the Enrollee to discuss the care plan with the Enrollee's primary care provider, request the primary care provider's participation in a new En rollee Care Plan, and will seek the involvement of other service prov iders in the development of the new plan. Existing care plans will be used as a starting point for development of a new care plan. Analysis of the data provided by DHFS for 2010 indicates that, of the 1646 adults with serious mental illness, 735 were enrolled with Illinois He alth Connect IHC), 644 were dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and 177 were in a long term care setting, Decatur Manor. Ninety seven percent of seniors were identifi ed as dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Macon County Care Coordination will accept individuals for enro llment who are not excluded from participation in IHC and who are part of the target populations of serious mental illness and/or seniors with chronic health conditions. As indicated earlier, Macon County Care Coordi nation does not plan to serve non-priority populations. With the consent of the Enrollee, the Care Coordinator will seek information from the Enrollee's primary care provider, advise the provid er of the Enrollee's participation in the Care Coordination program, offer additional information to the provider of the Enrollee's involvement with other service providers and invite the pr ovider to participate in an expanded care plan development process that will incl ude the care planning that is currently in place through the primary care provider. 3.2.3.31 Outreach 3.2.3.31.1 Describe your plan for outreach to engage the population you propose to serve. 116 All Care Coordination team members will be invo lved in outreach activities. Several outreach strategies will be used to engage the target populations. - Staff of the core collaborators will be ask ed to refer those individuals on their current caseloads who may benefit from care coordinat ion services. Care Coordination staff will make presentations to core collaborator st aff groups, explaining the care coordination service. - Care coordination staff will research individual potential enrollee locations/addresses and seek face-to-face interactions to meet the prospective enrollee, begin relationship development and offer care coordination services. Outreach to these individuals will occur at various times during t he day, evening and weekend hours. - Care coordinators will seek out staff of co mmunity providers, aski ng those staff who may have an existing relationship with the prospective enrollee to provide an introduction to the program concept to the prospective enrollee and propose a meeting between the individual and a Care Coordinator. - Care Coordination staff may request assistance from Peer Mentoring staff employed by Heritage Behavioral Health Center to use th eir interactions with individuals who frequent the Oasis drop-in center and the Heritage \"L iving Room\" program setting as a place to discuss care coordination and engagement in mental health services. - Care Coordination staff will engage in some basic detective work, tracking down the hard-to-find prospectiv e enrollees, identifying family, signi ficant others who may be willing to help in discussion with the prospective enrollee about care coordination and scheduling a set of interactions with the i ndividual to begin the engagement process. It is recognized that outreach and engagement may be one of the more challenging aspects of care coordination, therefore a planned and me thodical approach with repeated attempts in some cases, must be used. Staff will be trained in motivational interviewing techniques and will work to develop relationships with more difficult to engage individuals over time. 3.2.3.31.2 Describe your staffing plan for outreach. As indicated above, all Care Coordination staff will be involved in outreach activities. Schedules will be varied to include evening and weekend outreach activities, in an effort to reach the potential Enrollee. Care Coordinati on staff will have the ability to meet potential enrollees on-site at provider locations, at the Enrollees home or at neutral sites in the community. Staff of the core collaborating organizations will also be asked to serve in an outreach role, advising prospective enrollees as they are encountered of the care coordination 117 program and making connections between the individual and care coordinators. Peer mentoring staff of Heritage Behavioral Health Center will also be asked to serve in an outreach role for care coordination. Peer Ment ors are individuals who are mental health care consumers well on their way to successful recovery who are employed by Heritage Behavioral Health Center, wher e they have been and are receiving mental health care, in order to help those with a similar diagnosis improve their level of functioning. 3.2.3.31.3 Describe the outreach process in your PCP offices. Primary care provider offices will be provided with an overview of the Care Coordination program at their clinic location by Care Coordi nation staff. The primary care provider offices and all service providers will be provided, via pr ogram brochure, with a description of the Care Coordination program, containing an abbreviated listing of care coordination functions and protocols. In addition, all providers involved in the local network of providers will have access to web-based training information on care coordination and a full description of the Care Coordination program. The Community Health improvement Center, by positioning Advance practice nurses part-time at Heritage Behavioral Health Center' main building, Heritage's drop in center for homeless and mentally ill individuals and at t he Health Department, currently provides significant outreach activity. Administrative staff of these organizations have regular bi- monthly program development meetings .Care Co ordination Director participate in regularly scheduled meetings, as part of an ongoing effort for further integration of primary and behavioral healthcare in Macon County. 3.2.3.31.4 Describe how you will ensure that writte n materials can be easily understood by various populations, including ensuring the accuracy of translated materials. Approximately ninety seven percent of the Macon County population is either of Caucasian or African-American heritage. Of the population in the community five years of age or older (103.844 individuals), 3,123 or 3% of Macon County residents speak English \"less than very well\" (U.S. Census, 2010 ). Within this community, the Hispanic population is slightly less than two percent. The Asian population is approximately one percent. Program marketing materials will be developed and published in English and will be developed to address an audience with an approximate ninth-grade reading level equivalence, using Micro-Soft reading level- sensitive software. An initial group of pros pective Enrollees from each of the target populations will be asked to review the proposed materials and provide feedback on comprehension and clarity. 118 A translated version will be created in Spanish and made available on an as-needed basis. Interpreter services for Spanish and other languages will be made available on an as- needed basis through service referral. Options fo r consultation and translation services exist through Richland Community College and the Univ ersity of Illinois Linguistics Department in Champaign, Illinois. In addition, the core coll aborators have existing staff with secondary language skills in several languages. 3.2.3.31.5 Describe alternative methods of communication you will offer and how Enrollees will access these methods. Additional alternate methods of communication will include: 1. Direct face-to-face method with Care Coordination staff or Core Collaborator staff, on-site at the individual's home or in an agreed upon meeting setting. If interpreter services are required, the care coordination staff will coordinate through the Care Coordination team leader for consultant translator services. 2. Written marketing materials (brochures, c ontact cards, introductory letters) made available through the intake and treatment processes of core collaborator service providers and other network providers. Written materi als will include a program description and telephone, office and e-mail access information. 3. Posted materials at network provider offices. 4. Access via internet to the program's websit e. Information available will include general program information, health education information and secure-access, password- protected Enrollee Care Plan and Health Care Information. 3.2.4 Health Information Technology (HIT) 3.2.4.1 Describe the technology capacity among t he collaborators (CCE collaborators/MCCN network) at the time of submission, including: 3.2.4.1.1 PCP communication capabilitie s to support their role in care coordination; Community Health Improvement Center (CHIC) In 2009 CHIC implemented the NextGen Practice Management System; and, in February, 2012 began implementation of their electronic health record (HER) system. The Dental Clinic in Champaign associated with CHIC uses QSI softwar e (the dental component of NextGen). Illinois Primary Health Care Association hosts the sy stem. CHIC is one of the planned nineteen (19) 119 members of the Illinois Health Center Controlled Network. This Network group meets monthly to discuss issues and is seriously studying possible migration to a new host. Implementation and overall system usage prov ed to be extraordinary challenging. Initial slowness of the system was frustrating to pr oviders and support sta ff. There was, initially, insufficient training available for support sta ff and lack of understating of what must be accomplished in terms of changing work flow processes. In the Champaign offices associated with CHIC, because of a \"quirk\" in their schedu ling methodology, it became necessary to bring all providers \"up\" essentially simultaneously. The sy stem's \"bugs\" are being worked out over time. With upgrades to the system, the hiring of a trainer experienced in instructing providers as well as support staff in the use of EHR technology and the presence at all sites of some enthusiastic providers, the Center has a consid erably better outlook for use of the EHR and development of skills and ongoing training to insure success. By the end of 2013 that CHIC will have made successful progress toward Meaningfu l Use expectations. As the Center moves toward complete use of EHR, policies are being formulated to address timeliness of documentation and tracking of outside referrals to assure adequate follow-up is in place. All of CHIC's primary care providers curr ently use NextGen for documentation and e- prescribing. 3.2.4.1.2 Mental Health and Substance Abuse Provider communication capabilities to support their role in care coordination; Heritage Behavioral Health Center Heritage has been developing an electronic record for approximately fifteen years. Heritage uses The Echo Group's Clinician's Desktop (CDT) electronic health record, Version 8.13, certified under the Drummond Group's Electr onic Health Records Office of the National Coordinator Authorized Testing and Certification Body program. This version adds the client's assessment, treatment plan, services docum entation and assessment tools, permitting measurement of progress. The Echo Group software, Version 8.2, captures Heritage client demographic information, bio-psychosocial assessments, treatment plans, progress notes and billing documentation. Heritage was awarded Primary and Behavioral Health Care Initiative (PBHCI) supplemental funding through SAMHSA for Federal Fiscal year 12-13, to expand the electronic clinical record whic h will enable Heritage staff and t he physician assistant (PA) to gather and share needed information between th e partnering agencies about the PBHCI clients. Upon grading to Echo Clinician's Desktop version 8.13 Heritage can begin using the features available allowing for easier navi gation, better security and the ability to share 120 information. Currently, the system is not in teroperable with our primary care partner, an FQHC, the Community Health Improvement Cent er (CHIC), who is in the early stages of implementing their electronic health record, NextGen. With this upgrade, Heritage will be integrating some of their data along with information about labs and medications. Heritage plans to use the PBHCI grant as a springboard for transforming its service delivery to become more fully integrated. The HIT grant will enable Heritage to expand staff access to electronic data on consumers' medi cations and doctors' orders. Currently, only nurses, physician's assistants, and psychiatrists have access to such data, but with the HIT grant, all clinical staff will obtain access to medical data in the EHR. This supplemental grant is being used to support the following goals: Partnering with a compatible e-prescribing platform creating a current list of medications in our clinical record. By the end of this 1 year grant supplement, at least 40% of prescriptions will be submitted electronically for Heritage clients; Enhancing and developing a certifie d electronic health record system to achieve Stage 1 EHR Meaningful Use Specifications will be accomplished by installing the 8.13 version of Echo's Clinician's Desktop that is certified for meaningful use; Becoming capable of sharing a continuity care record between our primary care partner, CHIC, and Heritage; Incorporating information from the primary care visit into our clinical record, preferably through a Clinical Care Report; Electronically incorporating lab and test results into our clinical record so that the staff treating the c lient could see tests results; Establishing methods for extracting data from the clinical record and impo rting it into the clinical registry; Continued participation in the development and implementation of the central Illinois Health Information Exchange to achieve improved health outcomes for patients. As noted above, Heritage cu rrently transports CHIC records for needed treatment information by the physician assistant. Port ions of the CHIC records are scanned, the Physician Assistant (PA) dictated reports, and te st results including labs, into our electronic health record. Heritage staff consult on a daily basis with CHIC staff and other providers (ex: laboratory or diagnostic tests completed at local hospitals), have telephone communication with the PA during off hours, when needed, make frequent phone calls with consumers to discuss treatment issues, remind them of appointments as well as health and wellness activities, and make or confirm appointment s with specialists and/or to schedule various diagnostic tests. Client referrals to the PB HCI program occur daily , mainly from case managers and the assessment team. PBHCI staff attend other Heritage staff team meetings to explain the program, discuss referral criteria, and address questions. In addition, Heritage currently has a business associate agreement with St. Mary's Hospital, permitting their Hospital Liaison sta ff to access St. Mary's Meditech system for registered clients of Heritage. This information exchange facilitates inpatient treatment planning, transition from inpatient to outpatient services and follow-up post hospitalization. 121 The inclusion of other healthcare treatment disciplines in information exchange for improved healthcare is a desired positive development. St. Mary's Hospital St. Mary's Hospital uses the Meditech Electr onic Medical Record system and has agreed to add Macon County Care Coordination to IT syst em as a business associate. All individuals who are enrolled in Macon County Care Coordi nation will be pre-registered with St. Mary's Hospital, associating registration with Maco n County Care Coordination, permitting auto- generated and custom-designed reporting via daily e-mail notification to care coordination staff. Staff would then be required to log-into Meditech and retr ieve their report of Enrollee use of Hospital services. Macon County Mental Health Board - Lead Entity The Board currently operates us ing a local area network for intra-office communications and e-mail for communication with individuals and organizations outside of the Board office. The Board also manages a website that serves as a portal for agencies under contract with the Board for service delivery, providing them the ability to submit service vouchers and service documentation via this on-line syst em. In addition, the Board is part-owner of Solutions, Inc., an organization of collaborating Mental Health Boards from several communities that has developed a billing software for Medicaid certified mental health service providers. There are currently three Medicaid-c ertified agencies in Macon County providing Medicaid mental health services and billing fo r services through the Solutions software. The Board provides the matching funds for these Medicaid mental health services and uses the Solutions software to provide billing to the De partment of Healthcare and Family Services under a Local Government Funds Initiative contract with the Department. The Board also hosts the Healthcare Solutions Care Coordinat ion software and is providing a portion of the funds necessary to adapt this software for us e by Macon County Care Coordination. The Board's website will serve as th e secure portal for service pr oviders to access the software application, upload and download Enrollee health information and will serve as the central repository for health information for Enrollees in care coordination program. The reader(s) of this proposal may view this website at www.mcmhb.com . Decatur Memorial Hospital: Decatur Memorial Hospital currently uses Healthcare Business Infomatics (HBI), a McKesson-designed system and has the ability to pe rmit healthcare business associates to access HBI. In a process very similar to that which is used at St, Mary's Hospital, Macon County Care Coordination can be added to HB I as a business associate, with care 122 coordination enrollees pre-registered with DMH. Registration with association to Macon County Care Coordination will permit the aut o-generated and custom-designed reporting via daily e-mail notification to care coordination sta ff. Staff would then be required to log-in to HBI and retrieve their report of Enro llee use of Hospital services. Macon County Health Department The Health Department does not currently us e an electronic health record system. They are in the development stage for system design. All staff have computer and internet access and will have the ability to access the care coor dination information exchange system via the internet and communicate about Enrollee health status in a secure electronic environment. 3.2.4.1.4 Indicate which collaborating or network Providers have registered for Electronic Health Records Payment Incentive Program payments wi th either the State or federal government . The following core collaborators have registered fo r electronic health Records Payment Incentive Program: Decatur Memorial Hospital St. Mary's Hospital Community Health Improvement Center 3.2.4.2 What is the expected HIT functionality of the co llaborators 12 months afte r Contract Execution and how will this capacity support your care coordination model? Macon County Care Coordination's goal at the 12 m onth mark of care coordination operation is the implementation and active use of a web-based clinical information exchange platform, using an adaptation of the Streamline Healthcare Solutions ca re coordination software. This design will enable sharing of patient-specific clinical information across partnering organizations for the care and treatment of individuals enrolled in care coordination. The software adaptation will provide a standardized electronic, informatio n exchange system that is access ible from all points of care. The modified Streamline Healthcare Solutions software package will be hosted by the Macon County Mental Health Board's website and will provide se cure access for the Enrollee and for all service providers, according to the Enrollee's formal author ization for release of information. The initial adaptation cost is being shared by three care coordination entities, t he Macon County Care Coordination program and two other CCEs. The intent of this adaptation is not to create an electronic health record, but instead, to develop a health information exchange platform and process. The Macon County Mental Health Board is supporting Macon County's adaptation and development costs. This software adaptation proc ess is anticipated to have the behavioral health 123 component in place by September, 2012 and the medical component in place by December, 2012. Customization of the softw are will occur over the first year of implementation, permitting modifications that allow for the uniqueness of t he Macon County Care Coordination program's setting and activities. The software information exchange vehicle will permit the Enrollee's plan of care and all additional health information to be accessible to the Enrollee, the Enrollee's designees, the medical home and all authorized service provi ders. This will permit the medical home and all providers to work from the same plan of care, and share responsibility for their contributions to the plan of care and for achieving the Enrollee's goals. Information exchange capa bilities, secure messaging and advisement of treatment adjustments for the Enrollee will be included as part of the adaptation. National Quality Forum (NQF), Preferred Practices and Performance Measures for Measuring and Reporting Care Coordination: A Consensus Report, Washington, DC: NQF; 2010. Macon County Care Coordination and its collabo rators represent a broad range of technology capacity, ranging from fully integrated electronic health record systems to custom systems supported substantially by manual processes. In order to bridge this dispar ity of systems (or technology) capabilities and provide the vehicle of coor dinated communications, Macon County Care Coordination determined that it needed to implement a common database and communication systems and processes. Two particular and complim entary web-based solutions have been identified: 1. Electronic Health Record system (\"EHR System\"), and 2. Custom Information and Communication E xchange Repository (\"Repository\"). EHR+ System: This browser-based application has achieved ONC- ATCB Complete EHR certification. In summary, its suite of applications includes the following: Electronic Health Record (EHR): HIPAA comp liant electronic health record for clinicians, supervisors, case man agers, doctors and nurses Practice Management (PM): Registration, scheduling, billing, accounts receivable, scanning and administration for providers. Managed Care (MCO): Provider contracti ng, authorizations, claims adjudication for managed care organizations. Medication (Rx): Integrated electronic prescribing for providers. 124 The emphasis of these applications has been on behavioral health. However, primary care functionality is being and will be in tegrated into this EHR system by the end of 2012. This integration meets the requirements of linking the various CCE co llaborator types together. The interoperability of the EHR System is reflected in its flexibility of providing access and data entry capability through direct data entry (DDE) and\\or through the importin g of standard record formats (i.e. 837Ps) as well as custom records uploads via flat text files( i.e. in .csv format). Em ail alerts will also be generated by the System to advise Collaborators of upcoming, key milestones or events. As part of the software adaptation, Macon County Care Coordination desires an information exchange for care coordination that includes the following: 1. key demographic information about the enrollee, 2. results of initial health screening and risk assessment, 3. service utilization (hospital admissions, emergency room visits , outpatient visits) 4. care coordination assignment, 5. the Enrollee's individual's Care Plan, 6. case notes, 7. medications, 8. laboratory requirements a nd laboratory results data, 9. current primary and other healthcare provider contact information. The EHR System will have the ability to collect at a minimum the following data areas: Enrollment\\De-Enrollment: Import of EDI270 from Illinois Client Enrollment Broker. Demographics 125 Screening, Assessments & Risk Assessments Care Plans Services/Notes Medications Care Plan Services \\Notes Medications 126 Repository: In addition to the System described above, Mac on County Care Coordination will be providing a secure, web-based system which will serve as a common repository for both the Care Coordination program and its collaborators for the exchange of related documents as well as well as communication on key issues. File sharing and the exchange of communication can be set at a one to one level (Macon County Care Coordination to a single collaborator ) or at a one to many (Macon County Care Coordination to network of collaborators) Functionalities for quality measur ement and practice improvement will be incorporated in the software adaptation and will include Enrollee and se rvice tracking capabilities necessary to establish and generate reporting that focuses on the following quality measures: a. Required Pay-For-Performance Measures 1. Emergency department visits per 1000 enrollees. 2. General hospital inpatient ut ilization admits per 1,000 enrollees. 3. Ambulatory care follow up visit with assigned PCP within 14 days of inpatient discharge. 4. Inpatient hospital 30 day readmission. M ental health readmission reported separately. 5. Proposed Measure A. For the serious mental illness target population: # Category Quality Measure 4 Behavioral Health Support: 1) Follow up in 7 days Follow-up after hospitalization for Mental Illness B. For Seniors with Chronic Health Issues: # Category Quality Measure 5 Care Coordination Influenza Immunization Rate Enrollees who received at least one influenza immunization annually. 127 b. Shared Savings - Pay for Performance Measures: 1. Enrollee who had an annual ambulatory or preventative care visit with the Enrollee's assigned PCP, or 2. Medication Review of All Enrollees taking 5 or More Prescription Medications with Documented Plan for Reducing Medications when Appropriate 3. Follow-up with a Provider within 30 days after an initial behavioral health diagnosis. 4. Proposed Measure A. For the serious mental illness target population: # Category Quality Measure 4 Behavioral Health Support: 2) Follow up in 7 days Follow-up after hospitalization for Mental Illness B. For Seniors with Chronic Health Issues: # Category Quality Measure 5 Care Coordination Influenza Immunization Rate Enrollees who received at least one influenza immunization annually. 3.2.4.2.1 Describe your connection to and support of: 1) PCPs, 2) Hospitals, and 3) Mental Health and Substance Abuse Providers; and All of the core collaborators' professional and administrative staff and service sites and the providers in the service network engaged via Memorandum of Understanding and completion of the Business Associate Agreement, will have th e ability to access the Care Coordination programming via the internet. E-mail communication has been the standard between and among these collaborators however, secure messaging will be the standard means of communication regarding care coordination enrollees, via a web-based care coordination software, Streamline Healthcare Solutions This software, has been adapted for use by Macon County Care Coordination and is hosted at the Macon County Mental Health Board's website. Streamline software and information exchange capability will be managed by the Macon County Mental Health Board's experienced syst ems consultants. Training to all providers in the network on access to, use of and up loading of data to the software applicat ion will be provid ed by the Mental Health Board's consultants. In addition, a user manual will be constructed, to be retained by all service providers at thei r point of service and point of data ex change. Care Coordination staff will be assigned as liaisons to each service provider, to serve as a contact point for system use issues and solution development. The assigned care coordination staff will also monitor the 128 information accumulated per Enrollee for exchange with other providers and assist and/or prompt providers to upload, post or review information. 1. PCP Community Health Improvement Center serves as the primary care provider and has the ability to interface electronica lly with a Care Coordination in formation exchange system via log-in through the Macon County mental Health Board web-host. This log-in procedure has been used by CHIC for the past two years in accessing the Mental Health Board's electronic vouchering system. CHIC staff are familiar with uploading information and documentation to this system. CHIC has a login user name and password permitting access to the Board's website. CHIC Medical Home and supporting staff, as pa rt of an individual's care coordination team, will be provided electronic access to the care coordination application. Access to specific Enrollee's health information will be secured and accessible only according to access privileges provided by care co ordination staff, based on the Enrollee's written, signed and electronically posted authorization for release of information to CHIC personnel. CHIC primary care providers and their supporting sta ff will be provided with a login user name and password permitting access to the application as release of information is authorized for release by the Enrollee. CHIC per sonnel will also be offered tr aining in system use, trouble- shooting options and system use documentation. Physicians affiliated with St. Mary's Hospit al and Decatur Memorial Hospital may serve as primary care providers for Enrollees. Care Coordination staff will need to reach out on an individual basis to each physician, in the inte rest of the Enrollee, to establish a working relationship and develop a process for health information exchange. It is anticipated that relationship development at the physician's office nursing staff level will be the starting point for this relationship. Educating nursing staff about the design, intent and process of care coordination program will be an important first step. Accompanying the Enrollee to physician office visits may also be an important first step in relationship development. 2. Hospitals Each of the two community Hospitals (Decatur Memorial Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital) will be provided with a log-in user name and password permitting access to the Mental Health Board's website and access to the Streamline Healthcare Solutions care coordination software. Both Hospitals' personn el, including Emergency Department staff, will also be offered training in system use, trouble-shooting options and system documentation entry and uploading. Hospital primary care pr oviders and treatment staff, as part of an Enrollee's care coordination team, will be provid ed electronic access to the care coordination application. Access to specific Enrollee's health information will be secured and accessible only according to access privileges provided by care coordination staff, based on the 129 Enrollee's written, signed and electronically post ed authorization for release of information to Hospital personnel. St. Mary's Hospital uses the Meditech Electr onic Medical Record system and has agreed to provide Care Coordination staff access to their patient record system. Care Coordination staff, upon starting work, w ill each make a request to the Hospit al for access to the Hospital's electronic record system, sign a confidentia lity agreement with the Hospital and then be assigned an access password and Meditech ac count for Care Coordination. St. Mary's Hospital will then provide instru ctions for accessing the gateway for entry into Meditech. This process is currently in use, providing the He ritage Behavioral Health Center's Hospital Liaison staff access to Meditech for patients hospitalized at St. Mary's who are registered clients of Heritage Behavioral Health Center. As part of enrollment in care coordination, the individual will be registered by care coordination staff in the St. Mary's Meditech EMR and associated with the care coordi nation program. This associati on will actuate notifications to care coordination staff of enrollee use of Hospit al services on a same day or next day basis. Care Coordination staff will have the ability to request notification vi a e-mail about care coordination enrollee use of Hospital services, including inpatient, Emergency Department, lab services, etc. Decatur Memorial Hospital uses Healthcare Business Infomatics (HBI) software and has also agreed to provide Care Coordination staff access to the Hospital's electronic record system for Care Coordination Enrollees. Access will be provided after the Care Coordination program signs a confidentiality agreement with the Hospital and is then assigned an access password and HBI account for Ca re Coordination. Decatur Me morial Hospital will then provide instructions for accessing the gateway fo r entry into HBI. As part of enrollment in care coordination, the individual will be pre-register ed in the HBI-EMR a nd associated with the care coordination program. This electronic association will ac tuate notifications to care coordination staff of Enrollee use of Hospital serv ices on a same day or next day basis, in a manner very similar to the notifications provided from St. Mary's Hospital. Care Coordination staff will have the ability to request notificati on via e-mail about care coordination enrollee use of Hospital services, including inpatien t, Emergency Department, lab services, etc. 3. Mental Health and Substance Abuse Provider Heritage Behavioral Health Center currently has the ability to inte rface electronically with the Care Coordination information exchange system via log-in through the Macon County Mental Health Board web-host site. This log-in procedure has been used by Heritage for the past two years in accessing the Mental Health Board's website and uploading information and documentation to the electronic vouchering pr ocess. Heritage has a login user name and password permitting access to the Board's website. 130 Heritage staff, as part of an individual's care coordination team, will be provided electronic access to the care coordination app lication via the Board's website. Access to information on specific an En rollee's health information will be secured and accessible only according to access privileges provided by Care Coordination sta ff, based on the Enrollee's written, signed and electronically posted authori zation for release of information to Heritage personnel. Access coding per Enrollee will be prov ided to Heritage service provider staff as the individual is enrolled and as release of information is authorized. 4. Macon County Health Department The Health Department staff, as indicated earlier, have computer and in ternet access and have the ability to access the care coordination softw are via the web-host at www.mcmhb.com , will have the ability to upload and do wnload clinical information, access shared care coordination health information for enrollees and participate in secure messaging. 3.2.4.2.2 Describe how you will address issues of privacy and confidentiality. The following is an outline of considerations Macon County Care Coordination will address concerning issues of privacy and confidentiality: System: User ID and password-based Authentication Function-level security groups that feature on\\off selection Program-level security which restricts user access based on organization, program, location etc. Encrypts data during authentication Change password dialog allows user to change password if needed more frequently than required Application requires user to change initial password when logging in for the first time Requires password change every to be determined interval Locks user out for specified period after a pre-determined number of unsuccessful login attempts. Provider restrictions by patient Audit trail: Log user log-on\\log off of system Providers assigned to a Security group for application access. Providers cannot change authorization data. 131 Process: Client release of information before setting up Authorizations System administrator role clearly defined in assignment of providers\\clinicians to clients. Define levels of access: o Individual Role o Care Coordinator Supervisor o Care Coordinator o Provider Organization o Provider Macon County Care Coordinat ion will comply with all HIPAA compliance obligations and provide procedures consistent wi th the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information at 45 CFR Part 160 and 45 CFR Part 164 subparts A and E, for protected health information (PHI), as defined in 45 CFR sectio n 164.501. Macon County Care Coordination will use or disclose PHI only for the following purposes: 1. to perform the functions, activities, or se rvices for, or on behalf of, the Department of Healthcare and Family Services (DHFS) as specified in a Care Coordination Contract between DHFS and Macon County Care Coordination. 2. to manage and administer or to carry out t he legal responsibilities of Macon County Care Coordination. 3. to disclose PHI for the management and administration of Macon County Care Coordination, provided that the disclosures are required by law, or Macon County Care Coordination obtains written assurances from the organization/person to whom the PHI is disclosed that the PHI will remain confidential and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purpose for which it was disclosed. 4. to use PHI to provide data aggregation services to the Department of Healthcare and Family Services, as permitted by 45 CFR section 164.504(e)(2)(i)(B). 5. to use PHI to report violations of la w to appropriate federal and state authorities, consistent with 45 CFR section 164.502(j)(1). In addition, Macon County Care Coordination will: 1. not use or further disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by the Contract between the Department of Healthcare and Fa mily Services and Macon County Care Coordination, or as required by law; 2. use and disclose an Individual's PHI by limiting disclosures as required by HIPAA. 132 3. refrain from exchanging any PHI with any entity of which Macon County Care Coordination knows of a pattern of activity or practice that constitutes a material breach or violation of HIPAA; 4. use safeguards of secure and password pr otected web-based access to PHI by care coordination staff and health service providers, in order to prevent use or disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by contract between DHFS and Macon County Care Coordination and by agreement between Macon County Care Coordination and network service providers; in additi on, Macon County Care Coordinat ion will provide for secure, locked storage of any paper records related to an individual's PHI; 5. mitigate, to the extent practi cable, any harmful effect that is known to Macon County Care Coordination of a use or disclosure of PHI by Macon County Care Coordination which is in violation of the requirements of the cont ract between DHFS and Macon County Care Coordination; 6. report to DHFS any use or disclosure of PH I not provided for by the contract of which Macon County Care Coordination becomes aware; 7. ensure that any health service providers, in cluding any sub-contractors, to whom Macon County Care Coordination provides PHI received from DHFS or created or received by Macon County Care Coordination on behalf of DHFS, agree to the same restrictions and conditions that apply through the contract between DHFS and Macon County Care Coordination with respect to such PHI; 8. provide access to a designated set of PHI to DHFS and work to incorporate any amendments to this designated set of PHI, at the request of DHFS; This access and incorporation of any prescribed amendments will be provided with the required 15 day period; 9. make Macon County Care Coordination's internal practices, books, and records, including policies and procedures and PHI, relating to the use and disclosure of PHI received from DHFS or created or receiv ed by Macon County Care Coordination on behalf of DHFS available to the DHFS and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for purposes of determining the DHFS' compliance with the Privacy Rule; 10. document disclosures of PHI and information related to disclosures of PHI as would be required for DHFS to respond to a request by an individual for an accounting of disclosures of PHI;PHI will be made available to DHFS within the required 10 day period; 11. provide to DHFS, upon request, information co llected as a part of the contract between DHFS and Macon County Care Coordination, to pe rmit the DHFS to respond to a request by an individual for an accounting of disclosures of PHI. This information will be made available to DHFS within the required 15 day period; and, 133 12. return or destroy all PHI received from DHFS or created or re ceived by Macon County Care Coordination on behalf of DHFS t hat Macon County Care Coordination still maintains in any form, and to retain no copies of the PHI, upon termination of the contract between DHFS and Macon County Care Coordination, for any reason. In the event that Macon County Care Coordination discovers a br each of unsecured PHI, Macon County Care Coordination take the following measures within 10 calendar days after first becoming aware of the incident: 1. notify the DHFS of any incide nt involving the acquisition, access, use or disclosure of unsecured PHI in a manner not permitted under 45 C.F.R. part E. This notice will be provided even if Macon County Care Coordinat ion has not conclusively determined within that time that the incident constitutes a Breach as defi ned by HIPAA, unles s instructed otherwise by law enforcement; 2. include the names of the Individuals w hose unsecured PHI has been the subject of a Breach; 3. complete and submit a Breach Notice form to DHFS; 4. provide the Breach notificati on to the affected individuals; 5. assume all costs for providing Breach notif ication, unless DHFS agrees to assume any costs; and, 6. indemnify DHFS for costs as sociated with any incident involving the acquisition, access, use or disclosure of unsecured PHI in a m anner not permitted under 45 C.F.R. part E. Consistent with P.A. 0 97-0515, recently signed legislation designed to enhance the ability of providers to integrate mental, developmental disability and physical healthcare services for consumers covered by Medicaid, SCHIP and other programs, each potential enrollee will be asked to authorize release of healthcare information to each involved healthcare providers. Enrollees will be asked, as part of initial enro llment processes, to sign a release of information forms permitting disclosure of medical and/or behavioral health information from each provider to Macon County Care Coordination and to Network providers involved in their care. Failure to authorize release of information may prohibit enrollment. It is understood that the Department of Healthcare and family Services is currently working on a standardized release of information format that addresses the change in law identified in P.A. 097-0515 and that this format may be availabl e for use by care coordination entities. In addition, all Enrollee health information will be stored securely and accessible only with authorization specific to each provider and to each Enrollee for whom consent for release of information has been secu red. Care Coordination staff will as sume responsibility for maintaining current access permissions for pr oviders. Only Care Coordination staff w ill have access to all Enrollee data, as authorized by the individual En rollee upon consent for involvement in the care coordination program. 134 All service providers will be asked and required to complete the Business Associate Agreement (see Attachment G, Business Asso ciate Agreement), prior to being granted permission to access the electronic informatio n exchange system used by Macon County Care Coordination. DHF will be notified of any i dentified breach in information security. 3.2.4.3 Describe any resources you plan to provide to collaborators in the area of HIT. Macon County Care Coordination has joined with a consortium of two other care coordination entities and has contracted with Streamline Heal thcare Solutions for the adaptation of a care coordination software package that will permit the exchange of and storage of health information for Enrollees in care coordination. Macon County Ca re Coordination has elected to use a privately developed software package to permit secure messag ing and information exchange rather than using the ILHIE (Illinois Office of Health Informatio n Technology) Direct Secure Messaging. Based on individual provider requirements, Care Coordinati on staff will have access to ILHIE and may use this communication vehicle for communication with servic e providers while all parties become acquainted with the use of Streamline Healthcare Solutions system. The Streamline Healthcare Solutions adaptation will be accessible to all providers of service with internet access and proper authorization. The so ftware will permit uploading of data and information from each provider. Initially, it is anticipated that care coordinat ors will assume pr imary responsibility for ensuring that all important health information is incorporated in the information exchange system for use by service provider part ners. Streamline Healthcare Soluti ons consultants will provide the following: Project management in integrating the various collaborators into the systems and addressing the impact of change to the collaborators. Training of collaborators' personnel in use of the aforementioned sy stems, offered where applicable. On-going 'help desk' to address issues with use of the systems. 3.3.1 Financial Model 3.3.1 CCE Reimbursement 3.3.1.1 Which of the three reimbursement options is the CCE selecting? Note: CCEs may select more than one option (See Section 3.1.6.1.1). Care Coordination Fee: an administrative Per Member Per Month (PMPM) fee for each population type in its care coordination model. See Section 3.1.4.3.1 Pay-for-Performance and Section 3.4 Payment Terms and Conditions for more details. 135 Shared Savings: A CCE will be eligible to receive shared savings payments. Shared savings calculations will compare the pr ojected cost of care with ca re coordination to baselines developed by the State and Federal CMS. The CC E will be eligible for up to 50 percent of savings annually (the remaining savings will go to federal and State governments) and will propose how its shared savings will be distributed among its collaborators. See Section 3.1.4.3.1 Pay-for-Performance and Section 3. 4 Payment Terms and Conditions for more details. Interagency Payment Flexibility Proposal: A CCE may choose and is encouraged to develop new, innovative payment methodologies as long as the model facilitates care coordination among a diverse set of Providers and incentiviz es more efficient practice. These models may include combining payment streams from mu ltiple State agencies and new methods for paying for currently reimbursed services such as bundled payments and payments for episodes of care. A CCE may also propose regulatory flexibility to enable better coordination of care. Macon County Care coordination has selected two reimbursement options, as follows: Care Coordination Fee: A three-tiered fee schedule, based on t he level of care coordination service required by the Enrollee. The fee schedule shall be used for both target populations: individuals with serious ment al illness and seniors with chronic health conditions. The three tiers of care coordination offered include: Intensive Intensive care coordination serves the indivi dual at high risk for poor health outcomes. The objective for this level of care coordination is support for recovery and a sustained decrease in avoidable service utilization and problematic symptoms, along with sustained progress toward an improved quality of life and a reduction or moderation of risk factors. This level of service includes frequent and multiple contacts with the Enrollee and the Enrollee's medical home, service providers, family and significant others. It may also include resource-finding and problem solving around obstacles in access to care or needed services and supports. It also may include active direct involvement with the Enrollee to support participation in healthcare services. Supportive Supportive care coordination services the individual at moderate risk for poor health outcomes. The objective for this level of care is the development of re siliency, in which the Enrollee begins to assume responsibility for ill ness management, taking steps to reduce the risk of future service utilization, decrease risk factors and increase those activities that protect the Enrollee's health. Services at this level of care coordination include special attention to the Enrollee's transition from one service setting to another, active engagement with the Enrollee's service providers to monitor the En rollee's continuing involvement in treatment services, anticipating Enrollee challenges and helpi ng to construct planning that will assist the Enrollee in overcoming these challenges. This level of care coordination also includes regular personal contact with the Enrollee. Preventative 136 Preventive care coordination serves the indivi dual at low risk for poor health outcomes: Services at this level of care coordination in clude health educat ion and illness self- management training for the Enrollee, referral to health and wellness activities and monitoring of the Enrollee's functioning. Shared Savings Any and all shared savings received by Macon Coun ty Care Coordination will be reinvested in the purchase of services for the two proposed target populations, seriously mental ill individuals and seniors with chronic illness. The Macon County Mental Health Boar d, as the Lead Entity for the care coordination proposal, has extensive experience in purchase of service contracting and uses the DHFS Medicaid reimbursement rate as the paym ent rate in contracting for services that are comparable to Illinois mental health and substa nce abuse Medicaid services. Shared savings amounts will be incorporated into the Mental Health Board's contracting procedures. Local network providers will be approach ed will be invited to contract with t he Mental Health Board for services supported through shared savings . Specific services to be c ontracted will be identified by consensus of the core collaborator s about identified service gaps in the local system and identified providers. 3.3.1.2 If proposing a Care Coordination Fee, propose an administrative PMPM by population type for each of the first three years of the Contract, fo llowing the template provided in Attachment F. Please see Attachment F. 3.3.1.3 If proposing another interagency payment flexibility methodology, describe the proposed payment structure including amounts and how often the CCE would be paid. Macon County Care Coordination is not proposing an interagency payment flexibility methodology. 3.3.1.4 With respect to Department data, indicate the population definition number(s) and version number that you relied upon for preparing this Proposal. Population # 18. No version number was noted. 3.3.1.5 Describe any data (other than data received fr om the Department) that you relied upon. Macon County Care Coordination used the combined observations of the core collaborator leadership in appraising community service need and, in addition, compared finding from DHFS data analysis with another collaborating group that one of the core collaborators, Heritage Behavioral Health Center, has been working with on a separate Ca re Coordination Entity proposal. 3.3.1.6 Describe in detail how you expect your care coor dination model to result in cost neutrality - to reduce costs by at least as much as the care coordination fees you expect to receive over three years. 137 Medicaid cost savings are achievable only by co ncentrating care coordination services on high- risk, high cost seriously mentally ill individuals. As identified earlier in this proposal, SMI individuals in Macon Count y comprise 11% of all Medicaid servic e recipients in the County, however, total cost for treatment of SMI individuals ($18,573,657) amou nts to over 24% of total Medicaid spending ($81,355,014) for all County Medicaid recipients rece iving services. Cost per individual with SMI is $12,006 per year, over two and one-half times as high as the cost for those individuals without serious mental illness ($4,715)). Ho spital inpatient days for SMI individuals total 3974 or 37% of all inpatient days. Emergency Department visits for SMI individuals total 1921, or 23% of total ER visits. SMI individuals are using inpatient and Emergency Depar tment services at a rate over two times as frequently as those Macon County residents without SMI. The top quartile of Medicaid spending for individuals with serious mental illness, total Medicaid spending is $13,388,004.70, or 72% of total Medica id spending for individuals with serious mental illness. Average Medicaid cost for this set of indi viduals is $34,865 per year. Of the total cost for treatment of individuals with serious mental illness, $5,378,296 is spent for congregate care and is not included as part of potential cost savings. The focus for cost savings involving individuals wi th serious mental illness is on inpatient medical and psychiatric treatment and emergency department service utilization. Seriously mentally ill individuals accumulated 912 hospitalizations in 20 10, 5042 patient days of ca re, an average length of stay of 5.5 days and hospitaliz ation rate of 554 per 1000 recipients, over three times the hospitalization rate for non-seriously mentally ill indi viduals. Total cost for inpatient care for seriously mentally ill individuals was $3,438,674, including $2 ,812,333 for inpatient medical care and $626,341 for inpatient behavioral health care. Emergency departm ent visits by seriously mentally ill individuals totaled 4,792 visits, 69% of total emergency department visits by all Macon County Medicaid recipients and a utilization rate of 2914 visits per 1000 recipients. Total cost for emergency department services in 2010 was $489,609. The po ol of expense from which potential savings is projected, the combined total of inpatient and Emergency Department expenses, is $3,928,283. As cited previously, of the 1547 SMI individual s in Macon County, 865 received mental health Medicaid services through the Medicaid mental health services program while an additional 682 SMI individuals did not. Recognizing that many with serious mental illness st ruggle both physically and mentally and are sometimes difficult to engage in treatment, the care coordination program will prioritize outreach to those difficult to engage, those with serious mental illness and co-morbid medical conditions and those individuals with patterns of high inpatient and emergency department services. Projected savings from care coordination programming is as follows: 138 Year Potential Savings Pool (Inpatient and E.D. Expense) Enrollment penetration rate (N = 1547) Projected Savings Rate Projected Savings Per Year after Care Coordination Expense 1 $3,928,283 Total Savings $538,726 3.3.1.7 How do we plan to distribute the payment(s) among collaborators? Per member per month reimbursement will be used exclusively to su pport care coordination services. The core collaborators have not requested nor do they anticipate payment for service provided, other than fee-for-service payments for Medicaid-covered se rvices, as services are provided to Medicaid- eligible individuals. As described earlier in this proposal, any shared savings that would accrue to Macon County Care Coordination would be re-invested in services for the target populations through purchase of service contracting from the Lead Enti ty, the Macon County Mental Health Board by service providers in the community. Service needs and services to be purchased through this shared savings amount will be determined based on ident ified need, as recommended by the core collaborators involved in this proposal and as appr oved by the Macon County Mental Health Board of Directors. 3.3.1.8 What percentage of payment(s), if any, do we plan to put into a reserve pool? Five percent. 3.3.1.9 Please list all case management fees collaborators receive other than IHC fees, such as case management fees paid in HCBS Waivers. The St ate will not pay twice for the same care coordination services. Macon County Health Department and St. Mary's Hospital are currently providing HCBS waiver services for the elderly, supported by the Department of Aging. 3.3.1.10 Do we plan to request an advance on the care co ordination fee to assist in the development of the CCE infrastructure prior to implementation? 3.3.1.10.1 What percentage or amount are we requesting? 3.3.1.10.2 Describe the intended use of the fee advance. 3.3.1.10.3 Propose a repayment schedule. Macon County Care Coordination is requesting an advance of $309,379, which is the difference between first year operating costs for the prog ram, $673,869, and projected first year PMPM payments, $364,490. This advance will be us ed to support first year operations. 139 Repayment is proposed as follows: Year Repayment Amount Monthly Repayment Amount 1 2 $ 203,069 $ 16,922 3 $ "}
