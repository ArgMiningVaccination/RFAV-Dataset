While this Policy does not require referrals t o visit specialists, if you need specialty care you are encouraged to wo rk with your PCP, who can coordinate your care and assist you in selecting a specialist appropriate for your care .

Under certain medical circumst ances, We may continue to reimburse Covered Expenses from your PC P or a specialist you've been seeing at the Partici pating Provider benefit level even though he or she is no longer affiliated with Cigna's network.

In addition, no benefits are payable unless the Ins ured Person receives services from a Participating Provider, except as indicated below under \"Special Circumstances\". Participating Hospitals, Participating Physicians a nd Other Participating Providers Covered Expenses for Participating Providers are ba sed on Our Negotiated Rate. Participating Providers have agreed NOT to charge more than the Cigna Negotiated Rates for Covered Services. Participating Providers may cha rge the Insured Person for services that are not Covered Se rvices under the Policy.

COINDEPO052020 Cigna Connect Flex Gold 2000 MIEP0746 55 Surprise Billing You are responsible for applicable In-Network cost- sharing amounts, including Copayments, Deductibles and/or Coinsurance. If you receive services from a Non-Par ticipating Provider or use services in a Non-Partic ipating Hospital or other type of Non-Participating facilit y, you may have to pay additional costs associated with that care. Non-Participating Hospitals, facilities or Provider s often bill you the difference between what Cigna decides is the eligible charge and what the Non-Participating Prov ider bills as the total charge. This is called 'sur prise' or 'balance' billing. When you CANNOT be balance-billed: Emergency Services When you receive services for emergency medical car e, usually the most you can be billed for Emergency Services is your plan's In-Network cost-sharing amounts, whi ch are Copayments, Deductibles and/or Coinsurance. You cannot be balanced-billed for any other amount. Thi s includes both the emergency facility and any Prov iders you may see for emergency care. Non-Emergency Services at a Participating or Non-Pa rticipating Facility The Hospital or facility must tell you if you are a t a Non-Participating location or at a Participatin g location that is using Non-Participating Providers. It must also tel l you what types of services may be provided by any Non- Participating Provider. You have the right to request that Participating Providers perform all covered medical services. However, you may have to receive medical services from a Non-Partici pating Provider if a Participating Provider is not available. When this happens, the most you can be billed for Covered Services is your In-Network cost-sharing amount (Copayments, Deductibles and/or Coinsurance). These providers cannot balance bill you. If you receive services from a Non-Participating Pr ovider, Hospital or facility in any OTHER situation , you may still be balance billed, or you may be responsi ble for the entire bill. If you intentionally recei ve non- Emergency Services from a Non-Participating Provide r or facility, you may also be balance billed. If you do receive a bill for amounts other than you r Copayments, Deductible and/or Coinsurance, please contact us at the number on your ID card. General Provisions When the amount paid by Cigna exceeds the amount f or which We are liable under this Policy, We have t he right to recover the excess amount from the Insured Person unless prohibited by law. In order for an Insured Person to be entitled to b enefits under this Policy, coverage under this Poli cy must be in effect on the date the expense giving rise to a cla im for benefits is incurred. Under this Policy, an expense is incurred on the date the Insured Person(s) receives a service or supply for which the charge is made. We will pay all benefits of this Policy directly t o Participating Hospitals, Participating Physicians , and all other Participating Providers, whether the Insured Person has authorized assignment of benefits or not, unle ss the Insured Person has paid the claim in full, in which case We will reimburse the Insured Person. In add ition, We may pay any covered Provider of services directly w hen the Insured Person assigns benefits in writing no later than the time of filing proof of loss (claim), exce pt for Foreign Country Provider claims. However, W e may, at Our option, make payment to You for the cost of any Covered Expenses from a Non-Participating Provider even if benefits have been assigned. When benefits are paid to You or Your Family Members, You or Your Family Members are responsible for reimbursing the Provider and Our payment to You will be considered fulfillment of Our obligation.

You pay half the 30-day Cost-Share for this initial 15 day supply, and would be responsible for the other half of the 30-day Cost Share if an additional 15 day s upply is provided. The therapeutic classes of Prescription Drugs that are included in this program are determi ned by Cigna and will be managed for continuation in this progra m as new clinical guidelines and dispensing experie nce dictates.

Your Policy's coverage tiers may contain Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies that are Generic Drugs, Brand Name Drugs or Specialty Medications. P lacement of any Prescription Drug or Related Suppli es in a specific tier, and application of utilization manag ement requirements to a Prescription Drug, depends on a number of clinical and economic factors. Clinical factors in clude, without limitation, the P&T Committee's eval uations of the place in therapy, or relative safety or relative ef ficacy of the Prescription Drug or Related Supplies , and economic factors include, without limitation, the cost and/o r available rebates for Prescription Drugs or Relat ed Supplies. Whether a particular Prescription Drug or Related S upplies is appropriate for You or any of Your Famil y Member(s), regardless of its eligibility coverage under Your P olicy, is a determination that is made by You (or Y our Family Member) and the prescribing Physician. The coverage status of a Prescription Drug or Relat ed Supply may change periodically during the Year f or various reasons. For example, a Prescription Drug or Relate d Supply may be removed from the market, a new Pres cription Drug in the same therapeutic class may become avail able, or the cost of a Prescription Drug or Related Supply may increase. As a result of coverage changes, you may be require d to pay more or less for that Prescription Drug or Related Supply, or try another covered Prescription Drug or Related Supply.

Recovery may be by settlement, judgm ent or otherwise. The lien will be in the amount of benefits paid by Us under this Policy for the treatment of the Illne ss, disease, Injury or condition for which the third party is liable. We will be entitled to collect on our lien even if the amount recovered by or for the Insured Person (or his or her estate, paren t or legal guardian) from or for the account of suc h third party as compensation for the Injury, Illness or condition i s less than the actual loss suffered by the Insured Person.

Governmental benefits as permitted by law, except for Medicaid, Medicare and Medicare supplement poli cies. Medical benefits coverage under any form of group or individual automobile insurance. Each plan or part of a plan which has the right to coordinate benefits will be considered a separate p lan. Primary Plan The plan that pays first as determined by the Order of Benefit Determination Rules below. Secondary Plan The plan that pays after the Primary Plan as determ ined by the Order of Benefit Determination Rules be low. The benefits under the Secondary Plan are reduced based on the benefits under the Primary Plan. Allowable Expense The portion of a Covered Expense used in determinin g the benefits this plan pays when it is the Second ary Plan. The Allowable Expense is the lesser of: the charge used by the Primary Plan in determining the benefits it pays; the charge that would be used by this plan in dete rmining the benefits it would pay if it were the Pr imary Plan, and the amount of the Covered Expense. If the benefits for a Covered Expense under Your Pr imary Plan are reduced because You did not comply w ith the Primary Plan's requirements (for example, getting p re-certification of Hospital admission or a second surgical opinion), the amount of the Allowable Expense is reduced by t he amount of the reduction. Claim Determination Period A Calendar Year, but does not include any part of a year during which you are not covered under this p lan or any date before this section or any similar provision takes effect. Order of Benefit Determination Rules A plan that does not have a coordination of benefit s rule consistent with this section shall always be the Primary Plan. If the plan does have a coordination of benefits rule consistent with this section, the first of the foll owing rules that applies to the situation is the one that applies: The plan that covers you as an enrollee or an empl oyee shall be the Primary Plan and the plan that co vers you as a dependent shall be the Secondary Plan; If you are a dependent child whose parents are not divorced or legally separated, the Primary Plan sh all be the plan which covers the parent whose birthday falls f irst in the Calendar Year as an enrollee or employe e; If you are the dependent of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the dependent shall be determ ined in the following order: o first, if a court decree states that one parent is responsible for the child's healthcare expenses or health coverage and the plan for that parent has actual kn owledge of the terms of the order, but only from th e time of actual knowledge; COINDEPO052020 Cigna Connect Flex Gold 2000 MIEP0746 65 o then, the plan of the parent with custody of the c hild; o then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with cu stody of the child; o then, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child, and o finally, the plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child. The plan that covers you as an active employee (or as that employee's dependent) shall be the Primary Plan and the plan that covers you as a laid-off or retired e mployee (or as that employee's dependent) shall be the Secondary Plan. If the other plan does not have a s imilar provision and, as a result, the plans cannot agree on the order of benefit determination, this paragraph shal l not apply. The plan that covers you under a right of continua tion which is provided by federal or state law shal l be the Secondary Plan and the plan that covers you as an a ctive employee or retiree (or as that employee's de pendent) shall be the Primary Plan. If the other plan does n ot have a similar provision and, as a result, the p lans cannot agree on the order of benefit determination, this p aragraph shall not apply. If one of the plans that covers you is issued out of the state whose laws govern this plan, and deter mines the order of benefits based upon the gender of a parent, and as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefit determination, the plan with the gender rules shall determine the order of benefits. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the plan that has covered you for the lon ger period of time shall be primary. Effect on the Benefits Payable If this plan is the Primary Plan, the amount this plan pays for a Covered Expense will be determined without regard for the benefits payable under any other plan. If this plan is the Secondary Plan, the amount thi s plan pays for a Covered Expense is the Allowable Expense less the amount paid by the Primary Plan during a Claim Determination Period. If while covered under this Policy, you are also co vered by another Cigna individual or group plan, yo u will be entitled to the benefits of only one plan. You may choose this Policy or the plan under which you will be covered. Cigna will then refund any Premium received under the other plan co vering the time period both policies were in effect . However, any claim payments made by Cigna under the plan you ele cted to cancel will be deducted from any such refun d of Premium. Recovery of Excess Benefits If this Policy is the Secondary Plan and Cigna pays for Covered Expenses that should have been paid by the Primary Plan, or if Cigna pays any amount in excess of what it is obligated to pay, Cigna will have the right to recover the actual overpayment made. Cigna will have sole discretion t o seek such recovery from any person to, or for who m, or with respect to whom, such services were provided or suc h payments made by any insurance company, healthcar e plan or other organization. If We request, You must execute and deliver to Us such instruments and documents a s We determine are necessary to secure the right of reco very.
