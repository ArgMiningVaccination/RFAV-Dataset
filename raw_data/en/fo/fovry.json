These allergens are present in our environment but do not usually incite an immune response in other people. While in some people, the body's immune system generates antibodies against these foreign bodies or allergens. This causes inflammation and leads to various symptoms that can range from being mild to quite severe. The symptoms of allergy vary such as mild sneezing, runny nose, swelling of face, swelling of the tongue, skin rash, itching, and difficulty in breathing, etc. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction to any type of allergy which can be life-threatening, if not promptly treated. Allergies are widely prevalent across the world. These can be caused due to different types of allergens such as dust, molds, mites, foods like nuts, fish, and medicines like penicillin. Clinical treatment for allergies is suggested with antihistamine medicines, steroids, and OTC preparations to provide relief from symptoms. "}
