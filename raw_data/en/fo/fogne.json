The study provides a comprehensive and consistent source of information on the global burden of diseases, injuries and risk factors . A collaborative project of researchers worldwide, the study was led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington . The next phase of the study is under way . The GBD indicates that global health burdens have shifted markedly . Early mortality caused by factors such as infectious diseases and infant and child mortality has evolved into longer lives with greater incidence of chronic disease and associated health burdens from diet, lack of exercise, high blood pressure and other contemporary factors . These patterns are found both in developed and developing nations . One of the study's many striking findings is the increasingly dominant role that musculoskeletal diseases play in health worldwide . The study affirms that musculoskeletal disease, such as low back pain and neck pain, is the second greatest cause of disability globally . This finding intersects with other advances discussed in this issue . UW Medicine recently opened a Sports Medicine Center at the newly renovated Husky Stadium . This high-tech center \u2014 not just for athletes but also for all who suffer from chronic and acute musculoskeletal issues \u2014 offers an integrated approach to care, including orthopedic surgery, rehabilitation medicine, family medicine, sports medicine, radiology, sports performance and physical therapy . Please visit this new facility that augments services offered at other UW Medicine locations . A generous gift from SonoSite (see page 22) to engage a musculoskeletal sonographer for orthopedic and other ultrasound work will have a tremendous impact on the Sports Medicine Center and many parts of UW Medicine . Other articles in this issue describe major new activities made possible by generous donors \u2014 from the Center for the Intestinal Microbiome for those who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases, to a professorship for breast cancer research, to new scholarship resources for our medical students . Thank you for your support of UW Medicine at this time of remarkable advances in medicine . Without our supporters \u2014 alumni, donors, faculty, staff, trainees and interested individuals \u2014 we would not be able to make the profound progress that occurs at UW Medicine on a daily basis .

The principal investigator is Michael Katze, Ph .D ., UW professor in the Department of Microbiology and a pio- neer in using systems biology to under - stand immune responses to infections . Katze says, \"The AIDS vaccine field is in need of new approaches . The methods we use allow us to understand the gene expression changes that correlate with vaccine efficacy and will help to design better vaccines .\" The researchers also will look for markers of protection, such as blood antibody levels that can be tested to show a vaccine has taken and confers immunity . Gene for most common childhood cancer identified In a study by UW Medicine researchers and others, an aberrant gene has been found to cause the most common childhood cancer in the world, pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or All . The gene, PAX5, has long been known to be involved in All . The new study indicates that a mutation in the gene alone is sufficient to eventu-ally cause the disease . All affects nearly 3,000 children and teenagers in the United States each year . \"The discovery should make it possible to screen for the gene in families with a history of the disease and suggests new strategies for treating the disease,\" said Marshall Horwitz, Ph .D . '88, M .D . '90, res . '92, of pathology and medicine at UW Medicine . Horwitz is a co-author of the new study, published Sept . 8 in the journal Nature Genetics, which also involved other UW collaborators, St . Jude Children's research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn ., and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New y ork City . a genomic portrait of Hela, the breakthrough cell line UW Medicine researchers have unveiled a comprehensive portrait of the genome of Hela, the world's first immortal cell line . Prior to 1951, scientists had long tried to reproduce cells in a culture, but the cells always died . In contrast, the Hela cells, taken from Henrietta lacks in 1951, reproduced at the rate of an entire generation every 24 hours and never stopped . Hela cells made possible major medical breakthroughs: the polio vac-cine, cloning and the development of drugs for treating major illnesses such as herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia and Parkinson's disease . The cell line was derived from an aggressive cervical cancer that killed lacks, a 31-year-old African-American tobacco farmer and mother of five, and the subject of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. The researchers' study, which may explain the aggressiveness of lacks' cancer and the staying power of the Hela cell line, was published in the Aug . 8 issue of Nature. Jay Shendure, M .D ., Ph .D ., a UW associ- ate professor of genome sciences, was the senior author . patient care High rankings for all of UW Medicine's hospitals U.S. News & World Report again ranked UW Medical Center the best hospital in the Seattle metropolitan area (as well as the top hospital in Washington) in its recently published annual report on the nation's best hospitals .

This snapshot of the world in 2010, released in 2013, shows the toll taken by communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional disorders by country. What's being measured? The DALY (or disability-adjusted life year), a time-based measurement that combines years of life lost due to premature mortality and years lived in less than ideal health. The countries on the left (blue) end of the spectrum have the fewest DALYs per 100,000. Read more, next page. Fall 2013 7THE GBD: PoWEr In CollaBora TIon In undertaking the GBD, IHME enlisted a large group of collabo- rators and amassed an enormous amount of data to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries and risk factors by age, sex and geography over time. Collaborators: 488 researchers, 303 institutions, 50 countriesCountries examined: 187 Epidemiological 21 factors evaluated: 67age groups assessed: 20 accomplishments Set the stage for policy decisions worldwide related to healthcare and resource allocation. Developed metrics that quantify disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a time-based measure that combines years lived with a disability and years of life lost due to premature mortality. Strengthened statistical methods used for estimation. Created a system capable of integrating new data sources. Published data from 2010 (and 1990 and 2005).

Global Burden of Disease > Health trends in global populations are in constant flux. This may be the most basic lesson drawn from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2010, an in-depth and unprec-edentedly thorough look at the way people around the world live and die. led by the institute for Health Metrics and evaluation (iHMe) at the University of Washington and involving collaborating institutions and researchers worldwide, the GBd offers a plethora of relatable and highly detailed data on everything from cervical cancer, heart disease and childhood obesity to tuberculosis, automobile fatalities and gun violence. This wealth of information, organized and presented as a free and searchable online tool, reveals significant and surprising changes in global health trends since 1990. Take, for instance, positive change shown by the data on the global stage. Great strides have been made in mini-mizing fatal illnesses, especially deadly infectious diseases, for people of all ages. as infectious diseases and child illnesses related to malnutrition lose their hold, child mortality is trending downward in many parts of the world.However, while people are living longer, many live with more chronic pain, limited mobility, and impair - ment in hearing, sight and cognitive function. chronic disabilities, such as mental and behavioral disorders, mus-culoskeletal problems and neurological conditions, now account for nearly half of all health loss in the U.S. The purpose of gathering all this data? \"We need objective evidence to show policymakers what works and what does not work in order to im-prove people's lives,\" says christopher J. l. Murray, M.d., d. Phil., iHMe's director and UW professor in the department of Global Health. an ambitious and independent agenda an independent global health research center and part of the University of Washington, iHMe's mission is to provide rigorous and comparable measurement of the world's most pressing health issues and evaluate the strategies used to address them. iHMe was founded in 2007 through a generous gift to the University of Washington from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Disability-adjusted life Years in Three Countries Each chart at right shows a snapshot of human health in 2010 (both sexes, all ages): one each for the U.S., Kenya and Guatemala. The orange-red boxes indicate the prevalence of communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional disorders. Blue boxes show non-communicable diseases, everything from cancer, to mental illness, to heart disease. Green boxes display injury, including violence and self-harm. A deep, vivid color indicates that the condition was on the rise between 2005 and 2010. With just a cursory look, you can see that non-communicable diseases were a larger health issue in the U.S. in 2010; the reverse was true of Kenya. In Guatemala, the two were more evenly divided. Dalys in the U NiteD State S, 2010 8 UW Medicine< Global Burden of Disease Murray notes that the founda- tion and the university have been instrumental to iHMe's and the GBd's success. \"Their support has allowed us to set an ambitious agenda to pro-vide comprehensive information on population health,\" he says. \"Having support from organizations that value research, science and measurement has helped us to ensure that our work in Seattle is recognized globally.\" The gift \u2014 and the collaboration with researchers worldwide on the GBd \u2014 also have given iHMe the freedom to serve as a trusted resource for policymakers, health organizations and others. \"By harnessing all sources of avail- able data, we're not dependent on any single measurement or any single source, and we remain independent from official intergovernmental agen-cies,\" says Murray. Using the GBD: from china to King county, Wash. First unveiled at the Royal Society in london in december 2012, and published shortly thereafter in a first-ever triple issue of The Lancet, the GBd's seven scientific papers and accompanying commentaries and tables provide a powerful new platform for assessing the world's biggest health challenges and finding the best ways to address them. The world has been taking notice \u2014 in part because the informa-tion, presented in an accessible format in online visualizations, is free and available to everyone: researchers, policymakers, the public. Paul G. Ramsey, M.d., ceO of UW Medicine and dean of the UW School of Medicine, is not surprised by the activity generated by the GBd. \"at a time when world economies are struggling, health systems and global health funders must know where best to allocate resources,\" he says. \"i see the GBd as a management tool for ministers of health and leaders of health systems to prepare for the specific health challenges coming their way.\" Murray says it's been gratifying to see how the GBd is being used throughout the world. \"Several countries, including australia, the U.K. and china, have worked with us to undertake studies focused on local health challenges using the GBd model,\" Murray says. \"The World Bank has been very sup-portive of our GBd analysis, and we've worked with them to create a series of reports on health issues in a group of World Bank regions.\" The GBd also is being used sig- nificantly closer to home, according to david Fleming, M.d., director and health officer for Public Health-Seattle & King county. The agency uses GBd data to compare how communities in King county fare against those in developed and developing countries. in addition to nutritional and physical activity programs, Fleming and his staff have an array of other healthcare issues to consider, includ-ing prenatal care and child healthcare, immunizations, diabetes screenings, HiV/aidS epidemiology and breast, cervical and colon cancer prevention. iHMe research data have been eye-opening resources. Dalys in K eNya, 2010 Dalys in G UateMala, 2010 Fall 2013 9Annual % change 2005 to 2010 DALYs/100,000\"if we examine King county at the census-tract level and ask how each census tract is doing relative to the best-performing countries \u2014 it turns out that the county's overall 'good' average hides huge underlying disparities,\" Fleming explains. Fleming, former director of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Global Health Strategies Program, says his staff is working with iHMe to replicate the GBd's work \u2014 especially the data visualizations \u2014 at the county level. \"By creating the visualizations, we will have a powerful tool that can help people better understand the nature of health disparities here in King county,\" says Fleming. and when leaders understand health disparities more fully, they have the resources to make better decisions about healthcare funding. Global health: now in our hands Results from the 2010 GBd are very much in the public eye, garnering attention and calls for action. and research to compile the GBd 2013 is already under way \u2014 the product of an advanced computing platform the iHMe created dur - ing their work on the 2010 report. The platform is designed to accommodate frequent updates and expansions. and expand it will. iHMe is reaching out to experts who are advancing the field of health metrics in countries around the world \u2014 the goal being not just to increase the number of collaborators and countries included in the GBd, but also to expand the list of diseases, injuries and risk factors included in the study. GBd 2013 is due out in 2014. \"The GBd platform and these powerful visual tools allow us to ask questions about the state of the world's health that we didn't even know to ask before,\" says Murray. \"They also allow us to engage everyone \u2014 from the highest levels of government to people on the street with their smart phones \u2014 in seeking understanding on how to improve people's health.\" \"Health measurement is no longer controlled by the specialists,\" Murray says. \"it is now in your hands.\" for more \u00bb Visit healthmetricsandevaluation.org Video: First lady Michelle Obama and Dr . Murray, Let's Move celebration Manipulable data visualizations (like those on page 9) The GBD in the news CHrIsToPHEr MUrra Y GoEs To WasHInGTon, D.C. According to GBD statistics, diet was the top risk factor for health loss in the U.S. in 2010. It may not be surpris-ing, then, to learn that First Lady Michelle Obama invited IHME's director, Christopher J. L. Murray, M.D., D. Phil., to speak at a gathering of community leaders in July that celebrated the anniversary of Let's Move! Cities, Towns and Counties. Let's Move is an initiative to end childhood obesity. \"First Lady Michelle Obama and the team working on the Let's Move campaign have been enthusiastic about using the Global Burden of Disease to explore trends related to physical activity and obesity at the county level, and the critical role that diet plays in good health,\" Murray says. The First Lady cited IHME research during her address to the group. Dietary risks contributed to more health loss in 2010 than smoking, high blood pressure and high blood sugar. \"Poor nutrition is the single greatest cause of preventable diseases and ailments in this country,\" Obama said. And while emphasizing the importance of communities' advocacy for healthier eating and increased physical activity, she pointed out how data from the GBD could be used to change public policy. \"The key here is that the data from this report goes all the way down to the county level, which means that you'll be able to see which issues are affecting your communities the most,\" she said. \"And once you have all this infor - mation, you'll be able to make more effective decisions to really focus your resources and programming to find solutions that fit the needs of your community.\" Following the First Lady's remarks, Murray presented GBD results on U.S. life expectancy, obesity and physical activity from three papers published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and Population Health Metrics. For further reading. The IHME offers numerous policy recommendations in The State of US Health: Innovations, Insights and Recommendations from the Global Burden of Disease Study, available on the IHME website. Among the recommendations that focus on diet: maximize the ability of primary-care providers to help patients modify behaviors with regard to food, alcohol and high blood pressure; use taxes and subsidies to incentivize diets that focus on food such as vegetables, seafood and whole grains; and create environments, both physical and social, that reward physical activity.

She leads the 62-year-old author through an evaluation that tests strength, mobility, biomechanics and more. at the end of the session, she renders the verdict. All photos: Clare McLeanBy Delia Ward 12 UW Medicine for the athlete in everyone > \"We're going to want to see you once or twice a week,\" Wallerich tells Bartley. Other recommenda-tions: stretch. Work on spinal stability exercises. consider purchasing a desk where you can stand and work. Bartley, still managing the after-effects of a car accident in 2008, takes it all in. There's a lot at stake for someone who loves to participate in sports as much as she does. Still, today is just a tune-up, a resumption of physical therapy after travel abroad on a Fulbright scholar - ship. Bartley clearly remembers the period \u2014 just after the accident \u2014 that left her with severe pain in her back and leg. \"at the time,\" says Bartley, \"it seemed like the end of the world.\" the athlete in everyone active people like Bartley can experience many physical setbacks: from traumatic injury, to injuries sustained during sports, to the gradual wearing down of the body. Whatever the condition, says Stanley a. Herring, M.d., Res. '82, medical director of UW Medicine Sports, Spine and Orthopedic Health, UW Medicine's Sports Medicine center is equipped to address the problem in a cost-effective manner. \"Sometimes patients think that sports medicine means taking care of the Huskies or the Seahawks, and it does,\" says Herring, one of the team physicians for the Seahawks and the Mariners. \"But we think there's an athlete in everyone. The same principles of comprehensive diagnosis and treatment that focus on restora-tion of function apply not only to elite athletes, but also to all people who want to be active.\" in Bartley's case, that treatment included spine surgery a year after the accident to remove a disc. \"it was overnight relief,\" she says. Then her sports medicine physician, Mark Harrast, M.d., chief Res. '00, UW clinical professor in the department of Rehabilitation Medicine, prescribed physical therapy as part of a comprehensive treatment plan to help her recover. it worked so well that Bartley was able to resume cycling, cross-country skiing and kayaking, among other sports. \"The care made it possible,\" says Bartley. \"it was invaluable.\" a new Husky location This level of integrated sports medicine care is now available at the UW Medicine Sports Medicine center, located at Husky Stadium. With the addition of this new facility, sports medicine care is available in several locations: the stadium, Harborview Medical center, Roosevelt and the eastside Specialty center. Peter c. esselman, M.d. '86, Res. '87, '90, chair of the department of Rehabilitation Medicine, knows patients will benefit from the new center's exercise performance space. Physical therapists like Wallerich have much more room to treat their patients. and he, like Herring, is excited about the opportunities for collaboration at the center, where different specialists work under one roof \u2014 cross-pollinating research ideas and care options, working in tandem to train students and fellows, and, most importantly, caring for the people who need their help. \"The new facility provides terrific support for the team approach to patient care,\" says esselman.

Shocking, but all too frequent. One in 250 high school-aged youth have a potentially serious heart condition at risk for Sca. and many youth are physically active. \"Our research shows that high school-aged students who are athletes are at four times the risk of having a sudden cardiac arrest compared to their age-matched student non-athletes,\" says Jonathan a. drezner, M.d., Fel. '00, UW professor in the department of Family Medicine. drezner is convinced that using electrocardiograms (eKGs) to screen teens is the key to improving heart safety in young athletes. Most young people with a potentially lethal heart condition don't show the warning signs of Sca, so history-based physi-cal exams alone are very limited. an eKG, however, is a simple, non-inva-sive test that can indicate a potential problem to a trained eye. Still, he has a caution. \"The interpretation of the eKG isn't simple,\" says drezner. Physicians have to be trained to differentiate the truly abnormal \u2014 a reading that indicates a cardiac disorder may be present, for instance \u2014 from readings that simply indicate a strong, athletic heart. Working with the nick of Time Foundation, drezner and other medical volunteers have been hold-ing school-wide heart screenings in the Seattle area and beyond for the past three years, screening more than 8,000 high-school students and student athletes. and the events show results. at a screening held last fall, volunteers discovered that Seattle-area student Will Recla had a heart murmur. Further testing showed that the young runner had a faulty heart valve and a damaged aorta. The aorta could have ruptured; if it had, the incident probably would have been fatal. Today, after open-heart surgery, Recla is back on the track. With the opening of the new- est UW Medicine Sports Medicine center, located at Husky Stadium, drezner and his colleagues are opening another avenue of care for families like Recla's: the Sports cardiology Program. \"With the launch of the program, we want to offer this advanced heart screen to any kid at any time,\" he says. Recla's story is a good reminder of the importance of expert care and follow-up. \"He had a finding, a heart murmur...that i think most physicians could hear,\" says drezner. \"What a physician does next matters.\" A Running Start: Screening Young Athletes at Husky Stadium< for the athlete in everyone The New U w Medici Ne Spor TS Medici Ne ceNTer, Loca Ted a T hUSky S TadiUM Space Features 30,000 square feet \u2014 10,000 dedicated to sports performance and physical therapy \u2014 under Husky Stadium's south grandstand Services and specialties Includes orthopedic surgery, rehabilita- tion medicine, family medicine, sports medicine, radiology, sports performance and physical therapy equipment Uses high-tech instruments for diagnosis and treatment, including ultrasound, electromyography (EMG), and an anti-gravity treadmill, which reduces gravity's effects on joints during recovery and re-conditioning Healthcare professionals Includes professionals who are active athletes, medical researchers and educa-tors, and physicians for Olympians and teams at the professional, collegiate and high-school levels education Provides a superb training ground for medical students, residents, fellows and other trainees and practitioners to learn about different specialties fall 2013 1314 UW Medicine for the athlete in everyone > Optimizing Performance: A team Sport new Zealander Bruce T waddle, M.B., ch.B., FRacS, is no newcomer to Seattle, having trained as a trauma fellow at Harborview Medical center. now he has returned, in part for the opportunity to work at the newest UW Medicine Sports Medicine center, located at Husky Stadium. There he will continue to explore two of his favorite topics: sports performance optimization and injured tissue, particularly tendons. When T waddle \u2014 a surgeon and professor in the depart- ment of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine \u2014 talks about optimizing performance after tendon injury and recovery, he's very interested in activity at the cellular level. \"How do we make that tendon cell want to be the best recovered tendon cell it can be?\" he asks. Part of the answer lies in changing the tendon's cellu- lar environment. \"Rest is not the best way,\" says T waddle. Rather, exercise, especially exercising in water or with a low-gravity treadmill, helps speed recovery. applying just the right levels of stress, weight and movement is also key, both for tendons and other parts of the body. and, as rehabilita-tion medicine grows ever more sophisticated, he and his colleagues tailor programs that take into account not only the athlete's injury, but also their activity. \"You can use inventive ways to rehabilitate someone for a specific sport,\" says T waddle. The post-surgery program de-signed for a swimmer with a knee injury, for instance, would be distinctly different from that developed for a basketball player. The stress, the weight, the movement applied through therapy: all different. it's a brave new world in sports medi-cine, one that requires collaboration. \"You have to get buy-in from the athletes and the athletic trainers,\" says T waddle. \"They need to have a clear under - standing of what we are all trying to achieve. injury recovery should be a team sport, too.\" Read about another therapy for tendons, platelet-rich plasma, on page 22.

Do you know that you're only 10 percent 'you'?\" This is how John M . Inadomi, M .D ., professor of medicine, head of the Division of Gastroenterology and the Cyrus E . rubin Endowed Chair in Medicine, starts a discussion about the gut microbiome . Consisting of a vast colony of bacteria, viruses, yeast and other flora that live in the intestines, the microbiome is made up of 10 times more cells than its human host . These microorganisms help digest and metabolize, and \u2014 as they sample food and bacteria the host ingests \u2014 help train the immune system to identify invading pathogens . Unfortunately, the immune system is fallible . Sometimes it turns on itself, causing autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) like Crohn's disease and colitis . researchers like Inadomi suspect that the microbiome plays a role in the development of IBDs . \"It's not a huge leap to think that if you have disorders of different flora in the gut, it can disturb immune function,\" says Inadomi . lynn Garvey has a very personal connection to IBDs . Her grandson was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, a condi-tion characterized by weight loss, diar - rhea and cramping, when he was 10 . \"It was devastating,\" she says . Search-ing for solutions, she and her husband, Mike, and her daughter and son-in-law, Denise and Mark Tabbutt, decided to invest in a leader for UW Medicine's brand-new Center for Intestinal Microbiome research . The search for a director is under way . \"Their gifts give us a wonderful start,\" says Wesley Van Voorhis, M .D ., Ph .D ., head of the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine . Both Van Voorhis and Inadomi have high hopes for the research to come \u2014 research that could lead to direct interventions in the microbiome and less toxic drug therapies for IBD sufferers . Garvey and her family have high hopes, too . \"I would like to see treatments that are long-lasting and don't have side effects,\" she says . She also has every confidence in the people she's support- ing . \"I like the collaboration they Garvey . \"It's a fabu- lous setting for researchers .\" Collaboration will be key to the center's success, especially if it takes on the other conditions that may be con-nected with the microbiome, like obesity, childhood growth stunting and coronary artery disease . \"The list [of growing every day,\" says Van Voorhis . \"The center will contribute significantly not only to IBD but to even broader problems, and I am intensely excited about it .\" \" Photo: David Wentworth Photography UW Medicine yoUr co NTribUTio NS T o o Ur M iSSioN 19 It's never too late to begin anew .\" That was Ann ramsay-Jenkins' advice to Karla Kelly, who left a career as a CPA to pursue her dream of practicing medicine . ramsay-Jenkins knew what she was talking about . While at Skidmore College, she studied drama and then changed her major to public health . \"I've always loved theatre, but I wanted to do something that would have a greater impact,\" ramsay-Jenkins says . She went on to work in drug treatment facilities as well as in the Office of Drug Abuse Prevention in the White House . like ramsay-Jenkins, Kelly also felt the pull to service . She had worked as an accountant for 25 years (four of them at UW Medical Center), but she did not feel fulfilled . \"As an accountant...I didn't feel like I was giving back,\" she says . \"I wanted to be 'in the moment' with patients, to make a difference in their lives .\" Now in her fourth year of medical school, Kelly plans to practice family medicine or internal medicine at an urban community health clinic . Medical students like Kelly are the reason ramsay-Jenkins, a staunch UW Medicine advocate, and her late husband, William, created the William M . Jenkins and Ann ramsay-Jenkins Endowed Scholarship . \"Getting a medical education is so expensive, and a student's debt load often determines what their career choices are,\" she says . \"This scholar - ship can make it possible for students to pursue work in underserved communities where salaries are often less lucrative but doctors are so needed .\" recently, ramsay-Jenkins decided to enhance the scholarship by planning a gift through her will . \"I feel fortunate to be able to do it,\" she says . \"I wanted to say 'thank you' for all the wonder - ful experiences at UW Medicine . And I wanted to provide students with greater opportunities .\" As for the influence the ramsay- Jenkins' scholarship has had on Kelly's education? \"It allows me to stay true to my specialty,\" she says . \"Primary- care doctors are the frontline of the underserved .\" STarTiNg aN ew Advocate and student feel the pull toward medicine \" Scholarship student Karla Kelly (left) met with the donor to her scholarship, Ann Ramsay-Jenkins, at UW Medical Center.

She was one of the few children who went to high school in her wheat-farming community . \"It was very unusual at the time,\" says Kathryn Warner, Nesbit's niece . \"But Marie's father, my grandfather, insisted that all five of his children not only go to high school, but attend college as well .\" The time was the 1930s, and the place was Farmer, a small town 40 miles east of Wenatchee in Eastern Washing- ton . Nesbit went on to attend Central Washington University, where she graduated with a teaching degree and met her husband, robert . \"They lived very quiet, academically oriented lives,\" says Warner of her aunt and uncle, who earned a Ph .D . in history from the University of Washington . \"And they were very frugal .\" Nesbit sewed her own clothes and made her own coats . She and her husband often walked, rather than drove, to get from place to place in Olympia, Wash ., where they made their home . Though the Nesbits lived a modest life, they contributed generously to priority funds at Harborview Medical Center, University of Washington Medical Center and Airlift Northwest, a UW Medicine transport service for the critically ill or injured in remote areas of Alaska, Idaho, Montana and Washington . All part of UW Medicine, these organizations provide world-class care to people from all walks of life . Contribu- tions to priority funds make it possible for UW Medicine to provide the highest level of care to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay . It was a mission Nesbit believed in, and when the time came to prepare a will, she chose to benefit the programs she supported while she was alive . \"This was a wonderful gift,\" says Johnese Spisso, r MPA, UW Medi-cine's chief health system officer . \"We pride ourselves on providing exceptional care without exception, and Mrs .

Such was the case for breast cancer survivor Trish May when she first met Mary l . \"Nora\" Disis, M .D Disis, an oncologist and immunolo- gist, speak at a conference about cancer research, and she approached Disis during the coffee break to learn more . After their discussion, May recalls thinking, \"This is very innovative and important research! I have to raise money to support Dr . Disis' work and other breakthrough research like it .\" And raise money she did . May estab- lished the nonprofit Athena Partners \u00ae, named for the Greek goddess of wisdom and strength, and created Athena Bottled Water \u00ae to increase awareness about breast cancer and generate funds to support research . In 2013, gifts from the Athena Partners Foundation established the Athena Distinguished Professorship of Breast Cancer research \u2014 awarded to Disis \u2014 and the Athena Endowed Award for Excellence in Breast Cancer research, awarded to Christine Fang, M .D ., UW assistant professor in the Depart- ment of radiation Oncology . In addition to recognizing distin- guished support their leading-edge work . \"This professorship is tremendous \u2014 not only for me, but the lab,\" says Disis, UW professor of medicine in the Division of Medical Oncology, with appointments in pathology and obstetrics and gyne- cology . \"It will allow us to develop new therapies and learn how to make existing therapies work better .\" Early next year, Disis and her team expect to begin clinical trials for a vaccine targeting breast cancer stem cells . The Athena Award was established to recognize the contributions of early-career researchers, and Fang's contributions already have made a mark . She invented the Calypso breath-hold technique, which reduces exposure to the heart during radiation treatments for breast cancer . According to Disis, awards like this can make a difference for the whole field . \"They allow up-and-coming scien- tists to develop ideas to the point they can obtain larger grants,\" she says . \"We are all very grateful for these gifts .\" reachiNg For a cU re Entrepreneur battles breast cancer by investing \"It's a great privilege to work with patients,\" says radiation oncologist Christine Fang, M.D., pictured here with a linear accelerator at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. She uses the accelerator in tandem with a Calypso unit, which \u2014 by tracking signals from electro-magnetic transponders placed on the skin's surface \u2014 helps to ensure that the heart stays out of the path of the radiation beam. Fang was recently honored with the Athena Endowed Award for Excellence in Breast Cancer Research.

She wanted to make sure her trainees were abreast of the latest technology . What she didn't realize was that the technology would transform her practice . \"I can't really imagine practicing without ultrasound...it's sort of like the stethoscope for the sports medicine doctor,\" says Harmon, UW professor in family medicine and orthopedics and sports medicine . Ultrasound is used extensively in diagnosis, as its detailed view of soft tissue allows physicians to assess the extent of degeneration, injury, tears and fluid build-up . The technology also helps to focus care and make decisions about treatments such as platelet-rich plasma, a therapy that Harmon and her colleagues use to treat injured tendons, notoriously resistant to self-repair . Using an ultrasound-guided needle, the physician injects patient-derived platelets, which stimulate healing, into the precise location of the injury . \"Unless you're in exactly the right spot, it's a waste of time and money,\" explains Harmon . When you're in the right spot, however, the treatment is highly effective . Six months after treatment, 70 percent of the patients are experienc-ing full or partial recovery . It is work like this that Kevin Goodwin, the president and CEO of SonoSite, admires . He also admires the work being done by Harmon's colleague, Jonathan A . Drezner, M .D ., Fel . '00, a UW professor in the Department of Family Medicine . Drezner uses ultrasound and EKGs to help determine the risk of sudden cardiac death in young athletes . \"Kim and Jon are leaders in their field,\" says Goodwin, whose company, based in Bothell, Wash ., manufactures ultrasound equipment . And in improving patient care, he says, \"you have to have educators who are believers and leaders .\"To that end, SonoSite made a gift that will allow UW Medicine to hire a musculoskeletal sonographer who, while caring for patients, will teach physicians and trainees how to use ultrasound . The gift also will fund an assistant researcher to support ultrasound-related work done by Drezner, Harmon and their colleagues . \"SonoSite's gift is making a huge dif-ference, allowing us to do more for our patients and helping train future genera-tions of physicians,\" says Harmon . As for Goodwin, he notes that the company enjoys promoting local, pioneering work in sports medicine . \"you're our home team,\" he says .

Fifty-some years ago, physicians at the hospital now known as Harborview Medical Center reviewed a fisherman's symptoms, looked at his extensive bruising and came to a conclusion: cancer . The two medical students who took his history came to a different conclusion: vitamin C deficiency . The students, one of whom was Kendall, were right . \"That was a thrill,\" Kendall says . This early experience left an impres- sion . At the time, it was unusual for medical students to see patients so early in their studies . later, after Kendall became dean of the medical school at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), he remodeled the curriculum to ensure that early experiences with patients \u2014 so motivating for students \u2014 would become part of the OHSU model . Many physicians can recall exemplars who inspired them, leading them to consider the profession of medicine, and Kendall had several . The first: rodney, his uncle, who was a physician . The second: the neurosurgeon who restored nerve function in Kendall's arm after it broke in high school . The third and fourth: the two men who saved his life after a deadly accident one icy January night at Boeing Field . Kendall and several other students were returning to undergraduate studies at yale when their plane crashed shortly after takeoff . \"A lot of people around me died,\" remembers Kendall . Doctors kept Kendall alive in the next few hours and days . local physician Silvio Vukov, M .D ., pulled Kendall \u2014 who had two broken arms and a burn on his head \u2014 out of the mud near the wreckage and administered first aid . later, Don Custis, M .D ., then chief resi-dent at Virginia Mason Medical Center, ordered an experimental antibiotic to treat Kendall's burn, which had become seriously infected . These men were Kendall's inspira- tion . And many years later, Kendall and his wife, Betty, are inspiring another generation of medical students with the creation of the John W . Kendall, M .D . and Betty M . Kendall-Paul G . ramsey, M .D . Student Support Fund . The Ken- dalls are using the gift to pay tribute to Dr . ramsey, the dean of the UW School of Medicine \u2014 and they also see it as a continuation of Kendall's career-long belief in medical students . In making the gift, Kendall remem- bers the role that receiving financial aid played in his own life . \"When I went to yale, there was no way I could afford to pay,\" he says . \"I'm very high on doing the best we can to provide scholarships .\" taking the Huckabay challenge In their quest to support students, the Kendalls and more than 450 other alumni and friends have taken advantage of a two-year-long match provided by the Huckabay family . In that time, the Huckabays and other donors raised $4 million in new funds dedicated to endowed scholarships and student support funds .

While Parenzin's attire never strays toward primary-colored l ycra, it seems quite likely that parents and children both consider him a bit of a superman \u2014 banishing illness, vanquishing problems, setting things right. That's not quite the way Parenezin sees himself. \"Medicine is a humbling profession,\" he says. The first P a to serve as a clinical faculty member at the UW School of nursing, Parenzin completed the MedeX northwest program in 2007. His specialty is pediatric orthopedics and sports medicine, and in addition to working at Seattle children's, he's also the clinical director of MedFest with the Special Olympics Healthy athletes Program. Parenzin considered becoming a physician, but, newly married and wanting to start a family, he added up the four years of medical school, plus an additional three to five years for a residency. Then he and his wife, charity, decided against it. \"i know there are real 'supermen' and 'superwomen' out there \u2014 amaz-ing physicians who have a family and do it all, and that's great,\" Parenzin says. \"i just knew i wasn't one of them.\" inspired by role models like former faculty member Grace landel, Pa-c, he opted to apply for the two- year MedeX northwest program, instead. One thoughtful decision followed another. after the first year of didactic training in Seattle, the second, clinical year of MedeX training consists of six months of one-month specialty rotations. Mindful of the importance of personal relationships, Parenzin set up many of those rotations himself, choosing places that wanted to work with P as. like other grads, he cannot praise MedeX highly enough. \"The program allows you to have a career helping others,\" he says. and that is precisely what Parenzin is doing. in addition to his practice, he performs pre- participation physicals \u2014 through the MedFest program \u2014 for Special Olympics athletes who lack access to physicians or can't afford the exam. \"i can never give back what i get from Special Olympics athletes,\" he says. \"They remind me of what's important.\" Parenzin may not be a superman, precisely, but he comes pretty close: with a busy work life, a full volunteer schedule and three young children at home, Parenzin is also finishing up his thesis for a master's in public health. \"it has taken me much too long to finish my MPH,\" says Parenzin. \"But my work with the Special Olympics is a continual reminder of the impor - tance of public health to an at-risk population, and of how relevant my education has been.\" Pediatric sports medicine specialist Patrick Parenzin, PA-C (Seattle Class 39), and his colleagues value their work with MedFest, a program connected with the Special Olympics .

When Holland arrived at Sloan-Kettering, he found a great clinical brain cancer program \u2014 but no organized and col-laborative research program. He changed all that. With the creation of the Brain Tumor center at MKSKcc, annual brain cancer funding from the national institutes of Health more than quadrupled, totaling approximately $10 to $15 million a year. \"now it's clearly one of the top five brain tumor programs in the country,\" Holland says. Why join UW Medicine and the Hutch?\"everyone is aware of where the strong programs are on the West coast, and the University of Washington is one of the top places, as is the Hutch. That's ultimately why i ended up coming to Seattle,\" says Holland. Using data to defeat brain cancer in Seattle.UW Medicine's department of neurological Surgery has amassed an impressive collection of brain tumor samples. \"it could well be the largest one in the country,\" Holland says. He and his colleagues are searching for funding to create a tumor database, linking a tumor's molecular profile with a patient's treatments and outcomes. This data will provide physicians a detailed look at which treatments were most a coNVerSatioN WitH caNcer leaDer eric HollaND, M.D., pH.D. successful with which tumors, allowing them to compare a new patient's tumor with previously collected samples to provide more personalized, focused care. \"The database will certainly make UW a magnet for people with the disease,\" says Holland. Big goals for the first year.\"What brought me here was the opportunity to build, orga- nize and make it a better place than it was before,\" Holland says. First, he wants to make it easier for patients to access services related to solid tumors. He wants to recruit faculty in disciplines such as neuropathology and radiation oncology for brain tumors. and Holland intends to increase efficien-cies in brain tumor research at the alvord center and in the Hutch's Human Biology division. cleaning up the lab. When we spoke, dr. Holland was back in new York, clean- ing out his old lab \u2014 including a multitude of slides from post-docs who worked with him and his colleagues over the years. \"i was able to reminisce over every post-doc as i emptied their box,\" he says. Recently recruited from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York, brain tumor researcher and neurosurgeon Eric Holland will fulfill a number of functions at UW Medicine and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Mullins, a UW professor of medicine in the division of allergy and infec-tious diseases, was the first scientist to obtain a federal grant to research aidS back in 1983. \"The more i read about this new disease, the more similar it sounded to an immunodeficiency disease \u2014 caused by feline leukemia virus \u2014 which i was studying at the time,\" Mullins says. \"Feline leukemia virus is a retrovirus, and i suspected that aidS was caused by one as well.\" Mullins' hunch turned out to be right, of course. caused by the HiV virus, aidS destroys white blood cells, leaving the body vulnerable to a host of diseases. according to the World Health Organization, 34 million people around the world are infected with the deadly virus. Thirty years since obtaining that first grant, Mullins continues to study HiV . in addition to developing vac-cines, his lab seeks to understand how HiV persists \u2014 how it hides in people who have been treated \u2014 as well as how it establishes itself in a new host. \"HiV is a highly evolved pathogen,\" says Mullins. \"By the time the immune system recognizes it and responds, the virus has already mutated.\" in fact, HiV mutates at least 1,000 times faster than the human genome, a major challenge for vaccine development. \"Vaccines work against certain features of a virus,\" says Mullins. \"if a strain doesn't have those features, then a vaccine won't have a protective effect.\" another obstacle is that HiV is not very immunogenic, meaning the virus fails to provoke much of a re-sponse from the body's immune system. despite these challenges, Mullins and his team persevere. currently, they're focused on developing the next generation of prophylactic vaccines \u2014 vaccines capable of warding off aidS. \"in 2014, we'll be performing a clinical trial to see if one of our vaccines is safe and whether it elicits responses from the immune system,\" says Mullins.if this trial is successful, Mullins will investigate whether the vaccine protects against HiV , a next step that will require significant financial invest-ment but could have immeasurable benefit to society. Whether or not the vaccine trial proves effective, one thing is certain: Mullins is dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of HiV . \"not only is it intellectually engaging work, but HiV is a puzzle that's critically important to solve,\" he says. This image demonstrates the possible forms and genetic pathways the HIV virus can take (indicated by the red lines) before its evolution is dominated by mutations that make the virus unique (indicated by the black lines) . The shapes at the end of the black lines represent virus samples from different eras of the epidemic . The triangles are the most recent .

Based on technologies pioneered by UW Medicine faculty Tomas Walsh, Ph.d., and Mary-claire King, Ph.d., UW-OncoPlex is a dna sequencing tool that helps physicians apply precision medicine \u2014 medicine focused on a specific patient \u2014 in treating advanced cancer. Thus far, Pritchard and Walsh have tested more than 20 types of cancer, most common-ly using the tool for lung, colon and breast cancers, as well as melanoma, sarcoma and leukemia.UW-oNcopleX: USHeriNG iN preciSioN MeDiciNe Precision medicine, sometimes called personalized medicine, is the Holy Grail of medical care. With UW-OncoPlex, patients at Seattle cancer care alliance (Scca) are getting a glimpse of the future of healthcare. colin Pritchard, Ph.d. '05, M.d. '07, Res. '10, offers the example of an advanced-stage lung cancer patient seen at the Scca. about a year ago, his tumor was deep- sequenced with UW OncoPlex. When the tool uncovered a mutation in the patient's alK gene, physicians then chose a therapy that targeted that gene's activity. after receiving precisely the treatment he needed, the patient is doing well. Medical technologists Christina Smith, B .S . '84 (standing), and Karen Koehler, members of the Department of laboratory Medicine, are part of the team that uses the UW-OncoPlex tool . The tool has two great assets in pinpointing genetic contributors to cancer: accuracy and cost. \"The accuracy of the results in the genes analyzed is generally...much better than whole-genome tech-niques,\" says Pritchard, noting that UW-OncoPlex is focused and digs deep into genetic information. it's also less expensive \u2014 doing genetic analysis on a tumor totals approximately one-tenth the cost of analyzing a patient's entire genome. Testing for genetic information is one step; helping physicians trans-late genetic information is another. Pritchard and Walsh and their col-leagues make frequent presentations to providers on cancer's front lines, including Scca oncologists, oncology nurses and genetic counselors. What's more, the test isn't limited to Seattle-area patients. it can be ordered by physicians around the nation \u2014 even internationally. What's next for UW-OncoPlex? \"The test was designed with flexibil-ity in mind,\" says Pritchard. as more cancer-related genes are discovered, the tool will incorporate them. and in the not-too-distant future, the tool may be used to take on diseases other than cancer. \"We've gotten a lot of inquiries from physicians interested in using the test to look for inherited muta-tions rather than tumor mutations,\" says Pritchard, \"and we're working on validating the assay for this purpose.\" top of Mind >Fall 2013 29< top of Mind Heidi combs, M.d. '00, Res. '05, and andrew luks, M.d., Res. '03, Fel. '07, (both pictured above), agree that witnessing students' \"a-ha\" moments is one of the biggest perks of being a teacher. combs and luks were both recognized as Teacher Superiors in Perpetuity at the UW School of Medicine graduation ceremony on June 1, 2013. This honor, held by only 21 other teachers in the School's history, is bestowed upon those who have received the distinguished Teaching a ward from the graduating class four times. Below, combs (Hc), a UW assistant professor in the department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and luks (al), a UW associate professor of medicine in the division of Pulmonary and critical care Medicine, answer a few questions about their experiences teaching and what it's like to receive such an accolade. How did learning at UW Medicine relate to your decision to teach? Hc: My teachers at UW Medicine were particularly skilled at interpersonal communication \u2014 actively listening to patients and responding with compassion. Their mentor - ship was invaluable to me, and now i get to model that same behavior for my students. al: in medical school, i found teaching was really hit or miss. Then when i came to UW Medicine as a resident, i noticed a really strong culture around education. i always knew i wanted to teach \u2014 even before i went into medicine \u2014 but it helps that the School, particularly my division, sets the tone that teaching is valuable. What informs your approach to teaching? Hc: Psychiatry is kind of an underdog field. My goal is to inspire students \u2014 regardless of what they plan to specialize in \u2014 to see why psychiatry is relevant to them. WHo MaKeS a SUperior teacHer? oUr alUMNi al: enthusiasm is really important. You can gain a lot of mileage by simply being passionate about your topic and taking the time to relay that to students. What do you enjoy most about teaching? Hc: When we're on rounds and students ask me why i did something. it forces me to be honest about my diagnosis, to understand the real reasons behind my decisions, and to keep abreast of the best treatment options for my patients. al: i really like the follow-up. When i bump into students that i taught in the classroom, who are now on their third- and fourth-year rotations, it's great to hear how they're doing and to talk with them about what they might like to specialize in. What has most surprised you about teaching? Hc: How much fun it is! i love having didactic sessions with med students \u2014 in fact, those are some of my favorite days. and when i don't have students or residents with me when i'm rounding, i miss them. al: Just when you think you've got it all figured out, it's time to evolve your approach. There's always more room for growth and improvement than you think. How does it feel to be recognized as a teacher superior in perpetuity? Hc: i'm the third woman and the only psychiatrist to ever receive this award. it's nice to know that students value what i teach, and it's validating for the patients i serve as well. al: it's not like you do it for the awards, but i put a lot of time and effort into teaching, so it's gratifying to know it's appreciated. it's a huge honor.

(as it happens, Montana also has grown: with the addition of 10 students this fall, the student cohort now numbers 30.) another innovation is in the works: WW aMi Spokane is the site of a second-year pilot program that began in august. Until now, students from all WW aMi sites completed their second year of medical school at the UW campus in Seattle. With the pilot, 19 second-year students (15 of whom also spent their first year in Spokane) will complete their second year in Spokane. continuation of the pilot is dependent on future funding from the legislature. cHaNGeS to tHe WW aMi laNDScapeWW aMi MeMorieS news of changes in the WW aMi landscape prompted a few reminiscences from alumni. Greetings from Eastern Washington. Just received your letter detailing the upcoming changes at the Pullman/Moscow WWAMI site. I was very sorry to hear that such an incredible learning environ-ment will so significantly change, but am glad to know it is doing so to accommodate a growing program. My first year (E-96) of medical school was truly on of the most memorable times in my life. I have several fond memories of rolling back and forth between each campus in the WWAMI van. Much laughter and many stories about our lives were shared during these short but fun-filled trips. I will forever be grateful for this formative year, the friends I made and the unique and memorable experiences that could not be reproduced at any other site. \u2014John T. Droesch, M.D. '00, Res. '05 My most vivid memories involve the gross anatomy lab, where I took my future wife on a quick tour while on a dinner date, and where our storied anatomy professor... hosted Saturday morning \"tupperware parties\" wherein he would break out plastic containers of various body parts for those who hadn't gotten their fill during the regular weekday sessions. \u2014Peter J.

'96, Fel. '99, clinical professor of medicine in the division of Gastroenterology and director of the digestive disease center. along with Bruce Silverstein M.d., Fel. '69, clinical professor of medicine in the division of Gastroenterology, Saunders is co-chair of the 10-person, all-volunteer teaching team for the course, attended and highly rated by second-year students. \"Students hear about the patient's struggles, what led to the diagnosis, how it's being managed and what procedures they go through,\" he says. The class's structure, which includes a lecture and small-group discussions, is significant to the course's success. it was implemented by the late cyrus Rubin, M.d., and other faculty members from the division of Gastroenterology. Saunders' father, the late david R. Saunders, M.d., was one of these pioneers. He began teaching the course in 1974 and taught it for 34 years. \"i still talk to gastro physicians and internists who call about patients, and it will always come up that they took 'The Gut course,' and they will say how dad was one of their favorite instructors,\" says Saunders. By the time Saunders graduated from the Medical college of Wisconsin and attended UW Medicine for a residency, his father had been teaching \"The Gut course\" for almost 30 years. in those three decades, his father won the distinguished Teaching award so many times that, in 2002, he was given the honor of Teacher Superior in Perpetuity. \"dad was a true scholar. He was part of a dying breed. You think of an academic position and you think of a researcher, a teacher or a clinician. To find all three in one person is rare now,\" says Saunders. \"But he was one of them, and he enjoyed teaching most.\" Two generations of the Saunders family have played a major role in developing \"The Gut Course\" for second-year students .

The beginning of Fisher's ath- letic and professional journey began, however, when she was a good deal younger \u2014 and absorbed by a com-pletely different sport. \"i was three years old when i got my first tennis racket,\" Fisher says. She played competitively at the University of Montana while studying wildlife biology, and she and her best friend, Sara Jackson, taught tennis at a sum-mer camp in chicago. The two had big plans. When they returned to Missoula, Mont., in the fall, Fisher and Jackson were going to share an apartment. and they were going to become teachers. everything changed on June 30, 2002, during their road trip from chicago to Missoula. Fisher doesn't remember the car accident on i-90 that cost her left foot and \u2014 in a heartbreaking turn of events \u2014 took Sara Jackson's life. What she does remember is the doctors' decision to amputate her foot and the long road to recovery that, thanks to physical therapy, became the road to athletic excellence. Fitted with a prosthetic foot, Fisher did her first triathlon two years after the accident and 11 months after the amputation. later she became deeply interested in cycling, and when she developed a painful hip injury in 2010, she began work with a physical therapist. \"My PT was awesome,\" says Fisher, and she credits the PT not only with alleviating her pain, but also with helping her win two Paralympic med-als. \"She gave me the confidence that i could lead a fulfilling, pain-free life, and that i had what it took to be-come a physical therapist, too.\" Fisher then decided to apply to the physical therapy program at UW Medicine. dissection, anatomy \u2014 Fisher enjoys school, and she admires her teachers' expertise in their fields. She's also appreciated the curriculum; even in the program's first two years, when students are mostly based in the classroom, they still have contact with real patients. MAkiNg gAiNs: Cyclist and Student Megan Fisher Physical therapy student Megan Fisher, center, wins the gold for the cycling road time trial at the Paralympic Games in london in 2012 . Fisher remembers one such patient, who was recuperating from a stroke and having trouble walking. The students made a suggestion: practice walking in front of a mirror. it worked so well \u2014 an asymmetrical gait evolv-ing into a neutral gait right then and there \u2014 that the patient started to cry. So did the students. \"it was proof that there were still gains to be made,\" says Fisher. Fisher is uncertain what her future holds. She may return to practice in Missoula, Mont., where she owns a house and some chickens. She's con-sidering working in a clinic, though she's unsure of the specialty she might like to pursue: sports medicine, oncology, pediatrics. not least, the former tennis instructor is considering earning a doctorate and becoming a teacher \u2014 in anatomy and physiology. There are professors Fisher would like to emulate, and she remembers the long-ago plan that she formulated with her friend, Sara. First, though, there are more cycling competitions. and a wedding. and a graduation. \"i want to do every-thing right now,\" Fisher says. if history is any indication, she will.
