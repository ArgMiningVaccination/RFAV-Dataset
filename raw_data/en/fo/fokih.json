It has proven ineffective and has divided the practice of medicine into specialties, forgetting that the body functions in a constant state of homeostasis- all systems reliant on each other to function optimally. I believe that treating the underlying issue, down to the molecular basis, is what needs to be addressed in order to treat and eventually heal the disease. Unfortunately diseases have been categorized into separate entities when there is a common thread that is shared between them. My goal is to heal the mind & body as whole through integrative medicine.
