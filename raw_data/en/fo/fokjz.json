Multiple studies have shown patients with Stargardt have reduced ocular blood flow and there is now increasing evidence that this reduced ocular blood flow in the choroid and choriocapillaris is associated with the development and progression of the disease. Our breakthrough and revolutionized Netra Restoration Therapy (NRT) will help restore normal blood flow to your eyes, reduce inflammation and help stop progression and restore vision. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of areas of RE atrophy revealed more pronounced rarefaction of the choriocapillaris flow signal in Stargardt Disease. Study shows alterations in the total thickness, morphology, and the individual vascular layers of the choroid in eyes with Stargardt disease. Choroidal vascularity index is significantly lower in patients with inherited retinal diseases than in healthy age-matched individuals. Modern scientific research has shown that Herbal Medicines and Acupuncture helps reduce ocular inflammation, improve ocular blood flow to the retina and supplies nutrients which helps reduce intraocular pressure, VEGF expression, and increase oxygen and nutrients supply to the eyes. Our Netra Restoration Therapy (NRT) is a breakthrough and revolutionized treatment method which offers visible vision improvements in just under two weeks. Mr. Philip Mr. Nikil "}
