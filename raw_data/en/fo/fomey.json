This view of the evolving human beingprovides a cornerstone for the unfolding of the curriculum in Waldorfschools around the world. In her book Passages Gail Sheehy writes about the phases of life and underlines the perspective that an understanding of life's developmentalframework is necessary to answer life's questions. The analyticalpsychologist Carl G. Jung was a strong supporter of the developmentalmodel in education, and Bernard Lievegoed in his book Phases amplifies both Steiner's and Jung's thoughts. Interest in the developmental view ofthe human being has also been furthered through the works of Jean Piaget,Erik Erikson, and the Gesell Institute. All of this work is evidence of theevolution of a more conscious, scientific form of understanding social andemotional growth based on the wholeness of the human being. The concept of stages, phases, or developmental periods is rooted deep in history. Christopher Schaefer mentions that the Chinese talked aboutthree phases: receiving from the world (0-21), fighting in the world (21-42),and the age of peace and wisdom (42-death). The Greeks looked at 10 periodsof life comprised of seven year periods: (0-7) was the time of fantasy, (7-14)was middle childhood where learning began, (14-21) was the time ofdiscipline and military service, (21-28) was when one established a basisfor one's life, and so forth. The Romans had a simpler form with five stages. By understanding the stages of life, we educators gain empathy for the young people we guide. It lifts us above base personality to thesuprapersonal. We can recognize a greater tapestry through which life isweaving. This collection of translations and supportive articles from German, Swedish, Norwegian, British and American journals focuses on childdevelopment and pedagogical issues from the Waldorf perspective. It ishoped that the reader will find them valuable to study and useful asresources in striving to truly serve the young people we are helping navigateto their individual ego consciousness. \u2014 David Mitchell4.Lehrer Rundbrief Bund der freien Waldorfschulen Hausmannstrasse 44 70188 Stuttgart Germany Padaeia A Journal for Teachers in Waldorf Schools Steiner/Waldorf Schools Fellowship Kidbrooke Park Forest Row Sussex RH18 5JBGreat Britain Child and (now Fellowship The Cresset Journal of the Camphill Movement Camphill Association of North America 20 Triform Road Hudson, NY 12534-4542 USAThe editor appreciates the support of the Council of the Pedagogical Section for its assistance in finding a few suitable articles.

How often have we asked ourselves these questions! Is it teaching in blocks? Organizing the day around a main lesson? Continuing as a classteacher from year to year with the same group of children? Teaching in pictures? Knowing about reincarnation and karma? Teaching woodwork, painting, bookbinding, recorder, eurythmy? Rudolf Steiner says, \"What is of most importance for the teacher is his conception of life and of the world. . . . The inspiration that flows tothe teacher from a world conception inwardly and ever newly experienced is carried over into the soul constitution of the children entrusted to him.\" 1 In other words, this means that we should learn to \"read\" the world and the riddle of man's being in quite new ways. \"Theremust arise in the whole human nature of the teacher an intensiveimpression of the child, again as one whole being, and what is perceived in the child must awaken joy and vitality. This same spirit-awakening joy and vitality in the teacher must be able to grow and develop, till it becomes immediate inspiration, answering the question, 'What am I to do with this child or with that?' . . . We must pass from the reading ofhuman nature in general to the reading of the individual human-being!\" 28.This conception of what constitutes the central life force in education should pervade the training of teachers from beginning to end\u2014or, better said, from the beginning on, for there is actually no end. The older a teacher gets, the more he knows that he is only at the beginning! In the extraordinary little book from which we have quoted above, known in English translation as The Essentials of Education3 (five lectures, Stuttgart, April, 1924), Rudolf Steiner. devotes a brief passage in the central lecture to the possibilities inherent in a whole new approach to the education of teachers. His few remarks open up perspectives for a lifetime of endeavor. He points to a fourfold penetration into man's fullhuman being. Describing this, as he does again and again, he points to the fact that we are not only the human being whom we observe with our ordinary senses. In addition, this physical organism is imbued with life, and it is further permeated by consciousness, and the physical body, life body, and consciousness are all in their turn penetrated and organizedby the individuality itself, working spiritually into the members of its total being. To the trained investigator of the spirit, each of these four realms of forces is perceptible to the appropriate organ. Just as our physical senses observe the physical, so other senses, not dependent on the physical organism, can be developed to perceive the realms of livingprocesses, of consciousness, and of the activity of the ego. Our effectiveness as teachers depends on the ability to experience these four realms in man and in the worlds to which he belongs and on our ability to learn to see how they unfold from one stage to the next in the development of each child. Learning to \"read\" the nature of these forces,how they reveal themselves in the bodily organism, and how they develop throughout the first twenty-one years of life is basic education for the teacher. The burning question for the teacher is: How can I school these faculties of perception and learn to read, in a new way, the language of a child's development?9.In the third lecture of Essentials in Education , Rudolf Steiner hints how this might be done. Fundamental is a thorough knowledge of the child's physical being and of the physiological changes that are the outer milestones of his inner development. Beyond this, the teacher should learn to experience those forces of growth and vitality, which mold and differentiate and organize the physical, working like an invisible sculptorduring the earliest years of life to shape the child's organism in the image of his or her own individual blueprint of development. To this field of vital, sculptural, image-forming powers, Rudolf Steiner gives the term \"etheric-formative forces.\" We come to know this realm, he says, \"when we live into the formative-molding process, when we come to knowhow a curve or an angle grows through the shaping power of inner forces.\" We cannot understand the etheric body through the ordinary laws of nature, but with what we experience in the hand, the spirit- permeated hand. Hence, there ought to be no training of teachers without activity in the sphere of plastic art, of sculpture, an activity proceedingfrom the inner being of man. It is not at all necessary to know masses of modern examination matter. Though there is no harm in referring to an encyclopedia, no encyclopedia can give us that mobility, conferred by able knowledge and knowing ableness , necessary for an understanding of the etheric body, because the etheric body does not proceed according laws of nature; it permeates the human being in formative, sculptural activity. If, with the help of the \"spirit-permeated hand,\" we gain a feeling for the quality of the etheric-formative forces, even though we may yet be a long way from experiencing them in full awareness, we find that wecan teach the elementary school child in quite a new way. These forces worked invisibly as image-making powers within a child's physical organism during the imitative years and are now partially liberated, after the change of teeth, as the powers of imagination. For these are the forces10.with which the child learns to divine the hidden meanings within and behind the pictures in which the world presents itself to his awakening consciousness. We must also be well aware that the spirit-permeated hand has itself been intensively trained and educated. It is no longer the hand that is limited to the shaping of the merely useful or practical, important as these are, nor the skillful hand which can reproduce outer likenesses,nor the talented hand which creates interesting abstract three-dimensional forms. Rudolf Steiner refers to the hand that can penetrate the shaping, mobile powers which have created the crystal and the plant, the animal bodies, and the dynamic symmetries of man. To reveal these powers is the goal toward which the great sculptors of our time are striving, andthe teacher must awaken kindred powers in herself if she wishes to know \"how a curve or an angle grows through the shaping power of inner forces.\" She will not be satisfied merely to know about these sculptural forces, which have built the collarbone and shaped the pelvis and the skull, but she is willing to experience them in the disciplined work of herown hands. Therefore, she will seek out teachers who have themselves gone a certain distance along the path toward a new sculptor's art, such as practiced in the Goetheanum School of Sculpture, part of the School of Spiritual Science arising out of Anthroposophy. And if the teacher wishes to know something of the reality of those powers set free for the use of the soul at puberty, he must strive todiscover what lives in the whole dynamic world of musical experience. He must learn to hear, in the acoustics, the inner movement, the intervals, and move from tone to tone in the scale. This body of forces is the bearer of consciousness, of sentience, of feeling in the animal and in man, whatRudolf Steiner designates as the astral member of man's being. It is, he says, \"not natural history, natural science, or physics; it is music. . . . A man who studies the outer human organization insofar as it is dependent on the astral body must concern himself with physiology not as a11.physicist, but as a musician. He must know the inner, formative music within the human organism.\"4 And again, the teacher who wishes to gain access to this realm will turn to those who have preceded him alongthe road toward mastership in the art that Bruno Walter spoke of as \"intrinsic musicianship.\" This art opens to us \"that vast, transcendental realm of the soul that harbors the springs from which music flows.\" 5 And in this effort, he will soon discover that he has an invaluable guide in the study of musical eurythmy wherein the intervals, tones, rhythms, and beat come to visible expression in movement. But the teacher who intends to work in the spirit of Waldorf education knows that he cannot stop with an understanding of thephysical, etheric, and astral realms. Without the individuality there is no capacity for memory, conscience, thought, motive, or speech. The single animal is the expression of his species. Man transcends his species and becomes the bearer of that indivisible entity that alone can take responsibility for what he thinks, for what and how he feels, and forwhat he does. It is this fourth member of man's being that Steiner refers to when he speaks of the human ego. To arrive at experienced knowledge of the ego, Steiner says that we must learn to understand the inner structure of speech. Not speech merely as conveyor of meaning, but the formative power of the sounds and rhythms of language as creativeactivity of the spirit in man. In this sphere, eurythmy is of invaluable assistance as it unites in the language of visible speech the vowels and consonants, the grammatical structure, as well as the elements of rhythm, picture, and meaning. In these brief indications of Steiner's lies the seed for a radical re- orientation of all teacher training, not only for those studying to becometeachers, but also, and perhaps even more importantly, for those who are already teachers and wish to grow and to deepen their capacities. As one works with the ideas Steiner sketched out for us seventy-five years12.ago, one comes to realize that behind them stands a conception of the world that places man as a being of body, soul, and spirit in living relation with the spiritual background of the cosmos and of world evolution. One comes to realize that it is indeed this world conception, \"inwardly and ever newly experienced,\"6 that becomes the source of inspiration for the teacher and gradually, over many years, awakens in him the creative capacity to know what he has to do in a given moment with a given child. _________________________ Footnotes: 1.

It was in the Renaissance that isolated researchers such as Leonardo da Vinci first showed a quickened interest in the subject. Two to three hundred years later, the evolution ofthinking and fundamentally important research by Goethe, Olken, Carus,and others created the basis for the study of embryology and the idea ofmetamorphosis associated with it. Systematic research in embryology wasonly well established after 1940. This new scientific possibility offered the public the ability to actively engage their thoughts on the interval where invisible transformation takesplace between two visible phenomena, since only isolated phenomena canbe found during pregnancy examinations or after miscarriages. Continuousdevelopment as it is described in textbooks cannot be directly observed . All that we see are microscopic \"snap-shots.\" This is the result of anactivity\u2014an invisible transformation, or metamorphosis\u2014in the interval14.between two visible forms. Films that show this continuous development are attempts to make the transformation graphically clear. However, italways remains invisible and can only be comprehended through theactivity of thought. It is just this activity of thought that is new. It has onlybeen possible for about one hundred years, since the end of the nineteenthcentury. It assumes the modern ability to transcend with consciousness thethreshold between that which can be perceived by the senses and that whichis extrasensory. Reproduction is a process of biological life, like breathing, blood circulation, digestion, and so forth. Maturation of sperm cells and egg cellsis a particular specialization of the reproduction process. Reproduction isconstant. For instance, the skin constantly renews itself, intestinal mucousmembrane, blood, and hair are always growing. Reproduction penetratesthe entire organism at varying tempos: The intestinal mucous membranerenews itself every four days, the skin every four weeks, the blood everyhundred days. The slowest substances are the nerves. They need about sevenyears in order to fully regenerate themselves. Within this intensive renewal activity, there is one that is specific\u2014 the formation of gametes (mature male and female reproductive cells). Thisis the only place where an organism biologically divides itself into maleand female. The gametes are formed within the genitals, in the gonads ofovaries or testicles. This intensive cellular fluid regeneration is the matter,indeed, the content of an organism. The preservation of form , however, can be found in the invisible archetypes. They come out of the astral body and are active in the life body,lead by the individuality, the \"I.\" The appearance of form is forevermaintained through constitutive archetypes that hide themselves fromsensual perception. The cells of a human body are not isolated but rather found in tissue, enmeshed in fluid, strands, and filaments. The human body is 75-95% liquid,15.depending upon age and organ. Human tissue is tender and weak in its structure since it has comparatively little firm material contained within alot of fluid. In tissue, substances are constantly transforming themselves.Confined by the skin, every cell is an organized collection of matter withinliquid. It is like a living drop that breathes, extends, and then concentratesitself. There is a moment of maximum extension (with the thinning of thefluid) and a moment of maximum concentration (with the thickening ofthe fluid). A cell pulses between the thinned, extended state and the thick,viscous, concentrated state. Chromosomes can only be observed as proteinstrands in the thicker phase, and at that time take on a characteristic form.As cells, they continue to pulsate, extending, thickening, and then thechromosomes dissolve. This dissolution is equal to the cell becoming chaos.It opens itself to the potency of formative forces in that it loses its earlierform in order to create itself anew. That is how the form is kept alive andthe re-forming of cells and tissue is ensured, depending upon the situationand need. Chromosomes, like other cellular structures, are the results of condensation of formative archetypes in matter and not causes of form characteristics. The word chromosome means \"a colored strand\"\u2014they are the structures that lend themselves the most to coloration when preparingcells for examination under a microscope. Genes are the conceptual partsof chromosomes that are arbitrarily apportioned along the length of thesestrands. The name comes from the word genesis and means \"divine creation.\" The Creator wants to be found in the smallest biological structure. Cell division (mitosis) is an important process of reproduction. Cells divide themselves through mitosis at differing rates. Meiosis is the special form of cell division in the gonads, a specialized exception found nowhereelse. In the process of mitosis, the cell doubles itself and divides in such a way that two new cells come about that quantitatively resemble each other.16.In the process of meiosis there are two phases: The first is a mitosis and the second is a division without a previous doubling. The end result is thatfrom one starting cell, four are created which, however, contain each only half the genetic material. This process pertains to the formation of sperm cells in the testicles. With the formation and maturation of egg cells in theovaries, only one egg cell is produced from every ancestral cell, and not four, because the others dissolve themselves as polar bodies during the process. After maturation, the gametes are excreted by means of spermejaculation or menstrual bleeding, and they die. Only when impregnationtakes place can an egg cell and a sperm cell, as a fertilized egg cell, live onin a new way and in a new form . Gametes themselves are not fertile. They expire after their long and complicated maturation if impregnation has nottaken place. However, simultaneous with fertilization they reach a newqualitative level of life, without dying. They serve as a development basis for the formation of a new organism that is biologically and materiallydifferent from the mother-organism, wherein the egg cell was formed, andfrom the father-organism, where the sperm cell was formed. Differentiation that occurs in the genetic stream and the gametes (reproductive cells): Just as gametes after their long maturation leave the organism and perish as infertile and biologically unfit cells other differentiating qualitiescan be determined. What are their differentiating qualities and role in the reproductive process? Let us begin with the egg cell . Already in the fourth week of pregnancy, within the embryo, there begins the organic construction of whatwill later become the new child's reproductive organs and the first cellsthat will develop further into sex cells. This construction is, at first, commonto both sexes and is still undifferentiated. After the fourth week of pregnancy,if the embryo develops further into a female organism, this biological17.composition develops one-sidedly towards the inside, back, and upward and loses the other spatial directions. However, the right-to-left symmetryremains. Then the ovaries develop as well as the uterus, the fallopian tubes,and the vagina. The long maturation of the egg cells is already initiated inthe ovaries in the fourth week of pregnancy but they will rest between thefirst and second phase of meiosis until puberty. The rhythmic ovulation process begins at puberty when month to month one \"egg cell\" is released from an ovary: one time from the right, one time from the left. During the hours of ovulation, a localized rise intemperature occurs around the ovary. A mature egg cell is one of the largestcells in the human body; measuring approximately 0.1 millimeters, it iswithin the realm of visibility. This cell is still not a mature egg cell becausethe second phase of meiosis is completed only during an eventualimpregnation. If no impregnation takes place, this immature cell dies andis expelled from a woman's body during menstruation, along with the spentuterine lining. The egg cell is a turbid cell without its own power of movement. It rests within the surrounding follicle and is moved into the uterus by theperistaltic action of the fallopian tube. This follows after two weeks ofbuilding up in the time between the last menstruation and ovulation. Thenthere is another two weeks of building up between ovulation and the nextmenstruation. The egg cell becomes chaotic through its differentiation andits comprehensive range of chemical potential. In this state of chaos, it isespecially sensitive and open to cosmic archetypes. From the fourth week of pregnancy, the male development also begins in the common organic construction during which phase the malegametes, the sperm or spermatozoa, are developed. The male organsdevelop towards the outside, the front, and downward. The right-to-leftsymmetry remains.18.Maturation of the sperm is also at rest until puberty. However, after puberty, sperm formation is not rhythmic or regular, and with every ejaculation\u2014which can occur many times a day and is influenced by sensualstimulation\u2014thousands of mature sperm are ejected and perish. Thereduced temperature of the testicles, which are outside the body, is criticalto male fertility. Sperm cells are one of the smallest cells in the humanorganism. Sperm is highly differentiated and thoroughly formed. It has a crystalline structure and, because of its high degree of crystallization, almostno chemical potential. Sperm are transparent cells with their own power ofmovement (disorganized, directionless, and fast). These are earthly qualities. So, it is clear that with the separation of the sexes, a kind of one- sidedness appears, an extreme polarization between the male and femalereproductive cells. At the end of the process, every gamete is biologicallyunviable and perishes. The following table shows a comparison of thepolarization: Female Male One ThousandsSlow to potential Crystallized19.The fertilization process is first initiated by a localized rise in temperature during ovulation. Once a month, between the last and next menstruation, in the middle of the menstrual cycle, a rhythmic temperaturerise occurs in the mother-organism. Within this warmth of ovulation, anegg cell is released along with its surrounding follicle. The last phase of eggcell maturation begins outside of the ovary. The released egg cell is receivedby one of the fallopian tubes and is moved further along towards the uterusby its peristaltic action. The egg cell is cooled somewhat in this process. Spermatozoa in the semen come toward the egg cell. Their path goes from the vagina in thedirection of the uterus. Sperm come from the outside, from a coolertemperature, and warm themselves along the way. That is the first step offertilization and takes place before the two cells come into contact witheach other. The undifferentiated, warm, chaotic state of the egg cell isdifferentiated and cooled by the sperm. Within the meeting of these twogenetic streams, a warmth organism is formed. The polarities of one-sidedand extreme cold and warmth are overcome. The individuality, the (\"I\")form the warmth organism from the balance that has occurred. The next step is the meeting of the gametes or reproductive cells. The egg cell is surrounded by thousands of sperm and in this moment arhythmic rotation begins that lasts approximately thirty-six hours. A bio-chemical glow begins. There is still no penetration by a spermatozoon, buta light-organism has formed accompanied by ordered and harmoniousmovement. This is the second step of fertilization. Now, the individuality of the child has overcome the cloudy and inert state of the egg cell and thetransparent, self-powered disordered-movement state of the spermatozoaand has again developed a light/movement organism out of the balance. The third step is what is traditionally known as actual fertilization, but is, in fact, the third process. A spermatozoon penetrates the egg cell,and its outer membrane chemically isolates itself from the mother-organism:20.The first immunity processes begin. The other sperms die and dissolve. The egg cell goes through its last maturing by a process of furtherundifferentiating and chaos and by secretion of the so-called polar body, aconcentrate of hardened cell material that is incapable of life. A rejuvenationof the egg cell occurs in this moment of intense activity between the eggcell and the differentiating determinations of the spermatozoon. Thespermatozoon loses its crystalline structure, swells up, expands, and thendissolves in the plasma of the impregnated cell. An egg has now beenformed\u2014a biological and genetically complete cell. This cell then dividesfor the first time (mitosis), and other divisions rhythmically follow. Thereis not yet any growth, merely cell divisions in geometric progression\u2014onebecomes two, then four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two, and so on. The morula isformed while still inside the fallopian tube (like a little mulberry orraspberry). This organism does not glow and has no power of movementitself. The entire activity is now chemical-biological and has relocated tothe inner, light organism. The organism has overcome the polarities ofpotential chaos. A crystal forms and builds a chemical organism out of thebalance, a new deed of the individuality. The fourth step of fertilization is implantation into the mucous membrane of the uterus that has built up in the two weeks aftermenstruation and reached a high point in its development around the timeof ovulation. Without fertilization (and the beginning of pregnancy), themucous membrane would again deteriorate, and the dead tissue would beexpelled with the next menstruation. With the implantation, which is anactivity of the child, the built-up state of the mucous membrane and thehormone situation maintains itself until birth. The morula is still inside the fallopian tube (right or left) and then goes out so that it can fall into the uterus between the fifth and seventh days after conception. During thisfirst experience with \"falling\" (weight, heaviness ), the morula reshapes itself into a blastula or blastocyst. Here we have an organism that on one pole21.has formed a bladder filled with intercellular fluid, while on the other pole the cells of the no-longer-existing morula are thickened. During the processof falling, a polarization appears between cell thickness and fluid lightness . This changes the form of the organism. If the blastocyst was not anindividualized, living totality, but rather an inorganic sphere, it would eitherburst in the mucous membrane or spring back into uterine space. However,it is embedded in the wall of the uterus\u2014rather like an act of acceptance orreceiving. The organism is now going through a new metamorphosis, andthere is a recoil as the inner activity of the organism stays within itself, andthere is a falling into heaviness but with a balancing buoyancy. A new fluid has formed at the pole where the cells were bunched. It is transparent, rich in silica, and poor in organic material, the amniotic fluid . The fluid that formed during the descent of the blastocyst is thicker,chemically active, and rich in material, the yolk sack fluid . In between is found the embryonic disk from which the body of the embryo will beformed. These two fluids are the first two enveloping organs of the embryo.In this fourth deed of the individuality, the separation of space that is typicalfor the female as well as the male sexual organs was overcome. Withimplantation a geographic location is chosen. A physical organism is formedthat takes part in the laws of weight and lightness and the dimensions ofspace. Fertilization, accompanied by the four deeds of the individuality that create balance, has overcome the extremely one-sided tendency to dis-similarity and separation of the sexes, and within one week and four stepshas formed an individual organism that carries immunity, an organism thatis four-fold in that it has the qualities of warmth, light, movement, and isbiologically/chemically and physically/geographically localized. Implan-tation, the last step of fertilization, is simultaneously the first phase of for-mation of the amnion. Fertilization and the organic forms that follow it, arealready the visible results of contention between the genetic material and22.the individual constitution of the incarnating child.The localized rise in temperature during ovulation of the mother-organism is the first accom-modating, genetic, organic activity that is encountered by the individual,the child who wishes to incarnate. It builds a bridge out of the earthly ge-netic stream to the individuality and its constitution, which was alreadyprepared before conception. The individual constitution prepares itself in a world that is inaccessible to sense observation, the world that is in the interval betweenvisible forms. A kernel of enthusiasm from the sea of will is what inflamesthe individual motive to incarnate and begin a new life. This \"midnight world\" before conception is the highest experience of spiritual developmentuntil after death. It is an awareness of the goals of human development inthe present time and a growing enthusiastic absorption for the task ofrealizing those goals within their karmic webs on earth. This enthusiasmfor the realization of the human acts like a magnet and draws the will towardthe solicitous interest of all the spiritual hierarchies. A body of differentiatedstarlight\u2014a star-body or astral body\u2014envelops this kernel of spiritualenthusiasm. The will of the hierarchies to take part, with their presence, inthe human creation of individuals is so great that the universe is threatenedwith becoming empty. But thanks to the cosmic reproduction force of healingand regeneration, the effects of the stars remain as envelopment aroundthe kernel of individuality and the beings themselves remain sustained inthe universe. A new body, a new covering, whether cosmic or etheric, nowalso belongs to the individual constitution. Each individual \"I\" forms itselfout of certain characteristics of its own, and this composition differentiatesit from others that are likewise formed out of the same components andproperties but in different configurations. This is the spiritual physicalbody\u2014one's own physical body within its spiritual being. It cannot yet beperceived by the senses because it is not yet penetrated by matter.23.This four-fold individual constitution has occasioned the meeting between father and mother out of a line of ancestors, and, from the time of fertilization, it will begin to penetrate the genetic stream, fusing, overcoming,and transforming the organism so that it becomes a tool for its own destiny.Enthusiasm for the development of humankind joins itself to the warmthas an organic agent; indeed, it is the warmth in the organic. The hierarchical will-archetypes work in light and in ordered movement. The chemicalactivity of the cells and cell divisions is subordinate to these archetypesthat imprint them into matter, and, through this organic connection, matteris transformed over time. The individual destiny that wants to fashion itselftakes on a form in this way and allows traces of its acts upon the earth intothe dimensions of space. The formation of the embryonic amnion began with the last step of fertilization\u2014the implantation. The embryonic disk, a two-layered cellulardisk in the middle of the sphere that embedded itself into the uterine mucousmembrane, will rest another two weeks during the formation of the amnion. The yolk sack is a thick, cloudy, chemically active organ. It is confined through one of the two embryonic disks called the endoderm or inner skin.Its functions are nutrition and metabolism. The amnion is a transparent, vitreous organ. Equipped with light and formative forces, it is chemically inactive. It is, in turn, confined by theother layer of the embryonic disk, the ectoderm or outer skin. The allantois (sausage-like) is another amnion organ, out of the yolk sack and differentiated as a protuberance with the functions of eliminationand detoxification. The entire outer spherical surface that is in direct contactwith the uterine mucous membrane, along with the mother-organism,constitutes the fourth amnion organ. Later the chorion further develops into the placenta. This organ intermediates between the two organisms, the mother and the fetal child.Within the mother-organism, the heredity\u2014the past \u2014resides, for the time24.of the pregnancy; this is the four-fold present organism of the child. This organism in turn carries or surrounds in its interior a third organism that will become the organism for the future. During the pregnancy, it will be elaborated upon by the individuality of the child for the time after birth.The four enveloping organs (embryonic amnions) fashion a completeorganism with these four systematic functions: a) Nutrition, metabolism Yolk Sackb) Transparency, form Amnion c) Elimination, detoxification Allantoisd) Exchange with environment, circulation Placenta (Chorion) The motor system, the limb system, is still missing from this organism. It is present in the embryo body, but it will first develop andmature after the birth in contention with the earthly forces. In the middlebetween these four enveloping organs is the embryonic disk that rests untilthe seventeenth day after conception. In the first week, fertilization is completed. It is finalized with implantation, the step that includes formation of the enveloping organs.By the end of the third week, the organism has been formed in which theindividuality will live until birth (amnions). The embryonic disk is in themiddle of this organism. From the seventeenth day until the end of thefourth week, the individuality molds the organism surrounding theembryonic disk until it is efficiently reorganized into an embryonic body.This body contains all the organs that will serve as tools for the individualityafter birth. By the end of the first month, the individuality has already builtup its own organism in one shot. The individuality exists not only inrelationship to space, but also to time\u2014the 36-hour rotation and glow inthe second step of fertilization, the day of implantation, and so forth. Every25.month of pregnancy has its own underlying characteristic. During pregnancy, the child experiences the course of the year for the first time.Birth comes at the end of the third quarter of this first year. The first threemonths after birth also belong to pregnancy because the individuality mustcontend with earthly conditions for the first time and ripens its physiologybased upon what is living in its environment. The development of the embryonic organs from the amnions begins on the seventeenth day after conception. Until then the embryonic disk isresting and the creation activity is in the amnions. The embryonic diskconsists initially of two skins, the ectoderm and the endoderm, whichconfine the yolk sack and the amnion sack. The first noticeable gesture of the reshaping of the embryonic disk occurs on the ectoderm around the seventeenth day. At the place where thehead pole will develop, an impression appears, as if an invisible finger hadimprinted it. Out of this the neural cavity develops away from the headpole. This indentation as well as the neural cavity determines the anatomicspatial bearing\u2014right, left, i.e. the lateral symmetry, caudal, dorsal, andventral. The neural cavity develops further into the neural tube, therebyclosing in amnion fluid that, from this point in time, will surround the nervesystem as cerebrospinal fluid. The first rudiments of the spinal cord andthe vertebrae have appeared. Later on, the back is reminiscent of theectoderm of the embryonic disk. The sensitive area around the fourththoracic vertebra is a memory of the area around that first impression. Thedisk form reshapes itself into an oblong showing the tendency to form likethe neural tube. An intermediate skin, the mesoderm, is formed betweenthe ectoderm and the endoderm. Now the rounding formation tendency ofthe endoderm and the yolk sack becomes spherical and is internalized inthe body. There are two polar formation tendencies clearly displayed. Chronologically, the first is the formation of the skin and the nerve-sense26.system from the ectoderm and runs linear, oblong, and towards the outside. The last formation chronologically builds the structure of the digestive andmetabolic systems from the endoderm and runs spherical, round, andtowards the inside. In the middle chronologically, between the linear andthe round tendencies, the rhythmic waves of the mesoderm are acting,mediating between the facing polar tendencies. Finally, the round tendency will form the typical round, circular shape of the embryonic countenance. Likewise, from the endoderm a tubedevelops, although internalized\u2014the structure of the digestive tract fromthe mouth to the anus with all the organs that belong to it. The content ofthis digestive tube is the yolk fluid, and the embryo is completelysurrounded by amniotic fluid. Connective tissue, the muscles and cartilage,is formed from the mesoderm. On one side, this connective tissue fills thespace between the nerve-system, the sense-organs, and the skin and, onthe other side, that of the metabolic-digestive systems. The chorion is the outermost sphere of the embryonic amnions and develops into the placenta. Here, outside the embryonic body, bloodformation begins. Islands of blood flow into the yolk fluid and penetratethe body. They favor certain stream paths that are enclosed by the mesodermand formed into blood vessels . Two main vessels, at first outside of the body, are formed at the heart, in front of what will be the ribcage, and thethroat directly underneath the developing head. However, before the ribcagecompletely closes, the heart penetrates and fills it. The urinary bladder and the sexual organs are formed from the allantois together with the endoderm and the yolk sack. Formation of thekidneys, however, comes out of the nerve system\u2014their beginning structureis located in the back of the brain. This structure develops from the brainimmediately under the skin in two rows of little \"pearls\" along the spinalcord further to the dorsal area. The \"pearls\" close to the head degenerateand those at the dorsal area wrap themselves, taking on the spherical27.without losing their lateral symmetry. Here a neural tendency is brought into the vicinity of the metabolic system. The lungs are formed from a protuberance of the digestive tract. By dividing in half the lungs are placed in a three-fold symmetry to thebranching of the bronchia and the alveolar system inside the ribcage\u2014rightto left, cephal and caudal, front to back. Here a metabolic tendency is brought into the vicinity of the nerve system. Simultaneously with lung formation, hand formation begins immediately followed by the feet, then the lower arms and calves, and finallythe upper arms and thighs. The lungs are formed together with the limbs.After the birth, they serve together in the life on earth and in the air. By the end of the fourth week, all the structures of the embryonic organs are formed. This process was completed in about ten days. In theprior three weeks, fertilization, implantation, and formation of theenveloping organs were completed. Birth usually happens at the end of the third quarter. The fourth quarter is the first three months of life outside of the mother-organism.Now important maturing processes and restructuring of the organs takeplace. These processes require contact with gravity and the atmosphereoutside the womb, but are still considered processes belonging to pregnancy. It is important to get to know the characteristic of each of the twelve months. The first month brings the summary of all the components of the enveloping organs and the body. Out of the gaze toward the past, it is anall-embracing acceptance of the universe and the first assimilation ofwholeness. With the help of Rudolf Steiner's indications for eurythmy, theformative gesture of Aries can be recognized.28. The second month shows the assimilation of the mobility of the universe, the first inner movements, the beginning physiology. The \"gaze\" turns to the present and future, the universe now in this life, the formativegesture of Taurus. In the third month, the individuality begins to experience the body. The first tactile experiences follow. The hands and feet touch each other,the two sides touch each other, the formative gesture of Gemini. In the fourth month, the body's immunity and resistance are so far structured and developed that the formative gesture of Cancer can be recognized, to close oneself off from the environment. These first fourmonths have, as their priority, formation out of the universe, starting fromthe head. In the fifth month, the inner regions of the organism have been filled, the ribcage developed, the gesture of Leo. In the sixth month, important maturing processes take place. From this month onward, the body exhibits more and more organic resistance inorder to survive a possible premature birth, the gesture of Virgo. The seventh month brings new contentions with weight and heaviness for the pregnant woman. The child practices balance andplacement, the gesture of Libra . The eighth month can bring with it the danger of reciprocal poisoning, the first contention with earthly matter, the nearness of deatharound the time of birth, the gesture of Scorpio. These middle four months address themselves to inner-formation\u2014the torso.29. The nearness of the birth also brings with it the contention with the earth, with the will that is served by the limbs, with breathing, with the gradual introduction of nutrition and with digestion, with learning of sleepand changing states of consciousness, with the maturing of the warmthorganism. These processes ripen after birth with the formative gestures ofSagittarius , Capricorn , Aquarius, and Pisces . The last months of pregnancy and likewise the first months of life address themselves to the first calisthenics of the limbs and the metabolismin conjunction with earth forces. These characteristics of the twelve monthsof the year can serve as an orientation and help us get to know thepsychological mood of the mother and child during pregnancy. The organic contributions of the mother to the birth are the rhythmic muscle contractions, the intensity and characteristics of which changearound the time of the birth. Normally the first phase of the birth appears with the placement of the child's head at the opening to the birth canal from the cervix going inthe direction of the vagina. It is the expression of the child's will to set his/herself in contention with the earth. Again, the head pole, the nerve system,is the first. The individuality of the child, which is still living in theenveloping organs, begins to leave them in order to move into the organsof the body. The first step is the death of the amnion fluid when the amnioticsack breaks. The nerve-sense activity now begins to move into the head.The head searches for the way outside and, as a result, the child's foreheadcomes in contact with the mother's pelvic bone. At this moment, the child is in complete solitude and cannot be helped from the outside. The child must find the so-called hypomochlion,that is a search for balance between life in the womb, its past, and turningto the earth, its goal and future. Hypomochlion is also the name of thebalancing point on a scale. At the moment of birth, the gesture of the child's30.head is an exaggerated downward position of the chin in order to free the forehead so that the head can go upward: This is the first gesture of erectnessand verticality. The light of the world will be seen. After this first obstacle is overcome, the body is born, usually head first. Later, it will always be the limbs that carry out the will and leadmovement. After birth, the head attains a state of rest, places itself at thetop, in lightness. The child is taken into the mother's arms. In the second phase , the child begins to breathe and experiences a string of changes and maturations in the cardiovascular system. It beginsto draw upon the middle system of the new body. The umbilical cord nowstops pulsing, the placenta dies and is expelled. Hours after birth when the child has been diapered, has maybe already slept, the excretion of the meconium occurs. This is not yet a stool,but rather the demise of the yolk fluid contained in the intestine. In thethird phase of birth, the child has now begun to draw upon the digestive and metabolic system. With the first urination, one has the outer sign that the child, in a fourth phase, has stirred the organs of excretion and detoxification. The allantois now dies. The dead allantois remains as a holdover the organismas a fatty strand, the ligamentum paraumbilicale . Birth has four phases just like fertilization. The individuality gradually grasps the four functional main systems. And birth isaccompanied by the deaths of the four enveloping organs that will be leftbehind. Birth has a past (excretion of the amnion fluid, head movement, and maturation of the nerve system), a present (the first breath, changes in the heart and circulation, and the death of the placenta), and a future (excretion of the meconium and the metabolic system beginning to mature\u2014which will not be finished in a lifetime). And, as a remembrance of mortality,a \"poisonous sting,\" the ligamentum paraumbilicale remains in the organism after birth.31.The individuality no longer has a spherical organism in its surroundings. It now begins to have its own organism as its center that step by step is grasped and penetrated for at the least the next eighteen totwenty-one years. It is the task of adults to form and act as the newenveloping organs, to support the individuality within the surroundingsof its own body, and to help with the efforts to individualize the newbornorganism. There will still be many different births of the individuality andmany deaths of what was inherited in the further course of developmentthat should, from now on, be educationally and pedagogically accompanied.32.33.Early Childhood Today: Wish and Reality by Walter Riethm\u00fcller Waldorf Journal Project #2 Translated from the German by Nina Kuettel \"It seems essential to get a generalized picture of 'children'. . . but at the same time every generalization is far removed from that which children really 'are.' All generalizations about childhood manipulateeducation, but without them one cannot educate.\" This quote is fromeducation scientist J\u00fcrgen Oelkers. In contrast, Rudolf Steiner said, \"There is only one educator and that is the child-man and child-woman facing their own selves. Educationis the art of creating an opportunity for child-beings to educate themselves.\"With the first quote one experiences that the image adults make of the childis the basis, the foundation, of education. The arbitrariness of the qualityof that image is noticeable. The main point is that one has an image;however, in contrast, Steiner's comment is based on the idea that no imageat all should be made of a child, rather the concept of what childhoodactually is lives within this conflict.34. Perception of Childhood in Research The modern outlook towards the child has been essentially defined by the principle research done by Philipp Aries and Lloyd de Mause. In his fundamental work, Aries pointed out already in 1960 that the concept of\"childhood\" is a fabrication of the modern era. As a result, education as weknow it has been working its mischief more or less by robbing children oftheir freedom. It used to be that in traditional society a child was happy\"because he or she had the freedom to interact with many grades and agegroups.\" Therefore, \"at the beginning of our modern era a special conditionwas discovered; namely that of childhood. That led to a tyrannical concept of family that resulted in the destruction of friendship and sociability.\" 1 Lloyd de Mause describes the history of childhood as \"a nightmare fromwhich we are just now awaking. The further back we go in history, themore inadequate is the care of and provision for children and therefore thelarger was the probability that they would be killed, abandoned, beaten,tormented, and sexually abused.\" 2 Today, it seems, instead of waking up, society has sworn an oath of apocalypse against childhood. A sociological purvue of the situation ofchildren today (in Germany) with such known factors as the one-childfamily, one-parent family, and so forth, determines to a large degree thethinking about children. Some of the clich\u00e9s used to describe and evaluatethe current situation include destabilization (basic environment becomesfragile), equalization (social etiquette between adults and children isequalized), isolation (only-children), cloistered, institutional-ization,products of education, and media-influenced. The view that childhood isdisappearing is further supported by additional descriptive phrases suchas medicated, politicization, commercialization, and mechanization. Isolated voices have been raised in opposition including German educator Klaus Mollenhauer who noted,35.My anthropological imagination is not sufficient for me to envision a \"disappearance of childhood\"; that is, in the sense that there would be no marked differences in theeducational process between children and adults and alsono tasks specific to each to be mastered. I can onlyunderstand diffusions in this regard as social pathology. However, today one is again, or perhaps newly, eagerly prepared to conceive of childhood as a fabrication with the consequence that now children are to be treated as little adults, \"Since our children have beencompelled by conditions to become 'little adults,' we must now also treatthem as adults\" with the consequence that \"education...is not to promotechildhood, but to destroy it.\" 3 One can get away from the endless circle of scientific theories if one leaves behind the abstract idea of childhood andconcentrates on images of childhood or if one does empirical research. Images of the Child - the Example of Pippi Longstocking Since the time of Rousseau, age-appropriate education has become a leading concept in pedagogy. This requires a detailed, conclusively provable concept of development as a foundation. The necessary researchfor such a concept was done, especially in the first half of the twentiethcentury, through exact and detailed observation and analysis by such peopleas Sigmund Freud, W. Stern and Jean Piaget. Developmental psychologyresearched the thinking, feeling, and willing of children and produced avast amount of material on individual findings in which the individualchild was lost. A way out remains\u2014in the dire need for an explanation. One could cling to Rousseau's image of the original-natural state of the child possessing moral integrity. In our day, one likes to overlook thefact that, for instance, the \"Wild Child\" from Aveyron in his \"found state\"had none of the moral qualities, which he really should have possessed,according to this theory. Nowadays, people enthusiastically console36.themselves with a romanticized image of the child such as was portrayed by Astrid Lindgren in her story Pippi Longstocking. In Pippi Longstocking, the reflex against social conventions is clear. Customs are thrown overboard,paradoxes become real (a horse standing on the veranda), most secretdreams, such as throwing raw eggs, come true, and education is not leftout\u2014self-education, admittedly, within a reward-punishment scheme. Sendher to bed? \"I'll do that myself,\" says Pippi. \"First I'll say it very friendly,and when I don't mind, I'll say it again more sternly and when I still don'tmind then I get a spanking.\" It seems to me that this situation was not created from an intimate knowledge of the child's wish to fashion his or her pretend world afterreality. Rather, it seems that this situation is presented as a dreamed-up,radical answer to failed strategies of upbringing and education. Daily realityand the child's experience of the world are here lost. This does not helpclarify what a child really thinks, feels, and wills. Motifs of \"Happiness Education\" Moving closer to what a child thinks, feels, and wills, which guides the motifs of some educational methods, is easily stymied by what parents wish for their children. A traditional attitude involves many parents' dreamthat their offspring will have a more fulfilling life than their own. One canobserve how, with such an attitude, educational agendas fail and the bestof intentions does not lead to the desired outcome. Coerced happiness is adysfunctional agenda! All the same, one can be stimulated into thinking that happiness education works when good \"feelings\" arise as a result of Johann Pestalozzi and his relatively unsuccessful forays into \"happiness education.\" It soonbecomes clear that one is dealing here with a transitory feeling and not apermanent state of being. No one can be constantly and limitlessly happy.37.Likewise, what actually constitutes \"happiness\" must be determined by every person according to his or her own position and situation. This can easily be concluded from a survey of a large group of school children.4 A boy, ten years old, commented, \"I've been happy my whole life (to this point). Above all because I have good parents, grandparents,uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters, neighbors, friends, and a pet.\" Otherchildren of the same age see their happiness in nice friends, good grades,successful skating, or a new computer. One can get a more penetrating viewpoint with the question about the biggest possible experience of happiness. A schoolgirl answered, \"WhenI was little I wanted to learn to ride a bicycle. My father put me on the bikeand I rode off. He held onto the back of the bike. At a street that went alittle downhill, he let go and I rode along without knowing that he did.Suddenly my father yelled: 'You can do it!' Then I realized that I wasriding by myself. That was the happiest experience of my life.\" This answer begs our inquiry into the common characteristics of those things that can bring on moments of happiness. Aristotledifferentiated between luck, which came about by accident ( eutycheia ), and the feeling of happiness that appears by virtue of an activity, voluntarilydone, that makes one happy ( eudaimonia ). When we achieve capabilities through learning, then feelings of happiness are especially present. Current research has empirically corroborated this so-called activity- theoretical approach and has been able to elaborately specify that feelingsof happiness come about when \"for the mastery of a situation or the carryingout of an action, maximum capabilities are demanded.\" 5 This means when one can make maximum use of one's possibilities and capabilities insituations that justify the exertion. Substandard efforts such as when a chessplayer loses interest because he or she always wins easily, lead to loss ofmotivation just as demands for extraordinary effort, if over-challenging,can lead to frustration. 638.This kind of happiness allows the forgetting of \"time and space, delight and pain\" and leads to personality growth. Here one does not experience oneself as a passive observer but as an active co-creator of theworld. For children this comes especially into play when they can optimallybalance their will and their ability. They experience themselves as creativelyactive and so change the world and themselves. The task of education, then, is obvious\u2014creating opportunities for children to design and form their world and providing stimulus for theseactivities. To be avoided is passive entertainment that omits challengingactivity. From the Child's Point of View: a Paradigm of Early Childhood Research These considerations live within the central idea that guides modern methods of research on childhood and especially early childhood. Researchers abandon every limitation of perspective regarding a certainresearch goal. In the style of selfless observers, they unreservedly try to putthemselves into the child's world and experience. In this manner,empathizing, from quantifiable, measurable gauging of averages, whichcan then be translated into patterns, can finally be revived. The phrase \"froma child's point of view\" acquires meaning when one allows every person tohave her or his own blueprint for life by virtue of his or her own strengthsand his or her own, personal characteristics\u2014\"when one wants to seek outthe child, even the very young child, as an actor in its own development.\" 7 In this way, one may learn to understand developmental phases as an openprocess leading to new and even surprising individual patterns as childrenwrestle with outer conditions and propelling inner forces. Also, set aside isthe fallacy that the developmental process may be summed up as an exact,naturally pre-programmed succession of phases. Those working in Waldorfeducation like to habitually, and therefore more or less unconsciously, referto the seven-year rhythm. In other words,39.One must believe that something is possible which goes beyond what can be directly and immediately noticed orperceived. However, it seldom shows itself on its own.Usually one must be pushed to it. It is the other, unexpected,unknown and also impenetrable part of the subject that\"comes into the picture\" here, metaphorically speaking, hisshady side. 8 What we are dealing with here is the requirement that the \"permanent, individual blueprint of the child\" is perceived. Here the child becomes foreign to us, becomes a puzzle. At this point we remember Steinerand his counsel that we should not create an image of the child because aview of the individuality is lost if images become concrete. Today \"from the child's point of view\" means learn to understand the child from the beginning as a matchless individual. Learn to understanda child's behavior as questioning the world and the educator. In short,learn to let children express themselves. Approaches: Biographical Testimonials To get closer to the areas of perception and reality, children should finally have a word. It may be astonishing to some to try this at the preschool age and even with infants. The American early childhood researcher DanielN. Stern subtly, sensitively, and poetically ventured to feel himself into thestate of soul of infants of various ages during his exemplary research aboutten years ago. 9 Using Stern's work let us turn, first of all, to the time of infancy. Joey, six weeks old, has awakened. He looks randomly at a sunray dancingon the wall next to his crib. A space glows over there, A gentle magnet pulls to capture.The space is growing warmer and coming to life.40.Inside it, forces start to turn around one another in a slow dance. The dance comes closer and closer.Everything rises to meet it.It keeps coming. But it never arrives. The thrill ebbs away. 10 An image of moving forces, not coagulating into form or becoming solidified, an up and down, back and forth, no fixed point of reference,rising tension, falling tension\u2014the infant is enmeshed in a cohesion of pureforce-activities. A few weeks later this force-activity takes shape. Joey, at age 4.5 months, feels himself to be the cause of these processes but he cannot findthe right measure. For that he needs the loving tuning and rhythmiccomposition of this symphony of forces by his mother. Otherwise there isthe danger of becoming overwhelmed. I immerse myself into the world of her face. Its lines are like heaven, clouds and water.Its liveliness and verve are the air and light.Usually it's a turmoil of light and air.Today, everything here is still and dim.Neither the lines in her face nor its round bulges are stirring.Is she gone? Where did she go? I'm scared.Her complacency also slowly creeps into me.I look for something alive in her face in which I can take refuge.Now I've found it. It's her eyes. Her liveliness is concentrated there. It is the softest and, at the same time, the hardest place in this world. 11 The little boy is drawn into the \"world of the eyes\" where he experiences powerful currents that surge and tear and pull. He is able once again todelve into the world of the face, which is now variably shaped and toucheshim like a living, fresh breeze. Inside him the living dance begins anew.With mutual delight, a \"game of tag\" now begins which surrounds him41.and flows over him and in his alternating strains is like an experience of wind; if it becomes too pressing, the little boy turns away: I hesitate. Then I veer off. I turn my back to her wind. And I coast into quiet water, all alone.This quiet place quells the turmoil inside me. It dies down and comesto a rest. I am comforted.After a while in the stillness, a faint zephyr brushes the side of myhead. It refreshes me. I turn and see it gently ripple the water under a softer sky. 12 A new quality appears when the infant masters speech more and more. In doing so, the point at which what is spoken is no longer merely \"formulated\"but also targeted in reference to the self is of fundamental importance. 13 My room is so still I am all alone here. I want to go where Mommy and Daddy are. If I don't go, I will stay alone and still. So I go to their room, and get in between them, into thatvalley. There, I wrap myself in the heat that rises and falls. Iimmerse myself in the pools of warm smells, in the sounds of airflowing in and out of them as the valley fills and empties. I bathein the rich tides of our morning world. Then Daddy sends into my world a familiar sound\u2014just for me. Its music unlocks the warm Daddy-feeling. For the firsttime, I notice that the sound has a special shape, one that standsapart from its music. This shape is bright and soft and lingersafter the music is gone. It has a force and life of its own. It washiding in the flow of the music but has come out. I can play withthis brand-new shape. It has curves with little explosions. I try itand send it to Daddy. He sends it back to me, clean and sharp. Iam getting it now. I send it back. He laughs and sends it to meagain, this time flowing free and full. This new shape takes me into myself. There the shape unfolds by itself but also emerges from inside me. It grows andspreads. I let it fall over and around me. I press it close againstmy feelings. Now I'm ready. I rise up wrapped in my new shape.42.That bright, soft cloak changes me. I fling myself out of the valley and declare myself: \"Me pumpkin!\" From this simple example out of everyday life, one experiences exactly how the process of giving oneself up to something, in this case to language, with its entire musical-rhythmic melody, calls forth comfortingfeelings of life energy. In this realm, one can completely lose oneself, andthrough the lightning-like beaming in of forces related to coming toconsciousness, one experiences formation, limitation, and shape. This comescompletely from inside the small child. It is certainly stimulated by thefather in this case, but should be understood as a genuine achievement ofthe child. One senses that the child \"knows\" the word and is able to moldthese overwhelming forces. It is clear from these examples that the world experience of the small child is flexible. The child does not perceive the same reality as adults. Thechild is interwoven in a process in which the outer appearance of the worldis not taken in. Instead, shaping forces enter into conversation with the lifeenergies of the child. This \"conversation\" proceeds in an unstable mannerand is highly sensitive. It can get out of hand and become threatening.But, insofar as it is shaped and formed, it can become uplifting,strengthening, refreshing, and growth-stimulating. The child now requiresattentive perception of its sensations and orientations. The child needssupport and encouragement from adults. At the same time, the child alsorequires a caring, protective, and anchoring envelopment that conveyssecurity, safety, and composure. Further, the child needs stimulation tocontinually encourage a sailing forth to ever new shores. It is clear from the early childhood memories of Elias Canetti how profoundly early childhood experiences can affect the motifs of later life.The following episode must have happened when Canetti was two yearsold:43.My earliest memory is drenched in red. In the arms of a girl I come out of a door. The floor ahead of me is red and to the leftthere is a stairway going down which is also red. Opposite us atthe same level of height, a door opens and a smiling man stepsout and comes up to me in a friendly manner. He comes up veryclose to me, stands still and says to me: \"Show me yourtongue.\" I stick out my tongue; he puts his hand in his pocketand pulls out a pocket knife, opens it and puts the blade very close to my tongue. He says: \"Now we're going to cut out histongue.\" I can't bring myself to pull in my tongue. He comesever closer. Soon he will touch my tongue with the blade. Atthe last moment he pulls the knife away and says: \"Not today,tomorrow.\" He folds up the knife again and puts it in hispocket. Every morning we go out the door to the red floor, the door opens and the smiling man appears. I know what he isgoing to say and wait for his order to show my tongue. I knowhe wants to cut out my tongue and every time I am more fearful.That is how the day begins and it happens many times. 14 Later, in many conversations with his mother, the association is clarified, and the incident is clearly conceivable, but Canetti cannot let it go. It accompanies him during his entire life as a determining motive.Canetti saves his tongue: In spite of everything, he becomes an author. It isalso clear that for a child, reality is not the world of facts but rather what ishidden behind the facts and revealed in the soul. This reality is, first of all,bound up in the forces that form the feeling of mental/physical well-being.Then, they gradually work themselves up to the sphere of soul activity,thereby forming a basis of soul, a co-author of biographical motifs. Theresponsibility that educators have is paramount. It is especially evidentthat actions, facts, and writings about these matters are deeply and morallyperceived. From others' memories about childhood episodes it becomes more clear what the reality of the world is for the small child. It is molded out of44.moral substance. Truth is the educational resource. That is exactly the opposite of what Alice Miller decried: \"Education is, above all, the exerciseof power of the stronger adults over the weaker children. It is a compilationof deceitful maneuvers.\" However, this can only be an attitude of educationthat mistakes outer appearance for reality; that believes the wrapping to bethe actual core-being of the child\u2014in inheritance and environment, in genesand the ability to manipulate them. The essential being of the child is notto be found there. It hides itself from a constant, measuring gaze. Thisgaze is fixed and certain and does not have the openness to avoidpreconceived notions, even of the unexpected. With that kind of an attitude,how can an atmosphere be created where the small child has room todevelop its individuality? The attitude of the older generation regardingthe younger generation should be one of acceptance and pleasant surprise,as formulated by Erik Erikson, and not one of critical observation. Therefore, for the task of education, qualities are needed in which the individuality does not see itself as being hindered by its so-calledwrappings. Steiner impressively summed up these considerations: \"Theessence of the child . . . we cannot even get to know with our normalunderstanding. We can't even comprehend it. But, we can support itthrough attention, discretion, and devotion.\"45.Footnotes: 1 \"The society of the Middle Ages , which we have chosen here as a starting point, had no relationship to childhood.... An understanding of childhood is not to be confused with a fondness for the child; itcorresponds much more to a conscious perception of distinctionsbetween children and adults, even categorically differentiating youthfrom adults. Such a conscious relationship to childhood did notpreviously exist.\" Philipp Aries, 1975. the Children Crying: The Psychogenetic History of Childhood ), 1977. 3 Already in 1985 the educator, H.

A colleague at the East European Institute in Munich,Germany, he spent one year at the Waldorf Teacher's Training Seminar inStuttgart, Germany. Starting in 1978 he was a class teacher in Freiburg at St.Georgen and after that in Stuttgart at Kr\u00e4herwald. Since 1990 he has beena lecturer at the Freien Hochschule/Seminar for Waldorf Education inStuttgart. He and his wife have two children.47.The Kindergarten Child by Peter Lang Waldorf Journal Project #2 Erziehungskunst H.9, 2002 Translated from the German by Nina Kuettel The kindergarten has come into the public arena. In the political debate about the consequences of the conclusions of the PISA study, the kindergarten is, in many cases, not understood as a place of developmentin which children acquire essential, vital, basic skills needed in order tohave a foundation on which to build future school learning. Time spent inkindergarten is often characterized as \"cuddly education\" and \"wastedtime.\" According to a series of articles about the new education catastrophein Germany in Der Spiegel (a German weekly news magazine), the dogmaremains that kindergarten can only be playing and no learning and, as aresult, there is cultural malnutrition. Logically, the call for beginning schoolearlier is becoming louder. However, logical does not always meanappropriate or just. As a result, it is more urgent than ever that, in the immediate future, the developmental needs of young children are highlighted and examinedto see what requisites for kindergarten education emerge. As the same time48.it can be shown that in Waldorf education, kindergarten is a time of thorough preparation for future learning in school and in life. Children are individuals who develop and, with their talents, inclinations, interests, and also handicaps, want to go their own ways. Inorder to facilitate this process in the best possible way, they need competent,adult role models, loving and secure relationships, and their own scheduleof development. Children don't fit into the timetables of the adult worldnor do they fit into purposeful political or economic agendas. Children are capable of learning, joyful at learning, and ready to learn. Their developmental windows are wide open, especially in thepreschool and first school years. That is where the responsibility arises toshape the child's world in such a way that at least these three maincomponents permeate their upbringing: 1. Comprehension : Children should and want to know and learn to understand the world in its interconnectedness; therefore, the methodology here should consist of simple and easily graspedassociations that lead into the ever more complex. 2. Application: Children gain trust in their own growing powers and abilities primarily when they get many opportunities to do thingsthemselves and master tasks themselves. When help is needed, it should,of course, be forthcoming. 3. Meaningfulness: Children should develop a sense of meaning in their own actions, feelings, and thoughts step by step. That requires qualifiedrole mo dels in childhood and youth as an orientation and accompaniment on their path.49.Until school-readiness (determined by the physical and mental development of the child and not necessarily in step with legal regulations or economic considerations) it is not specific, testable knowledge that thechild needs. Quite the opposite is true! The time before school, free fromformal learning, allows for the development of basic skills on which laterformal education and training can build. These skills provide for the futureyouth and adult to arrive into a position where he can master the demandsof daily life in the best possible way. They are the requisite foundations forfurther specialization. Before school readiness, children neither need nordo they tolerate any one-sided intellectualization. The same goes for \"cuddlyeducation.\" Children need mindful attendance of parents and well-trainededucators to give them orientation. Only in this way can they find theirown paths. Waldorf Kindergartens as Skills Centers Waldorf kindergartens have always been understood to be not just safe havens: They are intended to better the developmental conditions of each child and afford him or her a happy and learning-intensive childhood.In Waldorf pedagogy, there are seven skills areas that are highlighted forchildren up to age six or seven: Body and Movement Scientists and teachers have established that more than half of all first-graders have problems with posture, with overweight, or with balance. Many children suffer from lack of movement; their motor and fine motorskills are insufficiently developed. But the human being's mental andspiritual orientation and balance corresponds to his physical flexibility andmobility. Whoever cannot maintain his physical balance usually hasproblems with his mental balance. Also, the ability to move definitelyinfluences acquiring speech. The ability to comprehend something and then50.go towards it permeates perception, widens the horizon of a child's experience, and activates the speech development process. Children wholearn active, versatile movement are also preparing the way to more skillfulthinking. That is why special attention is paid to make sure children getmuch varied physical movement. Regular walks, games, or gardening alsobelong in this spectrum of movement as do finger games and handwork(such as sewing or embroidery). Tips on method: Perception of the body, development of bodily sense of self, and the motor and fine motor skills come about, for example, by walking, climbing, and jumping rope, gardening and kitchen work, by playing simplemusical instruments, and doing simple woodwork such as building abirdhouse. The Senses and Perception Virtual worlds are becoming epidemic. They dangle qualities before us that never occur in reality. In order to not fall for these deceptive images, we must depend on our senses more than ever. We need an elevatedperception skill. Our children require an alert consciousness for all thathappens around them and to them. What develops is the trust in one's ownpower of perception. That is why dependable, unadulterated impressionsare especially important in current times. Even media skills, which aredesirable later, here go through a pedagogical foundation building. \"Mediaskill,\" according to Joseph Weizenbaum, an American computer expert atM.I.T., \"means the ability to think critically. One learns critical thinkingalone through critically processed reading and that is conditional on a highlevel of speech competence.\" Therefore, in the Waldorf kindergarten, children first discover and explore the real world with their senses and thereby get to know and learnto understand simple, perceptible connections. In this way, paired with their51.own joy of discovery, they also gradually experience elementary laws of nature. Such fundamental requisites as these should be present, at the least,before children enter into more complicated connections. Therefore,computers or television in kindergarten can in no way promote media skillsneeded later. Tips on method: Nurture the human senses by creating harmonious rooms, among other things, with soothing blends of colors and materials, and by utilizing healthy, organic foods and natural materials. Speech Thinking and speaking are closely connected. We can express what we are thinking through speech. With speech we can express our feelings, give names to all things in the world, and enter into discussions with oneanother. However, this instrument requires early, active, and carefulnurturing. Children learn to speak in a speaking environment. This depends,first of all, upon the personal relationship between those speaking and thoselistening. If a child perceives warmth of soul and language from the adults,then this is how the child can develop good, clear speech. When a childbegins to speak varies according to the individual. But all children needgood speech role models in order to grow in their language. Songs, stories, verses, finger games, and rhymes have an important place in a Waldorf kindergarten. The children playfully learn the languageand become at home in it. The speech of the educator should therefore beloving, clear, imaginative, and age appropriate. Baby talk does not have aplace here nor the use of abstract explanations. Tips on method: Good speech role models, clear, vocabulary-rich and imaginative speech, songs, verses, finger games, rhymes, correct naming of things such as plants and animals, daily storytelling or reading from52.meaningful stories, fairytales, and so forth, allow the children to speak out. Take time to listen and do not correct their speech. From these activities,joy for reading and reading ability will emerge. Imagination and Creativity The paradox is omnipresent. All around us, more and more things are being standardized, prefabricated, and defined. On the other hand, human social development is unthinkable without imagination andcreativity. Will we soon even still be capable of those two qualities? Howdo we acquire and maintain these skills? A wealth of ideas, mental/spiritualflexibility, and imagination are required of adults (and rightly so) to enablethem to shape their lives and work, and kindergarten is the time to investin the development of these faculties. Everything imaginative, everythingartistic, vitalizes and expands the soul and consciousness of human beings.Development and care of childhood imagination takes on concrete form inthe Waldorf kindergarten. There are many non-standardized and barely\"finished\" toys that stimulate children's creative powers. Stories animatethe children to translate what they hear into play. Daily playtime is ampleenough for the children to be concentrated and spur each other on to findingjoy in activities. Tips on method: Use toys and play materials that stimulate the imagination, i.e. rocks, boards, pieces of wood, large pieces of cloth and scarves. Have regular playtimes in the forest or garden, with variations in games such asrole playing and puppet plays. Use some guided play, such as pretendingto be shoemakers, carpenters or tailors (the archetypal trades). Thearchetypal trade stories should be made known and a relationshipdeveloped to them through play; tell inspiring and motivating stories thatcan then be translated into the children's play.53.Social Ability Social cohesiveness must be learned. Without social competence, the healthy life of an individual person and a society is inconceivable. Children are social beings from birth and will studiously acclimatethemselves to social relationships. These learning processes begin in thefamily and continue in the kindergarten. As more and more children aregrowing up in one-child families, often with only one parent, and as a result,their social field of practice is limited, then kindergarten must now, morethan ever, become the basis for social experience. Social affiliation is alwaysabout bringing the interests, desires, and needs of the individual into arelationship with the group or community. On the one hand, individualsmust be able to bring their abilities and intentions and, on the other hand,the needs of everyone else should have a place. For this, rules, agreements,and trust are necessary. Children need communities in which they can orientthemselves and learn as many of these social rules of life as possible. A Waldorf kindergarten is such an environment. The children learn that there are rules as well as a structure-creating rhythm to the day andweek that lead to single children or groups taking over certain tasks (suchas tidying up or setting the table). The children orient themselves byimitating the teacher. Through this process, they also learn to takeresponsibility and use their own creative space that has resulted and, at thesame time, they get practice in useful activities. Tips on method: Help each other within mixed-age groups; take over tasks such as rinsing the dishes, tidying the room, watering the plants; social orientation through listening to meaningful stories, role playing like father-mother-child, fire-fighting, hospital, store; learn to give, receive, and share;experience parents helping in the kindergarten, for example, by repairingtoys, festivals, or renovation work; practice solving conflict, for example,by apologizing.54.Motivation and Concentration Today many children, youth, and adults suffer from nervousness, hyperactivity, and a lack of concentration. Their enthusiasm has been limited as well as their ability to connect themselves with certain activities for agiven period of time. In science and education, the causative factors(pathogenesis) have long been sought and researched. At the same time,there has been an effort to get to know and strengthen the healthy andstabilizing factors (salutogenesis). The Waldorf teachers' tasks are to identify habits and impressions that are harmful to the development of the small child and to keep themaway from the child (for example, television at an early age). At the sametime, their educational efforts are directed toward health-promoting factors.For instance, they recognize the desire for learning and activity of the youngchild and stimulate that desire through role modeling and the child's naturaltendency to imitate. Interesting and stimulating possibilities for activityhave a motivating effect on the children. So regular repetition and rhythmic,creative elements in the daily kindergarten routine, as well as regularattention to seasonal changes highlighted with festivals, all help the childto develop the ability to concentrate. Tips on method: Self-created play; toys that stimulate initiative and offer manifold possibilities for play; get to know complete tasks from beginning to end and try for themselves (for example, baking, laundry, and gardening);stimulation created by the interest of the teacher; experience appropriateactivities having to do with adult daily life instead of unplanned, senseless,or unhealthy activities. Ethics and Moral Values In order to shape their own lives, children, like adults, need mental/ spiritual orientation, values, and tasks with which they can internally55.connect. Children need rules, rituals, clarity, and truthfulness. They want to experience adults who are engaged and involved and can give themmoral orientation without preaching. However, today many children findonly the standards of a fun-and-recreation-oriented society in theirsurroundings without any supporting commitment. Waldorf pedagogy consciously incorporates ethics and morals into its educational concept. It recognizes that children need a coordinatedsystem to absorb the good, beautiful, and true just as they need respect forother people, other cultures, and creation. Children must also learn thatthe experience of respect, beauty, and truth is linked to personal engagementand involvement. Tips on method: Orientating stories; preparation and celebration of festivals; loving contact with nature; practiced charity and loving thy neighbor, gratitude (verse before meals), and helpfulness; experience parents'involvement in clubs, politics, the kindergarten; learn respect for multi-cultural distinctions; hear and sing songs and verses from other cultures.56.57.Creating a Meadow for Childhood Education for a New Millennium What do Young Children Need Today? by Sally Schweizer Waldorf Journal Project #2 Steiner Education , Vol. 34, No. 2 A five year-old on parental knee with opened book: \"Wait, I haven't seen the picture properly.\"1 Another child of the same age is alone in front of a video and, as thepictures race by, accepts the situation silently, passively. Example and Love Love and good example are the greatest tools we have as parents and early years' educators. The young child is defenseless, trusting, withoutjudgment or discrimination. Yet this is the time of greatest learning. Bythree the child has learned the particularly human qualities of walking,talking, and first thinking, and taken the first step in consciousness. \"I'mtaller than my neck,\" a three-year-old was heard to say.58.What do we offer the child under seven to learn when he can absorb so much so fast? The delicate sense organs are all-embracing; the child absorbs willy-nilly the world around, recreating it through the divine giftof imitation in play, speech, and behavior. Many children today have had to close themselves off from a world with which they cannot cope by forming a hard, protective shell around their souls. One sees pale, defined faces, almost lumpy. Gone are many true children's faces, soft, round, and rosy with bright eyes shining into the world. Why? What is lacking (or too pervasive) that this has become so? Children in all strata of society are at risk: poverty and discrimination as well as affluence and over-stimulation create an environment in whichchildren cannot thrive. Urban living exacerbates the effects. All parts of their development are attacked by the harmful influences and images around them. Many children are drowning in a bog of commercialism andmedia. Speed and greed rule. Uncertainty and confusion abound. One blinksand it's all changed, accelerating so fast that we are left gasping. Too much,too often, too early\u2014strength is sapped. Do we uphold the need for a proper childhood? Or do we dress children as little adults and plunge them into the realms of adult emotionsand intellect in the hope that they will become clever and knowledgeableas early as possible? To what detriment? Research finds that those givenearly schooling do no better than those starting later. Does entrance into an early childhood curriculum lead them to access information they really need, or would their needs best met by providing a stimulating wholesomeenvironment? Children are our future. How can we help them to face theworld today? Moral Life Every child has an individual spiritual nature as well as an earthly one; it is up to us to nourish both. Then s/he will be able to stand in the world with courage and responsibility. Working with festivals has a healingquality and deepens children's moral understanding. It helps counteract59.the breakdown of traditions and out-of-season peculiarities (e.g., strawberries in winter at the supermarket). Festivals cover every aspect oflearning with their preparation and celebration, bringing a magical depth of spiritual and soul experience to both child and parent alike, and adds healing to our world of untruths, cons, and hype. A foundation is laid tohelp the child withstand later pressures of prestige and temptations suchas drugs, smoking, and alcohol. The Waldorf school's daily rituals such asthe nondenominational verse and candle lighting at break give the children a sense of occasion and continuity. Celebrating each child's birthday kindles self-respect. Religious feeling is at the heart of the 0-7-year-old's learning. I am not, of course, linking this with any form of creed or organized religion.Wonder is the basis of their search for knowledge. This quality is disappearing, often replaced by only factual and even useless information, and yet wonder is also vital to the adult. As a six-year-old said, \"Heaven ismore higher than space.\" The true scientist must, next to clear analysis,also be a creative wonderer with reverence for life. We must not be gulledinto answering all the children's questions! but can be silent and leave space for their own answers, as, for instance with the seven year-old who said: \"How magic?\" Precocious, hardened children become softened and their senses are opened through our education. We care for the room and garden. Evensawdust goes on the compost heap, as well as apple maggots to finish eating, and we rescue lost worms for the flower bed. Listen to this: four-to-six- year-olds weeding around the bonfire, finding worms: \"There are three under here.\" \"This one is so fat, he's eaten a lot of bonfire.\"\"This one is so small, it was only born last week.\"\"This one was only born this morning.\"\"This tiny one just now while we were having break!\"\"I'm going to make a bed under that bush for this one.\" What a wealth of \"Desirable Outcomes\" 2\u2014all at once!60.We care not to waste anything, even water; the future of the planet is at stake, but it is also a picture of caring for each other. We collect just four or five frogs' eggs, wait for their metamorphosis and carry the tiny frogs back to the pond. The Waldorf approach is very practical\u2014out of life and living itself, and relevant to everything the child should be learning at this age. The child needs this living integral experience to accumulateknowledge, for s/he lives in the moment. In winter a candle or two illuminethe room instead of electricity\u2014this is both cozy and real. Home Life A six-year-old: \"I've got to go to afternoon care because it's booked and paid for.\" A five-year-old in afternoon care: \"Mummy and Daddy aren't working! They're always going in bed.\" Many children suffer from the breakdown of family life and the vanishing of the extended family. Their parents love them but are stressed; television and computer may replace their care. When a mother returns towork soon after the baby's birth, the child feels lost, however loving thecaregivers are. Single parents struggle to cope on their own; in many familiesboth parents are working and do not have enough time for their children.Routines are haphazard. In today's hustle and bustle many are not allowedthe time to recover properly from illness. Violence, neglect and abuse areincreasing. Domestic work may be replaced by appliances, and meals arenot taken together, often merely hurried affairs in the microwave. In the kindergarten we work closely with parents and caregivers, inviting them to experience a morning, our festivals, and regular eveningsas a group when we share developmental aspects of childhood: helpingand supporting each other. We visit the children at home, not to pry but tostrengthen trust and gain insight into the children's needs. Parents oftenneed and ask for help.61.Social Life We share a nutritious break mid-morning, prepared with the children, beginning with a grace and ending with thanks. They help of their own accord with the cooking or spreading, baking or chopping,serving, laying tables, and washing up. It is a social occasion as well as anourishing one. A single apple or apricot brought by a child for me is alwaysshared between us all. What a wonder! There are other domestic activitiesfor them to do such as polishing, sweeping, mending (vital to counteractthe throw-away mentality but also to give a picture of caring), crafts,washing napkins, woodwork, sewing and gardening. They become deftand able, all this activity in support of later thinking capacity. A new Israeli four year-old to mother (in Hebrew):\"Why don't Jane and Sarah understand when I speak?\"\"Sally doesn't either.\"\"Yes, she does, she understands everything.\"(\u2014actually very little! but gestures speak louder than words!) Communication has increased, yet racism, ethnic cleansing, violence and war thrive. What a paradox! Increased loneliness brings new problems. Children need to be shown love and compassion, and then they will copyit. Christmas and Whitsun are particularly relevant times for giving a senseof inclusiveness, celebrating the diverse nature of humanity with songs inother languages; but it can happen on a daily basis as well. For example, Ilearn a song in many languages and there are red, brown, black, and yellowdolls as well as white. \"All right, you can come in our game,\" said a six year-old, \"but you are allowed not to play if you want(!)\"62.Children are egoistic but have a growing sense of sociability particularly when six years old; because they are under no schooling pressure, they have space for love to help the younger children and organizeeach other! Their emotions are gently stimulated through love, music, color,and warmth. The images created through the repeated telling of a naturestory or fairy tale support the moral and emotional life. Sometimes oneneeds to show beautiful illustrations as well, to counteract the ugly,frightening images many children carry, absorbed from the media, and soforth. Modern Life Technology has brought us many wonderful things; yet along with its advances we need human qualities and especially human warmth. This is most relevant for the child under seven. Our environment is less and lesschild-friendly. Children are adaptable and resilient but this comes at a costbecause they become stressed in their souls. Their delicate nerve-sensesystems may be flooded with impressions through harsh colors, news,image-covered clothing, traffic, background music, advertisements, storytapes, electronic sounds, poor and ugly (often too many) toys and books.Barbie, Aliens, Bugs, Transformers, and so forth, leave precious little roomfor fantasy. Are Disneyland, Toy Story, and so forth, \"treats?\" Do processedfoods, pollution, and the excessive and often unnecessary use ofimmunization and antibiotics undermine their health and weaken theirimmune systems? Computer games can give the child an experience of aseries of violent images with neither context nor resolution, leading toconfusion and resulting in fear. Children cannot cope and lapse into lethargy,poor concentration or bad behavior. Some are stimulated to early sexualawakenings. \"Bored\" children are actually simply so over-saturated thatthey cannot absorb any more. Poor sleep may be caused by exhaustionfrom too many sensations and the absence of any quiet space. Mystery and63.wonder are frequently distorted. One even intrudes into the life of the unborn child with prenatal education resulting in unknown consequences.Much of the growth of these phenomena is new since my own childhood.Not that there is anything wrong with electricity or machines! But whereand when is the right or wrong place or time? The child-under-seven'sconsciousness does not separate him from the world; he lives in completesympathy with it, as the following demonstrate. A five-year-old, about a dream: \"But you know, you were in it.\" A four-year-old: a real rabbit.\" eurythmy performance:\"Are they puppets?\" Children catapulted into workbooks, tests and computers are torn away from their real world and forced into a foreign one. This, togetherwith a stressful environment can have harmful consequences. This is atragedy. For the older a child is, the harder it is to put things right. Worsestill, so often this environment is seen as beneficial, and certainly \"normal.\"The good guys and bad guys are often portrayed in equal measure by uglycharacters. A website for 2-12-year-olds \"protects them from unsuitablematerial on the Internet,\" but gives them access to a cold intellectual mediumdevoid of the wonder intrinsic to their being and still provides questionablematerial. \"Action toys\" turn children into passive players. They \"soak up\"these characters and imitate their behavior, speech, and movement. Thebright ideas of the commercial world to rake in money render the childrenas pawns in their games. One disrespects children in a mistaken assumptionthat they need to be entertained. Many media images of \"beauty,\"\"strength,\" and \"desirability\" can lead to anorexia, inadequacy and violence.The same can be said of many toys.64.Rhythmic Life There are many damaged children today who find it a relief to come to the Kindergarten. The rhythmic structuring of the day, week, month, and season helps to stabilize uncertainties and lack of boundaries. Children'snatural activity finds many harmonious, constructive, and strengtheningoutlets. The teacher consciously creates a balance between play and rest,\"chaos\" and calm, noise and quiet, group and individual activity, humorand seriousness, being inside and outside. How they love fun and laughter.Some arrive pale and go home rosy; some begin to sleep better. Rhythmsalso bring about good habits. \"Where are the toys?\" children sometimes ask at interview. Day 1: Story.Day 2: \"Oh, not that story again!\"Day 3: Story, child silent.Day 4: \"Can we have that story again?\" This is a recurring incidence with new children. Children soon warm to unformed playthings of natural materials, just as to the daily repetition of a story. Especially today, the child's innerneed for \"again!\" must be satisfied. We have bricks and logs which in thechild's mind can be ships, mobile phones, cheese, fences, or . . . logs. Softdolls with only an indication of a face are not confined to one emotion.Clothes' horses, planks, and cloths may make dog kennels, castles, shops,kitchens, spaceships, houses. Shells, bark, and pine cones form patterns,money, food, plates . . . Their creativity knows no bounds. We give them the space and time for unguided play. Goals are their own, not ours. Time flows on; the chimesare the rhythms: waxing and waning, ebbing and flowing. Tidy-up time65.begins when I take a cloth and fold it; nothing disturbs their concentrated activity: they gradually notice and follow suit. Thinking and Consciousness Two six-year-olds in conversation: \"Let's finish the house now.\"\"But it's time to tidy up.\"\"Then, why did you spend all that time playing? If you hadn't spentall that time playing, we could have built the house.\" A five-year-old: \"I don't want to play; I'm doing a puppet show.\" What is play? What is not? In this active dream world they lay the foundations of clear philosophical thinking. They find solutions to problems and help each other. Arguments are sorted out amicably, often only throughmy walking nearby or watching from a distance, inwardly supporting butleaving them free. Alongside mathematics and language, physical andimaginative development are fostered. Warm and peaceful simplicity inwhich they can flourish surrounds them: plain colored cloths and gifts ofnature in ordered baskets, a few beautiful pictures. Patterns and rhythmshold them. They enjoy beeswax modeling, watercolor painting, lyre playing,beeswax crayon drawing, song, poetry and dance. How can we expect them to work with the 3Rs and testing when they are still at the following stage of consciousness. Five-year-old: \"Did you build this school?\" Another, the same age: \"Sally, who are you going to marry when you grow up?\"66.Every child will play with ready-made games, but the depth of learning is not equal to that of games created by themselves, nor of self- motivated activities: \"I can do it by myself on my own,\" asserted a 3 12- year-old, sharing out spoons at break. Learning in Waldorf kindergartensis integrated, not compartmentalized. Each of our activities covers most, if not all Early Learning Goals. 3 Children grow at their own individual pace. As their thinking and judgment are in seed-form, we take care not to overburden it, rather concentrating on their innate \"busy-ness.\" Forcing the intellect at this age is to the detriment of other faculties. Making choices and decisions throws them back on themselves prematurely. They can do itbut at a cost. We are gentle with awakening self-consciousness. \"My voicesounds different from everyone else's!\" mused a nearly six-year-old. WhenI do plays with the children, I put out on stands several costumes for each character. Maybe one day we'll have four Snow Whites, and the next day, five. This not only precludes disappointment, it suits their stage ofconsciousness. While they are still one with the world till 6 or 7, we believeit is not appropriate to make them self-aware or give feelings of pride, guiltor competition. For this reason also we do not display their work, which is quickly forgotten anyway. The importance of the \"result\" begins only after kindergarten. All this provides a firm basis for enthusiasm and joy inlearning. Movement Every Tuesday I take the children on an expedition. Well-equipped, with a freshly prepared picnic of muesli and a thermos of herb tea, we set off\u2014to fields, woods, stream, mud, sun, frost, rain, fallen branches, bramblytunnels, older children building huts, story, magic, joy, and mystery awaitus. We go where the mood takes us. I would do it in a town park or grassy space too! This feeds their senses and understanding of the world around, while strengthening courage and stamina. Many children's movement istoo restricted today by over-use of \"convenient\" baby slings, seats, andbuggies (the head hanging sideways and the back crooked with limbs67.wedged in), little play outside, much car travel. Physical development under seven years is the basis for intellectual and emotional development, andwe place great emphasis on free movement, self initiated and imitative, not directed. What about television and the \"mouse?\" What does it really signify when the child's report says he has \"poor mouse control?\" We prepare anendless stream of gestures in songs and poems for imitation in circle time 4 and eurythmy. Children also need to explore and take normal risks. Future The modem child needs to develop courage, self-discipline and powers of discrimination to meet the growing problems of the world. Increasing violence, ethical issues, such as gene manipulation, declininghealth of the planet, a nightmarish number of options, increasing invasion of privacy, untruths in adverts. . . . And yet many are born now with particular qualities of sociability and initiative to care for others and for theearth. Children need to learn adaptability and compassion and to developintuition through being given a proper childhood with a secure foundation,enough time for truly creative play, artistic work and humor. The real magic and wonder of childhood will help them to become inwardly free. We hold the children close in our thoughts; this is part of our work. We must havethe imagination and courage to be ourselves and to teach from the heart aswell as the head. Education becomes alive and is true for the children whenthe teachers do what they believe in; they should not teach just what they are supposed to. They must eradicate personal stress and not be bound by fear. They must be full of joy and initiative\u2014the children will imitate it!One must find the balance between protection and freedom: create a\"meadow\" in which children can freely exercise their boundless creativity.And some final food for thought: A girl of six in my class to her parents: \"Do you know why I'm gooder in the Kindergarten than at home? It's because there's magicthere.\"68. Footnotes: 1. The anecdotes quoted are from children in my kindergarten. For some of these I am indebted to parents. 2.

Yetwe have only recently begun to pay serious attention to thesignificance of children's emotions. \u2014 Dr. Judy Dunn In this article I will explore a vital area of early years learning wherein experientially informed theoretical thinking and empirical research, in the broad field of psychology (including psychoanalysis), cohere with Waldorfeducational philosophy. It seems to me that the ever-escalating malaisewithin public education and parents' and professionals' ever-increasingdisquiet with those trends offer the Waldorf movement an opportunity notto be missed. It is a chance to take our work and values out into the public70.sphere, which is crying out for a humane and demonstrably effective alternative to the assessment-obsessed, anxiety-driven fare on offer throughpublic education. One way of doing this is to write to the press wheneverwe see an opportunity, to challenge current conventional wisdom and setout the Waldorf alternative. 1 Another valuable approach is to draw upon the wealth of substantive literature in a range of fields broadly centered inthe psychology discipline in order to vindicate the assumptions thatunderpin Waldorf praxis. It is this latter approach that I will pursue in thisarticle. I write as a professional counselor and psychotherapist with over ten years' standing, and as a trained Waldorf teacher with several years'experience leading a Waldorf Parent and Toddler group. As a counselor Iam particularly interested in the emotional aspects of human experienceand learning. My attention is here because, as Dan Goleman puts it in hisimportant book Emotional Intelligence , our \"fundamental ethical stances in life stem from underlying emotional capacities,\" 2 and \"emotional [competence] goes hand in hand with education for character, for moraldevelopment, and for citizenship\" 3 Certainly, the emotional level of experience is being criminally neglected in the current British government'ssingle-minded obsession with unbalanced and developmentally inappropriate cognitive-intellectual learning at ever-earlier ages. Yet asSusanne Denham has written, young children \"are more emotionallysophisticated than we ever previously imagined\" and \"if emotionalcompetence is so very important, it behooves educators . . . to understandwhat is really going on in the young child's emotional world\" 4 Let us consider several interrelated issues. First, the proper role of play in early learning and the dangers of distorting or subverting its natural expression through adult-centric intrusion; Second, the distorting effects of anxiety on healthy learning; and71. Third, the developmental dangers entailed in premature or \"precocious\" intellectual or ego development. In future writings I wish to explore a range of other emotion-related issues. These include the nature and quality of \"relationship\" in early years environments, and its longer-term consequences for healthy learning andrelational intersubjectivity; and the centrality of \"emotional intelligence\"in healthy child development. The place of play in early development Play cannot be pinned down, and turned into a product of measurable learning. This is because play is a process, [that] enables a holistic kind of learning, ratherthan fragmented learning. \u2014 Professor Tina Bruce If we try to cramp and control him by our own notions of what he ought to be, we may close up the verychannels that will bring him value and safety. \u2014 Susan Isaacs, Social Development in Young Children The issue of play and its place in early years learning environments has had a particular prominence in recent times. Early years professionals were truly horrified when, in 1999, the British government's initial draftproposals for early learning goals failed to mention the role of play.Following a public outcry at this omission, the government's revisedguidelines invented the notion of so-called \"structured play,\" being anattempt to preserve the intrusively prescriptive approach to early yearseducation while paying lip service to those championing the central role ofplay (such as the Waldorf movement and the interest group called \"Let theChildren Play\"). While invoking the notion of structured play, thegovernment glaringly revealed its limited understanding of the place of72.play in early child development. Nonetheless, its proposals were welcomed in the Times Educational Supplement.5 Below are excerpts from a rejected letter I submitted in response. The Times Educational Supplement's unreservedly positive reporting of the government's revised guidelines for early years learning . . . wholly embraced the assumedbeneficence of the new guidelines; and anyone uninitiatedin these debates would gain the strong impression from yourreport that the government has shifted considerably on theissue of play in early learning, and that its revised proposalsare universally welcomed in the early years sphere. Ifanything, however, the new proposals are even moredangerous than the original ones, in that at least the latterdidn't pretend to be what they weren't . . . You state [of the new guidelines] seemsto be the idea of structured and focused play.\" Yet the notionof structured play is a fundamentally incoherent, self-contradictory concept. My dictionary defines play as\"freedom of movement, space for this . . . , especially asspontaneous activity of children.\" as an assessment-obsessed, objectifying educational gaze oversees andintrudes into the young child's world, the child's activitynecessarily and by definition ceases to constitute play. Thegovernment's terminological sleight of hand could easilydistract attention from its unchanged prescriptive agenda,and must not be allowed to slip through without challenge. It is . . . difficult to overestimate the damage that will result from the premature intellectualization of thechild's early years\u2014as Rudolf Steiner pointed out some 80years ago. These fundamentally misguided early yearspolicies are likely to keep an army of counselors andpsychotherapists in work for decades to come! What follows are citations from some literature on play from authoritative non-Waldorf sources in the broad field of psychology that thoroughly support the approach to play advocated by Waldorf educationalphilosophy.73.The distinguished early child psychologist and psychoanalyst Susan Isaacs has penetrating things to say about the crucial foundational importance of play. For Isaac, the child's imaginative play is a starting pointfor building a necessary foundation, not only for cognitive developmentbut also for the adaptive and creative intention that, when fully developed,marks out the artist, the novelist, the poet. In his make-believe, Isaacscontinues, the child takes the first steps towards that emancipation ofmeanings from the here and now of a concrete situation. This makes possible hypotheses and the \"as if\" consciousness, \" It is exceedingly difficult to imagine how anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of the young child'sarchetypally momentous yet infinitely delicate developmental process could seekto impose a distorting, agenda upon it \u2014a highly complex process in which the child is freely and imaginatively re-creating selectively those elements in past situations that can embody his emotional or intellectual need of thepresent, [as] he adapts the details moment by moment to the presentsituation\" 6 (Susan Isaacs' emphasis). Several years later, Isaacs wrote that the lessening of inner tension and anxiety resulting from free dramatic play \"makes it easier for the childto control his real behavior . . . , helps to free the child from his first personal schemas, and to enhance his readiness to understand the objective physicalworld for its own sake.\" 7 And in a magnificent section in her Social Development of Young Children , Isaacs offers us a perspective on play in the early years that should be compulsory reading for all professionals andeducation policy-makers. I quote selectively from it to give the reader aflavor of the Waldorf-affirming wisdom it contains. Play . . . is supremely the activity that brings [the child] psychic equilibrium in the early years. In his play activities, the child externalizes and works out to somemeasure of harmony all the different trends of his internalpsychic life . . . through his own wishes and impulses . . .74.Play is indeed the breath of life to the child, since it is through play activities that he . . . can work upon his wishes,fears, and fantasies, so as to integrate them into a livingpersonality. . . . [The] passive work of the educator inleaving the child free to make-believe is as valuable a partof his function as his more active services\u2014a pointsometimes lost sight of in the modem nursery school [Thechild's] indirect expression of unconscious fantasy . . . cannever appear at the behest of the super-ego [i.e. via externaldidactic instruction\u2014RH]. It is always the fruit of the child's own creative wishes. If we attempt to control and contain it, wesimply make it lifeless and formal. [H]ere . . . the educator . merely supporting. . The inner . . . is beyond ourpower to affect and control by any deliberate act. . . . [Wecannot] determine the lines upon which his individualityshall develop, and what his actual solution of conflict shallbe. The more clearly we ourselves recognize this, the greatersupport we are likely to be to him. 8 And finally, here is the psychiatrist and phenomenologist John Heaton on play. [P]lay is the performance of the movement as such. It is nothing to do with the attitude of a subject who musttake up a playful attitude to an object \"play\" in order thatplaying can occur. . . . If this is not realized, then play becomes distorted, as is commonly done in . . . educational . . . circles. . . belief and nonbelief . . . to[the child] beingand playing. . . . The game absorbs the player into itselfand thus takes from him the burden of [self-aware]initiative. . . . Play does not allow the player behavetowards it like an object. . . . [It] does not point to purposes beyond itself, it celebrates itself. It creates a structure in which the identity of the player is lost. . . . Its nature is completely distorted if it is considered psychologistically as a known thing about which assertions can be made and whichpeople then set forth to cultivate. 975.In this light, the British government's championing of structured play is comprehensively exposed for what it is\u2014a self-contradictory and incoherent notion rooted in quite fundamental and materialisticmisunderstandings about the nature of human existence and coming-into-being. Anxiety and the Adult-Centric Disruption of Healthy Early Learning How serious a mistake it would be to try to make little children grow along the lines, which these records show, they can follow. They must be given a large measure of freedom toimagine or to think as the need and occasion arises. If we triedto teach them these things formally, or to exert pressure upon them in these directions , we should simply waste our time, and might even do positive damage . \u2014 Susan Isaacs, Intellectual Growth in Young Children While Rudolf Steiner was still alive, Susan Isaacs took part in some detailed qualitative research into young children's behavior at the Malting House School in Cambridge, England (1924-1927), part of which is exhaustively detailed in her book Intellectual Growth of Young Children . The book offers recurrent vindication to Waldorf educational philosophy. Notonly was Isaacs deeply aware of the need to respect and to not intrudeupon children's early development, but, as a psychoanalyst, she was alsohighly attuned to the deleterious effects of anxiety upon learning. Accordingto Isaacs, \"Mental alertness and an active interest in objects are verydependent upon freedom from anxiety and inner tension.\" 10 For her, make- believe play (which I would argue must be freely chosen, if it is to fulfill thefollowing purpose) brings \"indirect aid to the intellectual life . . . by givingexternal body and form to the fantasized wishes and guilts of infancy, and thus allaying anxiety. \" 11 In other words, rather than having an inappropriate over-intellectualized and prematurely objective concreteness eternally76.foisted upon her, the young child needs an unintruded-upon space in which to play with, elaborate, and work through her deepest wishes, anxieties, and unconscious fantasies, in order to gain competence in healthilymanaging with her own freely developed will her curiosities and anxieties about relational being and human existence. Couple this with the psychoanalytic insight that emotional states are unconsciously transferred between people\u2014with young children beingparticularly susceptible to picking up and being affected by others' emotionslong before they are remotely able consciously to understand process and integratesuch intersubjective influences \u2014and we have a lethally poisonous cocktail. Imagine, for example, the inner tensions and resultant anxieties anddevelopmental distortions that are being set up within young childrenthrough their being preoccupied by, and having somehow to manage, theirresolvable conflict between their own nascent inner will forces, on theone hand, and an externally imposed adult-centric agenda on the other. Itis little wonder that, within a few years of these imposed regimes of earlyformal learning, children suffer a malaise in their healthy capacity to learn.This is then responded to by ratcheting up that same poisonous world-view rather than dropping rampant control-freakery for long enough to allowinsight into what might be going wrong. Imagine, further, the effects upon young children of being force-fed Early Learning Goals by adults trying to pretend that they are not so doing(and hence, incidentally, offering children quite appalling models ofinauthenticity to imitate). And these adults typically carry with them all the anxieties associated with OFSTED, 12 such as learning targets, impending inspections, and so forth. Young children unconsciously pick up all such anxiety and perhaps unwittingly make it their own (given that they are developmentally not yetable to differentiate between their own autonomous feelings and those theyare absorbing from the adults and the environment around them). And all77.this before we even begin to consider the likely effects on young children of adults relating to them with an adult-centric preoccupying agenda of learning goals. Relating in this manner cannot but compromise the extentto which those adults are capable of a full emotional and relationalengagement with the young child\u2014and again, with the child learning through modeling and imitation that human relationship entails beingpreoccupied with one's own agenda, rather than respecting and trusting the will and freedom of children to find their own developmental path. 13 No wonder our culture displays increasing signs of difficulties inrelationship, and a pathological narcissism and its associated characterdisorders. Seen in this light, what is happening in public early years education is nothing short of the criminal violation of early childhood; and the long-term psychosomatic and psychological price our children are likely to payfor this violation is quite incalculable. The Pernicious Deforming Effects of Premature Cognitive-Intellectual Development Children who are pushed too hard academically, and who consequently advance temporarily beyond their peers, mayultimately pay a price in terms of lost opportunities fordevelopment. \u2014Professor Patrick Bateson and Paul Martin There is substantial psychotherapeutic literature on the dangers of premature intellectual/ego development, which strongly supports Steiner's insightful cautions in this area. Psychotherapist Robert Royston,for example, describes how \"intellectual inhibition and dysfunction\" in adultlife can be traced back to \"a dominating autocratic object\" who, in thepatient's childhood, established a relationship of domination in which thechild's own natural integrated development was disrupted. Thus, \"the78.child's developmental agenda and establishment of an independent self are impaired in service to the [intense narcissistic] needs of the object.\"14 Intellectual blocking and the negation of memory are the kind of adultsymptoms that result from the person's inability to digest mentally such abad childhood experience. Moreover, such debilitating adult psychologicalsymptoms are exceedingly difficult to treat successfully because the patienttends to feel compelled to defeat the therapeutic healing process. 15 In psychoanalytic object relations theory, an object can be any human person or cultural-environmental influence that the child imbibes (orintrojects, in object-relations terminology) and makes part of her developingpsyche. Royston continues, \"In psychodynamic terms, the autocratic objectgives the self of the subject no space to flourish and instead pushes its own narcissistic needs center stage , forcing the other, in a variety of different possible ways, to bear witness to the object's superiority.\" 16 Further, tending to operate \"through a range of covert, almost invisible interactions,\" theautocratic object \"uses his or her interactive power to stifle the individualityof the child and will not brook independent ideas or challenge to his or heroften dogmatic ideas and maxims.\" 17 I argue that the intrusive adult-centric, over-intellectual agenda of the early years public school environmentconstitutes an autocratic object that may well be doing systematic and untolddamage to a whole generation of cognitively hot-housed children. And itshould also be clear from this example how we can use the clinical evidencefrom psychotherapeutic data to verify the insights that Steiner bequeathedto us nearly a century ago. 18 Discussion Materialistic learning . . whose purpose . . . is not to make culture, not to serve the living cosmos, but toharness humankind to the dead forces of materialism.79.Education, as we know it, from pre-school through graduate school, damages the soul. \u2014 Robert Sardello If the above analysis is correct, then we might expect to witness signs of the harm being done by the current early years educational regime\u2014 though of course it is essentially impossible to separate the respective effectsof the educational environment per se and the pernicious effects of modemculture more generally (e.g., Healy, 1990 ). Take a disturbing front-page story in The Observer: \" Mind control drug threat to children.\" 19 It reported on the frightening scale of medically diagnosed child \"behavioraldisorders,\" with \"tens of thousands of schoolchildren with being drugged with Ritalin . . . simply order to controlthem.\" It is by no means far-fetched to propose a causal relationship betweenthe burgeoning and comparatively recent epidemic in child behavioraldisturbances and recent (and autocratically objectionable!) early years policyinnovations, which demand a relentless and intrusive control-freaksurveillance, measurement, assessment, and testing of children'sdevelopmental process\u2014not to mention the forced imposition of premature,adult-centric, cognitive-intellectual learning at ever-earlier ages. In England, Ritalin prescriptions rose from 3,500 in 1993 to no less than 126,000 in 1998\u2014a thirty-six fold increase in five years. The articlehighlighted psychiatrists' proposed new drug prescribing powers forbehaviorally disordered children\u2014which represents a chronic misdiagnosisof what is at root a profound educational and cultural malaise. For ratherthan attention deficit and hyperactivity being medically pathologized andtheir sufferers subjected to normalizing biological treatment, thesesymptoms are surely far better understood as children's healthy responseto, and unwitting commentary on, technological culture's ever-escalatingmanic over-stimulation and the routine violence it is doing to children's80.healthy development\u2014not least its cognitively biased distortions of early child development. And until our policy-makers develop the insight torecognize and to respond to this malaise at a cultural level rather than at anindividualized medical level, as is now done, the prevalence of children'sbehavioral difficulties will inevitably continue to escalate. Another tell-tale sign of the damage being perpetrated on our young children is the research by Dr. Judith Whitburn of UK's prestigious NationalInstitute of Economic and Social Research, reported in the Times Educational Supplement (\"Nursery lessons 'damage' learning\"). 20 Whitburn found that because English children start school so young, \"many do not have thesocial behavioral skills necessary to learn.\" 21 Before long, the seemingly positive effects of the head-start they receive from early formal schoolingare swamped by a learning malaise around six or seven\u2014leading in turn tosignificant, underperformance in maths compared with their Japanesecounterparts, who start formal schooling later. In a letter published in the Times Educational Supplement, \"Stop damaging nursery children,\" 22 I wrote: \"It seems highly likely [Whitburn's] findings will apply to educationalperformance in general. . . . In the light of these findings it will beextraordinarily irresponsible if the government persists with its massivelyover prescriptive formalization of our early years learning environment.\" Conclusion The lucid interpretation, the concise formula can be a misleading picture for the child; and indeed, a strain\u2014 an impossible demand on his emerging powers of representation . The nursery age child is not struggling for clarity, she isstruggling for articulation. \u2014 Adam Phillips (author's emphasis)81.Overall, then, the principal concern here is that those whose early childhood development is inappropriately intruded upon and distorted are likely to end up suffering from emotional-behavioral disturbances inchildhood, or\u2014as psychotherapist Adam Phillips has graphically arguedin his important contribution to the Anna Freud symposium 23\u2014 end on the analyst's couch down the road. And the fear is that such pernicious long-term effects certainly will not be picked up by public education policy-makers until it is far too late to do anything about it. _________________________ Footnotes: 1 See, for example, my article in Steiner Education , 34 (1), 2000, \"But what about childhood?\" Goleman, Susanne. p9, p16, 5 Times Educational Supplement, October 8, 1999. 6 Isaacs, Susan.

Harwood Waldorf Journal Project #2 from Child and Man, No. 2, Vol. 12 From about the age of three, children begin to be full of questions, and it is sometimes a matter of great difficulty for their parents to find the right answers. Every question demands its own individual answer, but itcan be of great value, in deciding what answers to give, to have a clear ideaof the kind of answer required. For it is altogether wrong to imagine that alittle child should be given (or even want) the same kind of answer as wouldbe suitable for a child of eleven or twelve, but in a simpler form. The range of questions, which even young children will ask, is truly astonishing. Indeed, in many respects the youngest children will often askthe most fundamental and far reaching questions\u2014on life and death, andlife after death, and many subjects on which parents have often resignedall hope of definite knowledge. A child of four (to quote an actual example)has asked these questions in the space of a few minutes: Do men die? Will you die? Shall I die? What do the angels say to you? Are angels shy? Who made God? Do you like God? When you die doyou come alive again?86.It must come as something of a shock to little children if parents declare themselves unable to answer questions fundamental to a knowledge of human life, and the questions of children must be a challenge to manyparents to carry their thinking to the point of becoming clear and certain onmany things, which they are often content to leave unsettled. There are two things, however, to be noticed about the questions of little children; they will often ask question after question in rapid succession,as though it were not so much information they were seeking, as thesatisfaction of hearing the answering voice; and they will listen with morepleasure to an imperfect answer, which is spoken with love and warmth inthe voice, than to a complete and final reply given in a matter-of-fact tone.It is, indeed, to a large extent true that, when little children pour out theirendless questions, they are seeking something much deeper than the meresatisfaction of curiosity; they are seeking to bring around them the livingtones of the human voice. For the voices which they hear do not remainarrested in their consciousness, as is the case with adults, but penetrateeven to those deep unconscious processes which take place in the buildingup of the physical body. Indeed Rudolf Steiner has shown the exactconnections of the sounds of the alphabet with the formation of differentorgans of the body, and hence it is that eurythmy, which expresses thevarious sounds of language and music in movements of the limbs, is notonly an art but can be used as a means of healing. It is, therefore, just as much a matter of how you answer little children's questions as what you answer. Pure full tones of speech (andmodern voices, especially those of intellectual people, are often terriblyclipped and dry) not only give a child a feeling of blessing, they help himform his bodily strength for later life. A child is first nourished by his mother-milk and then by his mother-tongue.87.As a guide to what kind of answers little children need, often a child will supply the answer to his own questions and not infrequently reject the one given by the adult for another of his own invention. Such answers whichchildren give to themselves as a rule are much more full of fantasy thanthose which an adult would supply. A child asks: Why does the sun takethe water up into the sky? then adds: Is it for the angels to drink? Or seeinga piece of wire-netting over the funnel of a steam-roller, he asks: Why dothey put the netting on it? immediately adding: It must be to keep thebirds from building their nests there. It is not easy for an adult to copy this wonderful power of fantasy, and a sense of intellectual truth may often stand in the way. But it is alwaysgood to remember that what little children need is a certain living fantasyin the answers they receive. To offer them logical explanations (howevertrue to a scientific mind) is to give them a stone when they ask for bread. Sometimes little children's questions arise plainly from their desire to unite themselves with words to the objects around them. A child sees acaterpillar for the first time and asks: \"What is that?\" \"A caterpillar.\" \"Whatis a caterpillar?\" What he wants from the second question is not a definitionof a caterpillar in ideas but the joyous affirmation of the reality before him:\"That is a caterpillar.\" \"A gypsy-woman lives by telling people their fortunesand interpreting their dreams,\" says the King of Ireland's Son. \"That iswhy she is called a gypsy-woman.\" When children have passed the age of six or seven, they naturally need much more connected answers to their questions. They wait moreconsciously for the reply, instead of living in the speech. It is at this age, forinstance, that children will ask many questions about the heavenly bodies,the nature of the sun and stars, the creation of the world, and so forth. Andready to supply the answer are numerous children's encyclopedias, books,and what not, with beautiful diagrams of the sun, a flaming ball on a black88.page, many times the size of the earth, or a man cut in half showing the heart like a pump, the lungs like a pair of bellows, the nervous system likea set of telegraph wires, and so forth. Whether or not these things are inany sense representations of the truth is not for the moment the question,though it is worth noticing that by the time scientific theories reach popularchildren's books, they are often quite out of date even judged by their ownstandards. There will be plenty of time for children to investigate scientific theories at a later age, when they can really understand some of theconceptions on which they are based. For these scientific conceptions aroseonly at a definite point in human history, and the mind of a child is not tobe compared to the wave of intellectual thinking which historically broughtthem to birth. A child between seven and twelve or so has in him muchmore of the piety and luxuriant imagination of the Middle Ages. To thechild, the stars are not vast spheres incredible millions of miles distant inspace; he feels their clear shining beauty as something very close to him.The sun is not a huge stationary mass of burning gasses; its rising each dayfills him with a wonderful feeling of joy and thankfulness. The pictures ofthe heavenly bodies in mythologies are far truer to children than thedistances and dimensions of modern astronomy. The Norse people said that wolves swallowed up the sun at the time of an eclipse, and to a child, who has a fine sense of the devouringquality of darkness, the nature of an eclipse is much better expressed bysuch an image than by a diagram of revolving shadows. For in an eclipse itis truly as though the wolves devoured the sun, and that \"as though\" is,after all, the furthest claim made by the true scientist. Newton did not saythat the planets are attracted to the earth by gravity, but that they move asthough they were so attracted, and it is not his fault that men have made adogma of a hypothesis.89.It is, in fact, of real importance not to give a child scientific conceptions on these subjects too soon. They tend to destroy the vivid feeling and imagination proper to this age; and, because they are received beforethe child has developed the power of following the thoughts on which theyare based, they become matters of faith instead of matters of knowledge.Few adults have even the will to investigate the mathematics on which isbased the Newtonian planetary system or modern atomic theories. In asense a scientific age is the most credulous of all ages. A thousand yearsago a man could at least say: \"I see the sun move with my own eyes.\" To-day many have to say, \"Somebody proved a long time ago that the sunstands still. I forget exactly who it was, and I don't know how he proved it,but it's a fact all the same.\" When children begin at this age to ask, \"How a thing is made?\" it is worthwhile considering how much of the true explanation has real meaningfor them. There are children's books to describe how everything is made,but from such books children often get a superficial, almost glib, impressionof the work men have to do in the world. Such works are generally illustratedwith photographs, which give children an easy picture of various processes,but little feeling for the real conditions under which the work is done. Afew flashlight pictures of miners hacking at a seam, together with a sectionof a mine with the cage descending, and a child will soon think he knowsall about a coal mine and turn to the next page to discover how agramophone works or what the Great Wall of China looks like. But there issomething extraordinarily superficial, muddled, and uncreative about sucha way of acquiring information. It is really far better for children to maketheir own pictures in their mind's eye from living descriptions they hear ofthe intense silence under the ground, of men walking to their work formiles in galleries where they cannot go upright, of the dripping of water,and so forth. In short, they should have such a picture of the inwards of the90.earth as George MacDonald gives of the interior of a mountain at the beginning of The Princess and Curdie . And, above all, in the mind, there should not be an isolated fact. A knowledge of mining should come as partof the children's general thoughts at the time, in some connection with chemistry, perhaps, or history or geology. One of the worst results of children's How It Works books is that a child will often collect an extraordinary amount of theoretical informationand forget to observe things which come within his own ken. Many children can describe the solar system but do not know when or where the full moon rises or what planets are in the sky. They know a lot about the assembling of an automobile but are vague as to how butter or cheese or soap is made.It is always best to try to keep younger children's questions, as to how things are made, to those objects that they can really understand and observe, perhaps by making them themselves. Generally speaking, it is much easier to impart information to children too early than to tactfully withhold it until a better season. A certain reticence in answering children's questions is of great help in keeping the questioning faculty alive. For it is a sad fact that the powerof asking questions only too often fades away as children grow older. It is perhaps a test of whether children's questions have been answered rightly in their younger years to see how profound are the questions they ask whenthey are older, and if they are readily satisfied with the answers. By the time they reach a more intellectual understanding towards the age of fourteen, they should have a strong desire to probe every question in life to the bottom, and not be lightly satisfied by theory without knowledge. For children of this age, there is a deep meaning in that part of the story ofParsifal where, as a young man, he first sees the wounded knight but does not ask of him the question he should. Many of the questions which children should have in their hearts at this age will indeed only be answered by life itself. They stand on the threshold of life, and life will answer them, but only if they put to life the right questions.91.Non-V erbal Education: A Necessity in the Developmental Stages by Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler , M.D. Waldorf Journal Project #2 translated by Martyn Rawson Steiner Education , Vol. 34, No. 2 It is not moral preaching and not reasoned instruction that work on children in the right way: that which works is what the adults in their surroundings do visibly before their eyes. \u2014 Rudolf Steiner Typically, human beings never finish learning, and even when getting older they will keep adding new things to what has already been attained. At the same time, it is obvious that the degree and manner oflearning changes during the course of life. Every stage of life is speciallyadapted to certain learning processes. This shows most significantly in thefirst twenty years where, along with bodily growth, the soul-spirit's abilityto take things in and a readiness to learn are buoyant. With this sketch asbackground, we may focus our attention on the preschool years. The Development of Learning Ability up to the Beginning of Adulthood During the course of their development children learn in different ways. In the first years it happens through imitation: e.g., walking, talking,92.thinking, the handling of objects, getting dressed and undressed, eating habits, shaking hands when meeting people, and much more. What liesbehind this? Learning through imitation means teaching yourself accordingto a perceived role model. Without any explanations or pedagogicalinstruction being given, children absorb all the events happening aroundthem, practicing out of their own inner drive until they have attained thecorresponding skills. Children do not learn to speak through explanation,nor do they learn to walk through instructions on how to move. They learnthese complicated and far reaching human capacities solely through theirown inner drive, modeled on the pattern provided by adults. Thisconcentrated, imitative learning of the child\u2014an activity, which is kindledby the role model and tirelessly practiced\u2014is here termed non-verballearning, i.e., learning without words. Parents who endeavor to set anexample for their children in this manner could, therefore, be called non-verbal educators. An example might make clear what this means. In adoctor's practice it often happens that when a mother and child come intothe office a problem arises. The doctor has greeted the mother and thenturns to the child who also holds out her hand. Often with little children itis not the right hand but the left. The mother who knows about non-verbaleducation will look on calmly while the child gives the doctor her left hand. The doctor takes it in a friendly way, however, the mother who is not accustomed to this method of child-upbringing will immediately instructthe child to give the doctor the \"proper\" hand. Ashamed or disappointed,the child often will just withdraw her hand. The spontaneous readiness togreet has vanished; sometimes the hand sinks down listlessly or slips behindthe back, and an awkward silence arises. How different it is for the childwho shakes hands out of pure imitation, where it is left to the doctor todetermine whether, after having taken the left hand and said, \"Hello,\" healso does the same thing with the right hand, or simply leaves it at one93.handshake, knowing full well that things will correct themselves between the ages of five and seven. If people correct children verbally in the preschool years, their age- appropriate mode of learning is not supported, bringing an element intotheir education that is only applicable to a later stage of life. Since a pre-school child is able to understood the meaning of an action intuitively andthen imitate it, he or she is not ready to take on board explanations aboutthe deed. The readiness for action\u2014both the will and the physical motoric(i.e., its movement) is still bound to the sense experience. The eminent Frenchdevelopmental psychologist Jean Piaget identified this phase as sensory-motor intelligence ( senso stands for sense experience; motor stands for organs of movement, i.e., the muscular system). Intelligence and meaning are notyet abstracted independently from the bodily experience, but work directly,intuitively through the senses so that the movement, dependent upon thesenses, happens as one, unified, imitative process. In the most intelligentway, children can do what they see and repeat what they hear. Everythingthat they experience is understood immediately, even if they have no wordsor concepts for it. The whole sense world is experienced directly and\"sensibly\"\u2014it instantly \"makes sense!\" This only changes when thinkingbecomes emancipated from the body at which point direct sense experienceis lost. When this emancipation occurs, sense experience is accompaniedmore and more by thought. It is more conscious. This later mode of learning,grounded in thinking, is much harder to attain and goes much more slowlythan the intuitive preschool mode. It is therefore important not to shorten the imitative phase by developing abstract intelligence prematurely. However, this is exactly whathappens when the little child is educated verbally, through explanationsbeing offered. Moreover, this premature awakening of abstract intelligencelames the imitative faculty. Waldorf Kindergarten teachers experience this94.often, for example, when a child of four is admitted who has already \"enjoyed\" this mode of verbal education. Such children are often seenstanding apart or lolling around with their hands in their pockets watchingwhat the others are doing. They have no inclination to enter into the gamesthat are going on so uninhibitedly and imitatively. It usually takes six monthsor longer till they are ready to join in and, through seeing what the othersare doing, become just as involved. Why is it so important that preschool children have the opportunity to imitate as much as possible? This is because every activity, and especiallyevery physical skill which arises through imitation, not only preparesabilities for later life but also gives impetus to the healthy development ofphysical functioning during those years. We must not forget that childrenare not only learning; day by day they are growing up. Learning andgrowing are inextricably bound together. So the question is: does everylearning process also support the child's physical development? It is obviousthat physical development in children is best stimulated by copying andparticipating in activities that require skillful dexterity rather than by sittingstill\u2014as for instance in front of the television or playing with electronicallycontrolled toys and games where a minimum of skillful movement isrequired. It is also good, where possible, to avoid being hemmed in withinsmall apartments without any interesting things going on that stimulateimitation. Rather, give them the possibility to bring all their physicalcapacities into play (particularly their movement capability, sense of balance,and their fine and gross motor skills). Every act of learning is at the same time an act of will. Learning requires effort. With preschool children, the will is still integrally bound tothe sensory activity, without any intervening cognition. Uniquely, this givesthe possibility for optimal learning in accordance with the functions of thesense organs and the interest with which the child uses his sense organs totake in the world. Some children have more interest, some less. There are95.those with the possibility of wide-awake attention and those whose powers of attention are weak. The adults must know how they can awaken thechildren's interest and gain their attention. This happens when whateverneeds to be done is undertaken joyfully and with enthusiasm. Somethingdone with care and in a loving, enthusiastic manner evokes the child'sinterest much more than when you do things in a listless, disinterested oreven grudging way. Something similar can be seen also with older children.For example, when it is a question of who should clear up after the meal, ifsomeone jumps up and says, \"I'll wash up today. Anyone coming to help?\"and then disappears into the kitchen to make a start, others will now followsuit, rather than when everyone gets up quietly after the meal and tries tomake himself invisible with the hope that someone else will do it. The moreconvinced an adult is about what he does, the more attractive it is for theimitative situation of the child. All this changes when school begins andthe child's readiness to act becomes more independent of sense impressions.As motivation, he now needs his feelings to be stirred, for between thechange of teeth and puberty the feeling life develops. The children now donot react primarily to what they see and experience, but to what they feel.They judge everything they experience according to feeling. Sympathy andantipathy play a big part in this. Which teacher they like, which clothesplease them, which pupils in the class are \"slow\" (as some children putit)\u2014all this is affirmed and discussed. What pleases them and what doesnot play a big role in all they do. The teacher must succeed in arousingfeelings that give wings to their willingness to learn. However, with learningalways being bound up with effort, it cannot only be a matter of the pupilslearning what they enjoy learning. It is much more important that the pupilslearn to love making an effort of will in the whole process of learning. Theycan achieve this when they come to like the adult concerned. Indeed, just atthis age we meet the phenomenon of those pupils making good progress inthe subjects where they like the teacher. For example, a child who has never96.understood anything in mathematics suddenly becomes quite a successful pupil after a change of teachers, with the new one having an empatheticconnection with the child. At this age, naturally, verbal education is necessary. It is also appropriate because the intelligence of the child has become emancipatedto the extent that she can retain in her memory what the teacher has said.She grasps the meaning that is contained in word and sentence independently of outer action. This ability appears towards the end of theKindergarten, when it is time for elementary school to begin. You canrecognize this in how children listen to a story. As long as they remain inthe non-verbal mode of learning their memory is not yet independent. Theylove to hear the same stories again and again and to play the same gamesover and over. Grownups are often amazed that the children do not getbored. They do not because their memory has not yet reached this level ofindependence; the intelligence lives completely in activity. The childrenhave, so to speak, a repetitive memory. In the repetition of an event or storythey feel that they know it already. The pleasure of remembering only stirswhile re-enacting the event or re-hearing the story, and not in theindependent way that is later the case. This new mode of learning hops tothe forefront between the sixth and eighth years. You first notice it when allof a sudden the child does not want her beloved bedtime story, but insteadwants to hear something new. When she no longer lights up happily whenmother says that it's time for Snow White , but objects: \"I know that one so well already, I want a different one\"\u2014then this moment has come. As longas the children are glad to hear the same story repeated again and againthey are still in the non-verbal phase in which intelligence is not accessibleto them in abstracto . After puberty, eagerness to act requires yet another motivation. Neither example nor feeling alone provides sufficient motivation. Youngpeople must see for themselves what they have to do. It becomes more and97.more evident that adolescents will only do what they understand, while acknowledging the reasons. Will and readiness for action have now becomedependent on thinking and on insight. Young people do not want to carryout an action primarily to please an adult, but because they see somejustification for it. If these different modes of learning in childhood andyouth are taken into account, the task of education is made easier. If not,problems and conflicts arise which have to be overcome every single dayand are deleterious for the climate of learning. How does one learn to educate non-verbally? We are often faced with the predicament\u2014how do we react in the preschool years when the child refuses to do what we ask. How do we get the child to do what we want without a huge torrent of explanation andjustification? Here one can learn a great deal in one of the Kindergartenswhere non-verbal education is practiced. In the Waldorf Kindergarten, forexample, it works as follows. When the children are playing outside, walkingon stilts or building little dens, and it is time to come indoors to eat, manyof them get upset at the thought of their fun being curtailed. It is a greathelp, in such circumstances, if the meal is always at the same time and thechildren are accustomed to it. Habit is an important support for non-verbaleducation. It becomes self-evident that you follow the routine. The Kindergarten teacher goes from group to group, singing the song that she sings every morning, signifying that they leave their treasuredgame and come in to eat. A few children are already following her. Thisextends into a little parade which affects and draws the others. More andmore join in until the whole group goes inside. No scolding, no admonition,no telling off\u2014simply going inside embraced by everyone. A mother once said to me, \"When I hear you speaking like this I find it all perfectly understandable; but then when I'm at home I alwaysask myself, why has my clarity disappeared? It does not work as I hoped it98.would.\" This is the kind of problem that confronts people who are embarking on non-verbal education. So why is it so difficult? Why is ithardly possible today for an adult to refrain from a whole rigmarole ofexplanations when he wants something from a child? He has to learn thatinstead of words he needs to act with concentration. One has to dosomething that usually does not happen today, unite oneself with whatone wishes in such a way that one can perform it almost as a ritual, throughone's whole disposition, and then bring it to full expression. When I speakabout something and simultaneously think about it, I am immediatelydistanced from it. I think \"about\" it. I talk \"about\" it. I am not it. I am not init\u2014I am not completely at one with it. It cannot speak out of me, or allow itto manifest through me. This disconnected \"talking about a thing\" is rampant today. With one person you talk about something in one way and with another personyou talk about it in another way; opinions have something relative aboutthem; you do not want to tie yourself down. This is typical of the intellectualculture in which we live. One distances oneself; one does not take thingsseriously but remains \"objective.\" Seldom is it necessary to really throwyourself heart and soul into something. Many pupils are not used to takingseriously something that has been said by an adult. They think everythingcan be discussed and made negotiable\u2014that ultimately it is not decisive.And then they are extremely surprised when they meet a grownup whoseevery word carries weight. Today we have all been brought up in this rather hazy, noncommittal way of life. This means that a degree of uncertainty will have brushed offon us. Most people have inferiority complexes\u2014they know they do notreally understand a lot of what is going on in the world. This kind ofuncertainty in judgment, resulting in being unable to form an opinion, iswidespread. Also, relativity widespread, is the feeling that what one thinkshas only limited value; everything could actually be quite different.99.Openness and critical distance are naturally indispensable preconditions for a genuine and realistic striving after knowledge. But they areundermining for the phase of non-verbal education. At that age childrensimply want to experience the meaning in everything that confronts them.If the adult cannot give this meaning because he or she is not convinced, oris uncertain or experiences things as relative and only of limited importance,the child does not receive what she or he needs. They lose confidence, andthrough this many typical educational problems belonging to this age groupensue. The rediscovery of body language Nowadays there is a whole spectrum of psychotherapies\u2014different schools ranging from sensitivity training to Gestalt therapy\u2014which aim to convey to people what they think and feel inwardly, and how to relearn toexpress this in an honest way, through the body as well, and to show this inbody language. It has been shown that many people become ill throughunbearable tension arising between what they experience inwardly andthe fa\u00e7ade that they show to the world. It is not that I am recommendingthe above-named psychotherapeutic methods for learning how to educatenon-verbally. I merely want to emphasize that the possibility of non-verbaleducation\u2014that is, the ability to show through body language withoutwords what one is thinking and what is meaningful\u2014is something whichis very foreign to many adults in our time, and symptoms of illnesses oftenappear as a consequence. For learning how to educate in a non-verbal way I have two recommendations. First, eurythmy where in every movement somethingmeaningful and entirely in correspondence with feeling and thinking isbrought to expression\u2014providing one practices diligently. Second, actingor drama, where one learns to move expressively and only to say what onereally has to at a particular moment. It would be ideal if parents of pre-100.school children would get together in groups, and act small scenes in mime in order to express thoughts and feelings, patterns of behavior, commandsand taboos, as well as everyday problems in a non-verbal way. They shouldthen exchange feedback about what they have experienced. It is fascinatingto see how engaged children become when an adult makes an interestingmovement or when his face has a meaningful expression that is inclinedtowards mimicry. They love this sort of thing. Not wanting to let him escapefrom them, they will do everything he wants. They love to provoke simpleexpressive reactions in adults and like it when their parents show theiremotions. In this connection, it often happens that children in the Kindergarten pick up all sorts of rude words and trot these out provocatively in one oranother situation. A typical case might be as follows. A mother meets anacquaintance on the street and begins a conversation. Little Johnny standsthere and begins using rude words: crap, shit, suck, and so forth. Withinterest he observes how the friend becomes uncomfortable and the motherbecomes embarrassed. Meanwhile Johnny is relishing the scene. But if thegrownups continue talking unperturbed and ignore his silly prattle as asign that it does not cut any ice, the child will soon realize that the effort isnot worth it. How does it happen that children instinctively know either that they have succeeded with such provocation or that it is not worth their while?Had Johnny just been walking with his mother alone, in all probability hewould not have come out with anything of the sort. Such words only cameinto his mind when his mother started talking to her friend. Once again, in the non-verbal phase, children instantly absorb the meaning of all sensory experiences. They do not experience the senseexperience separate from rational understanding. So it is possible for themintuitively to grasp the moral qualities in the soul life of the adult. Thatwhich occurs for us adults in later life only in special situations when, for101.example, we sense that there is an \"atmosphere\" in a room we are entering, or when we notice that two people are in love with each other\u2014this is adaily and ongoing occurrence for children. As soon as the mother meetsher friend, the child feels that her interest has been deflected from himtowards the other person. Through his provocative behavior he would liketo bring it about that he is once again the center of her attention. However,he must learn that this cannot always be, and the mother achieves this whenshe is quite consistent in doing what she considers is right\u2014in this case,continuing to talk to her friend. If she empathizes with the child, andunderstands how he feels a little forlorn, it will be easy for her, even whileshe's talking, to keep casting a glance at him, or make some little movementso that he does not feel left high and dry. In this way she may pre-empt thechild's becoming provocative. Conditions for free and responsible action There is yet a third hindrance vis-a-vis non-verbal education\u2014the wish of many parents to allow their child to be free, not to follow directions. Hence, in order that he is not alienated, the three-year-old is asked what hewould like to eat or what clothes he would like to wear. Whoever realizesthat children of this age learn through example and are prone to taking onboard any uncertainty in the adult's attitude (for example that he isindecisive about what he wants and therefore asks the child) will changehis stance for the sake of the child. Freedom can only develop when onehas achieved one's own mature insight. Of course, there are preliminarystages in the development of freedom. In the non-verbal phase of educationthis consists in allowing the child to imitate what he sees unrestrictedlyand without reserve. He must be allowed to move freely. The house shouldbe so organized that one does not have to prohibit the children from this orthat; rather their impulse towards activity should be allowed free rein. Theexample comes from the grownups, but the way in which the child responds102.is freely experienced and freely formed. Similarly, later at school, when the children learn something because they like their teacher, the element offreedom plays an important role. Because the child likes doing something,she feels free, even if the impulse for the activity has originated from anadult and not from herself. If children have been allowed to develop throughthese preliminary stages, they will also be in the position after puberty whenindependent thinking and powers of judgment ripen, to act out of free,self-determined insight and personal understanding. Only then is truefreedom possible. To summarize: in the preschool era, the key is trust in adults and free play of movement; in the school years love and joy of doing; and inadulthood, recognition for what is true and right is the precondition forfree and responsible action. Adults who bring trust towards the children so that they will make use of their freedom at maturity will feel themselves, in the time up tothen, like a proxy, merely replacing those capabilities over which the childhas no sovereignty during the course of her education. They will hold backwherever the child has reached a sufficient degree of independence.Correspondingly, the child initially brings to the adult, and especially inthe preschool years, deep trust that the teacher will do what is right. Aninfant lying with open arms and open eyes, his diaper changed, is at thesame time an archetypal image of trust-filled bliss. She allows everythingto happen to her. Something of this original trust persists through the wholepreschool period, expressing itself also in the need to give herself over toimitation. The child regards everything that happens around her as worthyof imitation and trust. That is why it is so important that this trust is notbetrayed. It is betrayed, however, when the child experiences that an adultdoes not know his own mind. Likewise, when the course of the day lacksregularity and rhythm and security. But, if good habits are installed in theform of a definite sleeping-waking rhythm, in regular meal times, and103.regular alternation of play and rest, the child feels herself safe and protected, experiencing the course of such a day as something into which she maygladly enter. Without such clear and well-formed structure in the daily rounds, the growing organs of the child will not get the start in life which theyneed. Foundations for good functioning of the organs are laid when thereis a regular alternating between making that demand on the child andleaving her in peace. Many functional instabilities, in the sense ofpsychosomatic disorders in later life (automatic nervous system), have theirroots in bad eating habits in early childhood. If children eat only accordingto fad and fancy, with no appetite at meal times because they have beenconstantly nibbling and snacking in-between, the digestive organs will failto learn to work together strongly with regularity and then to relax. As can be gathered from the above, it is straightforward to understand the principle of non- verbal education; the challenge is to put itinto daily practice. About the Author: Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler is a pediatrician, school doctor and author of severalbooks. She has received worldwide acclaim as a lecturer on a variety ofthemes related to anthroposophical medicine. Dr. Gl\u00f6ckler is the leader ofthe Medical Section of the School of Spiritual Science at the Goetheanum,Switzerland.104.105.Child Observation and Study From the Kolisko Conference Stuttgart, Germany Waldorf Journal Project #2 Translated by Peter Hindenberger, M.D. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler, M.D., head of the Medical Section of the Goetheanum, presided over the Kolisko Conference, which was in honor of Dr. Eugen Kolisko (1893 -1939). It drew more than 180 Waldorf teachers,therapists, and medical doctors from more than 25 countries to Stuttgart,Germany. A week was spent discussing different aspects of childdevelopment. The topics included curricula of the upper classes (8th-12th),drugs, sects, difficult children, quiet children, school readiness, and so forth.The main theme focused on the six constitutional types of children: large-headed/small-headed, cosmic/earthly, and fantasy-rich, fantasy-poor. Alltypes are healthy; they action of the \"I\" on the physical, etheric,and astral body, respectively. Dr. Gl\u00f6ckler's lectures on these subjects were a rich source of information that reflected her knowledge and practical experience withWaldorf education.106.The Six Constitutional Types Found in Children by Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler The Large-Headed Child The main characteristic of this child is his/her large head in relation to his/her body. These children have large foreheads, a big occiput, and rosy checks. They are quite introverted with good concentration. They arerather dreamy and imaginative and quite artistic. They lack the hardeningelement as the \"I\" and the astral body are diverted from the nerve-sensesystem. Therapeutically, Rudolf Steiner indicates washing the head and neck with cold water in the morning and a diet rich in root vegetables for theirhigh content of salty substances. However, great care must be taken in theuse of salt. In eurythmy, consonants and the big U exercise are helpful.Medicinally, infants are given Plumbum 0.1% ointment on the occiput forfour weeks. prep. Dl0, 1 by Cuprum prep. D6, 1 pcpqam for two weeks to seal the process. School children take Plumbum prep.D20 for five weeks, followed by Cuprum sulfurkum D6 for two weeks.This can be repeated. Vitamin D and potentized hypophysis extract canalso be helpful. The Small-Headed Child This child is thin and pale. His/her head is small in relation to the body. Especially striking is the small cranium with its often-flat region. The face is quite defined. The small-headed child has poor concentration and iseasily distracted. Such children show an analytic \"bloodless\" imagination.The \"I\" and the astral body do not engage properly in the metabolic-limbsystem.107.As therapy this child should receive warm applications on the abdomen in the evening. Diet-wise these children need more sweet nutrients like dates, figs, and honey. Also leafy vegetables and teas are recommended. The choice and amount of sugar depends on the given situation. Wool is the fabric of choice in clothing. In eurythmy, vowels, especially the big Iexercises, and LM are helpful. Medicinally, silver applications in a lowpotency on the abdomen or as Bryophyllum argento cult 0.1% internally aswell as Primus baths are indicated. After five weeks, Ferrum prep. D8 should be given for two weeks to seal the process. This can be repeated. A good description of these two constitutional types can be found in Volume Oneof The Anthroposophical Approach to Medicine by Husemann/Wolff, p. 106. The Cosmic Child The head is the most cosmic part of our body. \"It bears the stamp of what we were before our birth, before our conception even. All that is souland spirit in us has left its mark there, we have therefore in our head apicture of our pre-earthly life. . . . The head is somehow apart from directconnection with the external world. . . . Thought and ideation are connected with the head, but not judgment. Judgment is connected with the middle organism, and particularly with arms and hands\" (Steiner, June 13, 1921).Cosmic children have a \"talent to live in the prenatal world\" (Gl\u00f6ckler).The head is well formed physically and functionally (angelic children)whereas the rest of the body lacks penetration of the formative forces. These children have good perception but are poor in executing and concluding a thought process. They have difficulties naming geometric forms. They donot like to engage in physical activities. Therapeutically the cosmic child needs to feel the geometry of a eurythmic form rather than the beauty. The eurythmist must ask the child to concentrate on walking a form exactly along imaginary lines. Walking on the balancing beam is also helpful. In main lesson, the teacher must evoke the child's feelings for a hero or compassion for an historic event.108.Thc Earthly Child In the case of what Steiner calls the earthly child, the forces of heredity work strongly, particularly in the metabolic-limb system. These children love earth and, therefore, always have dirty hands. They lovematerial things such as cars, television, electronic equipment, and so forth.They are fascinated by motion. They themselves are constantly in motion.They are practically oriented, although their fine motor skills are belowaverage and this handicap often causes outbreaks of bad temper. Sometimesthey dive into an activity without checking out the \"details.\" They can easilydefine geometric forms. In eurythmy, the beauty of a form needs to be stressed. An exercise should be walked first leaving out the earthly child, next the child who cando it most beautifully is asked to do it alone, and then the earthly child isencouraged to do it him/herself. Drawing of beautiful geometric formsand rhythmic play with bells seem to be helpful too. These children oftenneed special individual attention. The Rich in Fantasy Child These children have a good memory\u2014even too good of a memory. They cannot forget. Their memory-pictures do not only remain but acquire right away a power of their own and keep coming up again involuntarily.The \"I\" cannot bring the thoughts under control. These pictures come upagain, changed in form to fantastic imaginations: the child tells about thevisit to the zoo and all the animals she saw, how they talked to her, how sherode on them, and so forth. These children, these \"prisoners of the ideas they have received,\" (Steiner, June 15, 1921), need to give more attention to writing or paintingor any activity or exercise that brings them into movement such as eurythmyor gymnastics. In eurythmy, vowels done while stepping or walking arehelpful, so that the \"idea remains quietly in the organism instead of comingup again constantly and involuntarily\" (Steiner, June 15, 1921). In music,singing rather than playing an instrument assists these children.109.The Poor in Fantasy Child These children have little imagination. They easily forget. They must be encouraged to be more observant while they are reading and also to listen to what the teacher tells them in class. In eurythmy, they should dothe exercises mainly standing still so that their movements are mostly donewith their arms. Consonants are particularly helpful in calling up ideas.Instrumental music has the same effect. The goal in this type of child is to activate the \"I\" to master conscious thoughts. This can be achieved by reviewing the day, starting with the mostrecent event and then going back in time. It is often difficult to determine the type of a particular child. Often this is not possible because the child does not fit one of the six categories.She might be a hysteric, neurasthenic, \"poor in sulfur,\" or typical sanguinechild, and so forth. The variations are numerous. The safest way to workwith children is outlined in the lecture Steiner gave in Stuttgart on September22, 1920, when he talked about \"balance in teaching.\" He describes therelationship of the \"I\" to the other three bodies, noting the \"I\" can be toolittle or too much bound to the other bodies. Rudolf Steiner gives ideassimilar to the ones mentioned in this article. In a practical setting like aclassroom, he recommends that instructions change rhythmically betweenactivities that expand and contract a child's organism, so that the child isconstantly challenged by sympathy and antipathy. This helps the child tobe in the preschool with his/her whole being and, therefore, engage the \"I\" properly. Endnotes: Steiner, Rudolf. Balance in Teaching , Mercury Press, 1982. ____________.

Some Aspects of Child Study Work in Faculty Meetings by Magda Lissau We must learn to perceive the spiritual archetype of man through his picture nature. In the future, man will become to some extent transparent to his fellow man. The form of his head and his gait will awaken in us aninner sympathy and understanding of a different nature from what we findin human tendencies today. For we shall only know man as an ego-beingwhen we have this conception of his picture nature, when we can approachhim with the fundamental feeling that what the physical eyes perceive of aman bears the same relation to the true supersensible reality of man just asthe picture painted on canvas bears to the reality it depicts. We must developthis fundamental feeling in ourselves. We must approach man in such away that we no longer see him as a combination of bones, muscles, blood,and so forth, but as the image of his eternal, spiritual being (Rudolf Steiner,From Symptom to Reality in Modern History , Lecture V). In child study sessions, we take a group approach and attempt to fathom a human being's essence using Steiner's insights into the natureand being of humankind. There is a fundamental difference betweenindividual research and a group approach. Individual research, based on the individual's directed cognitive activity, relates the researcher to the research object. While this possiblynarrow focus is capable of producing great insights, 1 and while much of what Steiner indicated to teachers helps prevent a one-sided view, the groupapproach ensures greater objectivity. Also, it adds a universal dimensionnot otherwise attainable. Whenever group members weave together a fabricof understanding by listening to each other, avoiding the destructive side111.of intellectualism and encouraging heart-thinking in each other, then the picture built up together may touch on the eternal essence of the child andso lead to therapeutic insights. Such a conversation, which is at the heart ofa child study, is often referred to as Goethean conversation. The whole faculty should participate in child study, for the community educates the child in daily contact. Additionally, if there is aschool doctor, he or she should also participate. It is important that all teachers prepare well by reviewing their interactions with the respective child, picturing the child often. The classteacher or class guardian has traditionally given the bulk of the description,as she or he has known the child over a longer period of time and probablyhas contact over a longer part of each day. However, each teacher who hasregular contact with the student should contribute. A description of physicalaspects may be given by the school doctor. A child study has three basic parts: 1. Observations/descriptions/reports2. Conversation/building up the picture3. Conclusion/indication of exercises/therapy/tuition These parts are elaborated on the next page. ____________________________ Footnote: 1. An example of such insights can be found in the book The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat by Oliver Sacks.112.Points for Observation and Description in Child Study A. History of the child from conception and birth Report on events from early childhood: Pregnancy: normal, difficulties, maternal illness, stress, accidentsBirth: Normal, breach, Caesarean, complicationsFirst three years: crawling, walking, speech, memory, completesentences, when did the child refer to him or herself as \"I\"? Childhood diseases and other health problemsTeethingAccidentsPlay B. Physical description of the child (Only observations are noted here, not low/set high (ears are usually located betweenthe end of the nose and the eyes in a narrow/broad Perception and movement: Senses: go through all 12 senses and describe any peculiaritiesMovements: gross/fine motor movements\u2014describeGait: toe/heel first touching floor, rhythmic/uneven, shuffle/ springyMovement: characterize the movements if appropriate, such as a nervous, hoppy, placid, flighty, heavy, determined, tentative, abrupt, cautious, and so forthDominance: determine left/right dominance in eye, ear, hand, and foot C. Aspects related to the etheric body Temperament: sanguine/melancholic/ choleric/phlegmatic/mixedMemory peculiarities: What is the relationship to time?

Learning profile Type memory: to music: learn by imitation/by figuring out by self/ by being talked through/by acting out the relevant patterns/by repetition115.Group Dynamics However rich and superbly demonstrated the information is that we gather together in the description part of the child study session, it will be for naught unless a real process of discovery is begun. For the informationto become transformed into insight, specific group interaction has to takeplace. This could take several forms. The child study could be spread out over two or three sessions. In this case, the following three parts should be separated in time so thatdigestion of events takes place, and a picture may come about. The main concern during this time of group interaction is building up a picture of the student. All teachers should participate equally\u2014notonly the class teacher\u2014as this is a group effort to form a picture of theindividual under consideration. This is the crucial part\u2014a successfulconclusion depends on successful faculty work in building up a picture.Without a picture, no real insight is possible (only intellectual conclusions,which are not the same as insight based on the spiritual nature of the humanbeing). Careful conversation focused on understanding the individual witha positive attitude helps build up the picture, which serves as the basis ofthe third part. Goethean conversation is most useful because it is quitefocused\u2014participants need to listen intently to the presenting person. Thegroup creates an organ of perception, and this builds up the picture of thechild. Conclusion/Results/Special Therapy/Special Exercises/Tutoring Out of the picture of the essence of the individual arises the inspiration or the answer about what to do to help the child, to intensify the learning experience, the sensory experience, and so forth. We have nowdescribed the contents of these three parts of the faculty work leading to asuccessful child study. However, there are also considerations of style.116.Remarks on the Style of Group Interaction It is best if these three portions of the study are separated over time. It is particularly good to have them spaced over three weeks. (Over two weeks is certainly preferable to having all three parts pushed into one shortsession.) If a complete child study is done in one session, sufficient timemust be allotted. It is best to let the description rest for a week. Then, let thepicture that has been built up by the faculty also rest for a week. Finally, inthe third week decide on the kind of help the child needs, and what facultycan provide it. 1.During the observation/description part those who have something to offer should speak, moderated by the class teacher. Usually all teachers are asked prior to the study to focus theirobservations on the child for the week. 2. While the picture is built, Goethean conversation should prevail\u2014 all teachers, knowing the child, intimately or not, shouldparticipate as they wish. Letting the picture speak is the heart ofgroup-oriented child study. 3. On the basis of the picture, all faculty (particularly those who have some helpful expertise including tutoring, artistic, medical,curative) should now transform the picture into a deeper, fullermore complete one in line with the types of children, (fantasy/memory/iron/sulfuric and so forth) described by Steiner in hisCurative Course . It may be he1pful to realize that the first part\u2014the report\u2014is most closely related to cognitive activity, the second part\u2014group work\u2014involves the realm of feeling as the agent of picture transformation into intuitiveimage, and finally the third part\u2014resolution\u2014is related to the sphere ofwill.117.Overview of Childhood Characteristics Three Physical Types Four Temperaments Six Constitutional Types Seven Soul Types by David Mitchell Three Physical Types: Endomorph: Soft and spherical Large stomach and liver\u2014large food, and for affectionSociable, loves peopleFloats easily in water\u2014excess fatBehavior\u2014exhibits of relaxation and comfort Mesomorph: UprightFirm skinBig bones\u2014well developed heart and circulatory system Relatively strongLoves exercise, activityTries to dominate118.Ectomorph: Flat chest, pipe-stem arms and legs Thin, fragileLinearRestrainedCan be over-sensitiveDesires concealmentWithdraws from ordinary social occasions Temperaments: Sanguine: Build: slender, elegant, well-balancedWalk: on toes (dances butterfly)Eyes: lively, dancingRelationships: fickleFood: nibblesMemory: like a sieveInterest: the present, here and nowClothing: new and colorful To stimulate: ask a personal favor Parent and teacher attitude: show friendly interest, but be firm Phlegmatic: Build: big, fleshy, rotundWalk: plodding, often half-closedRelationships: friendly, impassive, reservedFood: eats most everything and is always interested in food119.Memory: good concerning the world Interest: the present, without getting involvedClothing: conservative To stimulate: speak directly to the point, use shock tactics Parent and teacher attitude: show calm strength Melancholic: Build: tall, bowed-head, bonyWalk: slow with a drooping, sliding gaitEyes: tragic, mournfulRelationships: poor, has sympathy only with fellow melancholics Food: finicky, especially likes sweetsMemory: good concerning selfInterest: self and the pastClothing: dark, drab, solid colors\u2014is difficult to please To stimulate: explain how others will suffer if he/she is not compliantParent and teacher attitude: show sympathy and empathize with suffering Choleric: Build: bullnecked, upright, short legs, huskyWalk: firm, heels dig into the ground with each stepEyes: energetic, activeRelationships: friendly as long as he/she is in commandFood: spicy120.Memory: poor Interest: the world, self, and futureClothing: individual and outstanding To stimulate: issue a challenge Parent and teacher attitude: recall events and deeds (the next day), be firm, strong, and to the point Six Constitutional Types of Children Large-headed child: Large head in relation to bodyLarge forehead, cheeksIntrovertedGood concentrationDreamy and imaginativeArtistic To moderate: Rudolf Steiner indicates washing the head and neck with cold water in the morning, and a diet rich in root vegetables sincethese have a, high content of salty substances. However, great care must betaken in the use of salt.121.Small-headed child: Small cranium (often flat) Thin and pale Face is defined Poor concentration, easily distracted Analytical Can be physically agile To moderate: warm towels on abdomen in the evening; a diet rich inleafy vegetables, teas, with lots of sweet nutrients such as figs, honey,dates, and so forth. Cosmic child: Full, round head that is well-formed physically and functionally \"All that is soul and spirit leaves its mark on our head.\" \u2014Steiner The rest of the body appears to lack full penetration of the formative forces Dreamy Not well-coordinated physically Does not like physical activities Good perception Poor in executing and/or concluding a thought process To moderate: needs to feel the form in geometry rather than the beauty; practice walking on balancing beams; need to awaken compassionfor others.122.Earthly child: Forces of heredity work strongly Loves the earth and usually has dirty hands Loves material things like cars, trucks, electronics, and so forth. Loves motionQuite practical but lacks fine motor skills To moderate: needs special, individual attention; must be compelled to draw beautiful and accurate geometric forms; should be encouraged toplay rhythm instruments. Fantasy-rich child: Good memory, in fact, too good; cannot forget Pictures come up involuntarilyEgo cannot bring thoughts under controlFantastic imaging and picture-building capacitiesPowerful imaginations To moderate: can become a prisoner of his/her own ideas and methods\u2014keep him/her fluid; attention on handwriting and painting orany activity that brings him/her into movement. Fantasy-poor child: Weak imaginative forces DryEasily forgets To moderate: must be encouraged to be more observant; consonants must be stressed in speech exercises; the \"I\" needs to be activated; ineurythmy, lots of movements with the arms while standing still.123.The Seven Soul Types The classification of children by temperaments works well up to puberty. It can be dangerous, after this point, to try to categorize the students too rigidly, as most people at this age are a mixture of three or four, withone or two being more dominant. As adulthood dawns, the effect of theego becomes more apparent and things become more complicated. In fact,instead of pure temperament (which does not exist anyway), we have amuch more complex entity. Max Stibbe, in The Seven Soul Types , describes seven predominant dispositions that come forward. Below is a summary. Saturn: Active introvertEgo conscious; serious relationship to lifeNeeds time to work things throughMakes a silent impressionMemory and conscience of a groupGuardian of original resolutionsKeeps view of original aimsCan miss the moment Jupiter: Active balancedCan see solutions to argumentsDecisiveCan be seen as emotionally coolJovial at times Mars: Active extrovertAggressive, dynamic, wants to tackle everything124.Brings life and movement Takes initiativeCan work through the spoken wordDoes not always respect the freedom of othersUnsettled by JupiterPut in place by Venus Sun: Very rareCan be successfulAccompanied by luckNeeds artistic education or withersCan deal with other people; charming, naive, spontaneous, balanced Little personal ambition, hence overestimatedTakes a central position without ruling Venus: PassiveBalanced but more extrovert than introvertAesthetic typeStrong in sympathy and antipathyCan be outspoken, judgmentalCan also judge moral beauty, uglinessCan act as group conscienceMore princess than queen ` Strong sense of inner hygiene125.Mercury: Passive extrovert Mobile, agileCan effectively combine ideas, people, facts-in-chaosGood relationship with mediatorEconomical unoriginal tasteWide interests; not an exact memoryCan be superficialReflects current trends126.127.Encountering the Individuality of a Child by Walter Riethm\u00fcller Waldorf Journal Project #2 Translated from the German by Nina Kuettel An Image of Adoration One can hardly tear oneself away from the enchantment emanating from the crib of a newborn baby. It is what underlies everything that nurtures the child, albeit in different ways. The shepherds kneeled down in humilityto adore it; the kings bowed their heads in reverence; Mary expressed inher posture a gesture of devoted, fulfilled adoration and Joseph one ofreflective meditation. Even we, if we go deeply into the wonder of a birth,cannot resist such a moving impression. What is it then that inwardly seizes us in these moments? It is surely not the reflexively released protective, mother instinct that is supposed tobefall our species when we are confronted with a baby. That is an activityfound with chimpanzee babies, puppies, and kittens, and it is felt to be notonly cute but also human-like and driven by an instinct to protect. It ishardly conceivable that that activity could be the reason shepherds andkings made their way to the cradle of the infant Jesus. The reasons liedeeper than that and are not to be found in the unconscious, vegetativeprocesses and reflexes of our physical bodies. Higher motives apply here:128.the shepherds enthusiastically bringing the news of the healing, world- changing power for the future that was seminally dormant in the child;Joseph considering this mystery; the kings gaining certainty \"from the stars\"that in this child the \"times have been fulfilled\" and that world destinywould work in Him in a special way, and Maria's awakened devotion tothe child\u2014all lend the fleeting moment space and continuity throughspiritual presence. These gestures are thoroughly familiar. Through themthe significance of birth is constantly renewed for us, and they determinethe aura of the encounter between a child and adults. If a certain motif ispreponderant then it is often one-sidedly effectual as a pedagogical program.Such paradigm shifts can be observed in pedagogical history. The Child as a Hope for the Future Foremost, this is the current thought: The newborn, innocent, God- near child is the bearer of hope for a paradisiacal new beginning. It is in a position to be that to which previously born adults did not succeed. But, atleast they do not see the child as having the ability to make improvementsby the child's own powers. Maria Montessori saw the Messiah in everychild: \"But the child always appears again and always returns, fresh andsmiling, to live with human beings. Like Emerson said: 'The child is theeternal Messiah that always returns to fallen human beings to lead theminto the kingdom of heaven.'\" 1 Expectations of the little one's (socially) healing powers permeate the adult's attitude towards the child. Preservationfrom aberrance and contemplation of that which the child hides withinhimself, which is seen as the mystery of our own humanness, are the motifsof an education begun at kindergarten age with extraordinarily positiveeffects. True humanity that is obviously still pristine shows itself in thechild. Here the child is ahead of adults who can learn from him: \"He sawthat his child was ahead of him in many things. And, he was thankful forthis time, the present.\" 2 This enthusiastic, almost religious attitude toward129.the child is robbed of its spiritual motif and comes to us today in the form of senseless catch phrases such as \"children are the future.\" If this thoughtis carried to its consequential end, then it leads to a revaluation of thegenerations; everything can be expected from a child and nothing morecan be expected from adults. And the apparent perceptions of the currentgeneration confirms this. Traditions count for little, experience nothing, theold is devalued and the new is always better (no matter what defects). Howcan an adult still be a role model? The Child as a Genius One has to admit that this attitude of adoration resides in the heavenly regions of the child's being. It becomes more grounded when one begins to concretely observe and search out labels for these forces uponwhich such great hope rests. Obviously, it is just such forces that childrenbring with them that constitute childhood and over which adults no longerhave command, forces that voice hope for the future, zest for life,lightheartedness, joy in movement and variety, over-the-top imagination,speech and thought variations to an unheard of degree, and the capacity tofollow only the living logic of the moment and not yet the abstract thoughtthat is beholden to pure utility. All of these lavishly available qualitiespaint the portrait of a child. Are not here the criteria for ingeniousnessmet? Berthold Otto, a reforming pedagogue, is convinced that \"every child,without exception, is a genius until age six.\" 3 Goethe saw the above indication but was pessimistic about future adulthood, noting that \"ifchildren continued to grow in the manner indicated, then we would havenothing but geniuses.\" 4 Experience shows that somewhere during the transition into school, children reach a threshold that arrests a further overflowing of their surpluslife force, reins in the thinking, and settles lightheartedness. Thisdevelopmental process can be perceived not only in a child's behavior but130.also in the closure and transformation of growth forces that take place with the change of teeth. Here is a licit compliance that distinguishes all livingdevelopment: the attainment of a higher level of consciousness. In childdevelopment, for instance the freeing-up of certain powers of thoughtduring the transition into the seventh year, this attainment of a higher levelof consciousness happens at the expense of overflowing life force. Insteadof posing questions such as, \"Which learning methods are appropriate tothis transition?\" and \"What material would aid here in further development?\" the search is on to find those responsible for the \"disasterin education.\" The guilty party is quickly named: school as a whole. ArturFischer, an inventor, remarked, \"Children are full of ideas. But after a fewyears of school that is all over because they are pressed into a corset thatdoesn't fit.\" Boredom and soul suffocation threaten; school does not preparechildren for life but only makes life known through its hardship. If school can take the most lively thirst for knowledge within a child's soul and suffocate it in boredom, then perhaps justthis is its purpose: to introduce na\u00efvely happy, growingchildren to the disappointments of life. All of the accumulated grievances build, as if by chance, a deep andhard experience. The child enters this stretch of bondage withits own dramatic intensity in order to leave it, injured in away that is hard to understand and armed against all theinjuries to come in the years that follow. . . . And theunforgettably long hardship of school becomes one with thelong hardship of life. \u2014 Giorgio Maganelli, creator of Pinocchio Educational reforms of previous centuries have fed upon this experience and come up with differing approaches. Education \"from out of the child\" always translates into an attempt to rescue childhood forcesand interweave them into the work of the school years, and, at the same131.time, pilot children with these forces intact through the difficulty of learning the material and the alleged seriousness of life. The Child as an Individual Disillusioned and unnerved by the failure of diverse models and curriculum revisions, one can acknowledge that a supporting basis is missing which could give the admittedly inspiring, but diffuse, \"from outof the child\" approach a solid foundation. Then, what childhood actually is can be considered\u2014perhaps it is an adult invention to define its position ofpower\u2014what a child actually is, considered from a legal standpoint or from a family-sociological standpoint. The dilemma of trying to get at theobviously draining reality of school is clouded rather than effectivelyworked through by programmatic paradigms such as lifelong learning orthe call to teach the basics. This observation signifies for the competentinfant, who takes her development into her own hands, relief from theforward look to school, which is unforgiving and paralyzing in its rigidity.The child in general is no longer visible, but rather the individual shinesout from behind this self-powered control. What for decades has beenindicated by experiments and claims that school should functionsimultaneously as an individual learning program can now no longer bedisposed of by alluding to parental egotism. We are obviously dealinghere with an effectuality that did not appear out of nowhere sometimebetween kindergarten and school, but rather was there and individuallyactive from the beginning. The Preschool Years as a Learning Environment The assurance emanating from an infant's active urge to explore and zeal for learning focuses interest anew on preschool development in the hope that here the key to successful learning can be found. If thekindergarten is already seen as being hardly threatened by formal learning,132.then how much less so the first three years of life! Many would like to ascribe everything to these first three years and nothing to later developmentstages. Proponents of early learning programs such as Head Start in NorthAmerica legitimize what they are doing by pointing out the educationalpotential in early childhood. A look at the formation processes of the brainduring this time span (especially nerve cell linkage on a grand scale bysynapses in the outer cortex) reveals potential that, if not engaged within acertain provisional time window, will atrophy. Is this an invitation tounlimited utilization and stimulation of the early childhood urge to exploreso that no resources are lost? This path was quickly trodden. The spirit ofexploration no longer lodges in the shoes of a child, but rather in the baby'sdiapers. 5 \"Instead of peacefully sleeping infants or plump, healthy, apple- cheeked babies, we see slim babies sitting up by themselves; 'competentinfants' contemplatively wrinkling their brows . . .\" 6 The child up to age three and her brain development are understood to be synonymous.7 In the euphoria over astounding feats of learning and toddler competencies,one can overlook differentiating limitations that are critical of the researchmethods (for instance, the lack of long-term studies on childhood up toyouth and the uncritical application to humans of certain statements aboutrat brain changes). Acceptance of a fundamental brain plasticity, with itsattendant possibility for life-long learning, is something of a hindrance toearly childhood advancement as stylized by experts! However, theseimportant indications break through the protective encirclement of thecradle during early learning programs. The kindergarten years revealthemselves to be the period when it should to have what schools must bekept from if they remain as they are: A field of social experimentation andan Eldorado for the joy of discovery. Time for experimentation, time for mistakes, for practice and repetition\u2014the kindergarten offers all of these things as well as afundamental introduction to the natural sciences, language and art. In133.kindergarten the world can become a laboratory, a studio, or a workshop for the children, or a forest, or the moon.8 Donata Elschenbroich in of Seven-Year-Olds ) enthusiastically speaks about the variety of possibilities suitable for today's children when children's desire for lifeexperience is met as detailed in her concept of preschool/kindergarten.This is unlike formal schooling's depressing threshold where this desirefor experience is not met. Who would not want to be in a kindergartenwhere foreign languages are delved into through songs and games andwhere children are animated to sing, speak, dance, and move throughrhyme, tone, and rhythmic speech and music? Who would not want toenjoy painting and be where beginning attempts to write are honored andled into suitable written correspondence without being tied to a right orwrong? And where, without competion, regard for the achievements ofother children is instilled as is the ability to forgive? To have time for\"mistakes, for practice, for repetition\u2014the kindergarten offers all thesethings.\" Elschenbroich's book has five pages of suggestions, and there one finds obvious but almost forgotten provocative ideas about what a seven-year-old child could or should experience, for instance, seesawing, a pillowfight, cooking with Dad, woodwork, making a bed, cleaning, making butter,whipping cream, elementary care of the sick or injured to get a feeling forthe fact that the world changes, send and receive mail, learn curse words intwo languages, use the telephone, and basic concepts of what the computercan do, and so forth. Some suggestions are thoroughly questionable andshould be rejected. For instance, there is no rationale for having computersin the kindergarten. This comes from a passing comment that children arecompletely capable of handling this technology. However, the mostimpressive thing is her attitude towards the child. The child is takenseriously in his originality and his subjugation to childhood.134.Reverence for the Individuality The kindergarten fails as a bearer of hope when the reality of school does not honor children's world knowledge. Elschenbroich's impulse comes to a standstill when it encounters this depressing experience, and here itbecomes evident that pedagogy is indivisible. Experience tells us that, above all, education in many of today's schools takes away the motives to gainworld knowledge and stands in obstructive opposition to the child whoexpects and needs motivation, encouragement, and enhancement. This lackof reverence for childhood forces, suited to the state-regulated school system,can only be reversed when the puzzle of child individuality is not exhaustedby genetic programming. In that respect, one must more exactly andseriously ask the question of \"where does the child come from?\" In Greek philosophy the soul is in a process that runs through three phases of reintegration (metoikesis)\u2014preexistence, existence, and post-existence. Unfortuantely, the knowledge of preexistence has fallen awayfrom humankind. In this regard Sloterdijk spoke of a birth-oblivion. It istime to come to grips with this consciously suppressed reality because wecan imagine what \"could be learned and developed about depth ofunderstanding for oneself and others, a comprehensive humanization, withthat kind of expanded memory.\" 9 This is also the central motif of the pedagogy of Rudolf Steiner. In Waldorf education the individuality does not exhaust itself in living in thehere and now, but rather Waldorf education considers the experiences thatthe individuality of the child brings with him from his preexistence, revealedin the form of abilities and life impulses. With an attitude that looks onlyto the future and to what one would like to attain with the child, one cannotdo justice to the child's own life intentions. No justice is done with an attitudeof one being simply at an observation post where much is seen and littlenoted. Trusting in the genius of the moment seems too risky within all oflife's changes.135.Rudolf Steiner gave to Waldorf teachers a meditation with three attitudes to prepare for encounters with children: \"Reverence for the child's being that existed before birth; enthusiastically pointing toward that whichwill succeed the child; protective activism for that which the childexperiences.\" 10 For a long time now, Waldorf education has not been alone with these motifs but they are still not a matter of course, having been onlysomewhat introduced into modern school practice. The rediscovery of theimportance of the first seven years has opened up a more general willingnessby non-Waldorf educators to confront uncomfortable questions that cannotbe answered by reductionistic experiments. Pedagogical events andprograms should be waived in order to make room for the needs of eachchild's individuality. There is a cosmos of childhood experiences and actionsthat \"no child psychologist or pedagogue has ever been able to measure.Namely, a realm of competence that belongs to the child, is self-created, trodden, and ruled by the child. We can only be visitors who wonder atand enter with reverence this realm and who hold within the echo of our adulthoods those conditions perceived as positive by the children. We can only be those who protect this realm from insubordinate intrusions (fromsexual violence to pedagogical functionalization) and at the same time leadthe children into new connections of discovery through an encouraging setting-free resulting in an expansion of their competence.\" 11 The attitudes that make isolated appearances in the Christmas motifs, referred to at the beginning of this article find their spiritual synthesisin the encounter between Mary and the Child. The encounter betweenmother and child reveals a gaze that utters the knowledge that everymoment one is facing the full individuality that fatefully joins past, present,and future.136.Footnotes: 1 Montessori, Maria.

The young child is an unwritten page, a \"tabula rasa,\" or an imperfect being, \"weak and helpless, without knowledge or understanding,\" as the English philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) put it. In his Second Treatise on Government, Locke outlined the duty of parents: \"To inform the mind and govern the actions of their yet ignorant nonage [offspring] till reason shall take its place and ease them of that trouble is what the children want and what the parents are bound to.\"1 In Locke's view, the task of parent and educator is to fill up the empty page of the child's mind with everything a responsible adult may reasonably be required to know or be able to do. Nor is the child, it seems, a being whose entire maturation and development is contained within it, as Jean-Jacques Rousseau discussed in 1762 in Emile or Concerning Education . The book opened with, \"God makes all things good; man meddles with them and they becomes evil.\"2 Yet education is necessary, Rousseau continued; without it \"prejudice, authority,necessity, example, all the social conditions into which we are plunged138.would stifle nature in him [the child] and put nothing in her place. He would be like a sapling chance sown in the midst of the highway, sent hither and thither and soon crushed. . . . [R]emove this young tree from the highway and shield it from the crushing force of social conventions.\" According to Rousseau, the task of education is not to inculcate morals and social values but to allow nature to bring forth what slumbersin the soul of the individual. Parents should protect the unfolding individual from all impressions emanating from the human environment that might hinder the child's development, and they should surround the child\u2014but not smother him\u2014with a warm embrace of love. The ideal mother was the devoted figure of Sophie, Emile's patient, devoted wife. The idealenvironment was Rousseau's idealized bourgeois family, no longer held together, as in the Middle Ages, by economic, dynastic, or feudal bonds, but by love alone. In our century, the nature of the human being and in particular the nature of child development has continued, like Foucault's pendulum, toendlessly revolve in a swing of opinion. Recently, discussion has focused on language acquisition, moving between various versions of the nativitist and behavioralist positions\u2014that is, behavior is either inborn or learned. Currently, consensus seems to have settled for the hard-wired or innate, genetically pre-programmed theory of language acquisition. The matter isfar from resolved, however, since factors such as timing, language environment, encouragement, and social interaction all clearly play important roles. Most recent research points to a combination of inborn predispositions and social circumstances. Above all, language acquisition and general learning both involve far more active participation of the childthan was hitherto thought necessary. The Active Individuality Perhaps the single most important discovery of modern psychology is the recognition that children are highly active in the process of learning.139.Between inborn predispositions and adaptations on the one hand and cultural, environmental inf1uences on the other, there emerges a third factor, the individuality of the child. This individuality is the active agent in the process of learning, active from the beginning. In early childhood, this individuality expresses itself less through self-consciousness and more through the unconscious will-forces in activity.We see this will-activity in the urge to raise the head and the trunk and in the whole stretching process that culminates in standing upright. It comes to expression in the attention the infant gradually directs to the world around him, and especially in the effort to make contact with the mother and other people in the child's environment. And this happens long before languagemakes verbal communication possible. It is this core of individuality around which memory forms, and it is, of course, this same core of being that comes to self-consciousness. Anthroposophy calls this individuality the \"I\" or ego. As Rudolf Steiner put it: \"Essentially everything which comes into our consciousness does so through the 'I.' The 'I' is that which connects us toour environment.\" 3 Steiner's understanding of development differs then from both nativitist and behaviorist approaches in that in his approach the \"I\" actively individualizes what is inherited and responds in individual and unpredictable ways to what comes towards the child from the cultural andphysical environments. In both cases, it is the activity of the \"I\" that is decisive in relating the being of the child to his body and genetic inheritance and to the circumstances of his upbringing. Thus, we can see that in this sense the bearer of individuality, the \"I,\" is central to the processes of both maturation and learning. Associatedwith the emergence of self-consciousness around the age of three years old, the \"I\" is also active in the child long before. The \"I\" is by its nature active\u2014 it could be termed the \"I-activity.\" We must reckon not only with the conscious activity of the \"I\" in the learning child but also with its140.unconscious activity. Both before the age of three and after, the \"I-activity\" is at work within unconscious organic processes as well as in the unconscious levels of the mind, and specifically during sleep. The \"I\" is active within regenerative processes and above all in the processing of the daily's sense experiences. This activity of sorting, digesting, and assimilating linguistic and other impressions is as vital for language and cognitivedevelopment as it is for psychological orientation. We can understand why Steiner said it is through the \"I\" that the individual relates to the world. Until recently it was thought that most early childhood behavior consisted of genetically determined reflexes gradually overlaid with layers of culturally imposed patterns of reaction and response. We now knowthat, far from being unwritten pages or bundles of reflexes, babies are active in creating learning situations through interaction with those around them. They seek social contact, can maintain it once engaged, and can even end it when they need to. Research on infants has shown that babies as early as six days old can imitate gestures such as sticking out a tongue without having anyconsciousness that they have a tongue let alone knowledge of how to control it. They can select sense impressions that have meaning for them\u2014such as the sound of their mother's voice played on a tape\u2014when they are two weeks old. At three months, they can learn through trial and error to masterthe voluntary movement of their limbs, such as sharpening the focus of a projected image by varying the strength of suction on a wired-up dummy, or operating a mobile attached by a ribbon to one foot. 4 These facts would remain anecdotal curiosities were it not that their explanation presents uswith a challenge and one not merely of academic interest. In understandingthese phenomena, we define the nature of human beings, which in turn determines our approach to education, and much else besides. We can put it down to pre-programmed responses, but that philosophical position is demonstrably unsustainable by the evidence of our experience as parents141.and educators. What precludes the possibility of total hardwiring is the part played by the child's own activity. The Sociable Baby Babies are above all characterized by their sociability. They have a clear preference for faces and face-like shapes, and they can quickly distinguish the human voice from other sounds. It is particularly in social contact and communication that young children show active initiative in engaging their parents and siblings in interactive exchange. They seem to want to communicate and have a compelling effect on others. It is hard to resist speaking to a baby even though we know that she does not yet havethe ability to vocalize any response. In no time at all we are using voice, facial expression, and gesture to set up a meaningful exchange. 5 And it is precisely this two-way web of feedback and interaction that is so vital forlearning. What begins with stimulating milk-flow in the mother's breast through suckling, and continues with the search for eye contact, becomes apervasive powerful and flexible general endeavor to find learning situations. Hand in hand with the complexities of physiological maturation, such as the brain's rapid growth and later motor control, goes the exploration of soul life. Between the ages of seven and nine months, the baby learns torespond to the mother's feelings. When the mother looks on encouragingly, the child feels able to go on exploring the room. If, however, the mother has a serious expression, the child will stop exploring and return to her. For a child's developing abilities, parental reactions are essential in reinforcing the emerging sense of self. Development in this sense is, as the Americanpsychologist Daniel Stern puts it, \"a task which children and parents have to master together.\" 6 On the whole, adults seem to be aware of this in that they usually respond to the demands of children in helpful ways\u2014unless they place142.them in front of a television screen, which does not respond to the child's searching need for feedback and interaction, as Dr. Sally Ward's research at the Speech, Language and Hearing Center has shown.7 Adults apparently approach babies and seek eye contact at exactly the appropriate distance\u2014around seven inches\u2014the optimal distance for infant eyes. Likewise most parents seem to know intuitively how to judge the fine line betweendemanding too much and too little in play with their children. In language learning too, parents assist their children by speaking more slowly and by careful repetition of basic linguistic constructions including grammatical variation when appropriate. Parents often use extremely subtle methods of supporting language development, forexample, by creating highly structured and ritual linguistic situations in which language becomes predictable in a familiar context, such as at the supper table, during dressing, or bedtime. This is described by Jerome Bruner as scaffolding , a termed coined to denote the parent's role in supporting language development. 8 Most parents do not correct mistakes directly, such as adults would do to each other when learning a foreignlanguage, but rather reiterate what the child said by way of confirmation but using the correct form: Child: \"I eated up all my mu-lee.\"Parent: \"Yes, you ate up all your muesli. Can you eat up all your bread too?\" The ideal scaffolding situation, according to Bruner, is when the parent isin tune with the child's developmental level and therefore talks in a way that demands linguistic skills that are always a bit beyond what the child is currently doing, but not beyond his reach. This corresponds to Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky's concept of \"zones of proximal development.\" 9 Vygotsky said that there are two143.measures of what a child's cognitive ability is in any given situation: what the child can achieve without help and what the child could achieve with the help or instruction of an adult or more competent peer. The distance between these two levels of ability is the zone of proximal development. Vygotsky argued that what the child can do with help at one stage, she will be able to do on her own at a later developmental stage. Social frameworkand intrapersonal achievement are vital for child development and learning. As Susan Engel has shown in her comprehensive book The Stories Children Tell, Making Sense of the Narratives of Childhood , The input of the \"other\"\u2014in many cases, a parent\u2014is central to understanding what the child can do and is learning todo. Family interactions may not only be the context in whichchildren's thinking develops; they may also help shape howthe child thinks. 10 Interaction between parent and child is a part of the process of linguistic and cognitive development, especially if parents are receptive of the child's needs. Nowhere is this more true than in that archetypal human activity, storytelling. The Meaning of the Story It was Gordon Wells, in his seminal book The Meaning Makers, who identified the importance of storytelling not only for language but also for cognitive development. Based on the Bristol, England, study \"Language atHome and at School,\" a longitudinal project involving children from the earliest acquisition of language through primary school, Wells' research highlighted the importance of stories as a preparation for literacy. Stories, he concluded, were better than other methods for several reasons. Firstly, in listening to stories, children can \"gain an experience ofthe sustained meaning-building organization of written language, and its characteristic rhythms and structures.\" 11 Secondly, stories extend the range144.of the child's experience beyond her actual life circumstances. Thirdly, stories provide an excellent opportunity for the kind of collaborative talk between adult and child that helps children understand the world and stimulates the child's inner dialogues. This self-talk forms a key stage in the development of independent thinking. What Wells said concerning written stories also goes for oral stories that are either told from memory or made up spontaneously. I feel the child'sperception of the thought processes involved in telling rather than reading a story are more direct. Of course, the written story may have more consciously structured form; it may have high intrinsic artistic merit, but the thought processes involved are more removed. Unprepared readingmay cloud the inherent literary structure through inappropriate emphasis on sentence structure. At a more advanced stage of literacy, the child will be able to recreate the vivid story pictures by reading on her own. In the young child, then, the perception of the story-telling activity is a complex one involving the observation of gesture, facial expression, hearing andword recognition, and perception of an individual's thought and imaginative processes at work. All these elements are inseparable from the story content itself. At an early stage, stories should be told from memory. Parents often notice how relating the most mundane stories, in effect merely recountingthe day's events, will be listened to with rapt attention by young children. Children have an intense interest in how adults organize sequential events in narrative form. The child's na\u00efve unreflected attention may perceive cognitive processes in what the adult says. The child can learn\u2014through assimilation and imitation\u2014from perceptions to which older children oradults need no longer pay attention. A child must learn the symbolic value of language to eventually be able to grasp the abstraction of reading and writing alphabet letters, comprehending qualities symbolized by numbers, and so on throughout145.the curriculum. Meaning is communicated by context on the one hand and by imitation on the other. If something has meaning for an adult, the child will assume meaning for that word or symbol. A story gives context; it is imbued with personal meaning by the teller. Thus, hearing stories enables a child to grasp the symbolic value of language before having to cope with the added abstraction of writing. Understanding through narrative helps children organize their experiences, describe events, and follow instructions. Most importantly,children who have become used to hearing and expressing themselves in narrative form can more easily understand adults' language. Such children can understand when they hear about things not present in the room andperhaps quite outside their life experience, a classroom factor as teachers tend increasingly to talk about other lands, other times, and other peoples. 12 In order to direct their own thought processes, children must be able to use symbols and relate them to their own direct experience. As Wells put it, Stories have a role in education that goes far beyond their contribution to the acquisition of literacy. Constructingstories in the mind\u2014or storying, as it has been called\u2014isone of the most fundamental means of making meaning; as such, it is an activity that pervades all aspects of learning. 13 Storytelling is probably as old as human culture and certainly as old as language in the form we know it today. The heritage of each culture, including the sum of its knowledge about the world, and its technical achievements as well as its worldview have traditionally been preserved in its oral story traditions. To a large extent cultures define themselvesthrough the sacred stories they tell in ritual circumstances. A fine example of this is the Songlines of the Aborigines, which relate the narrative biography of the landscape and its relationship to the people.146.Literate cultures have incorporated their values in sacred texts, which are read at significant moments in the annual cycle. Most such texts are in narrative form and describe the journey of the soul, as in the Egyptian Book of the Dead or the Tibetan Book of the Dead, or record the history of the people. Modern cultures continue to record what society deems valuable, using books and now electronic technology. However, the principles remainthe same. Even scientific facts are told in narrative form; otherwise they would be incomprehensible 14 to most readers. Stories provide a meaningful interpretation of those aspects of human experience seen as fundamentaland of abiding concern. What is so essential about narrative? What makesnarrative? What is in a story? Narrative Structure Jerome Bruner has characterized narrative as follows. Narrative must have sequence. Narrative must have a plot, a sequence that conveys meaning. Narrative must have a high point, a tension that meets some kind of resolution. A narrative may be true or not. It is indifferent to facts. A narrative distinguishes between the usual and the unusual. A narrative directs attention to personal or subjective experience. 15 Implicit in this characterization is the fact that narrative uses formal, even ritualized forms for describing the world. It also implies a speaker- listener relationship that is dynamic rather than passive. The meaning is enhanced by context\u2014including background information assumed to beknown to both storyteller and listener. For that reason a mere list of events does not constitute a narrative because it has not been constructed with a147.particular listener in mind, nor has the list been constructed with any particular meaning in mind other than face value. It is often the sequence that imbues the events with a particular meaning, as does what is left out of the account. According to speech-act theory,16 telling stories is a kind of doing, an action which has three components: the actual story as it is told, whatthe speaker intended to achieve with the story, and the effect the story has on the listener. This framework enables us to see how storytelling by and for children can involve active social and conceptual interaction. A story can provide the pretext for establishing, clarifying, or changing relationships. Stories can help form bonds, resolve conflicts, and share experience as wellas provoke, annoy, or attract attention. What is told can often be quite secondary to how and to whom. Stories as speech acts are particularly important for pre-school children in play. Narrative structure can provide a basic plot, which enables the children to take roles in a play situation. If they are playing doctors, onechild can be the doctor, the other the mother with the sick child (\"and then let's say the mummy goes to the doctor and the little girl says, 'I feel really sick,' I'll be the little girl and you be the doctor, okay?\"). This plot generates sequences of play with dialogue and includes narrative parts (\"then she gives the mummy some pills and writes in a book\"). Young children spend a lot of time and energy in collaborative storytelling in which role-playing is highly varied and complex. Throughsuch stories they not only learn to socially interact, they learn to organize their experience and what they know and also learn how to communicate that knowledge to others. We Are the Stories We Tell Stories not only help children give meaning to their worlds, improve their listening, verbal, and literacy skills; they also, as Engel has shown148.evocatively in her study of children's narrative, help children construct their identities. Children are the stories they tell. Stories not only reconstruct and communicate experience, they are experience. As Engel puts it: But a central reason it is so important to understand all these whats and hows of storytelling is that the stories play a vitalrole in shaping children's sense of themselves and theirpresentation of that self to others. 17 Engel notes that a developmental line runs through the stories children tell, from the simplest \"I did this . . .\" kind to the elaborate stories that children of eight or nine years old make up. Through the stories children tell about themselves in the past or the future (\"I'm going to make a sword and chop up that monster . . .\") emerges a sense of extended self, which includes both enduring and transient aspectsof their personality. The stories map out a region\u2014the child's inner home base and the areas of its surroundings\u2014that the child has explored. The details may be imaginary or real. In fact, in young children the imagination may even be more compelling than objective outer reality. The world of \"I want to be\" is as important in defining a sense of self as \"this is what I am.\"Of course for an adult to have a sense of self largely defined by imagination could be psychologically risky. The healthy transformation of this would be a set of ideals one strives to realize. Adults may appropriately define themselves by the ideals and sense of truth they bear within them. 18 In both children and adults, it is the \"I\" as core of the individual's being that clothes itself in the garments of the extended self. The \"I\" itselfremains invisible\u2014in the sense that a person's self becomes visible to us when we get to know them\u2014though we can recognize it through its activity. The content of such narratives helps to define and give expression to the child's being. What is vitally important to the child is the child's ownperception of that being, the perception of self. Children gain this perception in and through their relationships to the world and to other people. \"I went149.in the shop with daddy and this big dog was there!\" It is essential for the child to tell her story to a listening person who can respond in an affirmative, participatory way. The story will need to be told several times until the encounter with the dog has become a shared and assimilated experience. Throughout this process, the child is able to gain a perception of herself in relation to a specific experience and through the eyes of another. Stories and Drawings Just as young children's drawings19 unconsciously reveal something of the dynamic process of the inner being of the child coming to terms with and mastering the physical organism, so too in a similar way do stories.Children's drawings express the sense of bodily well-being, balance,orientation, and co-ordination of the body in space, and this is true whateverthe child's professed intentions may be. In this sense their linear qualityexpresses the unconscious forces of the will and their use of color is thesoul's response to bodily experience. In a nutshell one could say that thechild's drawing shows to what extent the child feels at home in his body. Stories, however, reveal another realm of the child's whole being, less that of the motor-will activity and more of the linguistic-cognitive part of the soul. Stories express how the child understands the circumstances ofhis life and relationships. It is, of course, artificial to separate the cognitive from the motoric will, especially in the young child. The two realms are closely integrated at that age. It is the feeling realm of the soul, the middle, that is the source of both drawing and storying. Nevertheless, I suggest that the child's feeling life responds to the bodily-organic sense of his ownbeing through the expression of movement and drawing, whereas storying and speech generally are more conscious and therefore a reflection of the cognitive pole. What is fascinating is when a child first draws a picture, a self-contained activity, and then engages an adult to relate its story. The educator must use both drawing and storying as diagnostic tools.150.Collaborative Learning Through the process of narrative construction, children can reflect on themselves in the present, in relation to themselves in the past or future. This involves dialogue and exchange. The child needs to hear, and often, the adult's own version of events: \"Do you remember we went down the garden and peeped into the little birdie's nest?\" Following this, the childneeds to construct the narrative herself on the basis of the adult's scaffolding. This way the child gains a two-way perspective of himself in and through the story. Actually, it is usually three-way, since there is an adult's version, the child's version, and the collective \"we\" in the form of a dialogue, with both parent and child taking turns recounting the event, possibly to a thirdparty. Many psychologists have used storying with adult patients in therapy to recast the story of their lives. In telling the story from a slightly different perspective, patients can change the way they see themselves or their relationships to others. This points to the fact that when we tell a storyabout ourselves, we become an object that we can relate to or simply contemplate from another point of view. This provides an inner perspective. The way we represent ourselves in stories and the way stories shape us varies as we develop. Engel's Five Phases of Narative Engel describes five childhood phases of narrative used by children to develop a sense of the self. The first phase involves children gaining an initial sense of self by participating in the stories their parents tell about them. They learn that they can be both subject and object of events in theworld. While still dependent on adults and older siblings, children begin the second phase around the age of three when they develop sufficient personal memory to describe their own past experiences. As Engel puts it, \"Parents have become vital partners in describing past experiences to fill151.out their children's sense of themselves over time.\"20 Parents not only provide support, they influence the process in other important ways: When children tell stories about their past to and with their parents, not only do the parents' specific contributions helpshape the content of those stories, but their role as audienceaffects what children put into the story. The child may includedetails that will please a parent, attract his attention, orprovoke him. The child's sense of his listener will end upinfluencing what goes into the story anyhow it gets told.Ultimately, that story will contribute to the child's inner senseof self. 21 The third phase sees children between four and five expanding their circle of conversation partners to include peers. These kindergarteners increasingly learn through feedback from their playmates during play. Initially three- and four-year-olds tend to talk to each other while playing; by the age of five, they tend to talk more about what they are going to play. Between the ages of six and seven, they spend most of their time telling each other about what they like and dislike and exchanging stories,especially common experiences: \"Remember when we made that hideaway.\" This helps form social bonds and strengthens the sense of identity. Not to share in the memory challenges a child's sense of personalized past. Engels describes the fourth phase as the increasing ability to hold different ideas in the mind at the same time and the ability to return againat intervals to certain topics and themes. Earlier the child has been far more bound to present experience and the circumstances of the immediate environment. Engel writes: Whereas two-year-olds use stories to understand the social world contained in their immediate family life, children ofseven, eight, and nine years old use collections of stories and152.ongoing sagas to penetrate the complexities of the expanded world in which they are now active. The fifth phase sees storytelling dwindling. There is less at home or school. Engel suggests that what is retained is the repertoire of stories/ memories that we use to give friends and new acquaintances a certain picture of ourselves. What does seem clear in my observation of adolescents is that storytelling becomes internalized. Children speak to themselves whenthey are engaged in some concentrated activity. In order to remember the sequences or stages in a complex process they have not quite mastered, they use self-talk and later internalize this in the form of thought. A similar situation occurs with the identity reinforcement of storytelling. Speech becomes internalized thought, and storytelling withdraws into innermemories, dreams, and reflections (in C. G. Jung's autobiography). Literature, of course, is the other outcome of the storytelling development of childhood. One assumes that Dostoyevsky, Dickens, Ben Okri, and Kate Atkinson all started off as infant storytellers. As Ben Okri writes in Aphorisms and Fragments : It is in the creation of story, the lifting of story into the realms of art, it is in this that the higher realms of creativity reside.. . . It is easy to forget how mysterious and mighty storiesare. They do their work in silence, invisible. They work withall the internal materials of the mind and self. They becomepart of you while changing you. Beware the stories you reador tell, subtly, in the night, beneath the waters of consciousness, they are altering your world. 22 Conclusions Given the importance of storytelling for child development, points worth remembering include:153.1. Certain features of linguistic development appear to be universal. These include the tendency of children by the age of three years to sequence their experience whendescribing it. They talk about what happened and thenwhat happened next. This is the first prerequisite fornarrative. By the age of five years most children havemastered the other prerequisites of narrative, place andtime. They can say when and where it happened. Whenchildren recall events they usually have an opening, ahigh point, and an ending. 2. Children adopt the storytelling characteristics of their culture. In all cultures children \"learn to tell stories inorder to become full participants in their community andto develop relationships with other people, as much asthey do to formulate experience for themselves. 23 3. Stories are crucial to cognitive development and in the child's developing relationship to self and the world. 4. Children's capacity to tell stories becomes increasingly individual. 5. Storytelling may be an inborn predisposition but it requires from the beginning willing, enthusiastic, and skilledpartners. Parents and educators need to value children'sstories by responding to them in appropriate ways. We needa phenomenology of stories, and we need to train ourobservational skills to recognize their qualities. 6. Teachers in kindergarten and elementary school (though this is far more likely in elementary school) need to avoidstifling the storytelling habits of children through formaland informal instruction and correction. School teachersmust find ways of encouraging rather than hindering thestorytelling process. Wells writes that many schoolsituations limit linguistic development and learninggenerally because of what he terms the \"transmissional\"concept of teaching. 24154.It is not possible., simply by telling, to cause students to come to have the knowledge that is in the mind of the teacher. Knowledge cannot be transmitted. It has to be constructed afresh by each individual knower on the basis of what is already known and by means of strategies developed over the whole of that individual's life, both inside and outside of the classroom.25 Bearing this in mind and taking account of the need for an interactive learning relationship, a number of factors limit learning opportunities. Theseinclude too much frontal teaching, in which the teacher does most of the talking, and groups which are too large for individual children to have the opportunity of interactive conversation of the kind needed to develop skillsand further understanding. Also, too little allowance is made for individual children's abilities and experiences. Learning becomes passive when there is too much emphasis on the teacher's lesson plan and too little emphasis on where the individual child is\u2014that is, building lessons on what the children know in a given situation. Wells stresses the necessity of activeinvolvement of children in their own learning. He points out that too many teachers fall back on the \"being talked at\" style by which they were educated. What Wells terms collaborative teaching methods activates the child's own learning activity. In anthroposophical terms, one speaks of engaging the child's \"I\" or ego. The engagement of the \"I\" is at risk where outcomes are too rigidly defined in the curriculum and teaching methods are used that deliver theseoutcomes as \"efficiently\" as possible. Rather, in education, the journey is always its own reward. This method of teaching does not imply that the teacher become redundant or relinquish responsibility for guiding learning situations, farfrom it. In fact a collaborative partnership between child and teacher is a great art, requiring considerable professional expertise. In a Waldorf school, most teachers would see partnership with the young child as being with155.the \"I\" of the child, the child's higher being. The teacher, of course, converses with the child but the collaboration as such consists in recognizing what the \"I\" of the child is communicating. As the child becomes more mature, that dialogue increasingly needs to become direct and verbal. 7. Engel identifies two ways teachers neglect or stifle the developmental potential of storytelling: an overemphasis on correctness and logic at the expense of the child's impulse toconvey personal meaning and not taking what children haveto tell us seriously, seeing the child's inventions as childish. 8. The role of the listener is an active, creative one. This means not only encouragement but appropriate responses.Storytelling is a collaborative process. In order to collaboratewe have to enter into the story. It is no good asking questionsoutside of the framework of the story or introducing yourown, different story. 9. Children need to experience a variety of styles of storytelling using different genres. Engel gives revealingadvice: \"We tend to reserve great stories and poems until wethink children are old enough to appreciate them. Instead,assume that if they start hearing beautiful language, well-constructed narratives, and different genres early in life, theywill acquire a vocabulary of narrative in the same way thatthey seem so easily to acquire a vocabulary of words.\" Thisaccords with basic practice in Waldorf schools. 10. Allow children to read, hear, and write stories about the things that concern them. This includes things from whichwe usually try to shield children. It is better that they retellthe story of some television crime series than repress theexperience. The beauty of stories is that we can change themin the retelling and, in so doing, we can change ourrelationship to them. It may sound trite but it is good to talk and even better to listen!156._________________________ Footnotes: 1 Locke, J., Second Treatise of Government , Chapter VI, para 56 and 58, pp32- 33, 1952. 2 Rousseau, J., Emile, Everyman edition, p5, 1974. 3 Steiner, R., Lecture October 9, 1918 in GA.182. 4 Kindheit und Jugend.(23/95).

Rudolf Steiner already pointedthis out at the beginning of the Study of Man like a prelude to the founding of the first Waldorf school. 1 At the same time, the task of fathoming a connection between daily experience and nighttime sleep was put forwardin order to fructify our teaching practice. Especially the rhythmicphenomena of the nightly rest period exhibits impressive characteristicsthat together with the background of various indications by Rudolf Steinerare very interesting and motivating. Hansjoerg Hofrichter pointed out suchphenomena in an article in Erziehungskunst in May, 1994. 2 The state of sleep is not a passive giving up of oneself. It is actively initiated.3 The fact that we can, today, by reason of observations made on people sleeping, describe the various states of sleep has been adequatelydocumented. Aristotle circa 350 B.C. identified the phases of rapid eye158.movement that are associated with dreaming. What is remarkable is the rhythmically swinging immersion into the various observable states of sleep.Measurement of electrical brain activity by an EEG gives an exact delineationof the physiological processes. The Physiological Phases of Sleep When falling asleep, the frequency of measurable current changes from 8 to 12 Hz. (the so-called alpha waves) to the beta waves of 13 to 40 Hz. In a second phase, these beta waves are superposed by isolateddeflections in order to then finally be replaced by the slow delta waves(approximately 3 Hz.) in the third phase of sleep. The actual deep sleepthat has the slowest electrical brain activity of one wave per second, the so-called \"slow wave sleep\" (SWS) begins after approximately 20 minutes.When it appears for the first time at night it can last up to 30 minutes.However, we reach this state of sleep only two, or three times during aseven- to eight-hour rest period and then only in the beginning of the sleepperiod. In phases three and four, growth hormones in the blood plasma rise markedly. During experimentation people were purposely wakened at thebeginning of this phase of deep sleep and only allowed to experience theother phases, complained of strong physical indisposition and had markeddifficulties with kinesthesia the next day. After the fourth phase (about 50 minutes), the \"way back\" through the other phases begins and lasts about 20 minutes. Then begins the phaseof so-called \"paradox sleep.\" This REM sleep, so named because of theobservable rapid eye movement (REM), is apparent through significantincrease in bodily functions. The heart rate increases for a short time andfluctuates between 50 and 90 beats per minute during the entire REM phase.Breathing becomes faster and more irregular. The body hardly moves. Evenmuscle tension that otherwise prevents the lowering of body temperature159.is suspended during this time. At the same time, eye movement behind closed lids can be detected. The delicate muscles of the middle ear, whichserve in the selection of certain sound phenomena, also become active. We always experience our dreams during this phase even if later we cannot remember them. Even though the brain's electrical frequency(beta waves) clearly indicates that the person is in a state of light sleep, it ishard to awaken that person during this time. If, by certain purposefulinterventions, this paradox sleep is prevented for extended periods of time,the person taking part in the experiment often complains of psychicaldisturbances. The person feels tense and irritable, displays aggressivebehavior, anxiety, suspicion, and possibly experiences significant memorylapse. There are indications that the REM phase benefits the consolidationof memories. After this episode we can wake-up for a short time and then we begin the nightly journey anew. The entire journey, from falling asleep tothe first REM phase, lasts on average about 90 minutes and consists of thesefour parts each of about the same time duration: immersion, phases one to three, about 20 minutes long deep sleep, phase four, about 30 minutes long with the tendency to become shorter with each passage the return, phases three to one in reverse order, about 20 minutes long paradox or REM sleep, about 20 minutes long with the tendency to lengthen with each passage. In the first half of the night, deep sleep occurs only twice while the length of time of REM sleep continually increases until it reaches 40% in the morning. It is significant that the cycle described varies little between individuals. So it is that with people who normally sleep only a short time,the portion of deep sleep is increased\u2014and with long sleepers, above all,160.the length of phase two is extended. For the rest, the pattern of a five-time upswing and downswing lasting approximately 90 minutes each appliesfor all adults. The entire curve that we complete by repeated immersioninto the world of sleep is marked by a slow decline in body temperature ofabout 0.55 C during a period that lasts about five hours ending with an increase in body temperature. Dream Images and Their Preparation Dreams during the REM phase are only accessible to our memory in full when we awaken immediately after this phase. Often they appear addled and seem to have no connection to the previous day's experiences.The fact that small children have especially extended dreamtime showsthat the content of consciousness that comes about is, at first, hardlydetermined by the physical world. In total, the percentage of REM sleepwith newborns is about 50% (16 hours of sleep) at its highest point and 161.then sinks to about 18.5% with a 12-year-old child. It then increases once again to 22% with young adults and finally, little by little, to just 13.5%with the aged. 4 Rudolf Steiner also described how the quality of dreams change: Dreams of the small child still reveal the creative energy that comes from the spiritual world and is active in the physicalbody, as opposed to adults where dream content is confusedand must, upon awakening, be inserted into a space/timeorder by the physical body. 5 Access to the dream world of the small child is unequivocally lost. Only through their own efforts can adults come close to the active, spiritualhierarchies during sleep. 6 Just as dreams are the domain of the small child only older children and adults are in a position to carry reminiscences of waking life into theworld of sleep. 7 This apparently happens during the phases of deep sleep. In other words, it has been shown that not only during REM sleep doesconsciousness content come about that can be remembered. Sleep-trialsubjects who were awakened during slow wave sleep could report on sleepexperiences that did not originate from a previous REM phase. Suchexperiences were, however, much more strongly built upon orderedelements of the previous day's experiences. The impression arises that the subsequent dream experiences are in some way prepared in the deep sleep phases. Waking experiences are carriedinto the depths of the spiritual world while during REM sleep images canarise that emanate from the creative energies of the spiritual world.However, we normally see only the after-images of our earthly life mirroredthat we have ourselves painted into our dream phases. The physiological process of sight inverts itself in dream images. With cats it has been determined how in a waking state the movement of162.gaze follows an outer light stimulus followed by an electrical impulse in the corpus geniculatum of the brain; only then does the seen image appear on the optical cortex. During a dream, the opposite occurs. The impulse tothe corpus geniculatum happens first followed by the movement of gaze. The image comes about in reverse order\u2014from the inside to the outside.The decisive moment at which it is possible for daily happenings to becarried into the dream world occurs with the freeing-up of the etheric bodyat the beginning of the change of teeth. Only so far as the child is already ina position to carry his or her earthly experiences during waking life into hisor her nightly world is that child approachable through Waldorf education. And just as much as comes in from the earthly world during sleep containing nothing more of the world beyond, exactlyin that measure, is the possibility opened to us, in the agebetween the change of teeth and sexual maturity, to approachthe child through education. 8 The freed-up etheric body no longer gathers archetypical images that work through the physical body directly from the spiritual world, but takes them, self-prepared from daily experiences, along on the nightlyjourney. The Waldorf curriculum replaces the effects of form-creatingspiritual beings. So, that is how the high value placed upon the significanceof sleep should be understood as Rudolf Steiner indicated at the beginningof The Study of Man . 9 Instruction That Is Education for Proper Sleep In three different instances Rudolf Steiner described how we could teach the curriculum so that it could further work in sleep in the positiveway. 10 If we lead the children into a creative activity such as form drawing, it is necessary to evoke an outlook of an inner nature. For instance, inneractivity should receive an impulse that creates a sense for symmetry. Thechild should be able to form the logical completion from out of him- or163.herself. The active urge to finish incomplete forms stimulates the body of formative energy to pulsate further during sleep. The child has, throughthis, the tendency to finish what was begun so that through the night apermanent ability can be attained from the practiced activity. If the physical body and the etheric body are engaged by outer activity, perhaps through eurythmy, then the two higher bodies, the astraland the \"I,\" have the tendency to resist this activity because it does not, atfirst, suit their own impulse. Nevertheless, the movements are impressedupon these higher bodies, and they carry the memory of them in the spiritualworld at night. There, the activities of the day can be attuned and put intoaccordance with the spiritual experiences. Only through this workingtogether can the eurythmy work of the previous day unfold its health-givingforce. In the first case, it has to do with leading the formative activity of the children into the sphere of creative thought of the spiritual hierarchies. 11 The second example points us to another way: Outer activity of the physicalbody and the etheric body, (and this applies not only to eurythmy), mustbe in accord with the laws of cosmic forms of movement and rhythms.That is how the energy that is changed during the night can also radiatetoward the activity of the following day. The Sleep Between Observation and Understanding If we do not stimulate the children to their own physical activity during a lesson, then there is a third aspect to consider. We must stimulate the deliberate, understanding perception of the children when we teachfrom a phenomenological science experiment or describe a historical eventin such a manner that they direct their full attention to the lesson content sothat they are constantly coming to conclusions. In other words, the childrendo not just take in a stream of words or behaviors, but rather they recognizepatterns and forms and organize sequences of action and units of speechtogether into something that makes sense. It is best when the events164.presented are inserted into a space and time order because this appeals to the whole being. The students must, thereby, through their will, whollyconnect themselves to the forces and laws of the objective, physical world.The next step is to characterize the bare facts that have been presented.Once again in review, we look at the content, and underline what is essential,so that we can evaluate and judge the order of importance of differentparticulars as they apply to the whole context. With this, we further stimulatethe feelings of the children before they are dismissed from the lesson. Theconclusions that were formed can now further work on the limbs duringsleep in that part of a person into which the astral body and the \"I\" withdraw. What is experienced by the waking day-consciousness is processed in the metabolic regions and altered through the mediation of the planetaryenergies of Mercury and Venus. Through this, a transformation now beginsto unfold. Namely, during the night the etheric body unfolds its activity inthe head. 12 It should be recognized that the electrical currents of the brain slow down and the steady rise and fall of the delta waves increases. Theastral body, with its faster and unsteady rhythm, has gradually withdrawnfrom this region. The events perceived during the day now appear as imagesin the conceptual activity of the head that the children find before them thenext morning. Mercury and Venus as Representative Images of Sleep These two planets so strongly deviate from the other wandering stars in their laws of motion that they really cannot be commensurately presented in the same spherical system with the Earth. They must beconsidered in connection with the words \"contrary to Earth,\" just as theancient astronomers in the time of Pythagoras described them. 13 Talking about these two planets, Rudolf Steiner spoke of a \"stumbling around withinthemselves.\"165.Mercury and Venus, as viewed from the Earth as the nearest planets to the Sun, never stand in opposition to the central star. They can, therefore, at no time be seen as full-shining heavenly lights at midnight, but ratheronly mornings and evenings at the thresholds of sleep. To our perceptionthey move in front of and behind the Sun. Venus, especially, gets up to one quarter the distance from the Sun close to the Earth. No other planet comes so close to the Earth. Then itgoes back into the cosmic deep behind the Sun. One recognizes again fromthis image the slow sinking and rising of body temperature during sleep.Between these two extreme positions of the lower and upper conjunctions,Venus can be seen either as the morning or evening star. Like Mercury andthe Moon, Venus maintains its brilliance by reflecting sunlight. Mercury structures the synodal (coming together or conjunction) orbit of Venus, lasting 1 35 years, into five sections. With a median synodal orbit time of 116 days, which is subject to strong fluctuations, Mercury goesaround the Sun (as viewed from the Earth) exactly five times during a Venus-synod. As opposed to Venus, Mercury is never seen because it remains inthe immediate vicinity of the Sun. With every lower conjunction, when itcomes nearest to the Earth from behind the Sun, Mercury describes a loopwith its retrograde course during a period of 19 to 24 days (22% to 28% orabout a quarter of the synodal orbit). Venus also remains retrograde (always as viewed from the Earth) for 42 days during its lower conjunction. In eight years Venus traverses itsentire orbit exactly five times before its particular phenomena are repeatedat about the same places in the zodiac. During these eight years Venusdescribes a looping path around the Earth in the shape of a five-pointedstar. Mercury divides each of these five loops into five sections. These fivesections are again structured: the synodal Moon orbit at 29.5 dayscorresponds almost exactly to one quarter of a Mercury synod. Thefollowing comparison chart can be made with the physiological phases ofsleep:166.Venus synod Nighttime sleeping period Immersion into the cosmic Sinking and renewed rising of depths during an upper body temperature conjunction and renewednearing to the earthLength: 584 days Length: seven to eight hours Ratio: 1:5 Mercury synod Gradual immersion into deep Travels around the sun sleep, renewed emergencewith a retrograde period with a phase of paradoxnear the earth that (REM) sleep and possiblymakes up about one quarter of short awakenings.the orbit time.

Mercury behaves like the astral body when it comes out of the spiritual world and nears the physical body and wants to enter into it so that perhaps there is a short awakening. This coming near is completed five times every night during REM sleep before the \"longingof the soul for the physical body becomes so great that it sinks into it.\" 14 Even though the synodal orbit times of Venus and Mercury are differentfrom all other rhythmic orders, there is something that they have in common. By reason of their nearness to the Sun, both of them execute their path through the zodiac (viewed from the Earth) in about the same time as ourcentral star\u2014that is, a year. So, they draw their own rhythm from the steady course of the Sun in cosmic space. Observations made by modern sleep researchers can anticipate in detail the laws of movement of Venus and Mercury. These two planets bring growth forces close to the human soul when the physical body and theetheric body are in plant-like states. 15 The physiological processes in persons who are sleeping are divided into two large groups. Many sequences point to configurations of time that generally apply and that stand in established relationships among themselves. Especially in the deep-sleeping phase, the frequencies of brainelectrical current along with the delta waves come close to the beat of the pulse. In the biological time-organism of human beings, pulse and breathing act as equalizing centers between long-wave rhythms in the domain of the metabolism and high frequencies in the domain of the nerve-sense system. 16 During REM sleep the brain's electrical activity accelerates and the heart rate and breathing become irregular. The rhythms dissolve out of the cosmic order and exhibit no more ordered time configuration until the person again moves into a state of quiet sleep. However, these states of sleep in which both higher bodies are blended into the order of cosmic rhythms are significant for the transformation of daily experiences.168.The Astral Body Between Waking Consciousness and Dreaming After they have been processed by the human \"I\" and the astral body in the metabolic-limb system, carried out into the spheres of planetary transformation forces and mirrored into the active etheric body, the imagesof waking perception now appear as unconscious pictures. On thatfoundation, lessons the next day include a review of the previouslypresented events with the goal of forming a concept. Now, in preparing forwhat comes next, that part of the events that are licit and compliant to lawsmust be raised into consciousness so that the pictures that came about duringsleep take on meaning. 17 Namely, when the picture is not made conscious the etheric body has the tendency to penetrate the physical body. Itsuncontrolled effect would work clear into the nerves and blood processes. If the astral body does not succeed in carrying over the perceptions of the day into deep sleep, the transformation through the planetary forcesdoes not come about and consequences can be felt. It can be assumed thatdream pictures of the subsequent REM phase are then overshadowed bythe impression of the day's events and remain limited. Dreams require apreceding immersion into slow- wave sleep as is proven by complete sleepdeprivation: In the closing period, at first the portion of deep sleep isincreased, and only in the second night is the portion of REM sleep increased. However, if our dream pictures merely mirror echoes our daily experiences then sleep is missing its enlivening effect. We feel refreshedfollowing dreams which rise above the laws of time and space and whosecontents come from totally different spheres than that of our daily lives. 18 Concepts from the Realm of Imagination Still, refreshing, healing sleep is not the primary goal of the school lessons. It is the symptom of a successful link-up with the spiritual world.Sleep should sandwich itself between perceptions filled with feeling andthe formation of concepts.169.As human beings we are organized into the world so that we experience observed things and their associated meanings as separate. The activity of our senses, that can only pass on disassociated pieces to us, issupplemented by this conceptual thinking so that we gain knowledge ofobjective world-connectivity. 19 This process should now be interrupted for the students and continued by the immersion into sleep. What is changed through this for the formation of concepts? In observing a physical experiment or in merely registering historic events, the students form individual perceptions. They draw conclusions from what their eyes and ears offer them, and recognize and organize themaccording to their personal, previous experiences. The conclusion, however,is an act of will like that which we otherwise principally carry out with thelimbs. This act of will is seamlessly inserted into the lawful processes ofthe physical world. The goal of the processes of knowledge is the concept, which belongs to observed and registered content. However, this arises for our thinkinginto the head only insofar as at night the etheric body can unfold its activity.Between individualized perception and the understanding of supra-personal world events, the student completes his or her steps to knowledge.In the best case, feelings of having evidence for and a deep certainty ofexperiencing truth arise. This perception can spread in the soul as becomingreacquainted with something old and trusted, warm and light-filled. Whoever can find the connection with the universally valid world organization and experience it personally lifts him- or herself above themere acting-out of his or her own sympathies and antipathies. \"A trueindividuality will be that one who reaches the furthest with his or herfeelings in the realm of the imagination.\" 20 This connection happens at night for the student insofar as his or her daily, waking observations can meetthe individual's own genius. 21 What is being taught here through the world of hierarchical beings is the way from limbs to head, from conclusions to understanding.170.---------------------------- Footnotes: 1 Steiner, Rudolf.

In humanbiography, we find this rhythmic cycle in the lunar nodes rhythm or moon nodes. According to Steiner, important things are happening with the human soul at these points in time. The nights that a person lives through at these points in time are the most important nights of a person's life. There it is, where the macro cosmoscompletes its 18 breaths, completes one minute. And it is there where thehuman being, in a way, opens a window to a wholly different world. What are these lunar nodes whose influence upon human lives is noticed again and again over a vast cycle of time?174. The Astronomic Lunar Nodes First, let us ask the astronomers and allow them to explain to us the movement of the heavenly bodies. We will assume the vantage point of earth. Seen geocentrically, the sun orbits the earth. We call the orbital paththat it delineates thereby the ecliptic. The moon also orbits the earth. Vis-\u00e0-vis the sun's path, the ecliptic, the moon's orbital path is inclined about 5. Figure 1: The arrows show the direction of the moon's orbit. The earth is to be thought of as in the center of the orbital paths. The points at which the orbital paths of the sun and the moon intersect are called lunar nodes. Because the moon completes an orbit around the earth in one month, in this period it intersects the sun's orbitalpath twice, one time in a northerly direction called the north or ascendinglunar node, and a half-month later in a southerly direction called the southor descending node. Within these monthly repetitions, the intersection pointmoves retrogressively through the ecliptic. After 18.6 years this intersectionpoint has traversed the entire ecliptic (360) and stands in practically thesame place as it was 18.6 years earlier. In reference to human biography, itmeans that after 18 years, 7 months and 9 days, the ascending lunar node isagain standing at the same place as it was at the time of a person's birth.EarthEllipticMoon Junction176.Everyone can paint for themselves the picture of the dramatic consequences of our insisting on staying in the womb. So we decide to give up the protection and safety of the mother's organism. During the difficult and painful physical birthing process, wepass through a door to the other side and our independent life begins. Atfirst we take elementary steps: the first breath, intake of nutrition, anddigestion. Also for the first time, the organism must adjust to changingtemperatures. Suddenly, we are exposed to previously unknown and, atfirst, apparently threatening experiences. The signature that we recognize in the lunar nodes at birth we will find again in all the later lunar nodes during our lifetime. For one, it is thedecision to say goodbye to conditions that no longer offer us possibilitiesfor our inner and outer maturing process. Often, this decision will firstchannel itself in unconscious levels of our being and will at first only expressitself in that we feel uncomfortable, lonely, misunderstood, and constrictedby conventions and rules. We feel insignificant and unimportant. We getinto controversies with parents, friends, colleagues, and neighbors. Ayearning grows within us to do everything differently and begin somethingtotally new. Then, more or less consciously, old securities are given up inorder to accommodate our inner growth. Just like physical birth, these birthing processes also do not happen without labor, pain, and discomfiture. Injuries during these births cannotbe ruled out. The birthing process can go quickly or slowly. It can be lightor accompanied by dramatic events. Dr. Frank Nager, a cardiologist inZ\u00fcrich, says in his book, Goethe Dichter (The Dramatic Birth of Goethe ), \"Who came into this world half-choked, dark-cyanotic, and appearing to be dead. After this very first, early brush with death, the firstand fourth lunar nodes also brought the poet to the brink of death.\"177.The First Lunar Node We reach the first lunar node at 18 years, 7 months and 9 days after birth. This has to do with breaking away from one's family. It is necessary to unwind oneself from the stream of inheritance, from parental authority.It is the beginning of a new independence. Now it is also time to remove ourselves from people with whom we no longer share a common future in the sense of our birth impulse, peoplewho can no longer contribute anything to our further development andvice-versa. School and other friendships of our youth come to an end. Theconnection to parents loosens and must transform from a parent-childrelationship to a more equal, hopefully friend-based relationship. We aremoved by such questions as: What is the meaning of my life? Under whatlife impulses did I come onto the scene? Where on earth do I find the placewhere I can realize those impulses? We question ourselves about the right education, the right career. Even when we have already had to start a career for individual or familyreasons, served an apprenticeship, say, or are already tied to a job, eventhen, we often ask ourselves: Am I on the right career path? Is this mycalling? If these questions are not asked or, in the case of a negative answer, no way to change is found, there can be grave consequences in the future.The yearning for self-realization arises. At the time of the first lunar node,we begin to form our own personality; we begin working on ourselves.Just as a crawling baby one day stands upright, and, following the exampleof adults, wants to stand on her own two legs, so we also, at the age of 18 or19, want to inwardly stand upright, develop our own ideals and values,and act upon them. In this context, it is interesting that of the physical healings reported in the Gospels, an age is given only three times and two of them shed lighton lunar node events.In the Gospel of Luke , a story is told of a woman who178.has suffered an illness for 18 years. \"She was bent over and could not stand upright.\" Through Jesus' intervention, through word and deed, shecould \"on the spot stand upright again.\" This picture is amazingly exact. At this age, we still need outside help, a call from the outside, in order to seize uprightness. As a crawlingbaby, we had the example and encouragement of those people who stoodupright before us. It was parents and siblings who helpfully held out theirhands to the striving child. At 18 or 19, it is often the call of a spiritualforce, of destiny, that points the way to uprightness. Goethe's biography shows how dramatic and forceful this directional calling can be. In June 1768, the 18-year-old law student atLeipzig suffered a life-threatening hemorrhage. The deeper meaning ofthis threat was explained by the poet himself. Through disharmony he hadso stressed his organism \"that the systems contained within it finally hadto break out in a conspiracy and revolution in order to save the whole\"(found in Dichtung und Wahrheit ). An indication by Rudolf Steiner makes clearer what the aim was. \"That which lived within Goethe as hisindividuality was much larger than that which his organism could reallytake in\" (Lecture, November 11, 1906). Through the illness, Goetheexperienced a loosening between his etheric body and his physical bodywhereby he gained the ability to permeate himself with extrasensoryimaginations. It was an original kind of initiation, and it had the effect thathis physicality was not broken down at an early under the immensity andforce of the Goethe individuality. A concise description of the characteristic and task of the first lunar node is: From home into the world, Search for our own physical home.179.By that, it is not only the geographic location that is meant, but also our field of activity and where we can make ourselves at home. In Goethe'scase it was his earthly body itself with which he had to struggle to achieveas his home. The Second Lunar Node At the time of the second lunar node at 37 years, 2 months and 20 days, the third birthing process takes place. Now it has to do with unwinding oneself from larger social connections that hinder or cripplethe pre-birth impulse. The workplace, the circle of friends and colleagues,the larger circle of relatives and neighbors are all newly experienced andevaluated. The social environment as it has existed up until now is put tothe test. Also what has existed within the soul is questioned and newlyevaluated. Now the questions arise: Have I found my place socially? Within which human connections do I feel comfortable? Do I feel understood?Which people in my environment can I also count on in crisis situations?Who values me in my particular character? Where am I welcome with myspecial abilities? Where can I bring those abilities and be active? If the answers are not positive in the context of social associations, then new social connections are sought. At this age, Goethe found hisministry and social life in Weimar so constricting and suffocating that hefled to Italy. Enlivened and rejuvenated by the impressions and experiencesof his Italian travels, he could write to Mrs. Von Stein on January 6, 1787:\"Every day I peel off a new husk and hope to return as a human being.\"This soul-spiritual rebirth endowed him with a comprehensive outlook onnature. While in Italy, he formulated his ideas on metamorphosis of plantsand animals and plant and animal archetypes. The special light and colorexperiences of this southern landscape led to his theory of color.180.Oftentimes, there are surprising changes in careers at this time. The late 1970s dropout/alternative lifestyle movement was often attributed to the second lunar node. Successful industrial and bank managers, often 37to 40, voluntarily end their careers and turned to alternatives. Their newjobs frequently have underlying social motives that afforded little outsiderecognition but are more satisfying to the inner person. They drop out tofollow their hearts. During this time, destiny now also demands consciousrenunciation and sacrifice. Events of destiny, which happen to us at thistime, should be seen as strong appeals to our independence and initiativeand demand the unfolding of our heart forces. As a 19-year-old we have perhaps left school with a sense of relief and lightheartedly left our parent's home. It was, in a certain way, the naturalflow of life. But the separations and tasks that now come toward us becometests of the heart and demand courage and self-confidence. In the Gospel of St. John , we find the story of the lame man at Bethesda. He has been crippled for 38 years and has no one who will carry him to thewater. Jesus asks him, \"Will you get well?\" And the invitation he extendsto the sick man is irritating: \"So, take up your bed and walk.\" That is exactlywhat the cripple cannot do. But the cripple has understood what Christmeant. It is the power of inner adaptability, his soul-force, that overcomesoutside adversity as it is presented to us here with the picture of a lamebody. We can no longer allow ourselves to be carried by our fellow humanbeings. We must ourselves become those who carry others. We canunderstand the second lunar node as the following: Search for our own place of soul; our soul home. By developing our soul-forces, our heart-forces, we can also make ourselvesspiritually at home in our own social environment.181.The Third Lunar Node The third lunar node, occurring at 55 years, 10 months and 28 days, almost 56, brings further social leave-takings and new orientations. Retirement approaches: In Japan and France the retirement age for manyjobs is now 55. Career crises seem to accumulate. In Germany workers inthis age group are urged to take retirement. But even where that is not thecase, where no outside stress of this sort is present, we often come to aninner distress. Work that we have carried out with devotion andengagement for many years suddenly seems stale and empty. The activitydoes not satisfy us anymore. We can no longer be enthusiastic about ourjobs or work. In some longtime marriages and partnerships, emptiness, boredom, and indifference have encroached. All at once, these things, long covered-over by daily activities and routines, suddenly come to the fore of ourconsciousness and can lead to crisis in the marriage and possibly divorce.Or, anxiety awakens as we feel our waning physical strength that preventsus from fulfilling duties. We take stock of ourselves: Was that all? What of my life's desires and goals have I realized? What tasks and possibilities do I still have left?The wish and desire to leave something lasting and significant to the worldlive in us. Since our physical energy becomes less, we must, more thanever, examine what is important to us, what is essential, and ask: What doI still want to do? What do I still want to attain in my life? At the second lunar node the question was: In what human social connections do I feel comfortable? Now a spiritual element arises: Do westill have common interests and goals? Do we still have anything to say toone another? Or are we just staying together out of habit? Friendships andsocial relationships are examined and weighed according to their spiritualconnectivity and lasting value. Encountering serious illness and death alsobecomes more frequent. How many people at this time become ill with182.cancer, have a heart attack, or suffer the threatening climax of a chronic illness? The thought of dying and death comes more strongly intoconsciousness and serves to sharpen our gaze into the spiritual world.We become contemplative. What comes after death? Where do we comefrom? Where are we going? What deeper meaning does life have? Spiritual and religious questions become important. If we have, up to now, felt only nominally connected to a religious community, we nowsense the need to deepen our religious experience. We truly want to know.We want to experience the reality and truth of the spiritual world. The titleover this period of our lives could read: How do we see ourselves being seen in the world? We experience ourselves as spiritual-creative beings and want to know:Where is my distinctive place in a spiritually everlasting house? It Is the Spiritual Home that is Sought Goethe reached his third lunar node in 1805. He became ill in the first months of this year and was plagued by kidney colic. His friend Schiller also became ill during these months. On May 1st, Goethe visited him forthe last time, and on May 9th Schiller died. Three weeks later Goethe wroteto Zelter about the loss of his good friend: \"I thought I would lose myself,but instead I have lost a friend and at the same time half of my being.\" ButGoethe did not remain in this resigned state. Some time later, while lookingat Schiller's skull, he said: What more can a person have from life Than God-Nature revealing itselfHow it allows the solid to trickle away to spiritHow it solidly preserves that created by spirit.183.The Fourth and Fifth Lunar Nodes The fourth lunar node occurs at 74 years and 5 months. The fifth lunar node is at 92 years, 1 month and 9 days and nowadays is more and more often experienced. Up to this time, whoever has attained to a certain wisdom and has resolved the tasks of the previous lunar nodes, in accordance with his orher individual possibilities, for that person the heavenly realm becomespermeable and he or she can let some of their wisdom radiate into his/hersurroundings. The lunar node energy that now streams toward us is nolonger important for one's own becoming. It is a gift that, with our aid, canbe further bestowed upon all of humankind. In the domain of the fourthlunar node, we can create warmth of soul and a soul-home for those peoplesurrounding us. If we have gained enough spiritual strength and qualities,then in the domain of the fifth lunar node, our physical body itself canbecome a place of the spirit. The signature of the fourth lunar node is singular in Goethe's destiny. His heart-forces underwent a two-fold test, physical and spiritual. InFebruary/March of 1823, Goethe had a heart attack, which again led himto the gates of death. He had just recovered when the 74-year-old becameinflamed with passion for the 18-year-old Ulrike von Levetzow. But hisoffer of marriage, presented through the Grand Duke Carl-August vonWeimar, was delicately and discretely refused. The poet must abjurepersonal happiness. In three poems that Goethe later combined under thetitle \"Trilogie der Leidenschaft\" (Trilogy of Passion), we can see how Goethemended his broken heart by gaining deeper insight into his experiences. Past - Present - Future The lunar nodes occur at exact intervals, to the day. However, the node-related events can happen over weeks and months, as everyone knows184.from experience. When we look closely at these occurrences, we discover in them a clearly integrated dynamic of time, best represented by a swirl. Figure 2 The past becomes effective, something comes to an end, a kind of vacuum comes about. Within this vacuum, the future shines forth. Butthis future is still unformed and it takes our own, courageous decisions tograsp it and make it our own. We can understand the astrological or astronomical exact lunar nodes as the turning points where our past that has been worked throughcan become our future\u2014or where everything can come to a standstill. Onlywhen the turnabout succeeds can we proceed in harmony with our birthimpulses. The Descending Lunar Nodes Previously we have spoken only of the ascending lunar nodes. There are also effects of the descending lunar nodes. They occur halfway between two ascending nodes, i.e., in the 9th year, 27th year, and so forth. The signature of the half-node is a initial, tender suggestion to find what the compelling task of the next ascending node will be. On the otherhand, at this time another chance presents itself to resolve whatever wasnot accomplished during the previous node. Events having to do with the185.descending lunar nodes are seldom outwardly apparent. They are times of quiet separations and changes and take place in the deeper layers of ourbeing. Our Hidden Plan If one asks individuals about their life goals, most of the answers name external goals: I want to be a carpenter, a college professor, computer expert, an artist, a successful manager, an entrepreneur, build a house, be aloving husband or wife and have children, have a lot of friends, have aconvivial home, earn a lot of money, and so forth. Whoever has attained certain goals has also experienced that happiness and satisfaction are usually of short duration. What penetratesthe consciousness, at the latest by the third lunar node, is what we carrywith us as a hidden plan from the moment of our birth. It is the desire tocreate something that will outlast us and, in the best sense of the word, toachieve self-realization. We are not the professor, the opera singer, the homeowner, the happy family member. Those are only props on the stage of our life. We are adistinctive \"I,\" and we want to be recognized and acknowledged as such.We want to carry something into the world that only we can bring. The Lunar Nodes: Processes of Purification and Change In our times, the danger is that we totally go submit to superficialities and thereby lose ourselves. The lunar nodes repeatedly bring us anew our pre-birth resolutions, our hidden plans, and punctuate them into ourmemories again so that we can come through all the aberrations and findour way back to our paths of destiny and our original tasks. The questions \"Who am I?\" and \"What do I want?\" come into our consciousness in ever-new forms at these times. And the lunar node eventsstart processes of purification and change at ever-new levels:186. The first lunar node in the realm of the personal, The second lunar node in the realm of family, friends, and career, and The third lunar node in the realm of the supra-personal human. Social connections and relationships, which serve only to tie us to the past though they are dear to us but out of which nothing new can come, must be left behind. With such connections, development comes to a standstill. It does not go any further. A vacuum comes about. We are called upon from the outside to make destiny-changing decisions. Lunar node forces stream into these breathing spaces of fate, call forth renewing energyfrom our inner self, awaken the will to sculpt something new of our own. At first, this something new announces itself through inner alienation, upheavals, and partings. We feel misunderstood, have self- doubt, experience our own inanity, feel insensible, helpless, deeply lonely, and abandoned. But then thoughts are born out of this inner distress and courageous decisions are made that ignite us with new life and new energy. We enterinto a pioneer-mode and an atmosphere of departure that, at the same time, awakens our willingness and courage to sacrifice and our ability to assert ourselves. Whether the lunar node process brings about dramatic change or occurs practically unnoticed varies from person to person and can bedifferent from node to node. For a person who lives strongly in the past and holds tight to what is known, rejecting the new, it can become a long, painful struggle wherein perhaps only a grave stroke of fate, a threat toexistence, or a confrontation with illness and death is what leads the person to change. If a person can lead a life that is in harmony with her or his birth-impulses, the lunar nodes can pass almost unnoticed. But they will always experience once again a reinvigoration and intensification of those impulses.187.Lunar node events and experiences are as varied and individual as people themselves. But what they all have in common is that at this time a window to the spiritual world is opened through which we can look at our hidden plan. Then, strengthened by spiritual energy, we can make progress in our striving to unfold our deepest life impulses.188.189.The Adolescent Years by L. Francis Edmunds Waldorf Journal Project #2 from Education as an Art , Vol. 35, No. 2 The transition from childhood to youth brings many problems. The critical faculty is awake but not yet maturity of judgment. The impact of life becomes deeply personal but the direction in life is in no way clear. Themost familiar relationships fall subject to question. The young person needsguidance but jibes at authority. He guards jealously the little flame ofindependence of which he now becomes aware. There is a longing for self-expression and little ability to express\u2014this gives rise to all manner ofcrudities. There is quick resentment over little things. Moods swing easilyfrom elation to depression. The will to love and be loved brings confusingemotions and desires, if not actual eroticism, nursed to profusion by our\"sexy\" age. Ideals and aspirations wrestle with worldly ambitions, \"castlesin the air\" are rife. Even the intelligent youngster is not secure from suddenfollies. To understand is not to conform. Temptations come strong. Vanitiesplay their part. In a chaotic environment where the adults themselves livein fear, anxiety and contradiction, what can these young folk do? Thepronounced delinquent of the headlines covers incipient ills that are farmore widespread than is generally admitted. There is much corruption190.everywhere. Moral appeals may bolster up \"the good\" but they have little effect on \"the wicked.\" Where is the method? Things that were onceconsidered \"bad\" are now considered \"not so bad.\" Alternatively, placardmorality is busily in search of scapegoats. Meanwhile the adolescent, nolonger just a child to authority and not yet an adult responsible to himself,does as best he can; for the most part he seeks refuge in his own kind. Butthe sensitive and susceptible suffer acutely. A disturbed life of youth mayeasily wreck a whole lifetime. Theories do not help. For the youngster mostof all, proof of the pudding lies in the eating. Two questions occur: How can we best prepare for adolescence?How can we best educate the adolescent? Waldorf education claims that childhood makes one whole. As surely as a plant has root and leaf and blossom and yet is indivisible in its unity,so surely does childhood comprise its three main phases, pre-dentition,elementary years to puberty, and adolescence, each succeeding the other inthe one great process of becoming man. The ideal of such a school can onlybe to guide the child through all the years from kindergarten to collegeentrance. Exceptions there will have to be\u2014children have joined our schoolsas late as the eleventh grade with happy results\u2014yet the ideal remains. Inthis total range of childhood there is a natural progression from limb toheart to head. That which the little child can learn to do, that which theelementary child can learn to feel, the adolescent can learn to understand.Almost ninety years of work, spread today through some 900 schools inmany lands, have brought much evidence in their wake. The little child lives primarily by imitating all that is around him. His open consciousness, little aware of \"self,\" allows the world to streaminto him just as it is; in this sense nothing escapes him. For him the world is191.action: thoughts and feeling also act upon him. This immense receptivity and power to cope bespeak a devotion to life and a trust in man comparableonly to a religious attitude of selflessness at its highest level. The power ofthe spirit in these years is strong. The little child grasps the world withfearless hands, transmitting all things to the depths of its own inner being;that which is thus received in infancy is uttered forth in latest maturity. Thechild that has learned to pray in his earliest years will know how to bless inhis old age, says Rudolf Steiner. The little child carries within him anunconscious faith that the world is grounded in goodness. The adult whoadmits the truth of this in heart and soul, striving to think, to feel, to actaccordingly, striving also to create a harmony of life in the environment,removing all nervous influences such as radio, television and the rest, willbe best able to help, guide and encourage these early growing years. The child in the elementary school years lives first and foremost by his feelings. What we remember best in later years are the things we feltmost, whether in people, in circumstances or events. In these years,education is of the heart, not by precepts but by an appeal to the imagination.The ideas of good and bad mean nothing to a child of seven; but a storywith contrasting characters, the one \"good,\" the other \"bad,\" though thewords be never mentioned (it is best to leave the story to speak for itself)will go straight to the child's heart. There are colors that live harmoniouslytogether and others that clash; there are tones that merge in happy concordand others that are strident and discordant; there are actions that arebeautiful in themselves and others that are ugly. The child, wakening frominfancy, builds up an inner world of impressions penetrated with feeling;more and more as he grows older, this becomes his refuge and his home.Even as he approaches the more thoughtful years from twelve to fourteen,it is still a \"felt\" thinking, a thinking with the heart. For the adult this is thegift that makes him an artist or a poet; for the child in these years it isnatural. The ideal that lives below words in these years is that of beauty. In192.all that is 'beautiful' in thought, in word, in action, in nature itself, we behold more than the outer eye can yield; here the spirit shines into the world ofthe senses. It was a scientist who claimed that \"art enhances consciousness.\"The teacher must above all work as an artist-he describes all life with all itsmany faces, be it in literature and history, be it in the kingdoms of outernature; he brings the precious intangibles of the world to the child's powersof apprehension. The scribes and the Pharisees of our times will regard thisas fanciful; they are wrong today as they were of old. One who has witnessedhealth and strength and cheerfulness and confidence entering into a child'slooks and gestures as the years go by must know them wrong. The story ofman, rooted in depths, powers and dimensions of creative existence beyondhis knowing, is itself the revelation of a mighty and transcendent work ofart. Then comes the birth of independent thought, the love of the abstract and non-sensory, following as near as possible the phase of puberty. Heredisturbance makes itself felt at once. There is much on record to show thatpuberty may set in too soon and true adolescence correspondingly too late,making an uneasy gap where many harms arise. Then education needs tobe alert and therapeutic; but we are concerned now with the normal. Theadolescent looks outward with a new gaze and also inward. All that he hasquietly assimilated through his childhood years, all he has learned and feltand practiced, the capacities he has been able to develop, the difficulties hehas had to encounter\u2014these now meet him at the level of thought. He entersupon the phase of learning to know himself, of having to learn how to facehimself. At the same time, his environment lights up for him with a newinterest\u2014it pulls him to itself. He recognizes his world, the world he is toenter fully one day, the world of enterprise in which he must play his part.This birth to a life of independent thought does not come overnight, nordoes it come equally to all children. It is generally blurred in the ninth grade,comes to clarity in the tenth, and grows to relative strength in the eleventh193.and twelfth grades, but it invariably brings with it a force of personal enthusiasm for life. If it does not, then something is badly amiss already.The adolescent wants to believe in the world, he wants to love and approvehis age, he wants to have confidence in life, to enjoy and admire and evenidealize the achievements that confront him. He wants to be modern, toaccept what is there as his right, his heritage, and careless opposition onthe part of his elders will easily drive him to rebellion. The ideal he bringsis for truth. The first assumption of his nature is that the world is built ontruth. His spontaneous aspiration is to be a true man, to live in truth and toexpect truth in others. But now, by degrees, there come the contradictions. She reads the headlines and dives down beneath them, sees the inconsistencies in adultlife, is first astonished, then bewildered, and then unhappily dismayed. Inher first burst of confidence she may easily mistake good for evil, evil forgood. She is met with a presentation of life where spirit is denied and matterexalted. Is the human an animal after all? The learned say so; true, the humanis something more, but how much? She begins to question her childhoodfaith\u2014then she believed because others believed, but now she wants tojustify belief. She questions her dependence on her parents\u2014is she notherself and why should she not have her own way? She questions theauthority of her teachers\u2014are not they, too, only humans? As she entersher most sensitive years at seventeen and eighteen, she nurses many a doubtand sorrow in secret. She wants a hero she can trust and follow, one of herown choosing. Where can she find this hero? Is there truth? If so, what istruth? What is life really based on? Youth is naturally introspective. Is therea soul? Is there a God? What is she herself apart from heredity andenvironment\u2014is she anything at all? How can a human being's statementbe more than his opinion? Who knows? Not all will place their questions as radically as this or as consciously. Some will, but all carry them in mood and feeling; this is the bond of194.communion the young have with one another, fellows in adventure, and the loves that follow. This is where the problems begin for the adolescenthimself, for his parents, his teachers. What can life offer? At the same timelife does offer many attractions and rouses many desires and longings;healthy youth is virile and has wants and tastes and appetites. Even thesebring inner conflicts and moral doubts and scruples. One of the most honestlads I know confessed he thought himself a liar and he suffered from it.Another, realizing for himself that all desire was selfish, fled from love andthen asked whether desire for an ideal was not also selfish. At eighteen,beginning for some with the thought of national service and all itsimplications, life suddenly seems conditioned against one's will. The reverseis to abandon oneself to mere living, taking all things as they come. Arethere not theories today to excuse almost any line of conduct? Chastity, it istaught, belongs to the Middle Ages. Gratification relieves repression. Howare the young to know? Some turn religious; many go the other way. Weadults must admit that life is a welter\u2014we do our best, but our own premisesare often none too strong. Life is sadly inconsistent, yet we want strongmen and gracious women and a generation that loves the truth. All this puts the greatest possible burden of responsibility on education itself. If the adolescent has been rightly protected in hiskindergarten years, if he has been rightly guided through his elementaryschool years, if in these earlier years he has felt the force of goodness andthe strength of beauty, he will also find his way to truth. Then the securityof the heart will come to meet the doubts of the head and the turbulence ofthe will. He has been taught through art and can be further taught to developa sense of fitness in life itself. He has been taught in such a way that he canclearly discriminate between fact and theory, that fact will always hold thetruth in itself but theories have changed and will change again. He sees asa matter of course that life is a conflict and always has been and that it mustbe so. There are thoughts that add to the content of life, that make it nobler,195.and others that take away, reducing man to an ignoble thing. There are dragons to fight in this age as in all ages, and the call for knighthood is asstrong as ever. The animal lives by desire; humans can acquire motives to combat desire. The plant lives by necessity; humans can call to their aid powers ofself-determination. The crystal is bound to its form; humans can strive forinner form and can also transform. Creation is bound in law, and humansare also bound\u2014but we can unbind. Defeat is not the end but only the spurto further effort, and there have been victories and human beings havenever yet been finally defeated. In the end all rests on the initiative ofmankind, whether we can draw up from the depths of our own being thepowers we need to humanize existence. Goodness, beauty, truth\u2014theseare his attributes, his childhood faiths before he is a man; these he canapprehend in consciousness and translate into life and so declare himselfand find his way to freedom. The greatest have known that freedom can beborn only from within even as manhood itself must be born from within\u2014nothing can make for true manhood other than man himself. But thengoodness, beauty, truth, expressed in religion, art and the search forknowledge, themselves give evidence of man's real being\u2014he hasengendered them and through them he is related to his source. If educationcan lead to this synthesis of confident striving within the soul of the humanbeing, it has surely led to something. In a Waldorf school, instruction is a means for education, and education has to do with a right growing into life. There is no indoctrination,only the aid a child needs at the different levels of his growing to discoverhis own inherent powers, so that in adult life he or she may truly find him/ herself. For the adolescent the teacher should be a witness for truth. His knowledge needs to be rooted in the realities of human nature, realitiesthat far transcend the light of common day. The knowledge that Steiner hasgiven, of man as a being of body, soul and spirit, that knowledge the teacher196.can make his own, and with that he can work. It is a knowledge that brings illumination to human life and shows the way to inner freedom, aknowledge that enables the teacher to address himself in confident moodto the highest potentialities in the child, making of himself the gardener ofthe most precious plant of all. The perilous years of adolescence requiresuch a knowledge in the teacher; then the stability engendered in the firstyears of childhood, the training in social relationships and heart-fitness ofthe middle years with the class teacher, flower into a right independence ofoutlook, right discrimination and judgment, right confidence and rightinitiative in the adolescent. But that this may come about at its best, weneed to guide the child progressively through all his years of schooling. In the ninth grade the child begins to waken to himself, in the tenth grade he begins to waken to the earth as a whole, in the eleventh grade hebegins to question into the meaning of life, in the twelfth grade he maycome to the assurance that the ultimate answer rests in man himself. Hehas learned to understand the descent of the human being to earth, he haslearnt to love the kingdoms that surround him, and now he can foresee themeans for man's re-ascent. He has learned to appreciate the scholarship ofhis day and to view it as a transition process to an age of new discoverieswhen religion, art and science which appear to have fallen apart will oneday be reunited to give new insights to the meaning of life on earth. He haslearned to see that the contradictions which surround him are of humanmaking and may be resolved again, that in this lies the task of evolutionand that life is a call to action. He has learned to value each person for him-or herself. This his childhood will have given him to take into adult life.The details he will by then have forgotten but the attitude and the endeavor he will remember. He/she will have been prepared to enter life. "}
