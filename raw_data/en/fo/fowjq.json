Read, DVM, MVSc, DACVS In March, I took my oldest daughter\u2014an aspiring commercial pilot\u2014to the 2022 International Women in Aviation Conference, where it was fascinating to watch how another industry recruits the best and brightest to come join them. Women make up just 9% of the aviation industry, so the organizers were working hard to encourage more students to follow in their footsteps and join their ranks. In her keynote address, General Jacqueline Van Ovost, a four-star general who leads the military's global transpor - tation network USTRANSCOM, spoke about honoring those who came before us and living up to the expecta-tions they lay for us, working with and encouraging our colleagues with whom we stand shoulder to shoulder every day, and mentoring and paving the way for those who are coming up behind us. She spoke of our collective responsi-bility in a profession to plow the ground, straighten the path and create openings where there might not have been before. Long after our return from that conference, this talk stuck with me as I reflected on our profession. Our equine veterinary profession is in crisis. We all know it. Many of you are struggling to find someone to hire for your practice. Those of you teaching in academic institu-tions like I do have watched the dwindling supply of students entering the field. The sad reality is that at the start of vet school, about 37% of students claim to want to enter equine practice; by final year, the number drops to about 5%; and at graduation, only 1.5% are hired into positions. Perhaps worst of all, within the first five years, 50% of these new colleagues will leave equine practice, many entering small animal practice instead. Much has been learned from the work of the task force established in 2021 by the AAEP board of directors and chaired by Drs. Carol Clark and Rob Trimble. They inter - viewed 60 practice owners, new associates and students about the challenges facing equine practice and shared the results at last year's annual convention. In January, the board decided to act in three key areas to address these challenges: 1) convene a practitioners' summit, 2) focus on the issues with internships, and 3) establish a plan for enhanced mentorship programming. Over several days in mid-May, I spent time with 19 colleagues from across the U.S. at a practitioners' summit organized by board member Dr. Jim Zeliff. He invited a representative from every VMG and from each Decade One group in the country, plus a few other ad hoc members to make sure we had all the diversity of the profession represented. During two days of intense discus-sions geared towards finding a solution to our dire situation, hard conversations and brutal honesty took us to a place of prioritizing four things that all attendees believe are needed to transform equine practice into a more satisfying place for all to work: 1. Compensation must increase. Our veterinary graduates are entering practice with large debt loads\u2014in some cases, $200,000-300,000 plus. Their starting salaries are much lower than in the companion animal field while their workweeks are one to two days longer on average. They perform after-hours emergency call that most companion animal veterinarians pass off to established colleagues set up only for that purpose. All meeting attendees agreed that a variety of mechanisms will need to be employed to make it happen, but salaries must be raised to attract and retain our young talent. 2. Emergency duty must be made manageable. All equine practitioners need a manageable work-life balance to avoid burnout. A variety of on-call models were discussed and will be shared with members via AAEP's media channels. Innovative solutions must be found to protect and invest in the health and welfare of all our members. 3. Scheduling must be flexible and allow for some autonomy. All equine practitioners need to be able to prioritize family. Many of our predecessors lost marriages and relationships with other loved ones as a result of their dedication to the profession. Having meaningful relationships requires an investment of time and energy, so we need to avoid people being so tired after their workweek that they have nothing left to give; or having a workweek that never ends so they never recover. We need to prioritize working together and having time off that is truly time off. 4. Mentorship needs to be provided in a variety of forms. The older generations think of mentorship as having a wise older member informing a younger member, whereas many younger members want someone at the same stage of career to help support them through the tough times. The reality is that our young members can benefit from both types of support, and some older members want nothing short of the same thing too. As General Van Ovost pointed out, we need to stand shoulder to shoulder with our colleagues and help each other along, and we need to straighten the path for those who are coming after us. It wouldn't hurt to support them monetarily either, so we will be working to build scholarship support to help them pay back the cost of their education. continued on next pageDr. Emma Read EVENewsINSERT_06-22.indd Ation Recognize a colleague for their volunteer service by nominating them for the AAEP' s Good Works for Horses campaign at aaep.org/good-works-horses.5 things to know about AAEP this month 2.

The AAEP has published on its website comprehensive guidelines to educate practitioners about risk factors, transmission, clinical signs, treatment and other considerations pertaining to Leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that can cause acute renal failure, in-utero infection and abortion, and equine recurrent uveitis in infected horses. There are currently more than 35 recognized Leptospira species comprising more than 300 distinct serovars of Leptospira, many of which are capable of infecting both animals and humans. In horses, Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona type kennewicki is responsi-ble for most cases of clinical disease in North America. \"Leptospirosis is a sporadic but important disease of equids with the potential for substantial impact on breeding farms and horses residing in endemic regions,\" said Dr. Sally DeNotta, clinical assistant professor of large animal internal medicine at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine and chair of the AAEP's Infectious Disease Committee. \"We hope these guidelines will support early recogni-tion of the clinical signs of equine Leptospirosis and facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment of affected animals.\" Antimicrobial therapy is often used to treat clinical signs and reduce Leptospira shedding in infected horses. For prevention of Leptospirosis infection and abortion in horses residing in endemic regions, an inactivated Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona type kennewicki vaccine is available and approved for use in healthy horses six months of age and older. Dr. DeNotta co-authored the Leptospirosis Guidelines with Dr. Thomas J. Divers, the Rudolph J. and Katharine L. Steffen Professor of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. The guidelines were reviewed and approved by the AAEP's Infectious Disease Committee and board of directors. View the guidelines or save them to your mobile device for future reference at aaep.org/document/ leptospirosis-guidelines. AAEP guidelines for other infectious diseases can be found at aaep.org/guidelines/infectious-disease-control/using-guidelines. AAEP publishes Leptospirosis Guidelines From the president, continued As we wrapped up the summit, we all coalesced around the idea that we needed to transform equine practice for ourselves, for our future colleagues and for the horse. Ensuring quality practitioners are there in years to come to care for our patients is priority one as we address this crisis. We agreed that we would start a campaign called \"Change the Numbers.\" We invite you to join in it with us. We want to increase recruitment, increase retention, and decrease those leaving our profession tired and burnt out. We want to decrease debt load and increase compensation, and make the hours spent working more effective and manageable. We want to increase the satisfaction rating of internship programs and increase the number of young colleagues having formal mentorship programs. Every single person in the equine profession has a role to play\u2014practice owners, associates, new graduates, interns, technical and support staff, students, horse owners as well as those in academia, industry and other ancillary roles. AAEP is on a path to transform equine practice to honor those who came before us and their legacy, to lift up our struggling colleagues so they can keep pace beside us, and to pave the way for those who are coming behind us so they don't have to trip and stumble like we did. We should be so lucky to have them be interested in doing what we are doing and want to join us. So please get involved and start to make a change in the numbers before the equine profession becomes just a sad old statistic.Anterior uveitis in an adult horse with Leptospirosis. Dr. Caryn Plummer, University of Florida EVENewsINSERT_06-22.indd To formalize the organization's commitment to expanding diversity and belonging within equine practice, the AAEP board of directors in January approved the formation of a standing committee to guide the association's long-term efforts. The Committee evolved from the initial work of the DEI Task Force, which was formed in fall 2020 by the AAEP board. Comprised of seven AAEP members and chaired by Dr. Jean-Yin Tan, the Task Force developed the AAEP's first-ever position statement on diversity within equine practice. The group also created strategic recommenda-tions to promote inclusivity, support and safety of AAEP members; expand representation of underrepresented members in volunteer and leadership roles; and develop educational programming about diversity, equity and inclusion for members and practice staff. \"We are grateful to Dr. Tan and colleagues for their service to our organization in starting our journey,\" said Dr. Emma Read, 2022 AAEP president. \"AAEP strives for everyone from all walks of life and lived experiences to find a place where they feel comfortable, can thrive and be their whole authentic selves every day in equine practice. Our profession will be its most successful in attracting and retaining people when everyone on the team can come to work and feel comfortable in their own skin. We are excited about the establishment of a formal committee dedicated to this important work and look forward to their progress.\" The newly formed DEI Committee will be chaired by Dr. Mitchell Rode, who served as the Task Force's liaison to the AAEP board. The Committee will focus on imple-menting the DEI strategic recommendations approved by the AAEP board.

During a discussion of processing the internal guilt when having to deny service based on a horse owner's inability to pay, Dr. First emphasized giving the client options instead of a hard 'no' when possible. \"Right now, there are a lot of fantastic options\u2014CareCredit has great terms for the client to spread payments out. We have a wellness plan that has monthly payments and if [wellness plan participants] have an emergency, they get half off of services on an emergency, so it gives them a little bit of insurance there too.\" Additional topics addressed are client pushback to payment at time of service, storing clients' credit card information safely and legally, how practices measure the effectiveness of their AR programs, how practices with a significant amount of billing manage their AR, how to handle when payment is declined by the credit card company, and advice for associates paid on production concerning internal communication within a practice when work they've performed is uncollected.

Anderson, DVM At its simplest, ethics is a system of moral principles. They affect how people make decisions and lead their lives. Perhaps no single word will impact equine practitioners' quality of life more than ethics. We do not make decisions in any aspect of our lives in a vacuum, and the core of who we are and how we choose to live our lives will be formed by the integrity and mindfulness placed in developing our moral principles. Ethics and professional conduct behaviors cross all stages of equine practice. Veterinary students are influenced by the knowledge and education demonstrated by the teaching colleges; young veterinarians are influenced by both the clientele and colleagues they work with as well as the mentorship they receive during their formative years; and experienced practitioners may be influenced by their decisions related to personal choice and retired veterinarians by their past decisions. In the U.S., qualified veterinarians are required to adhere to the American Veterinary Medical Association's Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics (avma.org/resources-tools/avma-policies/principles-veterinary- medical-ethics-avma). These principles ring true at first glance but, on more critical consideration, there are some inherent conflicts with practice reality. Diagnostic and treatment options are constantly evolving with new technology, inevitably at a higher cost. Too often, younger practitioners are unfamiliar with less expensive options as their training has taken place in a specialty environment with cases that have been referred for advanced care, thus spectrum of care is worthy of discussion. Both of these subjects are critical to shaping one's personal and professional ethical decisions. Mentorship is transformational early; later in one's practice career, lifetime learning and curiosity traits will sustain the quality and relevance of those ethical decisions to produce a life well lived. Just as there is rarely \"black and white\" and most often \"two sides to a story,\" there is a spectrum of care that can be difficult to grasp if there is limited exposure to either end. The Ohio State University has embarked on a deliberate education of this range via their Preparing for Excellence in Veterinary General Practice program that \"aims to address the growing problem of affordability of veterinary care by providing a continuum of acceptable care that considers available evidence-based medicine while remaining responsive to client expectations and financial limitations thereby successfully serving an eco-nomically diverse clientele.\" 1 Fig. 1\u2014Illustration of the spectrum of care concept. Spectrum of care involves providing a range of diagnostic and treatment options (top) and should not be viewed in a binary manner (bottom). 2 What about those cases that may respond to basic, lower-cost treatments that are low tech and utilize core veterinary skills but for which the owners are unable to access any financial resources due to tragic circumstances or poor planning? In 2020, The Foundation for the Horse and the AAEP partnered with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to manage a program offering relief to horse owners unable continued on next pageDr. Kathleen Anderson EtHics Dr. Anderson is a founding partner of Equine Veterinary Care in Elkton, Md.

For the next three years, two $50,000 projects will be awarded annually. These new grants are made possible by a generous gift from Mrs. Penelope Knight and her Coyote Rock Ranch to seed the program and further expand The Foundation's research footprint. Individuals with a background in equine research and a previous record of research publication are encouraged to submit proposals focused on areas of equine medicine that will improve the science needed to elevate the health and welfare of the horse. \"We are grateful to Mrs. Knight and the team at Coyote Rock Ranch for their continued support of The Foundation, and now into the area of innovation and discovery,\" said Dr. Anthony Blikslager, Foundation Research Working Group chair. \"Having the funds to move to this next level of support for established research-ers is part of our strategic plan, and this gift allows us to begin this important phase of research funding quicker.\" While all topics will be considered for funding, particular interests include musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, respira-tory and endocrine disease. Lameness, laminitis, colic and development of diagnostic technology are areas also considered to be important and in need of investigation.Although not a requirement for funding, selected investi-gators will be strongly encouraged to publish their results in a refereed journal and/or submit abstracts for presenta-tion at the AAEP Annual Convention. Grant proposals must be received by August 1, 2022. Additional information, including application instructions, requirements and selection criteria, is available at foundationforthehorse.org/innovation-discovery- research-grants. FoUnDAtion Ethics, continued to afford veterinary care. The Vet Direct Safety Net program (aaep.org/horse-owners/vet-direct-safety-net) provides up to $600 to AAEP members in the U.S. for common equine emergencies such as medical colic (treated on farm), lacerations, chokes, and euthanasia. Providing an affordable treatment option alleviates the mental and ethical anxiety often faced by both owner and veterinarian in equine emergencies and may partially pave the way to solve the challenges of emergency care for non-client patients. We all have a role to play in ethics and professional conduct to uphold the quality of the equine practice environment. Equally important, however, we owe it to ourselves and our families to understand ethical principles and apply those to our practice lives with the expectation of continued mental and fiscal health. \"What lies behind us and what lies before us are small matters compared to what lies within us.\" \u2014Oliver Wendell Holmes References: 1 JAVMA 2021 259 463 Figure 2 p 464 - Fingland - Preparing veterinary students for excellence in general practice building confidence and competence by focusing on spectrum of care 2 JAVMA 2021 259 463 Figure 2 p 465 - Fingland - Preparing veterinary students for excellence in general practice building confidence and competence by focusing on spectrum of careEtHics EVENewsINSERT_06-22.indd 7 5/31/22 11:20 AMVIII AAEP News June 2022 Convention keynote to help practitioners set healthy boundaries Leadership involves making the right decisions, and those decisions often bring conflict. Whether in the C-suite of major corporations or within the dynamics of an equine practice and the veterinarian-client-patient relation-ship, many leaders experience feelings of burnout, compassion fatigue, guilt, and anxiety about saying no when they need to. During his keynote presentation, \"Boundaries: When to Say Yes and How to Say No When You Need to,\" renowned boundaries expert Dr. John Townsend will provide clear principles and actionable skills to help you conquer these feelings and take charge of your life and your leadership.

It's easy to fall into an unhealthy cycle, which is why we recently asked the AAEP Member Vet Talk on Facebook community and members of the AAEP's Wellness Committee for their best health hack during busy days at the practice or on the road. Take steps to eat healthy Let's face it. Life on the road as an ambulatory practitio-ner often includes a pit stop at the gas station for a slice of pizza, bag of chips and an energy drink\u2014a meal not exactly conducive to one's physical wellbeing. Dr. Vasiliki Harvey in Eustis, Fla., avoids the temptation by packing her own healthy food and drinks each day and then trying to enjoy a picnic in a nice location. If unable to pack a healthy lunch, Dr. Sara Miller from Henryetta, Okla., encourages scouting out healthy eateries and parks along your practice routes. \"Know where a smoothie shop and healthy sandwich shop are at since eating on the road happens, and we're not always good at packing lunches! And knowing where the good parks are to get out of the truck for a minute and walk around helps your mental health in a busy day.\" Embrace your spiritual side Before moving from clinical practice to industry in 2020, Dr. Jamie Pribyl in Maple Lake, Minn., utilized the driving time in her truck between calls to listen to an uplifting podcast or spiritual talk. Along those lines, Dr. Stacey Cordivano in Chadds Ford, Penn., preps for or recovers from a busy day with five minutes of guided meditation from the free Insight Timer app.Meditation is among the recommendations in the AVMA's 100 Healthy Tips to Support a Culture of Wellbeing, as is experimenting with yoga, tai chi, qigong or other forms of movement that connect the body with the breath. These practices can help you relax, reduce stress and relieve anxiety. Have a little fun Dr. Aimee Eggleston Ahearn addresses her physical and emotional wellness with her choice of footwear. She sports Sanita or Dansko clogs to help alleviate foot pain, and she makes it a point to purchase fun prints for her clogs. \"Seeing the fun print peek out during the day and the compliments received from clients makes me smile and provides a quick boost to my mental/emotional wellness.\" For more healthy habits, check out the variety of wellness resources and links at aaep.org/wellness; and access the AVMA's 100 Healthy Tips to Support a Culture of Wellbeing at https://tinyurl.com/yc7v66ax.WELL nEssX AAEP News June 2022 How many equine to this 10 5/31/22 11:20 AMAAEP News June 2022 XI Dr. Scott Taylor, former AAEP board member, dies at 59 Dr. Scott Taylor, who served on the AAEP's board of directors from 2005-2007, died May 14 at age 59.

The tarsus and proximal suspensory origin of the metatarsus are commonly imaged regions lameness. Common radiographic ndings metatarsal bone (MtIII) include increased trabecular andendosteal bone density (sclerosis), areas of decreased bone density and enthesophyte formation. Single hindlimbs of 35 horses (32 Quarter Horses) with radiographic and high- eld (3Tesla (3T)) MRI studies were blindly evaluated by two board-certi ed veterinary radiologists and a radiology resident. Severity and location ofthe following parameters were assessed: radiographic MtIII sclerosis and lucent regions, MRI endosteal metatarsal and bone marrow 54% of limbs, whereas 40% of limbs had osseous changes on MRI. In addition, 43% of limbs had PSD on MRI. No signi cant association was found between the presence ofradiographic changes in MtIII and PSD on MRI. A statistically signi cant association and positive correlation were found between the severity of radiographic changes and MtIIIplantar cortical proliferation and resorption on MRI. This study found that horses with proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) had more increased radiopacity in the lateral aspect of the metatarsus and a multifocal distribution pattern was more common in hindlimbs with PSD. Comparison of radiography to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help objectively assess the value and limitations of radiographs in orthopaedic disease processes. Radiographic bony changes of proximal MtIII do not reliably predict the presence or severity of PSD but are associated with osseous changes at the proximal MtIII. The presence of radiographic changes should warrant additional diagnostics in the region prior to making conclusions about the presence or absence of PSD. 3D printed guides for keratoma removal In this short case series Adam Biedrzycki and co-workers at the University of Florida ,USA,report the technique ,surgical approach and post-operative features in horses treated via a3-dimensional (3D) printed guide-assisted keratoma resection created using imaging (MRI)-based segmentation . Five client-owned horses were placed under general anaesthesia for imaging (CT and MRI) and underwent a second anaesthesia for surgery. Two horses had guides created from CT-based imaging and three horses had guidescreated from MRI. Accurate and precise portals for keratomaremoval were created using various sized non-arbored hole saws. Surgical sites were managed until keratinised granulation tissue had formed, and the defect was sealed with an arti cial hoof wall patch. All keratomas were successfully removed as a single piece either intact with the hoof wall or easily extracted after the hoof wall portal was created. Surgery times were between 20 and 90 min. All CT created guides tted without issue; MRI-created guides required minor adjustments with aDremel device for proper t. All cases had minor debridement adjacent to P3 and circumferential lamellartissue. All horses returned to their previous levels of performance 2 -4 months post-operatively. In this study, the use of 3D printed guides led to accurate targeting of keratomas with small surgical portals and short surgical times. Due to challenges with MRI-based segmentation, CT is preferred. Navicular PaPr-PaDiO image quality Palmaroproximal-palmarodistal oblique (PaPr-PaDiO) radiographs are regularly obtained for full evaluation of the navicular bone (NB) .The aim of this in vitro experiment by Manon Peeters and co-workers at the Royal VeterinaryCollege ,UK,was to determine optimal foot placement and beam angle for obtaining PaPr-PaDiO views . A convenience sample of 26 disarticulated forelimbs was placed in six different positions using a leg press to mimic theweight bearing position. In each position, navicular PaPr- PaDiO images were obtained with eight different beam angles. The resulting 1248 radiographs were graded for their diagnostic quality and the compacta spongiosa demarcation of the NB. Diagnostic quality and compacta spongiosa demarcation was graded higher for feet positioned caudally and angles between 40 \u00b0and 45 \u00b0. Elevation of the toe signi cantly decreased obvious positive in fluence on radiographs. Caudal foot placement seems to improve image quality of the navicular PaPr-PaDiO view. The standard beam angleof 45 \u00b0appears to be the favourable angle for acquisition. Elevation of the toe, standard in most commercially availablenavicular skyline cassette holders, does not in fluence the quality. Equine (EPD) is in horses .This study by Nicola Raizner and co-workers in Germany ,USA and Switzerland assessed the risk factors for developing EPD in a large group of horses kept under the same conditions. The study also analysed whether \u00a92022 and antimicrobial agents was able to prevent the development of EPD or accelerate the healing process . Moisture and lack of pigmentation predisposed to EPD. Topical application of the tested spot-on once-weekly did not prevent the disease. A positive effect of both spot-on products on the severity of EPD lesions was detected. Age-related dental changes The aims of this retrospective review by Tiziana Liuti and co-workers in the UK were to measure the angulation of the mesial and distal cheek teeth ,quantify age-related cheek teeth mesial and distal dental drift ,and measure the cheek teeth row length in horses of different ages . Case details and computed tomographic (CT) images from clinical equine cases that had undergone standing CThead examination were collated. Three sets of measurements were acquired from each head. 'Head size' calculated as the distance between the caudal aspect of the orbit and thecaudal aspect of the naso-incisive notch, was used to standardise measurements in different sized heads. The length of the cheek teeth rows was measured from the mesial aspect of the Triadan 06 occlusal surface to the distal aspect occlusal surface. The rostrocaudal mandibular and maxillary Triadan 06 and 11 teeth were measured in relation to reference lines drawn on CT images. Signi cant mesial drift occurred in the maxillary and mandibular Triadan 11s. The upper and lower Triadan 06s also drifted mesially, despite their distal angulation of Triadan 06 and 11 mandibular teeth (17.8 and 26.2 \u00b0, respectively) was almost double that of maxillary teeth (9.2 and 13.3 \u00b0, respectively) with both Triadan 11s having greater angulation than the 06s. Cheek teeth angulation only signi cantly decreased in the mandibular 06s. Cheek teeth arcade lengths decreased with age, but these decreaseswere not signi cant. In the population of horses used for this study, age-related mesial drift occurred in both Triadan 06 and 11s, and the angulation of these teeth did not decrease with age in most arcades. CT Imaging of the head This review by US-based Susanne Stieger-Vanegas and Ashley Hanna discusses the indications ,bene ts and technical considerations for the use (CT) scanners are now more readily available, CT imaging of the head in equine patients is now commonly performed. Head CT has proven valuable in evaluating spatially complex anatomical structures where radiographic superimposition, or restricted access via endoscopy or ultrasound, limit complete evaluation of the disease process. Head CT has been demonstrated to beincredibly valuable in the evaluation of dental and paranasal sinus disease, disease of the hyoid apparatus and ear, and in the evaluation of skull trauma. CT is an excellent modality for the assessment of both osseous and soft tissue structures; however, evaluation of complex vascular anatomy and determination of tissue viability is limited without the use of contrast agents. Therefore, various contrast agent protocols including intravenous and intra-arterial iodinated contrast administration techniques have been established. CT also has limitations in the evaluation of brain and spinal cord disease, for which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has major advantages. Head CT images are most commonly evaluated in transverse planes. However, standard multiplanar reconstructions of the head including dorsal and parasagittal planes improve the understanding of spatially complex disease processes. These reconstructions can be crucial for accurate identi cation of diseased teeth and determination of the extent and severity of osseous and paranasal sinusdisease. Head CT examinations are becoming an increasingly important diagnostic tool in the evaluation of horses with head disorders, and CT imaging ndings are an important aspect of the clinical decision-making process.

Radiographs revealed the presence of osseous irregularities consistent with osteoarthritis of the MTPJ and the proximal interphalangeal joint. There were also two ovoid, osseous, fragments associated with the articular surface of the mandibular condyle and the articular tubercle of the temporal bone of the left TMJ. The horse was subjected to euthanasia as the prognosis for the intended career was poor. Computed tomography of the head, and gross post-mortem examination of the head and right hindlimb, con rmed the radiographic ndings. Further, these investigations demonstrated the severity of theanatomical changes associated with the TMJ. In addition to the osseous fragments, the shape and surface architecture of both the temporal and mandibular components of the TMJ were abnormal. Histological investigation of the TMJ abnormalities con rmed the ante-mortem suspicions that the articular fragments were comprised of cartilage and bone(Fig 1 ) similar to those reported at the distal end of theintermediate ridge of the tibia (DIRT) in horses withosteochondrosis. The possibility of these ndings being associated with an underlying inherited abnormality was givenmore credence by the fact that a 2-year-old lly from the same dam (half-sibling) had also been diagnosed with early osteoarthritis of the left TMJ and the right MTPJ at an earlier date. This case suggests that developmental orthopaedic disease, speci cally osteochondrosis-like lesions, may occur in the TMJ of horses just as it does in other joints of theappendicular skeleton. More work is needed to determine the underlying aetiology of this condition in the TMJ of horses.

Van der Vekens\u00a7 Swiss Institute of Equine Medicine, University of Bern, and Agroscope;Institute of Animal Pathology, Vetsuisse- Faculty, University of Bern; and\u00a7Division of Clinical Radiology, Department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine, Vetsuisse-Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland *Corresponding author email: nathalie.fouche@vetsuisse.unibe.ch Summary A 2-year-old Freiberger x PRE stallion was referred for evaluation of sudden onset of ataxia. Abnormal ndings in the neurological examination included a symmetricalreduction in the range of the active neck movements and proprioceptive de cits were present in both front and hindlimbs. During circling, the horse showed circumduction inthe pelvic limbs and interference in the pelvic and thoracic limbs. According to the clinical ndings, a neuro-anatomical lesion was suspected in the cervical spinal cord. Radiographsof the cervical spine showed a well-demarcated rounded osteolysis involving the vertebral body and one side of the vertebral arch of the 4th cervical vertebra the vertebral body and most right-sided components of C4, with ventral periosteal reaction and peripheral extension of the mass. The CBCT-myelography visualised extradural compression with laterolateral flattening and left dorsal displacement of the spinal cord ( Fig 1 ). Ultrasonographic examination, to further characterise themass, showed a well-bordered, heterogeneous mass on the right side of C4, extending into the vertebral canal. Considering the aggressive imaging characteristics, its location, and the mainly solid structure of the mass, vertebral neoplasia was suspected. Post-mortem examination followingeuthanasia revealed a cervical mass within the vertebral canal that originated from the body of C4 with concurrent compression of the spinal cord and osteolysis ( Fig 2 ). Histologically, this mass was composed of neoplasticmesenchymal cells displaying diverse growth patterns surrounded by small clusters of eosinophilic material resembling osteoid. A diagnosis of a central osteosarcoma of the combined-type was made for this neoplasm. Key points \u0081A primary vertebral osteosarcoma is a potential cause for ataxia in a young horse \u0081Diagnostic imaging- ideally combining different imagingmodalities (X-rays, CT, myelography, ultrasonography) if available is essential in the diagnostic workup of a horse with sudden onset of ataxia, occasionally revealing unusual ndings as in this case \u0081Post-mortem examination con rmed a neoplasia as the cause of ataxia and histopathological examination of the mass diagnosed a primary vertebral osteosarcoma, not previously described in horses Fig 1: Sagittal reconstructed CBCT-myelography image centred on C4 showing major disruption of the borders of the vertebralcanal (black arrows).

Bar 2 cm. Commentary Spinal ataxia: How to distinguish types of spinal cord compression R. E. Morgan The Royal Veterinary College, Equine Referral Hospital, Hertfordshire, UK Corresponding author email: rmorgan@rvc.ac.uk Keywords: horse; spinal ataxia; spinal cord compression In cases of suspected spinal ataxia, a thorough clinical examination, including a neurological examination, complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry and, if indicated, cerebrospinal fluid evaluation (CSF) or testing for infectious diseases, will be undertaken (Furr, 2015). The neurologicalexamination aims to neurolocalise the cause of ataxia; if the cranial nerve responses are normal, brain and brainstem lesions are less likely. Further neurolocalisation will aim to differentiate between a lesion of the cervical or thoracolumbar spine. Once the area of interest has been identi ed, radiographs, computed tomography (CT), myelography and in some cases magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) can help determine the nature of the lesion. This clinical commentary will focus on focal lesions of the spinal canal as a cause of spinal ataxia, similar to the primaryvertebral osteosarcoma in a 2-year-old colt, reported by Fouch /C19e et al. (2022). Lesions of the spinal canal can be classi ed with respect to their location in comparison with the dura mater; intramedullary (affecting the spinal cord), intradural-extramedullary (affecting the nerve sheath and meninges) or extradural (due to constituents of the vertebral column and associated soft tissues). Horses most commonly experience extradural compression of the spinal cord, often caused by cervical vertebral stenotic myelopathy (CVSM) (Hales et al., 2021). This typically results in narrowing of the vertebral canal and subsequent spinal cord compression. Dynamic (type I) CVSM is usually seen in younger animals whilst static (type II) is seen in older animals (Szklarz et al., 2018). Dynamic CVSM occurs when one vertebra moves independently of the adjacent vertebrae due to instability, subsequently narrowing the vertebral canal lumen and causing spinal cord impingement (Fig 1 ). This is most common at C3-C4 followed by C4-C5 and recognised when the cervical spine is either flexed or extended (Nout & Reed, 2003). Other characteristics such as dorsal laminar extension, caudal epiphyseal flare or abnormal ossication patterns may exacerbate the condition (Piercy, 2011). Static CVSM results in constant spinal cord impingement and can be caused by enlargement of the articular process joints, subsequently narrowing the vertebral canal lumen. This is often secondary to osteoarthritis, and proliferation of periarticular tissues or synovial cysts can also contribute. This is most commonly seen at C5-C7 and can be exacerbated when the horse extends its neck (Piercy, 2011). Extradural compression can also be caused by haemorrhage haematoma formation (vascular), abscess, empyema or granuloma (in flammatory and infectious), fracture or luxation (traumatic and developmental), primary or secondary neoplasia, or degenerative conditions such as intervertebral disc degeneration. Other than CVSM, there is a lack of high-powered scienti c studies regarding extradurallesions in the horse. There are numerous case reports of extradural compression causing spinal ataxia, including synovial cysts (Fisher & Bowman, 1981), ligamentum al., 2021) and intervertebral disc protrusion. Neoplasia of the cervical vertebrae has been reported to cause extradural spinal cord compression, including haemangiosarcoma (Hirsch et al., 2009; Newton-Clarke et al., 1994), osteochondroma (Dixon & Anderson, 2021) and vertebral angiosarcoma (Kennedy & Brown, 1993). of the cervical spine at C3-C5, in (a) neutral and (b) flexed positions. This one- year-old Warmblood gelding had grade 3 ataxia in all four limbs.In a flexed position, the vertebral canal narrows at C4-C5, demonstrated by a 24% decrease in total dural diameter (DD)and a 56.5% decrease in dorsal myelographic column or meningioma. Reports of rare in the horse and include arachnoid diverticulum (Allison & Moeller, 2000), neuro broma tumour) (Civello et al., 2017) and intradural lymphoma(Finding conditions such as gliomas, lymphoma, ependymomas or metastatic disease. Reports of intramedullary lesions spinal ataxia in the horse include metastatic intramedullary melanoma (Rodriguez et al., 1998), brocartilaginous embolic myelopathy (Sebastian & Giles, 2004) and syringohydromyelia(Sponseller et al., 2011). However, this list is far from exhaustive; there are many other reports of infectious and inflammatory myelopathies. Diagnostic imaging forms an important part of the investigation. Plain radiographs are a useful rst-line modality. If an aggressive is present, cortical bone lysis, periosteal proliferation and an ill-de ned transition zone (border between healthy and diseased bone). These are critical signs of an aggressivebone lesion, which could indicate neoplasia or osteomyelitis.Further characteristics such as monostotic vs. polyostotic can aid interpretation; however, the assumption that primary bone tumours cannot cross joints or invade adjacent bones is less likely but not impossible (Thrall, 2017). A space-occupying lesion can cause smoothly marginated foraminal enlargement; the increased cross-sectional area of a peripheral nerve sheath tumour can cause pressure remodelling and subsequent enlargement of the intervertebral foramen. However, many soft tissue lesions do not cause bone changes and are therefore dif cult to diagnose on radiographs. Radiographic and computed tomographic myelography enable the border of the spinal cord (or pia matersurrounding the spinal cord) to be visualised. Positive contrast media is administered into the subarachnoid space (between the dura and pia mater), after CSF has been removed. Poor lling around the spinal cord can occur due to an inadequate volume, contrast injection into the epiduralspace or surrounding soft tissues, pooling in the dependent aspect of the canal or due to proximity of the region of interest from the site of injection. The shape of the contrast columns surrounding the spinal cord can be characteristic for a) C5 C6b) c)d) e) Fig 2: A 6-year-old Cob gelding suffering recurrent episodes of ataxia in all four limbs, with reduced neck flexion bilaterally underwent computed tomographic examination of the cervical spine under general anaesthesia. Images (a) and (b) are transverse and dorsal reconstructions at C5/C6, respectively, in a bone setting (Window Level 800 HU, Window Width 2800 HU). There is a soft tissueattenuating mass (arrow heads) within the left ventrolateral aspect of the vertebral canal, narrowing (tapering) the adjacentmyelographic contrast column and flattening the border of the spinal cord. The articular process joints were moderately enlarged, most pronounced on the left which is contacting the C5 vertebral body and narrowing the C5/C6 intervertebral foramen (arrow).Polyradiculoneuropathy was present within the left C6 spinal nerve root, diagnosed via histopathology.

Images (d) and (e) are dorsal and transverse reconstructions of the same horse at C3/C4, respectively. There is a largeperiarticular osteophyte (arrows) protruding from the left cranial process of C4 into the vertebral canal, focally narrowing themyelographic contrast column which is likely causing extradural impingement of the spinal cord. The left side of the horse is on theright side of the image. intraduralextramedullary intradural lesions (Diaz, 2005). Extradural lesions are usually asymmetrical and will displace the spinal cord in the direction opposite to the position of the mass ( Fig 2 ). As they have compressed the spinal cord against the vertebral canal, the contrast columnstaper off circumferentially. Fouch /C19e et al. (2022) demonstrated this pattern well in all planes in Figure 4, and myelographyfacilitated assessment of the degree of spinal cord compression. Intradural-extramedullary lesions will produce a 'golf-tee 'sign at the location of the lesion ( Fig 3 ). This is due to the location of the lling defect between the spinal cord and the dura mater, within the subarachnoid space. The contrast column on the contralateral side will taper, due to the lesion displacing the spinal cord in the opposite direction. This was demonstrated in a previous case report describing intradural-extramedullary lymphoma in a pony at T11-T12 (Finding et al., 2014). An intramedullary lesion will be symmetrical/central, and the contrast column will taper circumferentially due to enlargement of the spinal cord. Radiographic and CT myelography can also help considerably in diagnosing CSVM ( Fig 1 ). Flexed, neutral and extended laterolateral radiographs can indicate sites of dynamic instability leading to extradural spinal cord impingement. A reduction in the total dural diameter of >20%, the dorsal myelographic column of >50% or a reduction to <2 mm of the dorsal myelographic column can indicate an extradural compression of the cervical spine (Mayhew & de la Hunta, 1978; Nyland et al., 1980; Van Biervliet et al., 2004). At the cervicothoracic junction, slightly different parameters have been found which avoid high numbers of false positives. This is thought to be necessary due to the larger intravertebral measurement at C7. These criteria include a reduction in the total dural diameter by 30% or reduction of the dorsal myelographic column by 60% (Estell et al., 2018). Additionally, in cases of static CSVM, CT myelography can demonstrate changes such as narrowingof lateral myelographic columns due to articular process jointenlargements. Axial extension of periarticular osteophytes of the APJs protruding into the vertebral canal can be visualised, along with many other vertebral changes demonstrated on CT ( Fig 2d,e). Intra- and intervertebral sagittal diameter ratios can be measured using plainradiographs (Hahn et al., 2008; Moore et al., 1994), and cord canal diameters on CT (Yamada et al., 2016) and MRI (Janes et al., 2014). These parameters can help predict a site of cervical vertebral stenosis. Research is constant in this eld, and with the cutting- edge progression of diagnostic imaging modalities, possibilities for investigating pathology of the vertebral column are sure to be ongoing.

Lindt,A .E Malbon\u00a7and M. A. Jackson* Equine Department, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich;Clinic of Diagnostic Imaging, Department of Small Animals, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich; and\u00a7Institute of Veterinary Pathology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Noriker lly presented with severe angular limb deformities of both third metatarsi (MtIII) at the level of the distal epiphysis. Lameness examination showed a moderate lameness in both hindlimbs and hyper flexion with reduced range of motion of the metatarsophalangeal joints (MTPJ). Radiography and computed tomography (CT) were used to diagnose a varus deformity of the right (approx. 42 \u00b0) and valgus deformity of the left MTPJ (approx. 39 \u00b0) with associated bilateral physitis and mild osteoarthritis (OA). Since the foal was already 8 months old at the time of admission and osseous growth likely terminated, a correctiveclosing wedge ostectomy was chosen as the therapeuticapproach. The intention was to correct the deformities, aid the return to full locomotion and prevent further OA to the MTPJ. The orthopaedic surgery was planned and rehearsed using three-dimensional (3D) bone models. For osteosynthesis, human 3.5-mm LCP /C226medial distal tibia plates were used bilaterally. The surgery was successful, and substantialcorrection of the initial deformities could be achieved. What followed was a relatively long and complicated convalescence. This included increased pain, a partial unilateral implant failure and aggravated OA and hyperextension of the MTPJ. Strict pain management, frequent monitoring of the healing progress with blood tests and radiographic studies and the temporary application oftrans xation casts were measures taken to overcome these complications. The lly was hospitalised for a total duration of 14 weeks and nal radiographs revealed progressive healing of the ostectomy, upon which the sound foal was discharged. Follow-up radiographs taken 1.5 years later revealed complete osseous bridging of the ostectomies and stableimplants. Mild hyperextension of both MTPJ and moderate OA in the joints was present. The mare was used as a therapy horse for the disabled, which involved light work. At present, the mare is sound in all gaits and the chosen approach, including the application of an LCP /C226medial distal tibia plate to stabilise the ostectomy, appears to be appropriate fortreating severe ALD in horses ( Figs 1 and 2). Key points \u0081The combination of radiography and CT imaging with 3D bone models is advantageous in the planning and rehearsingof complex orthopaedic surgeries. \u0081Ethics plays a role in deciding whether to treat complex andsevere ALD in horses, but selected cases can be treated withsuccess. \u0081A human 3.5-mm LCP/C226medial distal tibia plate is ideal for application to the MtIII in horses. It matches the distal extremity ofthe bone and combines a dynamic compression unit with lockingscrew holes in the shaft and distal combi holes which provide extra flexibility of axial compression and locking capability.

Additionally, the term 'displacement osteotomy 'is de ned as: the surgical division of a bone and shifting of the divided ends to change the alignment of the bone or to alter weight-bearing stresses . Therefore, displacement ostectomy/osteotomy (OE/OO) arethe correct terms for the type of technique discussed by Lindt et al . (2022) and in this Clinical Commentary. The following indications for displacement OE/OO exist. Foals with a persisting angular limb deformity after the growth plate has closed (Butler et al . 2017), foals with metaphyseal angular deformities, correction of residual deformities afterfracture healing has occurred and angular limb deformities caused by partial articular collapse as a result of chronic degenerative joint disease (DJD). The latter occurs mainly in Thoroughbred and Standardbred broodmares. A good physical examination is a prerequisite for a displacement OE/OO. These techniques are elective procedures and should be carried out on healthy patients with good weight bearing and no other abnormal changes inthe musculoskeletal system \u2014or any other system. A detailed radiographic and, preferably, a computer tomographic (CT)examination are important to fully understand all planes (varus/valgus in the frontal plane, anticurvatum/procurvatum in the sagittal plane, or rotational deformation in thetransverse plane) of the deformity, which is crucial for preoperative planning (see later). Additionally, the adjacent joints and bones should also be evaluated precisely because of the potential presence of an opposing deformity, as is the case frequently with metaphyseal deformities in the third metacarpal/metatarsal (McIII/MtIII) bone with an adjacent deformity in the proximal phalanx ( Fig 1 ). Careful planning is important. In simple deviations, the pivot point, in more complicated deformities involving several planes, the point of maximal deformity, as well as the correction angle for the correction of the deformity has to be identi ed. The technique to be applied should be mastered by the surgeon and if not, it should be practiced prior to theactual surgery on cadaveric limbs or even better on 3D prints of the deformed bone. The latter requires a CT study, which data serve as basis for the 3D print. All equipment necessary for the procedure, including an oscillating saw offering different sawing actions, a wide variety of implants such as screws in different lengths (3.5 mm -5.5 mm) and type (cortex \u2014and locking head screws) as well as standard plates in different lengths are required. If the osteotomy leaves a shortfragment, special plates allowing multiple screws to beinserted in one end are preferred. A template of the angle of the bone wedge to be removed should be prepared and sterilised to apply during the surgical procedure. The deformed bone should be prepared for aseptic surgery overits entire length, possibly including the adjacent joint, and covered circumferentially using an adhesive see-through drape 1. Surgical techniques In this section, the approach to the bone, and the mostfrequently applied OE/OO (wedge-, and the step Fig 1: Dorsopalmar radiographic view of the metacarpophalangeal region of a 4-month-old foal. The limb isstraight but the metacarpal epiphysis has a wedgedappearance, which is offset by a wedged appearance of theproximal phalanx in the opposite direction leading to an obliquearticular orientation. Ideally, the imaginary lines along themetacarpal physis, metacarpophalangeal will be discussed. Each of these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages, which will be discussed later. Surgical approach Dependent upon the deformity to be corrected and the typeof correction to be performed, it is advisable to perform a relatively large incision to allow visualisation of the bone over a greater area and possibly the adjacent joint. In the cases of OE/OO of the distal McIII/MtIII, the foot is draped circumferentially as well. It is important for the surgeon to appreciate the contour of the foot, which helps him/her in the correction of the deformity. Wherever possible, the periosteum is left intact with the bone to keep interference with post-operative 'fracture '-healing to a minimum. The previously determined pivot point for the surgical correction isidenti ed on the bone. Wedge ostectomy The wedge is usually removed at the level of the pivot point or slightly more proximal to it, perpendicular relative to the long axis of the limb. Two saw cuts are necessary, one perpendicular relative to long axis of McIII/MtIII and the other perpendicular relative to long axis of the proximal phalanx (in the case of deformity at the metacarpo/ metatarsophalangeal joint [MCPJ/MTPJ] region). It is advisable not to completely sever the bone but to leave at the shorter side of the bone a small bone bridge, which then can be 'greenstick-fractured 'during correction of the deformity. This allows some support of the fragments until theimplants can be inserted following correction of the deformity (Fig 2 ).Step ostectomy The initial drilling of a 4 mm hole is prepared through thepivot point, and a second drill hole of the same diameter is placed axially 2 to 3 cm more proximally in the same bone is optional. The two drill holes serve as a stress reliever at the corners of the step ostectomy. The bone (between the drill holes) is rst severed with the oscillating saw in a sagittal plane. The template with the predetermined correction angleis placed with one side over the osteotomy, and a second osteotomy is performed along the other side of the template (Fig 3a ). The horizontal cuts are made, one medially and one laterally severing the entire bone and allowing the removal ofthe centrally located wedge. The Z-plasty is then reduced, which should result in a correct axial alignment of the bone. The saw cuts are cleaned and, with the help of the pointed reduction forceps, the bone is maintained in reduction. The bone wedge removed may be inserted in gaps between the osteotomy incisions, which developed during the alignment of the bone. Minor adjustments with a chisel or the oscillating saw may be required to facilitate a perfect bone-plate interface. In foals, the bone plate is applied to the lateral side (in a varus deformity). In an adult horse, it is advisable to apply double plating (one plate medially and the other dorsolaterally). The screws crossing the vertical osteotomy are inserted in lag fashion. Any rotational deformity present may be corrected by cutting an additional wedge from the dorsal cortex along the vertical osteotomy plane. The rotational alignment is then achieved ( Fig 3b ). Step osteotomy The step osteotomy is performed using the same technique but in the frontal plane. No wedge is removed and the fragments can be aligned through rotational movement, internal xation is easily applied from the dorsal aspect of the bone ( Fig 4 ). Again, in an adult horse double plating is advisable (one plate dorsomedially and the other dorsolaterally). Additionally, separate cortex screws can be inserted between the plates in lag fashion. Discussion Displacement OE/OO represent relatively rare surgicalinterventions in the equine species, and therefore, the number of publications discussing these techniques is small and consists mainly of case reports or small series of cases. Only very few osseous deformities in horses occur in the diaphyseal region of the long bones; most of them are found in distal metaphysis, with the distal McIII/MtIII being by far the most affected bone. Therefore, this bone is selected for the subsequent discussion. The majority of deformities present in this location are aligned along the frontal plane caused by lateral-to-medial asymmetrical growth at the level of the physis, possibly in association with minor axial rotational deformity. Luckily, signi cant rotational deviations are rarely encountered because they would be dif cult to correctly assess radiographically alone (Piras et al . 2012). Every now and again a deformity in the sagittal plane is encountered, suchas in the case described by Lindt et al . (2022) in this issue. These deformities are thought to be part of the physitis complex and possibly associated with Salter 2011). Severe deformities in the diaphyseal region are Fig 2: Artist drawing of a wedge ostectomy in the distal metacarpal region. Left preoperative planning of the osteotomies;right situation of frequently associated with additional axial rotational deviations ( Fig 5 ). This multidirectional deformity affects all three planes (sagittal, frontal and transverse) and is bestcorrected with a single cut osteotomy (Schweinsberger et al . 2021). The nal group involves angular limb deformities caused by partial collapse of a joint region affected by chronic degenerative disease and continuous overload(Bramlage and Auer 2006). These deformities are associated with chronic, severe pain. The only reason to treat these patients is, to render them pain-free with the help of an arthrodesis in association with a displacement OE ( Fig 6 ).The surgeon can select from among the previously discussed treatment techniques. In simple cases, thedescribed techniques can be applied one to one. In more complicated cases, a combination of two of the techniques may need to be applied. Ideally, the correction should occur at the level of the pivot point. However, it is advisable to move the OE/OO slightly more proximal, especially in the distal McIII/MtIII region to facilitate post-correction internal xation. The newly developed Equine T-plate 2may then be applied to the dorsal aspect, signi cantly improving the stability of the construct. The closing wedge ostectomy is easy to plan. Intraoperatively, however, dif culties can arise because once the wedge is excised, the two bone ends can be arranged ina multitude of con gurations, except a little bone hinge is left at the side of the pointed edge (Fretz and McIllwraith 1983).This hinge prevents free rotation of the bone fragments and aids in the selection of the correct anatomical arrangement and its maintenance until it can be xed in position by means of implants. One of the advantages of this technique is thefact that in addition to angular deformities, rotational deviations can also be corrected at the same time. However, it is very dif cult to achieve solid interfragmentary screw xation because of the extremely acute angle at which these implants have to be inserted. Tightening them may lead to signi cant fragment displacement, which is prevented by the application of bone plates. In mostinstances, the internal xation is insuf cient, therefore requiring some type of post-operative external coaptation. The closingwedge ostectomy leads to shortening of the bone, which is a minor problem in horses, but could have led to marked weak angle in the MTPJ angle in the case described by Lindt et al. (2022). In people, the opening wedge osteotomy is described and relatively frequently applied to the proximal tibia to correct a genu valgum (Kwun et 2017). In this technique, single transverse osteotomy is performed followed bypushing the proximal fragment proximally until the desired a) b) Fig 3: a) Artist drawing of step ostectomy in the distal metacarpal region.

Ltd293 june 2022 angle is achieved and xing it in this position with a specially designed plate (Kwun et al . 2017). Through this technique, the bone is actually lengthened, but because of the insuf cient stability of the construct, this technique is notfeasible in the horse and therefore will not be further discussed here. The step ostectomy is more dif cult to plan and the procedure requires a skilled surgeon, familiar with the task at hand, to assure the desired result. Most of these procedures are performed on the McIII/MtIII where protection of the palmar/plantar anatomical structures is of great importance (Epp 2007). Inadvertent transection of one or both of the vestigial metacarpal/metatarsal bones is a minor problem and if one or both are inadvertently transected during the osteotomy, the distal fragments can be surgically excised (Jackson and Auer, 2019). Because of the central vertical OO interfragmentary screw xation is easily and effectively achieved orthogonally relative to the sagittal OO. The screwsmay even be inserted through the plate. An additional advantage of this technique involves the proximal extension of the distal fragment on one side of the bone, allowing additional screws to be placed across it. As mentioned before, a potential axial rotational deviation can easily be corrected in a second step by removing a vertical wedge with the broad side being located at the dorsal surface of the bone (see Fig 3b ) (Getman 2011). The bone length is maintained (Getman 2011). The step osteotomy represents a Z-plasty of the bone in the region of the deformity. The planning is not very dif cult but the protection of the palmar/plantar anatomical structures requires special attention and special equipment. For this technique, a reciprocal oscillating saw 2is required, which demands less dissection and displacement of the palmar/plantar structures during the osteotomy of palmar/plantar cortex. The proximal horizontal osteotomy should be located palmarly/plantarly to prevent inadvertent trauma to the MCPJ/MTCJ palmar/plantar pouch, which extends proximally from the joint level (see Fig 4 ). In this technique, no bone wedge needs to be excised, as followingall three osteotomies, the two fragments can merely be rotated into axial alignment (Bischofberger and Auer 2019). As in the step ostectomy, the bone length in the step osteotomy is maintained. Once the OOs are performed, the two fragments can be moved into alignment. The next step involves the bone preparation for plate attachment, which may require minor adjustments of the bone surface with the help of a chisel or the oscillating saw. Preoperative planning of the displacement OE/OO is one of the key elements for a successful outcome. Originally, planning consisted of placement of an acetate foil over a radiograph and tracing the outline of the deformed bone. In a second step, the ostectomy lines were traced onto the foil and the correction angle determined based on CT data. With CT 3-dimensional (3-D) imaging, reconstruction was possible and the actual deformity could be visualised full circle allowing for a more complete appreciation of the deformity, a signi cant advantage over radiographs alone (Apelt et al . 2005). Obviously, axial torsional deviations could also be recognised in detail, again a signi cant improvement over 2-D imaging (Dismukes et al . 2008; Tack et al . 2016). Up until recently, the actual preoperative practising of the surgical intervention was only possible on cavaderic limbs orplastic bones, but these specimens do usually not contain the exact deformity to be corrected. The appreciation ofcomplex deformities involving angular and rotational components bene ts from image reconstruction a) b) Fig 6: a) Dorsoplamar radiographic view of the left carpal region of a 10-year-old mare with a partial collapse of the lateral aspectof the middle carpal joint associated with exuberant callusformation in an attempt to ancylose the joint. b) Post-operativedorsopalmar radiographic view of the horse following wedgeostectomy in the middle carpal joint and partial carpalarthrodesis with the help of the Dynamic Compression Plates(DCPs).

Schramme, R.K.W. Smith and S. May, Royal Veterinary june 2022(Vroemen et al. 2013). The subsequent development of CT- imaging-based 3-D printing of patient-speci c specimen bone models represents a big step forward. On these models, the exact displacement OE/OO can be practiced hands-on and is nowadays strongly recommended in human surgery (Franklin et al. 2017; Kwun et al . 2017; Winer et al . 2017; Lau et al . 2018). Recently, reports of using this technique in veterinary medicine have been published (Radtke et al . 2021). Being able to rehearse the actual correction results in a shorter surgery time and increased accuracy (Lindt et al . 2022) and aids in the selection of the best implants,especially for more complex and multiplanar osteotomies (Lau et al 2018; Schweinsberg et 2021). Since most deformities develop in the metaphysis of the long bones, their internal xation following correction is a major concern. The small distal fragment can only host a fewscrews, jeopardising the stability of the implant construct. To add additional screws on either side of the plate(s) may add some stability. One key element of the internal xation involves interfragmentary xation, preferably using a lag technique (Auer 2019). The more orthogonal osteotomy crossing angle of the screws, the more effective the implants are. Again, because of the location and con guration of the OE/OO, it is rarely possible to apply two plates at right anglesrelative to each other along the bone, which comprises one of the standard basic rules for internal xation in horses (Auer 2019). The introduction of the locking implants in the early 2000s signi cantly changed internal xation in people (Frigg, 2001; Sommer et al . 2003; Wagner 2006). It did not take long for these plates to be successfully introduced into equine veterinary surgery (Florin et al . 2005; Auer 2006; Levine et al . 2007). A multitude of special locking plates has beendeveloped for humans, which allow the insertion of multiple locking head screws (LHS) in one end of the plate (Synthes 2015; Auer 2019). These plates are ideal for application in the situation of displacement OR/OO in the metaphysis in horses.Several of the holes contain stacked locking technologyallowing either standard compression screw \u2014as well as LHS insertion. Diaphyseal and articular ostectomies usually can bexed with a standard double plating technique because there is ample bone on either side of the surgery site to allowenough screws to be inserted ( >4 on either side) (White 1983; Auer 2006). With the introduction of the locking technology, the discussion whether to apply narrow 4.5 mm \u2014or broad 3.5 mm LCPs, in foals, was activated. With the narrow 4.5 mm LCP, stronger but less screws can be inserted, these screws are all aligned in one line, and less metal is surrounding the plate holes, whereas the broad 3.5 mm LCP being manufactured from the identical plate stock contains more screw holes, of smaller diameter. The screw holes are arranged in two parallel lines and because of the smaller screw diameter more metal is surrounding them, compared to the 4.5 mm implant (Auer 2019). It is up to the surgeon to make the selection. One key principle during displacement OE/OO in horses must be followed: the caudal cortex of the two fragments must have bone-to-bone contact ( Fig 7 ) (Auer 2019). If that is not the case, cyclic loading during ambulation, even if thelimb is protected in an external coaptation cast, leads to screw breakage and potentially to construct failure (Nunamaker 2020). In bilateral deformities needing displacement OE/OO, there is always the question whether to perform bothsurgeries at the same time or one after the other. The obvious bene t of performing both interventions at the same time, possibly in two teams simultaneously, is cost reduction andpotential prevention of construct overload on the rst surgery site when after a certain time the surgery on the other limb isperformed. On the other hand, rarely does the patient load both limbs identically after bilateral surgery, leading again to potential construct overload on one limb associated with implant breakage and partial breakdown of the construct, 18.7.98 6.8.986.8.98 18.7.98a) b) c) Fig 7: a) Dorsopalmar (left) and lateromedial (right) radiographic views of the distal radius in an adult horse showing a varus deformation as the result of a conservatively treated distal radius fracture when the animal was a foal. b) Immediate post-operativeradiographic views (dorsopalmar left and lateromedial right) following step osteotomy and double plate xation.

Lindt et al . (2022) had to deal with. So, in the end, most likely, it did not make much nancial difference in the case reported (Lindt et al . 2022). The main thing is that the animal can be used for the purpose intended. Finally, these authors would like to propose an alternate option to treat the deformity described by Lindt et al . (2022). A closing wedge ostectomy where the osteotomies are created with a curved saw blade: a double dome osteotomy. The dome osteotomy has been described in the veterinary literature (Auer 2000). The tibial plateau levelling osteotomy (TLPO) technique for the surgical management of cranial ligament rupture in dogs was originally described asclosing wedge ostectomy of the proximal tibia (Slocum 1983).Over the years the technique has been modi ed to a dome osteotomy of the proximal most aspect, allowing the articularpart of the proximal tibia to be rotated in a cranial direction, such that the tibial plateau comes to lie horizontally, offsetting the caudal tibial thrust that led to the rupture (Talaat et al . 2006; Weh et al . 2011). The tibia is subsequently xed in this position with the specially designed TPLO-LCP 2. During the development of the technique, special instruments were designed to streamline the surgery. One of them is the 'crescentic Saw Blades '2varying in radius between 15 and 30 mm and attaching to a battery-powered or air-driven drill2 a) b) Fig 8: a) A Crescentic Saw Blade2attached to the Synthes Small Battery Drive2.

Additionally, a jig is available that xes a saw blade guide to the bone in question facilitating a precise osteotomy ( Fig 8b ) (Synthes 2013). These two instruments would serve equine surgeons well to perform the above-mentioned dome wedge osteotomy. After reduction of the angular deviation, the palmarly/plantarly rotated distal fragment can be rotated in a dorsal direction along the arc to its normal anatomical position ( Fig 9 ). Vezzoni et al . (2020) described a case series of dogs suffering from tibial valgusdeformity in conjunction with cranial cruciate rupture. A medial crescentic closing wedge ostectomy allowed correction of the valgus deformity and tibial plateau levelling simultaneously. This technique prevents the need for a second ostectomy and assures good bone-to-bone contact. The corrected osteotomy can be xed by means of an equine T-plate 2(Lischer et al . 2019) tibia plate without tab (Synthes 2015) laterally. The concentration of many screws in a small bone area may be problematic. Therefore, the surgeon has to use his/her skills and judgement to decide which screws to insert and which holes to leave empty. Additional cortex screws can be inserted from dorsoproximal to distoplantar on either side of the T-Plate to achieve interfragmentary xation. Such a construct would allow weight bearing in conjunction withsome external coaptation. This construct has not been implemented but could be easily tested in vitro with a sample of the 3-D patient-speci c stereolithographic bone model used by Lindt et al . (2022).

Cullimore Ascot Seven focal peritarsal infection with concurrent long digital extensor tendon sheath (LoDETS) tenosynovitis were diagnosed at a West Australian equine clinic between 2016 and 2019. Five cases presented within 6 months in 2016, the remaining two in 2018. All cases were racing Thoroughbreds between the ages of 2 and 4 years. All presented with severe acute onset hindlimb lameness and focal, exquisitely painful dorsal tarsal swelling. All cases underwent tarsal ultrasonography which revealed diffuse thickening of the subcutaneous and peritendinous tissues, as well as increased hypoechoic synovial fluid volume within the LoDETS and 1 ). Ultrasound-guided sampling of LoDETS synovial fluid was undertaken and all cases demonstrated elevation in one or more of the following:nucleated cell count, neutrophil percentage or total protein. Six cases were subsequently diagnosed with concurrent LoDETS sepsis based on synovial fluid analysis. Aerobic culture was performed in three cases but no bacterial growth wasidenti ed. Treatment in all cases consisted of a combination of systemic and local antimicrobial therapy, includingintravenous regional perfusion and intrasynovial medication of the LoDETS. Parenteral antimicrobials used consisted of various combinations mg/kg bwt per os b.i.d.) was instituted in all cases following an initial course of parenteral antimicrobials. Antimicrobials used regionally included ceftiofur mg), gentamicin (200 mg -1 g), cephazolin (1 g) and benzylpenicillin (1 -3 g). Duration of antimicrobial treatment ranged from 15 to 33 days, with two horses (Cases 6 and 7) euthanised prior to treatment completion due to complicating factors, at days 30 and 25, respectively. Lameness resolved completely in the ve surviving horses. Key points \u0081Concurrent LoDETS sepsis is believed to be a novel nding in cases of focal peritarsal cellulitis \u0081Ultrasound and synovial fluid analysis are important aspects of diagnostic work-up in these cases \u0081Prognosis for resolution of peritarsal cellulitis withconcurrent LoDETS tenosynovitis is considered good with early diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial treatment. a) b) Fig 1: Transverse ultrasound images of two cases showing thickening of subcutaneous tissues (star) and increased LoDETS synovial fluid volume (arrow); marked in (a) and mild in (b). \u00a92021 Commentary Identifying infections in synovial structures \u2014When will the Cavalry arrive? E. N. Adam Maxwell H Gluck Equine Research Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, 40511, USA *Corresponding author email: emma@emmaadam.com Case reports can be immensely challenging articles to write and get published. Set against a backdrop of a busy clinical caseload, owners 'nancial constraints and treatment prior to referral, there are often insurmountable methodologicalpitfalls. The need to describe and share clinical experience and novel case ndings is nevertheless crucial to progress. The tenacity and diligence of practitioners putting casereports together should be commended, even if there maybe aspects of case management that we might do differently with the bene t of hindsight. Being able to pull out the 'hindsight perspectives 'by de nition means that we are not accepting of mediocrity, nor are we shying away from best practice evidence-based medicine. Far from it, there are clinical scenarios that cannot be replicated experimentally from a biological, ethical or nancial perspective. Presented in this issue, Kalka et al . (2022) discuss a series of seven challenging cases diagnosed with focal peritarsalcellulitis and long digital extensor tenosynovitis. Aspects of these fascinating cases have been presented for us that may directly in fluence the way we practice veterinary medicine and the information we can offer to our clients helping themto make informed decisions. The aspects of these cases that constitute such gems are what we can learn from the two horses that were subjected to euthanasia, the challenges of synovial fluid analysis and that in none of the horses was septic tenosynovitis con rmed by bacteriological culture. From this report and previous reports, the utility of diagnostic ultrasound imaging cannot be underestimated(Fjordbakk et al . 2008; Vyetrogon and Dubois 2018). It can be a signi cant challenge to patiently perform a comprehensive ultrasound examination on an extremely painful horse. With a knowledge of anatomy and con dence in appropriate analgesia for the horse, the operator can be veryimaginative with the use of the ultrasound probe to generate myriad images for interpretation. The authors share that experience and provide excellent imagery in the report. They go on to discuss one horse who developed subchondral lysis in the medial trochlear ridge of the talus on Day 25 when re- presented for a recurrence of lameness. Together with tarsocrural joint fluid analysis, a working diagnosis of joint sepsis and septic osteomyelitis was made. The horse was subjected to euthanasia due to nancial constraints and prognosis. This is a scenario we have all faced, and an'armchair 'clinician reading this report could easily suggest that repeat radiographs at the time of admission should havebeen performed. Hindsight is indeed 20:20, and we can ask ourselves whether that lesion would have been evident at that time given the lag between bony damage and radiographic changes. However, what can be taken away from this is that we have some corroborative evidence toprovide owners within support of performing or repeatingsuch imaging. Additionally, the mindset engaged when using our ultrasound probe to derive the best images must also be applied to obtaining radiograph images as these authors point out when describing their detection of the lytic bony lesion radiographically. The authors describe their attempts at synoviocentesis of the distended sheath of the long digital extensor tendon prioritising small volumes of fluid for cytological examination over bacteriological culture. That practical decision wasperhaps based on knowledge that synovial fluid culture can, unfortunately, be a low-yield test. False-negative diagnoses ofjoint infections or synovial infections in veterinary or human patients can carry grave consequences. The authors describe techniques that provide supportive evidence for a diagnosis of sepsis such as cytological examination of fluid, total protein concentrations, synovial fluid serum amyloid A concentrations and glucose concentration. In humans, a recent study demonstrated encouraging patient side results using test strips for semi-quantitative analysis of leucocyte esterase and glucose concentrations in joint fluid from suspected septic arthritis patients presenting for emergencycare (Kolbeck et al . 2021). This interesting application requires only a small drop of fluid. Combining leucocyte esterase and glucose test strip results detected septic arthritis with 100% speci city and 85% sensitivity and had a 100% and 98% positive and negative predictive values, respectively. Supportive information in the moment is vital, but it remains very disappointing that microbial culture can be a low-yield endeavour in cases of suspected synovial infection. Pressure to identify causative organisms has increased as our needs to justify antimicrobial therapy and improve antimicrobial stewardship grow. However, that lofty goal is impossible without a reliable avenue to de ne the bacteria involved. Instead, we are left with 'best guess 'use of the antimicrobial drugs we have to hand in an attempt to prevent a suspected synovial infection claiming the life or athletic career of our patient. The rst step of course involves actually obtaining a sample. The authors described dif culty in obtaining a fluid sample, something very familiar to every practitioner. However, bringing this observation to thereader 's attention is a very important one because it opens up two big questions: the rst is as follows: Are the suspected infective agents we seek truly planktonic? The second is as follows: Has fluid analysis seduced us and our laboratory colleagues into 'settling 'forfluid and not pursuing brinous debris or synovial membrane samples? Our familiarity with bacteria existing as planktonic individuals we now know to be naive, with the term bio lm being rmly xed in our minds these days, we have altered our view somewhat. The great van Leeuvanhoek around \u00a92021 was likely the rst person to describe bio lm as he examined under his microscope a flake of his own dental calculus and described cells in a plaque. The transition from free- floating cells to cells encased in an extracellular matrix and operating cooperatively is now much better understood(Garrett et al. 2008; Cai 2020). The current dogma of bio lm being the 'predominant lifestyle of bacteria in natural settings 'was recently challenged by the description of nonsurface associated 'aggregates 'being the 'ubiquitous third lifestyle '(Cai 2020). When re flecting on these thoughts, it becomes less surprising that synovial fluid can be a low-yield test. Add to that the biological phenomena of increased adhesion of bacteria to in flamed epithelium, activated platelets increasing some Staphylococcus spp. adhesionproperties, and the demonstration that hyaluronic acid enhances Gram-positive bio lm formation (de Schilcher and Horswill 2020) and it becomes more compelling to rejoice that the synoviocentesisneedle is plugged with debris or tissue as that sample could be exactly what is required. Indeed, investigations dealing with the dire problem of periprosthetic joint infections have amounted a body of evidence supporting the sonication of fluid samples and maceration of tissue samples prior to culture to increase bacterial culture yields, along withmolecular techniques such as PCR augmenting culture results (Aggarwal et al . 2013; al . 2018; Silva et al . 2021). Perhaps it is time to request these techniques from the processing laboratories when submitting samples on cases where a synovial infection is suspected. Bacteriological culture techniques are biased towards fast-growing, aerobic or aerotolerant organisms, where requirements are satis ed by an extremely limited array of growth media and biased against fastidious or strictanaerobe bacteria (Zhao-Fleming et al . 2019). By extension, our body of literature and reference databases are similarlyflawed. Fortunately, molecular diagnostic techniques are challenging these historic shortfalls. A recent study in horsesdemonstrated that a combination of PCR ampli cation of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes (16S rRNA) and lineblotting from DNA extracted from synovial fluid samples was superior to culture in detecting synovial infections (Pille et al . 2007). The extension of this technology is next-generation sequencing (NGS). NGS has been used to identify bacteria at the family level using 16S rRNA sequencing. The power of this technology was again demonstrated in a study comparing conventional aerobic and anaerobic culture techniques to 16S rRNA NGS in samples from necrotising soft tissue infections in humans (Zhao-Fleming et al . 2019). Results demonstrated a greater than 70% contribution of obligateanaerobes to the bacterial populations identi ed in samples. Could undiscovered obligate anaerobes have played acontributory role in the demise of Case 6 in Kalka et al . (2022)? Going one step further, metagenomic NGS (mNGS) isthe ability to sequence nucleic acids present in a sample and identify speci c bacteria, fungi, archaea and viruses through mapping to reference databases. Antibioticresistance genes can also be identi ed in this way; however, the ability to match up the antibiotic resistance genecassette with the speci c organism typically still requires culture. Applying mNGS data to help isolate species is a work in progress (Fang et al . 2021). Whilst these technologiesare still in their infancy as a clinical tool, they are showing their mettle in both research and academic clinical settings (Liet al . 2021). These technologies may seem like a distant beat, but the rapidity with which technology is moving couldmean they will be part of our diagnostic toolkit in short order. Before that happens, however, a concerted effort needs to be made to understand what is background noise and what is not. We have known for some time that bacterial DNA can still be found in clinically normal joints after the resolution of septic arthritis (van der Heijden et al . 1999). There is a great body of work on synovial joints and the physiology ofeach joint may not be directly comparable, as has been noted in the case of corticosteroid injection (Soma et al. 2005). As such, there may also be aspects of directlycomparing synovial structures that we as yet do not understand. We need to know what variety and level of microorganism background constitute normal, and what is colonisation vs. infection. Indeed, samples can be submitted to many laboratories for mNGS right now, but the informatic pipeline and know-how to tease through the 'big data ' analyses to derive clinically relevant information remain aHerculean task that will involve all of us in a collaborative and concerted effort to ultimately 'raise our game '.

Ireland Institute of Infection, Veterinary & Ecological Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, The University of Liverpool, commonly recognised condition in rst-opinion equine practice, yet there is little published information regarding its diagnosis, treatment and management. Objectives To describe current approaches of veterinary surgeons working in the United Kingdom (UK) to the diagnosis, treatment and management of distal limb cellulitis in horses. Study design Cross-sectional survey. Methods An online questionnaire was distributed via email and socialmedia sites for a period of 12 weeks. Descriptive statistics were produced, and chi-square or Fisher 's exact tests were used to assess associations between categorical variables,with critical probability set at 0.05. Results Distal limb cellulitis is frequently encountered in the UK, with83.5% (n =224/268) of respondents having treated >5 cases in the preceding 12 months. Diagnosis was predominantlymade based on clinical signs alone (89.2%; n =239/268). The majority of respondents (95.5%; n =256/268) most frequently prescribed, and 61.7% (n =148/240) of respondents prescribed these drugs in combination. Duration of treatment was most frequently ve days for NSAIDs (33.5%; prescribed duration of any treatmentsbeing 10 days. Corticosteroids were administered by 41.0% of respondents (n =110/268). Management recommendations included cold hosing/ice packing of the affected limb (79.4%;n=212/267) with light exercise (turnout or hand walking) if the horse was comfortable enough to do so (97.4%; n =260/267). Main limitations Small sample size (n =268) and low level of item omission for a small number of questions. Conclusions Cellulitis is common in the UK and is usually treated withNSAIDs and antimicrobials for 5 -10 days, plus cold hosing and light exercise. Further study on the topics of diagnosis andtreatment, with particular emphasis on the aetiology and necessity of antimicrobials, is warranted. Clinical relevance \u0081This is the rst study to describe current practice by UK veterinary surgeons with respect to their methods fordiagnosing, treating and managing distal limb cellulitis in horses. \u0081Results demonstrate that distal limb cellulitis is acommon presentation and that the majority of veterinary surgeons are employing similar treatment modalities. \u0081This study highlights the limited evidence availableto inform management of equine cellulitis and the need for further research in order to better inform clinical practice and appropriate antimicrobial stewardship. 10.1111/eve.13484_1Original Article An investigation of behaviour during tacking-up and mounting in ridden sports and leisure horses S.

Objectives To describe equine behaviour during tacking-up andmounting. Study design Cross-sectional, prospective observational study, using aconvenience sample. Methods A purpose-designed protocol for documenting behaviour during tacking-up and mounting was developed. Horses were recruited from 11 locations, from both amateur and professional riders. Horses (n =193) were observed during acquisition of prede ned information from the owners. Behaviour data were recorded during bridling, placement of the saddle, girthing and mounting. Results The majority (67%) were bridled rst. The median sum of abnormal behaviours tacking-up was 10/64 (interquartile range [IQR] 7.13; range 0.33). There was an equal frequency of abnormal behaviours during bridling and saddling in 52% of horses; 34% behaviours saddling bridling; 15% ofhorses showed more abnormal during bridling than saddling. The duration of abnormal behaviours related to total tacking-up time was 25 -75% in 51% of horses. There was a positive relationship between the sum of abnormalbehaviours and the duration of abnormal behaviours (P=0.0001). Repeatedly chomping on the bit occurred most frequently during bridling (67%). Ears back (57 -65%) and anintense stare (54 -62%) were similar in all phases. Fidgeting was more common during saddle placement (32%) and girthing (21%), than bridling (9%). Tail swishing placement (20%) and girthing (34%), than bridling (10%). Turning the head to the girth was only seen during saddle placement and girthing (11 and 40%, respectively), in addition to attempting to bite (5 and 15%, respectively) and rubbing the nose (8 and 21%, respectively). The median sum of abnormal behaviours during mounting was 1/30 (IQR 1.3; range 0.12). Main limitations Absence of many nonlame horses with correctly tting tack. Conclusion Abnormal behaviour during tacking-up and mounting wascommon. Clinical relevance \u0081Many of the behaviours observed were typical ofthose previously attributed to stereotypical behaviour (e.g. head tossing, tongue out, nose rubbing, licking),which is frequently stress-associated. Some behaviours may be a re flection of pain (e.g. ears back, intense stare, tail swishing). Biting and kicking have beenconsidered as aggressive behaviour. \u0081Such behaviours may be exhibited in anticipation ofmusculoskeletal pain during ridden exercise, which may be associated with ill- tting tack in some horses. \u0081Owners need to be made aware that thesebehaviours are not normal and may be a manifestation of underlying problems. \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd304 3 Burba Thompson HC, Holder CL: In vivo kinetic study on uptake and distribution of intramuscular tritium-labeled polysulfated glycosaminoglycan in equine body fluid compartments and articular cartilage in an osteochondral defect model.

Objectives To relate behavioural abnormalities during tacking-up or mounting to epaxial muscle hypertonicity or pain, girth region hypersensitivity, ill- tting tack, rider position and balance, or equine musculoskeletal pain. Study design Prospective observational study; convenience sample of 193 horses. Methods The behaviour of horses in a stable or tied up was observed for 8 minutes before systematic palpation of the thoracolumbosacral and girth regions. Owners were asked totack-up and mount using their normal regime. A purpose- designed protocol for assessment of behaviour during tacking-up and mounting was applied. Lameness was evaluated in-hand and during ridden exercise. Static saddle t and dynamic saddle t were assessed. A static saddle- t score was the sum of any saddle- t abnormality. Rider position in the saddle, balance and size relative to the saddle were evaluated during ridden exercise. Multivariable negative binomial regression modelling was used to assess the relationship between the sum of tacking-up and mounting behaviours and horse, rider and tack- t variables. Results Riding School horses comprised only 12% of the samplepopulation, but had higher rates of abnormal behaviours during both tacking-up (P <0.0001) and mounting (P =0.007) compared with General Purpose horses. The rate of abnormalbehaviour during tacking-up for horses with moderate orsevere lameness was 1.4 times higher (P =0.02) than for nonlame horses. Horses with lameness in-hand or ridden had1.5 times higher rates of abnormal behaviour during mounting than nonlame horses. Tight tree points (P =0.03) and epaxial muscle pain (P <0.001) were associated with higher behaviour scores during tacking-up. Higher static saddle- t scores were associated with higher behaviour scores duringmounting. Main limitations Oral examination was not performed. Conclusions The display of many behaviours during tacking-up ormounting is likely to re flect lameness or tack-associated discomfort. Owners must be better educated to recognisethese behaviours. Clinical relevance \u0081Epaxial muscle pain was also a signi cant factor associated with tacking-up behaviour, although only seen in a small number of horses. It may be secondary to lameness or altered range of motion of the thoracolumbosacral region associated with an ill- tting saddle, or a combination of factors, including riderposition, size and balance. \u0081There was no effect of girth region hypersensitivity onbehaviour during tacking-up or mounting, but this may be potentially signi cant in some horses. \u0081The high prevalence of ill- tting saddles, and their influence on behaviour and performance, highlight the need for regular saddle- t checks (at least every 6 months). \u00a92021 10.1111/eve.13440_1Original Article Application of a Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram to horses competing at 5-star three-day-events: Comparison with performance S. Dyson*and A. D. Ellis The Cottage, Market Weston, UK; Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE) was previously developed to facilitate the detection of musculoskeletal pain. The objectives were to apply the RHpE during warm-up for the dressage phase of two 5 *three-day events and to correlate the RHpE scores with subsequent performance. It washypothesised that there would be a higher rate of failure to complete the cross-country phase in horses which exhibited 7 behaviours compared with those showing <7 behaviours. The RHpE, comprising 24 behaviours, was applied for 10 - 12 min during warm-up. Gait abnormalities in trot and canter were recorded. Dressage penalties, cross-country performance, showjumping penalties and nal placings were documented. Horses were categorised as those whichcompleted cross-country, or those which did not complete because of elimination or retirement. RHpE scores (n =137) ranged from 0 to 9/24 (median 3 [range 0 -9] for nonlame horses; median 5 [range 1 -9] for horses with gait abnormalities in trot or canter). There was a moderatecorrelation between dressage penalty scores and the RHpE score (rho =0.4, P <0.001, Spearman rank). Fifty-nine per cent of horses (n =10/17) with a RHpE score 7 failed to complete cross-country, compared with 33% (n =39/117) with a score <7. Horses that failed to complete the cross-country phase had higher RHpE scores compared with those thatcompleted signi cant (rho =0.3) relationship between total RHpE score and nal horse placings (n =80, P <0.01, Spearman rank). Horses with lameness gait abnormalities in canter had signi cantly higher RHpE scores (P <0.01, v 2=35, chi-square test) compared with other horses. There was a strong correlation between the RHpE scores for horses which competed at both events (P <0.001, rho =0.6, Spearman rank). The RHpE should facilitate earlier identi cation of horses which may bene t from diagnosis and treatment, resulting in improvement in both performance and equine welfare. Introduction There has been considerable debate in recent years about what constitutes lameness (van Weeren et al . 2018; Bathe et al. Adair et al. 2018, 2019; Dyson 2019a; van Weeren 2019). It is clear that there are some horses which exhibit measurable asymmetry in gait which may not in fluence performance (Greve and Dyson 2016). There is a growingbody of evidence that approximately 50% of the sports horse population which are in regular work have subjectively assessed (Greve and Dyson 2014; Dyson and Greve 2016;Dittman et al . 2020) or objectively assessed (Rhodin et al . 2016; Wilson et al . 2016) gait abnormalities that are likely to re flect musculoskeletal pain. The failure of a systemic nonsteroidal anti-in drug (meloxicam) to in fluence measurable gait asymmetries (Persson-Sjodin et al . 2019) does not preclude the presence of underlying pain. The response to diagnostic anaesthesia is a more reliable means of determining the presence or absence of pain (Dyson 2016b). It has been observed that lameness which is not visible in hand may be detectable during ridden exercise and that subtle gait abnormalities in hand may be accentuated with a rider (Licka et al . 2004; Dyson and Greve 2016). Moreover, some horses do not show asymmetries of gait in trot but showpain-related gait abnormalities in canter (Greve and Dyson 2014; Dyson 2016a; Greve and Dyson 2020). In order to aid the recognition of horses showing pain- related body language, caused by musculoskeletal pain, a Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE) was developed in studies which compared nonlame and lame horses (Dyson et al . 2018a). The RHpE comprised 24 behaviours, the majority of which were at least 10 times more likely to be seen in ahorse with musculoskeletal pain compared with a nonlame horse. Nonlame horses demonstrated a median of 2/24 behaviours (range 0 -6), whereas lame horses exhibited a median of 9/24 behaviours (range 4 -14), although some lame horses scored <8. It was concluded that the presence of8/24 behaviours was a good indicator of musculoskeletal pain, and this was veri ed in further studies (Dyson et al . 2018b, 2020; Dyson and van Dijk, 2020). However, the RHpE cannot rule out other causes of discomfort, such asgastric ulceration. This RHpE now needs to be tested further to assess its reliability and usefulness in the eld, for example at competitions. Three-day events comprise dressage, cross-country and showjumping. Horses at F /C19ed/C19eration Equestre Internationale (FEI) Concours Complet International (CCI) events undergo a public inspection by the Ground Jury (the dressage judges) and a veterinarian, in hand at trot, 1 or 2 days prior to performing a dressage test, to determine tness to compete. Horses with overt lameness are eliminated. Prior to thedressage phase of the competition, the competitors warm-up on a grass surface, performing a variety of movements in walk, trot and canter. In the cross-country phase, a fall of horse or rider, four cumulative refusals, or three refusals at a single fence result in elimination. A rider may elect to retire a horse if it is jumping poorly. On the nal day of competition, horses undergo a second public inspection prior to theshowjumping phase, and horses with overt lameness are eliminated. aims of the study were to: (i) describe gait abnormalities in horses warming up for the dressage phase at two CCI 5 *events; (ii) apply the RHpE during the dressage warm-up phase of these two events; and (iii) correlate theRHpE scores with subsequent performance. It was hypothesised that there would be a higher rate of failure to complete the cross-country phase in horses which exhibited 7 behaviours compared with those showing <7 behaviours. Materials and methods Pilot study Pilot data were acquired at Burghley CCI 4 *(now 5 *) event in 2018 (Dyson 2019b). A convenience sample of 35 horses, competing in consecutive order on the second day of dressage, was each assessed for a minimum of 10 min during trot and canter in the late stages of warm-up. The RHpE was applied by a trained assessor (S.D., a Diplomate of theEuropean College of Veterinary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation). Cross-country performance was obtained from the competition website; horses were classi ed as completing, eliminated or retired. Twenty-seven nonlamehorses scored 0 -4/24 behaviours (mean [s.d.] range [IQR] 0,3); the most frequently observed behaviours were head behind the vertical 10 s; mouth open 10 s. Eight horses with gait abnormalities scored 3 -9/24 (median 7.5, IQR 4,8; mean 6, s.d./C62); the most frequently observed behaviours were head behind the vertical 10 s; mouth open 10 s; an intense stare 5 s; and repeated head tilt. Thirty-four horses started cross-country of which 35% were eliminated or retired. Onlyfour horses scored 8. The proportion of horses failing to complete was signi cantly higher for RHpE scores 7, compared with <7. Of 28 horses which scored <7/24 behaviours, eight (29%) were eliminated or retired. Of sixhorses which scored 7/24 behaviours, four (67%) were eliminated or retired. The pilot study highlighted that in a cohort of highly trained horses competing at 5 *level, it may be useful to use a slightly lower total RHpE score as an indicator of possible influence on performance, rather than the score of 8/24, previously identi ed as a reliable score for differentiating sports horses competing at a variety of levels, from unaf liated to elite, with and without musculoskeletal pain (Dyson et al . 2018a,b, 2020; Dyson and Van Dijk 2020). Main study This was a prospective cohort study which involved all horses(n=137) warming up for the dressage phase of a CCI 5 * event (Badminton May 2019, n =70; Burghley September 2019, n =67). Observations Each horse was observed for 10 -12 min immediately prior to the scheduled dressage test. At each venue, the warm-upfacilities were identical for all competitors. This was a grass area approximately 80 980 m within which was a 20 960 m boarded arena; the area was flat at Burghley and on an incline at Badminton. The majority of horses were observed in medium walk, working and medium trot, shoulder-in, half pass, working canter and simple flying changes. Two horsesdid not perform flying changes. Most riders were receiving guidance from professional coaches. The 24 behaviour RHpE ( Table 1 ; Dyson et al . 2018a) was applied by an observer (S.D.) extensively trained in itsapplication, from the same vantage points for all horses, so that horses could be observed from behind, in front and the side on both the left and right reins. The ethogram was applied in binary fashion (yes/no), with a potential total score of 24. In addition, the horses were assessed subjectively by the same observer for the presence of lameness, gait abnormalities in canter which are not included in the ethogram (stiff, stilted canter; canter lacking a suspension phase; close temporal and spatial placement of the hindlimbs [Dyson 2016a; Greve and Dyson 2020]), saddle slip (Greve and Dyson 2013), teeth grinding, excessive blinking and other potentially relevant observations, which were recorded in note form. Gait abnormalities were subsequently classi ed as follows: 0 -absent; 1 -occasionally observed; 2 - recurring, but inconsistent; 3 -consistent abnormality in TABLE 1: The 24 behaviour Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram (Dyson et al . 2018a), which was applied in binary fashion (a behaviour was present or absent) during observation for 10 -12 min 1.

Horses were categorised as those which completed cross-country, or those which did not complete because of elimination or retirement. Additional data concerning the reason for elimination were obtained from the British Eventing website. Horses which were withdrawn before the cross-country phase were recorded. Data analysis The results for cross-country performance are presented independently for each event because the in fluence of the cross-country course varied between competitions. However,the data for completion placings and RHpE score, as well as eld observations, were analysed combined. Data were mostly nonparametric and analysed events, independentgroups), horses) and performance factors) (JASP, 2019). The signi cance level was set at P<0.05. A preliminary principal component analysis was carried out using parallelcomponent loadings with 20 of the behaviours (excluding three nonoccurring and one with low correlation). An oblique promax applied rotation method was used with parallel analysis highlighting three components in a Scree plot. This was done in order to highlight clusters of behaviours likely to occur together, rather than to reduce variables. Results Comparison between Badminton and Burghley 2019 Horse starts and status by the end of the cross-country phase At Badminton 2019, 70 horses started, two withdrew after the dressage phase and 16/68 cross-country starters (24%) failed to complete the cross-country phase. Forty-nine horses (70%) completed the event. At Burghley 2019, from 67 starters, three withdrew after dressage, and 31/64 (48%) cross-country starters failed to complete the cross-country phase. Thirty- three horses (52%) completed the event. The median RHpE score was 4 and 3, respectively, for Badminton and Burghley (Mann -Whitney, P =0.09, W=0.95). Data for completion of cross-country are summarised in Table 2 , in relation to the RHpE scores. Forty-four per cent of horses which started cross- country at Badminton with an ethogram score of 7 were retired or eliminated, compared with 20% of horses with aRHpE score of <7. At Burghley, 71% of horses which started cross-country with a RHpE score of 7 failed to complete cross-country, compared with 46% of horses with a RHpE score of <7. At Badminton eliminations comprised 1/68 unseated riders threerefusals; whereas there were 2/64 10/64 (15.6%) unseated riders and 3/64 (4.7%) accumulated refusals. Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram scores Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram scores ranged from 0 to 9 (Fig 1 ). Only 10/137 horses scored 8. The median score for horses with neither lameness nor gait abnormalities in canterwas 3 (range 0 -9), compared with a median score of 5 (range 1 -9) for horses with observed gait abnormalities. The occurrence of different behaviours was similar at each event ( Fig 2 ), with the most frequent observations being front of the head behind a vertical position >10for10 s, repeated head tilt, mouth open with separation of the teethfor10 s, an intense stare for 5sand repeated tail swishing . In total, 457 behaviours were recorded. The behaviours slow rhythm, repeated stumble or toe drag, and eye lids partially closed for 2 -5swere not observed; head in front of vertical >30for10 s and rearing were only observed once. Similar proportions of horses with gait abnormalities were seen at each event. At Badminton, 27/70 horses (38.6%) showed lameness or gait abnormalities in canter (forelimb or hindlimb lameness n =6, including three with gait in canter n =14, poor hindlimb =7). At Burghley, gait abnormalities in canter (forelimb or hindlimblameness n =12, including three with abnormal gait abnormalities in canter n =14, poor hindlimb impulsion n =2). Performance and the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram scores There was a moderate positive correlation between dressage penalty scores and the RHpE score (rho =0.4, P <0.001, Spearman rank). There was no relationship between the RHpEscore and cross-country time penalties or total showjumping penalties. There was a signi cant but weak (rho =0.3) relationship between total RHpE score and nal horse placings (n =70, P< 0.01, Spearman rank; Fig 3 ,Table 3 ). There was no difference between events for these results (Kruskal - Wallis). The median RHpE score for the ve horses withdrawn before cross-country was relatively low (median 2), although one horse had a RHpE score of 8. There was a strong trend towards a higher RHpE score for horses that did not complete (median 4) compared with those that did complete (median 3) the cross-country phase (P =0.06; W=1788, Mann - Whitney). There was a higher RHpE score for horses thatretired during the cross-country phase compared with those that completed ( Fig 4 ,P =0.04, W=8.3, Kruskal -Wallis, between eliminations and retirements ( Fig 4 ). Repeat performances In total, 25 horses participated both at Badminton and Burghley 2019. There was no signi cant difference between those attending one event or both events in nal placing, dressage penalties and showjumping penalties. Horses that attended both events tended to be placed higher at Burghley (P =0.08, t=1.8, independent t-test), partially because of a lower overall completion rate (46%). Thecompletion rate of horses attending both events was signi cantly higher at Badminton than Burghley (P <0.05, v 2=6.7, chi-square test; Table 4 ). Pairwise comparison of total RHpE scores for horses which competed at both three-day events showed that there wasno signi cant difference, with 19/25 horses having a difference in score 2 (Wilcoxon sign-test; Fig 5a ). There was a good correlation between the RHpE scores between the two events (P <0.001, rho =0.6, Spearman rank correlation; Fig 5b ). There was a mean agreement of 65% (s.d. RHpE scores 9 (n =1), 8 (n =1) and 7 (n =2) at Badminton scored 6, 5, 6 and 4, respectively, at Burghley. However, despite these reductions in RHpE scores, the horses showed major gait abnormalities in canter at both events. Comments included stiff, stilted canter; canter lacked suspension; croup high in flying changes; and bucked in flying changes. In addition, one of these horses had developed aforelimb lameness in lateral work, despite an improvement in the RHpE score, and was eliminated in the cross-country phase at Burghley. One of these horses was retired in the cross-country phase at both events, and one was eliminated in the cross-country phase at Badminton. Other observations in relation to Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram scores Horses with lameness or gait abnormalities in canter had a chi-square 6 ) with other horses. The RHpE score was signi cantly lower for horses without additional noted observations in comparison with those with a gait irregularityscore higher than 2 (P <0.001, Kruskal -Wallis; Table 5 ); there was a strong correlation between gait abnormalities and theRHpE score (rho =0.44, P<0.001, Spearman). There was a weak negative correlation between the gait score and thenal placing (the lower the score, the higher placing; rho=0.3, P<.05, Spearman). There was a stronger positive correlation between the gait score and dressage penalties (rho =0.4, P< 0.001, Spearman).Preliminary principal component analysis of the RHpE behaviours exhibited by all horses combined highlighted three distinct groupings of behaviours which were likely to occur together ( Fig 7 ). Other observations included teeth grinding (n =4; 2% of horses without gait abnormalities, 6% of horses with gait abnormalities), teeth chomping (n =2) and continuous 'tension '(n=2). Tension was shown by one horse with no detectable gait abnormality, but a RHpE score of 9. Discussion This study aimed to compare and relate the RHpE score toperformance parameters in an applied eld study. It was not within the scope of this to establish causes for any observed relationships. The RHpE was initially developed by the comparison of nonlame and lame horses (Dyson et al. 2017, 2018a) and was tested by the comparison of horses beforeand after resolution of lameness by diagnostic anaesthesia (Dyson et al . 2018b; Dyson and Van Dijk 2020). In these studies, a RHpE score of 8 was a strong indicator of the presence of musculoskeletal pain. In the current study, the application of the RHpE was explored in relatively t and healthy high-level performance horses, to test whether theethogram may be useful in predicting some aspects of performance. As would be expected from this sample population, and based on the pilot data, only a small proportion of horses showed evidence of discomfort when ridden, and therefore, a cut-off score of seven behaviours was selected for assessment. There are a number of factors with the potential to in fluence the RHpE score, including the influence of the rider and their application of the aids, as discussed below with respect to mouth opening. However, previous studies comparing the RHpE scores of lame horses before and after relief of musculoskeletal pain by diagnostic anaesthesia indicate that discomfort is of major importance (Dyson et al. 2018b; Dyson and Van Dijk 2020). When ridden horses exhibit con flict behaviour (G /C19orecka-Bruzda et al . 2015) or behaviour related to stress (Hall et al . 2014), we need to try to understand why. In accordance with our hypothesis, the proportion of horses failing to complete the cross-country phase was higherfor horses with a RHpE score 7 (mean 59%) compared with horses with a score <7 (mean 33%). The reason for failure to complete the cross-country phase could not be investigated. In addition to musculoskeletal discomfort compromising performance, other factors have to be considered, such as rider or horse error, rider skill, lack of athletic ability required toTABLE 2: Descriptive overview of data in relation to all entry starts and Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram score (RHpES) (Dyson et al. 2018a) by the end of the cross-country phase at two 5 *three-day events Venue StartsRHpES median (range) afterdressageDNC * which 4 (44%) E or (71%) E or R *Did not complete: DNC =withdrawn (W) after dressage, E, eliminated during cross-country, R, retired during cross-country 25 2015Counts10 50 01234 RHpE score56789 Fig 1: Frequencies of Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE) scores (from Dyson et al. 2018a) for horses assessed for 10 -12 min during warm-up prior to their dressage test at Badminton (n =70) and Burghley (n =67) 2019. Counts =number of horses 2022 compete at 5 *level, the footing, or loss of a shoe(s), but it is notable that two horses assessed at each event with RHpE scores 7 failed to complete on both occasions. During thecross-country a high level of adrenaline and release ofendorphins (Ferlazzo et al . 2012; Micalos 2014) may overcome musculoskeletal pain, enabling horses to jump well despite thepresence of discomfort. In the pilot study, one horse had a RHpE score of 9, ground its teeth incessantly and had a stiff, stilted hindlimb gait, and nished 7th; in the main study, one horse scored 8, lacked a suspension phase in the canter onthe left and right reins and bucked in flying changes, and nished 8th. Some horses are supremely talented and are competing well within their athletic capabilities; others are maximally stretched and if jumping errors are repeated may be less willing to keep trying, especially if there is underlying discomfort (G /C19orecka-Bruzda et al . 2013, 2015). In addition, it has previously been documented that behavioural signs ofdiscomfort may be related to ill- tting tack (Peham et al. 2004). Despite the higher elimination or retirement rateat Burghley 2019, because of the dif culty of the course, compared with Burghley 2018 and Badminton 2019 (Phillips2019), the proportion of horses failing to complete cross- country remained higher for those with RHpE scores 7 (71%) compared with the proportion with a score <7 (46%). There was also a negative relationship between the RHpE score and both the performance in the dressage phase andthe nal placing.

The FEI Rules for Dressage (2019) use terms such as 'rhythm, harmony and lightness '. The rules speci cally indicate that 'behind the bit'(the front of the head being behind a vertical position), putting the tongue out and 'agitation of the tail 'are signs of lack of submission. The term 'accepting the bridle with a light and consistent soft submissive contact 'is also used by the FEI, which is interpreted as the mouth being closed. Within the RHpE, the front of the head being behind the vertical >10\u00b0for 10 s, the mouth being open exposing the teeth for 10 s, the tongue being out and the tail swishing were previously correlated with an increased risk of musculoskeletal pain(Dyson et al . 2018a,b; Dyson et al . 2020; Dyson and Van Dijk 2020). It is notable that the front of the head being behind a vertical position >10\u00b0for10 s and the mouth being open with separation of the teeth for 10 s, were common features, observed in 64% and 45% of horses, respectively. Thesefeatures were observed in both nonlame horses with no abnormalities of canter and horses with gait abnormalities. Some riders are able to alter a horse 's head and neck position and may ride the horse with the front of the headvertical during the test, while warming up with the front of the head behind a vertical position (Hall et al . 2014; Toft et al . 2020). A study that evaluated horses performing a standard exercise test on a treadmill in walk, trot and canter, with variable head and neck positions, showed that with the front of the head in a vertical position, there was evidence of stress, manifest by increased heart rate variability and cortisol concentrations, and more con flict behaviour, compared with other head and neck positions (Smiet et al . 2014). Mouth opening may represent an evasion or con flict behaviour (G/C19orecka-Bruzda et al. 2015), or re flect discomfort associated with head position (Eisersi \u20acoet al . 2013), or the bit or bridle (Cook and Mills 2009). The principal component analysisgrouped this behaviour with most other head behaviours indicating discomfort, and also together with repeated tail swishing. Mouth opening was previously shown to be related to the presence of a rider (Dyson et al . 2017), and an increase in rein tension (Manfredi et al . 2009). Increase in rein tension has been measured as a proxy for forces applied inthe mouth. However, rein tension can be related to the horse, rider or equipment and current methods of reportingTABLE 3: Final placings of horses that completed at Badminton 2019 (n =70) and Burghley 2019 (n =67) related to the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram score (Dyson et al. 2018a), recorded during warm-up for dressage PlacingRidden Horse Pain Ethogram score 012345678 9 n 5 1 88 1 51 21 14 4 12 Mean place 19.8 16.2 25.4 30.3 27.4 23.3 42.7 36.0 8.0 30.0 SD 19.5 10.7 18.4 18.5 17.4 14.2 12.6 21.5 15.6 Minimum 4 1 5 2233 0 1 0 8 1 9 Maximum 50 38 53 84 54 48 55 56 8 41 n, number; s.d., standard deviation. 10 8 6 4 2 0 Cont.RHpE score Eliminated Retired Withdrawn Fig 4: Distribution and median Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE) scores (Dyson et al. 2018a) in relation to the outcome of the cross-country phase (Cont. -continued to showjumping; Eliminated -during cross-country; -before cross-country).

In a small study (n=7) of upper-level, Warmblood dressage horses, ridden in sitting trot on a treadmill, with a snaf fle bridle and with an appropriately tted noseband, the mouth was open with separation of the teeth for a longer period of the recorded time (23% /C613) when horses were ridden 'on the bit ', compared with loose reins (1% /C62) (Eisersi \u20acoet al . 2013). It would be interesting to compare application of the RHpE during warm-up for cross-country, when head and neck positions may be different. There was a strong relationship between the presence of gait abnormalities and the RHpE score in both the pilot study (Dyson 2019b) and the main study. Lameness, when observed, was generally low-grade ( 2/8, Dyson 2011) and often only seen in speci c movements, for example, 10-m- diameter circles, shoulder-in and half pass. There was a higher frequency of occurrence of abnormalities of canter (25%) compared with lameness (13%). Flying changes are included in the dressage test and were frequently practised during the warm-up period. In horses with gait abnormalities in canter, performance of flying changes often provoked more behaviours included in the RHpE. Not surprisingly, therewas a strong negative correlation between gait abnormalities and the dressage performance (P <0.001). Overall gait abnormalities were observed in 40% of horses, less than in thegeneral sports horse population (reported as ranging from 47% to 65% [Greve and Dyson 2014; Dyson and Greve al . 2016; Wilson et al . 2016]), as one might expect at high-level competitions. We acknowledge that it is likely that a proportion of horses would have previously undergone symptomatic treatment, for example, physiotherapy. This may have been without addressing the primary problem, for example, the cause of gait abnormalities in canter. This was a rst 'look and see 'study to determine whether RHpE scores can tell us something about the performance in a eld setting. Given the relationship between RHpE scores, gait abnormalities andperformance, it seems reasonable to assume that if the primary problems causing gait abnormalities are diagnosed and treated, then performance, and possibly RHpE score, may be improved.

The principle of marginal gains in other sports is well-recognised (Hall et al . 2012; Ingham et al . 2013; Robertson et al . 2020); for example, a minor alteration in technique may make a substantial improvement in relative performance. Resolution of low-grade pain would also enhance equine welfare. Application of the RHpE should facilitate the recognition of horses which may bene t most from further investigation and appropriate treatment. There was good consistency of the RHpE score for individual horses assessed at more than one event. Of thehorses in which there was a difference of three or more behaviours at Badminton 2019 vs. Burghley 2019 (n =6), all but one improved at Burghley. The exception was a horsewith RHpE score of 3 at Badminton, which showed left forelimb lameness and completed the event in the third quartile. At the later event, Burghley, the horse had an ethogram score of 7, again showed left forelimb lameness and underwent compulsory reinspection after the dressage phase; it was allowed to continue, but then retired during the cross-country phase. This highlights that the rst horse inspection (the 'Trot up '), and any subsequent in-hand inspection, may miss some lame horses, or those with canter abnormalities which are only apparent when ridden. We have previously observed that different horses display different behaviours as a manifestation of the presence of musculoskeletal pain (Dyson et al . 2018a,b; Dyson 2019a,b Dyson and Van Dijk 2020) and this was veri ed in the current study using principal component analysis. We have notpreviously identi ed particular behaviours of the RHpE associated with speci c sources of pain. The PCA carried out in this study was for observational purposes and seems to suggest that certain RHpE parameters cluster together. Future controlled studies could be performed to test whether there is a link to speci c causes of musculoskeletal pain or whether it reflects individual responses to discomfort.This eld study had some limitations. There is no set pattern of warm-up, so not all horses performed all movements thatthey would in the test; for example, a minority of horses did not perform flying changes. This may have in fluenced the ethogram score; for example, one horse, which ground itsteeth incessantly during the warm-up, did not perform flying changes; the RHpE score was only 2. In the test, the horseperformed flying changes badly and repeatedly became disunited and displayed other behaviours, which would haveresulted in a higher RHpE score, if seen during the warm-up. The RHpE assessor could not be blinded to lameness status. The same person applied the RHpE and assessed the gait, which could provide unconscious bias. Evaluation of the gait was of necessity subjective; however, similar observations were made in those horses evaluated at more than one event. The same assessor evaluated the horses at all events and blinding of the horses was not possible, although each horse was identi ed by number. Future studies should ideally include additional observers. When a large number of horsesunderwent sequential assessment, extreme focus on the live events was required, although it is acknowledged that repeated observations of the same horses could be influenced by recall bias. Although the data were obtained at 5 *three-day events, the rider skill level and experience were variable, which may in fluence overall performance. Ground conditions and atmosphere were similar, but weatherconditions varied. Data were only acquired from threeevents; we had originally intended to collect data at events in 2020, but this was prevented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, the consistency of the observations from three events highlights the potential usefulness of the application of the RHpE as a tool to identify horses which may bene t from management changes. We have described a relationshipbetween the RHpE scores and performance, but causality cannot be proven.

It is concluded that horses can pass an in-hand inspection, but show gait abnormalities when ridden, highlighted by behavioural changes. Gait abnormalities may compromise dressage and cross-country performance in some horses and in fluence the nal placing. The RHpE could facilitate identi cation of horses which may bene t from veterinary investigation and treatment, potentially resulting in improvement in both performance and equine welfare.

Bonilla* Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Universit found in up to 20% of horses with paranasal sinus disease but remains dif cult to diagnose and can result in persistent unilateral dischargebefore presentation. Our aim in this experimental ex vivo studywas to describe two extra-nasal approaches to access the nasal conchal bullae. Six cadaveric heads were used to determine the ideal landmarks to access the dorsal and ventral conchal bullae through two rhinocenteses performed with the aid of a 14G needle and a mallet through the maxillary bone, and to access both bullae simultaneously through a 13- mm diameter trephination. Both techniques were performed bilaterally. To assess correct placement of the rhinocenteses and trephination, each bulla was injected with a coloured insulating foam before performing a maxillary bone flap to inspect the bullae. Both bullae were successfully entered withthe 14G needle in all instances. The nasolacrimal duct was damaged while entering the ventral conchal bulla in 3/12 approaches. Trephination of allowed access to both nasal conchal bullae in all cases but one, where the portal was placed too dorsally and did not allow access to the ventral conchal bulla. The opening created with the trephine could allow the use of a small instrument such as a rongeur which could have diagnostic and therapeutic bene ts. The limitations are that this was an ex vivo study andnasolacrimal duct damage could have clinical repercussions if the duct becomes obstructed after accessing the ventral conchal bulla. It was concluded that the techniques described are simple, minimally invasive and provide access to the conchal bullae for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Additionally, they may reduce the need for CT or laser for the diagnosis and treatment of bulla empyema. Introduction Sino-nasal diseases are the most common source of unilateralnasal discharge in horses (Tremaine and Dixon 2001). A variety of well-known pathologies can be responsible for nasal discharge but recently, a new entity called nasal conchal bulla empyema (NCBE) has been reported in horses and associated with persistent unilateral nasal discharge (Dixon et al . 2015). In that report, 20% of the horses presented with sinusitis had concurrent NCBE. In the horse, each nasal bulla (DNCB) measures around 75 mm long and is found rostral to the dorsal conchal sinus while the bulla (VNCB) a mean length is located rostral to the ventral conchal sinus (Liutiet al . 2016). Each bulla drains into the middle meatus, but they do not communicate directly with the surroundingsinuses, which is why sinus lavage is not ef cient treat (CT) can be used to diagnose NCBE. In the small case series reported by Dixon et al . (2015), radiography detected bulla abnormalities but did not yield a de nitive diagnosis in the 3/ 10 horses where it was performed. However, 7/8 horses had endoscopic abnormalities suggestive of NCBE, and CT obtained a de nitive diagnosis in 10/10 horses (Dixon et al . 2015). Thereby, the diagnosis of NCBE may not be necessarily straightforward in the acute phase of the process. The presence of inspissated pus and stulation in the cases reported by Dixon could be a re flection of chronicity (Dixon et al . 2015). Lavage and removal of inspissated pus are the key components for NCBE treatment. Thus, transendoscopic diode laser is used to allow surgical access to the NCB and facilitate pus removal when they are not already stulated to the nasal passages (Dixon et al . 2015). Nonetheless, this technique can be associated with several limitations (i.e. bleeding, equipment cost, etc). Thereby, the development of an alternative approach to access the DNCB and the VNCB could facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of NCBE. The aim of our study was to describe two techniques to access the NCB extra-nasally in cadaveric specimens. We hypothesised that both techniques would allow access to the bullae and could be performed without detrimental complications. Materials and methods Firstly, a pilot study on three cadaveric specimens donated to research was performed to determine the landmarks to safely access the DNCB and the VNCB extra-nasally. Naso-maxillary flaps were performed bilaterally to expose both bullae and determine their exact locations using the infra-orbital foramenas a reference point. Distance between the bullae and the nasolacrimal duct and the infra-orbital foramen were measured. It was noted that the nasolacrimal duct runs close to the mid-to-dorsal aspect of the VNCB. Then, our study was performed on six cadaveric heads from adult horses euthanised for reasons unrelated to sino- nasal disorders (client-owned horses donated to research after euthanasia). For each head, the procedure was performed bilaterally. \u00a92020 EVJ invasive rhinocenteses The skin over the following described landmarks was clipped and then incised transversely over 3-mm after levator This also allowed avoidance of the dorsal nasal artery and vein which course along these muscles at that level. Then, a 14-gauge, 3.8-cm long needle was advanced through the nasal bone with the aid of a mallet at the landmarks described below ( Fig 1 ). To guide needle placement for both approaches, a line that crossed thedorsal surface of the nasal bone in a right angle was drawn from the infra-orbital foramen: \u0081For the DNCB, the needle is inserted half-way theinfra-orbital foramen and the dorsal aspect of the nasal bone, with the needle oriented perpendicular to the bone surface. \u0081For the VNCB, the needle is inserted at a point located at30% of the distance between the infra-orbital foramen and the dorsal aspect of the nasal bone, with a minimum of 1.5 cm above the infra-orbital foramen and the needle oriented approximately 40 \u00b0downwards. The needle was placed at least 1.5 cm above the infra-orbital foramen tominimise nasolacrimal duct damage. To assess correct placement of the needles in the corresponding bullae, the DNCB was injected with 3 -4m Lo f yellow insulating foam 1and the VNCB with 3 -4 mL of the same insulating foam mixed with methylene blue. Injectionwas performed after replacing the original needle which contained a bone plug obliterating the lumen with a new 14 G needle. Maxillary bone trephination A 2-cm additional transverse skin incision was performed between the rst two incisions, at 40% of the distance between the infra-orbital foramen and the dorsal aspect ofthe The maxillary bone was trephined with a 13-mm diameter drill perpendicular to the maxillary bone. Visual identi cation of the outer margin of both bullae was evaluated after trephination. Lastly, a large naso-maxillary bone flap was performed rostral and caudal to the NCB to expose the bullae andexpose any damage of the nasolacrimal duct along its course in the maxillary bone. Both bullae were incised on their lateral aspect with a scalpel blade to evaluate correct placement of the foam. The nasolacrimal duct was identi ed in the bone flap and its integrity was assessed. Careful dissection also allowed assessment of the infra-orbital canal and infra-orbital nerve. Results The study included three Quarter Horses, two Appendix (Quarter Horse 9Thoroughbred) and one Canadian Warmblood (3 mares and 3 geldings), that were 7 - 20 years old (mean of 13.5 years). Identi cation of the yellow and blue-yellow foam within the DNCB and the VNCB, respectively, was successful in all cases (24 structures) ( Fig2A,B ). However, the nasolacrimal duct was disrupted while entering the VNCB in 3 out of 12approaches. In one of these approaches, the needle slipped and was accidentally placed slightly lower (5-mm) than originally intended. Trephination of the maxillary bone yielded access to both NCB in all but one approach (11/12) ( Fig 3 ). In this approach, the portal was placed slightly too dorsally and did not allowaccess to the VNCB. Neither the nasolacrimal duct nor the infra-orbital canal/nerve were damaged during trephination. The trephination created was large enough to accommodate the passage of a small instrument such as haemostatic forceps or a rongeur to disrupt the walls of the bullae, if required. Discussion To our knowledge, NCBE was only recently described and seems to be a disorder that has been historically underdiagnosed (Dixon et al . 2015). This could potentially be attributed to a lack of thorough evaluation of all NCB duringtraditional upper airway diagnostic techniques (endoscopy and radiography). However, upper airway endoscopy can often yield a diagnosis when a stula or a deformation of the NCB into the nasal cavity is present. In one study, a stula was seen in 5 out of 8 cases and this was associated with the chronicity of the disease (Dixon et al . 2015). Another study has recently described the normal radiographic appearanceof the NCB in 10 equids. The DNCB was successfully identi ed on latero-lateral radiographs all cases, but identi cation of the ventral bulla was challenging. The rostral border was correctly identi ed in eight cases and the caudal border only in four (Giavitto and Barakzai 2017). Nonetheless, radiographyis reportedly of limited diagnostic value in clinical cases which may be due to previous lack of knowledge or to superimposition of the bullae with other structures (Dixon et al . 2015). Computed tomography is therefore the gold standard to diagnose NCBE and led to a de nitive diagnosis in 10/10 horses (Dixon et al . 2015). We are aware of some clinicians that use CT as guidance to determine the idealtrephination point to access and treat the affected bulla, 50% 30% Fig 1: Image depicting needle placement to access the VNCB (ventral needle) and the DNCB (dorsal needle). The white starindicates the infra-orbital foramen. The red line represents thedorsal surface of the nasal bone. The blue line highlights thedistance (percentage) between the infra-orbital foramen and thedorsal surface of the nasal bone for each needle placement. Theblack arrowhead indicates 2022 similar to the technique described here. Unfortunately, CT still requires general anaesthesia in many institutions, especially in North America, and represents a higher cost for clients. Thereby, our described minimally invasive extra-nasal approach to the NCB could be of diagnostic and therapeutic value to practices or cases where CT is not available or affordable. The rhinocenteses reported here was quickly performed and did not require specialised equipment. This technique can be used as a diagnostic tool as it allows pus aspiration from within the bulla, which could be submitted for cytological analysis and bacteriological culture. However, this could be dif cult in cases with inspissated pus. To overcome this problem, a small volume of fluid could be injected into the NCB to break off the solidi ed pus and then obtain a sample. Additionally, needle aspiration could be indicated in clinical cases where a suspicious deformation of the NCB isidenti ed during nasal endoscopy but stulation in the nasal cavity is neither present nor visible. Furthermore, it could be used as a minimally invasive option to lavage the affectedbulla in infected cases with or without inspissated pus that already present stulation to the nasal cavity. If bulla stulation is not present and bulla lavage is unrewarding, a stula could potentially be created by further advancing the needle and perforating the medial wall of the bulla. However, this technique was not investigated, and further research is required to determine its reliability. The main limitations of the rhinocenteses were that access to the VNCB with the 14G needle carried the risk of damaging the nasolacrimal duct. Theoretically, the nasolacrimal canal runs along a line from the medial canthus to the naso-incisive notch and therefore, our landmarks were located above this line (Latimer et al . 1984). The nasolacrimal damage found in 3/12 approaches might suggest individual variation of nasolacrimalduct location or simply that the reported landmarks are valid only at the level of the paranasal sinuses, but to our knowledge this has not been reported. Two sequelae are possible after damaging the duct at this level. Firstly, the duct may be iatrogenically stulated to the nasal cavity at the point of damage, which should not cause clinical signs.Secondly, the duct may get obliterated after damage, causing obstruction of the duct and permanent epiphora with an effect on cosmesis. Permanent epiphora can be corrected by canaliculorhinostomy or canaliculosinostomy. A recent technique of canaliculosinostomy to the caudal maxillary sinus without requiring an osteotomy and using a Foley catheter left in place for 3 weeks showed good results (Robinson et al . 2016). The small diameter trephination described here allowed satisfactory access to both bullae and can be used for diagnostics, although its main potential is for therapeutic purposes after a positive diagnosis is obtained via imaging or needle aspiration. This portal could probably allow samplingof the contents of the bulla via a needle or after opening the lateral wall of the bulla with haemostatic forceps or a small rongeur. The latter technique could also be used in clinical cases to remove inspissated pus and perform bulla lavage under pressure.

In our study, the trephination wasperformed with a power drill to simplify and accelerate the procedure. This could be replaced by a manual drill, a Jacobs chuck and a Steinmann pin or a small Galt trephine on live horses. Information regarding the treatment of NCBE is limited and usually consists in NCB lavage and inspissated pus removal under endoscopic guidance. If a stula is not already present fenestration using transendoscopic diodelaser tends to be the recommended choice (Dixon et al. 2015). This technique offers direct visualisation and is relatively easy to perform but has several inconveniences. Firstly, the high risk of haemorrhage in this area may impair visibility during the procedure and either lengthen it or make it impossible to perform in one stage. The reported technique will neither be exempt of haemorrhage, but we do not anticipate the need of performing simultaneous endoscopy during the procedure. Secondly, the laser can cause NCB bone necrosis, potentially leading to bone sequestrum formation (Dixon et al . 2015). Lastly, it requires specialised equipment. Thereby, the technique here proposed maysimplify the treatment of NCBE by allowing direct access to the affected region without requiring laser equipment. The main limitation of our study is the absence of clinical cases. Considering that the technique used to perform therhinocentesis is similar to a mini-sinusotomy technique recently reported to evaluate the sinuses, we anticipate that it should also be easily performed and tolerated on live horses (Pouyet and Garcia Bonilla 2019). In addition, trephination of the maxillary bone to access the sinuses or the NCB is already performed at our institution and others in clinical cases without major repercussions. During trephination, care should be taken to avoid the branches of the dorsal nasal artery and vein. Also, mild subcutaneous emphysema and cellulitis are potential complications on live animals. The specimen used in this study were from mature middle-sized horses of various breeds. Similarly to the paranasal sinuses, the size of the NCB is proportional to the size of the head and is signi cantly smaller in horses younger than 5 years old, partially due to theprotrusion of the maxillary cheek teeth roots into the nasal passages (Liuti et al . 2016). Thus, the reported landmarks were not validated for small or large-sized breeds or young horsesand, although their extrapolation to horses of other sizes and ages is possible, it remains to be investigated. Lastly, cheek teeth damage is possible in young animals with the reported technique. However, this risk could potentially be prevented by radiographic mapping of the teeth roots with radiography (Giavitto and Barakzai 2017). This study described two novel extra-nasal approaches to access the DNCB and the VNCB in horses. The techniques employed were minimally invasive, simple and did not require any specialised instruments. Damage to the nasolacrimalduct is possible while accessing the VNCB with rhinocentesis.The reported techniques offer new treatment options for NCBE in horses and have also the potential to be of diagnostic value.

Senior School of Veterinary and Life Sciences, Murdoch University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia; andDepartment of Equine Clinical Science, Institute of Veterinary Science, University of Liverpool, Neston, Cheshire, is routinely used in equine anaesthesia, with many different options available to mechanically deliver breaths. The complexity of respiratory pathophysiology in anaesthetised horses and the wide rangeof devices available is described in this scoping review. The rst part of the review outlines basic equine respiratory physiology and pathophysiology during anaesthesia toillustrate what makes horses prone to inef cient gas exchange and ventilation when they are recumbent. Thedifference between spontaneous ventilation and CMV is reviewed and basic considerations of CMV are explored in more detail. Physiology and pathophysiology of ventilation and its matching with perfusion Movement of gas In mammals, ventilation involves the movement of gas in and out of the lungs. This gas movement allows the uptake of oxygen (O 2) from the inspired gas to the blood, and the elimination of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Ventilation is controlled by the respiratory centre in the medulla, assisted by peripheral and central receptors and, on some occasions, with input from the cortex (Hall 2015). During inspiration, the intercostal muscles and diaphragm contract increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity and expanding the elastic bres in the lung tissue creating a negative pressure of 1t o 2 cmH 2O within the airways (West and Luks 2016a). This sub-atmospheric pressure drives the gas down the pressure gradient through the airways into the alveoli where it undergoes gas exchange. Inhalation is an active process. In conscious horses, expiration is divided into arst passive phase, and a second active phase when abdominal muscles contract to exhale actively (Koterbaet al . 1988). Ventilation ( _V) is determined by the minute ventilation which equals respiratory rate (RR) multiplied by tidal volume(V T)-the volume of gas moved per breath -and therefore minute ventilation can be increased or decreased bychanging RR or V T. _V\u00bcRR/C2VT Horses adapt their minute ventilation according to their metabolic requirements which directly in fluence the central respiratory control centres to meet O 2requirement and consumption, CO 2production and to keep blood pH stable.Under normal conditions, the arterial partial pressure of CO 2 (PaCO 2) will be the main driver of ventilation, whereas the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (P aO2) will only take over in cases of hypoxaemia (hypoxic drive) (Hall 2015). However, insome situations, for example during strenuous exercise, adrop in P aO2(<80 mmHg), and acidaemia (pH <6.9) may occur despite marked increases in ventilation, while P aCO 2is maintained close to resting level (40 45 mmHg) (Hodgson et al . 1990). During general anaesthesia, O 2consumption and CO 2production is close to resting levels (Hall 1971). Therefore resting _Vis suf cient to maintain adequate gas exchange during anaesthesia. Dead space The mammalian respiratory tract is not 'well designed 'for efciency in gas exchange compared with the work of breathing required for gas exchange. A proportion of theinhaled gas never takes part in gas exchange as it does not reach the alveolar level and is therefore 'wasted 'ventilation. This volume represents dead space. The total dead spacevolume -meaning all the gas that is inhaled but does not take up any CO 2or give off any O 2-is known as physiological dead space ( VDphys ) which can also be expressed as a ratio between the dead-space volume andtidal volume ( V D/VT). Physiological dead space can then be divided into: 1 Airway dead space ( VDaw): this includes the volume in the conducting airways from lips down to the interphasewhere gas molecules are not moving by bulk flow (convection) but by diffusion (West and Luks 2016a). Thus, V Daw can change from breath to breath depending on where this interphase lies, which varies with flow and volume inhaled (Fletcher et al . 1981). 2 Alveolar dead space ( VDalv): this includes volume in alveoli that are ventilated but are nonperfused so gas exchange does not occur (West and Luks 2016a). VDalvis negligible in the awake standing horse and the spontaneouslybreathing anaesthetised patient (Mosing et al . 2018). V Dphys\u00bcVDaw\u00feVDalv In the standing horse, VD/VTis around 0.4 0.5 (Gallivan et al . 1989) which means that if a horse has a VTof 5, 2.5 L do not undergo gas exchange and is 'wasted '. In contrast, VD/VTunder anaesthesia in spontaneously breathing horses is around 0.3 0.4 (Mosing et al . 2018). be increased by apparatus dead space (also known as equipment or mechanical dead space) which is the volume of gas extending the airway dead space distal to the lips (e.g. face mask or endotracheal tube in front of the lips) (Fletcher et al . 1981). Consequently, VDaw itself can be decreased using an endotracheal tube that ends at the level of the lips and bypasses the nasal cavity. Another term used in the literature is anatomical dead space, which refers to the xed volume within anatomical structures, where no gas exchange takes place (Bohr 1891).This space can only be measured by lling these anatomical structures with fluid after removal of the gas exchanging tissue -namely the alveoli (Bohr 1891). As this is clinically not relevant, it will not be further addressed in this review. Ventilation to perfusion matching To guarantee optimal gas exchange, ventilation needs to match the perfusion within one lung unit. A lung unit, which isfunctionally related to the perfusion of the lung, refers to all the structures perfused by one speci c pulmonary artery branch whose obstruction or collapse would cause completeelimination of gas exchange in the named structures due to lack in perfusion (Hedenstierna et al . 2000). The size of a lung unit therefore varies between species. Numerous studies have looked at the matching between ventilation and perfusion in both awake and anaesthetisedhorses (Hall et al . 1968; Gillespie et al. 1969; Amis et al. al al . 1995). In standing awake horses, perfusion and ventilation are preferentially dorsocaudal(Staddon and Weaver 1981; Dobson et al . 1985; Hlastala et al. 1996). Anatomical conformation of the pulmonaryartery and its branches may favour a richer perfusion in dorsal regions, overcoming gravitational forces (Hlastala et al . 1996). Ventilation is greater in the dorsal region of the lung not only because ventilation is gravity dependent -air is less dense than blood and tissue structures -but also thediaphragm moves to a greater extent in the dorsal parts (Benson et al . 1982). Consequently, ventilation and perfusion match ( _V=_Q) is maximised in the awake horse et 1984; Nyman and ( Fig 2b,c). Ventilation to perfusion mismatching When ventilation does not match perfusion within one lungunit, it is called ( _V=_Q) mismatch. There are two extreme states of mismatch (West and Luks 2016b) ( Fig 2 ): 1 No ventilation but good perfusion: _V=_Q=0/1=0; The blood volume passing through these lung units will not take part in gas exchange and is called SHUNT volume 2 Good ventilation but no perfusion: _V=_Q=1/0=; The gas volume moving in and out these lung units will not take part in gas exchange and is called ALVEOLAR DEADSPACE volume. Beside these two extremes there are millions of lung units where a mismatch occurs ( Fig 2 ): 3 Low ventilation but good perfusion: low _V=_Qratio; The blood volume is not fully oxygenated while passing through these lung units. This deoxygenated blood volume PLUS the shunt volume is called VENOUS ADMIXTURE. 4 Good ventilation but low perfusion: high _V=_Q ratio; The gas in the alveoli cannot take up as much CO 2as normally perfused lung units and the gas contributes tothe alveolar dead space volume.

The vasoconstriction redirects the blood away from the regions of poor to zeroventilation towards those with suf cient to good ventilation (Lumb 2015). Horses are rated as a species with intermediatestrength of HPV (Elliott et al . 1991; MacEachern et al . 2004). HPV may play a role in _V=_Qmatching in horses during lung disease and anaesthesia in decreasing perfusion to regions with low _V=_Qratio and shunt and thereby reducing venous admixture ( Fig 3 ).How do horses ventilate under general anaesthesia? There are three main reasons why anaesthesia causes an impairment in gas exchange: 1I n fluence of drugs used during anaesthesia on ventilation 2 Relaxation of respiratory muscles causing a decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC) and small airway collapse 3 Positioning 1a) 0 110 0 1 V\u00b7V\u00b7Q\u00b7V\u00b7 Fig 2: Graphic illustration of a horse standing (a), in dorsal recumbency spontaneously breathing (b) and during controlled mechanical ventilation (c) showing the ventilation -perfusion matching over the lung eld. Ventilation ( _V) is illustrated in blue and perfusion (_Q) in red. Intensity of the shading (red or blue) represents regions of either increased perfusion (red) or ventilation (blue). Regions with maximal ventilation ( _V=1) and zero perfusion ( _Q=0) are de ned as alveolar dead space. with zero ventilation (_V=0) and maximal perfusion ( _Q=1) are de ned as shunt. Adjacent regions to these two extremes have either a high or a low _V=_Q ratio. Blood volume coming from regions with a low _V=_Q ratio and shunt regions is representing venous admixture.

Venous admixture is reduced by redirecting the blood away from underventilated lung regions towards better ventilated regions. Drugs Sedative agents and those used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia in fluence ventilation. Alpha-2 agonists are routinely used for sedation of horses and premedication before induction. Although their cardiovascular impact may be better known by most clinicians, alpha-2 agonists also cause respiratory depression seen as an increase in P aCO 2(Lavoie et al . 1992; Ringer et al . 2013). Although opioids are recognised as respiratory depressant in many species, opioids do not cause signi cant hypoventilation in horses (Nolan et al . 1991). Thus, their use cannot be contraindicated for this reason in equine practice. Anaesthetic protocols that use injectable drugs for maintenance have, as a general rule, less impact on thecardiovascular system compared with inhalant agents. Respiratory depression may also be smaller when using injectables, but this assumption will greatly depend on the combination used. For example, a combination of midazolam, medetomidine and ketamine resulted in only mild respiratory depression, with P aCO 2around 50 -55 mmHg (Yamashita et al . 2007). Volatile anaesthetic agents have a dose dependent effect on ventilation (Steffey 2002). Besides the inhibitoryeffect on the respiratory centre, they also affect the _V=_Q match to a greater extent than injectables, causing anincrease in venous admixture (Luna et al . 1996). This increase is due to the fact that volatile anaesthetics, halothaneforemost, inhibit the HPV re flex while ketamine, opioids have no on HPV (Lohser Ishikawa 2011;Lumb 2015). Common anaesthetic complications and haemodilution also inhibit this importantreflex (Lohser and Ishikawa 2011). On the other hand, lidocaine salbutamol, two drugs used during equineanaesthesia, potentiate HPV (Lohser and Ishikawa 2011). 2) Relaxation of respiratory muscles causing a decrease in FRC and small airway collapse Muscle relaxation is a requirement of general anaesthesia especially in equine patients. However, complete relaxation of the respiratory muscles causes a decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC) which is the volume of gas in the lungs at the end of a passive tidal expiration. In conscious patients, when respiratory muscles are relaxed, the opposing forces of thoracic wall and elastic recoil of the lung tissue are in equilibrium at FRC, a volume that keeps the bronchioles open. A reduction in FRC as seen during anaesthesia leads to collapse of bronchioles. As the alveoli distal to these collapsed airways are not ventilated anymore, the reduction in FRC leads to lung regions that are aerated but unventilated (Sorenson and Robinson 1980). This increases the number of lung units with low _V=_Q(Nyman et al . 1990). A high concentration of oxygen (F iO2) is often used during anaesthesia in the inspiratory gas mixture. This is necessary to compensate for hypoventilation generally occurring due tothe administration of the anaesthetic drugs (Mosing and Senior 2018). However, this high FiO 2leads to absorption atelectasis behind closed airways; when the small airway collapses and no fresh gas gets into the alveoli, the gas trapped in these alveoli will get absorbed into the blood stream until a diffusion balance is reached between alveolus and blood (Hedenstierna and Rothen 2000). If the gas is pureoxygen, this balance will only be reached when all gas isabsorbed and the alveolus collapses (atelectasis) (Hedenstierna and Edmark 2010). Inspiratory gas mixtures with a high fraction of oxygen (F iO2) have been shown to enhance the formation of atelectasis in anaesthetised horses(Marntell et al . 2005). 3) Positioning As soon as a horse becomes recumbent, alterations in the _V=_Qrelationship take place (Sorenson and Robinson 1980; Dobson et al . 1985). Gas exchange impairment is larger in dorsally recumbent horses when compared to lateral recumbency (Day et al . 1995). The reason why recumbency has a great impact in ventilation lies in the dome-shapeddiaphragm of the horse and the pressure exerted by abdominal viscera (Moens 2013) which forces air out of lung units causing collapse and the formation of compression atelectasis (Hedenstierna and Edmark 2010). An example of how compression of the lungs affects gas exchange ishighlighted by comparing head up with head down position in anaesthetised horses in dorsal recumbency where a 7 \u00b0 head up position signi cantly lowered venous admixture compared to head down position (Binetti et al . 2018). What is the difference between spontaneous and mechanical ventilation and why do we need CMV? During CMV, positive pressure is applied to the lungs and gas pushed into the airways to in flate the lung tissue ( Fig 1b ), which is the opposite of what drives the gas down the lungsduring spontaneous ventilation (Corona and Aumann 2011) (Fig 1a ). Work of breathing During conscious spontaneous breathing, respiratory muscles consume energy during inspiration and during the second active phase of expiration. The work required to overcome the elastic forces of the lungs and thoracic wall is called work of breathing (WOB). As aforementioned, both inspiration and second phase of expiration are active (Koterba et al . 1988). In contrast, expiration is passive in horses during anaesthesia. Resistance to flow through the nasal cavity, larynx and pharynx comprises between 50 and 70% of the totalresistance of the conductive airways (Ewart 2020). Thus, endotracheal intubation can decrease the WOB by bypassing the upper airway (Tomasic et al. 1997). However, using endotracheal tubes with too narrow internal diametersresults in an increase in resistance and, thus, WOB (Tomasic et al . 1997). The WOB is increased in cases of airway obstruction, for example equine asthma, as more elasticrespiratory work is required during inspiration and expiration (Hoffman et al . 2007). During CMV the WOB is done by the ventilator thus favouring the use of CMV in horses sufferingfrom equine 2017). Foals have an increased WOB compared to adult horses since foals 'chest wall is more compliant than adult horses ' (Koterba et al. 1994) -thus foals need to work harder to overcome elastic forces and expand the chest wall. Additionally, foals require higher _Vper kilogram of bodyweight than adult horses and have less metabolic reserves, making them prone to respiratory fatigue (Beech Ltd323 june 2022 1985). Therefore, mechanical ventilation should be considered in foals especially if long surgeries are expected. Hypoventilation Hypoventilation occurs when a reduced amount of gas isentering the alveoli (reduced alveolar minute ventilation) which results in hypercapnia and hypoxaemia. The drugs used to anaesthetise a horse will always cause a certain degree of hypoventilation (Hodgson et al . 1986; Day et al. 1995), becoming more severe with deeper levels ofanaesthesia. To overcome the development of detrimental hypoxaemia due to hypoventilation, an oxygen enriched gas mixture is used during anaesthesia (Auckburally and degree of hypoventilation inhalational anaesthesia (Luna et al . 1996; McMurphy et al . 2002). One way to increase alveolar minute ventilation is to control minute ventilation _Vby switching from spontaneous ventilation to CMV. Edner et al . (2005) maintained normocapnia (38 -45 mmHg for P aCO 2) during CMV with a minute ventilation of about 44 L/min and respiratory rate ofaround 6 breaths per minute in horses whose mean weight was 492 kg. This would give a tidal volume of 15 mL/kg. However, one must consider that only a portion of the V T will reach the alveolar level and contribute to alveolar ventilation as 30 -50% of the tidal volume is 'wasted 'in the airways in awake and anaesthetised horses (Gallivanet al . 1989; Mosing et al . 2018). When tidal volumes below 10 mL/kg are used during CMV, the amount reaching thealveolar level may be insuf cient to eliminate CO 2from the lungs even when using a high respiratory rate. Therefore, asufcient V Tis crucial to avoid hypoventilation (Bumbacher et al . 2017). Intrathoracic pressure and the effect on the cardiovascular system As demonstrated in Fig 1a , gas flows into the lungs down a pressure gradient during spontaneous ventilation. The sub- atmospheric intrapleural pressure also supports the cardiovascular system by sucking blood into the thoracic cavity and therefore towards the heart, a phenomenonwhich is known as respiratory pump (Koterba et al . 1988). When CMV is applied ( Fig 1b ), the opposite effect occurs: the positive pressure applied to the lungs is transmitted to intrathoracic structures, including the relatively thin-walled central veins, thereby reducing preload to the right atrium and, consequently, reducing cardiac output (Edner et al . 2005; Araos et al . 2020). During hypovolaemia, the effect of the mean positive thoracic pressure over time onvenous return is enhanced compared to a patient with normal intravascular volume (Noel-Morgan and Muir 2018; Araos et al . 2020). The positive pressure in the alveoli compresses the attached capillaries, which al . al . 2020). This increase in afterload to the right heart further reduces cardiac output. Many authors have previously evaluated the cardiorespiratory effects of CMV (Hodgson et al . et al . 2009), with con flicting results due to differences in study design. However, most studies show anegative impact of CMV on cardiac output with a drop ofup to 25% (Edner et al . 2005) and therefore, even when the oxygenation of arterial blood may be better, the decrease incardiac output might impact oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues (Mosing et al . 2017). A certain drop in arterial blood pressure is therefore unavoidable whenswitching from spontaneous ventilation to CMV and, hence, hypotension should always be considered as a potential complication. Factors that magnify the effect of CMV on cardiac output include (Araos et al . 2020): the magnitude and time of the pressure applied, compliance of the lungsand thorax (how effectively the pressure is transmitted from the lungs to the great vessels) and volume status with hypovolaemic horses -for example colic -being at greater risk of hypotension if CMV is applied (Noel-Morgan and Muir2018). For these reasons, arterial blood pressure monitoring is warranted whenever CMV is used. Distribution of ventilation As stated above, gas movement occurs primarily within the dorsal portion of the lung during spontaneous breathing as the contraction of the diaphragm is causing maximal movement in its dorsal parts. This directs the ventilation towards the more perfused regions of the dorso-caudal lung in the standing horse (Ambrisko et al . 2016) ( Fig 2a ) and in the et al . 2017). During CMV, the of the natural movement of the diaphragm andpassive caudal displacement of the diaphragm results in a shift of ventilation towards the nondependent part of the lungs away from the perfusion (Ambrisko al . Fig 2c ). _V=_Q mismatch The change in _V=_Qmatching after initiation of CMV has several consequences to consider: \u0081High airway pressures during CMV cause overdistension of the airways and nondependent lung units (Moens et al . 1998). The overdistension causes a collapse of the adjacent capillaries causing nonperfused but ventilatedlung units which increases 'true 'alveolar dead 1989) ( Fig 2c ). These nonperfused alveoli do not take up any CO 2from the blood causing a very low partial pressure of CO 2in the gas exhaled from these lung units and a decrease in the volume of CO 2being exhaled per breath (Tusman et al . 2012). However, it is important to note that the blood that gets redirected to well-ventilatedlung units can still take up oxygen but cannot of fload more CO 2as these well-perfused alveoli are already fully 'loaded 'with CO 2. The elimination of the CO 2from these alveoli depends on ventilation (West and Luks 2016a)(Fig 4 ). \u0081Partial collapse of alveoli in the dependent parts of thelungs which remain normally perfused will generate units with a low _V=_Q(Fig 2B,C ). The blood flowing through these lung units can give off CO 2but cannot fully oxygenate as not enough O 2is available in the reduced gas volume of the small alveolus. This leads to partially oxygenated bloodreaching the left side of the heart and systemic circulation (venous admixture) and in the worst case leading to hypoxaemia (West and Luks 2016b) ( Fig 5 ). CMV can improve oxygenation of low _V=_Qby fully in flating the partially collapsed lung units and, therefore, increasing _V=_Qratio of these lung regions (Steffey et al . 1977; Day et al . 1995). \u0081In the dependent lung, alveoli will collapse due to gravitational factors and the reduction in FRC during anaesthesia. The blood flowing through these collapsed lung units will generate shunt volume which contributes tovenous admixture. Routine ventilator settings during CMV will not be able to open up collapsed alveoli and, hence, CMV will not improve oxygenation (Hall et al . 1968; et Weaver and Walley 1975; Nyman and Hedenstierna 1988). Peak airway pressures up to 50 cmH2O are needed to 'recruit 'these alveoli 2017). This means switching from SB to CMV in lung states of large amount of atelectasis will not improve the oxygenation without special ventilatory interventions like a recruitment manoeuvre (Auckburally and Nyman 2017). Volatile anaesthetic agent uptake During spontaneous breathing, depth and rate of the breaths(and hence minute ventilation) varies causing an unpredictable uptake of the volatile anaesthetic agent (Moens 2013). CMV aims to provide a constant minute ventilation with adequate alveolar ventilation, therefore speeding up the uptake of volatile anaesthetic during the transition from induction to maintenance. However, one also must be aware that this might deepen anaesthesia when switching from spontaneous ventilation to CMV during anaesthesia (Eger 1974). Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) There are multiple mechanisms through which CMV maydamage the lung. Beitler et al . mechanisms as volutrauma, barotrauma, biotrauma andatelectrauma. Volutrauma is caused by overdistension of the alveoli, not necessarily associated with high pressures. Barotrauma is caused by high transpulmonary pressures, not necessarily associated with high volumes. Biotrauma is caused by associated in flammation that develops in the mechanically damaged alveoli. Atelectrauma is caused bystress and shear on lung units that collapse during expiration and are recruited during inspiration -known as tidal recruitment. It has been shown in human medicine that not only the mechanical stress itself but also the frequency at which this is applied plays a role in the development of VILI (Amato et al . 2015). In horses, there is only one study looking at markers of VILI during different ventilation strategies, nding that proin flammatory biomarkers were higher when recruitment manoeuvres were applied, but not signi cantly different between spontaneous ventilation and regular CMV with nopositive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (Hopster et al . 2016). However, these results should be interpreted cautiously as themost deleterious effects of CMV on the lungs in other species are observed in already diseased lungs or in long-term ventilation (Beitler et al . 2016). What should the clinician choose: spontaneous breathing or CMV? The discussion above can be condensed to state that the anaesthetist 's aims when using CMV include the following:1Control of hypoventilation : CMV allows the clinician to provide a predetermined minute ventilation. This way,ventilation can be increased to eliminate CO 2from the lungs, avoiding hypercapnia, respiratory acidosis and itsnegative effects on homeostasis. 2Faster and more predictable inhalant anaesthetic uptake : by ensuring a greater minute ventilation, more volatile anaesthetics gets into the alveoli and diffuses to the blood per unit of time. Therefore, the transition from induction with injectable anaesthetics to maintenance with volatile anaesthetics will be smoother and faster. 3Reduction of work of breathing (WOB) : during CMV the patient does not have to spend energy for respiratorymovements, which decreases oxygen consumption, which is especially important in horses that already have a high oxygen consumption (sepsis) or in horses that suffer from a) b) Fig 4: Graphical illustration on the effects of alveolar dead space on CO 2; the graph shows the heart, the blood flow out of the right side of the heart (blue) through the lungs (change in colour fromblue to red) and back to the left side of heart (red) and two lungunits represented by two circles with conducting airways. Thelevel of the CO 2partial pressure in each compartment is demonstrated by the size of the CO 2font. a) Under normal conditions, the partial pressure gradient between arterial andexpired CO 2is minimal. b) During controlled mechanical ventilation some lung units might get overdistended which causescompression and collapse of alveolar capillaries. This leaves thelung unit unperfused preventing CO 2to diffuse into the alveolar gas. The CO 2-free gas from the overdistended alveoli are mixing with the gas from well-perfused lung units containing 'normal ' CO 2and dilute the CO 2partial pressure measured at the end of expiration. This causes a large pressure gradient of CO 2between expired gases and arterial blood. The blood, however, isredirected towards well-ventilated regions where it can take upoxygen depending on the partial pressure of oxygen in thosealveoli. Therefore, an increase in alveolar dead space due to overdistension caused by controlled mechanical ventilation will not impair oxygenation, but the elimination of CO 2from WOB when awake (pleural effusion, equine asthma). 4Maintain functional residual capacity (FRC) and avoid formation of small airway collapse and atelectasis that would impair oxygenation of the blood by using PEEP. However, the disadvantages of CMV also need to be appreciated: 1Reduction in cardiac output: cardiac output will invariably decrease when CMV is used, being more pronounced in hypovolaemic patients. 2Overdistension of lung units creating alveolar dead spaceand shift in ventilation : alveolar dead space is negligible in spontaneously breathing horses, whereas some alveolimay get overstretched when using CMV, generatingregions with high _V=_Qratio. 3Ventilator-induced lung injury : important to consider in lung-diseased patients, but probably not as relevant as inother species as horses do not routinely receive long-termventilation. One important misconception should be discussed here, namely that switching from spontaneous to controlledmechanical ventilation does not necessarily improve oxygenation (Day et al. 1995; Bardell et al. 2019). Hypoxaemia can only be easily treated via ventilatorystrategies when hypoventilation is the reason for the hypoxaemia (Auckburally and Nyman 2017). Starting CMV also theoretically helps hypoxaemic horses which have signi cant proportion of regions with low _V=_Q, in which increasing ventilation might result in better matchingbetween ventilation and perfusion. However, if hypoxaemia iscaused by collapsed lung units representing atelectasis, routinely used CMV settings will not open up these lung units and, thus, hypoxaemia may persist. In this case, performing alveolar recruitment manoeuvres (ARM) followed by PEEP a) b) c) Fig 5: Graphical illustration of the effects of atelectasis on blood oxygenation. P iO2,PAO2,PaO2,Pv aO2,Sv and end-capillary blood; F iO2: inspired oxygen fraction. Graph a) Under normal conditions when inhaling air with aF iO2of 0.21 (21% of oxygen in room air) and a P iO2of around 150 mmHg (at sea level -21% of 760 mmHg atmospheric pressure), the PAO2is 100 mmHg. The mixed venous blood coming from the periphery reaching the lungs via the pulmonary artery has a S v O2of around 75% with a P v O2of 40 -45 mmHg. While passing through the lungs the haemoglobin gets fully saturated, resulting in S aO2of 100% with P aO2of around 100 mmHg. Graphs b, c) When atelectasis are present, despite inhaling air with a F iO2of 0.21 (21% of oxygen in room air) and a P iO2of around 150 mmHg (at sea level), only open alveoli will reach a P AO2of 100 mmHg; blood flowing through atelectatic lung regions cannot take up any oxygen. Thus, blood coming from the right side of the heart (mixed venous blood) and exiting the atelectatic lung unit have the same pressure of oxygen and haemoglobin oxygen saturation (P v O2=Pc'O2=45 mmHg; Sv O2=Sc'O2=75%). When mixing the poorly oxygenated blood from atelectatic lung units with the well-oxygenated blood from well- ventilated lung units, the P aO2and S aO2drop in a nonlinear fashion (55mHg and 83%, respectively) due to the sigmoid shape of the oxygen haemoglobin dissociation curve.

In summary, there can be no de nitive recommendation as to whether SB or CMV should be used in anaesthetised horses. The discrepancies in outcome between the studies comparing SB to CMV are due to different study populations, drug protocols, position, equipment, timing for interventions and ventilator settings amongst others. Hence, the anaesthetist should decide on a case-by-case basis if CMV should be used and when it should be initiated. Preview of part 2 In the second part of this review, we provide an overviewover the existing technologies that are commercially and noncommercially available to apply CMV in horses. Furthermore, we describe how to set up and deliver CMV in horses. Authors 'declarations of interest No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Part 1: How to optimise sampling approaches and a guide to agent detection testing methods F. M. Whitlock* and J. R. Newton British Horseracing Authority, London, author email: fleurwhitlock1@gmail.com Keywords: horse; infectious disease; laboratory; diagnostics Diagnostic testing is routinely performed by the equine clinician when dealing with suspected infectious disease cases and outbreaks. Optimal sample timing, choice and handling are fundamental to attain an accurate diagnosis, and a good understanding of laboratory-based sample analysis techniques, and their validation is necessary for effective diagnostic test result interpretation. This two-part series highlights the importance of interpreting results bearing testing limitations and speci c clinical ndings in mind, and on these foundations, the treating clinician should always bewell placed to deal with equine infectious diseases. Part 1 in this series will provide a treating clinician with an overview of the importance of testing horses in infectious disease outbreaks and how this is achieved. The different laboratory testing options available for agent detection and theirmethods will also be discussed. Part 2 will summarise serological (antibody) testing techniques, sample processing (including how tests are performed and validated) and result interpretation. Introduction Diagnosing an infectious disease outbreak in an accurate and timely manner is essential for the equine clinician. When presented with a suspect case, the decision to sample, the choice of sample and the laboratory technique to use is made under the pressure of many factors in a clinical setting. A clear understanding of optimal diagnostics and their interpretation is vital to assist those initial choices and ensure greatest diagnostic gain. Certain infectious diseases are endemic in the UK equine population and their persistence is aided by the widespread transport and mixing of horses. Endemic viral diseases include equine herpes virus-1 and fluenza 2017). The bacterial infection, strangles, caused by Streptococcus equi (S. equi) continues to be a common cause of disease outbreaks (Ivens et al . 2011; https://app.jshiny.com/jdata/ses/sesview/). An accurateand quick diagnosis ensures that appropriate treatment, prevention and biosecurity are instigated to reduce spread and lessen subsequent welfare, economic and even political impacts. Application of routine screening tests forpremovement and prebreeding help in reducing infectious transmission and preventing outbreaks, and continued awareness and monitoring for noti able or novel threats byequine clinicians is also crucial for the health of the nation 's horses. A more extensive guide to international infectious disease outbreak handling and eradication can be found in the HBLB International Codes of Practice (https://codes.hblb. org.uk/). Additional information on laboratory diagnostics for equine infectious diseases endemic to North America can be found in the AAEP Infectious Disease Guidelines (https://aae p.org/guidelines/infectious-disease-control/using-guidelines). Why test? There are numerous case scenarios that will warrant sampling. The common infectious disease sampling techniques and diagnostic tests available are summarised in Table 1 .I na n acute presentation of serous nasal discharge, mildlymphadenopathy, coughing and raised rectal temperature (>38.5 \u00b0C), there may be a high clinical suspicion of an infectious cause, but the actual agent involved may not beobvious clinically. There are many bene ts in pathogen con rmation; for the individual horse, for example, if the culprit is in fluenza virus, the animal can be closely monitored and well isolated, which is of paramount importance giventhe contagious nature of flu. For the in-contacts, clinical monitoring can be stepped up, samples can be taken forpreliminary screening tests and flu vaccinations administered to provide booster protection. For the wider community, strictbiosecurity should help ensure the outbreak is contained, with ongoing spread of the virus hopefully stopped in its tracks. For research, in fluenza virus strain analysis is necessary to assess the effectiveness of current commercially available vaccinesand ensure that they are updated in a timely manner as required (Martella et al . 2007). Decisions to take and test samples are in fluenced by both clinician- and owner-related factors. To what extent diagnostic testing improves health outcomes, relative to not performing tests, will be debated by clinicians; this is the concept of clinical utility (Bossuyt et al . 2012). Vets have a wider responsibility to the industry to reach a diagnosis in infectious disease cases and some schemes exist to encourage and aid this. Sample storage and transport If nasopharyngeal swabs are being taken, the swab in itssterilised packaging should be checked to ensure it is in date prior to use. After the animal has been sampled, the swab should be placed in appropriate transport media, to optimise of that organism in subsequent laboratory testing. Speci c sample transport media are used and may be provided by the receiving laboratory. For bacteriology (PCRand culture), a media containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fetal calf serum and amphotericin (antifungal) is suggested and this may also be used as a universal media for broader investigations, including viral PCR and is useful if requests are for conducting both bacteriology and virology (i.e. there is no need to take two swabs placed in separate media). If in fluenza virus is strongly suspected when taking a nasopharyngeal swab, this is best placed in PBS, tryptosephosphate broth, amphotericin and penicillin/streptomycin solution (antibiotics to prevent bacterial growth interfering with viral isolation techniques). Packaging of biological samples is subject to Health and Safety Executive legislation (HSE 2005). A sample must be ina leak-proof primary receptacle (e.g. the blood collection tube). Each of these is individually wrapped with absorbent material around the sample in case of leakage (e.g. cotton wool/paper towel). These are placed in a leak-proofsecondary packaging material (e.g. a sealed plastic bag) (Department for Transport 2020). The outer envelope should be marked with the following: 'UN3373 Category B Infectious Material 'or'Exempt animal specimen -nonhazardous '. The time from taking the sample to when it is received by the laboratory can be a challenge for a submitting clinician, but it is generally recommended that a sample should, wherever possible, be received by a testing laboratory within 2 days of sampling. With this in mind, use of guaranteed next day delivery is recommended as is avoiding samples being held up in the post over weekends and bank holidays. Laboratory submission forms should be lled out with as much information as possible. This is to ensure the laboratory is provided with suf cient history to aid assistance with best sample diagnostic test methods and result interpretations. Laboratory choice is also important, with only certain laboratories able to perform speci c, specialist tests. If a potential pathogen is noti able or zoonotic, contact the laboratory to ensure best sampling techniques and to con rmTABLE 1: Common sampling techniques and applicable diagnostic tests Case presentation Sample Test Additional information Investigative Acute upper respiratorytract infectionNasopharyngeal swab (obtain swabs from testinglaboratory, equi and S .zooepidemicusVirus-positive samples may undergo further testing by virus isolation, to determine viralstrains, to aid vaccine strain selection andresearch Clotted blood/serum (Plain blood tube)Serological rhinitis virusand S. equiFirst sample may not yet show evidence of infection (i.e. high antibody titre con rming an immune response).

Simply sending samples to the practice 's usual laboratory provider may incur additional delays and costs as this laboratory may not run the testinternally and will refer this sample to a specialist laboratory for testing before reporting the result themselves. Laboratory accreditations Once choice of sample(s) has been made and taken, it hasto be sent to the selected laboratory. In human laboratories, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency regulate medical devices (European Commission 2010). These regulations guarantee diagnostic tests undergo stringentvalidation to permit commercial availability. The operation of laboratories is regulated by Clinical Pathology Accreditation (CPA). CPA was operated by an independent organisation but during the last 5 years has become part of the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) and now is formerly a subsidiary of UKAS providing accreditation to ISO 15189 (Medical laboratories -Particular requirements for quality and competence). Veterinary laboratories are not governed bythe same requirements but some routinely subscribe to voluntary schemes. Such schemes are intended to improve quality assurance through implementing quality control, external quality assessment, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and competency assessments of personnel. Implementation of these should improve the quality of laboratory reporting by encompassing quality standards for the sample 's journey through the laboratory from sample receipt to result reporting. An example of a formal demonstration of this is accreditation to ISO 17025 (General requirements forcompetence of testing and calibration laboratories) by UKAS. The ISO 17025 standard requires implementation of a quality management system to guarantee valid results (International Standard Organization, 2017). Other external voluntary schemes include (although not an exhaustive list) a certi cated quality management system (ISO 9001) and participation in external quality assessment schemes such asUnited Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service (UK NEQAS), Animal Plant and Health Agencies (APHA) independent, accredited, pro ciency testing service (VETQAS) and Randox International Quality AssessmentScheme (RIQAS). Veterinary diagnostic testing does have to be regulated when it involves international export. A laboratory performing these tests must be either thegovernmental laboratory such as the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) in the UK or be a recognised reference laboratory by the relevant regulatory body such as World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) (http://www.oie.int/scie ntific-expertise/reference-laboratories/list-of-laboratories/). Agent detection diagnostic testing methods Agent detection diagnostic tests con rm the presence of an infectious agent or part thereof from potentially infected sites. Examples of samples from clinical cases for agent detection include a nasopharyngeal swab taken from a clinical case with signs potentially attributable to a viral upper respiratory tract infection or an aborted fetus and placenta undergoing post-mortem examination, histology and PCR to test for EHV-1 and of agent detection tests \u0081Simple sampling methods \u0081Direct assay for presence of microorganisms, appropriatefor acute disease presentation Disadvantages of agent detection tests \u0081Agent may not be present at the speci c site chosen for sampling \u0081Agent may be being intermittently shed, as is the casewhen taking nasopharyngeal swabs in suspect S. equi cases (Newton et al . 2000) \u0081Sampling a case further on in the disease process may yield a negative result, despite an infectious agent being the initial cause of disease \u0081With only culture used for agent detection, there may beloss of viable or culturable organism during transport, not a problem for PCR testing Polymerase chain reaction Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is now the most frequentlyused modality for agent detection. Molecular diagnostic tests look to use restricted but speci c genetic sequences to identify pathogen DNA or RNA in a sample ( Fig 1 ). Multiple infectious disease-causing agents may be screened for in a sample by a PCR panel (multiplexing). Advantages of PCR \u0081Rapid ( simple test with widely available technologies \u0081Relatively cheap, particularly with high volume testing \u0081Very sensitive with quantitative capacity \u0081Multiplexing allows screening for multiple agents simultaneously \u0081Capacity for high volume and automated samplethroughputs Disadvantages of PCR \u0081Chance for false positives from contamination due to hightest sensitivity \u0081Positive result may not indicate presence of viableorganism (dead pathogen DNA/RNA) \u0081No ability to detect novel viruses \u0081Can be subject to false negatives if loss of speci c genetic target in the infectious agent \u0081Multiplexing may suffer from reagent saturation reducing sensitivity (Webb et al . 2013). \u0081With increasing numbers of test kits available, the potentialexists for utilisation of poorly validated and potentially unreliable testing. Preparation of sample for PCR testing: 1 Extract DNA/RNA from sample (various methods available) 2 Add to a PCR mastermix. This pieces of synthetic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that are complementary to the DNA being ampli ed; there is one for each strand of separated DNA. If testing for an RNAvirus, the RNA is rst transcribed into a DNA copy (referred to as a complementary DNA or cDNA) using transcriptase before being ampli ed (commonly referred to as the RT step). 3 DNA polymerase (an enzyme that copies the DNA) is added to synthesise copies of the DNA strands. In end point PCR, in order to establish whether the target DNA/RNA is present in a sample, post-ampli cation processing gel electrophoresis is performed. This separates DNA fragments based on their size, with comparison to a laboratory-positive control. If the initial sample contained a single DNA molecule, after 30 cycles there would be 2^30 (just over one billion) copies of DNA (Butler 2012). There is no quanti cation of the amount of DNA in a sample using end point PCR. In relation to agent detection, having a quanti ed result for amount of DNA/RNA present is optimal as: \u0081A low copy number (i.e. a low number of copies of the DNA/RNA target within the pathogen and hence a low number of organisms) could be obtained if contamination has occurred at any level in the chain, suggesting that the result may be a false positive. \u0081Information about infective risk and disease stage can beestablished, particularly when re-sampling established cases at the end of an outbreak. If results are positive with a low copy number, this may suggest that the sample contained nonviable agent. Laboratories will report a result as either positive or negative, and each laboratory and test will have a speci c cut-off point for a positive or negative result, determined bythe amount of DNA/RNA in the sample. A sample could have DNA/RNA present but if the quanti ed amount is below the speci c cut-off for the test, the result will be de ned as negative. Laboratories can provide this quanti ed number, and this may be reported as either copy number or cyclethreshold (ct) value. Copy number gives a direct indication of the amount of DNA/RNA in a sample, with higher copynumber indicating higher amounts of pathogen. Conversely, ct value refers to the number of cycles of the test before DNA/RNA was detected at a given threshold. So, counter- intuitively higher ct values correspond to lower amounts of DNA/RNA and the lower the ct value, the fewer cycles were required to detect DNA/RNA at the threshold and the more DNA/RNA is present in the sample. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a real-time test with a very high sensitivity (can detect as little as 10 copies of DNA) and provides quantitative results on ampli ed DNA/RNA (Gibson et al . 1996). There is no need for post-ampli cation processing as the reaction and detection occur in real time in the same tube. Detection of this product is by monitoring increasing fluorescence, either using a DNA-binding dye or fluorescently labelled probes. The fluorescence signal intensity is directly proportional to the DNA concentration. The linear correlation between PCR product and fluorescence intensity can be used to calculate the amount of template presentat the beginning of the reaction by comparing the photodetector signal from the sample to a positive control with a known number of target sequence copies (Sharma et al . 1992). The fewer cycles it takes to reach the detectable level offluorescence, the greater the amount of DNA initially present. Laboratories running diagnostic PCRs should have numerous safety features in place to ensure results are reliable and valid. Sample quality is noted prior to testing as PCR inhibitors may be present in diagnostic samples. Asample with a high mucoid consistency or faecal contamination can decrease the test ef ciency and reduce sensitivity. An internal extraction control is run within oralongside the sample, to ensure the rst stage of the testing procedure is successful and determine that there are no PCRinhibitors present. Another safety feature for some PCRs available includes the use of multiple targets for the agent being tested for. If an agent 's genetic code had altered at one target, there will be additional targets within the test todetect its presence and avoid false-negative results arising Primer NucleotideSample DNA 1.

Using the correct sampling implement and transport media, as directed by the testing laboratory, enhances the test 's accuracy. Although viability-qPCR methods that can distinguish viable from nonviable organisms present in samples through pretreatment of nonviable organisms with DNA-binding dyes (Nocker et al. 2006) when received at the laboratory have been adopted in the food production and safety industry,these have yet to be widely adopted in the veterinary diagnostic setting. There are legitimate concerns that delays between sampling and laboratory receipt would give rise to falsely elevated relative measures of nonviable to viable organisms. Loop-mediated isothermal ampli cation Other molecular agent detection assays have been developed and are starting to be adopted in the diagnosis of equine infectious diseases. Notable among these is loop- mediated isothermal ampli cation (LAMP) assays, where DNA ampli cation and detection of a target gene can be done in a single step by incubating the sample, primers and DNA polymerase at a constant temperature, thereby negating the need for conventional PCR thermocycling equipment (Parida et al . 2008). Virus isolation Virus isolation (VI) was mainly used for agent detectionbefore the advent of PCR (Storch 2000). VI can be performed on a range of samples which includenasopharyngeal swabs, tracheal washes, whole blood (if looking for a viraemia), tissue samples (e.g. adult, foetal or placental), faeces or other material such as penile swabs or scabs. The time when an animal is shedding virus or is viraemic may be short, so if sampling is done outside of this window a negative result will arise, despite the case being infected (Allen and Breathnach 2010). VI is performed by using a variety of mammalian cell cultures in tissue culture media; these include but are not limited to equine, rabbit or canine kidney cell lines. The clinical sample is inoculated onto these living cells, and the cells are examined daily to look for signs of cytopathic effect (CPE), indicative of viral infection ( Fig 2 ). Embryonated chicken eggs can also be used and would most commonly be used for growinginfluenza viruses.In a clinical sampling setting, VI can also be used once a positive diagnosis has been con rmed by PCR, to determine whether the virus was viable at the time of sampling. Viabilityis affected by post-sampling factors and these can be optimised by avoiding storing samples in a hot car and ensuring a quick delivery to the receiving laboratory. VI can also be used to screen biological products prior to commercial availability. VI is an integral test for research purposes as it enables subsequent genome sequencing of the viral isolates and retention of viable virus that may be required by vaccine manufacturers. This is of particular importance for in fluenza, as the in fluenza virus is always changing, it is paramount that the virus is geneticallymonitored, to ensure quick identi cation if a viral change does occur as vaccine updates may then be required. Advantages of VI \u0081High speci city, especially when combined with virus- speci c con rmatory immunoassays \u0081Can be used to look for novel virus presence and virusesthat are not detected by currently available PCR tests \u0081Allows viruses to be characterised by downstream genomesequencing and possible detection of changes in antigenicity. This information can be used to ensure vaccines are up to date and diagnostic PCRs remain viable \u0081Allows viruses to be puri ed and grown up for use in vaccine production Disadvantages of VI \u0081Requires viable virus in the sample and this can be affected by factors contributing to viral viability during sample collection and transportation \u0081The speci c cell type used will in fluence the success of the test, different viruses will prefer certain cell types \u0081Labour intensive and requires skilled and experiencedpersonnel \u0081Slow diagnostic test, can take up to a few weeks asrequires several passages in cell culture before a negative result can be issued Immunohistochemistry and immuno fluorescence for antigen detection Antiviral antibodies linked to an indicator system can be used to detect whether virus is present in tissues.

If virus is present, a colour change occurs (Bourgeois and Oaks 2014). IHC is the optimal choice as it can be performed on formalin- xed, paraf n-embedded tissue sections. IHC is also very sensitive, speci c and low cost (Bourgeois and Oaks 2014). Bacterial culture Samples are inoculated on to selected growth media andincubated under speci c optimised conditions of temperatures and gas levels, dependent on the bacteria of interest. Once grown, colonies will be visually analysed and may be classi ed based on their morphological characteristics. Further testing onisolates is usually required, however, to speci cally identify them. This often includes assessment of their ability to fermentspeci c sugars and analytical pro le index (API) test results. API involves a series of biochemical experiments in a commercialtest panel, with results from each test used to classify the bacteria. An example of a necessity for further testing is in the case of distinction between S. equi and Streptococcus zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) . Morphologically, rmed as a b-haemolytic streptococcus on blood agar culture and then sugar fermentation is employedfor further classi cation, although these are not infallible. S. zooepidemicus ferments various different sugars that S. equi isolates do not (Kuwamoto et al . 2001); however, some rare strains of S. zooepidemicus will have acquired biochemical pathway deletions leading to failure to ferment these sugars and their misidenti cation as S. equi . Antimicrobial susceptibility testing helps clinicians choose optimal antimicrobials, ensuringfast and successful case responses and risk reduction for antimicrobial resistance development (Weese 2015). Direct microscopy Cytological samples are evaluated by microscopy, with the aid of stains. Wright 's stain enables evaluation of inflammatory cells and bacteria. Visualisation of intracellular bacteria, for example on a tracheal wash, is suggestive of a bacterial infection (Cian et al . 2015). Further staining with Gram-stain will detect bacteria and enable classi cation. Conclusion Achieving the correct diagnosis in a suspect infectious disease case is improved by having an enhanced understanding of a sample 's'journey 'from sample acquisition, to laboratory reporting and the stages in between. Agent detectionmethods and their limitations have been discussed and theseshould be considered when interpreting test results. Ruling out infectious disease is frequently not as simple as obtaining a single negative laboratory result and clinicians are encouraged to work closely with laboratories when dealing with suspect infectious disease outbreaks to risk assess the implications of both positive and negative laboratory results.
