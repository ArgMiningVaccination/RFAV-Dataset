Out of body experiences, energy healing, energetic connections between people, psychic work and everything in between. This sub is open for discussion, learning and teaching, without judgement, on any and every form of energy work regardless of degree of social acceptability or stigma. So growing up I would always go to this one place that does chiropractic, but it's not the type of place that cracks your back or uses some sort of bumper to knock your spine around. They have you lay down in certain positions, they take all the proper x-rays, they pull out the protractor to figure out all the correct angles... But when it comes time to actually work on your body they don't touch you. They do this motion as if doing some sort of Tai chi. As if they are pushing energy into your body where it needs it and then suddenly you may feel some of your muscles loosen up or some of your bones shift slightly. Over the next 2 days your back realigns itself to where it should be. And I know that this is not a pseudo effect because the same technique is what cured my dad's limp that he had for 10 years. No other doctors were able to fix it. One of his legs was literally one or two inches shorter than the other. After finishing the treatment all of his pain went away and he no longer had a limp. His back was straight and in good condition. So having experienced this all my life, one day my mother says that her back hurts. She also says that a friend of hers was able to help her a couple years ago by pouring energy into her and visualizing the back straightening itself. Probably wasn't as accurate as a trained chiropractor, but it seems possible and like it would be worth a try. I traced my fingers up and down my mother's spine to figure out where the curves were and around the upper part of her back her spine made a sudden 1 inch shift to the right and then back to center again. And that's where she was experiencing some pain. So I visualized surging energy in my palms, and I used the energy to push waves of force at the bones to push them into position. They moved. It worked. She immediately felt better and her back was straight. I didn't touch her except to figure out the curvature of the spine. Interesting thing is, a day later her back was beginning to become a little bit sore again. And so I did the check again and I realized that her spine didn't stop moving after I was done. It kept drifting like a boat in water. It had drifted to the other side. The opposite side. We had her go in to see the family chiropractor after that and they were able to do it precisely. (Surely that's why they have protractors. Right?) This is contrary to the belief that energy always knows how to do everything perfectly on its own. And it's also interesting that there can be a delayed effect that keeps working after you're done applying the energy. I have not heard this technique being described specifically anywhere on the internet. Even the chiropractor doesn't want to go into how it works. Probably from fear of having to explain it to a wider audience that might not be as accepting of it. My theory is that I might learn something about this if I learn reiki or quantum touch. It might be something else though. Still not sure. I'd like to learn more about it and see what else is possible. Going to read more posts in this subreddit to see what else is here. "}
