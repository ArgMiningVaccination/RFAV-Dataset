Read on to learn all about the meridians, the elements, and where crystals fit into the mix. Acupuncture is an ancient healing tradition used to create balance in the body. The technique involves inserting ultra-fine needles into specific acupuncture points located along the meridians of the body. The goal of acupuncture is to encourage the flow of energy, called Qi, throughout the body. When this isn't flowing correctly, illness and disease often result. Combining healing crystals with acupuncture can increase the effects of both healing modalities.
