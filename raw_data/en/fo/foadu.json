Metabolism is the process by which your body converts consumed food and beverages into a source of energy. Energy balance refers to the relationship between calories taken into the body and calories being used in the body (i.e., physical activity) for our daily energy requirements. Studies which explore changes in body weight and composition are included in this category. Past and current research projects and activities involving metabolism and energy balance: - Adaptation of energy and substrate metabolism to short and long-term changes in diet composition and energy balance - The effects of weight management programs on ethnic minority and pediatric populations - Effects of specific dietary components on energy metabolism and body composition - Role of circadian rhythm on body weight and energy balance "}
