They are designed to provide information and assist decision making. They are not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one. Neither should they be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. This Clinical Practice Guideline is based on a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence. Developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts, it provides a clear explanation of the logical relationships between various care options and health outcomes while rating both the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendation. Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every healthcare professional making use of these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation. These guidelines are not intended to represent Department of Veterans Affairs or TRICARE policy. Further, inclusion of recommendation s for specific testing and/or therapeutic interventions within these guidelines does not guarantee coverage of civilian sector care.

Introduction The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence -Based Practice Work Group (EBPWG) was established and first chartered in 2004, with a mission to advise the Health Executive Committee (HEC) \"...on the use of clinical and epidemiological evidence to improve the health of the population...\" across the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Military Health System (MHS), by facilitating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) fo r the VA and DoD populations. [1] This CPG is intended to provide healthcare providers with a framework by which to evaluate, treat, and manage the individual needs and preferences of patie nts at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD), thereby leading to improved clinical outcomes. In 2014, the VA and DoD published an updated CPG for the Primary Care Management of CKD (2014 CKD CPG), which was based on evidence reviewed through January 2013. Since the release of that guideline, a growing body of research has expanded the general knowledge and understanding of CKD. Consequently, a recommendation to update the 2014 CKD CPG was initiated in 2018. The updated CPG includes objective, evidence -based information on the management of CKD. It is intended to assist healthcare providers in all aspects of patient care, including, but not limited to, screening, assessment, treatment, and follow -up. The system -wide goal of evidence -based guidelines is to improve the patient's health and well -being by guiding health providers who are taking care of patients with CKD along management pathways that are supported by evidence. The expected outcome of successful implementation of this guideline is to: Assess the patient's condition and determine, in collaboration with the patient, the best treatment method Optimize each individual's health outcomes and improve quality of life (QoL) Minimize preventable complications and morbidity Emphasizing the use o f patient -centered care (PCC) II. Background A. Description of Chronic Kidney Disease CKD is defined as an abnormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or a normal GFR with other markers of kidney disease such as proteinuria, hematuria, or abnormal images of the kidneys. In 2002, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) published treatment guidelines that delineated five stages of CKD based on declining estimated GFR (eGFR) measurements. [2] Subsequently, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) released a CKD guideline in 201 2 which further subdivided stage 3 CKD and added subdivisions for albuminuria in each s tage. [3] The stages of CKD are described in Algorithm: Module C, Sidebar s 9a and 9b . For any given stage of CKD, the presence of albuminuria, designated as categories A1 - A3, is associated with an increase d risk of CKD progression. Mortality increases with each higher stage of CKD. Even advanced CKD can be asymptomatic until uremic symptoms develop, at which time renal replacement is required. Interventions described in this CPG can slow the progression of CKD and reduce VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 7 of 159 mortality. However, as discussed in Recommendat ion 1 , universal screening or even screening of higher risk populations may not always be indicated . B. Epidemiology and Impact in the General Population The overall prevalence of CKD (Stages 1 -5) in the adult general population in the United States (U.S. ) was 14.8% between 2013 and 2016. [4] Only 9% of patients with CKD are aware of their kidney disease despite efforts to raise community awareness. [5] The prevalence of CKD increases with age and peaks after the age of 70. [6] CKD c an be caused by several conditions that are more prevalent with advancing age . C. CKD in the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs Populations There is no published data on the prevalence of CKD in the military. Any data from the military would be biased because the presence of CKD could be an exclusion criterion for continued active service. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) took data from both the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the VA databases to determine the prevalence of CKD in the general population and the VA respectively. [6] The NHANES dataset covered the years of 1999 to 2016 and included patients with CKD stages 1 -4 based on the presence of albuminuria or an eGFR less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The prevalence ranged from 13 -16%. The VA dataset covered the years of 2005 to 2018 and included Veterans with CKD stages 3 -5 based on an eGFR of less than 60 mL /min/1.73 m2. Stages 1 and 2 were not included because of the lack of urine albumin measurements. [6] An abstract by Saran et.al. (2016) reported the prevalence of U.S. Veterans with CKD could range from 16.4 % to 36.3% if a restricted or liberal definition is used. [7] This combined data suggests that CKD is probably more prevalent in the Veteran population. The most important comorbid conditions contributing to CKD are hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) , both of which can be exacerbated by overweight and obesity . These comorbid conditions are all more prevalent in the Veteran population compared to the general U.S. population, which may ex plain the increased prevalence of CKD in Veterans. [8-10] Other contributors to CKD in Veterans could be related to occupational hazards experienced in the military, such as burn pits, Agent Orange, radiation , or other exposures ( see Appendix M ). III. About this Clinical Practice Guideline This updated guideline represents a significant step toward improving the management of CKD in the VA and DoD. As with other CPGs however, challenges remain, including evidence gaps, the need to develop effective strategies for guideline implementation, and the need to evaluate the effect of guideline adherence on clinical outcomes. This guideline is intended for VA and DoD primary care practitioners, including physicians, physician assistants , and nurse practitioners, as well as nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, CKD educators, social workers, care managers, and others who care for patients with CKD. As elaborated in the qualifying statement on page one , this CPG is not intended to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns evolve. This CPG is based on scientific publications available by November 2018 , and is intended to provide a general guide to best practices. For selected topics (i.e ., use of sodium -glucose co -1] receptor agonists), a limited update of the literature was performed to VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 8 of 159 capture important e vidence published after November 2018. The guideline can assist care providers, but the guidance of a CPG must always be considered within the context of patient values and preferences and a provider's clinical judgment, for the care of an individual patie nt. A. Methods The current document is an update to the 2014 CKD CPG . The methodology used in developing the 2019 CPG follows the Guideline for Guidelines , an internal document of the VA and DoD EBPWG that was updated in January 2019. [11] The Guideline for Guidelines can be downloaded from http://www.healthquality.va.gov/policy/index.asp . This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) and other subject matter experts from within the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group, and ultimately, the development and submission of a new or updated CKD CPG. The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence -based clinical practice recommendations , and writing and publishing a guideline document to be used by providers within the VA/DoD healthcare systems as well as those within the community who treat individuals within the VA and DoD . Specifically, the Champions and Work Group members for this guideline were responsible for identifying the key questions (KQs) of the most clinical relevance, importance , and interest for the management of CKD . The Champions and the Work Group also provided direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the evidence review and assessed the level and quality of the evidence. The amount of new scientific evidence that had accumulated since the previous version of the CPG w as also taken into consideration in the identification of the KQs. In addition, the Champions assisted in: Identifying appropriate disciplines of individuals to be included as part of the Work Group Directing and coordinating the Work Group Participating t hroughout the guideline development and review processes The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Office of Evidence Based Practice, U.S. Army Medical Command, the proponent for CPGs for the DoD, identified four clinical leaders, Christopher Dyer, MD, FACP, and Jeffrey Penfield, MD, from the VA, and Mai Nguyen, MD, FACP, FASN, and Lt Col Jonathan Sosnov, MD, MSc , from t he DoD , as Champions for the 201 9 CPG. The Lewin Team, including The Lewin Group, Duty First Consulting, ECRI Institute, and Sigma Health Consulting, LLC, was contracted by the VA and DoD to support the development of this CPG and conduct the evidence review. The first conference call was held in April 2018, with participation from the contracting officer's representative (COR), leaders from the VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value and the DoD Office of Evidence Based Practice, and the Champions. During this call, participants discussed the sc ope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing and prioritizing specific research questions on which to base a systematic review (SR) about the assessment and manageme nt of patients at risk for CKD. The group also identified a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to the management of CKD , from which Work Group members were recruited. The specialties and clinical areas of in terest included: behavioral health, geriatrics, nephrology, nursing, nutrition, primary care, social work and pharmacology. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 9 of 159 The guideline development process for the 2019 CPG update consisted of the following steps: 1. Formulating and prioritizing KQs and de fining critical outcomes 2. Convening a patient focus group 3. Conducting the systematic evidence review 4. Convening a face -to-face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group members 5. Drafting and submitting a final CPG on the management of CKD to the VA/DoD EBP WG Appendix A provides a detailed description of each of these tasks. a. Grading Recommendations The Champions and Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a strength for each recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation :[25] Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Confidence in the quality of the evidence Patient or provider values and preferences Other implications, as appropriate, e.g.: Resource use Equity Acceptability Feasibility Subgroup considerations Using these four domains, the Work Group determined the relative strength of each recommendation (\"Strong\" or \"Weak\"). A \"Strong\" recommendation generally indicates a high confidence in the quality of the available scientific evidence, a clear difference in magnitude between the benefits and harms of an intervention, similar patient or provider values and preferences, and understood influence of other implications (e.g., resource use, feasibility). If the Work Group has less confidence after the assessment across these domains and believes that additional evidence may change the recommendation, it generally assigns a \"Weak\" recommendation. It is important to note that the GRADE terminology used to indicate the assessment across the four domains (i.e., \"Stro ng\" versus \"Weak\") should not be confused with the clinical importance of the recommendation. A \"W eak\" recommendation may still be important to the clinical care of a patient with CKD. Occasionally, instances may occur when the Work Group determine s that there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against a particular therapy or preventive measure. This can occur when there is an absence of studies on a particular topic that met evidence review inclusion criteria, studies included in the evidence review report conflicting results, or studies included in the evidence review report inconclusive results regarding the desirable and undesirable outcomes. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 10 of 159 Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum: Strong for (or \"We recommend offering this option...\") Weak for (or \"We suggest offering this option...\") No recommendation for or against (or \"There is insufficient evidence...\") Weak against (or \"We suggest not offering this option...\") Strong against (or \"We recommend against offering this option...\") The grade of each recommendation made in the 201 9 CPG can be found in the section on Recommendations . Additional information regarding the use of the GRADE system can be fou nd in Appendix A. b. Reconciling 20 14 Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendations Evidence -based CPGs should be current, which typically requires revisions of previous guidelines based on new evidence, or as scheduled and subject to time -based expirations. [12] For example, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has a process for refining or otherwise updating its recommendations pertaining to preventive services.[ 13] The CKD CPG Work Group focused largely on developing new and updated recommendations based on the evidence review conducted for the priority areas addressed by the KQs. In addition to those new and updated recommendations, the Work Group considered, without complete review of the relevant evidence, the c urrent applicability of other recommendations that were included in the 20 14 CKD CPG, subject to evolving practice in today's environment. A set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excelle nce (NICE). [14,15] These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which older recommendations could have been updated. In brief, the categories took into account whether or not the evidence that related to a recommendation w as systematically reviewed, the degree to which a recommendation was modified, and the degree to which a recommendation is relevant in the current care environment and within the scope of the CPG. Additional information regarding these categories and their definitions can be found in Recommendation Categorization . The categories for the recommendations included in the 201 9 version of the guideline can be found in the section on Recommendations . The categories for the recommendations carried forward from the 2014 CKD CPG are noted in Appendix D . The CPG Work Group considered the strength of the evidence cited for each recommendation in the 2014 CKD CPG as well as the intervention's harms and benefits, values and preferences, and other implications, where possible. The CPG Work Group referred to the available evidence as summarized in the body of the 2014 CKD CPG and did not systematically reassess the evidence. In some instances, relevant peer -reviewed literature published since the 2014 CKD CPG was considered along with the original evidence base for the specific recommendation. Where such newer literature was considered, it is referenced in the discussion that follows the corresponding recommendation, as well as in Appendix C . VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 11 of 159 The CPG Work Group recognizes that while there are sometimes practical reasons for incorporating findings fr om a previous SR , previous recommendations, [16] or recent peer -reviewed publ ications into an updated CPG, doing so does not involve an original, comprehensive SR and therefore may introduce bias . c. Peer Review Process The CPG was developed through an iterative process in which the Work Group produced multiple drafts of the document . The process for developing the initial draft is described in more detail in Drafting and Submitting the Final Clinical Practice Guideline . Once a near -final draft of the guideline was agreed upon by the Champions and Work Group members, the draft was sent out for peer review and comment. The draft was posted on a Wiki website for a period of 14 business days. The peer reviewers comprised individuals working within the VA and DoD healthcare systems as well as experts from relevant outside organizations designated by the Work Group members. Organizations designated by the Work Group to participate in the peer review and who provided feedback include the following: American Society of Nephrolo gy National Kidney Foundation The VA and DoD Leadership reached out to both the internal and external peer reviewers to solicit their feedback on the CPG. Reviewers were provided a hyperlink to the W iki website where the draft CPG was posted. All feedback from the peer reviewers was discussed and considered by the Work Group. Modifications made throughout the CPG development process were made in accordance with the evidence . B. Summary of Patient Focus Group Methods and Findings When forming guideline recommendations, consideration should be given to the values of those most affected by the recommendations: patients. Patients bring perspectives, values, and preferences into their healthcare experience that can vary from those of clinicians. These differences can affect decision making in various situations, and should thus be highlighted and made explicit due to their potential to influence a recommendation's implementation. [17,18] Focus groups can be used as an efficient method to explore ideas and perspectives of a group of individuals and collect qualitative data on a thoughtfully predetermined set of questions. Therefore, as part of the effort to update this CPG, VA and DoD Leadership, along with the CKD CPG Work Group, held a patient focus group on June 11, 2018, at the Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital - South Texas Veterans Health Care System in San Antonio, TX. The aim of the focus group was to further understand and incorporate the perspective of patients who are living with CKD and who are covered and/or receiving their care through the VA and/or DoD healthcare systems, as these patients are most affected by the recommendations put forth in the CPG. The focus group delved into the patients' and their families' perspectives on a set of topics related to their CKD management, including their priorities, challenges they have experienced, and the information they received regarding their care, as well as the impacts of their care on their lives . VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 12 of 159 It is important to note that the focus groups comprised a convenience sample and the Work Group recognizes the lack of generalizability and other limitations inherent in the small sample size. Fewer than 10 people in total were included in the focus group to be consistent with the requirements of the F ederal Paperwork Reduction Act, 1980. The Work Group acknowledges that the sample included in the focus group is not representative of all patients within the VA and DoD healthcare systems. Further, time limitations for the focus group prevented exhaustive exploration of all topics related to CKD management in VA and DoD and the patients' broader experiences with their care. Thus, the Work Group made decisions regarding the priority of topics to discuss at the focus group. These limitations, as well as oth ers, were considered during guideline development as the information collected from the discussion was being used. Recruitment for participation in the focus group was managed by the Champions and VA and DoD Leadership, with assistance from coordinators at the facility at which the focus group took place. The following concepts are ideas and suggestions about aspects of care that are important to patients who are living with CKD and emerged as recurring themes during the discussions ( Table 1 ). These concepts were important parts of the participants' care and added to the Work Group's understanding of patient values and perspectives. Additional details regarding the patient focus group methods and findings can be found in Appendix B . Table 1. CKD CPG Focus Group Concepts CKD CPG Patient Focus Group Concepts A. Recognize the importance of communication and collaboration between care providers, particularly between nephrologists and primary care. B. Understand patient -specific goals, priorities, values, and preferences and use shared decision making to develop a patient -centered plan for treatment. Patients greatly value quality of life and the ability to maintain their lifestyle. C. Educate patients about their kidney disease. Diagnosis often comes as a shock to patients, and understanding why they have kidney disease is of great importance to them. Patients often fear that exposure to chemicals during their military deployment may have led to their CKD. D. Provide nutrition and dietary guidance keeping in mind patient's individual lifestyle and cultural differences. The patients who had seen a dietitian stated that it helped them adhere to their nutrition plan while those who did not reported difficulty maintaining a healthy diet. E. Patients' biggest fear regarding their kidney disease is having to go on dialysis; they observed others on dialysis and inferred what it would be like for them. Educating patients about the e xperience of dialysis may alleviate their fears and give them a better understanding of their treatment options. F. Create a support group for kidney disease patients. Patients have a number of fears regarding their kidney disease, particularly having to go on dialysis, and may benefit from discussing these issues with other patients at various stages of CKD. G. Offer telemedicine and other technology options to augment care, but recognize these options may not align with the preferences of all patients. Abbr eviations: CKD: Chronic Kidney Disease C. Potential Conflicts of Interest At the start of this guideline development process and at other key points throughout, the project team was required to submit disclosure statements to reveal any areas of potential conflict of interest (COI) in the past 24 months. Verbal affirmations of no COI were used as necessary during meetings throughout the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 13 of 159 guideline development process. The project team was also subject to random web- based surveillance (e.g., Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services open payments or ProPublica). If a project team member reported a COI (actual or potential), then it was reported to the Office of Evidence Based Practice. It was also discussed with the CKD CPG Champions in tandem with their rev iew of the evidence and development of recommendations. The Office of Evidence Based Practice and the CKD CPG Champions determined whether or not action, such as restricting participation and/or voting on sections related to the conflict or removal from the Work Group, was necessary. If it was deemed necessary, action to mitigate the COI was taken by the Champions and Office of Evidence Based Practice, based on the level and extent of involvement. No COIs were identified for the CKD CPG Work Group members o r Champions. Disclosure forms are on file with the VA Evidence Based Practice Program office and available upon request . D. Scope of this Clinical Practice Guideline Regardless of setting, any patient in the healthcare system should ideally have access to the interventions that are recommended in this guideline after taking into consideration the patient's specific circumstances. Guideline recommendations are intended to be patient centered. Thus, treatment and care should take into account a patient's needs and preferences. Good communication between healthcare professionals and the patient is essential and should be supported by evidence -based information tailored to the patient's needs. Use of an empathetic and non- judgmental approach facilitates discussions sensitive to gender, cultur al, ethnic, and other differences. The information that patients are given about treatment and care should be culturally appropriate and available to people with limited literacy skills. It should also be accessible to people with additional needs such as physical, sensory, or learning disabilities. Family involvement should be considered, if appropriate. This CPG is designed to assist p roviders in managing or co -managing patients undergoing treatment for CKD. The patient population of interest for this CPG is patients who are living with CKD and are eligible for care in the VA and DoD healthcare delivery systems. It includes Veterans as well as deployed and non- deployed Active Duty Service, Guard, and Reserve Members and their dependents . E. Highlighted Features of this Clinical Practice Guideline The 2019 edition of the VA/DoD CKD CPG is the fourth update to the original CPG. It provides practice recommendations for CKD as well as guidance for specialty referral. A particular strength of this CPG is the multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement from its inception, ensuring representation from the bro ad spectrum of clinicians engaged in the treatment and management of CKD with and without co -occurring conditions. The framework for recommendations in this CPG considered factors beyond the strength of the evidence, including balancing desired outcomes w ith potential harms of the intervention, equity of resource availability, the potential for variation in patient values and preferences, and other considerations (e.g., acceptability of the intervention, subgroup considerations) as appropriate. Applicability of the evidence to VA/DoD populations was also taken into consideration. An algorithm accompanies the guideline to provide an overview of the recommendations in the context of the flow of patient care and to assist with training VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 14 of 159 providers (see the Algorithm ). The algorithm may be used to help facilitate translation of guideline recommendations into effective practice . F. Patient -centered Care VA/DoD CPGs encourage clinicians to use a PCC approach that is individualized based on patient needs, characteristics, and preferences. Regardless of setting, all patients in the healthcare system should be able to access evidence -based care appropriate to that patient. When properly executed, PCC may decrease patient anxiety, increase trust in clinicians, and improve treatment adherence. [19-21] Improved patient - clinician communication and a PCC approach conveys openness and supports disclosure of current and future concerns. As part of the PCC approach, clinicians should ensure that the patient understands their medical condition and the outcomes and expe riences of similar patients who are living with CKD. They should elicit the patient's goals of care and explore any concerns, barriers, or outcomes they wish to avoid. T hey should inform the patient about any decisions that need to be made and involve the m in shared decision making (SDM) regarding management of CKD. With the patient's permission, members of the patient's trusted support system should be encouraged to participate in these discussions to ensure they understand the patient's condition, treatme nt decisions, and their role in supporting the management of CKD. Patients should be allowed time to adjust to serious news about diagnosis and progression of illness before being asked to discuss goals of care and treatment decisions . G. Shared Decision M aking Throughout this VA/DoD CPG, the authors encourage clinicians to focus on SDM. The SDM model was introduced in Crossing the Quality Chasm, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now called the National Academy of Medicine [NAM]) report, in 2001. [22] It is readily apparent that patients should make decisions regarding their plan of care and management options together with their clinicians. The unique role of SDM in nephrology care has been previously recognized in CPGs published by the Renal Physicians Association.[ 23] Clinicians must be adept at presenting infor mation to their patients regarding individual treatments, expected outcomes, and levels and/or setting s of care , taking into account the patient's learning needs and information they want to know . Through SDM , treatment plans are individualized based on pa tient capabilities, needs, goals , and preferences . H. Co-occurring Conditions Co-occurring medical and mental health conditions are important to recognize because they can modify the management of CKD, patient or provider treatment priorities, clinical decisions, and the provider s with whom management of CKD and ongoing healthcare will be delivered. Providers should expect that many Veterans, Service Members, and their family will have one or more co -occurring health conditions. For example, one analysis of 821,334 Veterans with CKD between January 1, 2005 , and December 31, 2008, found that 81% had three or more conditions in addition to CKD. [24] In addition to commonly co -occurring chronic conditions (e.g. , DM, hypertension), older Veterans with CKD often have geriatric conditions such as cognitive impairment or are at high risk for falls. For example, in U.S. population -based studies of older adults, cognitive impairment occurred in 15% of those with an eGFR 45 -59 mL/minute/1.73 m2 19% of those with eGFR <45 mL/minute/1.73 m2.[25] Among older Veterans with CKD who had geriatric assessment, more than 25% had cognitive impairment that had not been previously identified. [26] VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 15 of 159 Because management of CKD usually takes place in parallel with ongoing care for co -occurring conditions, it is generally best to manage CKD in collaboration with the care for other health conditions that are being treated in primary or specialty care.

The algorithm serves as a tool to prompt providers to consider key decision points in the course of car e. Although this CPG represents the recommended practice on the date of its publication, clin ical practice is evolving and this evolution requires continuous updating based on published information. New technology and more research will improve patient care in the future. The CPG can assist in identifying priority areas for research and informing optimal allocation of resources. Future studies examining the results of CPG implementation may lead to the development of new evidence particularly relevant to clinical practice .

Algorithm This CPG follows an algorithm that is designed to facilitate understanding of the clinical pathway and decision -making process used in the management of CKD. The use of the algorithm format as a way to represent patient management was chosen based on the understanding that such a format ma y promote more efficient diagnostic and therapeutic decision making and has the potential to change patterns of resource use. Although the Work Group recognizes that not all clinical practices are linear, the simplified stepwise approach depicted through t he algorithm and its format allows the provider to assess the critical information needed at the major decision points in the clinical process. It include s: An ordered sequence of steps of care Recommended observations and examinations Decisions to be con sidered Actions to be taken For each guideline, there is a corresponding clinical algorithm that is depicted by a step -by-step decision tree.

A. Diagnosis Assessment and Lab Monitoring Recommendation 1. In the general population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against periodic evaluation for chronic kidney disease. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion There is a rational expectation that screening high -risk populations for kidney disease may be helpful. Optimally, to make a recommendation on screening, there would be evidence such as a randomized cont rolled trial ( RCT) with clinical endpoints that randomly assign patients, providers, or practices to either screening or usual care strategies. No such trial has been conducted. Furthermore, t here are three key assumptions for screening which are not clear from observational studies or even analytical models. Key assumptions for the effectiveness of screening include identification of unrecognized/ unrecognized CKD, modification of treatment not otherwise used in individuals with occult CKD, and efficacy of treating early CKD states to reduce risk of progression and improve outcomes . The key assumptions for screening to be effective are the presence of u ndetected/unrecognized disease . Not only is there no data on clinical outcomes of screening, but the impact on patients is also unclear. There are potential benefits and harms of CKD screening, but neither are well defined. Potential benefits include improved identification of patients with CKD with the opportunity to slow CKD progression with treatment. In addition, patients with VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 31 of 159 CKD have elevated cardiovascular disease ( CVD) risk, and prevention efforts could be implemented or intensified. Potential harms include risk of over- diagnosis and \"labeling\" patients with a diagnosis (at this point not quantified, more intangible), which could include negative impacts on patient finances, employment status, their family members, psychosocial and mental health, and insurance coverage. Information from the patient focus g roup suggest that patients are often surprised and anguished by the diagnosis of CKD and they want assurance that there is a clear cause of their condition and an action plan. However, there may not be a clear cause or action plan. In the absence of evidence, the conflict over screening becomes evident with proponents decrying the nihilism of doing nothing and the other side repeating the mantra of \"f irst do no harm. \" The 2014 CKD CPG used expert opinion to recommend that high- risk populations should benefi t from screening; however, screening and treatment strategies have not been evaluated in a rigorous RCT , and there remain s insufficient evidence to recommend for or against periodic evaluation to screen for CKD, even in high -risk populations. This current recommendation is based on very low quality evidence on interventions to reduce the risk of CVD events from the 2018 evidence revie w [29] and evidence carried forward from the 2008 and 2014 versions of the CKD CPG. [30] Providers have a responsibility to their patients to ensure that screening efforts are accompanied by strong evidence and that there is the opportunity to counsel patients about treatment plans. Although there is an absence of evidence to support widespread screening, clinicians are encouraged to offer CKD screening to high- risk patients, particularly in instances where the recognition of kidney disease may alter therapy or afford opportuni ty for preventive management (see Algorithm: Module A ). The decision to screen for CKD should be individualized, based on SDM with the patient. There is debate among the Work Group as to which patients might benefit from screening based on interpretations of available information and practice patterns. The Work Group recommends that future research be prioritized to identify the most promising population(s) for potential CKD screening, the optimal method to us e for screening, and to evaluate the impact of screening interventions versus usual care on outcomes that are important to patients, providers, and healthcare systems. A formal recommendation on screening requires evidence with appropriate clinical endpoints for a specific patient population using a specific screening methodology compared to usual care or no screening. However, RCTs have not yet been conducted for CKD and may not be conducted. The impact of screening on patient outcomes and well -being remai ns unclear, even from observational studies, and may differ between patient groups and individual patients. As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant evidence [ 29] and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2008 and 2014 CPGs. [30] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low. CKD screening in the ge neral population remains controversial with conflicting statements among professional organizations .[31,32] A lthough it may appear empirically that early detection of CKD should be beneficial, screening and treatment strategies have not been evaluated in rigorous research. Therefore, while the Work Group concluded that a definitive evidence -based recommendation for or against CKD screening in the general population cannot be made at this time, th e Work Group felt CKD screening decisions should be considered on an individual patient basis, taking into account risk factors, implications of the diagnosis, the likelihood of changes in patient management, and patient preferences (see Algorithm: Module A) . VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 32 of 159 Recommendation 2. When screening or stratifying risk for chronic kidney disease, we recommend including urine albumin -to-creatinine ratio testing in addition to estimated glomerular filtration rate to optimize the diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease. (Strong for |Reviewed, New -added) Discussion The combined impact of eGFR and albuminuria allow for a more complete evaluation of risk for CKD complications. Patient -level meta -analyses that included 1 05,872 people from 14 with measures of urine albumin- to-creatinine ( uACR ) and 1,128,310 people from seven studies with urine dipstick testing for proteinuria in addition to serum creatinine (SCr) measures demonstrated that albuminuria substantially impr oved risk prediction for CVD, mortality, and end -stage renal disease (ESRD) at all levels of eGFR. [3] These findings are based on spot collections of urine and calculated uACR s and are well illustrated in Figure 7 of the KDIGO CKD definition and classification article (not included in our SR and not contributing to the strength of the recommendation). [3] There appeared to be a steadily increasing risk for adverse outcomes with higher values of the uACR , which emphasizes that the uACR should be reported as a numerical value, if possible, and not as a categorical result. For CKD staging, the clinical categories for uACR that are typically used are <30, 30 to <300, and 300 mg/g, although the risk gradient extends below 30 and above 300 mg/g. Associations of uACR with advers e outcomes were present across multiple subgroups, defined by presence or absence of CKD, hypertension, and DM, and across all adult demographic subgroups that were evaluated. Additionally, it is considered standard of care to screen for albuminuria for mo st patients with hypertension or DM . The predictive strength of albuminuria was much stronger and more progressive across worsening categories than the semi- quantitative measure of proteinuria assessed by dipstick. [33] Therefore, the Work Group recommends that uACR be measured in all patients with CKD and clinicians should include the uACR for staging and classification of CKD, though there are no studies to guide the frequency of uACR measurement. As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group sys tematically reviewed the relevant evidence. [33] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is moderate. The body of evidence had some limitations, including the potential for unmeasured confounders in the analyses. [33] Other considerations regarding this recommendation included the benefits, including improved prognostication of mortality, outweighing the potential harm of adverse events, which was small. Patient values and preferences were consistent with the desire for improved prediction of adverse outcomes. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Strong for\" recommendation. Recommendation 3. In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/minute/1.73 m\u00b2, we suggest one - time cystatin C -based estimated glomerular filtration to confirm diagnosis and/or refine staging of chronic kidney disease . (Weak for | Reviewed, New -added) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 33 of 159 Discussion Many patients are diagnosed, staged, and treated for CKD on the sole basis of an eGFR derived from SCr. Creatinine has many inherent limitations that affect its sensitivity and specificity, resulting in bi-directional misclassification. The primary problem with creatinine is that the serum concentrations in part reflect its production from muscle turnover, and higher creatinine production is a marker of better overall health.[ 34] In contrast, higher creatinine levels are used to quantify reductions in eGFR, so the bias of creatinine production must be accounted for. Rather than estimating the muscle mass of an individual person, current creatinine based GFR equations derive an estimate of creatinine production based on each individual's a ge and sex, and whether or not he or she is black. The race adjustment for blacks is particularly controversial. Although blacks overall may have larger muscle mass compared with whites, there is clearly heterogeneity across the population and individuals with the highest risk of kidney disease may also be those with lower than average muscle mass. This can result in delayed diagnosis of CKD, as the GFR estimates in these individuals would be inappropriately adjusted to higher values. Furthermore, at least one population -based study found that the ratio of creatinine production in black people compared to white people is much lower than suggested by the GFR equations. [35] Therefore, an alternative measure of kidney function that is not influenced by muscle mass cou ld be appealing for patients and clinicians. Cystatin C is an alternative method for estimating kidney function that is less biased by age, sex, race and muscle mass relative to creatinine. In contrast to creatinine, cystatin C does not have bias across race/ethnic groups. Therefore, the GFR estimate based on cystatin C is more reliable across diverse populations. In a patient -level meta -analysis that included 16 studies and 93,710 individuals that compared CKD staging and prognosis using SCr versus cystatin C ,[36] a large proportion were re -classified to different CKD stages by cystatin C, and the re -classification improved risk stratification for clinically relevant outcomes at all multiple eGFR categories. For example, among persons with an eGFR of 45 -60 mL/minute/1.73 m\u00b2 as assessed by SCr, 40% were re -classified as not having CKD by cystatin C while another 25% were re - classified into worse CKD stages. On the basis of this evidence, the Work Group suggests a \"one -time\" measurement of cystatin C to confirm the diagnosis of CKD and refine the CKD stage. The role of cystatin C for the confirmation of reduced eGFR among the oldest old (80 years and older) is unclear, as it has been shown in a study outside the scope of this evidence review that the percentage of those re -classified as not having CKD is diminished at older ages. [37] Further, it is less certain whether serial measures of cystatin C would have value in comparison with serial measures of SCr, so the Work Group has limited the scope of its recommendation to the use of cystatin C for CKD staging. However, if an individual's health status changes, clinicians may choose to repeat cystatin C beyond the initial test for GFR estimation and staging because the accuracy of SCr may change with health status. The benefits of using cystatin C include avoidance of over -diagnosing CKD, the provision of more accurate classification of risk for progression and complications, and tailored treatment of comorbid conditions. Avoiding the \"false positive\" diagnosis of CKD is a high priority based on consensus within the patient focus group that a diagnosis of CKD causes distress. In addition, participants in the focus group indicated that they wanted the most accurate information possible about their diseas e status and prognosis. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 34 of 159 There may be challenges to implementing cystatin C measurement. At some hospitals, including the San Diego and San Francisco VA Health Care System (VAHCS), cystatin C is already available as a routine test; however, it is not offered in all facilities. While there would be up -front costs in implementing cystatin C measurement into local laboratories, including personnel time for local standardization, the per assay cost of cystatin C at the San Francisco VAHCS is less than $5. As some providers may not be familiar with its use , it is essential that the cystatin C laboratory result be accompanied by an e GFR, and the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD -EPI) equation for cystatin C is appropriate in these populations. [38] As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group systemat ically reviewed the relevant evidence. [36] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low. The body of evidence had some limitations, as the methods for measurement of creatinine and cystatin C varied across the studies included in the Shlipak et al. meta -analysis, as did the efforts to calibrate these measures to reference standards. There is also a risk of residual confounding from observational cohort studies. Other considerations regarding this recommendation included the benefits, including improved outcomes in CVD mortality , outweighing the potential harm of adverse events, which was small. Patient values and preferences were similar. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation . Recommendation s 4. We suggest the use of a validated risk prediction model as a clinical decision support aid in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -added) 5. When assessing the risk of progression to end- stage renal disease, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific risk prediction calculator. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New- added) Discussion The utility of CKD progression risk models lies in their promise to cost effectively risk -stratify people. Risk prediction of CKD progression could enable greater tailoring of disease modifying therapies, rational determination of frequency of follow -up, and inform timing of referral to specialty care. [39] In addition, CKD progression risk prediction modelling could enhance SDM surrounding ESRD treatment planning. A sizeable number of CKD risk prediction calculators have been developed, some focusing on predi cting the occurrence of CKD, and others on predicting the risk of CKD progression to ESRD for those with established CKD . (see Table 2 ).[39] This discussion is confined to the latter. The published CKD progression risk equations nearly universally include demographic characteristics, mea sures of eGFR or SCr , and albuminuria by other biomarkers (e.g., serum phosphate or bicarbonate) or risk conditions for progression (e.g., hypertension). [39] The most recent SR of CKD progression risk prediction equations identified eight studies describing 11 models of CKD progression.[ 40,41] Most of the models had not yet been externally validated or suffered from other statistically defined deficiencies. [40] The Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) model, developed in 2011, evaluated CKD progression risk for a large group of predominantly Caucasian North American patients with established CKD in stages 3 -5.[42] VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 35 of 159 Both its 4- variable and 8 -variable versions have been found to have excellent discrimination, good calibration, and have been externally validated, first in a Dutch cohort, and subsequently in diverse cohorts from North America, Asia, Europe, and Australasia. [41,43 ] Grams et al. (2015) compared the 4- variable KFRE ability to predict ESRD incidence by comparing its calculated one-year ESRD risk threshold to an absolute eGFR threshold.[ 44] Lower variability in time to ESRD was found using the KFRE's o ne-year ESRD risk threshold of 5% compared with an eGFR threshold alone. Although limited by its observational study design and narrow cohort characteristics (non -diabetic African -American adults under 70 years of age), the study suggests that use of the KFRE prediction tool could be more informative for clinical decision making (e.g., timing for nephrology or transplant referral and vascular access planning) than an arbitrary eGFR threshold. Additional CKD risk progression models have been proposed follow ing the KRFE. One study explored the benefit of considering a pathology score, derived from a review of diabetic kidney biopsies (\"D -Score\"), along with the Tangri KFRE to predict renal outcomes. [45] No incremental prognostic value was achieved beyond the use of the KFRE alone. A risk prediction tool for the progression of advanced CKD to ESRD was also developed by investigators in the VA. [46] This study was included in the SR by Tangri et al. (2016). [41] A 6-variable equation predi cting one -year ESRD risk was identified using an elderly, male V eteran population with CKD stage 4. The VA equation is more complex, requiring repeated blood pressures (BPs) , and the addition of comorbidities into the model as well as demographic and laboratory variables. This equation yielded excellent discrimination in both the development and validation cohorts; however, the KFRE performed nearly as well. [46] Two additional studies report alternatives to the KRFE, without head -to-head comparisons. A Taiwanese study described the use of a modified clinical diabetic nephropathy score to predict the progression of people with advanced CKD to ESRD. [47] Comprised of five items (age, systolic ), eGFR, and urine pr otein -to-creatinine ratio [uPCR]), a score of seven or more out of a maximum of nine points was associated with increased risk of dialysis initiation. While simple to use, confidence in the study findings is tempered by the study's design, sample size, and limited generalizability to the U .S. population. The slope of eGFR decline has also been compared to two measures of eGFR variability as predictors of progression of CKD stage 3 -5 to ESRD. [48] As a predictor of ESRD, the slope of eGFR decline outperformed one eGFR variability equation and underperformed relative to the other. The study suggests that changing renal function using either slope of decline or eGFR variability may enhance prediction of adverse renal outcomes. While the use of risk prediction equations in other fields has been associated with improved patient outcomes, [42] the impact of estimating progression risk on the processes of ESRD preparation, slope of eGFR decline, and transition to ESRD has not been evaluated. [39] Previously, there has been an absence of recommendations in CKD guidelines for the use of CKD progression risk prediction models, which likely explains the dearth of clinical impact analyses. [39] KDIGO clinical guidelines issued in 2012, not included in this evidence base, suggested use of a risk equation to aid in timing of renal replacement therapy ( RRT) referral. [3] More recently, the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) guideline on management of older VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 36 of 159 patients with CKD, also not included in this evidence base, endorsed use of the four -variable KFRE because of its performance, broad validation, and simplicity. [43] The feasibility of using an ESRD risk prediction tool is contingent upon the resources and capabilities of the health system in which it is deployed. Ideally it is used at po int of care. The KFRE's availability via online calculator, bedside tablet, or smart phone application make it ideal as a point -of-care decision support aid.[ 40,42] As these are Reviewed, New -added recommendations, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant bodies of evidence. [36,39,41,44-48] Overall, the benefits and harms of using a risk prediction equation were balanced. Particip ants in the patient focus group indicated that information about kidney disease may be difficult to receive and they expressed difficulty with understanding the complexity of CKD progression. On the other hand, they also expressed a desire for SDM , which necessitates patient understanding of the trajectory of their illness. Use of an ESRD progression tool may aid patients in comprehending the gradual loss of nephron function and could help allay patients' universally expressed fear of starting dialysis, as well as any initial shock concerning the diagnosis. T he similarity in expressed values and preferences by patients related to desire for better awareness and understanding of CKD and for SDM suggests that an area of future research is the use of risk predi ction equations to aid in forecasting the timeline of CKD progression , changing patient behavior, and possibly changing the rate of progression, to add balance to the unhappy news of CKD. Although the quality of the evidence pertaining to the relative uti lity of CKD progression risk prediction tools was low, it should not be construed that ESRD risk prediction equations are not useful. To the contrary, there is strong evidence that the KFRE offers excellent discrimination as a prediction equation for adver se renal outcomes in a broad range of populations. Moreover, there is considerable evidence that its key variables, eGFR and albuminuria, are predictive of renal outcomes. [41] The use of an ESRD risk prediction tool may be particularly useful to primary care providers in low health resource regions where limited subspecialty care is available, thus enabling the primary care provider to begin patient counseling related to CKD progression using quantitative as well as qualitative discussion points. The choice of ESRD risk prediction tool (e.g., KFRE, slope of eGFR decline, eGFR variability , or modified clinical diabetic nephropathy score) is discretionary according to the provider preferences and patient demographics. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation and a \"Neither for nor against\" recommendation regarding the use of a validated risk prediction model as a clinical decision support aid in the management of patients with CKD.

General Management Strategies a. Team Management and Education Recommendation 6. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend a specific threshold of risk, renal function, or proteinuria to refer patients for a nephrology evaluation and man agement of chronic kidney disease ( see Algorithm: Module C, Sidebar 8 for potential indications for nephrology consultation ). (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New- replaced) Discussion One SR [ 50] and five observational studies [ 51-55] were identified which evaluate the impact of nephrology referral on outcomes . The findings suggest that nephrology referral may be associated with slower progression of kidney function decline, decreased mortality , and improved BP control. In a study of 1,533 Vetera ns by Orlando et al. (2007), nephrology care was associated with decreased risk of the composite endpoint of death or CKD progression. [54] Chen et al. (2008) reported a significantly lower kidney function decline in CKD stage 3b ( -5.5mL/m in/year but not stage 3a ( -3mL/min/year before versus -2.3mL/min/year after referral), one year after nephrology referral. [55] In a retrospective cohort study of 42,048 patients, Lonnemann et al. (2017) demonstrated that nephrology referral at stage 3 was associated with stabilizing of renal function (75.1% versus 63%, p<0.037) but not in stage 4 (57.2% versus 46.6%, p=0.1). Additionally, there was improved mortality with nephrology referral at both CKD stage 3 and 4. [53] A meta -analysis of 40 longitudinal studies by Smart et al. (2014) showed lower mortality with early referral ( defined as referral more than 1 -6 months before dialysis initiation ) compared to late referral ( defined as referral less than 1 -6 months prior to starting dialysis). [50] In a large study of VHA clinic users (n=39,031) with concomitant DM and stage 3 -4 CKD, Tseng et al. (2008) found a lower risk of dialysis -free mortality in patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD among those who had a greater number of quarterly visits with a nephrologist. [51] Nephrology care has also been shown to be associated with improved BP control; however, Minutolo et al. (2005) did not report the impact of BP control on CKD outcomes. [52] Although a pre -specified eGFR level for referral would potentially reduce late referral of patients, no RCTs have been performed to assess the clinical impact of nephrology care at a pre -specified CKD stage or eGFR. The rate of decline of renal function is variable, so the impact of timing of nephrology referral may be difficult to ascertain. Additionally, differences in healthcare system resources related to availability of nephrology specialty care, as well as feasibility of accessing that care, make a singular referral point an unreasonable universal expectation. Finally, participants in the focus group emphasized importance of understanding patient -specific goals, priorities, values and preferences , and the use of SDM in developing treatment plans. Some patients may desire preservation of QoL over aggressive treatment or may specifically object to RRT and the increasing complexity of multiple provider care. In those instances, it may be more patient -centered t o delay referral beyond an arbitrary cut off point to align care with a well- informed patient's values and preferences. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend a specific threshold of risk, renal function , or proteinuria to refer patients for nephrology evaluation and management of CKD. However, the Work Group concurs with the 2014 CKD CPG that consultation with a nephrologist to assist in the diagnosis and VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 39 of 159 treatment of patients could be considered for the following conditions ( see Algorithm: Module C, Sidebar 8): a. eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to facilitate education and planning for RRT (dialysis or kidney transplant) b. Kidney function that is rapidly worsening without obvious cause c. Metabolic complications of CKD (e.g., anemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism) d. CKD of unclear etiology after initial work up, or known or suspected kidney condition requiring specialized care ( e.g., autosomal dominant po lycystic kidney disease [ADPKD], renal vasculitis) e. Non-diabetics wit h heavy proteinuria urine >500 uPCR or hematuria As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant evidence [ 50,53] and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2008 and 2014 CPGs. [51,52,54,55] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low due to the heterogeneity in the definitions of \"early\" and \"late\" referral and the observational nature of the studies found. Defining t he ideal timing of nephrology referral that improves patient outcomes while optimizing resource utilization and healthcare value is an important knowledge gap to fill and should be the focus of future studies. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Neither for nor against\" recommendation . Recommendation 7. We suggest interdisciplinary care (including dietitians, pharmacists, and social workers in addition to physicians and nurses) for patients with later- stage chronic kidney disease. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion The outcomes of utilizing an interdisci plinary team (IDT) to provide care to patients with CKD are not well established, and the studies identified in the evidence review had serious limitations and inconsistency with mixed results. [56-59] An SR and meta -analysis of 21 studies with a mix of cohort and RCT designs by Shi et al. (2018) i ndicated that IDTs may reduce all- cause mortality, hospitalization rates, need for dialysis initiation with a catheter, and eGFR decline. [57] IDTs demonstrated the greatest benefit in patients with late stage 4 or stage 5 CKD. [57] However, a second SR by Valentijn et al. (2018) did not reveal difference in all-cause mortality, eGFR decline, or rate of RR T with IDT care, but did demonstrate that IDTs - including dieticians, pharmacists, and social workers in addition to physicians and nurses - were associated with decreased rates of hospitalizations and improved BP control. [58] An RCT by Foglefeld et al. (2017) showed that IDT appointments with coordinated care focused on tight control of BP, glycemia, lipid control, and albuminuria in diabetic patients with CKD stage 3 -4 may slow progression to ESRD compared with usual care, bu t the study was not blinded, only enrolled 120 subjects , and had a high attrition rate. [56,57,59] Participants in the patient focus group also noted that SDM and open communication helped with adherence to treatment goals and that having assistance from an IDT in the development of individualized treatment plans, along with education about why the interventions were beneficial and augmented support in making lifestyle changes, increased their ability to adhere to their individual plans. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 40 of 159 Implications for resource use, equity with regard to availability and feasibility of IDT care, and time commitment from both patients and providers associated with IDT care must also be considered. While mixed preferenc es regarding the use of mobile or telehealth technology were noted within the focus group, younger populations may be more open to use of these modalities ; all patients felt that having these options available would be beneficial to those open to using the m. Availability of these resources may help to overcome the barriers of time, distance , and feasibility of IDT care. Additionally, the terms \"multidisciplinary\" versus \"interdisciplinary\" teams are not clearly defined in the literature; further clarification about which healthcare professionals should comprise an IDT, for which purpose or outcome an IDT is needed, and which components of IDT are most beneficial to patients (e.g., education, case management) is needed. Future research could also focus on as sessing the use of IDTs via telehealth and/or mobile technology in urban and rural areas to improve lifestyle, medication adherence, patient satisfaction, and overall comprehension. The impact of these interventions in eliminating barriers to care, such as distance, limited access to transportation, low socioeconomic resources, age, and health literacy should also be evaluated, particularly since participants expressed interest in expansion of telehealth services. As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recomme ndation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant evidence. [56-59] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low. The body of evidence had very serious limitations and serious inconsistency with mixed results. Other considerations regarding this recommendation included the benefits, including improved mortality outweighing the risk of complications with aggressive treatment. There is large variation in patients' values and preferences due to the time commitment associated with treatment. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendatio n. Recommendation 8. When providing patient education, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against a particular health education program, mode, or modality to prevent chronic kidney disease progression. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New- replaced) Discussion CKD health education supports the aim of maximizing PCC and SDM, consistent with the patient focus group findings. While the benefits of patient education and self-care are often informally recognized by both patients and clinicians, the benefits of these specific interventions can be difficult to demonstrate in a study setting. Since most clinical care will include some component of informal patient education, the Work Group reviewed studies that included formalized self-management education, e-learning, behavior modification, and nutritional education compared to usual care.[ 60-63] In 2018, Zimbudzi et al. performed an SR of eight RCTs on the effects of self-management interv entions on patients with DM and CKD. [60] primary outcomes assessed included: systolic BP, diastolic BP, eGFR and HbA1c. Secondary outcomes reviewed included self-management activity, health service utilization, QoL, medication adherence , and death. The review found that self-management interventions may improve self-care activities, systolic BP, and HbA1c. There were inconclusive results on markers of CKD VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 41 of 159 progression, QoL, mortality , and hospitalization. It was also not possible to determine which self- management strategies were more effectiv e. The authors concluded that further evidence from high quality studies is needed to better understand these impacts. An RCT by Joboshi and Oka (2017) compared a unique education program (Encourage Autonomous Self- Enrichment [EASE]) to a control group that received standardized patient education where nurses distributed leaflets and answered patients' questions over a 12-week period to determine effects on psychological outcomes (perceived self-efficacy and self-management) and physiologic outcomes (systolic BP and renal function). [61] While the study was of good quality, the effects on CKD progression and BP control were inconclusive. Significant improvement in the psychological aspects were demonstrated; however, the trial period of 12 weeks was very short. A non- randomized controlled clinical trial published by Barahimi et al. (2017) evaluated the impact of using self-care education through computer -based e- learning (virtual training) on kidney function in diabetics with eGFR <60 mL/minute/1.73 m\u00b2 in Iran. [62] The intervention group (n=39) received e-learning developed using the ADDIE (analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation) model with content identified using KDIGO in addition to usual care, while the controls (n=92) received only usual care, which consisted of face-to-face education and therapeutic interventions. The mean eGFR improved from 51.1 mL/min ute to 57.8 mL /min ute in the intervention group compared with a decline of 2.3 mL/min ute in the contr ol group. Thus e-learning in addition to usual care appeared to modestly improve, or at least prevent a decline in, eGFR compared with usual care over a six-month period. There was also a trend towards improved mean HbA1c in the intervention group with a decline from 6.7% to 6.1%, versus an increase of 0.2% in the control group. There were no statistically significant impacts on BP control, weight, waist circumference, lipid measurements , or body mass index (BMI). Of note, though the educational content was available online, the intervention group received face-to-face verbal instruction in utilization of the materials. Furthermore, the e-learning population was statistically younger (mean age of 58.1 years versus 67.5 years) and better educated (53% versus 30% having completed grade 12 and higher) compared with the control group, which may also affect health literacy. An open clustered randomized trial published by Yamagata et al. (2016) studied the effects of behavior modification in addition to standard treatment on CKD progression. [63] The study group (n=1,184) received education about lifestyle modifications at their medical appointments every three months and CKD status letters to remind them about ideal lifestyle choices and medical appointments to prevent withdrawal from treatment. Additionally, their general practitioners received patient data sheets and recommendations regarding treatment and nephrology referral. Improvement in adherence to medical appointments (rate of discontinuous clinical visits 11.5% in study group versus 16.2% in controls, p=0.01) as well as significantly higher referral and co-treatment rates (p<0.01) were seen in the intervention group. The difference in rate of CKD progression between the two groups was not statistically significant. The Work Group did not infer that these results represented behavior modification within the patient population. However, the study highlights changes to healthcare professional practice patterns that the patient focus group deemed important, specifically the importance of communication and collaboration between care providers. As this is a Revie wed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant evidence. [60-63] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low due to VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 42 of 159 study design limitations and imprecision. After considering the available evidence and risk versus benefit, the Work Group's recommendation was \"neither for nor against \" intensive education programs or a specific education modality to prevent CKD progression. Although the evidence for patient educa tion programs to improve CKD progression is not strong, there is evidence, outside of the scope of this literature review, to support the use of self-management strategies in other health conditions. Future studies should focus on the impact of patient education on CKD outcomes, feasibility, and effect of resource utilization on various healthcare systems and the most effective modality for formalized patient education. Recommendation 9. For patients who are at high risk for requiring hemodialysis/renal- replac ement and need long- term venous access, we suggest against peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines to optimize future dialysis vascular access options , while considering patient values and preferences. (Weak against | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion Mature arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) are associated with superior survival compared with arteriovenous grafts or catheters in patients on hemodialysis, and are considered the gold standard for hemodialysis vascular access. [64] Two observational studies were identified that found that peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC ) lines were associated with increased risk of failure to achieve a working AVF or graft.[ 65,66] One of these studies was a retrospective cohort of 33,918 incident hemodialysis patients in the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) registry who started hemodialysis with a central venous catheter.[ 66] They found prior PICC placement was associated with lower likelihood of a successful AVF. A second study used a case -control design with 120 patients who had no functioning AVF and 162 controls with functioning AVF. [65] Prior PICC use was associated with higher odds of inability to achieve a functioning AVF. The Work Group rated these studies as moderate quality evidence with the limitations being the observational study designs and the potential for bias and confounding. PICC lines (including PICC lines and midline catheters) are used for long- term intravenous (IV) access and may alleviate the pain of repeated venipuncture and peripheral intravenous (PIV) replacements, resulting in shorter hospitalization and potential cost savings. PICC lines may be complicated by infection and venous thromboembolism, which may lead to increased resource use and additional care following PICC line placement. Further , clinicians should consider the patient's risk of requiring future hemodialysis prior to inserting a PICC line. Estimates of ESRD risk can be made through either the proper CKD staging or through a risk equation (see Recommendations 4 and 5 ). The potential risk of failing to achieve adequate vascular access for hemodialysis must be balanced against the benefits of IV access with PICC lines. The Work Group recognizes that a patient may need long- term vascular access, and there may be instances in which no practical alternatives to a PICC line exist. However, in patients at high risk for ESRD, small- bore tunneled internal jugular catheters or ultrasound- guided PIV placement are acceptable options to avoid the risks a PICC line could pose on the success of future dialysis access . As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the evidence .[65,66] The Work Group identified t wo large observational studies that found that PICC lines were associated with increased risk of failure to achieve a working AVF or graft.[ 65,66] The Work Group's VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 43 of 159 confidence in the quality of evidence is moderate due to the limitations of the observational study designs and potential for bias and confounding. Other considerations regarding this recommendation included the harms of failure to achieve adequate hemodia lysis access outweighing the benefits of vascular access with PICC lines, especially with the availability of alternative methods (e.g., small- bore tunneled internal jugular catheters, ultrasound- guided PIV placement). Patient values were somewhat varied, as discussed above. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"W eak against\" recommendation . b. Indication for Referral to Nephrology for Renal Replacement Therapy Including Dialysis and Renal Transplant Recommendation 10. We suggest utilizing shared decision making regarding renal replacement therapy (versus conservative management) in part to improve patient satisfaction. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion As noted in the 2010 Renal Physicians Association's CPG, the clinical management and care of patie nts with CKD poses complex decisions for the patients, their families, and medical providers. [23] Several publications reviewed in t his VA/DoD CPG also acknowledge the importance and challenges of SDM in this population. SDM places patients at the center of their care process and ensures that their values and preferences are paramount in their treatment decisions. For these reasons, SDM is the ethical foundation on which ESRD management decisions are built and is accepted as the standard of care. In this VA/DoD evidence -based CPG , the Work Group sought to identify specific impacts of SDM in the care of patients with progressive CKD as reported in literature. Only two studies with very low quality evidence were identified regarding such impacts in the medical management of patients with CKD. [67,68] Both studies identified increased patient satisfaction with modality selection when patients were actively involved in the planning and decision making of their treatment options. The first study, the German Choice of Renal Replacement therapy (CORETH) project, focused on the psychosocial aspects that contribute to increased patient satisfaction in treatment choices for ESRD. The study population consisted of 780 dialysis patients across Germany who had been on either peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis for 6 to 24 months. Although a primary objective of this study was to evaluate the difference in patient satisfaction between peritoneal dialysis and in -center hemodialysis, there was also a statistically significant increase in patient satisfaction for those who were included in the process of modality choice. [67] The second study, by the European Kidney Patients' Federation (CEAPIR), retrospectively reviewed patients' perceptions of information and education for their RRT. Approximately 4,000 patients from 36 countries, who were either on hemodialysis or had a functioning transplanted kidney, were surveyed. The review found that a large majority of those surveyed considered that they had been part of the decision - making process for selecting their treatment modality, which appeared to be associated with higher levels of satisfaction with their selected treatment. [68] VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 44 of 159 As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant evidence. [67,68] The confidence in quality of the evidence was very low due to participant recall limitations in the retrospective collection of data in the CEAPIR study [68] and a limited focus on hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis and lack of randomization in the CORETH study. [67] However, the Work Group considered that the potential benefits of SDM in the care of patients with progressive kidney disease outweighed the harms/burdens. SDM with regard to CKD treatment includes ongoing commu nication and collaboration between patients, their primary care physician (PCP) and their nephrologists, which was emphasized by the patient focus group. Some barriers to this process include the varying levels of comfort among PCPs with RRT discussions an d the difficulty of maintaining ongoing communication between PCPs and nephrologists. With the normal progression of CKD, timely education in patients with progressive CKD is essential so that patients can make an informed decision about the direction of their treatment. Early referral also allows time for patients to formulate and articulate their goals of care, evaluate their options, and adequately prepare for whichever treatment option they choose (i.e., vascular access placement, transplant referral, or palliative care referral). Therefore, based on the available evidence, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation, suggesting the utilization of SDM on modality selection involving the patient, the PCP, and the nephrologist for optimal manag ement of RRT (versus conservative management) to improve patient satisfaction and achieve patient -centered goals for treatment, while noting that all benefits of SDM may not be captured in peer - reviewed literature . Recommendation s 11. In patients with high com orbidities/low functional status approaching the need for renal replacement therapy and for whom prolongation of life is the priority, we suggest evaluation for renal replacement therapy with sufficient time for comprehensive preparation. (Weak for | Revie wed, New -added) 12. In patients with high comorbidities/low functional status approaching the need for renal replacement therapy and for whom avoiding hospitalization, death in hospitals, or intensive procedures is the priority, we suggest offering conservative management over dialysis. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -added) 13. In patients with high comorbidities/low functional status approaching the need for renal replacement therapy and for whom prolongation of life may not be the priority, there is insuff icient evidence to recommend for or against dialysis to improve quality of life. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New- added) Discussion The decision to pursue renal replacement in the very elderly, frail, or medically complex CKD population is challen ging for patients and providers alike. Because of the complexity of the patient population, the role of patient preferences in treatment decisions, and ethical issues, optimally designed clinical trials comparing renal replacement versus conservative (non -renal replacement) management are not possible. The above recommendations are constructed based on review of data from one comprehensive SR, [69] two retrospective studies, [70,71] and one prospective cohort observational study. [72] Evidence from these studies demonstrated a strong survival advantage for patients electing to pursue dialysis versus VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 45 of 159 supportive care.[ 70-72] However, these benefits attenuate on covariate analyses when comorbid features and advanced age are considered. [69,72,73] Foote et al. (2016) performed a meta- analysis of 89 studies which included 294,921 patients with ESRD ranging in age from 60.5 to 92 years of age, examining a primary outcome of survival/mortality. [69] Ther e was significant heterogeneity in study design and outcomes within the data pool, and no RCTs comparing dialysis versus supportive care could be identified in this population. Time intervals of one year (84.2% versus 72.7%), two years (62.2% versus 44.4%) , and five years (34.5% versus 8.5%) all identified a strong survival benefit for dialysis over supportive care. However, p -values were not reported, and the data remain inconclusive. Several studies in this meta- analysis examined factors associated with benefit from dialysis, noting that high comorbidity, impaired functional status, and age over 80 years were associated with loss of survival benefit. [69] Based on this evidence , persistent uncertainty regarding survival benefit in this population, and the need for individualized management, the Work Group suggests that patients in this population, whose first priority is duration of life, be referred to nephrology for evaluation for dialysis. Recognizing the complexity, nuances, and logistics of preparing this patient population for dialysis, patients should optimally be referred with adequate time for clinical evaluation, patient education, SDM , and dialysis preparation. Dialysis preparation typically includes modality selection, access planning, placement and maturation, and hepatitis B vaccination. Initial n ephrology referral at the time of dialysis initiation is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. [50,53] In the experience of the Work Group, up to a year may be required to adequately address these issues , recognizing that it is not possible to accurately predict when patients are likely to require dialysis . When consistent with the patient's goals of care, nephrology consultation for eGFR below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2, as discussed elsewhere in th is guideline ( see Algorithm: Module C, Sidebar 8 ), supports this process and allows for co -management of CKD complications that may also postpone the need for dialysis. [69] Comparative analyses for hospital utilization and end -of-life care outcomes are available for elderly patients electing to pursue dialysis. Tam -Tham et al. (2018) conducted a retrospective cohort study of 838 ESRD patients in Canada between 2002 and 2012. [71] Patients aged 65 or over with an eGFR below 10 mL/min ute were divided into dialysis treatment versus no dialysis treatment cohorts. A survival benefit of up to three years was identified in the dialysis population. However these patients also experienced a 40% increased risk of hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16- 1.69). Within the U.S. Veteran population, Wong et al. (2018) conducted a retrospective coh ort study of end -of-life care characteristics in 14,701 VA patients with an eGFR below 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, identified between 2000 and 2009, and who died during that same time period. [70] Patients who elected not to pursue di alysis had significantly lower rates of hospital admission (odds ratio [OR]: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.34- 0.46), intensive procedures defined and 0.15; 95% CI: 95% 0.74- 0.82). The use of palliative and hospice services were significantly increased in the non- dialysis Significantly days, and longer duration of hospice and palliative care services were also noted in this cohort. Based on this evidence, a conservative or symptom -driven approach to ESRD management may better match the goals of care fo r patients who prioritize the avoidance of aggressive medical treatment when compared with dialysis. This retrospective study VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 46 of 159 examined the utilization of medical services at the end of life in this relevant population. However, specific QoL indicators were not included or available for study. There is a paucity of published data comparing formal QoL indicators between elderly populations who choose to pursue non- dialytic supportive care and those on dialysis. A prospective observational study of 467 patient s compared QoL as assessed by 36- Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) between patients with CKD 4 and 5 attending a pre -dialysis clinic versus those enrolled in a renal supportive care clinic. [72] At time of enrollment, patients in the renal supportive care clinic were significantly older compared with the pre - dialysis clinic patients and reported lower SF -36 physica l composite scores. While there was statistically significant survival in the pre -dialysis clinic cohort, there was no significant difference in the changes in QoL and symptoms indices between these two groups, with response rates to the voluntary QoL inst ruments of around 50% in each group. The Work Group found the evidence on this topic had significant limitations. Limited -to-no ability to randomize patients, as well as difficulty with balancing cohorts in treatment arms, present challenges to conducting randomized and/or other controlled trials. Further, the body of evidence is limited by variability between comparator groups, observational data, lead time bias (i.e., apparent survival advantage related to early treatment, rather than true benefit of treatment), as well as cultural and socioeconomic factors. Differences in baseline characteristics between patients electing to pursue dialysis versus supportive care (i.e., confounding by indication in which survival benefit of dialysis versus conservative management arises due to healthier patients choosing dialysis over supportive care) may also limit applicability across study populations. There is significant variability in patient and provider preferences regarding RRT in the frail and elderly populations. Other considerations regarding these recommendations included respect for patient autonomy in the decision to pursue or decline life -sustaining treatment with dialysis, the potential harms to patient independence and QoL with pursuit of dialysis, and the wide variation in patient values and preferences. Potential survival benefits of dialysis must be balanced against risks for more intensive medical care [ 69-71] death in hospital, [70] and loss of functional capability and independence , all of which may impact patient QoL .[74] One study suggested that 61% of patients in one study regretted the initiation of dialysis, particularly when decisions were made according to provider and family preferences rather than their own, highlighting the importance of SDM to this setting. [70] Provider understanding of patient -specific goals, priorities, values, preferences, and the value of SDM w ere also recognized as theme s from the focus group, which included several participants over the age of 80. The Work Group suggests utilizing SDM regarding RRT (versus conservative management) to improve patient satisfaction (see Recommendation 10 for further discussion of evidence). Particularly in frail and elderly patients, where survival benefit is less clear, the decision to pursue dialytic therapy should not be assumed to be a foregone co nclusion; instead, goals of care must be individualized to the preferences, values, and capabilities of the patient and their caregivers .[23] Referring providers and nephrologists should also thoughtfully consider the patient's frame of mind, mood, and capability to make complex decisions (including extent of any cognitive impairment), when pursuing goals of care discussions .[67,68] In situations where providers, patients, and caregivers are undecided regarding whether or not dialysis will be beneficial, a time -limited trial of RRT followed by re -engagement of the patient and caregivers in an SDM discussion may be appropriate. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 47 of 159 There is emerging interest in the concept of \"palliative dialysis ,\" that is the provision of dialytic therapy with the intention of easing symptoms of ESRD while prioritizing QoL over longevity and traditional treatment benchmarks . When commensurate with the patient's goals of care, t his approach can include reducing the treatment time or frequency of dialysis, as well as relaxation of targets for dialysis adequacy and metabolic control of metabolic derangements . While this approach demonstrates high respect for patient autonomy, specific indications, benefits , the infrastructure to support its use, and its advantages have not yet been developed in the U.S. [75] For example, there is currently no mechanism to separate quality and outcomes data from palliative dialysis patients from standard care in the assessment of dialysis unit quality benchmarks. Consequently, this approach to therapy is not universally available at this time and may benefit from further study and development of policy to support it . As the se are Reviewed, New -added recommendations, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant evidence. [50,53,67-74] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low to very low. The body of evidence is limited by variability across comparator groups, observational data, lead time bias, as well as cultural and socioeconomic factors. Thus, the Work Group decided upon two \"Weak for\" recommendations and one \"Neither for nor against\" recommendation. For additional considerations in the management of elderly patients with CKD, see Appendix J . C. Non -pharmacologic Management of CKD a. Nutrition Recommendation 14. We suggest the use of dietary sodium restriction as a self- management strategy to reduce proteinuria and improve blood pressure control in patients with chronic kidney disease. (Weak for | Not r eviewed, Not -changed) Discussion Dietary sodium restriction has been found to reduce proteinuria and improve BP control in patients with CKD. [76-78] McMahon et al. (2013) found significantly lower proteinuria levels and reductions in BP in patients with CKD on a low sodium diet (60 -80 mmol/day or 1380- 1840 mg/day) versus a higher sodium diet. [77] de Brito -Ashurst et al. (2013) found that patients with CKD receiving a tailored low sodium diet had a significantly greater reduction in systolic BP than those receiving low sodium diet advice alone. [76] Slagman et al. (2011) found significantly larger proteinuria reductions in patients on a low sodium diet (50 combination angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)/ACEI therapy and a regular sodium diet (200 mmol/day or 4600 mg/day). Additionally, a greater level of proteinuria reduction was seen in patients on a low sodium diet plus combination ARB/ACEI; however, this was not significantly larger than the reduction achieved with the low sodium diet plus ACEI therapy alone. [78] Despite general consistency in the evidence supporting a dietary sodium restriction for patients, the degree of sodium restriction required is controversial. While Slagman et al. (2011) studied patients who restricted their sodium to 50 mmol/day (1150 mg/day) and McMahon et al. (2013) examined 60 -80 mmol/day (1380- 1840 mg/day), it is likely that a more liberal restriction would be just as beneficial and more realistic for patients to follow. [77,78] A sodium intake of 90 -100 mmol (2070- 2300 mg/day) is VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 48 of 159 generally accepted and consistent with the NKF 's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines. [2] Patient acceptance of and compliance with a low sodium diet varies. Providers should consider referring patients to registered dietitians (RD) for further dietary counseling, as patients in the focus group who had seen an RD perceived that it helped them a dhere to their nutrition plan. A patient's mental health, socioeconomic status, and access to food should also be considered when gauging their ability to adhere to dietary recommendations. It may be beneficial to have a mental health professional and/or s ocial worker involved if concerns in these areas are identified. As this is a Not reviewed, Not c hanged recommendation, the Work Group did not conduct an updated evidence review, but reviewed the evidence identified in the 2014 CPG. [76-78] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is moderate. The three RCTs that compared dietary sodium restriction to other interventions (diet or medication) were limited by baseline imbalances in important patient characteristics and lack of an appropriate control group. [76-78] Blinding of dietary interventions was not feasible. Other considerations regarding this recommendation included the benefits, such as reduction in proteinuria and improvement in BP control, outweighing the potential harms, which were small. Thus, the Work Group decided to carry forward a \"Weak for\" recommendation . Recommendation 15. In selected patients with stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease, we suggest offering a dietary protein intake of 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg/day as it may slow the decline in estimated glomerul ar filtration rate and progression to end- stage renal disease. (Weak for | Not r eviewed, Amended) Discussion Dietary protein restriction has been shown to slow the decline in GFR and the progression to ESRD, potentially by reducing intraglomerular pressure and reducing metabolic acidosis. [79,80] Nezu et al. (2013) found that patients who limited their protein intake to 0.6 -0.8 g protein/kg body weight had significantly higher GFRs than patients consuming higher amounts of protein. [79] This was consistent among patients with CKD, both with and without diabetic nephropathy. Additionally, Fouque and Laville (2009) found that a low protein diet of 0.6 g/kg/day resulted in a significant reduction of all-cause mortality and longer time to initiation of dialysis. [80] This was consi stent among patients with CKD both with and without diabetic nephropathy. Despite evidence supporting a dietary protein restriction to slow the progression of kidney disease, this intervention may increase the risk for calorie malnutrition if patients are not educated and monitored appropriately. Patients with CKD are at risk for malnutrition and protein restriction without adequate calorie intake can exacerbate this. [80] These risks may be compounded in patients with significant proteinuria. Patients may vary greatly in their willingness to follow a dietary protein restriction, as well as their ability to maintain it. Pat ients in the focus group who had seen an RD reported that dietary counseling helped them adhere to their nutrition plan; however, others did not understand how to limit protein intake, so referral to an RD for dietary counseling should be considered. The R D should consider fluid status and weight status when determining protein needs. Patients from backgrounds where large VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 49 of 159 protein intake is part of the culture as well as individuals with food insecurity and restricted dietary choices may find it difficult to restrict their protein intake. These patients may particularly benefit from referral to psychologists, social workers, and RDs to assist with behavior modification, access to resources to assist with food security, as well as education on healthier dietary options, respectively. Future research should explore the benefits of plant -based versus animal- based proteins in patients with CKD. As this is a N ot reviewed, Amended recommendation, t he Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation, but reviewed evidence from the 2014 CPG. [79,80] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low due to lack of information regarding blinding and unclear allocation concealment and intention -to-treat (ITT) analyses. The Work Group judged that the potential benefits of a modestly slower decline in GFR and longer time to initiate dialysis may slightly outweigh the potential harms, including malnutrition. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation . D. Pharmacologic Management of CKD and Associated Conditions a. Diabetes Medications Recommendation 16. We suggest offeri ng metformin as a first -line therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients with stage 1 to 3 chronic kidney disease to reduce all- cause mortality. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion Metformin is recommended in the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care (VA/DoD DM CPG) a as a first -line agent. In the 2014 version of this guideline, CKD, based on the level of SCr, was documented as a contraindication for use of metformin due to concern about metformin -associated lactic acidosis. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revised its warnings on the use of metformin in mild -to-moderate renal impairment based on eGFR in April 2016 after a review of the medical literature on the safety of metformin in patients with CKD. [81] The evidence review conducted for the update of this guideline identified a single meta -analysis that included 17 observational studies, only six of which assessed the use of metformin in patients with CKD and type 2 DM . Although the quality of the evidence was low, metformin use was associated with a statistically significant decrease in all- cause mortality compared to treatment regimens that did not include metformin. [82] Acco rding to one observational study in the meta -analysis, there was a statistically significant reduction in hypoglycemic episodes in patients treated with metformin monotherapy compared to insulin monotherapy. Since metformin is an oral agent available as a generic, it is more acceptable to patients and providers to initiate or continue due to cost, convenience, and ease of use, compared to injectable insulin. The Work Group determined that the benefits of treatment with metformin outweigh the potential harms in patients with CKD and an eGFR >30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2. Though lactic acidosis is a worrying side effect for patients and providers, the most common side effects associated with metformin use are gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort and diarrhea. a See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care. Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/cd/diabetes/index.asp VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 50 of 159 There are no specific recommendations in this CPG for adjusting dosages based on the eGFR, but the FDA provided the following guidance. [83] Metformin is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL /minute/1.73 m2) and metformin initiation is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 and 45 mL /minute/1.73 m2. However, metformin use may be used at standard doses in patients with eGFR >45 mL /minute/1.73 m2, and may be continued at eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 after consideration of the individual patient's risks and the benefits of treatment. In addition, the FDA recommends holding metformin at the time of or prior to iodinated contrast imaging procedures in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL /minute/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast, because a contrast -associated acute kidney injury ( CA-AKI) may increase the risk of a lactic acidosis with metformin use. Metformin can then be resumed if renal function is stable 48 hours after the imaging procedure or when renal function has recovered. [83] As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant evidence. [82] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low due to the observational study design. Additional considerations include the availability of metformin as a generic and as an oral agent, both of which are preferred by patients and providers. Given the available evidence demonstrating decrease in mortality, the Work Group suggests offering metformin as a first -line therapy for the treatment of type 2 DM in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD. The change in FDA guidance regarding metformin use in patients with CKD supports this recommendation. Additional research is needed to determine appropriate dosages of metformin, specifically looking at the incidence of adverse events in those with increasing renal impairment. See Appendix K for additional information on the potential concerns of metformin in patients with CKD. Recommendation 17. We recommend offering sodium -glucose co -transporter 2 inhibitors as an option for add -on therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients with stage 1 to 3 chronic kidney dise ase to reduce chronic kidney disease progression and the risk of cardiovascular events. (Strong for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion For the purposes of this CPG, \"add- on therapy\" refers to the use of all other DM medications in addition to the use of metformin (in patients for whom metformin is not contraindicated) for the treatment of type 2 DM in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD. While metformin should be considered a first -line therapy for the treatment of type 2 DM in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD (see Recommendation 16 ), there are no data that metformin has any salutary benefit regarding the prog ression of CKD , whereas sodium -glucose cotransporter inhibitors do slow the progression of CKD. [84] T here are no studies comparing outcomes with metformin to those with SGLT2 inhib itors alone. The evidence review identified two SRs evaluating SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with both CKD and DM. [84,85] A meta -analysis of -controlled t rials (n=34,322) performed by Zelniker et al. (2019) showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with decreased risk of CKD progression (composite of worsening renal function, ESRD, and renal death) in all groups stratified by CKD stage, but the effect wa s higher at increasing levels of renal function (33% risk reduction with baseline eGFR <60 mL /minute/1.73 m 2, 44% risk reduction in group VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 51 of 159 with eGFR 60 -90 mL/minute/1.73 m2, and 56% risk reduction for those with eGFR >90 mL/minute/1.73 m2).[84] This decreasing effectiveness in more advanced disease may support consideration of SGLT2 inhibitor use earlier in disease. Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with decreased hospitalization for heart failure regardless of prior history of atherosclerotic CVD ( ASCVD ) or heart failure in all subgroups. However, the effect also appeared to correlate with decreasing renal function (40% reduction if baseline eGFR <60 mL /minute/1.73 m2, 31% in group -90 mL/minute/1.73 m2, and a nonsignificant 12% risk reduction for those with eGFR >90 mL/minute/1.73 m2). The authors hypothesized that natriuresis induced by the SGLT2 inhibitors might explain the effect on heart failure. The SGLT2 inhibitors' risk reduction for major cardiovascular ( CV) events was statistically significant in patients with eGFR <60 mL/minute/1.73 m 2, but not in patients with eGFR >60 mL/minute/1.73 m2, and risk reduction was only noted in those with known ASCVD. Although SGLT2 inhibitors also decreased all -cause mortality by 15%, there was significant heterogeneity between groups. [84] The earlier and smaller SR by Lo et al. (2018) included nine studies comparing S GLT2 inhibitors with placebo (n=1 ,092). [85] In their analysis, SGLT2 inhibitors showed improvement in uACR , heart failure and BP. SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with an increase in SCr. However, closer review of data revealed that the average increase in SCr was 0.04 mg/dL, which the Work Group judged to be not clinically significant. Additionally, the follow -up period for the included studies was weeks, and change in renal function may be explained by mild volume depletion induced by osmotic diuresis. There was no significant difference in mortality and other major adverse CV events (MACE). There was also no difference in discontinuation due to adverse events in SGLT2 inhibitors, which were associated with a 2.5 -fold increase in genital infections compared to placebo .[85] Further data from the Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy (CREDENCE) trial, published after the end of the SR , demonstrated participants with a uACR > 300 and an eGFR of 30 -90 mL/minute/1.73 m2, randomly assigned to canagliflozin experienced a 30% reduction in a composite outcome of the risk of ESRD, doubling of SCr, or renal or CVD mortality , compared with participants assigned to placebo .[86] As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant studies identified in the evidence review. [84,85] The strength of this recommendation is based primarily on moderate -to-high quality evidence presented by the Zelniker et al. SR and meta -analysis. Compared to the low -quality evidence found by Lo et al., Zel niker et al. included a larger number of patients (tens of thousands versus hundreds), a longer study period (years versus weeks to months), and more complete outcome data. [84,85] Due to the SR and meta -analysis by Zelniker et al. and the significant risk reduction for the critical outcome of decreased CKD progression and CV morbidity markedly outweighing the harms, including risk of side effects (e.g., genital infections), the W ork Group decided upon a \"Strong for\" recommendation . Recommendation 18. (glucagon peptide -1 receptor agonists) as an option for add- on therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients with chronic kidney disease to reduce chronic kidney disease progression. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -added) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 52 of 159 Discussion Evidence on the use of GLP -1 receptor agonists was limited to two studies with moderate -to-high quality evidence. [87,88] In a post hoc subgroup analysis of the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial, liraglutide was found to reduce the risk of all- cause mortality and MACE compared to placebo in patients with eGFR <60 mL/minute/1.73 m2.[87] In addition, liraglutide reduced the in patients with albuminuria ( uACR >30 mg/g). In the Dulaglutide Versus Insulin Glargine in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Moderate -to-Severe Chronic Kidney Disease (AWARD -7) trial, dulaglutide was found to significantly reduce the decline of eGFR in patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD, but had no significant effect on ESRD or kidney transplant. [88] There was also no significant difference in all- cause or CV mortality, but this study was not designed to assess mortality and MACE outcomes. Both of these studies showed no significant difference in adverse events in comparison with the control groups. [87,88] In weighing the options for management of DM in the CKD population, GLP -1 agonists would not be considered first line. As noted above (see Reco mmendation 16 ), there is strong evidence for the reduction of all- cause mortality with metformin and emerging evidence for the renoprotective benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors. Thus, the Work Group sugge sts offering liraglutide or dulaglutide as adjuncts to m etformin or as alternative s to SGLT2 inhibitors. Some GLP -1 agonists (e.g., dulaglutide) may be dosed weekly, which may be of value for patients. However, the cost and need for injection to administer could decrease the desirability for some patients. GLP -1 agonists are contraindicated in patients at increased risk for thyroid tumors, but the low overall risk of adverse effects and the potential for weight loss make GLP -1 agonists an attractive option. In regards to s emaglutide, two articles, Semaglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN -6) [89] and Oral Semaglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (PIONEER-6 ) [90] did not meet the criteria for inclusion. These studies showed favorable trends with the use of a GLP -1 agonist, but the target population was patients with DM. With no subgroup analysis and less than a quarter of the patients having CKD, these could not be used in supporting this recommendation . As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant studies identified in the evidence review. [87,88] The systematic evidence review did not identify studies using other GLP -1 agonists that met the criteria for inclusion, so it is uncertain whether other GLP -1 agonists would have the observed benefits. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is moderate for the outcome of mortality and high for the outcomes of myocardial infarction ( MI), stroke, change in eGFR, and serious adverse events. Ot her considerations include the benefits of improved mortality and eGFR, outweighing the potential harm of adverse events, which were small. Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied as GLP -1s are delivered subcutaneously. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation. Future research should examine other GLP -1 agonists in order to assess potential class effects, and assess the long -term effects on renal function and kidney outcomes in patients with CKD . VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 53 of 159 Recommendation 19. In patients w ith chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of thiazolidinediones or dipeptidyl peptidase -4 inhibitors to decrease progression of chronic kidney disease or mortality. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion The systematic evidence review for this CPG update identified two SRs related to the use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP -4) inhibitors (also known as \"gliptins\") [91,92] and one retrospective cohort study on the use of thiazolidinediones (TZD). [93] In a pooled analysis by Perl et al. (2016) of nine RCTs comparing saxagliptin to placebo, there was no statistically significant change in eGFR or hypoglycemia based on very low quality evidence. [92] A second SR by McGill et al. (2015) examined another DPP -4 inhibitor, linagliptin, versus placebo in a post hoc subgroup analysis of two RCTs and found no significant difference in cardiac failure, congestive heart failure, left ventricular failure, or other serious adverse events based on low quality evidence. [91] A retrospective cohort study by Chen et al. (2015) on TZD use showed lower mortality and decreased need for long -term dialysis with TZDs. However, the study was of very low quality due to lack of randomization and blinding in the study design. [93] As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant evidence. [91-93] Given the low to very low quality of available literature, there was insufficient evidence for the Work Group to recommend for or against the use of either DPP -4 inhibitors or TZD in patients with DM and CKD to improve long- term kidney outcomes or mortality benefit. Additional research is needed in these areas. b. Hypertension Medications Recommendation 20. We suggest intensive blood pressure management (insufficient evidence to recommend a specific target) beyond a target of less than 140/90 mmHg, to reduce mortality in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL /minute/1.73 m\u00b2. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion Based on the evidence review for the 2019 CKD CPG, treatment to a more intensive BP target has been reported to reduce mortality in patients with CKD, a critical outcome for this CPG update. [94-96] Additional evidence is available since the 2014 CKD CPG regarding patients with hypertension, as well as those with CKD. The evidence review for this CKD CPG update focused on the question of optimal BP goals in patients with CKD and consisted of two SRs, [94,97] one subgroup analysis of a multicenter RCT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial [SPRINT]), [95] and extensions of two prospective cohort studies ( African American Study of Kidne y Disease [ AASK ] with a follow -up of 14.4 years [ 98] and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] trials with a follow -up of 19.3 years [ 96]), that compared treatment to more intensive or lower BP goals versus standard or usual BP targets. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 54 of 159 The literature review for the 2014 CKD CPG included one SR that addressed the question of targeting low versus usual or standard BP goals. [99] The three trials included in the SR were the MDRD trial (n=840), the AASK trial (n=1,094), and the Blood -Pressure Control for Renoprotection in Patients with Non -Diabetic Chronic Renal Disease (REIN- 2) trial (n=33 8), which randomized non- diabetic adults with stage 3 to 4 CKD with or without proteinuria to two BP targets (lower [125/75 mmHg to 130/80 mmHg] versus higher [<140/90 mmHg] with a median follow -up of 1.6 to 3.8 years). Based on this earlier meta- analysis, a low BP target of <125/75 mmHg to 130/80 mmHg was not significantly associated with reduction in kidney function decline, risk of CV mortality , or all- cause mortality compared to a BP target of <140/90 mmHg. Additionally, lower targets were associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes such as hypotension, increased risk of falling (particularly in the elderly), pre -renal azotemia, electroly te disturbances, drug -drug interaction, as well as increased pill burden and difficulty with adherence. [99] Based on that set of studies, the 2014 CKD CPG Work Group suggested against lowering BP to a target of less than 130/80 mmHg in patients with CKD stages 1 to 4, even in the presence of proteinuria. Although there was a signal for benefit in two of the trials based on post hoc subgroup analyses, the Work Group cited concerns about increased risk of adverse outcomes and resource burdens for the patient due to the need for more frequent visits and monitoring. [99] For the 2019 CKD CPG evidence review, several studies evaluated risk of CKD progression to ESRD and markers of CKD progression, a critical outcome for this guideline. Similar to the evidence reviewed in the 2014 CKD CPG to determine the optimal BP goal in patients with CKD, treatment to more intensive BP goals did not demonstrate a benefit in reducing kidney function decline. In an SR and meta -analysis of nine trials in patients with non- diabetic CKD (n=5,316), there was no statistically significant difference in the annual rate of change in GFR, doubling of SCr level or 50% reduction in GFR, incidence of ESRD, or composite renal outcomes between patients treated to more intensive targets compared to standard BP targets.[ 97] In a subgroup analysis of patients with CKD in SPRINT, Cheung et al. (2017) found no statistically significant difference in the composite of 50% decrease in eGFR from baseline or ESRD. However, it was noted that patients in the intensive treatment group were at an increased risk of a > 30% decline in eGFR compared to the standard treatment group. This decline was thought to be due to an acute hemodynamic effect of treatment, as the rate of change in eGFR did not differ between treatment groups after six months follow -up.[95] The long -term extension stu dies for AASK [98] and MDRD [96] found no statistically significant between -group differences in risk of CKD progression to ESRD. Additional research is needed to determine whether patients with CKD and significant proteinuria may benefit from treatment to a more intensive BP goal to prevent decline in kidney function. Evidence regarding the effect of BP control on mortality was variable. Results from a subgroup analysis of 2,646 SPRINT participants with CKD (66% with baseline eGFR > 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2) demonstrated a 28% lower rate of all- cause mortality in patients randomized to more intensive systolic BP target of <120 mmHg (n=1,330) compared to those in the standard BP target of <140 mmHg (n=1,316) treatment group. [95] Achieved systolic BP/diastolic BP was approximately 123/66 mmHg with more intensive treatment compared to 135/72 mmHg in the standard treatment group; not surprisingly, the intensive group was prescribed more antihypertensive agents (mean 2.9 versus 2.0). It is important to note that patients with DM , proteinuria >1 g/d and orthostatic hypotension were excluded from the study, and the mean age of the subgroup was approximately 72 years of age (44% > 75 years).[ 95] An SR by Malhotra et al. (2017), with evidence rated as high for the critical outcome of mortality, included 18 RCTs comparing VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 55 of 159 intensive BP control to standard BP control (variable targets, five st udies did not have defined BP targets) in 15,924 patients, including 1,094 patients from SPRINT, aged 18 to 80 years with stage 3 to 5 CKD with mean follow -up of 3.6 years.[ 94] The mean baseline systolic BP was 148 mmHg, with a decrease to 132 mmHg in the intensive treatment group and to 140 mmHg in the less intensive treatment group. Treatment to more intensive BP targets significantly reduced mortality regardless of CKD severity; however, there was no significant difference when only those studies with defined BP targets were included (evidence rated as moderate). [94] The SR and meta -analysis by Tsai et al. (2017) included 8,127 patients with non- diabetic CKD (median age 55 years) from nine RCTs and found no statistically significant difference in mortality between more intensive and standard BP targets (with or without defined BP targets). Th e evidence from this SR was rated as low for the critical outcome of mortality. [97] The long - term observational extension of the MDRD trial found that intensive BP lowering (mean arterial pressure [MAP] <92 mmHg; equivalent to approximately <125/75 mmHg) significantly reduced mortality compared to a standard target (MAP <107 mmHg; ap proximately <140/90 mmHg).[ 96] In addition, the long- term follow -up of the AASK trial reported a significant difference in the risk of mortality (adjusted analysis) between strict (MAP 92 mmHg) compared to usual (MAP 102 -107 mm Hg; approximately 135/85 to 140/90 mmHg) BP targets. [98] The Work Group sought data on the risk of side effects associated with antihypertensive use, with electrolyte imbalances as a critical outcome. In the SPRINT subgroup analysis by Cheung et al. (2017 ), the incidence of hypotension was higher in the intensive treatment group (1.2%) compared to standard treatment (0.9%), a difference that was not statistically significant (p=0.17). [95] There was also no significant differences in bradycardia or injurious falls. There was a statistically significant increased risk of hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive treatment group compared to the standard target group. However, the strength of evidence was low due to serious limitations and imprecision in the data. [95] Although reports of AKI were higher in the intensive tr eatment group, a review of serious adverse events (not included as part of the evidence review for this CPG) reported as AKI resulting in or occurring during hospitalization or emergency department visits in patients in SPRINT noted that most cases of AKI were mild and resulted in complete recovery of kidney function. [100] As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant evidence. [94-99] Though there does not appear to be a benefit with regard to progression of CKD, treatment to more intensive BP targets may reduce mortality in patients with CKD . However , confidence in the overall quality of the evidence was low. The Work Group also noted potential subgroup considerations when considering the evidence for a benefit on mortality. For example, patients with DM , 1 g/day or more proteinuria, and medical condi tions that may limit life expectancy to less than three years were excluded from SPRINT; [95] however, the meta -analysis of 18 trials by Malhotra et al. (2017), that also included data from SPRINT, reported that the benefit of more intensive treatment on mortality was consistent across several subgroups, including whether or not the patient had DM.[ 94] Therefore, given the studies evaluating different patient populations as well as different BP targets, it is not possible to make a recommendation for a specific BP target for all patients with CKD. Providers may refer to the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Hypertension in Primary Care (VA/DoD Hypertension CPG) b for further discussion of BP targets. The Work Group suggests that a lower BP target (e.g., 120 to b See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Hypertension in Primary Care. Available at : http://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/cd/htn/index.asp VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 56 of 159 130/<80 mmHg) as opposed to the previ ous BP goal of less than 140/90 mmHg could be considered for reducing mortality in patients with CKD, taking into consideration risk versus benefit on an individual basis, and after discussion of the treatment plan with the patient. The decision to treat to a lower BP goal should respect patient preferences and capabilities, including the need for additional medications, which may affect adherence to the medication regimen, as well as the risk of adverse effects, which may require additional monitoring. Thu s, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation. Recommendation 21. In patients with non- diabetic chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and albuminuria, we recommend the use of an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor to prevent progression of chronic kidney disease. Angiotensin II receptor blockers may be substituted for patients with an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor -induced cough. (Strong for | Not reviewed, Not c hanged) 22. In patients with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria, we recommend the use of an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blockers to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease, unless there is documentation of intolerance. (Strong for | Not r eviewed, Amended) 23. We recommend against the use of combination renin- angiotensin- aldosterone system blockade (an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor II receptor blocker, or an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker with a direct renin inhibitor) in patients with chronic kidney disease. (Strong against | Not r eviewed, Not c hanged) Discussion These recommendations are carried forward from the 2014 CKD CPG without an updated review of the evidence. The supporting evidence to recommend an ACEI (or ARB if unable to tolerate an ACEI) in patients with non- diabetic CKD, hypertension, and albuminuria, [ 101- 113] and an ACEI or ARB in patients with CKD, DM, hypertension, and albuminuria are dated before 2008. [114-120] The evidence to recommend against the use of combination of an ACEI and ARB, or an ACEI or ARB with a direct renin inhibitor are dated prior to 2014. [121-125] The data for the use of ARBs in patients with non- diabetic CKD are primarily based on evidence from surrogate outcomes as reviewed in the 2008 CKD CPG. The recommendation for use of an ACEI or ARB as the initial regimen is based primarily on their beneficial effects on kidney outcomes and significant benefit to slow CKD progression. Results from Nakamura et al. (2010), which were part of the evidence review for the 2014 CKD CPG, showed that ACEIs or ARBs are equally effective in controllin g BP in CKD ,[126] but the data are limited regarding CV benefits of ACEIs or ARBs compared to other antihypertensive agents in patients with CKD. An SR included in the 2008 CKD CPG showed that treatment with an ACEI reduces the risk for ESRD by 31%, with a 30% reduction in the composite outcome of doubling SCr and ESRD compared to treatment without an ACEI. [105] The REIN -2 and the AASK tria ls demonstrate that ACEI therapy slows the progression of non- diabetic CKD in patients with proteinuria. Both trials were also reviewed as part of the evidence for BP target recommendations in the 2014 CKD CPG. [103, 104,107- 110] The evidence that ARBs or ACEIs slow the progression of CKD in VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 57 of 159 patients with CKD and DM with albuminuria is primarily based on the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT), [118] the Reduction of Antagonist Group. [117] Both IDNT and RENAAL demonstrated a reduction in the primary endpoint of composite all- cause mortality, doubling of SCr, and ESRD with an ARB compared to placebo, and in I DNT also compared to a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), in patients with type 2 DM and nephropathy. [115, 118] In addition, an ACEI has been reported to be beneficial in patients with type 1 DM with albuminuria to reduce the combined risk of death, dialysis , or transplantation. [117] Regarding the selection of second- or third -line agents for antihypertensive therapy in patients with CKD, there are limited data available to guide the clinician. Two small RCTs that were part of the evidence review for the 2014 CKD CPG showed that a dihydropyridine CCB was as efficacious as an ACEI in controlling BP, [127] as was a loop diuretic compared to an antihypertensive control group. The decision for the use of these or other antihypertensive classes should be considered based on the potential for CV benefit and the patient's comorbidities and preference. Refer to the VA/DoD Hypertension CPG c for more complete information on the safety of all antihypertensive agents, and stepwise, seque ntial, and combination therapy. Further research on comparative benefits of the different antihypertensive agents for long -term CV and kidney outcomes in patients with CKD are needed. Use of ACEIs or ARBs will commonly increase SCr (up to 30% within the first two weeks after initiation) and potassium, so patients with CKD on renin- angiotensin- aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors require monitoring of potassium and SCr for safety reasons. [128] It is unclear whether treatment with an ARB would be an appropriate alternative in patients who develop hyperkalemia on an ACEI. One study that was not part of the evidence review reported that the change in serum potassium was not significantly different in patients with mild kidney impairment on an ACEI compared to an ARB; in patients with moderate kidney dysfunction, there was an increase in potassium of 0.28 mEq/L above baseline (4.6 mEq/L) with the ACEI compared to an increase in potassium of 0.12 mEq/L seen with the ARB, but the difference was not st atistically significant. [129] If potassium becomes elevated, measu res to reduce hyperkalemia that may be considered include reduction in dose of ACEI or ARB, discontinuation of concomitant medications that may increase potassium, implementation of a low potassium diet, addition of a diuretic or consideration of a potassium binder, if appropriate. If efforts to control hyperkalemia are not effective, the option of discontinuing treatment with the ACEI or ARB may be considered after discussing the risk versus benefits and preferences with the patient. While it is common fo r patients with ACEI -induced cough to be switched to an ARB, it is unknown if an ARB can be safely used as an alternative in patients who have previously developed angioedema on an ACEI. In an SR of patients with prior angioedema associated with an ACEI, t he risk of angioedema on subsequent treatment with an ARB was 9.4% for cases described as possible per the reports, and 3.5% for confirmed cases. [130] Another review estimated that the risk of cross -reactivity of angioedema with an ARB ranged from less than 7% to 17% in patients who previously experienced angioedema with an ACEI. [131] c See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Hypertension in Primary Care. Available at: http://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/cd/htn/index.asp VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 58 of 159 Therefore, an ARB should be used with caution in patients who have previously experienced angioedema with an ACEI. [130] The Work Group acknowledges that the evidence for these recommendations is based primarily on data reviewed for the 2008 CKD CPG, and therefore, used a different evidence grading system. Given the positive renal benefit with an ACEI in non -diabetic CKD and albuminuria and with an ACEI or ARB in diabetic patients with CKD and albuminuria, the Work Group maintained these as \"Strong for\" recommendations for clinical practice. Additional data are needed to determine the CV outcome benefit with an ACEI or ARB in these patients with CKD. Combination RAAS blockade The recommendation against use of combination RAAS blockade (an ACEI and ARB, or an ACEI or ARB with a direct renin inhibitor) in patients with CKD is based on the 2014 CKD CPG evidence review. Although studies evaluating combination therapy with two agents that block the RAAS have reported a greater benefit in reduction of albuminuria in patients with CKD (trials also included patients with DM) compared to those receiving monotherapy, [132- 136] clinical trials did not demonstrate long -term benefit of reducing kidney disease progression with combination RAAS blockade in patients with CKD. [121- 123] There was no significant difference between treatment with combination ACEI and ARB versus ACEI or ARB monothe rapy on to ESRD, [121,122,125] death, [121, 122,124,125] or m easures of kidney function impairment including first occurrence of eGFR decline ,[122] >50% incr ease in SCr ,[121] or doubling SCr.[ 124, 125] In addition, in one clinical trial there was no significant difference between a combination of ACEI or ARB with a direct renin inhibitor versus monotherapy with either ACEI or ARB for the primary composite outcome that included CV and renal endpoints. [123] Treatment with combination therapy increased the risk for 125] AKI,[ compared to monotherapy. Thus, the Work Group agrees that the harms outweigh the benefit and support the 2014 CKD CPG \"S trong against \" recommendation for the use of combination RAAS blockade with an ACEI and ARB, or ACEI or ARB in combination with a direct renin inhibitor in patients with CKD. Based on the ev idence review for the 2014 CKD CPG, data were not available to adequately determine the impact on long- term outcomes such as progression to ESRD or death with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in combination with other RAAS blockade compared to monotherapy in patients with CKD. Results from one SR [ 137] and two controlled trials (one randomized, ope n-label) [138, 139] showed that additional RAAS blockade with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist further reduced proteinuria versus the comparator group. However, one trial [ 140] and one SR [ 125, 141] reported no significant difference in all-cause mortality or doubling SCr in patients receiving an ACEI who were randomized to an ARB, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, or placebo. The lack of benefit from the addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist to an ACEI or ARB or both, other than reduction in proteinuria, was also demonstrated in a more recent SR that was not a part of the 2014 CKD CPG evidence review. [141] Additional studies are needed to determine the impact on long -term clinical outcomes and safety of RAAS blockade in combination with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in patients with CKD. The mineralocorticoid receptor ant agonists, ACEIs, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors have all been associated with an increase in serum potassium and/or risk for hyperkalemia. When multiple RAAS blockers are used, the risk for hyperkalemia is further increased. [122, 124, 125, 137, 141] Most trials VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 59 of 159 evaluating combination RAAS blockade in patients with CKD excluded patients with blockade is not recommended in patients with CKD in general, if the combination is used (e.g., use of an ACEI or ARB in combination with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in patients with heart failure), increased diligen ce is recommended to monitor for hyperkalemia and AKI, which can also place additional burden and risk on the patient. Frequency of monitoring should take into account baseline serum potassium and renal function, adherence to low potassium diet, use of concomitant medications that may increase the risk for hyperkalemia, or conditions that may contribute to volume depletion. Providers may wish to consider nephrology consultation or collaboration in assessment of risk/benefit and development of monitoring pla n. As these three recommendations are all Not reviewed , and either Amended or Not changed, the Work Group did not systematically review the relevant evidence in this CPG update. Evidence supporting the use of an ACEI (or ARB if unable to tolerate an ACEI) in patients with non- diabetic CKD, hypertension, and albuminuria, [101- 113] and an or ARB in DM , hypertensi on, and albuminuria, [114- 120] stem from the 2008 CPG evidence review, w hile the evidence to recommend against the use of a combination of an ACEI and ARB, or an ACEI or ARB with a direct renin inhibitor, were reviewed during the 2014 CPG update. [121- 125] While the body of evidence has some limitations, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence and patient values and preferences support the Work Group's decision to carry forward these \"Strong for\" and \"Stron g against\" recommendations. See Appendix K for additional information on the use of ACEI and ARB in patients with CKD. c. Anemia Medications Recommendation 24. We suggest initiation of oral iron therapy to support iron requirements in patients with chronic kidney disease. (Weak for | Not r eviewed, Amended) Discussion Iron deficiency is common in patients with CKD for a variety of reasons. Bleeding (e.g., menstrual, GI, operative) and medications that may decrease intestinal iron absorption, such as phosphate binders or gastric acid inhibitors, may contribute to iron de pletion. In addition, patients with CKD are at increased risk of inflammation, resulting in elevated hepcidin levels, which may also contribute to poor GI absorption of iron and decreased iron release from macrophages. Diagnosing iron deficiency may be challenging in patients with CKD , and iron deficiency is a major cause of hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis -stimulating agent (ESA) therapy. Transferrin is the plasma iron transport protein, and low transferrin saturation reflects iron deficiency. Ferritin is the cellular storage protein for iron but may not accurately reflect iron stores because it is also a non -specific acute -phase reactant and may be elevated when there is infection and/or inflammation. Anemia may improve with iron supplementation in pa tients with CKD with normal ferritin levels, reflecting \"functional iron deficiency,\" so targeting higher ferritin targets may be necessary. [143] There is limited evidence to support specific ferritin and transferrin saturation levels to initiate iron therapy or to be used as targets. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 60 of 159 However, the 2006 KDOQI guidelines, not included in this evidence base, suggested ferritin levels be maintained above 100 ng/mL and transferrin saturation more than 20% in patients with CKD not on dialysis, [2] while the 2012 KDIGO guidelines recommended a trial of iron therapy if ferritin is 500 ng/mL and transferrin saturation is 30%.[ 144] Correction of absolute or relative iron deficiency is an important part of anemia management in patients with CKD , and several factors should be considered when determining the best route of administration for iron repletion for an individual patient. No studies have shown significant differences between most oral iron preparations with regard to efficacy and tolerability. Ferrous sulfate, which is the most commonly used oral iron preparation, is inexpensive and easily accessible; however, side effects (primarily GI related), drug interactions, and pill burden may hinder adherence and limit use of oral iron therapy .[145- 147] Small studies using radiolabeled iron preparations in iron -deficient women without CKD showed that every - other -day dosing of iron may be more effective at raising iron levels than conventional daily dosing due to the increase in hepcidin levels that occurs in some patients . Additionally, less frequent dosing may also help improve tolerability. [148, 149] A comprehensive SR by Albaramki et al. showed that IV iron therapy was asso ciated with a small but significant increase in hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation levels compared to oral iron .[150] A subsequent meta -analysis by Shepshelovich et al. showed that patients treated with IV iron were more likely to achieve an increase in hemoglobin with similar rates of all-cause mortality, ESA dose increases, blood transfusions , and adverse effects compared to oral iron therapy. [151] Concerns associated with the use of parenteral iron preparations include risk of anaphylaxis and hypotension, higher cost, as well as need for infusion capabilities. Newer IV iron preparations (e.g., iron sucrose, sodium ferric gluconate, ferric carboxymaltose, ferumoxytol) are associated with lower risk of severe adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis, compared to iron dextran. Depending on the product, IV iron may be given as an infusion or IV push over several visits without the added pill burden, making parenteral iron a more convenient option for selected patients. However, the availability of infusion capabilities and increase in resource utilization for preparation and administration of IV iron and observation for potential adverse reactions, as well as the need for IV access (which may be limited in patients who need to preserve blood vessels for future dialysis access) may make IV iron less practical. Blood transfusion can quickly correct anemia and furnish some iron. Risks associated with blood transfusion include allergic reactions, transfusion of blood -borne infection, acute or de layed hemolytic reactions, transfusion- related lung injury, and iron overload. Additionally, pre -transplant blood transfusions may cause allosensitization which may be associated with longer wait times to transplantation and increased rejection and graft loss post -transplant. Thus, blood transfusion is avoided in non- emergent situations whenever possible, particularly in potential transplant candidates .[152] Iron-based phosphate binders, such as ferric citrate, may be an option for patients with CKD, iron deficiency anemia and hyperphosphatemia. Ferric citrate decreases serum phosphate, increases ferritin and transferrin saturation and increases hemoglobin in patients with CKD not on dialysis .[146] The most common side effects associated with ferric citrate use include diarrhea, constipation, discolored feces and nausea. However, use of ferric citrate is associated with significant cost and pill burden (up to 12 tablets per day) as well as risk of iron overload. As this is a Not reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation and instead carried forward evidence included in the 2014 VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 61 of 159 CPG. [143, 150] In addition to the evidence reviewed in 2014, more recent evidence also supports this recommendation .[2,144- 149,151, 152] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low. While the body of evidence had some limitations, including use of a surrogate outcome, it supports the use of oral iron over IV iron ; however, parenteral iron may be used based on patient prefer ences regarding side effects, prior response to treatment, and accessibility/feasibility to IV iron therapy. As a result, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation. Recommendation 25. We recommend against initiating erythropoiesis -stimulating agents in patients with chronic kidney disease for the purpose of achieving a hemoglobin target above 11.5 g/dL due to increased risk of stroke and hypertension. (Strong against | Not r eviewed, Amended) 26. We recommend against initiating erythropoiesis -stimul ating agents at a hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dL. (Strong against | Not r eviewed, Not changed) Discussion Anemia, typically normocytic and normochromic, is a common complication in patients with CKD, usually most prevalent when eGFR is consistently below 30 mL /min. Anemia has been associated with fatigue, dyspnea, adverse effects on cardiac function as well as mental and cognitive decline. Common factors for anemia in CKD include lack of effective erythropoietin (EPO) production by diseased kidneys, shortened life of red blood cells in the uremic state, and chronic inflammatory state attributed to uremia result ing in altered iron absorption and decreased EPO responsiveness. Early diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with CKD are the cornerstones of clinical management, so regular surveillance for anemia in patients with CKD is recommended. The 2006 KDO QI guidelines recommended the use of hemoglobin to define anemia and evaluation when hemoglobin falls below 13.5g/dL in males and below 12g/dL in females. [2] Anemia of CKD is a diagnosis of exclusion; [2] thus, evaluation for other causes of anemia similar to patients with normal renal function, including nutritional deficiencies, blood loss, systemic illness , and defective erythropoiesis should be undertaken. While EPO deficiency contributes to anemia in patients with CKD , checking EPO levels is not recommended since serum EPO levels are usually inappropriately low in patients with CKD and generally not helpful in establishing the differential diagnosis of anemia. If other causes of anemia have been excluded and anemia does not respond to iron supplementation, referral of patients with CKD to a nephrologist to assess the need for therapy with ESAs should be considered. Though rare, risks and complications associated with blood transfusions can occur and include volume overload, allergic reaction, transmission of blood -borne infection, hemolytic reactions, transfusion -related acute lung injury , and iron overload. Aside from avoiding adverse events associated with red blood cell transfusions, limiting transfusions also averts the potential risk of alloimmunization in potential transplant candidates. Thus, minimizing blood transfusions in stable patients with CKD is recommended. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 62 of 159 ESA treatment is effective in raising the mean hemoglobin and reduces the need for blood transfusions in patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD, [153-156] but treatment with ESAs has also been associated with potential harms and significant burden s. Controlled trials on ESA treatment in patients with CKD and anemia from previous versions of the CKD CPG used to support these recommendations, including the Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (CHOIR), Cardiovascular Risk Reduc tion by Early Anemia Treatment with Epoetin Beta (CREATE), and Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy (TREAT) trials, showed greater risks for death, serious adverse CV reactions, and stroke with higher hemoglobin targets compared to lo wer hemoglobin targets.[ 156-158] Additionally, in patients with a history of malignancy, ESA use was associated with increased adverse events, including increased mortality from cancer, tumor progression, and thrombotic events. [159] Other burdens associated with ESA use for patients with CKD not on dialysis include drug cost, frequent clinic visits for ESA injections, and need for laboratory monitoring. Additional burdens to the provider managing ESA therapy include increase in resource utilization for laboratory monitoring, pharmacy and clinic nursing staff to dispense and administer medication, and ongoing surveillance of patient condition for prompt identification of critical findings requiring cessation of ESA treatment. ESA should be initiated after weighing the risks related to blood transfusion and ESA therapy with the benefits of alleviation of symptoms and avoiding blood transfusions. Primary care providers should, therefore, consider referral to nephrology or specialized clinic for ESA management. As these recommendations are Not r eviewed and either Amended or Not changed, the Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to them and instead carried forward evidence included in the 2014 CKD CPG. [153- 158] In addition to the evidence reviewed in 2014, more recent evidence also supports these recommendation s.[2,83,148,159-165] There is insufficient evidence to recommend specific thresholds for starting ESAs or for maintaining hemoglobin within a specific target range ; however, TREAT allowed for use of ESAs as rescue therapy when hemoglobin decreased below 9mg/dL, and ESAs were started in CREAT E trial when hemoglobin was below 10.5g/dL in the lower hemoglobin group. Therefore, the Work Group agreed that hemoglobin level less than 9 -10mg/dL would be reasonable for initiation of ESAs with use of a higher threshold if the patient was symptomatic. ESA dose should be adjusted based on response to iron therapy and the rate of hemoglobin changes while on ESA therapy. Guidance from the FDA, released in 2011, advised initiation of ESA treatment when hemoglobin falls below 10 g/dL, lowering or stopping ESA when hemoglobin level rises above 10g/dL and individualizing ESA dosing to use the lowest dose of ESA sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions .[163] Patients with certain comorbidities, such as heart failure or pulmonary disease, may need higher hemoglobin levels to alleviate symptoms. Based on available trial data, the Work Group recommends against initiating ESAs at a hemoglobin level greater than 10g/dL and against offering ESAs to patients with CKD for the purpose of achieving a hemoglobin target above 11.5g/dL due to increased risk of stroke and hypertension. Hypoxia -inducible factor prolyl- hydroxylase domain (HIF- PHD) inhibitors, such as vadadustat and roxadustat, may represent a novel alternative to ESA for the management of anemia in patients with CKD. HIF-PHD inhibitors appear to induce endogenous EPO synthesis and enhance iron mobilization. They have been shown to increase hemoglobin levels in anemic patients with CKD but are not currently FDA approved. [161, 164,165] The role of HIF- PHD inhibitors in the management of anemia in patients with CKD needs to be further elucidated. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 63 of 159 d. Bone Health Medications Recommendation 27. We suggest against offering calcitriol or active vitamin D analogs to patients with stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease and elevated parathyroid hormone levels. (Weak against | Not r eviewed, Amended) Discussion Active vitamin D compounds effectively decrease parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in all studies, but th e effects of active vitamin D compounds on serum calcium and phosphate levels and other effects on bone histomorphometric changes were inconsistent. Some studies showed significant increases in serum calcium and phosphate levels [ 166, 167] while others noted no differences in serum calcium or phosphate values.[ 168- 171] Palmer et al. (2009) reviewed studies describing bone histomorphometric changes, bone density , and fractures in patients with CKD treated with active vitamin D compounds. [172] Studies reporting changes in bone histomorphometry, which included small numbers of patients, suggested that oral calcitriol may slightly improve osteitis fibrosa, but may increase the risk of osteomalacia. In one study of 25 patients, no significant differences were found in bone mineral density at femoral neck or lumbar spine after 12 months of oral calcitriol therapy . In another study of 38 patients reported in the same SR , calcitriol did not improve fracture rates. Interestingly, while Thadhani et al. (2012) found significantly higher SCr levels in the paricalcitol group when compared to placebo, [167] differences in eGFR were not observed with cystatin C -based eGFR measurements . Researchers attributed the discrepancy in eGFR outcomes to a reported increase in creatinine production by active vitamin D drugs. As this is a Not reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation but reviewed the evidence from the 2014 CPG. [166- 172] Confidence in the quality of the evidence is low because data demonstrated inconsistent outcomes with use of active vitamin D compounds on different markers of mineral bone disease. In the absence of consistent evidence pointing toward kidney, bone or CV benefit (other than reduction in PTH levels) and the potential for hypercalcemia and cost burden, we suggest not offering calcitriol or active vitamin D analogs to patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD. Active vitamin D analogs or calcitriol may be useful in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD stage 5 or patients on dialysis, but use should be managed by a nephrologist. Given these considerations, the Work Group carried forward the \"Weak against\" recommendation . Recommendation 28. We suggest against offering calcimimetics to patients with stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease and elevated parathyroid hormone levels. (Weak against | Not r eviewed, Amended) Discussion Calcimimetic agents (oral cinacalcet or IV etelcalcetide) are FDA appro ved for the control of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with ESRD. Cinacalcet is also approved for treatment of hypercalcemia related to parathyroid carcinoma and in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who are not surgical VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 64 of 159 candidates for parathyroidectomy. Calcimimetics are not approved for use in patients with CKD who are not on dialysis. Chonchol et al. (2009) showed that cinacalcet effectively lowered PTH levels compared to placebo in a 32-week study of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4; h owever, approximately two -thirds of patients treated with cinacalcet developed hypocalcemia, and cinacalcet therapy led to a 20% increase in serum phosphorus levels. [173] Since the 2014 CKD CPG evidence review, a retrospective study by Perez -Ricart et al. (2016) of 32 patients with stage 3 to 5 CK D not on dialysis, treated with cinacalcet for at least one year, demonstrated a significant drop in PTH, but with an increase in serum phosphorus and a decrease in serum calcium levels. [174] The clinical significance of these biochemical changes is uncertain, but no studies have documented any bone/mineral or CV benefit of calcimimetic treatment in the CKD population. Due to lack of evidence of benefit and the substan tial risk of developing hypocalcemia and a moderate possibility of developing hyperphosphatemia with cinacalcet therapy, the Work Group suggests against the use of calcimimetics for the management of hyperparathyroidism in patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD. As this is a Not reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation, but reviewed the evidence from the 2014 CPG and amended the language of the recommendation.[ 173] In addition to the evidence reviewed in 2014, more recent evidence also supports this recommendation. [174] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of existing evidence is low because of the small patient population and few patients with CKD stage 3 and 4 who were not on dialysis and who received calcimimetics. Lowering PTH levels in patients with CKD who are not on dialysis has not shown a significant benefit compared to using calcitriol or active vitamin D analogues (see Recommendation 27 ). Potential harms include electrolyte abnormalities and cost. The Work Group therefore decided on a \"Weak against\" recommendation. Recommendation 29. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of phosphate binders to reduce mortality, progression of chronic kidney disease, or major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with stage 2 to 5 chronic kidney disease. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New- replaced) Discussion The evidence review for this update of the CKD CPG on the use of phosphate binders in patients with CKD included one SR and meta -analysis conducted by Ruospo et al. (2018). [175] This meta -analysis included three studies comparing sevelamer to placebo or usual care, and three studies comparing lanthanum to placebo or usual care, concluding that treatment with these phosphate binders did not reduce mortality, MI, decline in renal function or progression to ESRD. There was also no reduction in stroke with sevelamer versus placebo or usual care. In addition, there was no significant difference in mortality or change in eGFR with iron -based phosphate binders ( based on data from two studies) or calcium ( based on data from one study) compared to placebo or usual care. When sevelamer was compared to calcium (based on data from two studies), there was no statistically significant difference in mortality. Although there is epidemiologic evidence not included in the evidenc e review that hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 65 of 159 mortality in patients on dialysis, [176- 179] there is no evidence that the use of a phosphate binder will provide long- term outcome benefit. Phosphate binders effectively reduce serum phosphorus, but there is some variability in provider and patient preferences regarding their use. Adverse events associated with phosphate binders include constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and hypercalcemia, though the risk depends on the phosphate binder selected. Increased pill burden, cost of the medication , and need for lab monitoring should also be considered. Patients may elect to rely on dietary phosphate restriction, though nutrition evaluation should be considered to ensure that patients meet adequate protein needs. As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant evidence. [175] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low due to the limited number of high quality trials and lack of long -term data. There is therefore insuffi cient evidence to recommend for or against the use of phosphate binders in patients with CKD with normal serum phosphorus. Though phosphate binders are effective at reducing phosphate levels and hyperphosphatemia has been associated with increased mortalit y in dialysis patients, use of phosphate binders has not been associated with improvement in mortality or CV outcomes. Additional research focusing on the long- term effects of phosphate binders in the CKD population is needed. Thus, the Work Group opted fo r a \"Neither for nor against\" recommendation. e. Other Medications to Slow CKD Progression Recommendation 30. We suggest the use of sodium bicarbonate supplementation in patients with chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. (Weak for | Not r eviewed, Amended) Discussion An SR by Susantitaphong et al. (2012) of six studies with a total of 312 patients assessing the use of sodium bicarbonate as alkali therapy demonstrated that, for studies with a duration longer than two months, sodium bicarbonate therapy was associated with improvement in eGFR and a lower incidence of dialysis initiation. [180] In five of the six trials, the mean serum bicarbonate level at enrollment was less than 22 mEq/L . Treatment with sodium bicarbonate did not increase BP or worsen edema. The largest study in that SR was an RCT by de Brito -Ashurst et al. (2009) of 134 patients with CKD stage 4 who were observed for 24 months. [181] They found that treatment of metabolic with oral sodium bicarbonate was associated with slower decline in creatinine clearance (9% versus 45%; risk ratio [RR] 0.15; RR 0.13; p <0.001). An altern ative form of alkali therapy is a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. While not included in the 2014 CKD CPG evidence review, Goraya et al. (2014) treated 108 patients with CKD stage 3 for three years with usual care, oral sodium bicarbonate, or fruits and vegetables as the alkali therapy (n=36 for each arm). [182] Both the sodium bicarbonate and fruits and vegetables groups had less of a decline in eGFR compared to usual care. There was no increase in BP or hyperkalemia in either treatment arm, however, patients enrolled in the study were selected to be at low risk for hyperkalemia. While this additional study VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 66 of 159 confirm s the benefit of preserving kidney function with alkali therapy, the small number of patients and the pre -selection for not developing hyperkalemia prevents recommending fruits and vegetables as an alternative alkali therapy over sodium bicarbonate. As th is is a Not reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation but reviewed the evidence from the 2014 CPG.[ 180] The only newly published data since the last evidence review was the trial by Goraya et al. (2014) described above. [182] The data supporting sodium bicarbonate therapy to improve the plasma bicarbonate therapy in patients with metabolic acidosis is consistent across the trials, but the total number of patients included in the SR is small. Therefore, confidence in the quality of evidence remains very low. Patients may have trouble tolerating the gas from oral sodium bicarbonate, and the large size and number of pills required may affect medication adherence. Future research should include trials with larger number of patients to validate the long -term effect of alkali therapy on CKD progression as well as use of alternative types of alkali therapy, such as sodium citrate, potassium citrate, or potassium bicarbonate, which may be better tolerated than oral sodium bicarbonate or diets low in animal protein. The efficacy and safety of fruits and vegetables as a source of alkali should be studied in larger trials that include patients with advanced CKD. Recommendation 31. In patients with chronic kidney disease and asymptomatic hyperuricemia, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of urate -lowering therapy for the purpose of slowing progression of chronic kidney disease. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New- added) Discussion The evidence review conducted for the 2019 CPG regarding the use of urate -lowering therapy in delaying CKD progression included one SR and meta -analysis, [183] two RCTs,[ 184,185] and one post hoc subgroup analysis [186] of an RCT. An SR and meta -analysis by Pisano et al. (2017) showed that use of allopurinol was associated with lower incidence of progression to ESRD in patients with stage 2 -4 CKD compared to the control.[ 183] There was no difference in change in eGFR from baseline in a combined analysis of either allopurinol or febuxostat versus usual care or placebo. The evidence concerning eGFR is low quality due to the high inconsistency and indirectness in the studies used for the meta -analysis . Several of the studies included in the meta -analysis had high risk of bias, and th e authors did not include in the meta -analysis all studies that had sufficient data for analysis. An RCT by Kimura et al. (2018) compared febuxostat to placebo in CKD and found no difference in rates of change in renal function, stroke, or combined CV even ts.[185] Another RCT by Mukri et al. (2018) compared febuxostat to usual care and found no difference in change in eGFR from baseline or difference in CV events. [184] In a post hoc subgroup analysis of one RCT comparing febuxostat to allopurinol, there was no statistically significant difference in change in eGFR, but the trial was only six months in duration. [185, 186] Studies addressed patients with stage 2 or greater CKD with hyperuricemia and found that treatment longer than three months was associated with positive outcomes. As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the relevant evidence. [183- 186] Confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low due to serious limitations in study quality, inconsiste nt outcomes, and variable follow -up range. There is insufficient evidence that VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 67 of 159 urate -lowering therapy slows CKD progression. However, patients with CKD are at increased risk for gout, and use of urate -lowering therapy should be considered to mitigate the r isk of gout flares, which may be very painful. Diminishing the risk of gout flares would also obviate the need for non -steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids, which are used in the management of acute gout and may be problematic in the CKD population. Pill burden, medication side effects, and treatment costs should be considered before prescribing urate -lowering therapy. Initiation of urate lowering therapy may precipitate gouty attacks in some patients. Patients should be educated on this possibility, and o verlapping prophylactic therapy may be considered for a few weeks to address this concern . In addition, a n FDA boxed warning was recently added to the pro duct information for febuxostat .[187] Before prescribing allopurinol, providers should consider testing for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -B*5801 allele due to the elevated risk for developing severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) in patients who carry this allele. The HLA -B*5801 allele is most common in those of Asian descent, and patients of Korean descent with CKD stage 3 or greater and all patients of Han Chinese or Thai descent are at high risk for severe allopurinol hypersensitivity reaction. The consensus from the Work Group is that benefits may slightly outweigh harms/burden for this treatment. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Neither for nor against\" recommendation. Recommendation 32. In patients at risk for rapidly progressing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, we suggest offering tolvaptan in consultation with a nephrologist to slow decline in estimat ed glomerular filtration rate. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion Tolvaptan has been found to slow the intermediate endpoint of decline in e GFR by about 1 mL/minute/1.73 m2/year in patients with rapidly progressing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) , although use of tolvaptan has been associated with a n increased incidence of adverse effects. The long -term safety and efficacy for the reduction of hard renal outcomes, such as need for dialysis or transplant, have yet to be established .[188- 190] The Tolvaptan Efficacy and Safety in Management of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Its Outcomes (TEMPO) 3:4 trial in patients with ADPKD suggested that treatment with tolvaptan was associated with a slower decline in eGFR compared to placebo (mean change in eGFR of with over 36 months) .[188] However, more patients on tolvaptan discontinued study treatment due to adverse event s, including increase s in hepatotoxicity and aquaretic side effects such as thirst, polyuria, nocturia, urinary frequency ; 23% of tolvaptan patients withdrew from the study compared with 14% in the placebo group. The Replicating Evidence of Preserved Renal Function: an Investigation of Tolvaptan Safety and Efficacy in ADPKD ( REPRISE) trial also showed slower decline in eGFR of 2.34 mL/min/1.73 m2 with tolvaptan compared to 3.61 mL/min/1.73 m2 with placebo over a one year period. [189] A lower overall incidence of adverse events was noted in REPRISE; however, only patients who tolerated tolvaptan during an 8 -week screening phase were randomized to the active portion of this trial. Patients in this selected group receiving tolvaptan again reported a 7% absolute increase of adverse effects including aquaretic side effects, diarrhea, and fatigue (9.5% in the tolvaptan group versus 2.5% in the placebo group). VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 68 of 159 Besides the more common side effects noted above, significant concerns for the safety of tolvaptan have been identified with respect to hepatotoxicity. An increased risk of hepatic adverse events (10.9% in the tolvaptan group versus 5.3% in the placebo group; HR: 4.91) was observed in REPRISE. [189] Most cases of elevated hepatic enzymes improved with interruption or discontinuation of tolvaptan, and t he risk for liver toxicity may be mitigated with monthly monitoring of liver function tests facilitating early identification of hepatotoxicity. However, a 2018 FDA post -marketing review of tolvaptan reported a single case of liver failure requiring transplantation, despite monthly monitoring. [191] Considering the concern for hepatotoxicity, an FDA Risk Evaluatio n and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) has created a certification process for prescribers and a patient registry to limit prescriptive access for tolvaptan to those registered in the REMS program .[192] While these programs may reduce the risk for safety and adverse events, they cannot eliminate it entirely and the importance of a committed prescriber and a compliant patient are paramount to the safe use of this medication. Patients with ADPKD who are ex pected to benefit the most from tolvaptan include those with eGFR over 30 mL/min ute/1.73 m 2 with rapidly progressing disease. As ADPKD presents with a wide range of penetrance and rates of decline in renal function and significant toxicity may result from the agent, the Work Group strongly advises consultation with a nephrologist to identify patients likely to benefit from tolvaptan prior to initiation of therapy. Appropriate patient selection with regard to the patient's abilit y to tolerate side effects, maintain adequate hydration , and comply with frequent lab monitoring, as well as retain uninterrupted access to the medication and a committed nephrologist experienced in managing tolvaptan , must be carefully consider ed prior to offering therapy and be weig hed against the potential benefit of a 1 mL/minute/1.73 m 2/year slowing of the decrease in eGFR . Significant variability in provider and patient preferences, as well as variability in acceptance and tolerance of this treatment, is anticipated. The risk of adverse effects, the importance of maintaining adequate hydration , and closely monitoring liver function tests, medication cost s, and access to nephrology care should be discussed with the patient prior to initiating therapy . As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the available, relevant evidence. [188- 190] While overall confidence in the quality of the safety data evidence is moderate , it is lower for the efficacy data due to reliance on surrogate outcomes. Limitations of the current body of evidence include reliance on the use of surrogate outcomes and modeling systems for data analysis as well as an absence of long -term data demonstrating a reduction in ADPKD progression to ESRD. Despite tolerability and safety concerns, there is no other primary therapy available for patients with rapidly progressive ADPKD at this time. Thus, the Work Group has decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation for the use of tolvaptan in rapidly progressing ADPKD, to be prescribed in conjunction with a nephrologist. Further studies to assess the efficacy in reducing hard renal outcomes , such as need for dialysis and renal transplant, and safety of tolv aptan with long- term data are needed. E. Contrast -Associated Kidney Injury Management The risk of AKI following exposure to iodinated contrast media has been questioned. Although widely perceived as a common risk for AKI, recent epidemiologic studies, particularly among patients receiving IV contrast for computed tomography, have questioned the risks associated with contrast administration. McDonald et al. (2014) found similar rates of AKI among more than 20,000 propensity -matched patients VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 69 of 159 undergoing computed tomography with or without contrast enhancement (OR : 0.94; 95% CI : 0.83- 1.07; p=0.3 8).[193] In another analysis, the same investigators found no difference in the risk of AKI associated with contrast exposu re after stratifying by level of eGFR. [194] In contradistinction, however, in a separate cohort of more than 20,000 propensity -matched patients undergoing computed tomography with or without contrast enhancement, Davenport et al. (2013) found an increased risk of AKI among patients with a baseline SCr >1.5 mg/dL following p=0.007) with increasing risk with higher baseline SCr. [195] In a separate analysis, the same investigators found that IV iodinated contrast was associated with an odds of AKI of 1.40 (95% CI: 1.00 -1.97) for patients with m2 and of 2.96 (95% with an eGFR of <30 mL/minute/1.73 m2.[195] Based on these data, the Work Group concluded that patients with underlying kidney disease with reduced eGFR are at increased risk of CA -AKI following IV contrast administration. The risk of AKI following intra- arterial contrast exposure, as occurs during coronary and non- coronary angiography, is likely higher than the risk following IV contrast exposure. [196- 198] The risk of AKI following contrast exposure should be considered in decidi ng whether to perform contrast -enhanced diagnostic and therapeutic procedures; alternative imaging procedures should be considered, and the risks and benefits of using contrast should be explicitly discussed with patients for informed SDM. The risk of AKI associated with contrast exposure should not, however, prevent the performance of contrast -enhanced tomography and diagnostic or therapeutic angiography when indicated. Among some patients with CKD (e.g., patients with DM and an eGFR <60 mL /minute/1.73 m 2 or non - diabetic patients with an eGFR <45 mL/minute/1.73 m2), strategies to minimize the risk of CA -AKI should be implemented. These include use of the least nephrotoxic contrast media (low -osmolar or iso -osmolar contrast media), minimization of the volume of administered contrast media and avoidance of concomitant nephrotoxins, including, particularly, NSAIDs. Specific recommendations are provided below . Recommendation 33. For patients at increased risk for iodinated contrast -associated acute kidney injury, we recommend volume expansion with intravenous isotonic saline prior to and following iodinated contrast administration (see Algo rithm Module D for additional information). (Strong for | Reviewed, Amended ) Discussion The 2014 CKD CPG suggested that patients at increased risk for CA -AKI receive volume expansion with IV isotonic crystalloid solutions (saline or sodium bicarbonate) prior to and following contrast administration and suggested offering oral hydration to patients in which IV hydration is not feasible. Although there are only a limited number of studies directly comparing IV isotonic crystalloid to oral fluid administratio n in patients at high -risk for the development of CA -AKI, the Work Group concluded that the strength of evidence supporting the use of isotonic crystalloid to mitigate the risk for development of CA -AKI in high - risk patients is strong based on studies demo nstrating greater risk reduction associated with isotonic as compared to hypotonic fluid administration and associated with higher volumes of administered isotonic fluids. Based on the results of RCTs published since the 2014 CKD CPG evidence review, the W ork Group concluded that there is no evidence to support an added benefit to sodium bicarbonate administration compared to isotonic saline. Additionally, in the absence of commercially available isotonic sodium bicarbonate for IV infusion, bicarbonate solu tions must be compounded by adding concentrated sodium VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 70 of 159 bicarbonate to sterile water or 5% dextrose in water. The Work Group concluded that there is a potential risk of harm associated with sodium bicarbonate administration based on the risk of compounding errors and an increased cost without evidence of benefit. The 2014 CKD CPG evidence review identified a single meta- analysis of 513 patients of six trials comparing IV saline (five trials utilizing isotonic [0.9%] saline and one trial 0.45% various regimens of \"oral fluid\" administration. [199] Detailed analysis of the included trials reveals marked heterogeneity in the oral fluid administration arms. Three of the six studies included the administration of IV saline post -procedure and two involved the administration of water plus either oral sodium bicarbonate or oral sodium chloride. Only one study compared IV isotonic saline to unrestricted oral fluids. [200] In this study, only one patient (3.7%) in the saline group developed CA- AKI, defined based on an increase in SCr by 0.5 mg/dL within 48 hours of contrast exposure, as compared to nine patients (34.6%) in the oral hydration group (p=0.005). The study was t erminated early after only 53 patients were enrolled due to the high rate of CA -AKI in the oral hydration group. Based on this data, oral hydration should not be considered adequate for prophylaxis for CA -AKI. Since the 2014 CKD CPG evidence review, Nijsse n et al. (2017) compared IV isotonic saline (3 -4 mL/kg/hr for four hours pre - and post -contrast exposure or 1 mL/kg/hr for 12 hours pre - and post -contrast exposure) to no IV fluids among 660 patients with an eGFR of 30 -59 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 (52%) or angiography (48%) a mean contrast volume of 90 mL.[201] CA-AKI developed in 2.6% of patients who did not receive IV saline versus 2.7% of thos e receiving IV saline (p=0.47). Kooiman et al. (2014) compared pre -procedural administration of 250 mL of 1.4% bicarbonate to no IV fluids in 138 patients with CKD undergoing computed tomography pulmonary angiography and found an incidence of CA- AKI in 9.2% of patients receiving no IV fluids as compared to 7.1% of patients randomized to 4.03). [202] Given the relatively small volume of IV fluids administered and the overall small sample size, strong conclusions cannot be drawn from this study. Two studies, not included in the evidence base, compared the administration of post -procedural isotonic saline to no fluid administration among patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary angiography (PCI) in the setting of acute ST -segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). [203, 204] In this setting, it is logistically difficult to provide pre -procedural fluids due to the urgency of angiography. Among 216 patients presenting with acute STEMI, Luo et al. observed a reduction in the incidence of CA- AKI from all There was minimal benefit observed among low -risk patients; however, among patients with moderate to very high risk, the reduction in the incidence of CA- AKI ranged between 29% and 56%. [203] In the second study, the incidence of CA- AKI was 10.8% among the 204 patients randomized to intra - and post -procedural infusion of isotonic saline as compared to 21.1% among patients randomized to no fluids (p=0.016). [204] In an as -treated analysis, accounting for 74 patients who were randomized to no saline and required saline infusion due to severe hypotension, primarily in the setting of right ventricular infarction, and for 42 patients randomized to saline infusion in whom it needed to be discontinued due to the development of significant heart failure, the incidence of CA- AKI associated with saline infusion was 6.6% compare d to 21% among patients who did not receive saline. After multivariable adjustment, the OR for development of CA -AKI associated with saline administration was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.14 -0.66; p=0.003). VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 71 of 159 Brar et al. (2014) compared the use of higher volumes of IV saline (3 mL/kg over one hour followed by 1.5 - 5 mL/kg/hr over four hours guided by left ventricular end- diastolic pressure [LVEDP]) compared to a standard regimen of 3 mL /kg over one hour followed by 1.5 mL/kg/hour over four hours in 396 patients with an eGFR <60 mL /minute/1.73 m2 and decreased left ventricular function undergoing coronary angiography.[ 205] CA-AKI -guided fluid administration (total saline volume 1,727\u00b1583 mL) compared to 16.3% of patients in the control isotonic sodium bicarbonate for prevention of CA -AKI with variable results. A n Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Comparative Effectiveness Review identified 30 articles comparing IV sodium bicarbonate to IV isotonic saline. [206] Nineteen of these were included in the pooled meta -analysis; six studies concluded that sodium bicarbonate reduced the incidence of CA- AKI compared to IV saline and 13 found no difference. The pooled meta- analysis found no statistically significant difference between sodium bicarbonate and saline (pooled RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.68 - 1.27). Two additional studies have been published since the AHRQ review. [207, 208] Solomon et al. (2015) found no difference in either CA- AKI (14.5% with sodium bicarbonate versus 12.1% with isotonic saline; p=0.20) or a composite endpoint o f mortality, need for dialysis, or a sustained 20% reduction in eGFR at six months (14.9% with sodium bicarbonate versus 16.3% patients undergoing coronary or non- coronary angiography. [208] The Prevention of Serious Adverse Events Following Angiography (PRESERVE) trial evaluated 4,993 patients with DM with an eGFR <60 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 or without DM and an eGFR <45 mL /minute/1.73 m2 undergoing coronary or non- coronary angiography in a 2x2 factorial design comparing IV sodium bicarbonate to IV isotonic saline and N -acetylcysteine to placebo. [207] In the of isotonic sodium bicarbonate to isotonic saline, CA -AKI occurred in 9.5% of patients assigned to sodium bicarbo nate as compared to 8.3% endpoint of death, need for dialysis, or a persistent 50% increase in SCr at day 90 occurred in 4.4% of patients in the sodium bicarbo nate arm and 4.7% of 0.72- 1.22; p=0.62). Thus, the Work Group concluded that there was no benefit to sodium bicarbonate compared to saline. As this is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the evidence identified in the evidence review conducted for this CPG update [201 ,202,205-207] and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 CPG. [199] Findings from other studies outside of the SR also supported the recommendation. [203,204 ,208] The Work Group determined that the strength of evidence favoring the administration of isotonic IV crystalloid was low with conflicting data from poor quality studies, but evidence suggests that larger volumes of IV fluids were associated with greater benefit and those with more advanced CKD were more likely to benefit. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Strong for\" recommendation. The Work Group suggests that IV isotonic crystall oid be administered to reduce the risk of CA- AKI in high- risk patients (i.e., patients with DM and an eGFR <60 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 or non -diabetic patients eGFR <45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 undergoing angiography with intra-arterial contrast administration or patients with an eGFR <30 -45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 undergoing contrast -enhanced computed tomography), if there is no medical contraindication. The optimal rate and volume of infusion is uncertain; the Work Group suggests, from a practical standpoint, VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 72 of 159 that p atients with CKD undergoing outpatient angiographic or contrast -enhanced computed tomographic procedures be given at least 3 mL/kg of isotonic saline over one hour pre -procedure continu ed at a rate of 1 -1.5 mL/kg/ hour during the procedure, and at least an additional 6 mL/kg of isotonic saline over 2 -6 hours (rate of 1 -3 mL/kg/ hour) post -procedure. For inpatients, the Work Group suggests the administration of isotonic saline at 1 mL/kg/ hour for at least 6 -12 hours pre -procedure, intra- procedure and for at le ast 6 -12 hours post -procedure. These suggestions assume that an assessment of volume status has been done by the treating providers and that patients are reasonably considered to be able to tolerate this amount of fluid . Recommendation 34. We recommend against the administration of N- acetylcysteine for prevention of iodinated contrast -associated acute kidney injury. (Strong against | Reviewed, New- replaced) Discussion Studies evaluating the benefit of N -acetylcysteine for the prevention of CA -AKI have been inc onsistent. An AHRQ Comparative Effectiveness Review identified 67 RCTs and 11 observational studies, 54 of which, encompassing 4,749 patients, were included in a pooled meta -analysis.[ 206] The pooled RR for CA N -acetylcysteine. The PRESERVE trial evaluated 4,993 patients with DM with an e GFR <60 mL /minute/1.73 m2 or without DM and an eGFR <45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 undergoing coronary or non- coronary angiography a 2x2 factorial design comparing IV sodium bicarbonate to IV saline and N -acetylcysteine to placebo. [207] N- acetylcysteine was given as 1,200 mg by mouth one hour pre -angiography and one hour post -angiography and then continued at 1,200 mg by mouth twice daily for a total of 10 doses. CA- AKI occurred in 9.1% of patients assigned to N- acetylcysteine compared to 8.7% of patients 1.28; p=0.13). The primary study endpoint of death, need for dialysis, or a persistent 50% increase in SCr at day 90 occurred in 4.6% of patients in the N -acetylcysteine arm and 4.5% of patients in 0.78 -1.33; p=0.88). Wh ile patient harm was associated with oral N- acetylcysteine, IV N -acetylcysteine is associated with a risk of anaphylaxis. While these studies were limited to patients who were medically stable, there is insufficient data to recommend use of this agent in patients who are medically unstable, such as patients undergoing imaging procedures in the setting of sepsis or acute decompensated heart failure. Furthermore, in these settings, it is difficult to differentiate between AKI associated with contrast exposure and AKI due to other factors. In a recent meta -analysis N -acetylcysteine was not effective in preventing AKI following cardiac surgery. [209] As this i s a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the studies identified in the evidence review conducted for this CPG update. [206, 207] The quality of the evidence was low. However, t he two large RCTs (Acetylcysteine for Contrast -induced Nephropathy Tria l [ACT] and PRESERVE), [206, 207] which randomized a total of more than 7, 300 patients to N -acetylcysteine or placebo, provide strong evidence that N -acetylcysteine is ineffectiv e in the prevention of CA- AKI. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 73 of 159 Additionally use of N- acetylcysteine is associated with potential side effects and increased costs. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Strong against\" recommendation. Recommendation 35. We recommend against the use of renal replacement therapy for iodinated contrast -associated acute kidney injury prophylaxis. (Strong against | Reviewed, Amended) Discussion There are limited data on the benefit of RRT for the prevention of CA -AKI. The proposed mechanism of benefit for this intervention, rapid removal of the administered dye load, lacks biological plausibility as it would take 8 -12 hours of intermittent hemodialysis and a longe r durati on of continuous RRT to remove more than 90% of the administered dye load. In addition, some of the clinical trials of RRT have used change in SCr, a surrogate marker of CA -AKI that is removed by RRT, as a primary outcome. In a meta- analysis of six trials of hemodialysis not included in the evidence base, Cruz et al. (2012) found a pooled RR of 1.61 (95% CI: 1.13- 2.28) for the development of AKI with hemodialysis compared to standard management. [210] In three trials of hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration, Cruz et al. reported a pooled RR of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.12 -1.70); however, two of the three trials demonstrating benefit used change in SCr as the primary outcome. In the AHRQ Comparative Effectiveness Review, Subramaniam et al. (2016) found similar results and, based on the limitations of the studies and the risks of the procedures, concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support a clinically important benefit of RRT. [206] Given the potential for harm and the burden of therapy, including the need for insertion of large -bore central venous catheters to provide dialysis, the need to transfer patients to intensive care units to provide continuous hemofiltration and the expense of treatment, the Work Group recommends against the use of RRT for prevention of CA -AKI. As this is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the evidence identified in the evidence review conducted for this CPG update [206] and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 CPG. [211] Although the confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low, given the absence of benefit with a trend towards harm associated with prophylactic hemodialysis and the potential harms associated with implementing RRT, the Work Group decided upon a \"Strong against\" recommendation. Other Interventions for the Prevention of CA -AKI Data suggest that statin therapy may provide a benefit for prevention of CA -AKI through cholesterol metabolism -independent mechanisms. A n AHRQ Comparative Effect iveness Review identified 19 studies encompassing 10,574 individuals with varying combinations of co -interventions (IV saline, IV bicarbonate, and N -acetylcysteine) and comparators. [206] In a pooled analysis of studies comparing statin plus IV saline to IV saline alone, statin use was associated with a non -statistically significant reduction in the risk of CA - AKI (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.39- 1.20). In the pooled analysis of statins plus N -acetylcysteine plus IV fluids compared to N -acetylcysteine plus IV fluids, the risk reduction attained statistical significance (RR: 0.52; (95% CI: 0.29- meta -analysis of 15 RCTs (n=2,673) to assess the effectiveness of moderate to high -dose rosuvastatin in preventing CA- AKI.[ 212] In the pooled meta -analysis, patients treated with high -dose rosuvastatin had risk of CA -AKI (RR: 0.45; 95% VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 74 of 159 CI: 0.35- 0.58; p< 0.0001) in comparison to both low -dose rosuvastatin and placebo. The benefit was modestly p=0.03). However, there is the potential that the observed benefit is due to artifact associated with changes in creatinine kinetics associated with initiation of statin therapy. The Work Group therefore chose to make no recommendation regarding the use of statin therapy for prevention of CA -AKI in patients undergoing non- emergent angiography, noting that the majority of patients with CKD who undergo angiographic procedures have additional indications for statin therapy. Other interventions that have been evaluated for the prevention of CA -AKI include diuretics, dopamine, fenoldopam, adenosine antagonists and ascorbic acid. These agents have either been associated with insufficient evidence of benefit or harm with regard to the prevention of CA -AKI.[ 206] Although acute diuretic administration has been associated with increased risk of CA -AKI, there is no evidence to support discontinuation of chronic diuretic therapy in the periprocedural period to alter risk of CA -AKI. The use of remote ischemic preconditioning, which is outside the scope of this evi dence review, has been associated with benefit in early clinical trials, but should be considered to be an experimental intervention.[ 213] VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 75 of 159 VII. Future Research Research focusing on patients with CKD is lacking because CKD is a common exclusion criterion in many trials. As a result, much of the CKD research is based on retrospective observational studies with the associated biases or secondary cohort analyses of R CTs that did not target patients with CKD as the primary population. Future research should include more trials that specifically target patients with CKD and CKD specific outcomes. Additional studies are needed to determine: Adherence to guideline recommendations and improvements in patient outcomes Effects on non -nephrology -related outcomes, such as vascular disease, nutritional status, functional status , and mental health, in studies specific to patients with CKD Critical elements of comprehensive interv ention that lead to desired outcomes, including interdisciplinary care, education, behavior change approaches, and spiritual and emotional support Benefits and risks of screening patie nts for CKD; the VA's large population of patients with CKD would make t his an ideal trial for the VA Value/utility of prediction tools, such as KFRE, with regard to mortality and optimal timing of referral to nephrology and for dialysis access Likelihood of obtaining a functional arteriovenous access following PICC lines versus alternative approaches for vascular access Timing (e.g., stage of CKD) at which nephrology referral improves outcomes Benefits of interdisciplinary care interventions for patients with CKD, including identifying characteristics of patients with CKD that would benefit from interdisciplinary teams; supported self- efficacy and PCC Feasibility and impact of non -face -to-face care in collaboration with nephrology (e.g., telehealth, electronic consults, and programs such as Specialty Care Access Network -Extens ion for Community Healthcare Outcomes [ SCAN -ECHO]) Benefits of patient education, includin g early education interventions, technolo gy based learning (mobile apps), peer -to-peer educat ion, motivational interviewing, and education with family Effect of SDM on CKD outcomes; these studies should also seek to identify how to best achieve positive outcomes with SDM, the knowledge and tools needed to implement SDM regarding initiation and type of dialysis, and comparing SDM conducted by a primary care provider ve rsus a nephrologist Outcomes of comparing supportive care compared to dialysis between similar populations with equivalent comorbidities Optimal timing of palliative care initiation in advanced CKD Benefits of concurrent palliative care and dialysis, and feasibility and utility of palliative dialysis VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 76 of 159 Long- term impact of hyperphosphatemia and whether interventions to lower phosphate levels affect sequelae of hyperphosphatemia Long- term effect of glitazones, sodium glucose transporter inhibitors and dipeptid yl peptidase 4 inhibitors on renal outcomes in patients with CKD Long- term effect of BP lowering on renal outcomes to determine the optimal blood pressure lowering goal for patients with CKD Optimal pain management for patients with CKD VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 77 of 159 Appendix A : Evid ence Review Methodology A. Developing the Key Questions The CPG Champions, along with the Work Group, were tasked with identifying KQs to guide the SR of the literature on CKD. These questions, which were developed in consultation with the Lewin team, addressed clinical topics of the highest priority for the VA and DoD populations. The KQs follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions, as established by AHRQ. Table A-1 provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology. Table A -1. PICOTS [214 ] PICOTS Element Description Patients, Population, or Problem A description of the patients of interest. It includes the condition(s), populations or sub- populations, disease severity or stage, co -occurring conditions, and other patient characteristics or demographics. Intervention or Exposure Refers to the specific treatments or approaches used with the patient or population. It includes doses, frequency, methods of administering treatments, etc. Comparison Describes the interventions or care that is being compared with the intervention(s) of interest described above. It includes alternatives such as placebo, drugs, surgery, lifestyle changes, standard of care, etc. Outcome Describes the specific results of interest. Outcomes can include short, intermediate, and long -term outcomes, or specific results such as qualit y of life, complications, mortality, morbidity, etc. Timing, if applicable Describes the duration of time that is of interest for the particular patient intervention and outcome, benefit, or harm to occur (or not occur). Setting, if applicable Describes the setting or context of interest. Setting can be a location (such as primary, specialty, or inpatient care). The Champions, Work Group, and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the topics of interest. Due to resource constraints, all developed KQs could not be included in the systematic evidence review. Thus, the Champions and Work Group determined which questions were of highest priority, a nd those were included in the review. Table A-2 contains the final set of KQs used to guide the SR for this CPG. Once the KQs were finalized, the Work Group prioritized the outcomes they had defined for each KQ based on how important the Work Group judged each outcome to be. Ranking outcomes by their relative importance can help focus attention on those outcomes that are considered most important f or clinical decision making when making judgements regarding the overall quality of the evidence to support a recommendation. Using GRADE methodology, the Work Group rated each outcome on a 1 -9 scale (7 -9, critical for decision making; 4 -6, important, but not critical, for decision making; and 1 -3, of limited importance for decision making). Critical and important outcomes were included in the evidence review (see Outcomes ); however, only outcomes judged to be critical were used to determine the overall quality of evidence (see Grading Recommendations ).

Conducting the Systematic Review Based on the decisions made by the Champions and Work Group members regarding the scope, the KQs, and the PICOTS statements, the Lewin Team produced an SR protocol prior to conducting the review. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Champions and Work Group membe rs. It described in detail the final set of KQs, the methodology to be used during the SR process, and the inclusion/exclusion criteria to be applied to each potential study, including, but not limited to, study type, sample size, and PICOTS criteria. Extensive literature searches identified 5,308 citations potentially addressing the KQs of interest to this evidence review. Of those, 4,044 were excluded upon title review for clearly not meeting inclusion criteria (e.g., not pertinent to the topic, not published in English, published prior to study inclusion publication date, or not a full- length article). Overall, 1,264 abstracts were reviewed with 819 of those being excluded for the following reasons: not an SR or clinical study (see the General Criteria for Inclusion in Systematic Review and Key Question Specific Criteria ), did not address a KQ of interest to this review, did not enroll population of interest, or publ ished prior to December 2013. A total of 445 full- length articles were reviewed. Of those, 185 were excluded at a first pass review for the following: not addressing a KQ of interest, not enrolling the population of interest, not meeting inclusion criteria for clinical study or SR , or being a duplicate. A total of 260 full length articles were thought to address one or more KQs and were further reviewed. Of these, 155 were ultimately excluded. Reasons for their exclusion are presented in Figure A-1 . Overall, 105 studies addressed one or more of the K Qs and were considered as evidence in this review. Table A-2 indicates the number of studies that addressed each of the questions.

General Criteria for Inclusion in Systematic Review Clinical studies or SRs published on or after December 1, 2013 to September 14, 2018. If multiple SRs address a KQ , we selected the most recent and/or comprehensive review. S Rs were supplemented with clinical studies published subsequent to the SR . Studies must have been published in English. Publication must have been a full clinical study or SR ; abstracts alone were not included. Similarly, letters, editorials, and other publications that are not full- length clinical studies were not accepted as evidence. SRs must have searched MEDLINE or EMBASE for eligible publications, performed a risk of bias assessment of included studies, and assessed the quality of evidence using a recogniza ble rating system, such as GRADE or something compatible (e.g., the one used by the AHRQ Evidence - based Practice Center). If an existing review did not assess the overall quality of the evidence, evidence from the review must have been reported in a manner that allowed us to judge the overall risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision of evidence. We did not use an existing review as evidence if we were not able to assess the overall quality of the evidence in the review. Intervention studies must have assessed screening/diagnostic tests, risk prediction tools, pharmacological or non -pharmacological treatment approaches and be a prospective RCT with an independent control group. Randomized crossover trials were included only if data from the first period (prior to treatment crossover) was reported separately. For certain KQs non - randomized study designs were acceptable (see Key Question Specific Criteria below). Study must have enrolled at least 20 patients (10 per study group) unless otherwise note d (see Key Question Specific Criteria below). Study must have enrolled at least 85% of patients who meet the study population criteria: adults who have (or may have) CKD. Study must have reported on at least one outcome of interest. b. Key Question Specif ic Criteria For KQ 1, 3 -5, and 7, SR s of acceptable study designs, RCTs and comparative observational studies, such as large prospective (>100 patients/arm) or retrospective (>200 patients/arm) cohort or case -controlled studies were required. For KQ 2, SRs of acceptable study designs, RCTs, and prospective or retrospective cohort studies that compare a diagnostic test to clinical assessment, a different diagnostic test, or no diagnostic test with regard to ability to stratify risk of CKD complications were required. For KQs 6 and 8 -12, SRs of acceptable study designs and RCTs were required. If there was insufficient evidence from these study designs for any KQ, we considered evidence from large prospective (>100 patients/arm) or retrospective (>200 patients/ arm) cohort or case -controlled studies.

Convening the Face -to-face Meeting In consultation with the COR, the Champions, and the Work Group, the Lewin Team convened a three and one half day face -to-face meeting of the CPG Champions and Work Group members on November 13 - 16, 2018. These experts were gathered to develop and draft the clinical recommendations for an update to the 201 4 CKD CPG. Lewin presented findings from the evidence review in order to facilitate and inform the process. Under the direction of the Champions, the Work Group members were charged with interpreting the results of the evidence review and were asked to categorize and carry forward recommendations from the 2014 CKD CPG, modifying the recommenda tions as necessary. The members also developed new clinical practice recommendations not presented in the 2014 CKD CPG based on the 2018 evidence review. The subject matter experts were divided into three smaller subgroups at this meeting. As the Work Gro up members drafted clinical practice recommendations, they also assigned a grade for each recommendation based on a modified GRADE and USPSTF methodology. Each recommendation was graded by assessing the quality of the overall evidence base, the associated benefits and harms, the variation in values and preferences, and other implications of the recommendation. In addition to developing recommendations during the face -to-face meeting, the Work Group members also revised the 2014 CKD CPG algorithms to reflect the new and amended recommendations. They discussed the available evidence as well as changes in clinical practice since 2013, as necessary, to update the algorithms. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 91 of 159 D. Grading Recommendations This CPG uses the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a strength for each recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation: [215] Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Confidence in the quality of the evidence Values and preferences Other implications, as appropriate, e.g.,: Resource use Equity Acceptability Feasibility Subgroup considerations The following sections further describe each domain. Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes refers to the size of anticipated benefits (e.g., increased longevity, reduction in morbid event, resolution of symptoms, improved quality of life, decrease d resource use) and harms (e.g., decreased longevity, immediate serious complications, adverse event, impaired quality of life, increased resource use, inconvenience/hassle) relative to each other. This domain is based on the understanding that the majorit y of clinicians will offer patients therapeutic or preventive measures as long as the advantages of the intervention exceed the risks and adverse effects. The certainty or uncertainty of the clinician about the risk -benefit balance will greatly influence t he strength of the recommendation. Some of the discussion questions that fall under this domain include: Given the best estimate of typical values and preferences, are you confident that the benefits outweigh the harms and burden or vice versa? Are the des irable anticipated effects large? Are the undesirable anticipated effects small? Are the desirable effects large relative to undesirable effects? Confidence in the quality of the evidence reflects the quality of the evidence base and the certainty in that evidence. This second domain reflects the methodological quality of the studies for each outcome variable. In general, the strength of recommendation follows the level of evidence, but not always, as other domains may increase or decrease the strength. The evidence review used for the development of recommendations, conducted by ECRI, assessed the confidence in the quality of the evidence base using GRADE methodology and assigned a rating of \"High,\" \"Moderate,\" \"Low,\" or \"Very Low.\" The outcomes judged to be critical were used to determine the overall quality of evidence. Per GRADE, if the quality of evidence differs across the critical outcomes, the lowest quality of evidence for any of the relevant critical VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 92 of 159 outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation; the overall confidence cannot be higher than the lowest confidence in effect estimates for any outcome that is determined to be critical for clinical decision making. [18,216] The elements that go into the confidence in the quality of the evidence include: Is there high or moderate quality evidence that answers this questio n? What is the overall certainty of this evidence? Values and preferences is an overarching term that includes patients' perspectives, beliefs, expectations, and goals for health and life. More precisely, it refers to the processes that individuals use in considering the potential benefits, harms, costs, limitations, and inconvenience of the therapeutic or preventive measures in relation to one another. For some, the term \"values\" has the closest connotation to these processes. For others, the connotation of \"preferences\" best captures the notion of choice. In general, values and preferences increase the strength of the recommendation when there is high concordance and decrease it when there is great variability. In a situation in which the balance of benefits and risks are uncertain, eliciting the values and preferences of patients and empowering them and their surrogates to make decisions consistent with their goals of care becomes even more important. A recommendation can be described as having \"similar values,\" \"some variation,\" or \"large variation\" in typical values and preferences between patients and the larger populations of interest. Some of the discussion questions that fall under the purview of values and preferences include: Are you confident about the typical values and preferences and are they similar across the target population? What are the patient's values and preferences? Are the assumed or identified relative values similar across the target population? Other implications consider the pract icality of the recommendation, including resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility and subgroup considerations. Resource use is related to the uncertainty around the cost -effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventive measure. For example statin use in the frail elderly and others with multiple co -occurring conditions may not be effective and, depending on the societal benchmark for willingness to pay, may not be a good use of resources. Equity, acceptability, feasibility, and subgroup considerations r equire similar judgments around the practically of the recommendation. The framework below ( Table A -4) was used by the Work Group to guide discussions on each domain. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 93 of 159 Table A -4. GRADE Evidence to Recommendation Framework Decisi on Domain Questions to Consider Judgment Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Given the best estimate of typical values and preferences, are you confident that the benefits outweigh the harms and burden or vice versa? Are the desirable anticipated effects large? Are the undesirable anticipated effects small? Are the desirable effects large relative to undesirable effects? Benefits outweigh harms/burden Benefits slightly outweigh harms/ burden Benefits and harms/burden are balanced Harms/burden slightly outweigh benefits Harms/burden outweigh benefits Confidence in the quality of the evidence Is there high or moderate quality evidence that answers this question? What is the overall certainty of this evidence? High Moderate Low Very low Values and preferences Are you confident about the typical values and preferences and are they similar across the target population? What are the patient's values and preferences? Are the assumed or identified relative values similar across the target population? Similar values Some variation Large variation Other implications (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations) Are the resources worth the expected net benefit from the recommendation? What are the co sts per resource unit? Is this intervention generally available? Is this intervention and its effects worth withdrawing or not allocating resources from other interventions? Is there lots of variability in resource requirements across settings? Various considerations The strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects and is based on the framework above, which combines the four domains. [217] GRADE methodology does not allow for recommendations to be made based on expert opinion alone. While strong recommendations are usually based on high or moderate confidence in the estimates of effect (quality of the evidence) there may be instances where strong recommendations are warranted even when the quality of evidence i s low.[ 215] In these types of instances where the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes and values and preferences played large roles in determining the strength of a recommendation, this is explained in the discussion section for the recommendation. The GRAD E of a recommendation is based on the following elements: Four decision domains used to determine the strength and direction (described above) Relative strength (Strong or Weak) Direction (For or Against) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 94 of 159 The relative strength of the recommendation is base d on a binary scale, \"Strong\" or \"Weak.\" A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation. Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicate s that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences. Occasionally, instances may occur when the Work Group feels there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against a particular therapy or preventive measure. This can occur when there is an absence of studies on a particular topic that met evidence review inclusion criteria, studies included in the evidence review report conflicting results, or studies included in the evidence review report inconclusive results regardi ng the desirable and undesirable outcomes. Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum: Strong For (or \"We recommend offering this option ...\") Weak For (or \"We suggest offering this option ...\") No recommendation for or against (or \"There is insufficient evidence...\") Weak Against (or \"We suggest not offering this option ...\") Strong Against (or \"We recommend against offering this option ...\") Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed \"Conditional,\" \"Discretionary,\" or \"Qualified.\" Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary. E. Recommendation Categorization a. Recommendation Categories and Definitions A set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used b y NICE. [14,15] These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which recommendations could have been updated from the 2014 CKD CPG. The categories and definitions can be found in Table A -5. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 95 of 159 Table A -5. Recommendation Categories and Definitions * Evidence Reviewed Recommendation Category Definition Reviewed New -added New recommendation following review of the evidence New -replaced Recommendation from previous CPG that has been carried over to the updated CPG that has been changed following review of the evidence Not changed Recommendation from previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG where the evidence has been reviewed but the recommendation is not changed Amended Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG where the evidence has been reviewed and a minor amendment has been made Deleted Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been removed based on review of the evidence Not reviewed Not changed Recommendation from previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG, but for which the evidence has not been reviewed Amended Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG where the evidence has not been reviewed and a minor amendment has been made Deleted Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been removed because it was deemed out of scope for the updated CPG *Adapted from the NICE guideline manual (2012) [ 14] and Garcia et al. (2014) [15] Abbreviation: CPG: clinical practice guideline b. Categorizing Recommendations with an Updated Review of the Evidence Recommendations were first categorized by whether or not they were based on an updated review of the evidence. If evidence had been reviewed, recommendations were categorized as \"New added\" recommendations were original, new recommendations that were not in the 2014 CKD CPG. \"Re viewed, New -replaced\" recommendations were in the previous version of the guideline, but were modified to align with the updated review of the evidence. These recommendations could have also included clinically significant changes to the previous version. Recommendations categorized as \"Reviewed, Not changed\" were carried forward from the previous version of the CPG unchanged. For recommendations carried forward to the updated CPG with review of the evidence and slightly modified wording, the \"Reviewed, Amended\" recommendation category was used. This allowed for the wording of the recommendation to reflect GRADE methodology as well as for any other non -substantive (i.e., not clinically meaningful) language changes deemed necessary. The evidence used to support these recommendations was carried forward from the previous version of the CPG and/or was identified in the evidence review for the update. Recommendations could have also been designated \"Reviewed, Deleted.\" These were recommendations from the previo us version of the CPG that were not brought forward to the updated guideline after review of the evidence. This occurred if the evidence supporting the recommendations was out of date, to the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 96 of 159 extent that there was no longer any basis to recommend a particular course of care and/or new evidence suggests a shift in care, rendering recommendations in the previous version of the guideline obsolete. c. Categorizing Recommendations without an Updated Review of the Evidence There were also cases in which it was necessary to carry forward recommendations from the previous version of the CPG without an updated SR of the evidence. Due to time and budget constraints, the update of the CKD CPG could not review all available evidence on management of CKD, but instead foc used its KQs on areas of new or updated scientific research or areas that were not previously covered in the CPG. For areas of research that have not changed, and for which recommendations made in the previous version of the guideline were still relevant, recommendations could have been carried forward to the updated guideline without an updated SR of the evidence. The support for these recommendations in the updated CPG was thus also carried forward from the previous version of the CPG. These recommendations were categorized as \"Not reviewed.\" If evidence had not been reviewed, recommendations could have been categorized as \"Not changed,\" \"Amended,\" or \"Deleted.\" \"Not reviewed, Not changed\" recommendations refer to recommendations from the previous versio n of the CKD CPG that were carried forward unchanged to the updated version. The category of \"Not reviewed, Amended\" was used to designate recommendations which were modified from the 2014 CKD CPG. Recommendations could also have been categorized as \"Not reviewed, Deleted\" if they were determined to be out of scope. A recommendation was out of scope if it pertained to a topic (e.g., population, care setting, treatment, condition) outside of the scope for the updated CPG as defined by the Work Group. The categories for the recommendations included in the 2019 version of the guideline are noted in the Recommendations . The categories for the recommendations from the 2014 CKD CPG are noted in Appendix D . F. Drafting and Submitting the Final Clinical Practice Guideline Following the face -to-face meeting, the Champions and Work Group members were given writing assignments to craft discussion sections to support each of the new recommendations and/or to update discussion sections from the 2014 CKD CPG to support the amende d \"carried forward\" recommendations. The Work Group also considered tables, appendices, and other sections from the 2014 CKD CPG for inclusion in the update. During this time, the Champions and Work Group also made additional revisions to the algorithms, as necessary. After developing the initial draft of the updated CPG, an iterative review process was used to solicit feedback on and make revisions to the CPG. Once they were developed, the first two drafts of the CPG were posted on a wiki website for a period of 14 -20 business days for internal review and comment by the Work Group. All feedback submitted during each review period was reviewed and discussed by the Work Group and appropriate revisions were made to the CPG. Draft 3 of the CPG was made available for peer review and comment. This process is described in the section titled Peer Review Process . After revisions were made based on the feedback received during the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 97 of 159 peer review and comment period, the Champions prese nted the CPG to the EBPWG for their approval. Changes were made based on feedback from the EBPWG and the guideline was finalized. The Work Group also produced a set of guideline toolkit materials which included a provider summary, pocket card, and patient summary. The final 2019 CKD CPG was submitted to the EBPWG in September 2019. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 98 of 159 Appendix B : Patient Focus Group Methods and Findings A. Methods In April 2018, the VA and the DoD commenced the effort to update the VA/DoD CKD CPG. As part of the effort to update this CPG, the VA and DoD Leadership, along with the CKD Champions and The Lewin Team, held a patient focus group on June 11, 2018, at the Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital - South Texas Veterans Health Care System. The aim of the focus group was to further understand and incorporate the perspective of patients with CKD who are covered and/or receiv e their care through the VA and/or DoD hea lthcare systems, as patients are most affected by the recommendations put forth in the CPG. The focus group explored patients' perspectives on a set of topics related to management of CKD in the VA and DoD healthcare systems, including patients' knowledge of treatments for CKD, views on the delivery of care, patients' priorities and treatment challenges, as well as the impact of comorbidities on the patients and their treatments for CKD. Participants for the focus group were recruited by several of the CPG Champions and members of the Work Group. Patient focus group participants were not intended to be a representative sample of VA and DoD patients who have CKD. However, recruitment focused on eliciting a range of perspectives likely to be relevant and informative in the guideline development process. Patients were not incentivized for their participation or reimbursed for travel expenses. The CKD CPG Champions and Work Group, with support from Lewin, developed a set of questions to help guide the focus group discussion. The focus group facilitator led the discussion using the previously prepared questions as a general guide to elicit the most important information from the patients regarding their experiences and views about their treatment and overall care. By design, the flow of the discussion was subject to the information, knowledge, and interests of the focus group participants, so not all of the listed questions were addressed. Nine participants participated in the focus group, eight men and one woman. Five participants were receiving care from the VA and four were receiving care from the DoD. B. Findings a. Recognize the importance of communication and collaboration between care providers, particularly between nephrologists and primary care. Providers should coordinate patient care across specialties. While patients often excel at self- advocacy, primary care providers should communicate treatment plans to other providers and create a cohesive strategy for managing all of patients' medical conditions. Educate providers on contrast -induced nephropathy (CIN). If contrast agents are needed during imaging procedures, patient should be informed of the potential risks to kidney functioning. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 99 of 159 b. Understand patient -specific goals, priorities, values, and preferences and use shared decision making to develop a patient -centered plan for treatment. Patients greatly value quality of life and the ability to maintain their lifestyle. Use two -way communication and shared decision making to develop an individualized treatm ent plan; discuss treatment options in conjunction with each patient's goals, priorities, values, and preferences. Understand that patients vary in their treatment goals. For some, preservation of current quality of life is often preferable to aggressive t reatment. c. Educate patients about their kidney disease. Diagnosis often comes as a shock to patients, and understanding why they have kidney disease is of great importance to patients. Patients often fear that exposure to chemicals during their military deployment may have led to their CKD. Educate patients on the specific cause(s) of their kidney disease. Patients were very surprised when they found out that they had CKD. In looking for a reason for their diagnosis, many focused on their military deploym ent and the chemicals they were exposed to. Patients were generally unaware that managing their hypertension contributes to managing their kidney disease. Educating patients on how blood pressure relates to kidney function may improve their understanding of CKD and allow them to better manage their treatment. d. Provide nutrition and dietary guidance keeping in mind patient's individual lifestyle and cultural differences. The patients who had seen a dietitian stated that it helped them adhere to their nutrition plan while those who did not reported difficulty maintaining a healthy diet. Encourage patients to see a dietitian in order to improve adherence to their nutritional treatment plan. Patients and their family members who were referred to a dietitian s aid that they benefitted from their advice and found it much easier to maintain a healthy diet. e. Patients' biggest fear regarding their kidney disease is having to go on dialysis; they observe others on dialysis and infer what it would be like for them. Educating patients about the experience of dialysis may alleviate their fears and give them a better understanding of their treatment options. Patients' biggest fear related to their kidney disease is that they will be forced to go on dialysis. Based on co nversations with friends and family who have undergone dialysis, patients fear that their quality of life will drastically deteriorate. Some elderly patients expressed that they may choose to forgo dialysis to preserve their quality of life. f. Create a su pport group for kidney disease patients. Patients have a number of fears regarding their kidney disease, particularly having to go on dialysis, and may benefit from discussing these issues with other patients at various stages of CKD. Participants expresse d a desire to join a support group for people with kidney disease and their families. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 100 of 159 g. Offer telemedicine and other technology options to augment care, but recognize these options may not align with the preferences of all patients. Patients did not have any strong preferences regarding the use of telemedicine and electronic health technology. Older participants tended to prefer face -to-face interactions with providers, while younger participants appreciated having the option of virtual meeting s and were open to using medical mobile apps and other technology -based tools to aid in their careVA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 101 of 159 Appendix C: Evidence Table Table C-1.

[218] A geriatric approach to care that addresses the higher prevalence of geriatric conditions, such as dementia, functional limitations, and multi- complexity may be appropriate for older Veterans with CKD. Table J-1. Relevance and Application of Geriatric Approach to Older Veterans with CKD Using the 5 M's [219] Relevance to CKD Approach Mind Cognitive impairment increases at lower eGFR. Cognitive impairment is common among older adults with ESRD. Depressive symptoms are associated with prevalent CKD, worsening kidney function and ESRD. In ESRD, depression is associated with worse outcomes. Simplify CKD self -management tasks including medication regimens when possible Include family or caregivers in decision making Address depression to improve QoL Mobility Mobility impairment and function decline are common. Functional limitations are associated with death and adverse health outcomes in CKD. At dialysis initiation 50% of older adults are dependent in ADLs, 25% need nursing home level care. Falls are common a mong older adults with CKD and ESRD. Use a n SDM approach that considers prognosis Anticipate increased need for functional assistance after dialysis initiation Consider PT/OT/physical activity to maintain or improve function and reduce fall risk Medicat ions Polypharmacy is common in CKD and the risk for adverse drug events and poor health outcomes is high.

Other Considerations Heterogeneity in life expectancy: Older adults can expect to live fewer years than younger patients, however there is variability in life expectancy at all ages. For example, the top quartile of 80 year olds with eGFR 30 -44 mL/minute/1.73 m2 may live an additional seven years or more compared to the lowest quartile who may live less than two years.[ 220] Competing risk of mortality: Many older adults are likely to die before they experience kidney failure or require dialysis. [221] Challenges estimated and interpreting eGFR: Older adults were not included in large numbers in the studies used to develop eGFR equations, so these equations may not be accurate in older adults. Exclusion of older adults fro m clinical trials: Older adults or those with multiple chronic conditions are often excluded from clinical trials, limiting the generalizability of those studies to older populations. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 133 of 159 Appendix K: Nephrotoxic Agents and Medication Dose Adjustme nts in CKD A. Background This appendix provides information on avoid ing or limit ing the use of nephrotoxic medications in patients with CKD and is intended to provide general guidance for the primary care provider on the more common or critical nephrotoxic medications and on medications where particular caution or dose adjustment is advised in patients with CKD. The majority of the available literature on nephrotoxicity of medications is from case reports, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data, or surveillance [222] or database studies. [223] In addition to the information provided, the product information should be consulted for contraindications or precautions in patients with CKD, or specific recommendations on dosing modifications, where appropriate, according to the patient's kidney function. Nephrotoxicity remains an important consideration in the care of patients with CKD and an area where additional research is needed .[224] B. Nephrotoxic Medications Accord ing to an analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2004 (quarter 1) to 2015 (quarter 3), 2.1% of more than 7.2 million adverse events reported overall were reports of AKI. Of these, the medications most commonly associated w ith a report of AKI included aprotinin, sodium phosphate, furosemide, vancomycin, and metformin. In addition, of the reports of AKI, the majority (64.8%) were identified as new potential nephrotoxins, with only 16.5% due to known nephrotoxins and 18.6% pos sible nephrotoxins. Many commonly used medications may be nephrotoxic to patients with CKD. Examples of these categories of medications include: Analgesics ascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF ) inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors) Contras t dye (See Recommendations 3 3-35 on CA -AKI management and Herbal products (aristolochic acid, cats claw, licorice root) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 134 of 159 Nephrotoxicity may result from various mechanisms and result in different manifestations. Drugs may alter intraglomerular hemodynamics, induce inflammation (glomerulonephritis or interstitial nephritis), or form crystals, which would manifest as renal dysfunction, hematuria or proteinuria. In addition, drugs may cause rhabdomyolysis and thrombotic microangiopathy, which may also cause renal injury. Direct tubular injury more commonly presents with electrolyte abnormalities, including Fanconi -like syndrome. Finally, some medications may induce or exacerbate hypertension. General recommendations include avoiding use of nephrotoxic medications or use of non- nephrotoxic alternatives whenever possible, adjusting medication dose based on kidney function, ensuring adequate hydration, and close monitoring of the patient for evidence of nephrotoxicity when high- risk medications are used. C. Medication dose adjustments in CKD Many common medications are renally eliminated, and reduced kidney function may lead to drug accumulation with toxic effects specific to the drug. Dose adjustments are most often based on the patient's SCr, CrCl, or eGFR. The extent of dose reduction typically depends on the level of kidney function, and some medications may be contraindicated in those with severe renal dysfunction. Most often, as the data to evaluate the need for dose adjustment in patients with CKD is part of the FDA approval process, recommendations frequently rely primarily on the manufacturer's product labeling, though recommendations for dose adjustment may change based on post -market ing studies (e.g., as for metformin). Several references are also available with compiled drug information on recommended dosing based on kidney function; however, the information may vary among sources. Table K -1 includes a sele ct list of commonly used medications that may require dose adjustment based on kidney function or that warrant caution in patients with CKD. Table K -1. Selected Medications with Recommended Dose Adjustments or to be Used with Caution in Patients with CKD * Category Medications Antibiotics and antiviral agents All antibiotics and antiviral agents with the exception of: VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 135 of 159 Category Medications Hypoglycemic agents Insulin, metformin, exenatide Sulfonylureas Memantine, halantamine *This is not a comprehensive list; consult individual product information or alternate drug information resources for dosing information and/or precautions in patients with kidney function impairment. Also refer to previous discussion and list of potentially nephrotoxic medications. -glucose cotransporter -2 Renal dysfunction may also exacerbate the adverse effects of some medications. For example, though an increase in potassium is a well- described side effect of ACEI s, ARB s, potassium -sparing diuretics, trimethoprim, digoxin, and heparin, patients with CKD are more likely to experience clinically significant hyperkalemia, particularly if these medications are used in concomitantly. Similarly, patients with CKD may have an underlying acidosis and are more likely to develop metformin -associated lactic acidosis. The manufacturer's product information should be consulted to determine appropriate dosing based on the patient's kidney function, and monitoring for these adverse effects should be performed. Use of an ACEI or an ARB is frequently recommended in patients with CKD ( see Recommendation 22 , RAAS Blockade ). ACEI and ARB are useful in the management of hypertension. Additionally, ACEI and ARBs have been associated with both an antiproteinuric and renoprotective effect. General considerations and precautions on the use of these agents in patients with CKD are as follows: Start with lower doses in patients with CKD (except fosinopril , due to partial compensation by hepatobiliary elimination) Start with lower doses in patients concurrently being treated with a diuretic Use with caution in patients with renal artery stenosis (bilateral or solitary kidney) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 136 of 159 Monitor potassium and kidney function closely (e.g., one -to-two weeks after initiation or dose adjustment) Concomitant therapy with potassium -sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or additional RAAS blockers may result in hyperkalemia FDA boxed warning: due to the potential ris k for fetal morbidity and mortality in patients taking an ACEI or ARB during pregnancy, it is recommended that therapy be discontinued prior to conception (if possible) or as soon as a woman becomes pregnant and alternate therapy should be considered ACEIs are contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema on an ACEI; ARB should be use with caution in patients with a history of angioedema on an ACEI due to risk of cross - reactivity ARBs may be considered in patients unable to tolerate an ACEI due t o cough Metformin use warrants caution in patients with CKD ( see Recommendation 16 ) due to the risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin is primarily renally eliminated, and according to the product information, the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of kidney dysfunction. Although the risk is very low (reported as less than 10 cases/100,000 patient -years), the mortality rate associated with metformin -associated lactic acidosis is reported to be approximately 50%. [225] Pooled data from an SR reported no cases of lactic acidosis during 70,490 patient -years of metformin use. [226] Despite prior FDA guidance, nearly half of the trials allowed inclusion of patients with a SCr >1.5 mg/dL. One trial in the review, which included patients with renal insufficiency (mean plasma creatinine 1.5 -2.5 mg/dL) and at least one contraindication to metformin, reported no cases of lactic acidosis. [227] According to updated FDA guidance, metformin is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2), while initiation is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 -45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, and risk/benefit of continuing metformin should be assessed if eGFR falls b elow 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2).[83] Temporary discontinuation of metformin at the time of, or prior to , intravascular iodinated radiocontrast should be considered due to the risk of lactic acidosis. [83] In addition to Recommendations 16 -19 of CPG, Appendix B: Pharmacotherapy in the VA/DoD DM CPGa may also be consulted for further guidance on diabetes management (e.g., pertaining to alpha -glucosidase inhibitors, metformin, DPP patients with CKD and other comorbid diseases may be at a higher risk than others for drug toxicity. [228] For example, patients with DM, advanced age and volume depletion (or sta tes of effective volume depletion) may be at increased risk for nephrotoxicity. Concomitant use of multiple nephrotoxic drugs or medications with the potential for drug interactions are also of concern. Repeated and frequent use of higher doses of nephroto xic drugs may increase risk of kidney damage; however, specific data are lacking. Review of the medication list in patients with CKD and medication dose adjustment is essential to the optimal care of these patients. Clinical decisions regarding the use of a particular medication and dose a See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care. Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/cd/diabetes/index.asp VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 137 of 159 adjustments should consider not only the patient's renal function, but also the severity of and alternative therapies for the underlying condition for which the drug was prescribed. Agents with wide therapeutic indices or less potential for adverse effects are preferred. When prescribing medications to patients with CKD, start at a lower dose and then gradually titrate the medication upward. When available, monitoring of drug levels or other clinical parameters (blood sugar and heart rate) should also be conducted. Currently, there are limited data that address measures to improve safety and reduce the risk of adverse drug events due to nephrotoxic or renally -cleared medications, including prescription drugs, over -the- counter medications, and nutritional or herbal supplements for patients with CKD. [229] The utility of a pharmacovigilance system to reduce adverse drug events in CKD should be the subject of future research.VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 138 of 159 Appendix L: Pain Ma nagement in CKD Research on optimal pain management in patients with CKD is lacking, so guidelines established for the general population, like the World Health Organization three -step analgesic ladder, may be adapted for patients with CKD.[ 230] Specifically, caution with the use of certain medications in patients with CKD should be exercised. [231] Knowledge of potential risk of nephrotoxicity (Appendix K ) as well as drug pharmacokinetics is paramount in determining the optimal pain man agement strategy in patients with CKD. For mild pain, non- pharmacologic measures and non- opioid medications are recommended, with considered the first -line pharmacotherapy. Oral and parenteral NSAIDs are generally not recommended in patients with CKD. NSAIDs, including COX -2 inhibitors, have been associated with drug- induced kidney injury in patients with normal kidney function as well as in patients with CKD. [222, 232,233] NSAIDs may cause kidney damage due to rev ersible reductions in renal blood flow as well as idiosyncratic reactions, such as interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis and glomerulopathy. [228, recurrence of NSAID -induced nephrotic syndrome with topical analgesics. Systemic absorption of these agents has also been described with topical NSAIDs, and thus their use cannot be routinely recommended in patients with CKD. Despite the risk of nephrotoxicity, NSAID use is common in patients with CKD. In one survey of more than 12,000 adults in the U.S., current use (defined as nearly every day for >30 days) was reported in 2.5% and 5% of the patients with mild and moderate -to-severe CKD, respectively. Surprisingly , whether or not patients with CKD were aware that their disease was not associated with reduced use of NSAIDs, 66% of patients with moderate -to-severe CKD reported using NSAIDs for one year or longer, despite the fact that NSAID avoidance is recommended by most nephrologists. [235] Because some NSAIDs may be obtained without a prescription, it is important that providers obtain a thorough medication history, including an accurate assessment of NSAID use, provide education on the risk versus benefit of use, and recommend alternate therapies, as indicated. If NSAID use is required, strategies to mitigate risk of NSAID nephrotoxicity include correcting volume depletion before initiating therapy, maintaining euvolemia during therapy, minimizing NSAID dose and duration, consideration of topical rather than oral or parenteral NSAIDs , and routinely monitoring renal function (if chronic use is unavoidable ).[228, 234] For moderate or severe pain, opioids m ay be indicat ed. However, as many opioids and/or their metabolites are renally excreted, the risk of overdose or toxicity is increased in patients with renal dysfunction. Accumulation of normeperidine (an active metabolite of meperidine) may cause central nervous system toxicity, including inducing psychosis and decreasing the seizure threshold, so meperidine is contraindicated in CKD .[230] Codeine and morphine are metabolized to toxic compounds, and severe respiratory depression and narcolepsy have been reported in patients with renal failure , so caution must be used in patients with renal dysfunction. [231] Similarly, impaired renal function res ults in decreased tramadol excretion, but tramadol is not metabolized to nephrotoxic metabolites so may be preferred. Opiates primarily metabolized in the liver such as oxycodone, fentanyl, and methadone, may be useful, but adjustment of the dose or dosing frequency is still recommended. [236] Finally, the risk of opioid dependence should be carefully assessed to mitigate the risk of opioid- related adverse events, including overdose . Providing naloxone rescue and/or referral to long -term discontinuation program should be VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 139 of 159 considered in those on chronic opioid therapy . Providers should refer to the VA/DoD Management of Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain CPG for further information .a Adjunctive medications may be beneficial, particularly for neuropathic pain. Gabapentinoids, anticonvulsants and TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline) work via different mechanisms and are efficacious for management of chronic pain syndromes. Anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine, valproate) may be associated with hematologic abnormalities and hepatic toxicity, while TCAs are associated with anticholinergic side effects (e.g., dry mouth, urinary retention) and cardiotoxicity. G abapentinoids are relatively well -tolerated, so may be preferred; however, both gabapentin and pregabalin are renally excreted, so dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal dysfunction .[237] Use of adjunctive medications in conjunction with non- opioids and opioids may not only improve overall control of pain but may also reduce opioid requirement. Use of n on-pharmacologic measures may be efficacious for certain types of pain and avoid s the potential for nephrotoxicity or other adverse effects related to impaired drug clearance in patients with renal dysfunction. Non- pharmacologic therapies include transcutaneous electrical stimulation, topical thermal therapy, ultrasound st imulation, acupuncture, chiropractic manipulation, massage or rehabilitation programs, biofeedback , and psychotherapy. [237] As with all patients, assessment of etiology of pain, utility of non -pharmacologic measures and managing patient expectations are key. Determining cause of pain may help to establish the most effective type of therapy, urgency for pain control and expected duration of therapy. Additionally, goals of pain management should be discussed and established with the patient. The lowest effective dose of opioids should be used in combination with non- opioids and non- pharmacologic therapies to achieve therapeutic goals. Importantly, the efficacy of pain control and presence of side effects should be routinely assessed and adjustments made to any pain regimen as needed. a See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Ma nagement of Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain . Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/Pain/cot/ VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 140 of 159 Appendix M: Military occupational exposures and CKD Military personnel have unique environmental and occupational exposures, some of which have been associated with kidney disease. Contact with tactical herbicides (e.g., Agent Orange) was identified as an occupational exposure concern in the Vietnam War era. Authoritative reviews have endorsed the association of dioxin -cont aining herbicides with the development of malignancy, including Hodgkin and non- Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and other B -cell lymphomas. In addition, exposure has been linked to non- cancer effects such as DM and hypertension. [238] Kidney disease may be a secondary outcome of exposures because of malignancy o r DM. More recently, garrison exposures ( i.e., exposure of personnel to environmental toxins occurring on U.S. military installations during normal training) has been raised as a military occupational health concern. The finding of garrison ground water contaminated by potentially hazardous chemicals (e.g., perchloroethylene [PCE], trichloroethylene [TCE], vinyl chloride [VC], and benzene) resulted in legislation in 2012 extending cost -free healthcare (or reimbursements for out of pocket expenses) to qualified Veterans and their dependents affected by 15 specific health conditions, including kidney toxicity and kidney cancer.[ 239] A Final Rule in 2017 went further to established presumptive service -connection for Veterans with any of eight conditions, including kidney and/or bladder cancer. [239] Military occupational exposure to airborne hazards is another area of active investigation. [240] Airborne hazards include particulate matter (PM) and gaseous air pollutants arising from a variety of sources (e.g., burn pits, fuel combustion, explosions, dust/sand, a ircraft engine exhaust, aqueous fire -fighting foams). Nearly 50 compounds have been deemed \"chemicals of interest\" with the potential for long -term health effects. Twelve identified pollutants target the kidney, resulting in kidney cancer, renal tubular degeneration , and nephropathy in animal studies. [238] While previous studi es offer limited evidence for military airborne hazard exposure and the development of kidney disease, the health effects of repeated exposure, and exposure to combinations of airborne toxins, remain undefined. [238] More recent non - military population- based evidence reinforces the association of exposure to air pollutants with CKD. [241] Therefore, a history of airborne exposures should be sought. We suggest that providers take a detailed military occupational history from each patient newly diagnosed with CKD, perform an environmental exposure assessment, and document the history and findings. The VA War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) is a good resource for additional details of the evidence for health risks following garrison exposures, airborne hazards, herbicides, and biological and radiation exposures ( www.warrelatedillness.va.gov ) as well as information on evaluating Veterans with environmental exposure concerns (https://www.warrelatedillness.va.gov/education/factsheets/evaluating -veterans -with -environmental - exposure -concerns.pdf ). For a patient with environmental hazard exposure and unexplained CKD despite local evaluation, an inter- facility consultation with the WRIISC may be warranted. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 141 of 159 Appendix N: Nephrolithiasis Nephrolithiasis is a common occurrence affecting up to 10.6 % of people in the United States. [242] Any history of a kidney stone results in a diagnosis of CKD because recurrent obstruction can lead to progressive kidney disease. Passing a kidney stone can be quite painful, and urgent treatment by a radiologist or urologist may be advised, particularly for patients with urosepsis, AKI , evidence of obstruction, or intractable pain. Urologists treat active stones with a variety of procedures such as cystoscopy with stone extraction, lithotripsy, laparoscopic stone retrieval, and stent placement. However, most patients with acute renal colic may be managed medically with analgesics, hydration and alpha- blockers until the stone passes. The likelihood that a stone will spontaneously pass or not is dependent on stone size and location. Nephrologists do little for active stones, but can provide therapy to prevent future stones from forming. Medical therapy for stone prevention should be directed at the type of stones the patient forms and any metabolic etiology identified. If possible, stones should be sent for analysis. In recurrent stone formers there may be a benefit in obtaining a 24 -hour urine stone risk profile with referral to a kidney stone specialist to determine treatment. All patients with history of nephrolithiasis should be educated on non - pharmacologic measures to prevent future stone formation. Drinking enough water to form at least two liters of urine per day is recommended. Though the two most common stones are calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, restriction of dietary calcium is not recommended. Instead, a low -sodium diet, in addition to a high water intake, will reduce urinary calcium excretion and may be useful in preventing a recurrence for the majority of kidney stone formers. Further treatment depends on the results of stone analysis or 24 -hour urine stone risk profile and may include use of a thiazide diuretic for hypercalciuria, potassium citrate urinary alkalization for cy stine stones. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Diseas e September 2019 Page 142 of 159 Appendix O: Gadolinium Gadolinium is an element that is used to enhance MRI . Because it is a heavy metal, gadolinium requires a binding agent to make it both soluble as well as non- toxic. Gadolinium with a binding agent is called a gadolinium binding contrast agent (GBCA). Before 2006, GBCAs were thought to be safe. Excessive doses of GBCAs were used for MRI studies and GBCAs were also used in place of iodinated contrast agents for radiocontrast enhancement in order to prevent radiocontrast -induced nephropathy in patients with CKD. In 2006, Grobner reported the association of GBCAs with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), an irreversible systemic fibrotic in dialysis patients. [243] NSF is a systemic fibrotic dis ease seen only in patients with kidney dysfunction who received GBCAs. There is a paucity of recent studies to understand NSF or the mechanism of injury because there are no new cases and animal models are limited. All older data exist in the form of retrospective observational studies. Risk factors for NSF include severe renal dysfunction, dialysis dependence, AKI, liver transplant, hepatorenal syndrome, and the type and dose of GBCA. The risk of NSF increases with cumulative doses of GBCAs. There are seve ral different GBCAs. The GBCAs with the highest risk for NSF are linear non -ionic binders. Cyclic and ionic GBCAs have a lower risk of causing NSF. There are few or no non -confounded cases of NSF with some of the lower risk GBCAs, but this may have been related to market share so there is still a concern for NSF with these GBCAs. [244] Once the link between GBCA, kidney disease, and NSF was made, measures to mitigate NSF were instituted. GBCA doses were reduced, GBCAs were no longer used as a radiocontrast agent in patients with CKD, high- risk GBCAs were replaced with lower- risk GBCAs, and patients on dialysis or with severe kidney dysfunction were restricted from receiving GBCAs. With these changes, no further cases of NSF have been reported. Physicians should consider using alternative imaging for patients with CKD stage 4 -5, transplant recipients, dialysis patients, and patients with AKI. It is not clear if iodinated contrast poses a higher risk for patients with CKD stage 4 or 5 than a GBCA. If a GBCA is determined to be necessary, the lowest dose should be used, and repeated doses should be avoided. High risk GBCAs (linear non- ionic) should not be used. Further research should be done to see if there are specific types of GBCA agents that could be used safely in patients with reduced kidney function.
