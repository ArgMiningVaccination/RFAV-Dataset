Adapted vaccines are intended to provide broader protection against different virus variants following initial vaccination. Companies marketing originally authorised vaccines can apply to change the [marketing authorisation](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation) to include an adapted version, which is shown in italics in the 30/03/2023 For more information on how EMA evaluated these vaccines, see: The following treatments can be used in the EU on how EMA fast-tracks its evaluation of promising potential COVID-19 medicines, see: The overview below summarises the characteristics of the COVID-19 vaccines authorised in the EU: - Platforms - the type of technology used to develop the vaccine - Strains - the type of virus the vaccine targets, i.e. 'wild-type' (original), a variant or a sub-variant of the virus - Use - whether the vaccine is for primary or for booster vaccination - Population - which age groups the vaccine is used in This overview also details the composition of COVID-19 vaccines and the milestones for authorisation of adapted vaccines.

This enables the detection of any rare side effects that may emerge once many millions of people are vaccinated. Safety information on each COVID-19 vaccine is available: Information on ongoing [clinical trials](/en/glossary/clinical-trial) for COVID-19 treatments in the European Economic Area (EEA) is available in the EU [Clinical Trials](/en/glossary/clinical-trial) Register (EU CTR): Users can find information on: - phase II to phase IV adult [clinical trials](/en/glossary/clinical-trial)for COVID-19 treatments where the investigator sites are in the EEA; - any [clinical trials](/en/glossary/clinical-trial)in children with investigator sites in the EU and any trials that form part of a [paediatric investigation plan](/en/glossary/paediatric-investigation-plan), including those where the investigator sites are outside the EU. Phase I [clinical trials](/en/glossary/clinical-trial) conducted solely in adults are not made publicly available in the EU CTR.
