Those principles include the healing power of nature, finding the true cause of ailments, treating the whole person, prevention, and education. Treatment options in naturopathic medicine can range from lifestyle and diet changes to botanical medicine, from physical medicine to counseling. Treatments may also include prescription medications and even referrals to a specialist in order to provide the best possible care and treatment plan. [Massage Therapy](https://www.arizonacollege.edu/all-programs/massage-therapy/), offered at Arizona College, is a form of naturopathic medicine. Massage Therapists use the healing power of touch to improve circulation, bringing oxygen and other nutrients back into the body's tissues, helping their patients reduce stress, relieve muscle tension and pain, increase flexibility and mobility, and clear the lactic acid and waste from the body that can cause pain and stiffness in muscles and joints. A Massage Therapist can assist patients who suffer from a wide variety of health conditions, including back and muscle pain, inflammatory conditions, stress-related conditions, circulatory and respiratory problems, post-injury and surgical rehabilitation, and more.
