Our founders, Drs. Connie and Marcel Hernandez, were leaders in the campaign that licensed naturopathic doctors in the State of California. They have also mentored many medical students and doctors who sought them out for insights and protocols. We look forward to welcoming you to our practice.

Dr. Connie writes.... \"In my work, I have been enriched by encounters with patients, inspired by colleagues and teachers I admire and respect, and supported by friends near and far. I offer my gratitude to each of them, and am grateful also for the service that each one of them uniquely offers to the world. I am confident that those of you who have been drawn to my work will be inspired by the visions, projects and services of the wonderful people with whom I am currently working. In this age of interconnectedness, let us weave a web of caring, co-operation, and conscious community.\" Adjunctive Cancer Care, Intravenous Therapies, Men's Health, Digestive Issues, Immune System Enhancement, General Naturopathic Medicine Dr. Marcel's expertise is in adjunctive cancer care, chronic illness, men's health, immune system enhancement and digestive disturbances.

Jane Hernandez, CCHT Clinical Hypnotherapy, EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques), Reiki, Energy Healing Jane focuses on helping people change limiting subconscious beliefs that are holding them back. She uses Hypnotherapy and EFT Tapping to heal and reprogram the subconscious. For the first part of her life, Jane was a film and video producer in New York and San Francisco. While the work was creative and engaging, she felt that something essential was missing. When she allowed herself to open to new paths, it became clear that what she was seeking was energy healing through Hypnotherapy and EFT. Jane was initially attracted to Hypnotherapy through a personal event in which she was able to transform a negative belief to a positive action. She had found herself in a trough of procrastination and negative thought and was totally stuck. But after 6 hypnosis sessions everything changed for her. Up until then, hypnotherapy had been merely a curiosity. Now she knew that the subconscious mind is the most powerful source of what we believe and, thus, how we behave. Jane's focus is helping people change subconscious limiting beliefs that are holding them back. In addition to Hypnotherapy, she uses EFT Tapping (Emotional Freedom Techniques). These modalities enable us to heal and reprogram the subconscious, to create lasting change in our lives. We each have the knowledge of the universe within us and when we find the inner path to that knowledge, we can open up great possibilities. Finding the path to your subconscious can help you have more control over your life. Whether it's anxiety, stress, weight, pain, phobias, trauma, pre-surgery fears, low self-esteem, smoking, and many other issues, you can find relief and healing. During the hypnosis and EFT sessions you become a co-healer and that enables change outside of your sessions with her. Jane has offices in Mountain View and El Cerrito. In addition, she is increasingly conducting sessions online and by telephone. Marisa Miranda is a patient care coordinator and office manager at Pacific Naturopathic. She is also a medical technician and assists Dr. Marcel in the intravenous therapy program. Anna Highsmith is also a patient care coordinator. She is a firm believer in naturopathic medicine and its holistic, integrated approach to lifelong wellness. Ardell Hill Ardell Hill is a thermographic technician at Pacific Naturopathic. She is also a specialist in Reiki and several types of massage and bodywork. Our Philosophy Your patient experience at Pacific Naturopathic is unique and transformational. Impersonal, generic medicine has no place here. Soothing colors, a lovely environment and a warm and caring staff set the mood for your healing. The moment you enter into our office, you'll feel welcomed into our clinic family. Relax, have a cup of tea, and know that you are in good hands. You are part of our extended family. Our patients tell us they appreciate the \"country doctor\" relationship they have with us. They also love they the way we integrate the holistic use of conventional medicine, with all its benefits of science and technology, with evidence-based traditional medicine. Naturopathic doctors were the first functional medicine doctors and our profession continues to set the standards in the field. Your health and well-being are our utmost priorities. We are not exclusively tied into one medical system. Our naturopathic approach encompasses the most appropriate forms of medicine that will be most efficacious for your specific condition. Our naturopathic doctors and associated healers use herbs, homeopathy, vitamins, minerals, enzymes and naturally-derived prescriptive medicines as necessary, in order to provide the best care possible. We believe all forms of medicine have their place and value. We know your name. You are seen. You are heard. You are a person, not a disease. We spend time with you and tune in to your health concerns and the forces that shape your life. There are no five-minute visits at Pacific Naturopathic. You receive the time and personalized health care you need to achieve your health goals. We listen to you. It's your story and your health. You are more than a compendium of lab results. Profound and lasting health is not written on a prescription pad. We will partner with you to look after your health. We make sure you truly understand what's happening. We believe an informed patient makes better choices about health and wellness. You are an active participant in creating freedom from illness and developing total, vibrant well-being. We follow the path together. Is Naturopathic Medicine Right for You? The goal of naturopathic medicine has always been to discover and treat the underlying cause of imbalance or disease, whether that cause be physical, mental, emotional or spiritual. Trained as general family practitioners and in specialties, naturopathic doctors evaluate your health through comprehensive health history and lifestyle evaluation, physical examination, and ever more sophisticated conventional and cutting-edge laboratory testing. Today's functional medicine specialists now emulate the naturopathic goal of seeking and treating the cause of distress. In Gratitude "}
