Dr. Mao has lectured internationally and has been featured on radio and television as well as on the pages of the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and many other publications. For more information: visit [www.askdrmao.com](http://www.askdrmao.com) About this Book Secrets of Longevity is full of surprising, all-natural ideas for living a longer, healthier, and happier life. As a 38th generation doctor specializing in longevity, Dr. Mao (as he's known to his patients) knows the answers \u2014 and they're surprisingly simple and powerful. It's amazing how a little honey in your tea can aid internal healing. Or how taking a walk after dinner each night can reduce the risk of stroke and heart disease. The tips are organized into chapters on diet, healing, environment, exercise, and relationships, so you can easily dip into the areas you'd like to address. Marrying wisdom from the East with the latest scientific advances from the West, Secrets of Longevity puts at your fingertips a whole host of ways to make your stay on earth longer, healthier, and much, much happier. Review Secrets of Longevity by Dr. Maoshing Ni is the most original and creative book on health I have ever found. While the book is based on research conducted in China back in 1985 on elders, among them many centenarians, the style in which the book is written is all but a scholarly treatise. In fact, Dr. Mao found a way to present the material in a highly interesting manner, a page per topic or just half a page, and topics there are many. While one may suspect that here the 'right brain' prevails as the overall approach, giving the reader morsels of wisdom 'in a nutshell,' this style doesn't neglect order and structure. To be precise, the book is complete in every respect, with six chapters that present clearly defined topics, a Resource section, a Bibliography, and an Index. As Dr. Mao writes about the research he conducted in the Introduction \u2014 quoted below \u2014 let me give an overview here over the chapter contents: Chapter 1: What You Eat: Diet and Nutrition Chapter 2: How You Heal: Herbs, Remedies, and Elixirs Chapter 3: Where You Are: Environment, Ecology, and Community Chapter 4: What You Do: Exercise, Lifestyle, and Rejuvenation Chapter 5: Who You Are: Genetics, Relationships, Love, Sexuality, and Faith Chapter 6: Bringing it All Together: Achieving a Fulfilling Life and Personal Legacy Like Dr. Mao's other books which I review here, this is a 5-star bestselling book that is in every respect up to the task of promoting an alternative lifestyle which is healthy, wistful, down-to-earth, avoiding extremes of any kind \u2014 so often to be found in this trendy publishing niche called 'nutritional advice' \u2014 and combining age-old Eastern wisdom teachings with cutting-edge scientific research results. The book is also an aesthetic enjoyment with its eco-design look and the light green font color and corresponding page frames. Introduction, by Dr. Maoshing Ni Who among us doesn't want to live a long life? The desire to survive is built into us. As animals, we react instinctively to protect ourselves in the face of danger. As organisms, our bodies marshal natural defenses to fight off disease and heal injury. As social beings, we fondly hope to observe the new generations as they are born and grow. We all contemplate the seemingly mysterious differences among individuals \u2014 why do some people succumb to age-related syndromes while in their sixties and others live to be well over 100? We ponder the even more mysterious events imputed to 'fate,' when otherwise healthy people die from injuries or environmental affronts to the body. I have had special reason to engage in such musings. An accidental fall from the rooftop of our three-story house when I was six years old left me in and out of a coma for a month and greatly weakened by the trauma. I am lucky that I was born into a medical family. My father was a doctor of Chinese medicine and my mother rehabilitated me and guided me on the long road back to health. I still hold the memory of the herb teas' unpleasant taste, grueling early-morning tai chi and qigong practices, daily acupuncture sessions, meditation disciplines, and special food preparations. The knowledge that made me whole again came from thousands of years of Chinese tradition of healing and rejuvenation, and I vowed that when I got well I would become a doctor and spread this tradition, to which I owed my life. In 1985, while completing my postgraduate residency in Shanghai, I took note of the throngs of seniors converging at local parks every day at dawn to practice energy-enhancement exercises such as tai chi and qigong. I interviewed many of these seniors and even examined some of them. A good number were more than 100 years old. I was amazed at their grace and agility, sharp minds, vitality, and overall healthiness. This experience, combined with my recovery from that childhood accident, inspired me to explore a preventive approach to health, and thus began my twenty-year effort on centenarians and the science of longevity. The discoveries I made along the way fill this book. Marrying thousands of years of wisdom from the East with the latest scientific advances from the West, Secrets of Longevity provides time-tested and well-researched advice for achieving a long, healthy, and happy life. To extend your life and improve its quality, you do not need to be in good health already. In other words, do not fret about the past. What you do from this moment on is what matters. The good news is that you can positively affect your health and longevity right now. The causes of aging-related ills range from genetically pre-programmed cell death to destruction by environmental toxins to plaque and fibers that clog up the highways within our bodies. We all possess genes that are triggered as a result of how we live our life and the environment we are exposed to. Longevity is a matter of whether we express our good or bad genetic predisposition during our lifetime. Unfortunately, Western society doesn't make it easy to increase our longevity potential. Our youth-driven culture and our neglect of the aged promote a wholesale denial of the realities of aging. The marketplace is full of products and devices promising to make us look and feel younger. In addition, conventional Western medicine focuses on treatment and replacement therapy, prescribing expensive drugs, removing a failed organ and transplanting a new one, or replenishing a depleted hormone. Very little emphasis has been placed on preventing disease and maintaining a vigorous state of health day to day. In contrast, prevention and wellness have always been at the heart of Eastern medicine. Eastern doctors have long viewed disease as a symptom of life being out of balance. Therefore, the medicine they practice seeks to enhance and optimize health through diet, lifestyle, and emotional well-being. The Eastern paradigm also employs a variety of natural therapies such as acupuncture, herbal therapy, bodywork, tai chi, yoga, and meditation to treat the mind, body, and spirit. This approach empowers each individual in his or her pursuit of health and wellness. Another important aspect of longevity is healing. At some point, due to factors beyond your control, you may become sick. How you handle the illness will have significant bearing on your longevity. Therefore, I recommend that you build a team of knowledgeable professionals dedicated to furthering your health and wellness. Seek our physicians who are willing to integrate complementary medical traditions such as acupuncture and herb remedies and how will take the time to educate you, answer your questions, and guide you in the pursuit of your longevity goals. As you read this book, become more aware of your health and seek treatment at the earliest opportunity \u2014 before a serious disease strikes.

Apple cider vinegar has been a part of the health regimen of centenarians throughout the world. Its ascetic and butyric acids promote gastrointestinal health by balancing pH and encouraging friendly bifido bacterial growth. Vinegar has antiseptic and antibiotic properties; it may also help to reverse atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, and dissolve gall and kidney stones. /38 \u2014 Long known for its antibiotic properties, honey is also much more nutritious than refined table sugar, which lacks the vitamins and minerals natural honey contains. /39 \u2014 Many mushrooms, particularly shiitake, maitake, reishi, and wood ear, have superb anti-aging properties. /40 \u2014 Burdock root is a regular part of the diet among the Japanese, who have the longest life span in the world. /41 \u2014 I suggest using only unrefined sea salt such as that found in the salt beds of Brittany, which has a slightly gray hue. (...) It is also important to balance salt intake with potassium to ensure proper nerve and muscle function; potassium-rich foods include leafy vegetables, soy, whole grains, potatoes, bananas, and most fruits. /44 \u2014 Buy organic, cold-pressed, minimally processed oils at your local health food store, and make sure that you consume it within three months. Olive oil, walnut oil, flaxseed oil, and soy oil are excellent choices. /66 \u2014 The average American consumes nearly 240 pounds of sugar per year. Most of the excess sugar is stored as fat in your body, which elevates cancer risk and can suppress your immune function. When study subjects were given sugar, their white blood cell count decreased significantly for several hours afterwards. This held true for a variety of types of sugar, including fructose, glucose, honey, and orange juice. In another study, rats fed a high-sugar diet had a substantially elevated rate of breast cancer compared to rats on a normal diet. To live long, draw sweetness from other aspects of your life. /67 \u2014 High blood pressure, the plague of the modern age, is the root cause of stroke, heart disease, and kidney failure. An old Chinese remedy for this ailment is to drink celery juice, which you can create in a blender or juicer. (...) In addition, celery seed is renowned for preventing gout and other types of arthritic conditions. Studies show that this stalk contains more than a dozen anti-inflammatory agents ... /69 \u2014 Many health seekers take vitamins and minerals by the handful every day in the belief that they are effective health aids. Often, because of the dietary supplements' low bioavailability \u2014 the absorption factor \u2014 what people consume is excreted from the bladder and bowels without being metabolized. Many vitamins are synthetic, made form petrochemicals that have very little biological activity. The supplements with the highest bioavailability use extracts from organic, whole foods. The best way to take vitamins and minerals is in the form of powdered or liquid concentrates or oils made from bee pollen, barley, wheat grass, kelp, spirulina, chlorophyll, brewer's yeast, bone-meal, wheat germ, flax, and fish oils. /102 \u2014 You should not have plants in your bedroom, because at night they give off carbon dioxide and deplete the oxygen in the air you breathe. /164 \u2014 Activities in our lives can also be categorized as yin or yang. Sleeping, relaxation, reading, and bathing are yin activities, while exercise, cooking, enaging in hobbies, and studying are yang. Therefore, your bedroom and bathroom are more appropriately located in the northern and western parts of your home, and your office, kitchen, living room, and dining room should be in the southern and eastern locations. /165 \u2014 There are reasons why gravity keeps humans close to the ground. For one thing, the higher you are from the surface of the Earth, the less connected you are to the planet's electromagnetic field (EMF). Our bodies' myriad functions are regulated by our own EMF, which pulses to that of the Earth. When this EMF synchronization is disrupted, disease can result. Moreover, when you fly in a place at 30,000 feet, you are bombarded with a level of cosmic radiation similar to one's radiation exposure in a chest x-ray. So whenever possible, live and work no higher than four stories up, and use air travel only when absolutely necessary. /167 \u2014 Nonstick pans contain Teflon, a plastic that in recent years has been linked to immune disorders and possible cancer conditions. If possible, I suggest trading in your current pots and pans for cookware with porcelain enamel coating or made of cast iron, glass, or "}
