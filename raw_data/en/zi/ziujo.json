Admissions Policy The College will admit all applicants who are high school graduates (from a regionally-accredited or state Department of Education recognized school), General Educational Development (GED) recipients, or home schooled students who have completed senior level curriculum. In addition, adults who are not high school graduates will be admitted if they are 18 years of age or older or if they give evidence of being able to benefit from courses offered by the College. Students not meeting any of the previous criteria may be considered for admission on an individual basis. Acceptance to the College does not ensure admission into all academic programs. Students who do not meet the College's academic standards or those who do not meet special admissions requirements will not be accepted into selective programs. Satisfying minimum special program requirements for selective admission programs does not guarantee admission into special programs.Note: State and federal regulations prohibit students who have not earned a high school diploma (from a regionally-accredited or state Department of Education recognized school) or GED from receiving any form of federal or state financial aid. 2How to start . . . Below are the items that must be completed if you intend to earn a degree, certificate or specialized diploma on a full- or part-time basis. 1.

All students must have approval of their school districts. Final decision to admit a concurrent enrollment student rests with the College. Students who are in academic difficulty or have been expelled or dropped out of high school are not eligible for concurrent enrollment.

Placement Policy Placement Policy The college uses multiple measures to determine student placement in English and Mathematics classes. Student placement will be determined by: 1. High School GPA and/or specific course grades in English or Mathematics (completed within 5 years prior to enrolling in first semester at NCC) 2. Performance on testing including PSSA (11th grade), ACT or SAT (PSSA scores are only valid for 5 years) 3. Previous college degrees or courses in English or Mathematics4. Advanced Placement test scores5. NCC Mathematics or English Placement test results If students do not submit evidence from which the college can determine placement, students will be directed to take college placement tests. Based upon review of transcripts or other evidence, students may be placed into developmental pre-college courses. Students wishing to challenge such decisions may take college placement tests to earn scores for higher-level course placement. Students who place into developmental pre-college courses can retest once before starting those courses. Students may not take the test while enrolled in a developmental pre-college course. If students need developmental pre-college work, they must begin that work in their first semester and continue until the requirements are complete. Based upon reading/writing placement testing, students may be required to enroll in College Success/Academic Learning Skills (COLS-/ACLS-) courses as outlined in the Placement Guidelines. Developmental pre-college course work does not count towards graduation requirements. Degree-seeking students must have placement determined before registering for courses.Students pursuing a Specialized Diploma or Certificate should seek guidance from an advisor regarding placement.Guest/Visiting/non matriculated students are exempt from placement; however, must still meet individual course prerequisites.Based on evidence of course work and/or testing, students may be referred to the ESL department for additional testing and placement.Requests for accommodated testing must be submitted through the Office of Disability Services. Placement Guidelines: English, College Success/Academic Learning Skills & Mathematics English English I (ENGL101): Must be a graduate from an accredited high school (within 5 years prior to enrolling in first semester at NCC) with a GPA of 3.00 or higher (on a 4.0 scale or its equivalent) in a college preparatory curriculum Score of 500 or higher on both the SAT Writing and Critical Reading exams (2005 and beyond) Combined Reading and Writing 11th grade PSSA score of at least 2650; with neither Reading nor Writing score below 1200.

Transferring Transferring In Northampton Community College will accept credits when transferring from another institution when the following criteria are met: 1. Credits earned from: U.S. colleges and universities that are regionally accredited. (Coursework from other institutions not regionally accredited will be reviewed on a case by case basis). foreign institutions that are evaluated by a member of a recognized evaluation agency like World Education Services Inc. or Educational Credential Evaluators Inc. and a copy of the evaluation sent directly to NCC. (For more information concerning an evaluation service provider, please contact the NCC Admissions Office). the military provided to the College on the official DD295 form, AARTS, or Joint Services transcript. 2. The course grade is C or better. Courses taken on a pass/fail basis may be accepted only if the official transcript states that a \"pass\" grade is equivalent to a C or above. 3. The course content is equivalent to a Northampton course. 94. The course is applicable to the student's Northampton program. 5. Official transcripts are mailed or sent electronically to the Admissions Office directly from the student's previous college, university, or other post-secondary educational institution. A minimum of 25% of credits required for any degree, certificate or specialized diploma must be earned through NCC course work. Remaining credits may be awarded through transfer or as outlined in the Advanced Placement Policy. Admissions determines transferability of credits for new students and change of majors into the allied health majors; the Registrar determines all other transferability of credits. Transferred credits are recorded at the top of the NCC transcript as \"Transfer Work\". Grades do not transfer; transfer credits have no effect on the Northampton Community College grade point average (GPA). Transfer with a Bachelor's degree A student possessing a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university and enrolling at Northampton in an Associate's degree program shall be considered to have completed the general education core requirements except for required courses identified by the program faculty. Check with Admissions Office for approved list of general education courses transferrable into each program. A student possessing a baccalaureate degree from an institution not regionally accredited will have the credential reviewed on a case by case basis. Transfer Out to Other Institutions More than half of the students at Northampton are enrolled in transfer programs. The College will recommend for transfer those students whose personal qualities and academic achievement indicate that they will succeed at other institutions. Although a C average is usually considered minimal for transfer, the specific average required varies with the selective admissions policy established by each individual institution.The transfer of specific courses normally depends upon appropriateness of completed work to the intended transfer program. Generally, courses completed with a grade of C or better receive transfer credit. The maximum amount of transfer credit varies by college, but normally 60 to 70 credit hours of applicable course work can be transferred. The final decision regarding admission and the acceptability of transfer credit hours rests with the receiving institution. A course-by-course reference guide is available for your use in the Northampton Advising and Transfer Office. The guide indicates how individual NCC courses transfer to many of the four-year institutions in eastern Pennsylvania. Some course guides are on the advising and transfer services web page.The fact that freshman and sophomore requirements vary considerably among senior colleges suggests that students should discuss their transfer plans with both a faculty advisor and an advising specialist, who will help plan a program as near as possible to the requirements of the intended transfer program. Unless there is no doubt that the student will transfer to a particular college, it is generally advisable to take courses at the College which are as close as possible to those offered at those colleges which might be considered for transfer. Articulation Agreements NCC has over 100 articulation agreements with more than 30 colleges and universities. Articulation agreements are signed by two institutions to make the transfer process easier for students. There are several types of articulation agreements that NCC has with various institutions. Most offer the greatest benefit to students who earn an associate degree then transfer to complete a baccalaureate degree. The most common types of agreements are explained below. Dual Admissions Dual Admissions agreements allow students to apply to both NCC and the partner four-year institution. Typically, students are provisionally accepted to the four-year institution provided they meet the admissions criteria outlined in the agreement. Admissions criteria usually require a student to earn an associate degree with a minimum grade point average. Dual admissions agreements are good for students who know before coming to NCC the four-year institution they want to attend. Core-to Core Core-to Core agreements guarantee that credit earned by students who complete an A.A. or A.S. degree at NCC will be accepted towards the core requirements at the four-year institution. Core requirements are the general education portion of a baccalaureate degree. General education requirements vary among institutions. Students benefit from core-to-core agreements because all of the credit earned from the associate degree is applied to the four-year program without evaluating individual courses. Typically, there are also admissions criteria for transfer students outlined in the agreement. Program-to-Program Program-to-Program agreements are designed to map out the curriculum necessary for students to earn an associate degree at NCC and meet the requirements for a corresponding baccalaureate degree at a four-year institution. The agreements stipulate the exact major courses, general education courses, and electives students should take to make a seamless transfer. 10Take your Credits with You Take your Credits with You Pennsylvania has an innovative statewide transfer system that allows up to 30 foundation credits to be transferred from one participating college or university to another, anywhere in the state. pacollegetransfer.com offers all the information you need to make full use of this transfer system.

Students who earn an Associate in Applied (AAS) degree in a technical program at NCC may stay at NCC to complete additional NCC courses that will count towards general education requirements for the BAS. The remaining BU requirements for the BAS will be offered as a mix of evening on-campus courses at NCC and online courses. 11Academic Passport Academic Passport is an agreement between Pennsylvania Community Colleges and the State System of Higher Education (SSHE). It allows community college students who earn an A.A. or A.S. degree with a GPA of 2.0 or higher to be accepted to a SSHE university. It also guarantees the acceptance of up to 60 credits to be applied towards a Baccalaureate degree entitling a student to junior status. The first 45 credits will be used as general education requirements with the additional 15 credits applied to major requirements or electives. Although this agreement allows students to be accepted at the 14 SSHE universities it does not guarantee acceptance to selective admission or enrollment capped programs. Other criteria will be used for these programs. Programs eligible for Academic Passport at NCC are: Biology, Business Administration, Chemistry, Communication Studies, Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, Education, Engineering, Fine Art, General Studies, Individual Transfer Studies, Journalism, Liberal Arts, Math/Physics, Social Work, Sport Management, and Theatre. Universities in the PA State System of Higher Education are: Bloomsburg University of PA California University of PA Cheyney University of PA Clarion University of PA East Stroudsburg University of PA Edinboro University of PA Indiana University of PA Kutztown University of PA Lock Haven University of PA Mansfield University of PA Millersville University of PA Shippensburg University of PA Slippery Rock University of PA West Chester University of PA Individualized Transfer Studies Program The Individualized Transfer Studies program at Northampton is designed for students who have a clear intention to transfer to a specific baccalaureate college. The program is unique in that each student works with the four-year institution and designs a curriculum to meet the specific requirements for the major at the baccalaureate institution. The program consists of a three-part curriculum which includes: The current general education core for the associate in arts (A.A.) programs; The addition of one Humanities and one Social Science to the general electives; The remaining credit hours will align with the requirements at the transfer institution. The Individualized Transfer Program ensures that students take only those courses at NCC which are required by the four-year institution to which they intend to transfer. This option is intended for students who have identified their baccalaureate institution of choice. The student must meet with an advisor at the four-year institution to pre-plan a program of transferable courses. These Northampton courses will fulfill the general distribution requirements and other courses that are required at the four-year institution. This enables students to get a head start on their baccalaureate degree with an associate's degree from Northampton. Program Information All the academic programs within the College are designed to help you meet your goals. Northampton offers programs that will transfer to four-year colleges and universities, as well as those that prepare you to step right into today's competitive work force. At Northampton, all curricula have a general education component that serves as a solid base for your education. In addition, in each academic program, you will find that the majority of courses give you specific skills and training designed to prepare you to meet your transfer or career objectives. The College's faculty are specialists who make teaching their first priority. You'll gain knowledge in your chosen subject area from a combination of classroom lectures, group projects, and hands-on laboratory work. You will also benefit from the expertise of members of our advisory committees, composed of successful individuals from the region who advise the College about particular changes in the workplace. General Education Core Curriculum The General Education Core Curriculum is an essential component of all degree programs. Courses in the Core fall into two broad categories: Knowledge of Arts, Cultures and the Natural World, and Intellectual and Practical Skills. Students are exposed to a broad range of academic disciplines and fields of study in order to provide a strong foundation of content knowledge and intellectual skills. Certificate programs usually require six credits of general education courses. 12Transfer Education Many of Northampton's courses are designed to transfer to four-year institutions; that is, they contain roughly the same material as similar courses at those institutions. Students who intend to continue their education after Northampton should take as many transferable courses as possible within A.A. or A.S. degree programs. The receiving institution ultimately determines the transferability of courses. It is advisable that students consult early with the Admissions Office of the institution to which they plan to transfer. Technical Education Technical education or career education describes a category of courses designed to develop highly skilled graduates prepared for entry-level positions in a particular occupation or group of occupations. Northampton's career education programs, which prepare students for employment immediately upon graduation, usually contain a strong complement of technical education courses. These courses carry credit toward the associate in applied science and associate in general education degrees. They are not designed for transfer. Developmental Education Developmental education helps students learn the skills needed for success in college-level courses. These skills include the essentials of reading, writing, and mathematics, and proven strategies for achieving their academic goals. Developmental education services are provided through these means: Placement testing in math, reading, and English determines the eligibility of students for developmental courses. Some courses numbered below 100 (0XX) are designed to allow students to remedy specific deficiencies in mathematics, reading, and writing. Among them are PreAlgebra, Elementary Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, Reading Fundamentals, Critical Reading, Basic English, and Chemical Calculations. NOTE: While courses below 100 each carry credit for determining student load and for financial aid, those credits may not be applied to any degree or certificate granted by the College. The Learning Center provides tutoring, workshops, and study skills support to promote the academic success of developmental students. Tutoring options include study groups, classroom tutors, Supplemental Instruction, individual appointments, walk-in hours, and online hours. English as a Second Language The College supports English language learners by offering courses for college credit through the English as a Second Language (ESL) Department. Students work toward proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking skills. Course work ranges from the beginner level through the advanced level and prepares students to succeed in other college courses or in communities of their choice. Students are supported with tutoring services, a computerized language lab, and academic advising, all with a special attention to the needs of English language learners. Higher levels of ESL can be taken at the same time as other college courses upon the recommendation of an ESL advisor. Students take an ESL placement test to assist with proper placement into classes. Special Studies and Special Topics Courses In some semesters the College offers special studies courses, of one to four credits, that are designed to give variety to the present curriculum and reflect current interests. Special studies courses are offered by almost all of the College's academic departments. The specific topic to be covered is announced at the time a special studies course is scheduled, along with any applicable enrollment requirements or prerequisites. Up to 12 credits of special studies courses may be applied to a student's program, insofar as they fit into the program requirements. (A special studies course may be repeated if a different specific topic is offered.) Special studies courses that are later approved as on-going courses in substantially the same form will not be counted toward the 12-credit limit. Tuition Schedule Tuition and fees for full-time students registered for 12 to 18 credit hours are charged at a flat rate. Tuition and fees for part-time students registered for less than 12 credit hours are charged at a per-credit hour rate. Additional credit hours over 18 are charged at a per-credit hour rate.

Senior Citizens In-county residents who are 65 years of age or older qualify for a tuition and fee waiver for credit courses (noncredit does not qualify for a waiver). The waiver must be requested by the student at the time of registration. A valid PA Photo ID or PA Driver's License is also required. Note: Waiver is provided for tuition, comprehensive fee, technology fee and capital fee only. Academic course fees, textbooks and other expenses that may be required for course completion are not included and are the responsibility of the student. Tuition and Fee Waiver plus other forms of financial aid awards and/or third-party payments received on behalf of the student cannot exceed tuition and eligible fee charges and if so, will reduce the Tuition and Fee Waiver accordingly. Students in CULA 145 & 150 who are on the dining service meal plan may have their meal plan fee waived. Course Drop, Withdrawal, Refunds, Class Changes, and Adjustments Students who wish to drop or withdraw from either a course or the College must receive official authorization from the Records Office. Failure to drop or withdraw officially may result in the recording of an F grade. A student who is asked to leave the College for misconduct or delinquent attendance will receive no refund of tuition or fees. Students who drop with the approval of the Records office prior to the beginning of a semester and the date specified in the College Calendar, will be entitled to a 100 percent refund (or adjustment) of tuition and fees charged, less the non-refundable admissions deposit and any amounts owed 15 to the College for fines, returned checks and other charges and fees. In addition, a student who drops during the following specified periods will be entitled to the applicable refund (or adjustment) of tuition and fees, less the admissions deposit, student fees, and any amounts owed to the College per the schedule below. Specified dates for each semester are listed in the College Calendar. All refund payments will be made payable to the student except for a) contractual third party payments - refund payable to the third party named, and b) excess parents plus loan funds - refund payable to the parent named Refund Rates 75% - First week of class or equivalent for non-standard session 50% - Second week of class or equivalent for non-standard session 25% - Third week of class or equivalent for non-standard session * A standard session is considered as 15 weeks. No refund is given after the third week of class * Beginning with the Fall 2013 Semester, full-time tuition and fees are not refundable for students who drop but still remain registered within the 12 - 18 full-time credit hour block Room and Board A separate refund schedule applies to housing and meal plan charges. This schedule is published in the Residence Life Handbook and made available to students in the Office of Student Activities and Housing. Please note that a drop or withdrawal does not absolve a student's financial responsibility for his/her educational expenses. The student is responsible for payment of charges outstanding after the drop or withdrawal is processed and charges are adjusted. Special Note to Financial Aid Recipients In accordance with federal and state guidelines, a drop or withdrawal may reduce a student's financial aid award. As a result, the student may owe a balance to the College. Any amounts owed after adjustment of the financial aid award is billed to the student. In the event of serious injury or illness which is certified by a physician, the student will be granted a full tuition credit, if that documentation is received at the time the student withdraws from the College. Such credit may be applied toward tuition costs only upon his or her return to the College. This credit will be cancelled if it is not used within a one-year period after the student has taken leave from the institution. Tuition credit will not be granted if a student received academic credit from courses in which he or she is enrolled. Students called to involuntary active military duty may be eligible for a full tuition credit or full tuition refund upon receipt of the appropriate application and supporting documentation as specified at the time of withdrawal. Tuition refunds are subject to financial aid regulations. Financial Obligation Payment for tuition and fees is due, in full, by the semester tuition due date published in the academic calendar. Financial aid must be pending on the student account to be deducted from the balance due on the tuition and fees bill. Expected financial aid that is not pending by the tuition due date may not be deducted. In order to receive a refund or adjustment of charges, a student must complete an official course drop during the stated refund periods. Failure to formally drop your classes during the refund period may cause you to be financially responsible for 100% of all charges. Nonattendance does not relieve you of your financial obligation. The college reserves the right to cancel a student's registration if payment is not received by the tuition due date, however, this action is not guaranteed and students who are not dropped retain their registration status and remain 100% responsible for payment as charged. Students must complete a course drop by the refund deadline to ensure they are not held responsible for payment of tuition and fees. Students who are dropped for nonpayment will be required to pay a $10 per credit hour reinstatement fee for subsequent registration in that session. Students with outstanding financial obligations to Northampton Community College (NCC) including but not limited to tuition, fees, room and board, library materials, fines, loaned equipment, will have a hold on their account and may not be permitted to register for a subsequent semester, receive official transcripts or grades, or participate in graduation until the hold is cleared. NCC makes every attempt to contact each student to arrange satisfactory payment of the outstanding amount. If we have exhausted all efforts available to us and the debt is still outstanding, the unpaid account is referred to a private collection agency and reported to the national credit bureau systems. After an account has been referred to private collection, the student is responsible for payment of all collection costs and attorney fees in addition to the original debt owed to NCC. Payment arrangements for amounts in collection must be made directly with the appropriate collection agency. Tuition Payment Plan NCC offers a tuition payment plan option that spreads payment for tuition, fees, room and board throughout the semester. Enrollment in the payment plan is due as follows: Fall - July 15 Spring - December 15 16Summer I - April 15 Summer II - April 15 * Late enriollment with additional down payment is available. Re-enrollment must be repeated each semester. Contact the bursar's office for additional information. Financial Aid Since its founding, Northampton Community College has been committed to offering excellence in education at a moderate cost. While NCC adheres to the principle that students and their families have the primary responsibility to pay for college costs as their means permit, financial assistance programs represent a bridge between a family's ability to pay and the cost of higher education. Last year, the College awarded over $44 million in financial assistance to approximately 7,600 full and part-time students. The NCC Financial Aid Office administers many types of financial assistance including federal, state, private and institutional financial aid programs to help students meet their educational costs. Most financial aid awards are made on the basis of financial need. A student's financial need is determined by deducting the student's expected family contribution (EFC) from the cost of education. To qualify for financial aid, you must demonstrate financial need while maintaining academic progress. Financial aid awards must be applied to educational expenses such as tuition, fees, books, room, board, supplies, transportation or other educational costs. Financial aid awards may consist of grants and/or scholarships (funds which do not have to be repaid), loans (low interest loans which require little or no payment while a student is attending college on at least a half-time basis), employment (money which a student earns through work either on or off-campus) or a combination of these sources. Foundation Scholarships To encourage and assist students, NCC also offers scholarships from over 200 different scholarship funds for students who meet the awards' requirements. Funds for scholarship assistance are provided through the efforts of the Northampton Community College Foundation and the generosity of alumni, community leaders, local employers and friends of the College. The NCC Foundation, established in 1969 as a private, non-profit corporation to support educational programs and activities that cannot be funded through the College's regular income sources, enables NCC to provide more private scholarship support than any other community college in Pennsylvania. Students must complete the financial aid application process to be considered for scholarship support How to Apply for Financial Aid To apply for financial aid at Northampton Community College a student must: Complete and submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) via the Web at www.fafsa.gov. A student and parent can create an FSA ID to electronically sign the FAFSA. NCC's Federal Code for the FAFSA is 007191 New students should not wait to be admitted to NCC before applying for financial aid. Returning students must annually reapply for financial aid for each academic year a student wants to be considered for financial aid. The Northampton Community College financial aid priority application deadline is March 31st. Students who complete their financial aid application by the priority deadline will be notified of their eligibility for aid before tuition is due for the following Fall semester. The priority application deadline for the Spring semester is October 1st of the previous year. While financial aid applications are accepted throughout the year, it is important to meet the priority application deadlines if a student expects financial aid to help pay his/her semester tuition and fee charges by the tuition due date. Eligibility To receive aid, a student must meet the following eligibility requirements: 1. Be a United States citizen or eligible non-citizen with a valid social security number;2. Be enrolled in an eligible academic program;3. A high school graduate or have a recognized General Equivalency Diploma (GED);4. Be an undergraduate student who has not previously earned a bachelor's degree (for most types of aid);5. Not be in default on any previous student loan nor owe a repayment on an adjusted federal grant;6. If male and age 18-25, be registered for Selective Service7. Comply with Northampton Community College's Academic Progress Policy requirements. Student Employment NCC offers on and off-campus jobs to students who have financial need through the Federal Work Study Program. A student's earnings under this program are not credited to the student's account, but are paid to the student every two weeks. Students are responsible for securing their job by interviewing with the job's supervisor. A list of available positions can be found on the Work Study link on the Financial Aid page of the NCC Web site. Students who are interested in community service positions should contact the Work Study Coordinator in the Financial Aid Office. 17Veteran's Benefits We are proud to be a Veterans Administration (VA) approved Institution of Higher Learning (IHL). All associate degree, specialized diploma, and certificate programs listed in the NCC College Catalog are deemed approved by the VA for receipt of education benefits. Our Student Veterans Services Office offers assistance as a resource for VA, military funding for education, EAP, FTA, MYCAA and handles certification of enrollment to the VA for Montgomery GI Bill, Post 9/11 GI Bill, and other VA education benefit programs. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Student Veterans Services of enrollment, changes in enrollment, termination of student status or changes of address and phone number. Failure to do this could delay or jeopardize current or future benefits. A Military Veterans and Service Members Student Checklist and Veteran's Benefits Request Form (VBRF) are available online at www.northampton.edu/academic-programs/veterans.htm . Questions may be directed to the Student Veterans Services Office at 610.861.5508. Federal Financial Aid Academic Progress Policy All students must be making satisfactory academic progress toward a degree, certificate or specialized diploma in order to establish or renew eligibility for participation in any of the Federal or State financial aid programs. The Higher Education Act requires institutions to establish academic progress standards that contain qualitative and quantitative measurements of progress. The act also requires a maximum time frame for completion of the program. The provisions included in Northampton's academic progress policy are based on federal requirements and are applicable to all students applying for federal aid including the Federal Parent Loan (PLUS). Copies of the policy and the appeal procedure are available at the Financial Aid Office and are distributed to all financial aid recipients with their financial aid award letter. This policy applies to any student entering or returning to NCC. A student's entire academic record is reviewed even when a student was not a financial aid recipient during prior enrollment. College approved academic restarts are not considered when computing financial aid satisfactory academic progress. The following requirements must be met for eligibility for federal financial aid (grants, loans, and work-study). Only courses required for your current major are eligible for financial aid consideration. I. Completion Rate A student must successfully complete sixty-seven percent (67%) of all credits attempted at NCC.Financial aid can be applied only once to repeat any course where the student received a passing grade, including a \"D\". Although students may receive financial aid for repeated courses, credit for a course is given only once. II. Grade Point Average A student must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average based on the total number of credits attempted including transfer credits. Total credits attempted include courses in which a student receives a passing grade or F, W, WP, WF, N, or I. Total Credits Attempted Including Transfer CreditsMinimum Cumulative GPA Required 9-25 1.50 26-40 1.75 41+ 2.00 III. Maximum Time Frame For federal financial aid eligibility students must complete their program within a maximum time frame not to exceed 150% of the length of the educational program. This includes all semesters of enrollment even if no aid was received. Once a student attempts more than 150% of the credits that it normally takes to complete his/her program of study, he/she is no longer eligible for financial aid. Example: Length of Program Maximum Time Frame 60-credit program 90 credits attempted30-credit program 45 credits attempted Questions about this policy should be directed to the Financial Aid Office (610.861.5510). Appeal Process Students who do not meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements have the right to appeal. All appeals must be in writing and must be submitted within 45 days of the date of the notice of denial. Appeal forms should be submitted to the Financial Aid Office at Northampton Community College, 3835 Green Pond Road, Bethlehem, PA 18020. An appeal should include an explanation of the extenuating circumstances which resulted in the student's inability to meet the requirements. Information about the student's plan to make up any deficiencies should also be included. Note: State grant eligibility is based on standards set by the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA). Institutional appeals do not cover State grants. Loss of State grant eligibility may be appealed directly to PHEAA in cases of illness or death in the family. 18Evaluation An evaluation of academic progress will be done after the end of the Spring semester or when students reapply for financial aid. Students who do not meet the requirements will be notified within ten days of the completion of the evaluation. Note: An evaluation will be done at the halfway point of the program for students enrolled in one-year programs. Federal Financial Aid Recipients Who Withdraw The 1998 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act requires the College to calculate a return of federal student aid funds for students who withdraw (officially or unofficially) from all classes on or before the 60 percent attendance point of the semester. Using the Federal formula, the percentage of the semester attended is used to calculate the amount of the student's earned versus unearned federal student aid funds. The number of calendar days spent attending classes is divided by the number of calendar days in the semester. The unearned portion of federal student aid funds will be returned to the appropriate aid program. Funds are returned in the following order: Unsubsidized Direct Loan Subsidized Direct Loan Perkins Loan Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) Pell Grant Program Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) Students receiving financial aid who withdraw from all of their classes may not receive further financial aid disbursements, may lose some or all of the aid that has already been disbursed to their account and are responsible for payment of any balance due after the required return of unearned federal student aid funds. Students who stop attending all classes without officially withdrawing will be subject to the return of federal funds at the end of the semester based on the 50 percent point of the semester. Notification of Award Students who have their financial aid applications completed by the priority application deadline will be notified of their eligibility for aid by the tuition due date. They will receive a financial aid award letter. Included with the award letter are instructions, conditions governing awards and disbursement information about how and when students will receive financial aid funds. Financial Aid Information Financial aid forms and information are available from the NCC Financial Aid Office in the Student Enrollment Center at the Main Campus, the Enrollment Office at the Monroe Campus, the Fowler Family South Side Center, and on the Financial Aid page of the NCC Web site at www.northampton.edu/admissions/tuition-aid-scholarships/financial-aid.htm . You can call the NCC Financial Aid Office at 610.861.5510. Policies: College/Academic Academic Honesty - Policy and Appeal Procedure Northampton Community College considers honesty to be essential to the learning experience. Academic honesty is one of the values that we expect members of the NCC community will apply in their work on this campus and take into their lives beyond NCC. Violations of academic honesty harm the learning experience and violate the expectations and values that the NCC community embraces. We expect all members of the NCC academic community to conduct themselves and their work ethically and honestly. Student Responsibilities Students are solely responsible for their work and for making sure that their work represents their own honest efforts to meet the goals of the course. They are responsible for showing that the work they present is theirs in whatever ways are deemed appropriate by the faculty for the course. They are responsible for learning and following the policies and expectations of the college and for understanding the consequences of actions that violate the policy on academic honesty. Faculty responsibilities Faculty members are responsible for demonstrating academic honesty in their work. They are responsible for making their expectations related to academic honesty clear to their classes including which activities and resources are allowed and the consequences for violations in their courses. They are responsible for communicating violations of the academic honesty policy to students and their division Dean and to the Assistant Dean of Students (Bethlehem) or the Associate Dean of Students (Monroe). Academic Honesty Violations Violations of the academic honesty policy include any actions that attempt to gain academic credit for work that does not represent the student's own efforts and knowledge.

Tampering with or damaging the work of others or preventing others from completing their own assignments. Penalties When a faculty member believes that a student has committed acts that violate the academic honesty policy, he or she will advise the student of the offense and the penalty imposed. A faculty member may apply one of the following penalties: 1. A written warning with the requirement that the assignment be redone within the instructor's specified time. Faculty members are encouraged to report the incident and action to their division Dean and to the Assistant Dean of Students (Bethlehem) or the AssociateDean of Students (Monroe) using online Academic Honesty Violation Form. 2. A failing grade for the assignment or test. Faculty members are encouraged to report the incident and action to their division Dean and to the Assistant Dean of Students (Bethlehem) or the Associate Dean of Students (Monroe) using the online Academic Honesty Violation Form. 3. An \"F\" grade for the course. If a faculty member issues an \"F\" grade in the course as a penalty for academic dishonesty, he or she must send a written report of the instance of cheating or plagiarism and the action taken to the division Dean and the Assistant Dean of Students (Bethlehem) or the Associate Dean of Students (Monroe) using the online Academic Honesty Violation Form. If the faculty member has given an \"F\" grade for the course as a penalty for a violation of academic honesty, a student may not withdraw from the course while the matter is under appeal or if it is resolved that the \"F\" grade stands. Appeal procedure-charges of academic dishonesty If a student wishes to appeal a charge of academic dishonesty or the penalty imposed, the student should follow these steps:Step 1 If the student wishes to respond to the accusation, he/she must make an appointment and meet with the faculty member at a formal meeting within ten working days of the notification. If the student and faculty member accept a specific resolution offered by either of them, the matter shall be considered closed. If such a resolution cannot be reached, the student may formally appeal the action of the faculty member within three working days after the meeting with the faculty member. Appeal of Charges of Academic Honesty Violation Forms and procedures will be available in the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. While an appeal is in process, the student may not withdraw from the course. Note: working day is defined as any day when a full schedule of classes are in session (this excludes Saturdays and Sundays).Step 2 Within three working days of the meeting with the faculty member, the student may request in writing that the appropriate dean call a meeting to include the student, faculty member, and program director, if any, within five working days. After this meeting, the dean will send all parties involved a written recommendation within three working days. Students who do not agree with the recommendation in Step 2 may appeal to the Academic Appeals Committee within three working days. This appeal must be submitted, in writing, to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Step 3 Students initiate appeals to the Academic Appeals Committee (within three days of notification of outcome of Step 2) by requesting a hearing through the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. A hearing will be scheduled as quickly as possible and all parties 20 to the appeal will be informed of the date, time, and place of the meeting. The faculty member will delay recording the grade for the work in question until the appeal is decided. The Academic Appeals Committee will decide whether evidence sustains or does not sustain such charges of academic dishonesty and whether the penalty is consistent with the stated policies. A decision will be recommended to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, whose decision is final unless different from the recommendation of the committee. In such cases, the student may appeal to the President whose decision is final. If evidence does not sustain such charges in the opinion of the committee and the Vice President for Academic Affairs, all records in the student's file related to this charge will be expunged. If evidence does sustain the charges and the appeal relates to the penalty, the committee may recommend the following actions: 1. The assigned penalty will be supported.2. The faculty member may be asked to reconsider the penalty in question. The Vice President for Academic Affairs will communicate in writing a decision to the student, faculty member, and Assistant Dean of Students (Bethlehem) or the Associate Dean of Students (Monroe) no later than three working days after the hearing. Recurring violations of Academic Dishonesty If the student is reported to have violated the Academic Honesty Policy repeatedly, the Assistant Dean of Students (Bethlehem) or the Associate Dean of Students (Monroe) shall request the Discipline Committee to consider the student's dismissal from the college. Academic Probation Policy Northampton Community College is committed to the academic success of its students. Students who do not achieve a cumulative grade point average in accordance with the following standards will be placed on academic probation: Cumulative Attempted Credits Cumulative GPA 9-25 1.50 26-40 1.75 41+ 2.00 Students placed on academic probation are subject to the following conditions: Students must meet with an academic probation counselor and develop a plan for improved academic performance. Students on probation for a first semester will be limited to maximum enrollment of 13 credits. Additionally, students may have some restrictions placed on them regarding the types of courses they take. The academic probation counselor will recommend action based on the meeting with the student and after review of the academic record. This action may include requiring students to take specific courses. Any student who has been placed on academic probation for two consecutive major semesters may be academically suspended for up to one academic year. If a student is academically suspended, he/she may appeal the suspension. A committee comprised of an Advising staff member, the appropriate Academic Dean, one faculty member from each academic division and the Vice President, Enrollment & Student Affairs or his/her designee will review the appeal and make a recommendation to the Vice President for Academic Affairs whose decision is final. Appeals must be made at least 6 weeks prior to the start of a fall semester, or 5 college days prior to the spring semester. Students who are academically suspended more than once and who do not make academic progress upon return to NCC will be dismissed from the institution for a minimum of three years. Academic Recognition Dean's List Students who complete a minimum of six credit hours per semester, and who earn a semester grade point average of 3.50 or higher, will be recognized on the Dean's Honor List for academic achievement. Graduation Honors Students who complete a minimum of 30 credits hours of coursework in the graduation major at Northampton, and have a graduation grade point average of 3.50 or higher in any degree, certificate or specialized diploma will be graduated with honors. The graduation grade point average includes only those courses used toward the graduation major. Academic Restart Policy The Academic Restart policy is intended for students who attended NCC in the past and compiled an unsatisfactory academic record. This one-time-only option allows students to redirect their academic goals and permits students to reset the NCC Grade Point Average and the Cumulative Credits earned. Eligibility is determined by: The student has not enrolled at NCC for at least three (3) consecutive academic years and has not earned an NCC degree. The student has a previous cumulative grade point average below 2.0. 21The student has not been granted the Academic Restart previously. The student has earned a grade point average of 2.0 or higher in a minimum of 12 credits since returning to NCC. The previous record will remain on the transcript; however, it will not be used in the computation of the new grade point average. Students may use non-developmental level courses they completed with a grade of C or better prior to Academic Restart toward completion of graduation requirements, but grades for these courses will not affect grade point average calculation. Interested students must complete an application and meet with a member of the Advising Office. A student's request for academic restart will be voided if 12 credits are not earned after four (4) semesters. Academic Restart will be recorded on the student's transcript upon certification by the Advising Office.Note: Given federal and state student aid regulations, the student is not relieved of academic progress requirements for financial aid eligibility, even if restart approval is granted. Some colleges will not accept courses prior to Academic Restart. Advanced Placement Policy All students may earn credit through the following options: 1. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) or Excelsior College Examination Program2. NCC Departmental Challenge Exams3. Advanced Placement Exams taken through the College Board4. Military and non-traditional training, as recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE) 5. Portfolio Assessment of Prior Learning6. Industry-recognized Credential A student must be enrolled in NCC courses to have such credits applied to the NCC transcript. All external examinations, ACE approved courses, credit for portfolio assessment, and industry-recognized credentials will be equated to NCC courses by appropriate department faculty. Criteria will be reviewed on a periodic basis to insure currency with existing course requirements. Students wishing more information on any of the above, except CLEP and the NCC challenge examination, should contact the Admissions Office. CLEP is administered through the Library and challenge examinations through the Records Office. Eligibility All new applicants and currently enrolled students are eligible to apply for credit using any of the above-mentioned options. Any form of advanced placement credit earned is added to the student's transcript upon final verification of enrollment (after the refund period of a student's first semester). Credit Limits A minimum of 25% of credits required for any degree, certificate or specialized diploma must be earned through NCC course work. Remaining credits may be awarded through transfer or as outlined in this policy. Record of Credits Advanced placement credit earned will be entered on the student's transcript with specific reference to the test or method used for granting credits. Equating Credits All methods of advanced placement will be equated to NCC courses or general electives as approved by department faculty. The Admissions and Records Offices will maintain a list of approved equivalencies. Students who have successfully completed any of these advanced placement methods prior to or while attending NCC may request an evaluation of credits earned. Grades Only credits will be recorded on the transcript for any advanced placement credit awarded; no grade will be given*. Students who earn credit through this policy and later take the equivalent course at NCC will be given credit and grade earned only for the NCC course. *Exceptions may be approved by the academic dean or designee in the case of developmental math modular units. Credit may be awarded through: 1) College Level Examination Program (CLEP) or Excelsior College Examinations Students may take the CLEP examinations at either NCC Library or a national testing center. Excelsior examinations may be taken at any Sylvan Learning Center after test registration has been completed through Excelsior College. Credit for CLEP tests and Excelsior exams will be awarded for scores recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE) for the former and Excelsior College for the latter, unless a Northampton department performs its own research and determines a more appropriate cut-off score. 2) Departmental Challenge Exams NCC departmental challenge exams are available for certain designated courses. Subject to faculty approval, students may challenge a course only one time and may not challenge a course in which they have been enrolled beyond the first three weeks of the semester, or the equivalent time in a shorter course. Courses must be challenged in sequence. If a course has a prerequisite, that prerequisite must be fulfilled through course work or credit by examination acceptable to the College before a challenge examination may be taken. Internships and courses numbered 0XX will not be. 22 available for challenge*. Credit for NCC challenge examinations will be awarded for scores determined by faculty to be at a passing level. For information about the availability of departmental challenge examinations, students should contact the Records Office. *Exceptions may be approved by the academic dean or designee in the case of developmental math modular units. 3) Advanced Placement exams taken through the College Board The College awards credit to students who successfully completed Advanced Placement (AP) courses and submit official exam scores that meet required score levels. Department faculty will determine courses to be accepted, credit to be awarded, and equivalency of each course to NCC courses. The Admissions Office will maintain a list of Advanced Placement courses, and their required scores, as approved by faculty. 4) Military and Non-Traditional Training Credit will be awarded based on recommendations by the American Council on Education (ACE), unless a Northampton department performs its own research and determines a more appropriate recommendation. 5) Portfolio Assessment of Prior Learning Criteria for each course will be developed (if appropriate) by the academic department to establish the proof of knowledge/learning gained by experiences outside the classroom. Credit will be awarded upon faculty evaluation of presented portfolio. The Admissions Office will have a list of portfolio criteria needed for assessment. 6) Industry-recognized Credentials Department faculty will determine NCC course equivalency for certain industry-recognized credentials. The Admissions Office will maintain a list of the approved credentials. Appeals Academic Appeals Appeals of grades, appeals of penalties for academic dishonesty, and appeals of actions related to the policy on Professional Conduct, will begin informally through discussion between the student and the faculty member involved and will proceed, if continued, through a series of formal steps culminating in a hearing before an Academic Appeals Committee, which will present its findings and recommendations for a decision to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. No final recommendation can be made without a quorum. The decision of the Vice President for Academic Affairs will be final, unless it differs from that of the committee; in such cases, the student may appeal to the President, whose decision is final. The appeals procedure is a student-motivated one; the responsibility to keep the action in progress rests primarily with the student. Academic Appeals Committee The Academic Appeals Committee reviews matters related to appeals of grades, appeals of penalties for academic dishonesty, appeals of actions related to the policy on professional conduct, and waivers of graduation requirements. The Academic Appeals Committee shall be composed of the following: 5 full-time faculty members (at least two shall teach at the Monroe campus) elected to a two year term at large from Academic Affairs, one Student Services faculty member elected by that cluster, and four students (at least 2 shall attend classes at the Monroe campus) appointed for a one year term by the Student Senate and/or Monroe Student Governance. A quorum shall consist of the following: 7 persons - including 3 faculty members, 2 students, one student services faculty member and a dean (appointed by the President to hear the case). The Registrar may be asked to attend as an ex-officio member. Appeals Not Covered Under Other Policies Students may appeal a decision made by an administrator responsible for a department or division to the Vice President for Academic Affairs or Vice President, Enrollment & Student Affairs. The Vice President's decision will be final unless stated otherwise in specific College policy. Attendance Policy Class attendance and engagement in the learning process are critical factors in determining students' success in their courses. NCC students are expected to attend all class sessions of courses in which they are enrolled, and are responsible for all material presented in class sessions of these courses. However, a student who misses class more than twice the number of weekly meetings of the class* (or the equivalent in short term courses) may be withdrawn from the course by the instructor. Students who are withdrawn for poor attendance will receive a grade of W. Faculty may issue a withdrawal through the first 90% of the semester (14th week or equivalent in short term classes*). After the 90% period, a student may not withdraw or be withdrawn. In an internet-based online learning course, a student is considered to have missed the equivalent of more than twice the number of weekly meetings of a traditional classroom course in a consecutive two-week period if there has been no participation by the student in the class through submission of assignments, participation in discussion forums or contact with the professor in any way during the period. Students who are withdrawn from the class for lack of attendance may appeal the enforced withdrawal to the instructor. If the Instructor agrees to reinstate the student, he/she will be required to complete a reinstatement form and return it directly to the Vice President, Enrollment & Student Affairs. If the appeal is denied, the student may speak with the appropriate academic dean and/or the Vice President, Enrollment & Student Affairs. Further discussion may take place with the faculty member, but the final decision on the withdrawal rests with the faculty member. 23* Clinical and lab courses may have a different application of this attendance policy and it will be so noted on each syllabus. Audit Policy A student may apply to audit a course. Auditing students are not required to take examinations and do not receive grades or earn credits for the class. Enrollment for the purpose of auditing shall be on a space available basis. Priority in class enrollment shall be given to students desiring to take courses for credit; therefore enrollment for audit purposes will only be permitted during the first week of the semester. Auditors must be eligible for admission to the College. A student can only audit a course one time. Auditors pay standard tuition and fees. The student should identify himself to the instructor as an auditing student and discuss parameters of participating in classroom discussions. If a student wants to change from audit to credit, all prerequisites must be met. The change must be made by the end of the refund period for that course with the consent of the instructor. Instructors may request of the Vice President, Enrollment & Student Affairs that an auditor be officially withdrawn from the course if the auditor is interfering with the learning process. Class Load A minimum full-time class load is 12 credit hours. Students registering for 12 or more credit hours in either the fall or spring semester or for 8 or more in any summer session must have approval from an academic advisor. Students will not be allowed to take more than 19 credit hours for either the fall or spring semester or more than 13 credit hours in the summer unless required by their academic program. Exceptions may be granted for students who have a G.P.A of at least 2.75, advisor or Dean recommendation. Completing an Associate's Degree in Two Years The number of credit hours that a student must carry in order to complete a program within a two-year period will vary depending upon his or her academic program. Consult the Catalog program description for the variation in credits required by each program. Students who elect to pursue a minimum full-time load (12 credits) each semester cannot graduate in two years unless they complete a significant number of credits during summer sessions. If students must take developmental courses, it will take more than two years to complete a degree. Students are encouraged to review all this information with their academic advisor and to discuss the option that presents the strongest opportunity for academic success. Classification of Students Students attending the College will be classified as follows: Freshman: Successfully completed fewer than 24 credit hours Sophomore: Successfully completed 24 or more credit hours Course Credit Policy Each course that offers academic credit is assigned a credit value based on the number of scheduled student contact hours and the type of teaching modality used to deliver the course. The college defines a semester credit hour as a unit of coursework equivalent to either 1) 50 minutes of lecture instruction and student engagement per week for 15 weeks or 2) a laboratory comprised of 2-3 hours weekly of structured laboratory learning involving the faculty and the student for 15 weeks, or 3) up to 75 hours of internship or fieldwork for 15 weeks. For courses offered on a schedule different from the 15 week schedule, the associated instructional time (typically 2250 minutes for a three credit course) is distributed evenly over the scheduled weeks of the course. The credit value for each course is displayed as a number ratio following the course title and credit assignment. The first digit indicates the weekly lecture hours; the second digit indicates the weekly laboratory hours; the third digit (where appropriate) indicates the number of weekly experiential learning hours (clinical, internship, practicum, etc.) Courses are designed such that students should expect to study a minimum of two hours outside of class for every hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction. Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct Policy Policy Statement Members of the NCC community, guests and visitors have the right to be free from sexual discrimination, harassment and misconduct. All members of the campus community are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that does not infringe upon the rights of others. When an allegation of misconduct is brought to an appropriate administrator's attention, and a respondent is found to have violated this policy, serious sanctions will be used to reasonably ensure that such actions are never repeated. This policy has been developed to reaffirm these principles and to provide recourse for those individuals whose rights have been violated. This policy is intended to define community expectations and to establish a mechanism for determining when those expectations have been violated. Northampton Community College is committed to providing a learning, working and living environment that promotes personal integrity, civility and mutual respect in a place free of discrimination on the basis of sex; which includes all forms of sexual misconduct. Sex discrimination violates an individual's fundamental rights and personal dignity. Northampton Community College considers sex discrimination in all its forms to be a serious offense. This policy refers to all forms of sex discrimination, including but not limited to: sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking by employees, students, or third parties. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination based on sex in educational programs and activities that receive federal 24 financial assistance. To ensure compliance with Title IX and other federal and state civil rights laws, the College has developed policies and procedures that prohibit sex discrimination in all of its forms. Northampton Community College does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, age, gender, sexual orientation, sexual identity, religion, national origin, veteran status, disability, genetic information or any other basis of prohibited discrimination in its programs and activities. This policy extends to employment, programs and admission to the College. This policy applies to all faculty, staff, students, and visitors. It also governs student-on-student sexual discrimination, including sexual assault, both on and off-campus. Persons who experience discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct may respond to the experience in many different ways, including feeling confused, vulnerable, out of control, embarrassed, angry, or depressed. The College provides a variety of resources to assist individuals who have experienced discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct to address the effects of the incident and to help them determine whether and how to make a formal complaint about the incident. Additional resource-related information can be found in Section VIII. All reports of discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation shall be promptly made to the Title IX Officer (or one of the designated Deputy Coordinators). The Vice President for Administrative Affairs serves as the Title IX Officer, the ADA/504 Coordinator and oversees implementation of the College's Affirmative Action office and the College's Policy on Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct. The designated Title IX Deputy Coordinators are the Assistant Dean of Students, the Associate Dean of Students at the Monroe Campus the Director of Housing, and the Associate Director of Human Resources. Reporting responsibilities are described in Section III below for those individuals who become aware of incidents involving discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct. Additionally, a complainant's options for reporting are addressed more specifically in Section IV below. I. Prohibited Conduct 1. Discrimination Northampton Community College adheres to all federal and state civil rights laws banning discrimination in public institutions of higher education. The College prohibits discrimination against any employee, applicant for employment, student or applicant for admission on the basis of any protected class. Protected classes include: age, color, creed, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, genetic information, marital status, national origin, political affiliation, pregnancy, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran or military status, or any other protected category under applicable federal, state, or local law, including protections for those opposing discrimination or participating in any complaint process on campus or with other human rights agencies. This policy covers discrimination in employment and in access to educational opportunities. Discrimination is defined as adverse treatment of an individual based on that individual's membership in one or more of the protected groups listed above. Therefore, any member of the campus community, guest, or visitor who acts to deny, deprive, or limit the educational, employment, housing and/or social access, benefits, and/or opportunities of any member of the campus community on the basis of their actual or perceived membership in the protected classes listed above is in violation of the College policy on discrimination. All College employees shall report all suspected incidents of discrimination or harassment (see Section III. Reporting Responsibilities). When brought to the attention of the College, any such discrimination will be appropriately remedied according to the procedures outlined in this policy. 2. Harassment NCC prohibits harassment against any employee, student, visitor, or guest on the basis of any class protected by College policy or law as identified in Section I.A. above. This policy is not meant to inhibit or prohibit educational content or discussions inside or outside of the classroom that include germane but controversial or sensitive subject matters. The sections below describe the specific forms of prohibited harassment under College policy. 1. Bias-Related Harassment This policy prohibits any form of harassment on the basis of actual or perceived membership in a protected class, by any member or group of the campus community, which unreasonably interferes with an individual's work or academic environment. This environment may be created by verbal, written, graphic, threatening and/or physical conduct that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive so as to interfere with, limit, or deny the ability of an individual to participate in or benefit from educational programs or activities or employment access, benefits, or opportunities. Merely offensive conduct and/or harassment of a generic nature not on the basis of membership in a protected class may not result in a violation of this policy but may be addressed through education and/or other resolution methods. 2. Sexual Harassment This policy prohibits any form of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unwelcome sexual- or gender-based verbal, written, online, and/or physical conduct. Anyone experiencing sexual harassment in any College program is encouraged to report it online (www.northampton.edu/reportit), to NCC's Title IX Officer or a Deputy Coordinator, or by methods identified in the Complaint Resolution Process Section (IV.A. Confidentiality and Reporting of Offenses). Sexual harassment creates a hostile environment and offenders may be disciplined when it is sufficiently severe, pervasive, persistent, or objectively offensive that it: has the effect of unreasonably interfering with, denying, or limiting employment opportunities or the ability to participate in or benefit from the College's educational, social, and/or residential program, or is based on power differentials (quid pro quo), the creation of a hostile environment, or retaliation. 25Some examples of possible sexual harassment include: A professor insists that a student have sex with him/her in exchange for a good grade. This is harassment regardless of whether the student complies with the request. A student repeatedly sends sexually oriented jokes on an e-mail list the student created, even when asked to stop, causing one recipient to avoid the sender on campus and in the residence hall in which they both live. Two supervisors frequently rate several employees' bodies and sex appeal, commenting suggestively about their clothing and appearance. Consensual Relationships. There are inherent risks in any romantic or sexual relationship between individuals in unequal positions (such as faculty and student, supervisor and employee). These relationships may be less consensual than perceived by the individual whose position confers power. The relationship also may be viewed in different ways by each of the parties, particularly in retrospect. Furthermore, circumstances may change, and conduct that was previously welcome may become unwelcome. Even when both parties have consented at the outset to a romantic or sexual involvement, this past consent may not remove grounds for a later charge of a violation of applicable sections of the faculty/staff handbooks. For the personal protection of members of this community, relationships in which power differentials are inherent (faculty-student, staff-student, administrator-student) are generally discouraged. Consensual romantic or sexual relationships in which one party maintains a direct supervisory or evaluative role over the other party are unethical. Therefore, persons with direct supervisory or evaluative responsibilities who are involved in such relationships must bring those relationships to the timely attention of their supervisor, and will likely result in the necessity to remove the employee from the supervisory or evaluative responsibilities, or shift the student out of being supervised or evaluated by someone with whom they have established a consensual relationship. This includes CAs and mentors and students over whom they have direct responsibility. While no relationships are prohibited by this policy, failure to self-report such relationships to a supervisor as required can result in disciplinary action for an employee. 3. Sexual Misconduct This policy prohibits any form of sexual misconduct. Acts of sexual misconduct may be committed by any person upon any other person, regardless of the sex, gender, sexual orientation, and/or gender identity of those involved. The definition of consent below will be used in the interpretation and application of this policy: Consent. Consent is knowing, voluntary, and clear permission by word or action to engage in mutually agreed upon sexual activity. Since individuals may experience the same interaction in different ways, it is the responsibility of each party to make certain that the other has consented before engaging in the activity. For consent to be valid, there must be a clear expression in words or actions that the other individual consented to that specific sexual conduct. Consent to a specific sexual contact (such as kissing or fondling) cannot be presumed to be consent for another specific sexual activity (such as intercourse). A current or previous dating relationship is not sufficient to constitute consent. Silence or the absence of resistance alone is not consent. The existence of consent is based on the totality of the circumstances, including the context in which the alleged incident occurred. Individuals can withdraw consent at any time during sexual activity by expressing in words or actions that they no longer want the act to continue, and, if that happens, the other person must stop immediately. A person cannot consent if he or she is incapacitated. Under this policy, a person is incapacitated if he or she is disabled or deprived of ability to act or reason for one's self, is unable to understand what is happening, or is disoriented, helpless, asleep, or unconscious for any reason, including due to alcohol or other drugs. Incapacitation is defined as a state where someone cannot make rational, reasonable decisions because they lack the capacity to give knowing consent (e.g., to understand the \"who, what, when, where, why, or how\" of their sexual interaction). This policy also covers a person whose incapacity results from mental disability, involuntary physical restraint, and/or from taking of an incapacitating substance. A person is incapacitated if the person is temporarily incapable of apprising or controlling the person's own conduct due to the influence of a narcotic, anesthetic, or intoxicating substance; if a person is unable to communicate an unwillingness to act because the person is unconscious, asleep, or is otherwise physically limited; or if the person has a bodily impairment or handicap that substantially limits the person's ability to resist or flee. An individual who engages in sexual activity when the individual knows, or should know, that the other person is physically or mentally incapacitated has violated this policy. It is not an excuse that the respondent to a claim of sexual misconduct was intoxicated and, therefore, did not realize the other person's incapacity. The following are types of prohibited sexual misconduct under this policy: 1. Sexual Harassment (defined above) 2. Non-Consensual Sexual Intercourse Defined as any sexual penetration or intercourse (anal, oral, or vaginal) however slight with any object by a person upon another person that is without consent and/or by force. Sexual penetration includes vaginal or anal penetration by a penis, tongue, finger, or object, or oral copulation by mouth- to-genital contact or genital-to-mouth contact. 3. Non-Consensual Sexual Contact Defined as any intentional sexual touching however slight with any object by a person upon another person that is without consent and/or by force. 26Sexual touching includes any bodily contact with the breasts, groin, genitals, mouth, or other bodily orifice of another individual or any other bodily contact in a sexual manner. 4.Sexual Exploitation Defined as taking non-consensual or abusive sexual advantage of another; and the conduct does not fall within the definitions of sexual harassment, non-consensual sexual intercourse, or non-consensual sexual contact. Examples of sexual exploitation include, but are not limited to: sexual voyeurism (such as watching a person undressing, using the bathroom, or engaging in sexual acts without the consent of the person observed) taking photographs, video recording, or audio recording of another in a sexual act or in any other private activity without the consent of all persons involved in the activity exceeding the boundaries of consent (such as allowing another person to hide in a closet and observe sexual activity or disseminating sexual pictures without the photographed person's consent) engaging in sexual activity with another person while knowingly infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other sexually transmitted disease (STD) without informing the other person of the infection administering alcohol or drugs (such as \"date rape\" drugs) to another person without the person's knowledge or consent 5. Relationship Violence Defined as violence between those in an intimate relationship (this includes romantic, dating, or domestic relationships). Examples include, but are not limited to: physical assault between two people in a current or prior intimate relationship who do not live together (Dating Violence) physical assault between two people in an intimate relationship who live together (Domestic Violence) 6.Stalking Defined as a course of conduct directed at a specific person that is unwelcome and would cause a reasonable person to feel fear or suffer substantial emotional distress. Examples include, but are not limited to: sending multiple unwanted text messages, phone calls, or electronic communications following, watching, photographing, or otherwise tracking an individual without his or her permission sending unwelcome gifts, notes, or other items to another person 3.Retaliation The College seeks to create an environment where its students and employees are free, without fear of reprisal, to use its procedures to determine if there has been a violation of their civil rights. Any act of retaliation will result in appropriate disciplinary action. Retaliation is defined as any adverse action taken against a person participating in a protected activity because of their participation in that protected activity. Retaliation against an individual for alleging a violation of their civil rights, supporting a complainant, or forassisting in providing information relevant to a claim, is a serious violation of the this policy. Acts of alleged retaliation should bereported immediately to the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinators. 4. Other Offenses This policy prohibits other offenses of a discriminatory, harassing, and/or retaliatory nature not included in the previous sections as follows: Intimidation, defined under this policy as implied threats or acts that cause a reasonable fear of harm in another on the basis of actual or perceived membership in a protected class Hazing, defined under this policy as acts likely to cause physical or psychological harm or social ostracism to any person within the College community when related to the admission, initiation, joining, or any other group-affiliation activity on the basis of actual or perceived membership in a protected class. Bullying, defined under this policy as repeated and/or severe aggressive behavior likely to intimidate or intentionally hurt, control or diminish another person, physically or mentally on the basis of actual or perceived membership in a protected class. Violation of any other College rule, when it is motivated by sex or gender or the actual or perceived membership of the victim in a protected class, may be pursued using this policy and process. II. Scope/Jurisdiction/Application This policy applies to allegations of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation that take place on NCC property or at College-sponsored events, regardless of their location. This policy may also apply to allegations of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation that occur off-campus or to actions online when the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinator determines that the off-campus or online conduct could have an on-campus impact or impact on the educational mission of the College. Such impact includes: Any action that constitutes a criminal offense as defined by federal, state, or local law; Any situation where it appears that the respondent may present a danger or threat to the health or safety of self or others; Any situation that significantly impinges upon the rights, property, or achievements of others or significantly breaches the peace and/or causes social disorder; and/or 27Any situation that is detrimental to the educational interests of the College. III. Reporting Responsibilities All College employees who are aware of or witness discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, or retaliation are required to promptly report to the Title IX Officer or a Title IX Deputy Coordinator. Any student who is aware of or who witnesses discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, or retaliation is encouraged to promptly report to the Title IX Officer or a Title IX Deputy Coordinator. All initial contacts will be treated with the maximum possible privacy: specific information on any complaint received by any party will be reported to the Title IX Officer, but, subject to the College's obligation to investigate and redress violations, every reasonable effort will be made to maintain the privacy of those initiating a report of a complaint. In all cases, the College will give consideration to the complainant with respect to how the complaint is pursued but reserves the right, when necessary to protect the community, to investigate and pursue a resolution when an alleged victim chooses not to initiate or participate in a formal complaint. Please note: This section addresses reporting obligations for members of our campus community who are made aware of potential violations of this policy. Methods for filing a complaint and the Complaint Resolution Process are detailed in Section IV. Additional resource-related information can be found in Section VIII. 1. Title IX Officer and Deputy Coordinators Helene Whitaker, the Vice President for Administrative Affairs serves as the EEO Officer, ADA Coordinator and the Title IX Coordinator for the College. She is available to anyone seeking additional information or wishing to file a complaint.

Where appropriate, the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinators will provide to both parties information on options forobtaining advocacy, medical and counseling services, and making criminal reports, and will assist with providing information on otherresources. The Title IX Officer and Deputy Coordinators will coordinate with other campus officials to take appropriate interim actionssuch as no contact orders, academic accommodations, and rearrangement of housing and work assignments. 3. Police Reporting In addition to required campus reporting, reports may also be made to the police and/or campus security, especially if a crime is or may be involved, by calling the following numbers: Emergency - 911 Bethlehem Township Police Fowler: 484.390.3240 4.Federal Timely Warning Obligations Victims of sexual misconduct should be aware that College administrators must issue crime alerts for incidents reported to them that represent a serious or continuing threat to students or employees. The College will withhold a victim's name and other identifying information while providing enough information for community members to make safety decisions in light of the potential danger. IV. Complaint Resolution Process The College will respond to any alleged violation of this policy received by the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinators. This section outlines ways in which offenses can be reported by individuals choosing to pursue complaint options. Additional resource-related information can be found in Section VIII. 1. Confidentiality and Reporting of Offenses Northampton Community College will make every effort to safeguard the identities of individuals who seek help and/or report discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation. While steps are taken to protect the privacy of victims, College's ability to respond may belimited in the event of a request for confidentiality. The College may need to investigate an incident and take action once an allegation isknown, whether or not the reporting individual chooses to pursue a complaint. When a report is made, personally identifiable information (name of victim, name of respondent, etc.) may be initially withheld in cases where the victim is hesitant to come forward. Subsequently, campus officials may need additional information. The College Title IXOfficer or Deputy Coordinator will conduct an initial inquiry, looking for any sign of pattern, predation, violence, or threat. When suchexists, institutional action may be required in an effort to ensure campus safety. No employee should ever promise absolute confidentiality except those as described below in Section IV.A.2. Reports may be private, but not confidential, as described below in Section IV.A.3. Reports to police and/or Title IX officials do not obligate the complainant tofile any criminal or College conduct charges. The College will not pursue disciplinary action for improper use of alcohol or other drugs against an alleged victim of sexual misconduct or against another student who shares information as either a witness to or as a reporter of sexual misconduct as long as the report ismade in good faith. See \"Good Samaritan Provision,\" Appendix 4 Deliberately false and/or malicious accusations of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, as opposed to complaints which, even if erroneous, are made in good faith, are just as serious an offense as discrimination, harassment, or retaliation and will be subject toappropriate disciplinary action. Complaints and reports should be made as soon as possible after an incident. If the incident is an assault: Report the incident: Local Police - Emergency - 911 Bethlehem Township Police (non-emergency number)- 610.759.2200 Pocono 570.369.1911 Fowler: 484.390.3240 Seek immediate medical attention. Do not change clothing, shower, bathe, brush teeth or douche. Delay the above and going to the bathroom (if possible) until you are examined as this preserves evidence of the assault. Medical attention should be accessed at a local hospital. Seek emotional support. It is important that you talk about this issue and that you tell someone you trust. On-campus you may contact: Counseling staff 610.861.5342 Health and Wellness Center staff - 610.861.5365 Residence Life staff - 610.861.5324 or 610.861.4115 29Off-campus you may contact: Crime Victims Council/ hotline (Bethlehem)- 610.437.6611 Women's Resources Hotline (Monroe)- 570.421.4200 North Penn Legal Services - 610.317.5317 Options for filing a report include: 1.Anonymous and Third Party Reporting The Title IX Officer and Deputy Coordinators accept anonymous and third-party reports of conduct alleged to violate this policy and will follow up on such reports. The individual making the report is encouraged to provide as much detailed information as possible to allow the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinators to investigate and respond as appropriate. The College may belimited in its ability to investigate an anonymous or third party report unless sufficient information is provided. (Seewww.northampton.edu/reportit ) 2. Confidential Reporting If a reporting party would like the details of an incident to be kept confidential, the reporting party may speak with counselors, health service providers, victim services advocates, domestic violence resources, local or state assistance agencies, or membersof the clergy who are permitted by law to maintain confidentiality (except in extreme cases of immediacy of threat or danger orabuse of a minor). These sources may submit anonymous statistical information for timely warning and Clery Act purposes. If areporting party is unsure of a resource's ability to maintain confidentiality, the reporting party is advised to ask them beforetalking to them. NCC counselors for students and/or the Employee Assistance Program for employees are available to help free of charge and can be seen on an emergency basis. 3. Private Reporting Reports to College employees who are not confidential resources listed above in Section IV.A.2. should be treated with the maximum possible privacy. If a reporting party is unsure of a resource's ability to maintain privacy, the reporting party is advisedto ask them before talking to them. The resource will be able to explain the resource's reporting obligations and help a reportingparty make decisions about who is in the best position to help. If personally identifiable information is shared, it will be sharedwith as few people as possible under the circumstances and efforts will be made to protect privacy to the greatest extentreasonably possible. 4. Formal Reporting Complainants are encouraged to speak to College officials, such as the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinators or NCC Security, to make formal reports. Complainants have the right, and can expect, to have complaints taken seriously by the College whenformally reported and to have those incidents investigated and properly resolved through these procedures. Formal reporting stillaffords privacy to the reporter and only a small group of officials who need to know will be told. Information will be shared asnecessary with investigator(s), witnesses, the respondent, and a hearing board if deemed appropriate. The number of people withthis knowledge will be kept as few as reasonably possible to preserve a complainant's rights and privacy. 5. Criminal Reporting If someone is in immediate danger or is a victim of a crime, call 9-1-1. Some acts of discrimination and harassment may also be crimes, such as sexual assault or stalking. Allegations of criminal conduct should be reported to law enforcement even when it isnot clear whether the conduct rises to the level of a crime. Regardless, law enforcement can assist with obtaining medical care,getting immediate law enforcement response and protection, connecting with victim advocate services and counseling support,initiating a criminal investigation as appropriate and answering questions about the criminal process. 2. Informal Resolution Process Informal resolution is an alternative to the formal complaint resolution process. The Title IX Officer will determine if informal resolution is appropriate, based on the willingness of the parties and the nature of the alleged conduct. Sanctions are generally not pursued as theresult of an informal resolution process, though the parties may agree to appropriate remedies. The Title IX Officer will keep records ofany resolution that is reached. The College reserves the right to cancel informal resolution if sufficient evidence suggests a formalinvestigation or other sanctions or remedies may be necessary and appropriate. It is not necessary to pursue informal resolution first in order to make a formal complaint, and anyone participating in informal resolution can stop that process at any time and request to continue through the formal process. Except in cases involving criminal activity and/or sexual assault, an employee or student alleging discrimination, harassment and/or retaliation against an employee under this policy is encouraged to consider an informal resolution. If it is appropriate, an attempt tofacilitate an informal resolution of the matter will be made. In the event that an informal resolution is not reached, is not appropriate, or isnot pursued, the student or employee who is alleging the discrimination, harassment, or retaliation may initiate a formal investigation. 3. Formal Resolution Process 1.Filing a Complaint 30Any individual who believes that this policy has been violated should contact the Title IX Officer or any Title IX Deputy Coordinator. 1. Complaint Intake Following receipt of notice or a complaint, the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinator will normally, within five college days, make an initial determination as to whether the information has merit to reasonably indicate there may have been a violation of College policy. If it appears a violation may have occurred, an investigation will begin. If the complaint does not appear to allege a policy violation or if conflict resolution is desired by the complainant and appears appropriate given the nature of the alleged behavior, then the complaint does not proceed to investigation. An investigation will be pursued if there is sufficient information to suggest a policy violation, a pattern of misconduct, and/or a perceived threat of further harm to the community or any of its members may exist. 2. Interim Action The College will implement interim and/or protective actions upon notice of alleged discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation and will take additional prompt remedial and/or disciplinary action with respect to any member of the community, guest, or visitor who has violated this policy. Interim actions include but are not limited to: no contact orders, no trespass notices, providing counseling and/or medical services, academic support, living arrangement adjustments, providing a campus escort, academic or work schedule and assignment accommodations, safety planning, and referral to campus and community resources. The College may suspend, on an interim basis, a student or student organization or place an employee on administrative leave pending the completion of the investigation and procedures. In cases in which an interim suspension or administrative leave is imposed, the student, employee, or student organization will be given the opportunity to meet with an appropriate administrator prior to such action being imposed, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible, to show cause why the action should not be implemented. Violation of interim provisions will be grounds for disciplinary action. During an interim suspension or administrative leave, a student or employee may be denied access to College housing and/or the College campus, facilities, or events, either entirely or with specific application. As determined by the appropriate administrative officer, this restriction includes classes and/or all other College activities or privileges for which the individual might otherwise be eligible. At the discretion of the appropriate administrative officer, alternative coursework options may be pursued to ensure as minimal an impact as possible on the respondent student. At the discretion of the appropriate administrative officer, alternative employment/work options may be pursued to ensure as minimal an impact as possible on the respondent employee. 2. Notice of Charges Once an investigator has been assigned, written notice of the allegations will be provided to the parties involved. If the respondent is an employee, the written notice will be copied to the employee's department head/director, dean, vice president, and president. 3. Investigation If a complainant wishes to pursue a formal complaint or if the College determines an investigation is necessary, the Title IX Officer will assign an investigator, usually within five college days of determining that a complaint should proceed. Investigations will be thorough and impartial and will entail interviews with relevant parties and witnesses, and obtaining available evidence. Conflict of interest (real or perceived) by the investigator will not be allowed. The College aims to complete investigations within 60 days, which can be extended as necessary for appropriate cause by the Title IX Officer with notice to the parties. Investigation may take longer when initial complaints fail to provide direct first-hand information. The College may undertake a short delay (usually 3-10 days, to allow evidence collection) when criminal charges are being investigated. Complainants will be informed, at regular intervals, of the status of the investigation. College action will continue regardless of the status of civil or criminal charges involving the same incident. A complainant may proceed with both a criminal charge and a request for a College resolution simultaneously. 1. Student Withdrawal While Charges Pending Should a responding student decide to withdraw from the College and/or not participate in the investigation and/or hearing, the process will nonetheless proceed in the student's absence to a reasonable resolution and that student will not be permitted to return to the College unless any and all sanctions have been satisfied. The Title IX Officer will continue to act to promptly and effectively remedy the effects of the conduct upon the victim and the community. 2. Employee Resignation While Charges Pending Should a responding employee resign while charges are pending, the records of the Title IX Officer will reflect that status, as will College responses to any future inquiries regarding employment references for that individual. Should an employee decide to leave and not participate in the investigation and/or hearing, the process will nonetheless proceed in the employee's absence to a reasonable resolution and that employee will not be permitted to return to the College unless any and all sanctions have been satisfied. The Title IX Officer will continue to act to promptly and effectively remedy the effects of the conduct upon the victim and the community. 314.Investigation Findings 1.For Students Upon receipt of the investigative report, the Title IX Officer will forward it to the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Services or designee for an appropriate hearing per the Student Code of Conduct procedures. During a hearing: Both the complainant and the respondent will receive equivalent notice of the process. The complainant will have the opportunity to be present throughout the entire Hearing. The complainant will be entitled to the same opportunity to have others present during a Hearing as is provided to the respondent, including residence hall staff and/or a College Support Person; Both the complainant and the respondent will have the opportunity to present witnesses with information pertinent to the alleged sexual harassment, sexual misconduct or sexual assault, and any relevant information to the Hearing panel during the conduct process; The complainant will be provided options for reasonable alternative arrangements if he or she does not want to be present in the same room as the respondent during the Hearing; Testimony regarding any party's past sexual conduct will ordinarily not be permitted, except in those instances where there was a prior sexual relationship between the parties and the testimony may be relevant to the issue of consent. If the respondent is found responsible for the conduct alleged in the complaint, his or her past sexual misconduct, if any, may be considered in determining the appropriate outcome. The College will document the proceedings. Following the hearing, the decision of whether a policy violation has occurred will be determined by using a preponderance of the evidence standard. A finding of a policy violation by a preponderance of the evidence means that it is more likely than not that the policy violation occurred. If, following the hearing, the decision is that no policy violation has occurred the process will end. Regardless of the outcome, the complainant, the respondent, and the Title IX Officer will be notified of the finding in writing. If, following a hearing, the student is found to have violated College policy, appropriate disciplinary sanctions will be determined after consultation with the Title IX Officer. The Vice President for Enrollment and Student Affairs (or designee) will notify the respondent, the complainant, and the Title IX Officer in writing of the Vice President's decision. This written decision must be issued within fifteen college days of the date of receipt of the investigative report from the Title IX Officer. 2. For Employees Investigations will be thorough and impartial and will entail interviews with relevant parties and witnesses, and obtaining available evidence. Both the complainant and the respondent will have the opportunity to present witnesses withinformation pertinent to the alleged sexual harassment, sexual misconduct or sexual assault, and any relevantinformation. The investigator will document the proceedings. Upon receipt of the investigative report, the Title IX Officer will determine if this policy has been violated by using a preponderance of the evidence standard. A finding of a policy violation by a preponderance of the evidence means that itis more likely than not that the policy violation occurred. If the Title IX Officer decides that no policy violation hasoccurred, then the process will end. Regardless of the outcome, the complainant and the respondent will be notified ofthe finding in writing. The respondent's department head/director, Dean, Vice President, and the President will also benotified of the finding. In the event that the employee violated College policy, the Vice President of the respondent will determine appropriate disciplinary sanctions based on the recommendation from the Title IX Officer. Regardless of the outcome, thecomplainant, the respondent, and the Title IX Officer will be notified in writing of the outcome within twenty collegedays of the date of the notice from the Title IX Officer. If the Vice President serves as a party or witness in theinvestigation, the Title IX Officer's recommendation will be sent to the President for determination of disciplinarysanctions. 5. Sanctions Sanctions will be recommended by the Title IX Officer and forwarded to the decision-making authority as noted above in Section IV.C.4. Factors considered when determining a sanction may include: The nature of, severity of, and circumstances surrounding the violation The respondent's disciplinary history Previously founded complaints or allegations against the respondent involving similar conduct Any other information deemed relevant by the Title IX Officer The need to bring an end to the discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation The need to prevent the future recurrence of discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation The need to remedy the effects of the discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation on the victim and the community 1.Student Sanctions For examples of the range of potential disciplinary sanctions against students, see the section of the Student Handbook entitled Disciplinary Actions. 322. Employee Sanctions Sanctions for an employee who has violated this policy may include, but are not limited to, verbal or written warning, required counseling, training, demotion, reassignment, suspension, and termination. 6. Appeals Appeals of the decision of the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Affairs (for students) or the Vice President/President (for employees) may be filed by the complainant, the respondent or both. All requests for appeal considerations must be submitted in writing to the Title IX Officer within five college days of the date of the final written notice. Appeals are limited to allegations of the following: A procedural error or omission occurred that significantly impacted the outcome. There is new evidence, unknown or unavailable during the investigation, that could substantially impact the finding or sanction. A summary of this new evidence and its potential impact upon the investigation must be included in the appeal. The sanctions imposed are substantially disproportionate to the severity of the violation. The original finding and sanction/responsive actions will stand if the appeal is not timely or is not based on the grounds listed above, and such a finding and sanction/responsive action(s) are final. When a party requests an appeal, the other party (parties) will be notified and given an opportunity to respond. For students: In cases involving student conduct, a person designated by the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Affairs will review the appeal request(s). For employees: In cases involving employee conduct, a person designated by the President will review the appeal request(s).Where the designee finds that at least one of the grounds is met, and proceeds with the appeal, additional principles governing the hearing of appeals include the following: The original decision will only be changed when there is a compelling justification to do so. Appeals are not intended to be full re-hearings of the complaint. Appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation or record of the original hearing and pertinent documentation regarding the grounds for appeal. Sanctions will not be imposed pending the outcome of the appeal. Interim and/or protective actions may be imposed and/or continued as appropriate. The designee will render a decision within ten college days to the Title IX Officer who will normally provide written notice of the appeal to all parties within three college days from the date of the appeal review. All parties will be informed of whether the grounds for an appeal are accepted and the results of the appeal decision. Once an appeal is decided, the outcome is final: further appeals are not permitted under this policy. 7. Failure to Complete Sanctions All respondents are expected to comply with conduct sanctions within the time frame specified in their written notice. Failure to follow through on conduct sanctions by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect, or any other reason, may result in additional sanctions and/or suspension, expulsion, and/or termination from the College. For students, failure to comply may result in transcript notation and/or a hold to prevent future registration. V. Remedial Actions In addition to the interim actions outlined in Section IV.C.1.b, the Title IX Officer (or designee) may provide remedial actions intended to address the short or long-term effects of harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation. That is, remedial actions may be taken at the conclusion of the process in addition to any actions that may have been taken on an interim basis, in order to redress harm to the complainant and the community and to prevent further harassment or violations. Remedial actions may also be used when, in the judgment of the Title IX Officer (or designee), the safety or well-being of any member(s) of the campus community may be jeopardized by the presence on campus of the respondent or the ongoing activity of a student organization whose behavior is in question. These remedies may include referral to counseling and health services or to the Employee Assistance Program, altering the housing situation of a respondent student, (or the alleged complainant, if desired), altering work arrangements, providing campus escorts, implementing contact limitations between the parties, or offering adjustments to academic deadlines and/or course schedules. VI. Statement of Rights for Complainants and Respondents Both complainants and respondents will be afforded the following rights under this policy: To be treated with respect by College officials To take advantage of campus support resources (such as Counseling Services and College Health Services for students, or EAP services for employees) To experience a safe educational and work environment To have an advisor (students) or representative (employees) during this process To refuse to have an allegation resolved through informal procedures To be free from retaliation To have complaints heard in substantial accordance with these procedures 33To reasonable and necessary participation in the process VII. Records In implementing this policy, records of all complaints, resolutions, and hearings will be kept by the Title IX Officer indefinitely in the Office of Compliance and Equity Management. Appendix Good Samaritan The welfare of students in our community is of paramount importance. At times, students on and off campus may need assistance. The College encourages students to offer help and assistance to others in need. Sometimes, students are hesitant to offer assistance to others, for fear that they may get themselves in trouble (for example, as student who has been drinking underage might hesitate to help take a victim of sexual misconduct to the Campus security). The College pursues a policy of limited immunity for students who offer help to others in need. While policy violations cannot be overlooked, the College will provide educational options, rather than punishment, to those who offer their assistance to others in need. Risk Reduction Tips Risk reduction tips can often take a victim-blaming tone, even unintentionally. With no intention to victim-blame, and with recognition that only those who commit sexual violence are responsible for those actions, these suggestions may nevertheless help you to reduce your risk experiencing a non-consensual sexual act. Below, suggestions to avoid committing a non-consensual sexual act are also offered: Know your sexual intentions and limits. You have the right to say \"NO\" to any unwanted sexual contact. If you are uncertain of what you want, ask your partner to respect your feelings. Communicate your limits firmly and directly. If you say \"No,\" say it like you mean it. Avoid giving mixed messages. Back up your words with a firm voice and clear body language. Do not assume that someone will automatically know how you feel or will eventually \"get the message\" without you having to say anything. Remember that some people think that drinking, dressing provocatively, or going to your or your date's room is saying you are willing to have sex. Be clear up front about your limits in such situations. Listen to your gut feelings. If you feel uncomfortable or think you might be at risk, leave the situation immediately and go to a safe place. Don't be afraid to \"make waves\" if you feel threatened. If you feel you are being pressured or coerced into sexual activity, don't hesitate to state your feelings and leave the situation. Attend large parties with friends you trust. Agree to \"look out\" for one another. Leave with the group, not alone. Avoid leaving with people that you don't know very well. Take care of your friends and ask that they take care of you. A real friend will challenge you if you are about to make a mistake. Respect them when they do. If you find yourself in the position of being the initiator of sexual behavior, you owe sexual respect to your potential partner. These suggestions may help you to reduce your risk for being accused of sexual misconduct: Clearly communicate your intentions to your sexual partner and give them a chance to clearly relate their intentions to you. Understand and respect personal boundaries. DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS about consent; about someone's sexual availability; about whether they are attracted to you; about how far you can go or about whether they are physically and/or mentally able to consent. If there are any questions or ambiguity then you DO NOT have consent. Mixed messages from your partner are a clear indication that you should stop, defuse any sexual tension and communicate better. You may be misreading them. They may not have figured out how far they want to go with you yet. You must respect the timeline for sexual behaviors with which they are comfortable. Don't take advantage of someone's drunkenness or drugged state, even if they did it to themselves. Realize that your potential partner could be intimidated by you, or fearful. You may have a power advantage simply because of your gender or size. Don't abuse that power. Understand that consent to some form of sexual behavior does not automatically imply consent to any other forms of sexual behavior. Silence and passivity cannot be interpreted as an indication of consent. Read your potential partner carefully, paying attention to verbal and non-verbal communication and body language. Sexual Offense Educational Programming Because Northampton Community College recognizes sex discrimination in all its forms as important issues, the College offers annual educational programming to a variety of groups such as: staff, security, Residence Life, Faculty, incoming students, resident and off-campus students and, members of student organizations. Visit www.Notalone.gov for more information and resources on avoiding and preventing sexual assault. Sex Discrimination educational programming may address matters such as: a definition of what constitutes sex discrimination, the causes of sex discrimination, myths involved with sex discrimination, prevention, the relationship between sex discrimination and alcohol use, what to do if you are assaulted, the nature of a rape examination, an explanation of the College sex discrimination policy, how to file charges within the College, its conduct system, and/or with the local police department, men's issues and sexual assault, and campus community resources to assist both the survivor and the accused. Federal Enforcer The U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is the federal agency charged with enforcing compliance with Title IX. 34 Individuals with complaints of this nature always have the right to file a formal complaint with the United States Department Education: Office for Civil Rights (OCR) 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202-1100 Approval of Special Studies Courses Policy and Procedure for Special Studies Courses Special Studies courses may be established for 1, 2, 3 or 4 credits and will have a course designation of 19X or 29X. The courses are entitled \"Special Studies in (Departmental Name)\". On the schedule and the transcript, the name of the specific topic would be included after the course title, e.g. Special Studies in Economics - Econometrics. Students may not apply more than 12 credit hours of Special Studies toward a degree. Special Studies topics which are later approved as separate courses in substantially the same form shall not be counted toward this limit. A Special Studies course may be offered once, or upon the approval of the dean, twice. A Special Studies course may not compete with an existing college course or another Special Studies course. In departments that do not already have Special Studies courses, the provision for such courses may be established within each department by means of a Curriculum Committee proposal submitted through normal channels. To propose a specific Special Studies course, follow the procedures listed below: The steps must be completed before the publication deadline for the schedule for the semester in which the course is to be offered. A faculty member wishing to offer a Special Studies course must submit a completed course outline to the dean of the division. After approval by the dean, the course outline is considered by the appropriate cluster. The Cluster will decide the appropriateness of the offering and recommend to the Dean the semester of offering. The recommendations of the cluster are forwarded by the division dean to the curriculum committee for approval. Final Examinations Final Examinations Faculty members are encouraged to use the last week of instruction for assimilative or integrative activities wherever instructionally appropriate. No tests of any kind, except for short (less than 15 minutes) quizzes or science lab practicals, may be given during the last week of instruction. All courses will end with some \"culminating experience,\" a final examination, project-based assessment or portfolio that integrates the learning of the whole semester. Final Exam Each course will be assigned a time during the final exam period, at which a final exam may be given. Culminating Experiences other than seated final exams Final papers and projects may be due on the \"Project due date\" on the first day of finals. Performance-, production-, and critique-based \"culminating experiences,\" which may run the course of days or several weeks, may begin before the final exam period. 35Grading/Grade Changes/Grade Appeal Grading System A plus/minus grading system is used at the College. Using the plus/minus system is an option for faculty, not a requirement. Grades will be available online at MyNCC at the end of each regular semester. At the end of the seventh week of classes, faculty will submit to the Records Office the names of all students whose performance in a particular course to date puts them at risk of failing the course. The Records Office will communicate this information to those students by the end of the eighth week of the semester. Grade Evaluation Points/Credit Hour A Superior 4.0 A\u00ad 3.7 B+ 3.3 B Above Average 3.0 B\u00ad 2.7 C+ 2.3 C Average 2.0 C\u00ad 1.7 D+ 1.3 D Below Average 1.0 F Fail 0.0 P Pass I1Incomplete N Not released R Released X No grade submitted IP In progress L Audited T Transfer Credits Z Successful completion of course challenge process AZ4Successful completion of course challenge process 4.0 BZ4Successful completion of course challenge process 3.0 CZ4Successful completion of course challenge process 2.0 TZ Credits accepted through articulation agreement W2Withdrawal WP3Withdrawal, Passing WF3Withdrawal, Failing Grade* Course repeated \u00ad this grade IS NOT included in GPA Grade**Course repeated \u00ad this grade IS included in GPA 1. An incomplete grade (I) is given only when the student had obtained, in advance, the permission of the instructor to postpone completion of specific course work for a valid reason. (Refer to Incomplete policy.) 2. A student may withdraw, or be withdraw administratively, from a class in which he or she is enrolled through the 90% point in the instructional period. 3. Through summer 2007, students who withdrew from a course through the first 2/3 of the instructional period received a grade of W. After that point, and through the end of the semester, student received a grade of WP or WF. The grade of WF counted as a grade of F in the student's grade point average. 4. Grade value for completion of developmental math modular units awarded through course challenge process beginning Fall 2014. Grade Changes Any grade changes by a faculty member must be made within five months of the end of the semester in which the original grade was issued. Withdrawal from a course is a final action. No change to the final grade is permitted in the case of a Withdrawal. Grade Appeal Grades are assigned by the course instructor. Students may appeal a final grade only in the cases where they are alleging a serious computational error in the grade or in cases where they allege unfair treatment in the application of a course policy or procedure. When a student wishes to appeal a grade, final or part of a semester's work, he or she must follow the appeal procedures for grades, and those involved in the appeal may recommend only the following actions:The assigned grade may be supported. The faculty member may be asked to reconsider the grade in question. Appeal procedure\u00adgrades36-AStep 1 If a student wishes to appeal a grade, he or she must make an appointment and meet with the faculty member within ten working days. To appeal final grades or grades assigned in the last week of the semester, the student must make an appointment and meet with the faculty member at a formal meeting during the first week of the next regular semester unless arrangements can be made to meet prior to that time. If no agreement can be reached, the student may file an appeal in the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and proceed to Step 2. Note: working day is defined as any day when a full schedule of classes are in session (this excludes Saturdays and Sundays). Step 2 Within three working days of the meeting with the faculty member, the student may request in writing that the appropriate dean should call the meeting within five working days to include the student, faculty member, and program director, if any. After this meeting, the dean will send all parties involved a written recommendation within three working days. Students who do not agree with the recommendation in Step 2 may appeal to the Academic Appeals Committee within three working days. This appeal must be submitted, in writing, to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Step 3 Students initiate appeals to the Academic Appeals Committee (within three days of notification of outcome of Step 2) by requesting a hearing through the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. A hearing will be scheduled as quickly as possible, and all parties to the appeal will be informed of the date, time, and place of the meeting. It is the responsibility of the student and the person(s) whose decision(s) is (are) being appealed to provide the committee with evidence, documentary or otherwise. The appellant may be accompanied by a college friend.Having heard the cases of appellant and objects of appeal, the committee will deliberate in private and recommend a decision to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, whose decision will be final unless different from the recommendation of the committee in such cases the student may appeal to the President, whose decision is final.The Vice President for Academic Affairs will communicate in writing a decision on the appeal no later than three working days after the hearing. Graduation Eligibility To be eligible for graduation, a student must meet the minimum number of credits for a degree, certificate, or specialized diploma and must earn a graduation GPA of 2.00 (only courses for the credential are calculated in the graduation GPA). Developmental coursework does not count toward graduation requirements. These specific requirements cannot be waived. Waiver of Graduation Requirements Policy and Procedure Policy to request course substitution/waiver for graduation A student may file a graduation waiver to use one course to substitute for one required in their program major, or to waive a requirement without substitution. This request must be accompanied by a complete justification for the request. Waiver of Graduation Requirements Procedure To petition to waive graduation requirements, a student must complete the Graduation Waiver request form which can be obtained in the Records Office, Monroe Enrollment Office or online at www.northampton.edu/register. The completed form must be submitted to the Records Office. It will be reviewed by the program dean, the instructor, and the dean responsible for the course(s) for which waiver is sought. If the reviewing parties do not reach a consensus decision, then the request will be referred by the Records Office to the Academic Appeals Committee for disposition. That body will recommend approval or disapproval of the petition. Decision of the Academic Appeals Committee will be final. Student will be notified by Records of final decision. Honors at Graduation See Academic Recognition 36-BIncomplete Policy An incomplete grade of I is issued after a student requests it and a faculty member agrees to allow completion of specific course work the student did not complete due to valid, unforeseen circumstances. These circumstances may include: serious illness of the student, serious illness or death in the student's immediate family, etc. The request must be made for the Incomplete grade before the last class meeting of the semester. The faculty member may approve or deny the request. If the request is approved, the faculty member will outline, on the Assignment of Incomplete Grade form, the work the student must complete. The faculty member will send the Assignment of Incomplete Grade form to the Records Office who will then communicate with the student. The deadline for completing the course requirements is no more than five months - or sooner as designated by the faculty member - after the date grades were due in the semester in which the I grade was issued. The faculty member will designate that the incomplete grade become a specific letter grade if the work is not completed. This grade may not be a withdrawal (W). An Incomplete grade in a prerequisite course may make a student ineligible to take the subsequent course. Placement Policy For detailed information, see Placement Policy . Prerequisite Policy Students are required to have fulfilled the prerequisites for each course in which they enroll for credit. If a student enrolls in a course without having fulfilled the prerequisites, the instructor or the Registrar may withdraw the student from the course. A prerequisite may be waived in special circumstances by the course instructor or the dean in the absence of the instructor, in response to a student's request. If the waived prerequisite is a required course in the student's program, the student must satisfy the requirement with a course approved by the dean. Repeated Courses The College allows a student to repeat any course once for any reason*. This is subject to availability in limited enrollment courses (see special policy for readmission, reentry into limited enrollment courses). A student, who fails to earn credit or to satisfy a grade prerequisite after enrolling in a course for the second time may not take the course for one academic year after the last attempt. Grades for all repeated courses will appear on the student transcript. The credit hours for the course may be counted only once unless the course description states otherwise. Only the highest grade earned will be used in calculation of the cumulative grade point average. Appeals to this policy may be made to the Director of Advising & Transfer Services who, in consultation with the appropriate faculty, will make a decision. Further appeals can be made to the Vice President for Academic Affairs and that decision shall be final. *Except for Allied Health Students (refer to Academic Dismissal from Allied Health Programs Policy) Re-Admission, Re-Entry into Limited Enrollment Courses Any student who does not successfully complete a major course* in a program which has limited enrollment may retake that course only if space is available. Priority will be given to students entering the program for the first time and to those students who have successfully completed the core courses and have maintained continuous enrollment. * A major course is a course which carries the prefix of the student's program. Withdrawals Schedule Change/Withdrawal A change of class from one class section to another is accomplished only with approval of the Records Office. Failure to seek official approval may result in the recording of an \"F\" grade. No courses may be added to a class schedule after the first week of a semester or equivalent time in short-term classes.Students may withdraw from classes in which they are enrolled through the 90% point of the semester (the end of the 14th week in a 15 week semester, or equivalent in courses that run on a non-standard schedule) and an instructor may issue a withdrawal for poor attendance through the same period. Any student who officially withdraws, or is withdrawn by the instructor during this period will receive a grade of W for the course. Academic Dismissal from Allied Health Programs (Nursing, Dental Hygiene, Medical Assistant, Radiography, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Funeral Service, Licensed Massage Therapy, and Veterinary Technician) Any student who does not successfully complete* two (2) courses (either two different courses or the same course twice), that carry the prefix of the student's Allied Health program, regardless of when in the program curriculum the unsuccessful attempt occurs, will be dismissed from his/her Allied Health program. An unsuccessful course completion for the purposes of this policy is defined as a final course grade of an \"F,\" or \"W\". 37Student Right to Know and Campus Security Act Graduation rates, transfer out rates, and campus crime data required by the Student Right to Know and Campus Security Act are available upon request from the Records Office, 610.861.5494, the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, 610.861.4558, or Campus Security. 2014 Annual Crime Report (PDF) Student Rights and Responsibilities A student has the right to pursue an education in an environment that is conducive to the free flow of information and ideas. At Northampton Community College, a student is encouraged to express him or herself through speech and actions and to actively participate in decisions affecting the educational process of the College. With rights come responsibilities. A student has the responsibility to realize that his or her actions must not interfere with the College's function as an educational institution and with the rights of others. The current student handbook contains the full student's rights and responsibilities document. Policy on Student Professional Conduct Documented evidence of a student's failure to conduct herself/himself in accordance with professional codes of conduct (i.e. Departmental and Host Facilities Code of Ethics, Policies on Clinical Procedures, Departmental Policies and Procedures, etc.) could result in serious academic penalties, up to and including failure in the course or dismissal from the academic program. If a student wishes to appeal any action taken under this policy, he/she should follow the procedures for appeal of grades. Transfer Recommendation Policy To receive an unconditional recommendation for transfer from the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, a student must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 and no prior disciplinary record at NCC. Students who do not satisfy the two aforementioned requirements may receive a conditional transfer recommendation.

An undergraduate degree is comprised of three parts: courses in the major, elective courses, and courses in the General Education Core Curriculum. Major courses define the program of study. Students choose electives that fit their individual interests. The General Education Core Curriculum is the part of the academic experience that all students have in common. The GE Core defines an important set of knowledge and skills that will help our graduates to continue learning, adapt to change, and become citizens who can make wise choices and contribute to their community. The General Education Core Curriculum is designed to go hand in hand with the major courses to develop skills that will serve students in their academic study, careers, and in their lives. Though in some designated GE Core courses the focus will be on particular outcomes, we expect that the knowledge and skills that are part of the GE Core Curriculum will be reinforced throughout the other major courses and electives Courses satisfying various General Education Core requirements are listed below by category; such requirements must be satisfied by selecting courses from among the listings below. Unless otherwise specified, they are applicable to all degrees (A.A./A.S./A.A.S.). General Education Core Goals and Learning Outcomes I. Knowledge of Arts, Cultures and the Natural World ARTS & HUMANITIES Goal: Students should understand both the creative process and how works of human imagination and thought from diverse cultures, places, and times express varieties of human experience. Learning Outcomes: Students will discuss, analyze and interpret works that confront, express, and examine human experience. Students will describe and explain the ways that language, literature, philosophy, or the visual and performing arts challenge or reinforce specific cultural or historic values and conditions. SOCIAL SCIENCE Goal: Students will demonstrate knowledge of Societies and Institutions Over Time (SIT) and the Scientific Study of Human Behavior (SSHB). Learning Outcomes: Students will identify and apply social science theories and concepts to behavioral or societal issues. (SIT & SSHB) Students will explain how a social science discipline describes and analyzes social change or human behavior. Students will describe how people's experiences and perspectives are shaped by sex, gender, ethnicity, class, age, race, culture and other factors. Note: Social science courses must address the first outcome and one of the two remaining outcomes. SCIENCE Goal: Students will demonstrate a working knowledge of scientific principles and concepts and be able to apply them to daily situations. Learning Outcomes: Students will explain the scientific method, recognizing the potential for uncertainty in the scientific inquiry. Students will apply basic field and laboratory skills used for collecting and analyzing data according to the particular discipline. DIVERSITY AND GLOBAL AWARENESS Goal: Students will demonstrate an understanding of human diversity and an awareness of global issues through analysis of arts, histories, cultures, geographies, economics, medicine, scientific data and/or institutions. Learning Outcomes: Students will discuss and explain how the diverse range of human differences influences the historical and current formation of artistic, economic, social, scientific, cultural or political institutions. Students will examine how the range of human differences influences each individual's experience of equality and inequality within a society, its institutions, or its cultures. Students will analyze how individuals and institutions have addressed persistent global challenges. Note: to carry a diversity designation, the course needs to address at least one of the three outcomes. II. Intellectual and Practical Skills COMMUNICATION Goal: Students will present and support ideas in an organized and coherent manner consistent with the intended audience and purpose in both speaking and writing. 43Learning Outcomes: Students will identify, analyze, and choose supporting materials in written and spoken communication. Students will organize information with a central idea or thesis. Students will differentiate among various audience needs in word choice, level of explanation, and method of presentation. COMPUTER LITERACY Goal: Students will use computer technology as a tool for communication and productivity both professionally and personally. Learning Outcomes: Students will demonstrate knowledge of computer concepts and terminology. Students will create, store, retrieve, and print formatted documents. Students will evaluate ethical uses of technology. QUANTITATIVE LITERACY Goal: Students will interpret and analyze quantitative data to solve problems. Learning Outcomes Students will interpret, analyze, and draw conclusions about data presented as words, abstract symbols, tables or graphs. Students will use mathematics to model events and solve problems. Students will communicate using mathematical language, symbols, data, and graphs. INFORMATION LITERACY Goal: Students will demonstrate research skills in gathering, evaluating, and using information. Learning Outcomes Students will locate and identify information Students will evaluate source information and incorporate it into their work. Students will use source information in an ethical and legal fashion. CRITICAL THINKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING Goal: Students will think critically and propose solutions to open-ended problems. Learning Outcomes: Students will analyze and evaluate information, ideas and arguments in order to form conclusions. Students will design and evaluate a plan that addresses an open-ended problem. Note: to carry a critical thinking designation, the course must address at least one of the two outcomes.

Education Overview Students intending to prepare to become teachers of children from infancy through twelfth grade may start their educational preparation at Northampton Community College. NCC offers five distinct degree programs that will prepare students for a variety of teaching positions in settings such as public schools, parochial and private schools, as well as childcare centers and Head Start programs. Our degree programs are: Early Childhood Education: Infant to Grade 4, AAS Middle Level Education: Grades 4 to 8, AA Secondary Education, AA Secondary Education: Math & Science, AS Special Education Paraeducator, AAS The information presented below answers some questions students frequently ask when thinking about a career in education. Are you not sure which level or grade you want to teach? Many students that come to NCC interested in teaching as a career are unsure of which grades they would be best suited to teach. Such students should take EDUC115 Education for All Students , a course which explores all grade levels, including pre-kindergarten through high school teaching. EDUC115 gives students real world experience through observations in the schools, which often helps students to determine which level of teaching is best for them. Are you sure that you want to teach young children, Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 4 and/or aged infancy to age 9 in child care or Head Start? Students who are sure that they want to work with younger students up to Grade 4 may enter directly into the Early Childhood Education: 92 Infant to Grade 4, associate in applied science degree program. The Early Childhood Education program provides extensive opportunities to observe and work with young children during your time at NCC. Upon graduation from NCC students have two choices: immediately obtain a teaching position in a child care center or at a Head Start program, or, transfer to a bachelor's degree program at a college or university to complete the requirements for teacher certification. Do you have a subject area that you think you want to teach? Students that think they may want to teach a subject or content area (mathematics, science, English, social studies, etc) may consider teaching at either the middle school or high school level. The Middle School Grades 4 to 8 certification is new to Pennsylvania. Middle level certification will allow teachers to teach the last two grades of elementary school (grades 4 and 5) and all grades of middle school. The Middle Level Education: Grades 4 to 8 NCC degree gives students a strong foundation in mathematics, science, language arts, and social science. Students then transfer to a bachelor's degree program at college or university to complete the requirements for teacher certification. Students intending to become high school teachers should select either the NCC degree in Secondary Education (for those that want to teach English, history, foreign language, or social studies), or, the Secondary Education: Math & Science degree. After graduation from NCC students then transfer to a bachelor's degree program at college or university to complete the requirements for teacher certification. What teaching positions could I obtain with an associate degree from NCC? Students who wish to enter directly into a job after completing an associate degree from NCC have several options. The Early Childhood Education: Infant to Grade 4 prepares students to work in childcare centers and Head Start programs.NCC also offers the gateway to a career as a paraeducator or teacher assistants through the Special Education Paraeducator degree. For students who wish to help classroom teachers, the position of teacher assistant offers another opportunity to work in schools.Students who have completed the Middle Level Education: Grades 4-8, the Secondary Education, or the Secondary Education: Math & Science associate in science degree may also gain employment as teacher assistants. Northampton offers a wide range of programs for students intending to make teaching a career. Education - Early Childhood Education: Infant to Grade 4 Education & Academic Success Degree awarded: Associate in Applied Science; Certificate and Specialized Diplomas conferred Program Narrative Teaching young children is rewarding and inspiring! Our highly qualified faculty prepares students to be effective teachers of children aged infant to nine years.
