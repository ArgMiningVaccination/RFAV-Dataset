It's the right choice for me during this pandemic.", "sitename": "Port Wellness Acupuncture", "date": "2021-02-01", "cleaned_text": "I just received my first dose of the SARS Covid-19 vaccine... and that puts me on \"Team Moderna.\" I believe the best medicine is what is appropriate under the circumstances. For me in this pandemic, the best medicine is to be vaccinated against the Covid-19 virus. I went to Dodger Stadium (along with thousands of others) to get my first shot this weekend. Shout out to Mike, his painless needle technique, and his efficient and easy manner! But let me say this: I am an acupuncturist, I take [herbs](https://portwellnessacupuncture.com/herbal-medicine/) and vitamins, I get acupuncture regularly, and I believe diet, exercise, and mindset have a lot to do with staying healthy. I've lifted weights, and also found great strength from a yoga practice. But I also believe there is a time and a place for Western medicine. I was grateful for emergency surgery when my baby was footling breach. I was grateful for orthopedic surgery when my family history of arthritis caught up with me and I needed a hip replacement (at about the same age my father needed one). I closed my office in March, and reopened in early June. Since then, I am observing safety/cleaning protocols, wearing a mask whenever I go out, running air filters in my office, staying socially distant, washing hands frequently, and only going out for groceries and a few doctor/dentist appointments. I'm also taking specific Chinese herbs to support and protect my immune system. I like to think I'm using the best practices of conventional and complimentary medicine for staying well, protecting me, my family and my patients. No one medicine is the best at everything. Your personal values, experience, and circle of influences will impact how you make decisions and what actions you decide to take. The severity of your health issues will also help determine your best course of action. My circle of influences include two MDs in public health who take the pandemic and the vaccines very seriously. I trust their perspective. Theirs were just two of the opinions that I considered. Are you going to get vaccinated when you are eligible? Do you know anyone that has gotten vaccinated yet? Are you taking any additional vitamins or herbs to stay well? Please tell me in the comments below. This was my experience: after a few hours, my arm began to hurt at the injection site, nothing serious. I grew slightly fuzzy-headed and tired, too tired to go for my daily walk. So I just hung out and took it easy. Lots of tea. Early to bed. Nothing challenging. I always honor fatigue: it's the easiest and most successful remedy I have to to fight the onset of a cold or flu, or the reaction to a vaccine! Day 2 my arm is less sore, most of my energy is back and I'm glad it was sunny enough to go for a walk. So I'm looking forward to Day 3 being pretty much back to normal. It's raining lightly, otherwise I'm ready for my walk! Whatever you decide about the vaccine, may you be safe and free from disease. May your heart remain open. May you make healthy choices that are the best for you. May you have ease of body and mind. May you be at peace. Sticker photo by "}
