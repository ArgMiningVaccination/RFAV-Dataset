We do not know how soon they will be available. We are currently only providing Pfizer and Moderna Bivalent doses, which is the formulation approved fall of 2022. If you are immunocompromised and interested in getting an additional booster of the current vaccine, please register below. Doses are available to anyone as either a primary dose, first bivalent booster, or those over age 65 when it has been more than 6 months since the previous booster dose. Many individuals are waiting until the new formulation is available, as we don't know what timing recommendations will be once they are FDA approved. Please DO NOT sign up now for the new vaccine- this will be updated once the new formula is available. [Please follow this link to schedule Pfizer bivalent doses for those over age 12.](https://hipaa.jotform.com/form/222485127027150) [Click to schedule Moderna Bivalent dose for those over age 6.](https://hipaa.jotform.com/222484609116153) RSV (respiratory Syncytial Virus) Vaccines RSV Vaccines have recently been approved for individuals 60 and over, and it is recommended by the CDC that you have a conversation with your healthcare professional (physician or pharmacist) to determine your risk of disease and benefit from the vaccine. Individuals with heart or lung conditions or living in shared housing such as assisted living facilities are at highest risk for hospitalization and complications from RSV. A link to schedule will be available once the vaccine is in stock and available at Uptown Pharmacy.

[Click here for Influenza vaccination paperwork.](https://hipaa.jotform.com/212374845443155) FLu (Afluria\u00ae,Fluarix\u00ae,FluLaval\u00ae,FLUZONE\u00ae) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that everyone 6 months of age and older, with rare exception, should receive a flu vaccination every year \u2014 even if you have never had the flu.\u00b9 We are able to vaccinate those ages 5 and over. High dose flu (FluzonE-HD\u00ae) A higher dose for a stronger immune response to the flu than the standard FLUZONE\u00ae vaccine.\u00b2 As you get older, your immune system weakens.\u00b2 Which means your antibody response after getting the traditional flu vaccine is not as high as it used to be.\u00b3 FLUZONE-HD\u00ae vaccine is made for people 65+ and it helps promote a stronger immune response to the flu than Fluzone vaccine. Pneumonia (Prevnar 13\u00ae Prevnar 20\u00ae & PNEUMOVAX\u00ae23) As you age, you take extra steps, like eating right and exercising, to help prevent disease. But even if you take good care of yourself, if you're 65 or older, or under age 65 with other risk factors, take one more step with a pneumonia vaccine. Guidelines have recently changed- ask one of our pharmacist which vaccine is right for you. Shingles (Shingrix\u00ae) 99% of people over 50 years of age are living with the virus that causes shingles with 1 in 3 people will get shingles in their lifetime. SHINGRIX\u00ae is the first shingles vaccine approved by the FDA in more than 10 years. SHINGRIX\u00ae is the only shingles vaccine proven to be up to 90% effective in clinical trials. SHINGRIX\u00ae is given as a 2-dose series, with the second shot administered 2 to 6 months after the first shot. To ensure you get the protection against shingles offered by SHINGRIX\u00ae , it's important to get both shots. Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertusis (Tdap) is indicated as a booster immunization as a single dose in persons over 10 years of age. Family members are the primary source of pertussis in infants. Studies show that when the source can be identified, family members are the source in up to 83% of cases transmitted to infants. Infants under 6 months of age are most vulnerable to complications from pertussis. We would need a prescription order for anyone under the age of 12. Typhoid (Vivotif\u00ae) VIVOTIF\u00ae (Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a) is indicated for immunization of adults and children greater than 6 years of age against disease caused by Salmonella Typhi. Routine typhoid vaccination is not recommended in the United States of America. Selective immunization against typhoid fever is recommended for the following groups: Travelers to areas in which there is a recognized risk of exposure to S Typhi Persons with intimate exposure (eg, household contact) to an S Typhi carrier Microbiology Labradorians who work frequently with S Typhi There is no evidence to support the use of typhoid vaccine to control common source outbreaks, disease following natural disasters, or in persons attending rural summer camps. Typhoid vaccination does require a prescription from your physician. References: CDC.
