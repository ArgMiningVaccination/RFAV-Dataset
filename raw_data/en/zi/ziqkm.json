Getting run down with a cold or flu is a drag\u2014but catching a bad case of [the latest bug going around](https://www.thehealthy.com/cold-flu/when-is-flu-season-2022/) can be more dangerous than you may think. The US is currently experiencing the [greatest number of flu hospitalizations in a decade](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In part, this is because the body aches, fever, congestion, and fatigue common with [colds and flus weaken your body](https://www.thehealthy.com/cold-flu/the-flu-virus/) and increase inflammation, which can make any pre-existing medical conditions worse. For instance, 2018 research in the prestigious [New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1702090) suggested that your risk of a heart attack is six times higher when you have the flu. Still, when the flu's taxing your body, you can also develop complications that lead to illnesses [like pneumonia](https://www.thehealthy.com/respiratory/pneumonia-symptoms/). Nothing can guarantee that you won't get sick. But research shows that [strengthening your immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7646052/) through lifestyle practices can considerably lower your chances of catching a bug\u2014and reduce the severity and duration of [symptoms](https://www.thehealthy.com/cold-flu/surprising-common-cold-symptoms/) if you do get sick. When it comes to avoiding infections, \"it's suspected that the terrain may be more important than the organism,\" says Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, a board-certified internist. This means that your body's immune strength is likely more important than [how strong a bug](https://www.thehealthy.com/cold-flu/cold-symptoms/) is, he explains. So, how do we keep our immune system in full fighting form? Doctors share with [The Healthy @Reader's Digest](https://www.thehealthy.com/newsletter/?int_source=direct&int_medium=thehealthy.com&int_campaign=nlhlt_20221101_generalarticlenlsignup&int_placement=incontent) their daily immune-boosting habits to keep their systems in shape all year long. [The Best Foods for Your Liver, According to Hepatologists and a Dietitian](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/best-foods-for-liver-health-hepatologists/) Eat the rainbow Fueling your body with a nutritious diet is incredibly important for immune function...but no matter how healthy your diet is, balance is key. Research shows that lack or [deficiencies of minerals and vitamins](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2021.751374/full) negatively impacts immune response. Fortunately, eating enough of everything you need doesn't have to be difficult, according to Deepak Chopra, MD, author of the January 2023 book [Living in the Light](https://www.deepakchopra.com/book/living-in-the-light/) and co-founder of NeverAlone. He turns to a diet focused on plant-based eating featuring all [seven colors of the rainbow](https://www.thehealthy.com/food/eat-the-rainbow/) and a split between various flavors like sweet, sour, salty, and bitter foods. For when you need an extra boost, Dr. Teitelbaum says he optimizes with [nutrients for the immune system](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/vitamins/vitamins-and-supplements-nutritionists-take-to-boost-their-immune-system/). \"Especially important would be getting at least 15 milligrams of zinc, 200 milligrams of vitamin C, 3000 units of vitamin D, and 150 \u00b5g of selenium daily,\" he says. \" [Elderberry](https://www.thehealthy.com/alternative-medicine/elderberry-syrup/) (300 milligrams) can also be very protective.\" Stay hydrated all day Every process in our body needs water to function well, including the immune system. When we're exposed to a viral infection, our first line of defense is the immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies, says Dr. Teitelbaum. \"[They're] like our Navy,\" he says, and they function best when we're [well-hydrated](https://www.thehealthy.com/hydration/stay-hydrated/). [The 3 Best Hydrating Beverages That Aren't Water, from a Certified Sports Dietitian](https://www.thehealthy.com/hydration/best-hydrating-beverages-not-water/) Feed your gut \"I take a [high-quality probiotic supplement](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/probiotics/types-of-probiotics/) daily, as well as incorporate [prebiotic](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/probiotics/prebiotic-foods/) and [probiotic foods](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/probiotic-filled-foods/) to boost my gut microbiome,\" says Kavita Desai, PharmD, a women's health specialist and founder of Revivele. Research from 2021 in [Nutrients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33803407/) said it's estimated that our gut (also known as your intestinal tract or digestive system) contains 70% to 80% of the [body's immune cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33803407/). For your gut to be healthy, it needs a diverse microbiome of good bacteria like prebiotics and probiotics. \"Another great way to [boost gut health](https://www.thehealthy.com/digestive-health/how-to-reset-your-gut-doctor/) is to eat a high-fiber diet,\" she says. \"For me, that means incorporating [flaxseed](https://www.amazon.com/Bobs-Red-Mill-Flaxseed-Organic/dp/B075XGQSNN/ref=sr_1_15_mod_primary_new?crid=1LXSQ9C7PEI7T&keywords=flaxseed&qid=1671652298&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sprefix=flaxseed%2Caps%2C421&sr=8-15) into morning smoothies and making sure I eat a variety of vegetables with every meal.\" Move whenever you can Studies show that getting just [20 minutes of exercise](https://www.thehealthy.com/exercise/exercise-boosts-immune-system/) has anti-inflammatory effects on our body, which pump up the immune system. \"I like to start each day with [a brisk walk](https://www.thehealthy.com/exercise/walking/is-walking-good-exercise/),\" Dr. Desai says. \"Not only is this great exercise, but it's an excellent way to boost mood and improve mental health,\" each of which plays a role in high immune function. \"Throughout the day, if I happen to be sitting a lot, I try to take a quick break every hour to move around or, oftentimes, I will stand while on a phone call or at my computer.\" [These Gentle Exercises May Be the Key to a Longer Life, Say Experts](https://www.thehealthy.com/exercise/why-mobility-exercises-personal-trainer/) Maintain a sleep schedule When we sleep, our body is able to repair damaged tissues and remove toxins that have accumulated throughout the day, says Katherine Hall, PhD, a sleep psychologist at Somnus Therapy. \"Studies also show that sleep improves immune cells known as T-cells, which fight off cells infected by viruses and other pathogens and help keep us healthy.\" But the amount of sleep you get is just as important as its quality\u2014and [2020 research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33054339/) showed that people who keep consistent sleep schedules ( [going to bed](https://www.thehealthy.com/sleep/benefits-going-to-bed-earlier/) and waking up at the same time daily) have stronger immune systems. [Can't Sleep? A New Study Found This Solution Was More Powerful Than Melatonin](https://www.thehealthy.com/sleep/insomnia/weighted-blanket-better-than-melatonin-study/) Manage stress \"Research has shown that short-term stress can activate our immune system\u2014but long-term stress will [contribute to suppressing it](https://www.thehealthy.com/mental-health/stress-eating-effects/),\" says Jeff Gladd, MD, an integrative medicine physician and chief medical officer at Fullscript. \"It's impossible to completely avoid or eliminate stress from our lives, but integrating exercise and daily mindfulness practices such as meditation and deep breathing can help us better cope with stress.\" Dr. Chopra recommends trying [yoga and breathing techniques](https://www.thehealthy.com/exercise/yoga/yoga-health-benefits-instructors/), as these \"activate the vagal nerves, overriding the stress response.\" In addition, he tries \"not to take myself too seriously\" by taking a beat when stress levels rise and watching something funny on Youtube. [10 Science-Backed Ways to Lower Your Stress This Instant (Really!)](https://www.thehealthy.com/mental-health/stress/lower-stress-science/) Prioritize social connection Our relationships have a powerful impact in [reducing stress levels](https://www.thehealthy.com/mental-health/stress/how-friends-relieve-stress-and-help-us-cope/), but isolating from others can also weaken your immune system, says Reuben K. Chen, MD, FAAPMR. \"Frequent exposure to different pathogens from contact with people can actually strengthen your immune function. Research published in [Frontiers in Psychology](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.634621/full) confirms that people who maintain healthy social connections actually produce more antibodies through their immune systems, helping to fight off disease and even live longer.
