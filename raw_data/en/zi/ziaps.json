A: Measles is a highly contagious, serious, viral respiratory illness that lives in the nose and throat of infectious people. Measles is spread through coughing and sneezing, and the virus has the ability to live in the air for nearly two hours after an infected person coughs or sneezes, thus infecting mass numbers of defenseless people in a short period of time. Q: What are the symptoms of measles? A: A person can present no symptoms of measles for nearly four days while infected. The symptoms of measles generally appear about 7-14 days after a person is infected. Measles typically begins with high fevers, coughing, a runny nose and red, infected eyes. Two to three days after symptoms arise, tiny white spots may appear inside one's mouth. Three to five days after symptoms arise, a rash of flat red spots appears across the body, typically starting from the top of the hairline and making its way down the body. Q: How can measles be prevented? A: The best measles the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. The MMR vaccine is most commonly given to children between 12 and 15 months of age, and the second booster dose between 4 and 6 years of age. UAB follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations, which recommends that all children get two doses of MMR. Adults who do not have evidence of immunity should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine. One dose of MMR proves to be 93% effective and two doses of MMR prove to be up to 97 percent effective in preventing measles. Currently, there is no antiviral drug to treat measles, adding to the severity of the disease. Q: What do I do if I think I/my child has measles? A: If you have reason to believe that you or your child are presenting any measles-related symptoms, do not visit any healthcare clinic unless instructed by a physician. Call your primary care physician to see if they recommend you coming in for examination; if so, you may be asked to enter through an isolated entrance to minimize risk of contagions spreading.

Q: How do I know if I am vaccinated? A: You should have immunization records to indicate that you did or did not receive the MMR vaccine. You can call your pediatrician or primary care doctor to ask for your records. If you are unable to locate those records, you can get your titer checked. This is a way to detect the amount of antibodies in a person's blood, which helps doctors know your immunity status. It is done through a standard and simple blood draw. From there, your physician can then determine if you are a candidate for another MMR dose. Q: Am I at risk for getting measles? A: If you have traveled internationally, are a healthcare worker or know that you are unvaccinated, you have a higher risk of contracting measles. To prevent measles, two doses of MMR are recommended by the Alabama Department of Public Health. Q: Do I need a booster MMR shot? A: Born in 1957 or earlier: You are presumed to be immune due to prior exposure. If worried, you can check your titer to see your status. You may be able to get another dose of MMR. Born from 1958 or later: You can get 1 dose of MMR, if no contraindications/factors to withhold medical treatment. Born 1989 or later: You are presumed to have received 2 doses of MMR. No additional vaccine is needed. Q: Will it be bad for me if I get a booster MMR shot, just to be safe? A: You cannot be over-vaccinated, so experts recommend getting an additional dose of MMR if you are unsure of your status. Q: I have heard that the MMR vaccine is bad for my child. Is that true? A: There is no link between receiving the MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorder. MMR is a safe and effective vaccine that can protect children and adults alike from highly contagious and sometimes deadly diseases. Q: I am pregnant, can I get the MMR vaccine? A: A person should not get the vaccine if they are severely immune-compromised, are pregnant or have experienced an allergic reaction to a previous MMR vaccine. They can talk with their health care provider about options for their specific situation. - Am I at risk for getting measles?
