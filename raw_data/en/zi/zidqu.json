Using a combination of mind-body tools centered around working with and regulating the nervous system, we will work together on a one-to one basis for a minimum of six weeks. Mind-body therapy will support you with mental and physical health conditions, and how they present uniquely through you. My work brings together yoga and somatic therapy, mindfulness, psychotherapeutic techniques, yogic philosophy, breathwork and the polyvagal therory of working with the nervous system. Is this for me? If you are suffering from and disconnected from your body because of a health condition or experience, I am here to guide you back home to it, to help you manage symptoms or address a root cause. If you are highly anxious and stressed, and it's impacting your mood, your health, your relationships, and your work, I am here to help you move through this. If you feel 'stuck' and find it difficult to untangle and express the challenges you are experiencing, I am here to help you unpick this. If you find yourself avoiding uncomfortable and distressing situations in your life, or parts of your body, I am here to help you address this. If you feel uncomfortable existing in your body and lack confidence, I am here to help you change how you change this. You as a whole and unique being I work using a whole-being and biopsychosocial approach to managing chronic conditions. This involves working with you as a unique human being, including exploring how past experiences, your previous and existing environments, and how previous emotional and physical traumas can manifest and present in your mind, body and body systems. We will also journey into deeper self-enquiry to unravel the ways in which symptoms may be influencing you - not only physically and mentally - but also behaviourally, energetically, socially, and spiritually. When you have a chronic health condition I know you want to have answers but this is a space where you can learn to trust it's going to be okay. I've learned through my own experiences and healing journey. I see you and hear you. From various traumatic and deeply uncomfortable experiences, I didn't have the support I needed to move through these, integrate them, learn and grow. I was emotionally chaotic and unable to express myself. My nervous system was completely dysregulated, I was often living in survival mode and running away from discomfort. This is when I decided to dive head first into learning about the intricate layers of the mind and body and various methods of self-work. I moved from a place of chronic anxiety and stress, dissociation and low self-worth to understanding myself on a whole new scale - knowing how to regulate my emotions, be with discomfort, develop strong boundaries and understand I will always be a work in progress. From all of my academic and personal work, I knew I wanted to support other people in their unique ways too. How I will help you Whatever you're experiencing, I can hold this with deep understanding, integrity and compassion, so together we can get you from a place of suffering to Understanding your body and mind better - using your body as a source of deep wisdom and enquiry Moving through and healing chronic emotional and physical conditions Understanding your unique nervous system so you're no longer operating in survival mode when things get challenging - increased tolerance to deep discomfort Identifying and working with unprocessed trauma Feeling seen, heard and supported so you fully accept all parts of yourself Feeling confident in expressing yourself - your needs, boundaries and desires Feeling empowered to make your own choices and decisions - trusting your intuition Having better relationships with lovers, friends or family Living a life of pleasure and trusting in your body and mind ALL of you is welcome here All of the parts and versions of you are welcome in this therapeutic space. When we bring all of these parts and give them space to exist and be seen, we learn self-compassion and self-acceptance. We no longer repress these parts. When we cultivate self-acceptance, we have more energy. Energy for ourselves, other people and energy for living a purposeful and pleasurable life. How I work I work intuitively and weave elements of Eastern and Western traditions, Spirit and science, combined with my own life experiences. I will always create a safe, open and compassionate space for you to work through whatever is arising during our sessions together. I have worked with women and men who have experienced chronic stress, anxiety, depression, PTSD, eating disorders, grief and loss, body dysmorphia, menstrual disorders, pregnancy loss, pregnancy, perinatal mental health. Integration is an important part of my work, and where I believe the magic lies when we are moving through challenge and discomfort - I will support and empower you to integrate anything from our sessions into your daily life, and will follow up with you two weeks after our final session. I prefer to work in long-term containers, but also have the option to choose a minimum of 6 sessions. I only have a small number of one-to-one clients at a time so I can support each client to the level they deserve. I work with clients both online and in-person.
