And whether you want to build a giant crystal grid altar or just bask in the prettiness of your crystal collection, there are so many [easy crystal rituals](https://www.bustle.com/p/5-cleansing-rituals-for-mercury-retrograde-winter-2018-to-help-you-survive-in-one-piece-13202653) that can help you harness their natural energy that no crystal lover has an excuse not to try one. After all, crystals have been touted as healing tools for centuries and used by people around the world. And despite being almost supernaturally gorgeous, they are naturally occurring in the Earth, and are known for their ability to store energy. Bustle spoke with Heather Askinosie and Timmi Jandro, co-founders of [Energy Muse](https://www.energymuse.com/) and co-authors of the book [Crystal Muse: Everyday Rituals To Tune In To The Real You](https://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Muse-Everyday-Rituals-Tune/dp/1401952380), to get their takes on crystal rituals. \"Healing crystals are a tool \u2014 they carry powerful vibrations that connect us to the Earth and nature's power,\" explains Energy Muse. \"Their energy holds and amplifies any intention you give them, making them the perfect tool to work with when you're looking to make changes in your life.\" This is why using crystals in ritual work has the potential to be so powerful. Different types of crystals already carry their own unique energy and purported healing properties inherently, but to actually work with that energy, it's best to program your crystals with a particular intention. As you continue to work with that crystal, you'll connect even more deeply with your intention. Combine that with the crystal's magic (which works to amplify your intention), and you've got yourself a healing tool. \"Crystals can take your intention-setting practice to the next level,\" continues Energy Muse. \"By programming your crystals with an intention, you can manifest your intentions and what you want in life.\" If you're new to Earth magic and working with healing tools, the idea of a \"ritual\" can be intimidating \u2014 but here's the deal: It's simply a way to connect with your spirituality or mysticism, in whatever form that takes within your personal practice. And rituals don't have to be super fancy, intense, and time-consuming. Using a single crystal and only a minute of your day, you can easily perform a potent ritual that can help enhance your life, connect you with Earth's magical energy, and point you in the direction of your goals. Quick and simple rituals are an amazing self-care practice, and a great way to check in with yourself and give yourself a spiritual moment of ~you~ time in the midst of your busy life. And thank goddess for one-minute rituals, because we're modern witches on the go \u2014 so sometimes a spare minute in the day is allllll we've got. We chatted with the experts at Energy Muse about their favorite [simple, one-minute crystal rituals](https://www.bustle.com/p/5-cleansing-rituals-for-mercury-retrograde-winter-2018-to-help-you-survive-in-one-piece-13202653) that anyone can perform quickly and easily to give themselves a mystical energy boost, and they gave us the low-down on exactly what crystals to use, how, and for what.
