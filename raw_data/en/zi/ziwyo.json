There was acid, asphaltum, rosin powder, Varsol paint thinner, acetone solvents, photo developers, oil based silk screen inks, varnishes, shellac etc.: all toxic, some carcinogenic. Printmakers often get sick before they realize a change is needed in what they are doing in their printmaking. Fortunately, printmakers like to solve problems and, they like to share. During the following years of my transition to less toxic practices, there were two main contributors to my learning curve: Keith Howard, who I met through workshopping at Praga Industries in Toronto, Grande Prairie Regional College Alberta, and later, through visits to R.I.T. New York, and Susan Rostow, who I met while printmaking in Santa Fe New Mexico. Keith was evangelistic in his commitment to spreading information about the dangers of working with acids, solvents and other pollutants that threaten our health through respiration and skin absorption and the global ecosystem through washout and waste. He travelled the printmaking world sharing new methods and materials as they came about. When Susan Rostow and William Jung started to develop a new non-toxic ink (Akua), Keith was on board immediately. Initially, I hated the stuff. It was too loose, didn't have any drag. I over wiped every plate for weeks. I couldn't get a good black intaglio line to save my life. Keith would not let me give up and for that, I have thanked him over and over, albeit now silently into the ether. Bless you Keith; and, thank you Susan. When walking into a non-toxic printmaking studio for the first time, a traditional printmaker might not notice any difference. NO WAIT! Of course they would: where's that 'intoxicating' smell that we were all addicted to? No smell of ink/oil residue, no solvent fumes, no acrid acid vapour. Learn to let that go! Visibly, there are few clues to any change from the traditional placement of presses, work stations, washout areas etc. You might notice, however, various recycle/reuse bins and trays around; for example, paper towels used to wipe Akua ink residue from glass surfaces, brayers and ink knives can be collected and reused for another wetter clean up at the end of a session, or the end of the week; fewer paper towels are needed if you have a collection of old face cloths that can be used as wipes, then rinsed and used over and over. Concerned about washing pigments down the drain? Do your first washout rinse into a bucket and discard into a designated ground collection area. If you are using photo polymers (solar plates) you can do your primary washout into a bucket or tray rather than the sink. Over time there is enough polymer residue collected at the bottom of the tray that, once the water evaporates, it can be removed and rolled into a small plastic ball for the garbage bin. The same practice can be used for any polymer based mediums/paints from brushes. We don't need any more plastic in our water! There are new etching mordents and tank solutions for metal plates, new stencil films and inks for silk screen, new and creative methods of making plates completely from recycled materials. I could go on with a list of stuff we use and changes we have made but all this info, and more, is available online from many studios around the world. I encourage you to check things out if you are interested (see link below). As I said, printmakers love to solve problems and share solutions. And, although I am an advocate for Akua Inks, I acknowledge that they are not everyone's cup of tea. Also it needs to be said that the label \"non-toxic\" is a bit of a misnomer except that it is our quest: perhaps we could more correctly call our current practices \"less-toxic\". If you can't give up your traditional oil based inks, you can at least give up using toxic solvent for cleanup with a switch to using a cheap vegetable oil. Or switch to the new \"safe wash\" (another misnomer) oil based inks which clean up with soap and water. Make sure you have good ventilation though, and don't wash the pigments down the drain....PLEASE! That's it for now from my side of the press! Anne Jones (Nanaimo, B.C.) What we do in the studio to be as eco-friendly as possible. - It begins with the ink Many of us use Akua soy-based inks as we like the combination of eco-friendly attributes: less toxic, no noxious smells and easy to clean up. We also are very satisfied with the results we can achieve in our printmaking. We are always on the search for the least toxic option in whatever we use. Photo: studio workstation with Akua inks - the 3 Rs Reduce, reuse, recycle: we live this way in studio and at home. We reuse material and papers when possible, recycle or upcycle other material and fabrics in clean up, compost what is eligible, limit waste whenever possible. We opt for local sources for materials when we can, supporting local vendors and communities, trying to be as eco-friendly as possible.

We focus our printmaking to those methods that best fit our creative interests and our effort to remain as eco-friendly as possible: monotypes, collagraphs, lino block printing and drypoint, at times in combination, at times with collage or chine colle technique.
