OPENING OF THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY OUVERTURE DE L'ASSEMBL\u00c9E DE LA SANT\u00c9 The PRESIDENT: Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as President of the Sixty-second World Health Assembly, I have the honour to open th e Sixty-third World Health Assembly. On behalf of the Health Assembly and the World Hea lth Organization, I have pleasure in welcoming our special guests: Mr Serguei Ordzhonikidze, Direc tor-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva, and representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations; Mr Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Unger, Counsellor of State, Head of the Department of Soci al Action and Health of the Republic and Canton of Geneva, and officials of the Republic, Canton, C ity and University of Geneva, and of the United Nations System of Organizations. I also welcome the representatives of the Executive Board. A63/VR/1 page 2 2. ADDRESS BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SECRETARY-G ENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS ALLOCUTION DU REPR\u00c9SENTANT DU G\u00c9N\u00c9RAL D E L'ORGANISATION DES NATIONS UNIES The PRESIDENT: I now give the floor to Mr Serguei Ordzhonikidze, Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva. Mr ORDZHONIKIDZE (Director-General of the United Of fice at Geneva, representing the Secretary- General of the United f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, Conseiller d'\u00c9tat , excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to wel come you to the Palais des Nations for the opening of the Sixty-third World Health Assembly. It is my pri vilege to convey to you the best wishes of the Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moon, for a productive Health Assembly, building on the important achievements in global public health over the past year. You come together five years before the deadline f or the realization of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Your focus on the hea lth-related Goals is indeed timely, and will provide a most valuable contribution to the high-le vel plenary meeting of the General Assembly, which will take place in September and which is aim ed at strengthening the collective efforts to enabl e us to meet the Goals within the deadline. Since the adoption of the Goals 10 years ago, the world has witnessed significant successes in combating extreme poverty and hunger, expanding sch ool enrolment, improving child health, increasing access to clean water and treatment of H IV/AIDS, and in controlling malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases. The health-related Goals are not only key objectives in their own right, they are multipliers that hold the potential to help accelerate progress across all the Goals. Nevertheless, progress has been uneven - across in dividual Goals and across regions - and if current trends continue, there is a real risk that several of the Goals will be missed. We have made strides in addressing child mortality, but we still fall short of the target of a two-thirds reduction compared with 1990. Maternal mortality figures have barely changed since the adoption of the Goals and are a stain on our collective consciousness. Af ter gains in the fight against HIV/AIDS at the beginning of this century, there are now worrying s igns of a lessening of the commitment to this devastating threat to development and security. Don ors currently give about US$ 10 000 million a year. Yet, it is estimated that controlling the epi demic would cost US$ 27 000 million annually. And for every two people starting on antiretroviral tre atment, there are five new infections. These figure s are simply not acceptable. While we may not have made as much progress as we would have wished for, we can still draw valuable lessons to guide our reinforced efforts. T his Health Assembly is a most welcome opportunity for the international community to review these les sons and work to operationalize them so that we may scale up the efforts to meet the health-related Millennium Development Goals. Inequalities continue to pose major barriers to pr eventive measures and access to health care and medicines. Fellow human beings in developing countr ies are at the greatest risk, are the hardest hit, have the least resilience and the fewest tools to a ddress health-related challenges. This is often compounded by a considerable exposure to natural di sasters and to the impact of climate change. The dramatic divergence in health status within and acr oss countries continues to grow. The diagnosis is clear: unless we place justice and equality at the heart of the public health agenda, we will simply n ot meet the Millennium Development Goals. The challenges in the different areas of health ar e diverse, but the key elements of treatments are similar. We need national ownership and effective g overnment leadership that strives to enhance the quantity, quality and focus on investments in the h ealth sector. This has to be financed through a combination of domestic resources and international development assistance. There is also a clear A63/VR/1 page 3 need to develop institutional capacity to deliver q uality health services equitably on a national scal e, with adequate facilities, competent staff, appropri ate supplies and effective monitoring. In our efforts to improve access and affordability of global public health, we need to maintain a strong focus on Millennium Goal 3 on achieving gend er equality. As we this year mark the tenth anniversary of the landmark Security Council Resolu tion 1325 and the fifteenth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, we mus t face the fact that redressing gender inequality remains difficult and, in some areas, elusive. Yet, it has implications across all Goals. We cannot ho pe to achieve any of them - not least in the area of p ublic health - if we do not step up efforts to empo wer women. They are drivers of progress and of lasting change. Our collective challenge is to radically increase the pace of change on the ground so that we can translate the promises of the Millennium Developmen t Goals into real progress for the world's poorest. We do have the knowledge, we do have the t echnology and we do have the resources, so we have a duty and a responsibility to employ them eff ectively in the service of vulnerable fellow human beings and for a better future for all. In that spi rit, I wish you a successful Sixty-third World Heal th Assembly. Thank you very much. 3.

ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE SIXTY-SECOND WOR LD HEALTH ASSEMBLY ALLOCUTION DU PR\u00c9SIDENT DE AS SEMBL\u00c9E MONDIALE DE LA SANT\u00c9 The PRESIDENT: 1 Vice-Presidents of the Health Assembly, Director-G eneral, Dr Margaret Chan. Fellow ministers of health, excellencies, distinguished delegates, W HO staff members, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a great honour and privilege for me to be the President of this august Health Assembly during the past year. It was certainly not merely a personal t ribute. More significantly, it was an honour accord ed to my country, Sri Lanka, and to my Region, South-E ast Asia, by the distinguished delegates to this Health Assembly. I have had the privilege of being very closely ass ociated with the work of WHO at the global and regional level for over 10 years. Having been a member of the Executive Board for two terms, I had the honour of chairing the Board in my second term - just prior to being elected the President a t the last Health Assembly. Hence WHO is an organizat ion that I deeply love and respect. Excellencies and distinguished delegates, during m y term of office, we witnessed a number of unprecedented challenges to global health. I recall that just before I assumed office, Dr Chan convene d a high-level consultation to discuss the implicatio n of the financial crisis that has struck the world like a gale force wind. I was requested by her to chair the session. I must commend the proactive role of WHO during th ese extremely difficult times on health systems and on poor and disadvantaged people. One r eason why the countries in South Asia have been protected against the full impact of the crisis is their traditionally cautious economic and financial policies. Associated with this of course is the pro minent role of government, including management of market forces. This approach has been subject to so me criticism in the past, and reforms in these area s have improved conditions for access to development assistance and international markets. We have learnt that in times of crisis it is impor tant not to forget the many other threats to health security. Preparing countries to cope with pandemic s, food insecurity, war and conflicts and the impact of adverse weather events requires effective surveillance systems. In this connection we need to applaud the work of the Director-General and WHO and the development partners. It is important to ensure that these systems do not fall victim to the economic turndown. Indeed, if the advent of the crisis provided the n ecessary stimulus to initiate reform, it was very opportune that a few years ago, we had commemorated 30 years after Alma-Ata, and adopted primary health-care reforms. These had the central objectiv e of moving towards universal coverage. In fact, we have witnessed with a great deal of interest the re cent health-care reforms of President Obama, who very courageously introduced some radical measures to make health care accessible and affordable to all Americans. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was another major challenge t hat we had to face in the past year. Unlike some of the earliest threats to global health, wher e most of the epidemics started in the developing countries, Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 started and first s pread in the developed world. It proved to us yet again diseases are no respecters of man-made bounda ries nor economic status, and that everyone is equally vulnerable. However, we must draw inspirati on from the fact that our collective global efforts enabled us to counter this pandemic quite successfu lly. We also commend WHO for efficiently coordinating the distribution of the pandemic influ enza vaccines to 95 countries; and the decision of the Director-General to continue to monitor the sit uation closely, particularly with respect to virus behaviour and to inform Member States accordingly. Health and disease profiles in the developing worl d are rapidly changing and the epidemic of noncommunicable diseases has already taken a footho ld in the developing world. The evidence is mounting regarding the global burden of noncommunic able diseases and their intimate connection with the increase in poverty and erosion of economi c growth. Some have referred to it as the \"silent 1 The following is the full text of the speech deliv ered by Mr Siripala de Silva in shortened form. A63/VR/1 page 6 tsunami\". Health systems in these countries are ove rburdened in trying to cope with the cost of treating noncommunicable diseases, while at the sam e time they are fighting communicable diseases and maternal and child health issues. In this situation, I believe that the high cost of taking care of complications from noncommunicable diseases could be avoided if such d iseases were addressed through a primary health care approach. We are thankful to WHO for defining a set of essential interventions to manage noncommunicable diseases through primary health car e and we are informed that these are good investments in health of populations in the long te rm. I am happy that WHO has selected my country, Sri Lanka, as one of the pilot countries to introdu ce this model. The time has come to include noncommunicable disea ses in the development domain, together with infectious diseases and health-systems strengt hening. These three issues are not in conflict. The y do not represent a set of \"either/or\" options. It i s the opposite. They can, and should, be mutually reinforcing. We need to place all three - communica ble diseases, noncommunicable diseases and health systems - on the development agenda. Failure to do so will derail international efforts to improve health and reduce poverty. The work of inte rnational development agencies in poverty alleviation and in the control of infectious diseas es is indeed essential for the world's \"bottom bill ion\", the people living in extreme poverty. These agencie s also have a key role in promoting balanced investment for healthy development and noncommunica ble diseases must be a part of such investment. The developed world, unless it responds to the epid emic of such diseases today, risks failing a considerable proportion of its intended beneficiari es. The Commission on Social Determinants of Health es tablished clearly that the economic and social features of society are closely linked to th e distribution of health within and between countri es. The social determinants of health are the circumsta nces of daily life: the way in which people are bor n, grow, live, work, and grow old. They also include t he structural drivers of those conditions, such as the distribution of power, money and resources. Sri Lanka has been proud to be strongly associated with the work of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health, led by Sir Michael Marmot. Sri Lanka was a country partner and a sponsor of the Health Assembly resolution on reducing health i nequities through action on the social determinants of health. We hosted the first Regiona l Consultation on Social Determinants of Health during the course of last year. We are fully aware that the successes in health that Sri Lanka has achieved have been possible because for 50 years we gave pride of place to a multisectoral approach to health development, where education, nutrition a nd social welfare policies complemented the health policies in a judicious manner. The challenge now is to maintain the momentum of t he Commission and implement the main recommendations in the resolution, building concret e action in Member States to reduce health inequities. Member States need to examine their own contexts and see what will work best for them. This means building capacity to measure and monitor health inequities, making health services and programmes more equitable, and seeing how governmen ts can implement an approach that considers health equity in all policies. It is my fervent hop e that WHO will continue to provide strong support and leadership to achieve this. Sri Lanka is working with WHO to improve the capac ity of our public-health programmes to work together to reduce health inequities. Addressi ng the social determinants will be vital to our efforts to address this. We also see opportunities in increasing intersectoral action at the local lev el. We hope to share this experience with other countri es, and I also hope that other Member States will take up the challenge of the Commission so that the re can be a global exchange of experiences of reducing health inequities. Climate change has become a significant and emergi ng threat to public health, and it changes the way we must look at protecting vulnerable popul ations. The impact of climate on human health will not be evenly distributed around the world. De veloping country populations, particularly in Small island States, arid and high mountain zones, and in densely populated coastal areas, are considered to be particularly vulnerable. Our own Region, South-East Asia, is particularly vulnerable. In my Region, the main adverse health outcomes tha t are predicted are varied: mountain countries like Bhutan and Nepal could face disaster s of flash floods resulting from glacier melting an d A63/VR/1 page 7 the spread of vector-borne diseases at high altitud e. Maldives will face a very fundamental problem of existence as a result of global warming. No country will be spared one way or another. We are pleased that WHO has helped most South-East Asia Region countries to set up national bodies to study their national vulnerability and as sess the potential impacts from climate change. We need much more support and technical advice. Areas with weak health infrastructure - mostly in developing countries - will be the least able to co pe without assistance to prepare and respond. Another important response needed to minimize the h ealth impacts of climate change is to build community capacity to help people to adapt to clima te change, as a social response to extreme weather conditions and disasters. We have discussed the issue of migration of health workers at different fora, the Regional Committee, the Executive Board and even at the Heal th Assembly. We have stressed that effective and efficient management of the existing health workfor ce would lead to effective programme delivery and significant improvements in health services. We have noted with concern the continued international migration of health personnel, which has contributed to unacceptable shortages, and geographical and skill-mix imbalances in health wor kforce in many countries of the Region. Most of our developing countries are not yet technically eq uipped to assess adequately the magnitude and characteristics of the outflow of their health pers onnel, nor are they able to increase the salaries a nd allowances to match those of the receiving countrie s. I am pleased to see that an international code of practice has been formulated to address these issues and wish that this be adopted and implemente d diligently and seriously. However my own contention is that the code does not go far enough. Considering the magnitude of the problem I feel that we should make the code more binding on both t he countries of origin and the recipient countries if it is to be truly effective. We would also seek WHO support for our efforts by facilitating dialogue and raising awareness at the highest national and international levels an d between different stakeholders about this importa nt issue. In many countries we have had medical systems that have proved effective and reliable for over thousands of years. I believe it is high time we pl ace more emphasis and draw from these Eastern effective methods to deliver health care to million s at lower cost. Ayurveda, homeopathy and other alternative and traditional systems of medicine, wh ile reducing costs of care, can increase coverage t o the entire population. Recently I was interested to read an interesting discussion in American medical journals proposing to include \"complementary and al ternative medicine systems\" in medical school teaching. The quantity and quality of research in c omplementary and integrative health care is still a frontier science but is growing rapidly and WHO sho uld take a leadership role to help countries make evidence-based decisions regarding these practices. Health of migrants, most of whom are in foreign co untries for economic reasons, has been another important matter of concern for the disting uished delegates of this global Health Assembly. If we subscribe to the principle that health is a basi c human right, leaving aside humanitarian considerations, this is a very unsatisfactory situa tion that needs to be redressed urgently. We need t o ensure that the appropriate provision of adequate q uality health care is an essential requirement for recruitment of labour to these countries. Better health is central to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, both as an end in itself and as a major contributor to the ove rall goal of reducing poverty. Reporting on progres s towards the Goals has underscored the importance of working with countries to generate more reliable and timely data and to improve health information s ystems. In the poorest countries, however, achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals represents one of the greatest challenges in international development. Currently available d ata show that while some countries have made impressive gains in achieving health-related target s, others are falling behind. We are also aware tha t often the countries making the least progress are t hose affected by high levels of HIV/AIDS, economic hardship or conflict. To this we have to add the st eep declines required in child and maternal mortali ty, where progress lags far behind aspirations. It is increasingly evident that improving health o utcomes to reach the Millennium Development Goals will not be possible without major improvemen ts in health-care delivery systems. Progress will also depend of increasing the availability of resou rces and the effectiveness and equity of spending A63/VR/1 page 8 these resources. Escalating health-care costs, a gr owing number of pharmaceutical treatments, and increasing resistance to antibiotics are just three of the factors that make therapeutically sound and cost-effective use of medicines by health workers a nd consumers more and more necessary. Therefore rational use of medicines is an urgent need today. Irrational use of medicines by prescribers and consumers is a very complex problem, depending on a number of various and interrelated factors which influence the use of medicines. A well-respec ted Sri Lankan, Professor Senaka Bibile, promulgated the concept of essential drugs 50 years ago. Due to the subsequent work of WHO, this triggered interest worldwide in the adoption of ess ential medicines policies. We need to revisit these policies and once again actively promote the ration al use of medicines. For this, the cooperation of t he medical community is essential. It calls for the im plementation of several different interventions at the same time and should also cover the use of traditio nal and herbal medicines. A media person in Geneva asked me soon after I too k over the Presidency last year, how we might measure our success. I mentioned then that, u nlike a company that always determines its success by its profits, WHO and the health sector c ould not use a similar yardstick in assessing our success or failure. To do so would unacceptably neg ate the principles of equity and social justice tha t we cherish so much. Our success can only be measure d by the manner in which we support and guide all Member States to provide quality, affordable an d socially-acceptable health care to all of their people irrespective of all other considerations. It is up to the Member countries to build their own health systems through innovative approaches, takin g into consideration their ground realities. It is the duty of the developed world to support developing a nd least-developed countries to achieve the goal of equity in health. Thank you for your attention. Before dealing with the first two items on our pro visional agenda, I would like to briefly suspend the plenary and ask our delegates to kindly remain seated while the Director-General and I bid farewell to our special guests. 5.

In accordance with Rule 24 of the Rules of Procedure, at each regular session, th e Health Assembly shall elect a President and five Vice-Presidents, who shall hold office until their successors are elected. You have before you a white paper which contains names of delegates proposed fo r consideration following consultations within their respective regions, as well as their respecti ve countries. To consider the nomination for the of fice of the President of the Sixty-third World Health As sembly, I recall that, in accordance with the practice of regional rotation which the Health Asse mbly has followed for many years in this regard, A63/VR/1 page 9 the President of the Sixty-third World Health Assem bly should be chosen from among delegates of Members of the Eastern Mediterranean Region. I unde rstand that Mr Mondher Zenaidi of Tunisia is proposed for the office of President of the Sixty-t hird World Health Assembly. Is this proposal acceptable? In the absence of any observations, and as it appe ars that there are no other proposals, I suggest, in accordance with Rule 78 of the Rules of Procedur e, that the Health Assembly approves the nomination and elects its President by acclamation. (Applause/Applaudissements) Mr Mondher Zenaidi is thereby elected President of the Sixty-third World Health Assembly and I invite him to take his seat on the rostrum. Mr Mondher Zenaidi (Tunisia) took the presidential chair.

A63/VR/2 page 12 SECOND PLENARY MEETING Monday, 17 May 2010, at 11:50 President: Mr Mondher ZENAIDI OF THE AGENDA AND ALLOCATION OF ITEMS T O THE MAIN COMMITTEES ADOPTION DE L'ORDRE DU JOUR ET R\u00c9PARTITION DES POI NTS ENTRE LES COMMISSIONS PRINCIPALES The PRESIDENT: The next item to be considered is item 1.4, Adopti on of the agenda and allocation of items to the main committees, which was examined by the General Committee at its first meeting. The General Committee examined the provisional agenda for the S ixty-third World Health Assembly (document A63/1), as prepared by the Executive Board and sent to all Member States. The General Committee recommended to delete the following four items from the provisional agenda as there are no corresponding items of business to deal with under them: item 5, Admission of new Members and Associate Members, as no new applications have been received; item 15.3, Special arrangements for settlement of arrears; item 15.5, Assessment of new Members and Associate Members; and item 17.5, A63/VR/2 page 15 Report of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Bo ard. Am I correct in assuming it is agreed to delete these items? I see no objections; it is so decided. May I there fore assume that the Health Assembly agrees to adopt the provisional agenda as contained in docume nt A63/1, as amended? It is so decided. Document A63/1 Rev.1, reflecting the changes in th e agenda will be distributed tomorrow morning. The General Committee also decided to reco mmend to the plenary that the Sixty-third World Health Assembly should close on Friday, 21 May. Doe s the plenary agree to this proposal? I see no objection, it is so decided. The provisional agenda of the Health Assembly was p repared by the Executive Board in such a way as to indicate a proposed allocation of items t o Committees A and B, on the basis of the terms of reference of the main committees. The General Commi ttee has decided to recommend to the plenary that agenda item 13 concerning health conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem and in the occupied Syrian Golan - which is normally allocated to Committee B - be allocated this year to Committee A and be taken up by Committee A during the afternoon of Tuesday, 18 May. This recommendation is based on the General Committee's view that the change in timing will facilitate a more effective debate involving a ll interested parties. This recommendation is premised on the following understanding: that this change is without precedent to the future allocatio n and scheduling of this item; that the proposed draf t resolution for this matter will be available in a ll languages, fully respecting the principle of multil ingualism, as soon as possible in advance of Tuesda y afternoon; that Committee A will take into account both the need for coordination among and between regional and other groups, and for ensuring adequat e time for debate of the other items allocated to i t. With these understandings in mind does the Health A ssembly agree with the recommendation of the General Committee? As I see no objection, it is so decided. It is understood that, later in the session, it ma y become necessary to transfer items from one committee to the other, depending on each main comm ittee's workload. The General Committee will meet again on Wednesday, 19 May, to review progress on dealing with the agenda and to make any adjustments to allocation of items to Committees, o r to the timetable that are necessary. Does the Health Assembly agree with these proposals? As I se e no objection, it is so decided. Returning now to the meetings of the plenary, in o rder to facilitate the organization of the week, I should like to propose, and this is a procedure f ollowed on previous occasions, that the order of th e list of speakers for the discussion under agenda it em 3 should be strictly adhered to, and that furthe r inscriptions should be taken in the order in which they are made. These inscriptions should be handed in to the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of the Health Assembly, or during the plenary to th e officer responsible for the list of speakers, on th e rostrum. I propose that the speakers list should be closed tomorrow, Tuesday, at 10:00 hours. I assume these proposals are acceptable to everyone. 3. REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD ON ITS 125TH AND 1 26TH SESSIONS RAPPORT DU CONSEIL EX\u00c9CUTIF SUR SES CENT VINGT-CIN QUI\u00c8ME ET CENT VINGT-SIXI\u00c8ME SESSIONS The PRESIDENT: We shall now move on to item 2, Report of the Exec utive Board on its 125th and 126th sessions. The Executive Board has an important role to play in the affairs of the Health Assembly. This is quite in keeping with WHO's Constitution, a ccording to which the Board has to give effect to the decisions and policies of the Health Assembly, to act as its executive organ and to advise the Health Assembly on questions referred to it. The Bo ard is also called upon to submit proposals on its own initiative. The Board, therefore, appoints four members to represent it at the Health Assembly. The role of the Executive Board representatives is to convey to the Health Assembly, on behalf of the Board, the rationale and nature of recommendations made by the Board for the Health Assembly's consideration. Statements by the Executive Board re presentatives, speaking as members of the Board A63/VR/2 page 16 appointed to present its views, are therefore to be distinguished from statements of delegates expressing the views of their governments. I now have pleasure in giving the floor to the rep resentative of the Executive Board, Dr Sam Zaramba, Chairman of the Board. Dr ZARAMBA (Chairman of the Executive Board): Mr President, Vice-Presidents, Dr Margaret Chan, D irector-General of the World Health Organization, honourable ministers, excellencies, d istinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon to you all. First of all, I would like to congratulate you, Mr President, and the other offi ce- bearers on your election, and wish you every succes s in chairing this session of the Health Assembly, which has a very full and interesting agenda. As a detailed report of the work of the Executive Board is available in document A63/2, I will focus my statem ent on summarizing the highlights of the 125th sess ion of the Executive Board, held in May 2009 and on the 126th session, in January 2010. During the 125th session of the Executive Board in May 2009, the Board confirmed that elimination of measles was feasible and the Secreta riat undertook to report on assessing the feasibili ty of elimination to the Health Assembly in 2010. The Board also noted the report on availability, safety and quality of blood products, and considered a dra ft resolution submitted by a number of Member States but agreed to postpone further discussion to the 126th session. The Board similarly decided to defer further discussion on the proposed revision o f the guidelines on the WHO review of psychoactive substances for international control t o the 126th session in order to allow for technical input. After discussion of the report on birth defe cts and of a draft resolution submitted by several Member States, it was agreed that the Secretariat w ould revise the report which, with the proposed draft resolution, would be reconsidered at the 126t h session in January 2010. The Board established an Independent Expert Oversight Advisory Committee and approved its terms of reference. The 126th session of the Board in January 2010 agr eed to include three supplementary items: the health consequences of the earthquake in Haiti, treatment and prevention of pneumonia, and leprosy. Following an update on the current situation on th e pandemic (H1N1) 2009, members agreed that the pandemic had demonstrated the effectivenes s of the International Health Regulations (2005) for the first time. There were lessons to be learnt , for instance in the area of communications and zoonoses, and the need to strengthen core capacitie s in surveillance and response had been identified. The Board agreed that the Director-General should a ctivate the IHR Review Committee to examine the global response to the pandemic, which would su bmit an interim report to the Sixty-third World Health Assembly. The Board discussed the global strategy and plan o f action on public health, innovation and intellectual property, and agreed that the full rep ort of the Expert Working Group on Research and Development Financing in all the official languages of WHO would be circulated in time for an informal meeting with Member States on 13 May 2010. The Board agreed that an open-ended working group of Member States should be convened to reach agreement on the final elements under the pan demic influenza preparedness framework for sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and oth er benefits. The group met on 10-12 May 2010 and its report has been submitted to the Sixty-third Wo rld Health Assembly. In order to give impetus to the process of monitor ing annual progress towards achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals, a mult i-sponsored resolution has been recommended to the Health Assembly for adoption. The Board agreed that the draft code of practice f or international recruitment of health personnel, which reflected the outcomes of regional discussions, would be submitted to the Health Assembly for consideration, with any comments or am endments submitted by Member States forwarded separately. Following its discussion of the report on infant a nd young child nutrition, the Board has recommended to the Health Assembly a resolution whi ch, among other things, requests the Director- General to develop a comprehensive implementation p lan on infant and young child nutrition. The A63/VR/2 page 17 Board discussed the items on birth defects and avai lability, safety and quality of blood products, and adopted the draft resolutions deferred from the 125 th session. On food safety, the Board recommended a resolution to the Health Assembly on advancing food safety initiatives, which focused on greater intern ational engagement. Several Board members called for more resources to be allocated to the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. It was emphasized that all stakeholders had a role to play, including Member States. The Board also discussed reports on tuberculosis control, leishmaniasis control, smallpox eradication: destruction of variola virus stocks, and the global eradication of measles. The Board recognized the growing public health burden d ue to viral hepatitis and proposed a resolution to the Health Assembly which, among various actions to improve prevention, control, diagnosis and treatment, designates a World Hepatitis Day. Consultations over the past year, together with in formal discussions during the 126th session, on strategies to reduce the harmful use of alcohol res ulted in the Board's adoption of resolution EB126.R11, to which a revised draft global strategy was annexed. The Board recommended the Health Assembly to endorse that global strategy. The item on Strategic Approach to International Ch emical Management had been deferred from the Sixty-second World Health Assembly and the Boar d adopted two resolutions submitted by several Member States. The two texts focused on different w ays to improve health: through safe and environmentally sound waste management, and through sound management of obsolete pesticides and other obsolete chemicals. Considering anew the proposed revision of the guid elines on the WHO review of psychoactive substances for international control, the Board mad e a few modifications to the texts and approved the revised guidelines. In its consideration of the treatment and preventi on of pneumonia, the Board recommended a resolution for adoption by the Health Assembly on a ccelerating progress towards achievement of Millennium Development Goal 4 to reduce child morta lity through the prevention and treatment of pneumonia. In addition to the discussion of technical and hea lth matters, the Board noted the report on the Eleventh General Programme of Work, 2006-2015, whic h was considered as remaining relevant to the work of the Organization. The Board also reappointe d Dr Luis Gomes Sambo as Regional Director for Africa and appointed Ms Zsuzsanna Jakab as Regional Director for Europe. The Board recommended adoption of the scale of assessments by the Health Assembly, and took note of the request by the Programme, Budget and Administration Committee in i ts discussion of safety and security of staff and premises and the Capital Master Plan for further el aboration of the financing options for capital expenditure and recurrent costs, to be submitted to the Sixty-third World Health Assembly. The Board appointed the candidates proposed by the Director-G eneral as members of the Independent Expert Advisory Oversight Committee, established by the Bo ard at its 125th session. Mr President, the other Executive Board Representa tives and I would like to assure you that we will be available during the discussions in the Com mittees of the Health Assembly. We stand ready to lend our full support and to provide additional inf ormation as required on how the Board dealt with certain items under consideration and in doing so t o facilitate the work of the Health Assembly. The PRESIDENT: Thank you, Dr Zaramba, for your excellent report. I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the work of the Executive Board, and in particular to express our appreciation and our warm thanks to the outgoing members who have co ntributed very actively to the work of the Board. This concludes our review of item 2 of our a genda. The meeting rose at 12:25. La s\u00e9ance est lev\u00e9e \u00e0 12h25. A63/VR/3 page 18 THIRD PLENARY MEETING Monday, 17 May 2010, at 14:40 President: Mr Mondher ZENAIDI (Tunisia) later: ADDRESS honourable ministers, excellencies, distinguished delegates, Dr Mahler, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Public health must never cease to learn from its s uccesses, and its failures. Thirty years ago, the World Health Assembly declared that \"the world and all its people have won freedom from smallpox\". That official death certificate for an ancient scou rge marked an unprecedented achievement in the history of public health. It provided dramatic proo f of the power of collective action to improve the human condition in a permanent way. This is worth r emembering at a time when the international community is engaged in the most ambitious attack o n human misery in history, with just five years left until 2015. Smallpox eradication was a single-disease initiati ve. That killing, blinding, disfiguring disease never had a cure. The cornerstone of that campaign was prevention at a time when most health systems around the world were designed to deliver c urative care. An initiative that broke every single chain of virus transmission in every corner of the world was the ultimate example of universal coverage. This tells us what collective action for a common cause can achieve. Among its many legacies, the eradication campaign spawned the Expa nded Programme on Immunization at a time when less than 20% of children in the developing wo rld were covered by immunization programmes. A63/VR/3 page 19 Throughout the 1980s, the so-called \"lost decade f or development\", the expansion of childhood immunization was a robust and inspiring success sto ry in the midst of an oil crisis, a recession, a crushing debt crisis, and structural adjustment pro grammes that slashed national spending for social services, including health. Doesn't that sound fami liar? This reminds us of how greatly health can suffer from policies made in other sectors. The point I want to make is this. As we enter the second decade of the 21st century, and the home stretch for reaching the Millennium Developmen t Goals, we need to draw on every lesson, every approach, instrument, and innovative way of raising funds or collaborating together, from Heads of State to civil society. We have very little time le ft, with little space for unproductive debates. We need to move forward very fast. We need horizontal and w e need vertical approaches. We need to scale up the delivery of commodities, and we need to strengt hen the fundamental capacities that allow us to do so. We need coherence in policies, within and beyon d the health sector, and we need complementarity of efforts. Reaching the health-related Goals is not about nat ional averages. It is about reaching the poor, who are almost invariably the hardest to reach. Thi s is the challenge, and the measure of success. The Millennium Development Goals promote health as part of an overarching strategy for poverty reduction. Let me put it bluntly: if we miss the po or, we miss the point. We have a long way to go, especially for maternal and newborn mortality, and we welcome the efforts being made, on multiple fronts, to accelerate progress in this area. But le t us take heart from what has been achieved so far. Success in public health nearly always saves lives. But it also has symbolic value. Recent progress tells us that when the international community is f ully committed to a goal, creative solutions can be found and obstacles, including financial ones, can be overcome. Since the start of this century, the number of und er-five childhood deaths dropped below the 10 million mark for the first time in nearly six de cades, and then dropped again to below 9 million. The number of people in low- and middle-income coun tries receiving antiretroviral therapy for AIDS moved from under 200 000 in late 2002, to 3 million , then beyond 4 million, an achievement unthinkable a decade ago. The rate of people newly ill with tuberculosis peaked and then began a slow but steady decline. For the first time in decades, we are seeing signs that the steadily deteriorating malaria situation might be turned around. Progress in controlling the neglected tropical diseases continued to make impressive progress. By the end o f 2008, some 670 million people had been reached with preventive chemotherapy for at least o ne of these diseases. Cases of guinea-worm disease are at their lowest level ever, now confine d to only four countries. I think we can conclude: increased investment for health development is work ing. Like the smallpox eradication campaign, the drive to reach the Millennium Development Goals has left some legacies that benefit public health a cross the board. Let me mention a few. First, the Millennium Declaration and its Goals turned our thi nking about development upside down. What do I mean by that? For a long time, factors such as acce ss to safe water and sanitation, literacy rates, in fant and young child mortality, and maternal mortality w ere considered as indicators of a country's level o f socioeconomic development. According to the logic a t that time, living conditions and health status would gradually improve as economies developed and prosperity increased. That happened, of course, but frequently not to the benefit of society's poor est and most marginalized people. Also, too often, economic growth has meant wealth creation for some, and increased poverty for others. The Millennium Development Goals turned this thinking a round. Instead of waiting for living conditions and health status to gradually improve, the Goals c alled for a direct attack on the conditions and diseases that anchor people in poverty. This was pu t forward as the best, and probably the fastest, route to equitable and more balanced progress. Indi cators of development became engines for development. A quest for economic development becam e a quest for social development. The report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health has taken this thinking a few more steps forwards. Secondly, the Millennium Development Goals changed thinking about aid effectiveness, as reflected in the Paris Declaration and the Accra Ag enda for Action. An almost fashionable scepticism about the value of aid, with blame placed on weak c apacities and governance in recipient countries, was replaced by recognition that the policies and b ehaviours of donors could also be at fault. Accountability for results must be mutual. Good aid honours the priorities, capacities and A63/VR/3 page 20 responsibilities of recipient countries to their ci tizens. Good aid aims to eliminate the very need fo r aid. It does so by investing in the capacities and the infrastructures needed to move forward towards self-reliance. If aid does not explicitly aim for s elf-reliance, the need for aid will never end. For obvious reasons, breaking the cycle of dependence o n aid contributes to equity among nations in a fundamental way. Thirdly, the drive to reach the health-related Goa ls unleashed the best of human creativity, bringing a host of innovations for improving health , especially among the poorest. The list is long: t he GAVI Alliance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuber culosis and Malaria, UNITAID, new partnerships to develop medicines and vaccines for diseases of the poor, advance market commitments as an incentive for industry, a finance facility fo r immunization, a facility to reduce the costs of malaria drugs, and the International Health Partner ship as a new way of working within countries. We have all contributed in some way to these innovatio ns for international health cooperation. The trend continues. Earlier this year, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation launched the Decade of Vaccines by pledging US$ 10 000 million o ver the next 10 years to help deliver existing vaccines and develop new ones. This commitment is m ost welcome. Vaccines are one of the best life- saving buys on offer, preventing an estimated 2 to 3 million deaths each year. WHO and UNICEF, in close collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates F oundation, countries, and partners, are initiating a process to define the ambitions and scope of this D ecade of Vaccines. The momentum that has been growing since the start of this century must contin ue. Last month, WHO launched simultaneous immunization weeks in more than 100 countries. Thes e events are building public and professional awareness of the value of immunization as well as s aving lives. You will be aware of the setbacks that occur when people decide that vaccines are risky, unnecessary, or even part of a conspiracy. This has been a problem for measles, for the uptake of pandemic vaccines, and most especially for poliomye litis. Vaccines touch your agenda at several points. You will be considering accelerated action to reduce deaths from pneumonia, the feasibility of measles eradication, and the prevention of hepatiti s B virus infection through immunization of infants . As requested by the Sixty-first World Health Assem bly, you will also be considering an aggressive new strategic plan to complete poliomyel itis eradication. The plan incorporates several new strategies that respond to different transmission d ynamics in different settings, make use of a new bivalent vaccine, and address head-on the problem o f international spread that has made progress so fragile. Significantly, the plan maps out a more sy stematic engagement of the initiative in the broade r effort to strengthen immunization systems. This is a most welcome emphasis. The Polio Initiative knows how to deliver interventions to hard-to-reach populations. This know-how becomes broadly beneficial in the homestretch to 2015, where the gr eatest challenge lies in reaching underserved populations. Last month's poliomyelitis outbreak in Tajikistan, in a region certified as poliomyelitis - free since 2002, is a stark reminder that finishing eradication is the only viable option for respondi ng to this disease. A resurgence of poliomyelitis, of deaths, and childhood paralysis is the predictable consequence if we fail to stay the course. Collecti vely, countries and partners have a moral duty to finish the job. Good news for public health usually arises from factors like political commitment, sufficient resources, strong interventions and impl ementation capacity, equitable delivery, and alignment with national priorities and capacities. Sometimes, though, we are just plain lucky. This ha s been the case with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009. The vi rus did not mutate to a more lethal form. Cases of resistance to oseltamivir remained few and isola ted. The vaccine closely matched circulating viruses and showed an excellent safety record. Emer gency wards and intensive care units were often strained, but few health systems were overwhelmed a nd the effects were usually short-lived. Schools closed, but borders remained open, and disruptions to travel and trade were far less severe than feare d. Had things gone wrong in any of these areas, we wou ld have a very different agenda before us today. This has been the most closely watched and carefull y scrutinized pandemic in history. It is normal tha t every decision and action, especially on the part o f WHO, will likewise be closely scrutinized and critically assessed. We welcome this approach. The pandemic has also been the first major test of the functioning of the revised International Health Reg ulations, which entered into force in 2007. During the January session of the Executive Board, I propo sed that a previously scheduled review of the functioning of the Regulations could also be used t o assess the international response to the influenz a pandemic. The Board agreed to this proposal. A repo rt of the Review Committee's first meeting is A63/VR/3 page 21 before you. When I opened that meeting, I stressed the need for a frank and critical assessment of performance, including WHO's performance, in a proc ess that is independent, credible, and transparent. We want to know what worked well. We w ant to know what went wrong and, ideally, why. We want to know what can be done better and, i deally, how. We are seeking lessons, about how the International Health Regulations (2005) have fu nctioned, about how WHO and the international community responded to the pandemic, that can help the management of future public health emergencies of international concern. And I can ass ure you: there will be more. The report of the Review Committee's first meeting summarizes issues and questions repeatedly raised and likely to guide the review. The Committee further agreed to l ook into criticisms that have been levelled at WHO for its management of the pandemic. As I said, we welcome this review. We have some solid evidence that aid for health de velopment is working. But it needs to work much better. The drive to reach the health-related Millennium Development Goals has taught us a major lesson, and this is a lesson about failure. F or decades, we have collectively failed to invest adequately in basic health systems, infrastructures , training of staff, information systems, regulator y capacity, and systems for social protection. This i s an absolute barrier, and trying to bypass it by building separate single-purpose systems is not the answer. International donors, partners, and governments themselves have failed to rally around national health policies, strategies, and prioritie s. This contributes to fragmentation, duplication, and added demands and costs, and defeats national ownership. We have learnt this. How can we scale up interventions or aim for universal coverage when the health systems in so many countries are on the verge of collapse? Or when the world faces a shortage of four million doctors, nurses and other health personnel? Weak health systems blunt the power of global health initiatives to reach their g oals. Weak health systems are wasteful. They waste money and dilute the return on investments. They wa ste money when regulatory systems fail to control the price and quality of medicines or the c osts of care in the private sector. They waste trai ning when workers are lured away by better working condi tions or better pay. They waste efficiency when needless procedures are performed, or when essentia l procedures are precluded by interruptions in the supply chain. They waste opportunities for poverty reduction when poor people are driven even deeper into poverty by the costs of care or the failure of preventive services. Above all, weak health system s waste lives. This problem is now recognized by coun tries and donors alike, and it is being addressed by a range of new and existing initiatives, includi ng several global health initiatives. Though design ed to deliver specific health outcomes, these initiati ves now recognize that meeting their goals and thei r objectives and their targets depends on a well-func tioning health system. In my view, this shift of attention is nothing short of revolutionary. Equity and social justice are at the heart of the Millenn ium Development Goals. They were always at the heart of the primary health care approach. As last year's resolution on primary health care noted, principles such as universal access to services, multisectora l action, and community participation form a solid ba sis for strengthening health systems. Efforts to reduce maternal and newborn deaths have shown the s lowest progress of all the Millennium Development Goals in all regions. This should come as no surprise, as reducing these deaths depends absolutely on a well-functioning health system. In preparation for the September United Nations su mmit on the Millennium Development Goals, the Secretary-General's office is finalizing a Joint Action Plan to accelerate progress in reaching the health-related Goals, with a special f ocus on maternal and child health. I encourage you to participate in the technical briefings on the Go als on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoon, as your views will be decisive in shaping the devel opment of this Joint Action Plan. Health systems are an issue for other items on you r agenda. Drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis arise because of shortcomings in general health ser vices, including years of neglect of laboratory services, inadequate regulatory capacity to ensure the supply and quality of medicines, and a dire shortage of health personnel. In the so-called viru s importation belt in sub-Saharan Africa, the sprea d of poliomyelitis has become predictable, because th e virus travels by exploiting weaknesses in health systems. Strong regulatory capacity underpins effor ts to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, to control tobacco, to protect children from harmful marketing practices, and to assure the safety and quality of medical and blood products. Some 85 countries, repr esenting 65% of the world's population, do not have reliable cause-of-death statistics. This means that causes of death are neither known nor recorde d, and health programmes are left to base their strate gies on very crude and sometimes imprecise A63/VR/3 page 22 estimates. However, on the positive side, work to i mprove facility-based health care, which is critica l for reducing maternal and newborn deaths, will incr ease the capacity to respond to the vast new challenges that come with the rise of chronic nonco mmunicable diseases. These are some of the issues you will be discussing this week. Improving fundame ntal capacities helps reach international commitments, increases efficiency as well as fairne ss, improves health outcomes in sustainable ways, and moves countries towards greater self-reliance. We have failed to do this job properly in the past. As we enter the home stretch to 2015, we must get b ack on the right track. On that, I thank you. 2. ANNOUNCEMENTS COMMUNICATIONS Vice-Presidents, Chairmen of the mai n committees, Director-General, honourable ministers and heads of delegation, distinguished gu ests, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa allow me first of all to congratulate you, Mr President, on your presidency of this Sixty-third World Health Assembl y. We believe that the wisdom and counsel you bring to this august house will lead us to reach fr uitful deliberations. Madam Director-General, on behalf of the Ministers of Health of the African Region, I wish to congratulate you on your brilliant and invigorating speech. As usual, you have done us proud and you have brought issues of equity and justice to the ce ntre of health in the world. The African Region would also like to thank you for the commitment and determination that you have exhibited leading WHO, and especially your unwavering support to the African Region. This is exemplified, inter alia, by your personal attendance at several key meetings in our Region, including the Fifty-ninth Regional Committee in Kigali in August 2009, and the WHO Glo bal Policy Group in Johannesburg in April 2010. We thank you for your tireless support and energy i n fighting and combating epidemics and pandemics that afflict our Region, including, in pa rticular, the recent global outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. We salute your leadership and that of your team in this and in other areas. The theme for this session aims at achieving the h ealth-related Millennium Development Goals. The African Region would invite you not to lose sig ht of the fact that poverty exacerbates the consequences of devastating epidemics, and that rap id progress to achieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals in Africa is mainly ha mpered by weak health systems, as the Director-General has said, particularly at the oper ational level. This debate comes at an opportune time, because th e report of the Fifty-ninth session of the Regional Committee for Africa noted that most count ries in our Region have not made sufficient progress. Only a few countries are on track for Goa l 4, while the Region has made very little progress towards achieving Goal 5. At the midway in the coun tdown to 2015, the target here for achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, severa l examples of success in Africa can however be cited. Although we do have these, huge dispariti es still exist within and between countries. The Commission on the Social Determinants of Health has reminded us of this fact. Therefore, greater efforts are needed at national and international levels for many countries in the African region to meet the Millennium Developme nt Goal targets. The estimated number of women dying during pregnancy and childbirth remains unacceptably high in our Region, and progress A63/VR/3 page 24 towards Goal 5 lags behind all other Millennium Dev elopment Goal targets. Only 13 countries have maternal mortality ratios below 550 deaths per 100 000 live births in the Region. Behind the figures, however, behind the projection s, we must constantly remember that there are individuals such as women who lose their lives resulting in destroyed families, and that for the poorest of the poor, the death of a mother during c hildbirth pushes the family into destitution and affects an entire generation. This clearly is unacc eptable. We must therefore make every mother and child count, and to be able to do this, we must be able to count every mother and child. And this is why our Region has launched the Commission on Women 's Health in the African Region, which was established in Monrovia, Liberia during April 2010. Strengthening Africa's health systems is critical. Investment in human resources for health can not be considered a recurrent cost. It must be trea ted as a capital investment if we are to make progr ess towards Millennium Development Goal 5 because it en ables us to make priority interventions that the Region needs to improve maternal and newborn health . Mr President, we are happy to report progress on Goal 6 in the sub-Saharan region; estimated cove rage of antiretroviral therapy is at 44%, an appreciable increase from a few years ago but still far below the universal coverage target of 80%. We have seen success in combating malaria. Countries h ave shown that it is possible, with investment, to reduce the burden of malaria to over 50%. Eight Afr ican countries have documented reductions of more than 50% during the last decade. However, we s till see challenges in reducing and reversing the incidence of tuberculosis, and we are seeing the em ergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis and only nine countries are on track for Goal 7C: access to safe drinking-water. At a time of global financial difficulty, therefor e, the gains we have seen on the African continent risk being reversed, and we would say tha t this is the time to ring-fence and indeed scale u p spending on health. We know that bailing out failin g banks may bring temporary relief. Africa has demonstrated that increasing spending on health, as well as rigorous and prudent management of available resources, brings about dramatic and long -lasting success and saves lives. The work of WHO, the Global Fund, the GAVI Alliance and other i nternational health actors bears ample witness to this. This therefore is a time for innovation. It is a t ime to demonstrate that global health is a public good and not a market commodity; that it is a funda mental human right that should not be dependent on the movements of the stock exchange. We know wha t the challenges are and we know that we need to achieve a budget target of at least US$ 34 per c apita on health spending, as recommended by the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, for a basi c package of essential health interventions, and we on the continent are ready and willing to do thi s. We are grateful for WHO's continued normative lead ership role as well as its commitment to guaranteeing provision of appropriate emergency tec hnical support in times of epidemics and disasters, in this globalized environment. And that is why we, the Ministers of Health of the African Region, laud the proactive and effective leadership of Dr Margaret Chan during this period of the financial global crisis and pandemic (H1N1) 2009. As President Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, has said time and time again, Africa is not poor. It is a continent of innovation and progress. In Rwanda, leadership, ownership and country-led health strategies have a demonstrable effect on the health of the poor. Life expectancy is up. Malaria morbidity and mortality have seen a 60% reduction i n three years, partly through community-based and facility-based audits and investments, with an obligation to report. Maternal death has dropped thirteenfold in one year alone from 2875 deaths a y ear to 224 last year. Insurance coverage is at 92% and vaccination rates are above 95%. Health indicat ors are part of the performance contracts local authorities sign with the Head of State and health workers, including community health workers, are not merely given salaries but are remunerated based on their performance through results-based financing, with a dramatic improvement in the quali ty of service. Mr President, what is happening in my country can be and is being replicated elsewhere on our continent. It simply requires clarity of purpose an d sustained engagement of national and internationa l partners. There is no doubt in my mind that with yo ur leadership, the leadership of the Director- General of WHO and her team, we will be able to hav e this clarity of purpose and this sustained engagement. I thank you for your kind attention. A63/VR/3 page 25 La Sra. JIM\u00c9NEZ GARC\u00cdA-HERRERA a Europea.

Today, on behalf of the entire United States Government, I can tell you we are committed to working with everyone in this room to expand access to health care, to reduce health disparities, advance social justice and improve the health of all nations. Last year, at this time when we were together, man y of us were focused on a dangerous pandemic that threatened communities around the wor ld, especially our children. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 challenged our global health response and we m et that challenge. Thanks to the efforts of people in this room, and under the leadership of Director- General Chan, we avoided the worst predictions. While some have questioned the actions taken by the international community, the outcomes speak for themselves. I believe we made the right decisions a t the right time. Our H1N1 response reflected a growing understanding around the world that global health is a shared responsibility, that we all have an obligation and an interest in promoting the heal th of all people. The highest expressions of that commitment are the Millennium Development Goals. This year, two-thirds of the way to 2015, we have an important milestone for those Goals. Over the last decade, we have had some notable successes . For the United States, they have included programmes like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the President's Malaria Initiative and we feel privileged to have contribut ed through these programmes towards the world's great progress on Millennium Development Goal 6. Wh ile much remains to be done in the fight against killer infections like HIV/AIDS, tuberculos is and malaria, we can all be encouraged by the gains we have made. But we cannot be complacent. That is why President Obama has launched an historic six-year Global Health Initiative that meets and expands our existing commitments to programmes that promote health in some of the poorest countries aro und the world. The Initiative builds on our successes while also accelerating progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, where we are lagging behind, and I am speaking specifically on r educing child mortality and improving maternal heal th. While some gains have been made in this area, mothe rs and children, as the previous speaker from Spain noted, continue to die at disturbingly high r ates. It is not that we do not know how to save tho se lives: we have proven evidence-based interventions that we know can improve maternal and child health. That is why our Global Health Initiative wi ll expand our efforts to make pregnancy and childbirth safer, increase the availability of fami ly planning and other reproductive health services and strengthen health systems to respond better to the needs of women and girls. Earlier this year, we marked the fifteenth anniver sary of the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women and together we drew the import ant connection between the Beijing Platform for Action and the achievement of the Millennium De velopment Goals. We understand today that these goals are tied together and that the empowerm ent of women and girls is important for meeting any of them, particularly when it comes to health. Because of women's role in child-rearing, providing and seeking care and managing household resources, the ability of women to access health-related A63/VR/3 page 27 knowledge and services also affects the health and stability of the entire community. By taking a woman- and girl-centred approach in our Global Heal th Initiative, we expect the benefits to ripple through societies. Over the last year, we have also learnt that progr ess can bring new challenges. We have made great strides for example in reducing undernutritio n around the world, but in some of the same countries where we worry about hunger, obesity and chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, are now a growing concern. I commend the H ealth Assembly for taking up issues on noncommunicable diseases during this meeting and lo ok forward to working with all of you to promote better health in these areas. As our busy agendas this week demonstrate there is much work left to be done, but today at my second Health Assembly, I can tell you that the Uni ted States is more committed than ever to following through on our shared commitments on glob al health and building a healthier world for all people. Thank you. /meemisolated/yehmedial/seenmedial/aleffinal/qafmedial/lamisolated/alefisolated /rehisolated/wawisolated/tehmedial/kafmedial/dalisolated/lamisolated/alefisolated ) 66.4% 1995 5/10 DOTS 30 1.4 2009 4 Mr AZAD (India): Mr President, Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General o f WHO, excellencies, distinguished delegates, it is an honour to address this august g athering of the world leaders in health. A63/VR/3 page 31 To each of you, I bring with me greetings from the people of India. On behalf of the Government of India and on my own behalf, I would l ike to extend my heartiest congratulations to you, Mr President, on your election as President of the Health Assembly for the year 2010. I would also like to take this opportunity to compliment th e Director-General of WHO on her untiring efforts to place the public health agenda high on the list of global priorities for development. The Millennium Development Goals have influenced a ll bilateral and multilateral dialogue and influenced the domestic policies of many countries. Over the years, India has revised its own policies and strategies with the aim of achieving the Goals related to health. I am happy to inform you that, a s acknowledged in the recent article of the well know n international journal, The Lancet , India has been showing a systematic decline of 4% per year in mate rnal mortality. With the rapid expansion in access to institution delivery due to a conditional cash t ransfer programme, we expect a dramatic reduction i n the maternal mortality ratio in the near future. I am happy to state that, under the infectious dis ease control programme, we have been able to avert more than two million deaths on account of tu berculosis with the scaling-up of the DOTS programme throughout the country. Against the Millennium Development Goal target of mortality reduction by 50% by 2015, we have already achieved a 68% reduction. We are now c oncentrating our energies on those districts that have yet to achieve the international benchmarks of 70% case detection and 85% cure rate. DOTS-Plus for the management of multi-drug resistant tubercul osis has now been rolled out in the country. The HIV/AIDS programme has done extremely well in my country. India is showing a downward trend in the incidence of new infections d ue to the multi-pronged strategy of scaled-up access to critical services, behavioural change amo ng the high-risk groups and treatment for AIDS patients. I am happy to inform your excellencies th at India's prevention strategy is now universally acknowledged as being the most cost-effective. Preliminary reports of a recent study on the impac t of our strategy shows that we may have averted 50% of all potential infections. This is in deed a very noteworthy development. One of the major initiatives is the federal support to strengt hening public health systems in the state governmen ts through the National Rural Health Mission. This yea r, the thrust has been on health equity with an emphasis on poor-performing districts and a wide-ra nging set of programmes of skilled human resources in these districts. There has been substa ntial addition to health human resources. Some 700 000 community health workers and over 100 000 d octors, nurses and paramedics have been added during the last five years in rural health care. While we are doing our best to achieve the Millenn ium Development Goals, we also look forward to proactive measures from WHO. We need to provide our people with access to low-cost and good-quality vaccines and drugs and to drive down p rices aggressively. The Indian vaccine industry is producing high-quality vaccines at an affordable pr ice for the domestic and global markets. It is important that the WHO prequalification process sho uld be expedited to further facilitate Indian vaccine manufacturers in playing a wider role in as suring the global security of vaccines. Similarly, low-cost, good-quality generic drugs make medical t reatment a viable option for many countries, particularly the poor countries. We need to steer c lear of commercially motivated debates over \"counterfeit\" drugs that have only hampered public health by preventing access to good-quality, low- cost generic drugs. We also need to urgently resolv e the deadlock over sharing virus vaccines and other benefits. We firmly believe that virus-sharin g and benefit-sharing must be on an equal footing. I would like to conclude by saying that the promot ion of good health values and of low-cost, good-quality generic drugs and vaccines is key to a chieving the Millennium Development Goals within the stipulated timelines. With concerted act ion and a focused approach, we need to strive towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals to which we are committed. Thank you for your kind attention. Dr MOTSOALEDI (South Africa): Mr President, Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, honourable members, colleagues, on behalf of the South African delegation, I wish to congratu late you on your election and wish you all the best A63/VR/3 page 32 for the duration of your tenure. I also wish to con gratulate the Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, for the inspiring speech she delivered today. This year is a historic year for Africa. In 25 day s, the first ever FIFA Soccer World Cup on the African continent will kick off in South Africa. So uth Africa is ready to welcome the world. We wish those who will be joining us an enjoyable stay. The health sector has been preparing for years for thi s event and we have worked with WHO and other partner s. I want to allay fears regarding concerns that have been raised regarding Rift Valley fever. There was a case about a German tourist which started pan demonium within some media circles, especially in Europe, which was just one of the many false ala rms that are recently being raised about the continent of Africa. Both the Bernhard Nocht Instit ute for Tropical Medicine in Germany and our own National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Sou th Africa have confirmed that it was not a Rift Valley fever viral infection. However, we are conti nually and effectively monitoring all diseases, including Rift Valley fever. This is what any healt h system in any part of the world is expected to do anyway. The Health Assembly this year will review progress made towards the Millennium Development Goals. Independent reviews have clearly shown that in sub-Saharan Africa, the goals will never be achieved by 2015. My country is one o f those which were found to be lagging behind. I am committed to changing this situation and I wis h to share my hope and conviction with all my colleagues who have to meet this target that this s ituation can be reversed. We are hopeful that this will be within the five years that we have until 20 15. We intend to introduce simpler basic interventions to bring down the disgracefully high mortality rates. We will learn from the experience of those countries and Member States that brought d own maternal mortality ratios from around 250-450 in the 1960s, to around 25 in 1990. The sim ple measures we are referring to are mainly about doing the right things, at the right place and at t he right time. These interventions are well documented. Our commitment is also to the number of children u nder five who die each year. Sadly, most of them die from conditions which can be prevented and which are treatable. Every one of these children deserves an equal chance of survival. We all have a responsibility to act and we are doing so in South Africa. That is why massive child immunization camp aigns in my country were launched last month. As a country, we also know that the main causes of maternal and child mortality are associated with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. It is for this reas on that our response to improve maternal and child mortality rates includes effective measures to figh t HIV/AIDS. We are determined to launch a new trajectory in this regard. HIV/AIDS is the most com plex and devastating infection that humanity has ever been confronted with. South Africa is respondi ng aggressively to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and as with many of the most successful public health i nterventions in the world, we are certain that it i s the simple, sensible things that will bring good re sults. World AIDS Day 2009 was a historic day for South A frica in the fight against HIV/AIDS. On this day, which was also attended by the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Mr Michel Sidib\u00e9, President Zuma made far-reaching announcements whereby treatm ent was to be upgraded for certain categories of vulnerable people consistent with WHO guidelines . He also announced that massive prevention strategies would be undertaken within society. I am happy to announce that from 1 April, we have actually implemented the new treatment regimens in South Africa. The history of HIV/AIDS response has been one of demanding action. It has changed th e frontiers of public health. It is for this reason that the effectiveness and success of our response are underpinned by the deployment of South African society itself, led by President Jacob Zuma, and wi th leadership from all the sectors: political, soci al and economic. This bold and ambitious programme was launched in my country on 25 April; under it 15 million South Africans will be tested for HIV/AI DS by 2011. We have decided to include other noncommunicable diseases in this programme so these 15 million South Africans will also be tested for blood sugar, blood pressure, haemoglobin and tu berculosis. In addition, we are offering pap smears for every woman who tests positive and we hope this will be extended to other women in due course. We have further started massive male medical circum cision, ending a history of 200 years of non- circumcision in one of the biggest tribal groups in South Africa, the Zulu Nation. A63/VR/3 page 33 Mr President, in conclusion, permit me to thank th e WHO Director-General and other United Nations agencies and our development partners for t heir support in the past year. We will work in partnership with other countries in the African Reg ion and beyond to improve the lives of our people. Ms STR\u00d8M-ERICHSEN (Norway): President, Director-General, excellences, ladies a nd gentlemen, in September the world's leaders will meet in New York to discuss the Millen nium Development Goals. Improved health reduces both poverty and security threats. We need to constantly remind ourselves that the poor especially women and children, are the most vulnera ble. Health is the key to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. To succeed, all stake holders must make concrete contributions. WHO has a special role to play. It must be in the f orefront in promoting the health-related Millennium Development Goals. My Government has made a firm co mmitment to promoting women's and children's health as reflected in Goals 4 and 5. WH O should strengthen its engagement in the inherent health challenges of climate change. Poverty and hu nger will increase. Access to clean drinking-water be reduced, the impact on global health is severe. Many of us are facing huge demographic changes. Ou r population is ageing posing challenges to our health systems. Not only is there a global l ack of health personnel, but the need for health personnel is increasing in many parts of the world. The peak of this crisis is still to be seen. It is obvious that committed international cooperation is essential. Agreement on a voluntary code of practice, as presented to this Health Assembly, is urgent. The rise in noncommunicable diseases also increase s the importance of the principle of health in all policies as public health must be reflected in all sectors of government. More structural measures need to be put in place. Norway warmly welcomes the proposal for a strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. Norway would also like to propose a resolution to accompany the proposed recommendations on marketing of unhealthy food and beverages to children. This is a vital tool in our efforts to prevent obesity. To provide the right he alth services at the right level and at the right c ost is a challenge to all of us. Health services founded on a good primary health care are the best and most cost-effective approach. An increased focus of WHO on health systems strengthening is overdue, and I warmly welcome it. Our health systems also face a c hange in the burden of disease. While communicable diseases have traditionally contribute d most of the burden of diseases, noncommunicable diseases today account for around 6 0% of the total burden, and their share of the disease burden is expected to increase in the years to come. I also welcome the strategy on WHO's role and resp onsibility in health research. We need to obtain knowledge that ensures that the policies ado pted and measures taken are evidence-based. A clearly defined role for WHO is of crucial importan ce. Norway is providing support for health systems research to make health systems more effective. In order to deliver on their mandate, the United N ations organizations, including WHO, need to strengthen their cooperation at all levels. In part icular, WHO and other United Nations organizations have to strengthen their efforts to ensure a United Nations that \"delivers as one\" at the country leve l. I am also happy to note the collaboration established between the seven countries in the foreign policy and global health initiative. The seven Foreign Min isters have taken a special interest in making foreign policies responsive to health. We appreciat e the working relationship with the Director- General and WHO in this respect, reflecting our exc ellent cooperation. Norway has submitted a candidate for the Executive Board this week, with the aim of being an active contributor to the Board's discussions if el ected. I highly welcome the initiative taken by the Director-General to discuss the future financing an d priorities of the Organization. Norway supports a strong WHO. Norway looks forward to working with Me mber States to strengthen the role of WHO in promoting the health of the peoples of the world.

Por ello, Asamblea Mundial Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud, me en (Canada): President, distinguished delegates, Canada is plea sed to be a part of the Sixty-third World Health Assembly. Canada recognizes that there are m any global health issues that need to be addressed. And the solutions will come only through international collaboration and mutual support. Regardless of the distance between us, all of the nations of the world are increasingly linked: whether preparing for or responding to infectious d iseases, or whether dealing with the global supply of food, medicines and products, or confronting a c atastrophic disaster or noncommunicable disease, we benefit from working together. We need to share our knowledge and best practices in order to find innovative solutions; the spread of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus has served as a reminder that the transmission of infections does not respect borders. That is why international collaboration and regulations are critical in responding to emerging health challenges. As you kn ow, Canada was among the first countries affected by H1N1. We recognized how important it wa s to quickly share information and specimens with other Member States through work done at the P ublic Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory. Information-sharing and co llaboration in laboratory diagnosis were instrumental in the early recognition of the outbre ak, and we welcome the opportunity to address lessons learnt. Canada was able to deliver on its I nternational Health Regulations obligations through the initial H1N1 response, including notifying WHO within 24 hours of our first laboratory confirmed cases. We continued to share information with PAHO/ WHO throughout the H1N1 response. Canada looks forward to working with the WHO Secre tariat and Member States to share the lessons we have learnt in order to better prepare f or, and respond to, future threats to global public health. We were especially gratified by the number of Canadians immunized and the ability of provincial governments at all levels that provided an effective response in remote and isolated populations. International collaboration also gives us a chance to share best practices we can use to respond to the health issues that we have in common . For example, we can share our experiences in delivering health services to indigenous peoples an d in rural and remote settings. Canada welcomes the collaboration with other countries on this very important issue. Canada has also been very active in the internatio nal response to the devastating earthquake in Haiti. We will continue to support the Haitian peop le by helping with humanitarian relief in the short - term and the long-term reconstruction of the countr y. To that end, Canada has cancelled Haiti's bilateral debts, so those financial resources can i nstead be put directly towards reconstruction. At a meeting of the G7 hosted in Canada's Arctic and my home territory of Nunavut, Canada also led a consensus to forgive all Haitian debt to internatio nal financial institutions. A decade has passed since the signing of the Unite d Nations Millennium Declaration. A great deal has already been achieved towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals, but much more has to be done if we are to meet our deadlines of 2 015. Holding this year's G8 Presidency, Canada is championing a major initiative to improve maternal, newborn and under-five child health in developing countries. Canada will be making this a priority at the G8 Muskoka Summit in June. Our preparations for the G8 Summit are being done in co nsultation with the WHO and many other partners. Dr Chan, I would like to thank you and yo ur staff for your ongoing support and advice to the Government of Canada in the development of this ini tiative. As I conclude, I am happy to indicate that Canada is very pleased to be sponsoring a resolution at this Health Assembly - on advancing food safety. I believe that it is timely to advance this resolution as there is a requirement for greater gl obal attention and recognition in this area. I wish to assure you that Canada is committed to the strategi c priority set out by the WHO. I believe our deliberations at this Health Assembly will make a d ifference, and I am confident that together we can achieve health outcomes that will benefit us all. A63/VR/3 page 36 Dr NELSON (Australia): Director-General, President and Vice-Presidents of the Health Assembly, honourable ministers, distinguished guests, excellencies, ladies and gent lemen, the Millennium Development Goals have served to focus international efforts to address th e health challenges faced by the world's poorest countries. Australia is strongly committed to the a chievement of these Goals, and in our 2010-2011 financial year, we will provide AS$ 555 million in aid, or 14% of our total overseas development aid - our largest ever investment in reducing poverty and achieving sustainable development. We are committed to increasing our development assistance to 0.5% of gross national income by 2015-2016. We are also expanding the geographical scope of our support to, for example, Africa in areas such as maternal and child health. In our own region, the Asia-Pacific, we are workin g closely with partner countries to move towards achievement of Millennium Development Goals 4, 5 and 6, through making health systems work better and targeting specific interventions. T he fruits of our investments are clear. For example , in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, malaria-control activities such as the distribution of insecticide - treated bednets have resulted in large decreases in malaria incidence. Maternal mortality, Goal 5, remains the area where progress is weakest. We know what works, and countries such as Nepal, the Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka and Thailand, which have instituted measures to increase access to emergency obstetric care, skilled birth attendants and family planning, have been successful in reducing maternal deaths. Australia is helping partner countries scale up th ese approaches through both specific activities, such as training of midwives and other health worke rs, and approaches that boost the ability of the entire health system to provide high-quality access ible services. We are starting to see progress. For example, in one pilot district in Bangladesh, mater nal mortality has decreased from 256 per 100 000 live births in 2007 to 171 only two years later, in 2009. These successes show that achievement of the healt h-related Millennium Development Goals is within reach. More resources are needed but equally critical is an increased emphasis on effectiveness , efficiency and impact. Development partners must co ntinue to better harmonize and align their efforts with country priorities. We also call on WHO to enh ance timely dissemination of information with all Member States on \"what works and what does not work \" and how to translate this into \"policy and action\" in order to achieve the health-related Goal s by 2015. In turning to our own health-care system and measu res we are taking to improve women's and children's health in Australia, improving the healt h and well-being of all women in our country, especially those with the highest risk of poor heal th, is a priority for the Australian Government. Indeed it is developing a new National Women's Heal th Policy to encourage specific health services for women to encourage participation in health deci sion-making and management and promote health equity between women. The Policy will focus on prev ention, health inequalities in our societies and the social determinants of those inequalities, and is due for release this year. In 2009, after a comprehensive review of maternity services, our Government announced measures in improving choice and access to maternit y services for pregnant women and new mothers. The package also recognizes the important role play ed by qualified midwives in the birthing experience of women. A comprehensive plan for mater nity services in the future is also being developed. To improve indigenous maternal and child health outcomes, our Government is investing in targeted initiatives such as expanded mothers an d babies services and the Australian Nurse-Family Partnership Program of home visits. The health-rela ted Millennium Development Goals are key to our regional and global health objectives, and Australi a will continue to work closely with our regional partners and global community to help achieve them. You can rely on Australia. Thank you. Mr JURIN LAKSANAWISIT (Thailand): Mr President, Madam Director-General, honourable m inisters, ladies and gentlemen, I know that all of you are concerned about the events now unfolding in Thailand. I wish to assure you that th e Thai Government is determined to do all it can to d eter further violence and bring the country back to normal as soon as possible based on internationally accepted measures. A63/VR/3 page 37 Mr President, Thailand achieved the Millennium Dev elopment Goals well before 2015. Poverty incidence dropped from 27.2% in 1990 to 9.8% in 200 2. The prevalence of underweight children dropped from 18.6% to 8.5% between 1990 and 2000. A nnual new HIV infections have dropped by over 80% since 1991. Three important political commitments allowed us t o achieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals. First, continuous investment in health; we have achieved universal coverage of essential health infrastructure since the mid-1980s . Second, sustainable investment in human resources, this includes the continuous and intensi ve scaling-up of production of community health workers and rural health nurses complemented by com pulsory rural services for all medical and nursing graduates as well as extensive recruitment and support to around one million village health volunteers in the last three decades. Third, extens ion of our financial risk protection; Thailand has achieved universal coverage of health interims sinc e 2001, through step-wise gradual coverage. The current Government further commits to health i nvestments through the following: first, maintaining adequate resources for health. In spite of the 2009 financial crisis, the 2010 budget for universal coverage increased by 9%, while overall t he Government budget decreased by 12%. And for 2011, the health budget will increase by 6% over 20 10. Second, expanding coverage to \"stateless people\". In March this year, the Cabinet approved t he additional budget of US$ 14 million for essential health care to half a million stateless p eople. This is to underscore our policy of ensuring the right to health and basic health-care services for all, regardless of nationality. Third, next year th e Government will invest more than US$ 700 million to upgrade 10 000 rural health centres to health- promoting hospitals, as well as strengthening secon dary and tertiary care. In January 2011 the Thai Ministry of Public Health , together with the Prince Mahidol Award Foundation, WHO and partners will jointly host the Fifth International Award Conference under the theme \"Reviewing progress, renewing commitment to h ealth workers towards the MDGs and beyond\". We believe that this Conference will serve as one of the important global movements to tackle the health workforce crisis. Mr President, we are very glad and would like to s incerely commend WHO, led by the Director- General, Dr Margaret Chan, for its decision to publ ish The World Health Report 2010 on the theme of universal access to essential health services. In c onclusion, Thailand is ready to learn from, and sha re information with, other countries on experiences in promoting public health. Dr MADZORERA (Zimbabwe): Mr President, Director-General, distinguished dele gates, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating you, Mr President, on being elected to lead our deliberations. I stood before this august house at about the same time last year, and shared with you the state of health in Zimbabwe at the inception of our inclu sive Government. I feel duty bound today to update this same house on the situation as it relates to o ur country after a whole year of hard work and cohesive action in matters relating to health. At t his time last year, Zimbabwe was in the middle of a pervasive cholera outbreak that started in August 2 008, infecting nearly 100 000 people and causing close to 4300 deaths. With the help of local, regio nal and international partners largely coordinated by the WHO Country Office in Harare, this outbreak was eventually declared over in July 2009. Let me use this opportunity to thank all our friends and p artners who gave a helping hand in our time of need . I am happy to announce that the continued alertness , intense health education campaigns and prompt and appropriate responses to reported outbreaks hav e seen us prevent another potential catastrophe, in spite of the fact that most of the risk factors pre disposing us to such outbreaks have not yet been adequately addressed. I also indicated to you last year that we were lik ely going to see, in the foreseeable future, the negative effects of a decade of economic regression . Indeed, the outbreak of measles that we currently face, although generally a regional challenge, has been made worse in our country by the poor routine immunization coverage over the last decade. We are sparing no effort to control this outbreak, with th e involvement of our leadership at the highest level, and we expect to be on top of the situation soon. I shared with you last year the difficult situatio n we were in regarding our human resources for health. I am glad to report that there has been mas sive improvement in that area. Health professionals A63/VR/3 page 38 are back to work thanks to the staff retention sche me supported initially by some partners and now by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Mal aria. Indeed we have even been able to attract back some of the health workers who had joined the diaspora. This effort, added to current health worker training outputs, has seen us actually fill all available posts in the categories of general nu rses, laboratory technicians and pharmacy technicians amo ng others. We still need, however, to build up post-basic specialization in areas such as midwifer y, nurse anaesthetists, mental health, theatre nurs es and others, and to beef up our complement of midwif ery tutors, doctors, specialists and university lecturers. It is sad to note the loss of the more e xperienced staff to other countries in the region a nd beyond. This continues unabated, albeit at a lower pace. We therefore eagerly anticipate the finalization and immediate implementation of the dr aft code of practice on the international recruitment of health personnel for the mutual bene fit of all countries and for the creation of a glob e suitable for human habitation. All of our over 1500 public health institutions ar e now open and offering services at various levels from primary care to tertiary level. We have come up with a partner-supported primary care package of drugs and sundries to cover common ailme nts. This package is made available through an informed push system to all our primary health care institutions. As a result of this intervention, th e availability of vital drugs now averages 60% and co ntinues to improve. The Government of Zimbabwe has embarked on a healt h infrastructure rehabilitation programme. This is a targeted approach to health in stitution rehabilitation to ensure that our infrastructure is supportive of health service deli very. The Government has prioritized health care an d is doing everything possible to ensure that health care is funded. However, although a significant proportion of the overall funding to the health sec tor is still provided by donors, this funding is no t coming directly through Government institutions, le ading to a certain lack of flexibility in the use o f funds, and creating structures parallel to Governme nt ones. In fact these nongovernmental structures often end up stronger and more capacitated than the custodians of public health delivery in the country. Earlier in the year, we finalized and comm issioned our Five-year National Strategic Plan, which details our vision for health in Zimbabwe, an d we implore our partners to operate within this strategic framework. We recently completed building an Investment Case for Zimbabwe using the Marginal Budgeting for Bottlenecks tool with the assistance of UNICEF and the World Bank. The tool showed that we need to invest an additional US$ 700 millio n over the next three years to make significant progress towards attaining our Millennium Developme nt Goals. We are definitely back on track, and we look forward to rapid acceleration of those high -impact interventions that we have identified. The Plan is currently being considered by the Cabinet, and we hope to host a health-sector investment conference soon. Lastly, Mr President, let me acknowledge with than ks the assistance we are receiving from WHO towards preparedness against pandemic (H1N1) 20 09. We have finalized our pandemic (H1N1) 2009 epidemic preparedness plan, vaccine deployment plan and communication strategy. As a country we are ready to deploy the vaccine as soon as it ar rives. We remain resolute to deliver the highest possible quality of health to our citizens to continue strengthening our primary health-care approach and to involve communities in defining their health priorities and giving them a full mandate for local decision-making in managing their own resources for health and the future is very bright.

A63/VR/3 page 40 Dr TEMPOR\u00c3O (Brazil) ( interpretation from the Portuguese ):1 Mr President, Madam Director-General, ministers, h eads of delegation, ladies and gentlemen, health promotion requires a whole series of measure s to tackle causes comprehensively and help treat diseases. This being so, all of the Millennium Deve lopment Goals are related to health. If hunger and poverty are not eliminated, if education is not imp roved, if gender equality is not promoted, if environmental sustainability is not attained, if th ere is no international cooperation, if peace is no t achieved - all of which are objectives that Brazil is resolutely pursuing - our efforts will be in vai n. In Brazil, we have been able to take two large ste ps towards the achievement of these Goals. Between 1990 and 2008, we reduced infant mortality rates by 58%, and the country will accomplish Millennium Development Goal 4 before 2015 even thou gh regional disparities remain to be addressed. Maternal mortality in 2007 had already decreased by half in comparison with 1990 rates. The consistent decrease in vertical transmission of HIV and the significant reduction in the number of cases of malaria and tuberculosis reflect the succe ss of governmental policies related to Goal 6 in Br azil. This holistic view demands bold action on the socia l determinants of health. In Alma-Ata in 1978, we took a significant step as we signed the Universal Commitment to Health for All with primary health care as its main strategy. Now, it is time to once again honour the pledge and advance towards the achievement of broad consensus about results of the Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, in line with resolution WHA62.14. With this in mind, Brazil will have the honour of hosting the World Conference on the Social Determinants of Health in Rio de Janeiro in October 2011. We should reach the necessary agreements that will tur n health, the most basic aspiration of every human being, into a fundamental part of all state policie s, thereby making it truly universal. Our common path towards the achievement of the Mil lennium Development Goals is winding and full of obstacles, including those of a financi al nature which are especially harmful during the ongoing economic crisis. One year ago, during the S ixty-second World Health Assembly, we were facing the great challenge of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, which was rightly considered a pandemic by WHO. Today, we have before us an even greater chall enge: to learn the lessons of this recent past and pave our way towards the Millennium Development Goa ls. On the brink of the influenza pandemic in 2009, our countries rapidly shared the virus, inspi red by the commitment to cooperate in the struggle against a common evil. Regrettably, however, the so lidarity in sharing the viruses gave way to a slow and insufficient sharing of benefits. This is a str uctural imbalance we members of WHO have to rectify. The increase in the capacity of developing countries to produce vaccines, antivirals and diagnosis kits is essential to correct this distort ion and to ensure that public health will prevail o ver any other interests or purposes. In spite of these challenges, Brazil has been making substantial effo rts to reduce the impact of this pandemic, and in the n ext few weeks we will conclude the largest vaccination strategy ever undertaken, which aims at vaccinating 90 million people from the most vulnerable groups. Disease treatment and prevention depend on one key element: health workers. Without them we will never reach our objectives, including the Mill ennium Development Goals. Emigration of these professionals from poor countries without any contr ol or compensation weakens social policies and condemns developing countries to a permanent setbac k in the area of health. The draft resolution on the code of practice for the international recruitm ent of health workers before this Health Assembly should constitute a tool to enhance international s olidarity and offer fair solutions to enable the mo st vulnerable countries to address this complex challe nge. The importance of the issue inspired the group on foreign policy and global health to consider it a priority, as reflected by its inclusion as one of the main themes of the United Nations General Assembly resolution presented to the group in 2009. The participation of civil society in the efforts to promote public health is essential. Brazil has benefitted greatly from its involvement. The Nation al Health Council, on which civil society is represented, will organize a first world conference on the development of universal social security systems in December 2010, an event to which I have the pleasure to invite you all. 1 In accordance with Rule 89 of the Rules of Procedu re of the World Health Assembly. A63/VR/3 page 41 The attainment of the Millennium Development Goals , in particular Goal 6, demands coordinated action to prevent and treat specific diseases. WHO must engage in the development of a global strategy 2011-2015 to combat HIV/AIDS that will rei nforce actions related to viral hepatitis and publicize information and promote its prevention an d cure. Furthermore, it is essential to implement the new global strategy 2011-2015 to combat Hansen' s disease, approved in New Delhi by 44 endemic countries with an emphasis on reduction of new cases. This strategy should be a starting point for the expert meeting to take place in the s econd semester, as agreed at the last session of th e Executive Board. Noncommunicable diseases are the most lethal illne sses today. It is our urgent duty to promote prevention and treatment of these diseases, which l ead to 60% of deaths worldwide and 80% in the developing world. The recent adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of a resolution in this respect is an important step towards enhancing visi bility of these diseases, which are as lethal as th ey are neglected. The Millennium Development Goals are more than objectives. They are challenges that stimulate us to collaborate for a better future. Th ey inspire solidarity and joint efforts. This is th e spirit that ought to guide us all. Access to safe, efficient and quality medicines is crucial to guarantee a well-structured health system. Generic medicines, which are more accessibl e, constitute an essential instrument for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. It is the respons ibility of WHO to promote access to health products and strengthen regulatory national authori ties. The merits of the Brazilian regulatory system were recently recognized by the Pan American Health Organization, which certified Anvisa as a reference authority. Combating falsified medicines, which is our common endeavour, cannot serve as an excuse to allow commercial interests to prevail ove r public health. Intellectual property rights have nothing to do with falsified medicines. Victims of intellec tual property right violations are enterprises. Vic tims of falsified medicines are patients, and these pati ents are the ones who require the protection of WHO . Mr President, as the deadline for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals approaches, it becomes ever more urgent to effectiv ely implement the global strategy and plan of action on public health, intervention and intellect ual property. The greatest challenges to the attainment of the Goals are in the developing world , and it is to the benefit of the developing world that the global strategies should be orientated. So uth America is setting an example in this respect. Prior to this Health Assembly, we, health ministers of the Union of South American Nations, gathered in Ecuador to discuss the efforts to achieve the Mi llennium Development Goals through universal access to medication as well as universal access to good quality health systems, capacity building of human resources, action on the social determinants of health, and the enhancement of innovative financing mechanisms for research and development i n health. Mrs G.A.A. Gidlow (Samoa), Vice-President, took the presidential chair. Mme G.A.A. Gidlow (Samoa), Vice-Pr\u00e9sident, assume l a of Bismillah ar-rahman arrahim. Madam Vice-President, Madam Director-General, excel lencies, honourable delegates, ladies and gentlemen, congrat ulations to you, Madam President, and to the Bureau on your deserved election. I wish you every success in steering the work of this Health Assembly. My word of appreciation also goes to the Director-General and her capable staff for all the preparations. Indeed pressing needs have compelled us to convene and engage in a high-level dialogue on the health-related Millennium Development Goals. WHO's report on the status of progress towards the Goals suggests that implementation has been slow an d uneven across and within Goals and regions. While progress in some regions is recognizable, in many parts of our world, the health-related Goals seem to be hard to reach. Overall, we lag behind ac hieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, and this should be truly alarming. The Islamic Republic of Iran, while facing challen ges, has made considerable progress on the health-related Goals. On under-five and infant mort ality rates as well as on the proportion of one-yea r-old children immunized against measles, we are close to achieving the targets. The same applies to A63/VR/3 page 42 maternal mortality rates, the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel, as well as neonatal and postnatal care coverage. Iran is among the pioneer countries with a Multisectoral National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS, which includes application of the \"Three Ones\" principle. On tuberculosis, Iran has already achieved the goal of 100% coverage of DOTS. On malaria, and in spite of our significant achievements, there are still co ncerns over the situation in just three south-easte rn border provinces. We, like many countries, still su ffer from uneven progress. Shortfalls in achieving the Millennium Development Goals are, to a large extent, due to the absence of an enabling international environment. G lobal imbalances and inequities, coupled with multiple global economic, financial and food crises , further impoverish the poorest. The developing countries are faced with growing vulnerability, due to actions originating in the developed countries. We are deeply concerned over the risk of diversion of attention from achieving the Goals, during recovery from the current economic crisis. Foreign occupation and application of political conditionalities and unilateral sanctions against d eveloping countries, continue to hamper their effor ts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. I wish , in particular, to mention the politically motivated impediments to developing countries' acce ss to peaceful nuclear energy for, among others, public health purposes. To achieve the health-related 2015 targets, we req uire a renewed global partnership on the following areas: to eliminate global systemic inequ ities and their inherent risks through concerted efforts; to provide developing countries with polic y space to develop their own strategies tailored to their requirements and ensure their meaningful part icipation in global economic governance; to address the Millennium Development Goals, mobilizat ion of substantial resources, in addition to what can be generated domestically, is required; commitm ents made at United Nations conferences, in particular on flows of official development assista nce, should be honoured; developed partners should adhere to good governance by subjecting themselves to the same standards of transparency and coherence as they expect from developing countries; technology, knowledge and information are public goods and global assets - relaxing protectiv e measures and providing an unimpeded and universal access to them are absolute requirements; the United Nations system, including WHO, should be enabled to provide effective coordination and policy coherence and monitor implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. Madam Vice-President, honourable delegates, in con clusion we need to move beyond formalities. The Health Assembly should make its re al impact on speeding up the process of realization of the health-related Goals. Dr LIOW Tiong Lai (Malaysia): Honourable Chairperson, excellencies, ladies and g entlemen, first and foremost, the Government of Malaysia would like to thank Dr Marga ret Chan, the WHO Director-General, for having visited Malaysia in November 2009 and also f or officially opening the WHO Global Service Centre in Putrajaya, Malaysia. Malaysia would also like to record its thanks to the Director-General for WHO's contribution of 20 064 doses of Tamiflu\u00ae during the outbreak of pandemic (HINI) 2009 last year. Malaysia has made progress towards achieving its M illennium Development Goal targets, political stability, strong political will, commitm ent by health-care providers and policymakers contributed to this remarkable achievement in the h ealth status of the population. In line with Goals 4 and 5, the achievements thus far are shown by the m arked decline in the under-five mortality rate from 16.8 per 1000 live births in 1990 to 8.1 in 2008 an d in the infant mortality rate from 13 to 6.4 per 1000 live births for the same period of time. Simil arly, the maternal mortality ratio has declined fro m 44 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 1991 to 28.9 in 2008. The coverage for primary immunization is above 90% of the target population and for measles given in combination with mumps and rubella at one year reached 94.3% in 2008 . Deliveries conducted by trained personnel have increased from 92.8% in 1990 to 98.6% in 2008, while the adolescent birth rate declined from 28 per 1000 women in 1991 to 13 in 2007. The other factors that have contributed to the dec line in mortality include provision of trained delivery attendants to manage pregnancy and deliver y complications, a comprehensive childhood A63/VR/3 page 43 immunization programme and establishing the child m alnutrition programme. The challenges in achieving the targets for Millennium Development Go als 4 and 5 will require greater effort and focus on strengthening the referral feedback and retrieva l system at primary care level; improving knowledge and skills of health-care providers at al l levels of care; advocacy on breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices; family planning fo r high-risk mothers, especially for those with medical conditions; expanding the Integrated Manage ment of Childhood Illness programme to more areas; and prevention of childhood injuries. Other areas that require attention include increasing coverage of maternal and child health services to m arginalized groups such as the aborigines, urban poor and unmarried mothers. Pertaining to Goal 6, Malaysia's response to HIV/A IDS was characterized by high political commitment and our policy of openness about the epi demic that enhanced dialogue at the programme development and also implementation levels. Malaysi a has made significant progress by halting and reversing the trend of HIV/AIDS. The number of repo rted HIV/AIDS cases has declined from 6978 cases in 2002 to 3080 cases in 2009. Since 1986, a total of 87 710 HIV cases have been reported, of which 15 317 have been diagnosed to have AIDS, whil e there were 13 394 deaths. Malaysia achieved the Millennium Development Goal target for malaria by halving malaria incidence from 29 per 10 000 in 1990 to 2.5 in 2009. We are now moving towards t he Goal's last target of completely eliminating malaria infection by 2020. As for tuberculosis, Mal aysia has made some good progress, such as achieving the target of detecting 70% of estimated cases and successfully treating 85% of these cases. However, like many other countries, achieving this target for tuberculosis is a challenge. Malaysia is committed to the WHO's Strategic Plan to Stop TB in the Western Pacific, and we hope to achieve all th e targets set by 2015. As briefed to the Director-General during her visi t in November last year, Malaysia aspires to become a high-income country within which the healt h-care system will be transformed to meet the needs of the population. This initiative, called \"1 Care for 1 Malaysia\" brings a partnership between the public and private health-care providers. It is designed as an integrated health-care system that is responsive and provides choice of quality health ca re, enhancing universal coverage for the population , based on the concept of solidarity and equity. In t his endeavour, we must preserve the strength of our current health-care system which is acknowledged in ternationally. This initiative by Malaysia can also be an example for other developing countries facing similar challenges. Lastly, we would like to congratulate Dr Margaret Chan on her leadership during the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 crisis and look forward to seeing her i n Malaysia later this year for the meeting of the Regional Committee for the Western Pacific, which M alaysia will be hosting. Hopefully, she will be wearing the Malaysian batik that was presented to h er during her last visit. I thank you for your attention. Dr HAQUE (Bangladesh): Madam Chairperson, Madam Director-General, excelle ncies, distinguished delegations, ladies and gentlemen, Assalamu alaikum . It gives me a great pleasure to congratulate you on your election to the Chair. We are confident that under your able st ewardship, the Sixty-third World Health Assembly will achieve its mandated tasks. We would like to convey our appreciation to Dr Mar garet Chan, the Director-General of WHO, for her comprehensive and forward-looking statement . I would like to thank her for visiting Bangladesh in March 2010, and appreciating the comm endable efforts of Bangladesh under the leadership of the Honourable Prime Minister, Skeikh Hasina, towards achieving Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5. I particularly thank Dr Margaret Chan for personally visiting the work in progress at the community level. The overarching theme of this year's Health Assemb ly revolves around the progress made in the achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals 4, 5 and 6. In Bangladesh, we are on track to achieve Goal 4 on reducing under-five chil d mortality. A recent UNICEF report, Countdown to 2015 decade report , places Bangladesh among the 16 countries in a pos ition to do so. In 2007, the under-five mortality rate was 60, which is in fact a three-fifths reduction from the base year. A combined approach to immunization, diarrhoeal disea se control and Vitamin A supplementation A63/VR/3 page 44 programmes has significantly contributed to the dec line in child and infant deaths. In 2009, we passed a National Neonatal Strategy which, if implemented properly, will have a significant impact on newborn survival. Monitoring the exact progress in respect of Millen nium Development Goal 5 on reducing maternal mortality remains a challenge. Based on th e outcomes of the number of sub-national programmes, it can be concluded that, as in the cas e of most developing countries, we are not yet completely on track in achieving all target indicat ors for Goal 5. The presence of low-skilled professionals at the time of delivery still continu es, along with low institutional delivery. Low rate of antenatal care received, high adolescent fertility and around 20% unmet need for family planning are some of the key concerns that deserve priority atte ntion. Our initial focus on the supply side of service ut ilization resulted in lowering maternal mortality by almost half, from 574 in 1990 to an estimated 24 0 per 100 000 live births in 2010. However, we noticed that the rate of return on supply-side inve stments remained sub-optimal due to demand-side barriers. In 2004, we introduced an innovative dema nd-side financing intervention, the Maternal Health Voucher Scheme. Bangladesh has performed well in halting the commu nicable diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis under Millennium Development Goal 6. HIV/AIDS data reveal that the prevalence of HIV infections among adults is now 0.32 per 100 000 population, and it is estimated that it will be at 1.3 per 100 000 population by 2015. The disease is at an epidemic stage among the injecting drug- users in the large cities. The prevalence of malari a and tuberculosis show that Bangladesh will be abl e to halt the two diseases by 2015. In 2008, the prev alence of malaria was 59 per 100 000 population, and the prevalence of tuberculosis was 225 per 100 000 population in 2007. Effective public-private partnership in these areas has been one of the main driving forces behind the progress made and projected into the future. In order to sustain the momentum of the achievemen ts made, I would like to make the following observations in light of our experiences in Banglad esh. The renewal of primary health care can be instrumental in accelerating the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, especially in the low-income countries. In Bangladesh, we are working to establish and operationalize 18 000 community clinics across the country, with one such clinic fo r every 6 000 population. The health-sector initiatives need to be matched with substantial inv estments in the social determinants of health. The current Millennium Development Goal review process may consider incorporating specific target indicators for noncommunicable diseases for 2015 an d beyond in a realistic manner. Access to essential medicines, vaccines and diagnostic kits i s crucial for health security in the developing wor ld. WHO should continue to work for enhancing access to essential drugs and vaccines in this progress, and in Bangladesh we are in the process of producin g vaccines soon. The health dimension of climate change impact needs to be mainstreamed into the ong oing climate change negotiations in order to develop a holistic response to the rapidly evolving challenges. The international community should close ranks to develop innovative finance mechanism s to fill in the resources gaps in meeting the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Information a nd communication technologies have the potential to change the health-care delivery landsc ape in the developing world. WHO should use its expertise to develop the necessary standards for th e application of e-health facilities and assist countries in developing progressive national polici es in this regard. As regards mainstreaming of efforts, inclusion of common people in e-health pro jects in Bangladesh has been very effective. In our experience it is not the lack of innovative ideas or cost-effective schemes that hinders national progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Rather, it is the difficulties faced when attempting to scale up successful initia tives into national programmes. With its global presence, WHO is ideally suited to provide the nece ssary guidance in this regard. It is the collective responsibility of the membership to equip WHO finan cially and procedurally to undertake the enhanced and additional responsibilities that we ex pect the Organization to discharge. Thank you all for listening to me patiently. A63/VR/3 page 45 Mrs MUGO (Kenya): Madam Vice-President, distinguished delegates, the Kenyan delegation congratulates you on your election to steer this Sixty-third World Healt h Assembly. We also commend the Director-General for convening the Health Assembly and for her state ment. We have been reviewing our performance towards att aining the health-related Millennium Development Goals as we draw closer to 2015. Althou gh we are not on track on most of the indicators, a lot of progress has been made over th e last five to six years. In reducing child mortali ty, significant progress has been noted, with the under -five mortality rate falling from 115 per 1000 live births in 2003 to 74 per 1000 by 2008. Over the sam e period, infant mortality rate fell from 77 per 1000 live births to 52 per 1000. Similarly, neonata l mortality rate fell from 33 per 1000 live births to 31 per 1000. However, we are still not on track and a lot more needs to be done to improve these indices. In improving maternal health, the country is not on track, and maternal mortality rate is sti ll high at 410 per 100 000 live births. HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis remain the grea test causes of morbidity and mortality in the country. However, the country has registered so me successes in the fight against these diseases. I n the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, the AIDS In dicator Survey of 2008 revealed a prevalence of 7%. Currently over 370 000 people living with HI V receive antiretrovirals as compared with only 2000 people in 2003. About 30 0000 out of the 120 0 00 eligible children are also on antiretrovirals. Male circumcision has also picked up as an HIV-prev ention strategy, and over 90 000 people have undergone the procedure in targeted regions in the country. In malaria prevention and control, the country is on track towards attaining the Abuja targets for access to artemisinin-based combination therapies i n all public health facilities. In 2008-2009, about 3.4 million insecticide-treated nets were distribut ed to children under five years and pregnant women. Over the same period, 51% of children under five ye ars and 53% of pregnant women used such nets. Indoor residual spraying is carried out in all epid emic-prone districts and in some endemic areas. However, additional resources are required to susta in these gains and the strategies for the ultimate eradication of malaria. Our tuberculosis treatment success rate is 85.4% w hile the case detection rate is 80%. However, we face challenges with multidrug-resistant and ext ensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. There are about 800 detected cases of multidrug-resistant tub erculosis in the country and only 390 of these are being treated. The rest are at risk of spreading in fection. One case of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis has been detected and is being treated with WHO help. We urgently require support to provide treatment for all detected cases of multidr ug-resistant tuberculosis. We also request support to adopt rapid diagnostic methods for tuberculosis, im prove mop-up of undiagnosed cases and conduct tuberculosis mortality surveys. We further request WHO to advocate for the reduction of the price of second-line tuberculosis medicines. It is noted that strengthening of health systems i s key to attaining the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Over the last year, the country has adopted some innovative strategies to address this issue. Key among this has been the implementation o f an Economic Stimulus Programme, which includes the employment of 4200 additional nurses, the construction of 210 Model Health Centres and the provision of essential medicines to primary hea lth facilities. Through the Programme, we hope to improve access to health services at the primary le vel and thus address some of the key challenges faced in improving maternal and child health. We recognize the important role played by human re sources in health systems strengthening. We continue working towards having adequate health workers. Over the last five years, more than 6000 health workers have been recruited with resour ces from the Government and development partners. Currently we are implementing the Nationa l Human Resources for Health Strategy (2009-2012) which puts the emphasis on rational dis tribution of the health workforce in the country and human resource development. However, we still e xperience the challenge of inadequate health workers and insufficient funds in training. Kenya reiterates its commitment to the implementat ion of the International Health Regulations (2005). We are in the process of developing our min imum core capacities for surveillance and response. However, our key challenge is the strengt hening of ports of entry especially at border posts A63/VR/3 page 46 shared with countries experiencing political instab ility. This calls for regional collaboration in implementing the International Health Regulations ( 2005). We therefore request WHO to step up support in strengthening such collaboration. In conclusion, I would like to thank the Director- General for the 50 000 doses of Tamiflu\u00ae and 730 000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine that Kenya receiv ed recently from WHO. We are currently conducting an immunization drive that will cover 10 0 000 health workers, pregnant mothers and other at-risk groups. Mr YAAR (Israel): Madam Vice-President, distinguished ministers, dis tinguished delegates, the State of Israel, with its well-esteemed health system has long since achi eved in all terms the Millennium Development Goals. Low infant and maternal mortality, low HIV i ncidence, an efficient national tuberculosis control service that is well appreciated throughout the European Region, no local malaria case for several years and high-quality drinking-water acces sible to all in a region where water is a scarce commodity. Nevertheless, we all realize that the challenge in front of us all is for the global achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. This coming Septe mber, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a special high-level meeting on this very important issue. The situation does not bode well and too many countries are not on course to achieve the Goals by 2015. It is our common responsibility to work together and enhance these e fforts. Israel is committed and will pay its share to this global effort. For the last 52 years Israel, though MASHAV, its a gency for international development cooperation, has shared its experience, expertise a nd knowledge with other countries in various projects and capacity-building programmes in many t hematic areas. This is done in many health fields such as public health; emergencies and disaster med icine; humanitarian assistance, for example setting up a field hospital in Haiti less than 36 hours aft er the earthquake; upgrading water and sanitation quality including the purification of sewage water for use in agriculture and to increase water resources; building public-health capacity and comm unity medicine, and more. All these efforts are consistently undertaken with the primary goal of en suring the Millennium Development Goals are realized in a coordinated manner and according to t he agreed principles of aid effectiveness, country ownership, sustainable development and others. I am also happy to report that the State of Israel has initiated discussions with the WHO on a Memorandum of Understanding with a view to increasi ng Israel's cooperation and contribution to the Organization and its activities. Israel is itself a n example of a country that went through the entire development process from a new and developing count ry to a developed country that has recently joined OECD. Like so many other countries, Israel is coping wit h the world pandemic (H1N1) 2009. In 2009, the State of Israel followed the leadership of the WHO and its Director-General Dr Chan. In light of the possibility of a huge public health disaster, I srael also diverted a large amount of resources for the purchase of Tamiflu\u00ae and flu immunization for its e ntire population, in order to minimize any potential outbreak in the country. At the same time, Israel is of the opinion that, i n the future, a joint front of all Member States, with the leadership of WHO, has the ability to chan ge the medical market of purchasing medications, immunization and other equipment in the face of pot ential world disaster. This in turn, will cause the market of sellers to lower the prices of these comm odities, resulting in much-needed capital for healt h systems to reach the Millennium Development Goals. Israel follows closely the discussions on various agenda items discussed at this session. Such as the new strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcoh ol, food safety, the treatment and prevention of pneumonia, health and migration, and international recruitment of health personnel. And last but not least, Madam Vice-President, Isra el and the Palestinian authority have just launched proximity talks under the stewardship of t he United States of America. Israel considers public health as a real bridge to peace. WHO headqu arters and the European and the Mediterranean regions have the ability to contribute more to the strengthening of important cross-border health A63/VR/3 page 47 cooperation. These contributions are also further n ecessary for the implementation of the Internationa l Health Regulations in the Middle Eastern countries. Focusing on these efforts is more efficient and gl orious than spending time in the Health Assembly on the yearly ritual of condemnation of Is rael which, has never brought any benefit to either side. The steadfast example of cross-border coopera tion, exchange of information and common preparation with our Palestinian neighbours and oth ers that have relations with Israel, as evidenced a t the time of the avian flu and the 2009 flu pandemic , can be extended to other neighbouring countries as well. It is an innovative and successful pattern for cooperation that should complement and support efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East. M.

I now give the floor to the delegate of Pakistan. Mr SHAHABUDDIN (Pakistan): Madam Vice-President, ministers, excellencies, lad ies and gentlemen, at the outset let me congratulate the President of this Health Assembly, the Vice-Presidents and the Chairmen of the Committees on their election. We certainly have a c hallenging agenda in front of us, and several important issues are to be discussed. I am confiden t that under this able leadership, the Health Assembly will certainly be able to achieve its obje ctives. In the past year, implementation of the Internatio nal Health Regulations (2005) has remained a priority in Pakistan and we have adopted various me asures for surveillance and response activities. A63/VR/3 page 48 One achievement is the formulation of a draft Pakis tan Public Health (Surveillance and Response) Act 2010, which addresses all issues related to infecti ous disease hazards, zoonotic events, food safety, chemicals and radiological events. I would like to acknowledge the invaluable assistance of the WHO's legal team in the preparation of our legislat ion. Our flagship National Programme for Family Plannin g and Primary Health Care, with 100 000 lady health workers and 5000 supervisors, which was rece ntly subjected to an external third party evaluation, has shown better results from the cover ed areas relating to the contraceptive prevalence rate, use of modern methods of contraception, at le ast one antenatal visit at a health facility, fully immunized children and births attended by skilled h ealth workers. A real health revolution is in the offing through the outreach services of our lady he alth workers, who are embedded in their catchment communities. Prior to 2007, approximately 1500 kidney transplan ts were performed in Pakistan every year for foreigners who obtained kidneys via remunerated loc al donors. This was a matter of serious concern for the Government of Pakistan. Legislation has bee n adopted to control these commercial transplants and subsequently there is sufficient evidence to su ggest that unethical practices relating to transpla nt tourism have declined significantly. Pakistan remains one of the four countries sufferi ng from endemic poliomyelitis; and in 2010 so far, 19 cases have been confirmed. We are cognizant of the dangers this poses to the nations free of t he virus, as has been highlighted by the outbreak in T ajikistan and the recent related case in Moscow. In the past year, the Prime Minister's action plan for poliomyelitis eradication that my Ministry formulated has broken new ground and expanded the p artnerships for immunization. However, the review commissioned by the Director-General last ye ar has highlighted some regional programmatic weaknesses in our eradication efforts, which we hav e attempted to address by identifying the districts with persistent virus transmission and devising imm unization plans specific to those 15 districts. Are as undergoing law enforcement operations remain a barr ier to high coverage, and with a majority of cases being reported from these areas we resolve to be ag gressive and innovative in improving our access to the under-fives in these reservoirs of poliovirus. A preliminary experience with incentivising high c overage of vaccination has been encouraging, and we hope to extend this regular engagement with the administration of Karachi. My Ministry in the past year has borne the fruits of inlands campaign quality, and we plan to place the spotlight now on the three high-risk districts of Baluchistan in an attempt to catalyse improved performance there. I wish to assure the Health Assembly that political commitment at the highest levels of all the tiers of the Government in Pakistan is robust and will conti nue to be so until the job is finished. Madam President, in conclusion I would like to pla ce on record Pakistan's appreciation of Dr Margaret Chan for her leadership role in global health promotion, and I wish the Sixty-third World Health Assembly a great success in its deliberation s under the President's guidance. Thank you very much indeed. M. TOURE (Mali): Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident je voudrais, \u00e0 mes vi ves au \u00e9lection, ainsi s \u00e9galement Mme le Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Margaret Chan, pour renforcement pour son icitations et remerciements Gouvernement de mon pays, le Mali, pour la bonne co llaboration avec l'OMS.

Sezibera (Rwanda), Vice-Pr\u00e9sident, assume la pr\u00e9sidence. Ms LARSSON (Sweden): Mr Vice-President, ministers and honourable delega tes, I am glad that the Millennium Development Goals are on top of this agenda today. Let me start by thanking WHO and Dr Chan for her strong leadership during the fight against pand emic (H1N1) 2009, an issue that dominated the health agenda in 2009. As this is the first real te st of the International Health Regulations (2005), I look forward to the results from the ongoing review process. I fully agree with what Dr Chan said in her opening speech today: we need to seek lessons a bout how the International Health Regulations (2005) have functioned, about how WHO and the inter national community responded to the pandemic. We need to learn lessons about what worked well and what can be done better. Independent, open and transparent processes are fundamental. On another note, we have for quite some time been facing another major challenge: the rapid increase of antimicrobial resistance. In the autumn of 2009, Sweden held the Presidency of the European Union, and it became clear that all Member States, through Counsel conclusions, were committed to work on the issue nationally. But the Member States also want to bring forward an action plan on how to counteract the problem. This should not, however, be an internal issue to the European Union, but a global one. We can note that there is an increasing awareness about this major health threat but far from enough action. WHO leade rship is urgently needed in this area. There is a strong need to limit excess use of antibiotics, bot h by more restrictive use of our health and medical services and by more effective regulations on marke ting and sales. At the same time there are a number of regions in the world that have no access at all to effective antibiotics. We also need to speed up the development of new medicines with the capacity to replace the antibiotics that no longer work. In Nov ember 2009, the European Union and the United States of America decided to join forces and establ ish a task force on antimicrobial resistance. The matter at hand is so urgent that I encourage all Me mber States to do their utmost to reduce such resistance. And at the same time, I urge WHO to com mit itself to this matter in accordance with the resolution from 2005, and report back on its work t o the Health Assembly, preferably next year. Let me then move to the matter of the future finan cing of WHO. Many of us are deeply concerned with the current financial situation. It is problematic that the governing bodies only have a direct influence over about 20% of the total budget . Over the past decade we have discussed how to come to grips with this situation. At the same time the proportion of earmarked funding has continued to expand. The situation is not sustainable. We are now living with the situation where decisions by the Health Assembly can be implemented only partial ly, and sometimes not at all within a reasonable time frame. Therefore, my Government warmly welcome s the initiative by the Director-General on innovative financial mechanisms. We are prepared to actively engage in your efforts. I want to conclude with some words about the globa l strategy to reduce harmful use of alcohol. We have been through a lengthy and sometimes diffic ult process. I am very pleased that we have hopefully now finally reached the adoption phase. T he outcome of the broad consultations has led to a draft strategy that is both well-balanced and based on best available evidence and practice. It is wel l adapted to the various resources, context and circu mstances at hand in different Member States. An excellent WHO report was recently published called Global health risks . It confirms the great impact of the harmful use of alcohol, the impact especiall y on our children and on families. The report contains an update of the global burden of disease where alcohol ranks number three as a risk factor - closely behind underweight and unsafe sex. So argum ents strongly support the urgent need for us all to agree on and support the implementation of this str ategy. I want to thank all Member States that have jointly and actively embarked on this effort. I am convinced that the global strategy to reduce harmfu l use of alcohol has the potential to become a landma rk in combating alcohol-related health and social harm, and I would like to urge all of us to support WHO's future work.

I congratulate His Excellency, Mr Mondher Zenaidi of Tunisia, on his a ssumption of the Presidency of the Health Assembly. This Health Assembly is indeed of utmost importance as an annual event discussing the global health agenda and recommending policy direct ion, aimed at achieving healthy global communities. It has been 10 years since the United Nations Mill ennium Summit agreed to a 2015 deadline for attaining the Millennium Development Goals. Therefo re, it is timely for us to undertake a review on our achievements and consider ways forward to accel erate attainment of the agreed Goals for those that are lagging behind. Indeed, public health inpu ts constitute the major components of the A63/VR/3 page 54 Millennium Development Goals, namely: nutrition, ma ternal health, child health, water and sanitation and HIV/AIDS and other prevalent communicable disea ses. Furthermore, poverty alleviation and gender mainstreaming are closely linked to public h ealth intervention. I am pleased to note that some Member States have achieved significant progress in attaining the Millennium Development Goal targets. However, w e must also recognize that major and often unforeseen challenges such as political instability and conflict, lack of resources and economic and humanitarian crises have impeded the efforts of som e countries in meeting the Goals. Given that we now only have five years to meet the 2015 deadline, Member States need to reaffirm their commitment and continue in their efforts to reinvig orate and strengthen mutual cooperation and partnerships. In this regard, Indonesia is fully co mmitted to achieving the Millennium Development Goals as scheduled. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoy ono emphasized that the effort to achieve the Goals is a moral obligation, not only for the fulfi lment of international commitment, but also for our national need to increase the welfare of the people . Indonesia, with its disparities in geographic loca tions of about 17 000 islands and level of socioeconomic development, combined with its cultur al and social diversities, is experiencing different levels in the achievement of the Millenni um Development Goals targets as far as comparative analyses between areas are concerned. Decentralized areas, with their diverse resources, have contributed to diverse responses to public health i nterventions, posing serious challenges to attainin g the agreed Goals. Although significant investment has been undertake n by the Government of Indonesia, including the use of international aid, aimed at ac hieving the Goals, there is an urgent need for us t o consider constructive ways to accelerate their achi evement. In this regard, I should recall the statem ent of the Indonesian Vice-President Boediono, at the U nited Nations headquarters last April 2010 that \"Increased and secure funding is essential to incre asing the momentum towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals\". On the other hand, b ased on the analysis in Indonesia, the Government could only fulfil health financing for l ess than 80%. It is therefore pertinent that the le vels of Official Development Assistance from donor count ries remain consistent and in place, as stated by the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moo n. Nevertheless, we should not preclude governance in facing this reality. I urge that inte rnational aid be made effective by synchronising an d synergizing the national policies and strategies. All measures and strategies implemented by the Gov ernment of Indonesia adopt a \"pro-poor\" approach focusing, among others, on maximizing the natural and cultural assets of poor communities and creating an environment in which opportunities to make income can be generated. All stakeholders, including the Government, private sec tor and civil society, should make meaningful contributions to this process and their participati on and cooperation at all levels are required. Allow me to reiterate the principle that \"Health i s an investment, not a cost!\" Clearly it is essential that any health-care system be financiall y viable, but this financial viability should not b e calculated in isolation from the business perspecti ve or from long-term saving strategies. Access to health care allows millions of people to live longe r, healthier and more productive lives, and is a fundamental human right for the people on whose beh alf we speak today. All countries, particularly those that are more economically developed, have a collective responsibility to support and develop the principles of human dignity and equality, both in their own countries and internationally. In this regard, I welcome the result of the Open-E nded Working Group of Member States that has successfully projected the vision of addressing the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework. The final objective of its work is to achieve a fai r, equitable and transparent mechanism that covers both the sharing of biological material as well as the sharing of benefits derived therefrom. I hope t he final agreement will be reached in the near future in order to be able to see the effective work of th e Framework. Finally, I emphasize that through the revitalizati on of our primary health-care services and through health system reforms, we sincerely hope th at our objective of providing equal access to health-care facilities and improving the quality of health of all Indonesians can be met. In turn, the global population will be better off in terms of he alth status. A63/VR/3 page 55 Professor CHUKWU (Nigeria): Mr Vice-President, honourable ministers, delegates , on behalf of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency Dr Goodluck Ebe le Jonathan, I bring you greetings from my country Nigeria and her people. I also wish to use this forum to congratulate the President of the Sixty-third World Health Assembly, Mr Mondher Zenai di, Minister of Health of Tunisia, on his election and wish him success in steering the cours e of this Health Assembly. Mr President, I am sad to inform this Health Assembly of the recent passin g-on of our President, Umaru MusaYar'Adua, who died on Wednesday, 5 May 2010 and has since been bu ried. May his gentle soul rest in perfect peace. Mr Vice-President, kindly allow me to thank and ap preciate the contributions of Dr Margaret Chan the Director-General of WHO, for h er continued promotion of the mandate of this global body, especially the prompt and efficient wa y in which WHO, under her leadership, has risen to the many new emerging global health challenges such as the threat posed by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and climate change challenges to health. The Govern ment of Nigeria also uses this opportunity to commend the other nations of the world for their im mediate and prompt response to these important health challenges and also commiserate with countri es that have directly suffered untold damages, fatality and other attendant consequences. During the Sixty-first and Sixty-second World Heal th Assemblies, several issues were at the heart of the agenda which Nigeria had committed to address, especially eradication of poliomyelitis, maternal and child health, malaria control, pandemi c influenza prevention and control, noncommunicable disease prevention and control, cli mate change and national legislation on health including the National Strategic Health Development Plan, among others. These issues remain very important to Nigeria, and our commitments to contin uously respond to them remain unwavering. As you may be aware Nigeria has made tremendous pr ogress in poliomyelitis eradication since the last Health Assembly, when we were one of only four countries that were yet to interrupt wild poliovirus transmission in the world. As of today, Nigeria has introduced new innovations aimed at improving effectiveness of poliomyelitis eradicatio n activities, utilized the more effective monovalen t and bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine using an integ rated approach, and adopted the Immunization Plus Days. During the Days, a broad range of child survi val interventions are employed, resulting in marked improvement in vaccination coverage and qual ity and a significant decline in the transmission of wild poliovirus, leading to an unqualified endor sement by the Lancet of the progress made by Nigeria. Closely following the poliomyelitis issue is the p roblem of the outbreak of other infectious epidemics in Nigeria in the recent past. We have ef fectively contained these outbreaks and put measures in place to ensure prevention of future ou tbreaks. These include enhancing surveillance activities, providing relevant drugs for case manag ement and thus reducing mortality, strengthening laboratory and diagnostic capacities, and conductin g relevant training of the health workforce. We wish to reassure you and reiterate that Nigeria is fully prepared for the outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 that has affected a large numb er of countries worldwide. We have taken steps such as strengthening national epidemic preparednes s and response, increased collaboration with States and other stakeholders by expanding the Nati onal Epidemic Preparedness and Response Committee to involve States, relevant ministries an d stakeholders. Similar bodies have also been established in all the States and local government areas. Disease surveillance has been strengthened, not only in the health facilities and communities b ut also at all ports of entry into the country. We are also implementing the International Health Regulati ons (2005), of which Nigeria is a signatory. As part of efforts to fulfil our compact with the people and also our commitment to the international community, Nigeria is working hard to be on track for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. While we are on track for health-related Goal 6, we are challenged on Goals 4 and 5. In response to this, we are addre ssing the issues relating to the inadequate health system, resource allocation and human resource gaps as part of efforts to achieve these two Goals. Nigeria is currently implementing the Integrated Ma ternal, Newborn and Child Health Strategy as an integral component of the National Strategic Health Development Plan. The Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has also embarked on a specific unique health intervention called the \"Midwives Service Scheme\" as one of the interventio ns to address Millennium Development Goal 5. A63/VR/3 page 56 As of today, 2488 midwives have been deployed in ov er 650 primary health-care centres in the remotest communities, thus ensuring skilled attenda nce at birth. Diseases related to poor lifestyles are also on th e increase, thereby creating a dual epidemic of communicable and noncommunicable diseases for the c ountry. We have therefore responded by reinvigorating the Non-Communicable Disease Program me to meet national and global targets. Following the health systems strengthening initiati ves, Nigeria is now expanding services in line with the African Union Summit Declaration of 2006. Niger ia is on course to eradicate guinea-worm disease, having reported the last case in November 2008. We will continue working to ensure that we remain guinea-worm free and thus earn WHO certifica tion within the next two years. The Federal Government of Nigeria, recognizing the poor health status of the population and the urgent need to strengthen health systems, has devel oped a National Strategic Health Development Plan through an extensive consultative process involving the States and local governments and other key stakeholders. This Plan provides one plan, one budg et, one results matrix and one monitoring and evaluation framework. Finally, I wish to use this opportunity to once ag ain express appreciation to WHO and all of our development partners in their commitment towards th e success of our efforts. Please do not relent, as we will continue to solicit your support in our eff orts at meeting the global health goals. As we say in Nigeria, it is not over until it is over. God bless you all. Mrs WIDMANN-MAUZ (Germany): Madam Director-General, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to be with you all at the Sixty-third World Health Assemb ly. If we did not have the Millennium Development Goals, we would have to invent them. Al l of the Goals contribute to health, and the German Government is fully committed to supporting our partners in achieving them. The Millennium Development Goals, especially those directly related to health outcomes, have become the international frame of reference for glo bal health. They are concise, measurable and have immense mobilizing power. Merely five years remain until 2015. At this point, we can see that progress on the health-related Goals is mixed: cons iderable progress has been made, but there are stil l substantial challenges. Coherent national Millenniu m Development Goal strategies and efforts are the key to success. This includes enhanced investment a nd capacity building in health systems. Germany believes that robust health systems are cr ucial for achieving all health-related Millennium Development Goals. They will accelerate progress in other Goals such as education and especially poverty reduction. Goal 1 expresses the aim to overcome extreme poverty and hunger. Therefore, it is unacceptable that more than 100 mi llion people are driven into poverty each year because of health-care costs and insufficient healt h protection. Hence, Germany explicitly welcomes the Director-General's decision to focus the forthc oming World health report on the issue of \"financing for universal coverage\". Germany has decided to promote the topic of health systems financing through a high-level ministerial conference in Berlin on 22 and 23 Novem ber of this year. Our conference with the title \"Health System Financing - Key to Universal Coverag e\" will provide a political framework for the high-profile launch of The world health report . It is our goal to move the issue of health system s financing to the top of the global health agenda. W e believe that this focus on health systems strengthening and health systems financing will pro vide a meaningful contribution for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. We inv ite all Member States to participate in this process. Although progress had been made, health systems co ntinue to fail to meet the health-care needs of women at key moments of their lives. With its gl obal report, Women and health: today's evidence tomorrow's agenda , WHO has taken stock of the worldwide health situa tion of women across their life-course. The evidence it contains is compelling , and the agenda for action it proposes is one that should engage us all. The fact that widespread ineq uities in the health of women and girls persist is unacceptable when we know what needs to be done. Strategies to improve women's health must be based on improving gender equality and women's empowerment - Millennium Development Goal 3 promotes gender equality and empowers A63/VR/3 page 57 women - is vital for the achievement of all Goals. We call upon all stakeholders to reaffirm the globa l commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and to develop coherent strategies to accelerate progress. Ladies and gentlemen, this Health Assembly truly h as a very full agenda this year. We will be working on issues vital to global health. Some of t hese will need considerable discussion and profound deliberation. These include the exchange of viruses with pandemic potential, the International Health Regulations (2005) review, counterfeit medicines an d the draft Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel. Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, be assure d of the support of Germany in all these efforts. M.

I am confident that under your stewardship, you will guide the work of this a ugust Health Assembly to a successful conclusion. I would also like to extend my delegation's apprec iation to the Director-General, Dr Chan, for her opening remarks. You have raised issues which a re central to our work here. Ten years have elapsed since the United Nations General Assembly u nanimously endorsed the Millennium Declaration. Since then, as reported by the WHO Sec retariat, globally, fewer children are dying; fewer children are underweight; more women get skilled he lp during childbirth; fewer people are contracting HIV/AIDS; tuberculosis treatment is more successful ; and more people have access to safe drinking- water. There has been significant progress in this respect in some countries, while in others, progres s has been limited because of conflict, poor governan ce, economic or humanitarian crises and lack of resources. Despite the decreasing trends in the total annual number of deaths among children under five and the availability of financial and technical aid , millions of children still die from lack of healt h care every year. Hundreds of thousands of women continue to die in pregnancy and childbirth each year, despite having access to family planning services a nd increases in the rate of attended deliveries. Th e maternal mortality health indicator shows the wides t gaps between the rich and poor, both between and within countries. With regard to efforts to com bat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, despite relative success in selected countries, there is st ill slow progress in halting the global pandemic of HIV/AIDS. Efforts made to close the gaps through th e sharing of information, discussions on progress, major challenges that remain, lessons lea rnt from successes and failures and the strategies for the way forward to achieve the Millennium Developme nt Goals are very much welcome. Crucial, unending and sustained collaborative efforts need t o be extended, and technical help by WHO, other United Nations agencies and other interested partie s is invaluable in assisting countries. Brunei Darussalam is strongly committed to achievi ng the target set in the Millennium Development Goals. Brunei Darussalam has been class ified as an early achiever in meeting the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Improvement i n these indicators is a result of rising standards of accessible health services, a higher s tandard of living with improved hygiene and sanitation, improved levels of education and increa sing empowerment of women. For a country that has attained most of the health -related Millennium Development Goals, the challenge before Brunei Darussalam is to maintain a nd improve our achievements, in particular by reducing neonatal deaths; and to maintain low level s of maternal mortality ratios by ensuring continued access to quality antenatal and postnatal care. Maternal and child health services in Brunei Darus salam have also contributed significantly to the reduction in child mortality. A well-establishe d, free comprehensive National Childhood Immunization Programme has been successful in prote cting children against vaccine-preventable diseases. Immunization coverage in Brunei Darussala m has consistently remained above 95% for all vaccines in the Programme, thus meeting the target set by WHO. The incidence of HIV/AIDS in Brunei Darussalam rem ains at a low level. By the end of 2009, there were altogether 34 people living with HIV in Brunei Darussalam, all of whom had access to equitable care and free antiretroviral treatment. S ince 2005, no cases of mother-to-child transmission have been recorded, and at present there are no chi ldren living with HIV in Brunei Darussalam. A63/VR/3 page 61 Serosurveillance for HIV is currently incorporated in all antenatal screening, blood donors, frequent blood recipients, all tuberculosis and sexually tra nsmitted-illness patients, prisoners and selected p re- employment screening. Brunei Darussalam's full commitment to combating t uberculosis is clearly reflected through the continuous availability of resources for the manage ment of the disease. These include ensuring a free and uninterrupted supply of drugs and vaccines as w ell as strengthening existing capacity and capability in tuberculosis management, including di agnostic services as well as training of health and medical personnel. The National TB Prevention Control Programme estab lished in March 2000 undertakes contact tracing as well as the directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) and has achieved 100% DOTS coverage in the past five years. Notification of al l forms of tuberculosis has shown a steady declinin g trend consistent with the report of other parameter s in the Programme, including high cure rates, high success rates, no treatment failures, negligible de faulters, and no multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. We realize that the Millennium Development Goals a re subject to many new and evolving challenges such as globalization, escalating health -care costs, natural disasters, complex emergencies , ageing population, urbanization and changing socioe conomic and cultural values, to name a few. We are also increasingly faced with the challenge of c ombating noncommunicable disease groups, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellit us. In addressing these challenges, we are indeed inde bted to the technical support of WHO, offered through collaboration of various forums in the regi on. This has significantly assisted our efforts to strengthen our capacity and capability to address t he many challenges. The pivotal role played by regional and international cooperation, which has l ed to many achievements thus far, therefore needs to be further enhanced. The issues of the borderless world of health econo mics and the sociopolitical sphere have posed greater challenges to us all. The situation is even worse now with the global food, energy, financial and economic crisis as well as increasing environme ntal hazards. The cross-cutting nature of the issue s required us to work in tandem with all our stakehol ders beyond the health sector. Multi-sector involvement, including public-private partnerships needs to be established, together with strengthened community participation, empowerment and ownership in many health activities. With the present financial crisis, however, the re source gap is growing. In addition, the burden posed by natural disasters has in some way delayed, and in some countries halted, progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals. Secondary to this, it has in turn directly and indirectly affected human health and put vulnerable population s at greater risk. Availability of the trained human resources requir ed to adequately run services to enable accessibility in particular to services related to the Millennium Development Goals is also a real challenge. In this regard, innovative ways where no n-traditional human resources may be utilized to fill the gap without compromising standards need to be thought of according to each country's individual set-up. Lastly but not least, as we all know, the United N ations Summit on the Millennium Development Goals is going to be held in September 2010, let us here work together to address the problems in achieving the targets of the Goals. Str onger and sustained international action is needed to accelerate implementation within the next five year s. Unless existing barriers are addressed, achievin g the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 will be ve ry challenging and may be unattainable for some countries. Dr RISIKKO (Finland): Honourable Director-General, Mr Vice-President, di stinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to address this Health Assembly on behalf of the Government of Finland. We fully associate ourselves with the E uropean Union statement. Finland is looking forward to WHO's continued and strengthened global leadership and guidance on strengthening health systems. Accessibl e, good-quality and an equitable health services with an adequately trained sustainable workforce ar e key factors in improving health. To ensure universal access and care, we may have to tailor se rvices to meet the needs of specific population A63/VR/3 page 62 groups. The need for well-functioning and accessibl e health services has been apparent in, for example, examining the progress on health-related M illennium Development Goals, such as maternal health. The importance of preventing noncommunicable disea ses cannot be overstated. Last week's decision by the United Nations General Assembly to have a high-level meeting on noncommunicable diseases in September 2011 highlights this. We are delighted about this decision. The decision also calls for further leadership by WHO. Finland warmly welcomes the alcohol strategy as we ll as the noncommunicable disease strategy progress report, including its annex. We look forwa rd to their implementation, as well as monitoring and evaluation of their effectiveness. At national level, Finland recently implemented se veral measures to prevent noncommunicable diseases. The Government has established an interse ctoral policy programme on health promotion, and the Ministry of Health issued an intersectoral plan of action to reduce health inequalities. We have a comprehensive tobacco policy, with recent additiona l measures. As regards alcohol, our current Government has increased taxes on alcohol on public health grounds. We are also considering taxes on sugar-containing beverages and sweets. Other measur es, such as possible incentives for industry to produce healthy food, are being discussed. Health e ducation, through schools, media and in health services is crucial. We would like to congratulate WHO and Kenya for th e excellent Global Conference on Health Promotion held last autumn. We would also like to i nform you that Finland has preliminarily agreed to hold the next Global Conference in Helsinki in 2013 . Last but not least, I want to express my sincere thanks to you, Director-General, for the guidance a nd leadership provided by WHO during the pandemic influenza. We count on your continuing sup port in this area. Mr Vice-President, I am looking forward to the del iberations in this Health Assembly. Thank you for your attention. The PRESIDENT: We have had a very long and productive day and it is time for us to adjourn the meeting. The meeting rose at 19:10. La s\u00e9ance est lev\u00e9e \u00e0 19h10. A63/VR/4 page 63 FOURTH PLENARY MEETING Tuesday, 18 May 2010, at 09:05 President: Mr Mondher du point 3 de Avant de po ursuivre, je d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s pourront pas point de l'ordre du jour avant leur d\u00e9part ; ils peuvent sont d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la Tanzanie. Je les invi te \u00e0 venir \u00e0 la tribune. Je donne la parole au d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de R pa au d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la R\u00e9publique-Unie de Tanzanie qui s'exprimera au nom des pays de Comm unaut\u00e9 de d\u00e9veloppement de l'Afrique australe. Professor MWAKYUSA (United Republic of Tanzania): On behalf of the Member States of the Southern Afr ican Development Community, or SADC, I am honoured to be able to provide a statement to th e Sixty-third World Health Assembly. The SADC region has an estimated combined population of 200 million people distributed among the 15 Member States, with health indicators below the expected s tandards in terms of infant mortality rates, child mortality rates and maternal mortality rates. Commu nicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other emerging epidemics, includin g multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, are still responsible for high morbidity and mortality in the region, which is also experiencing an increase in lifestyle diseases in the form of such noncommunica ble diseases as heart ailments, hypertension, cancer, injury and trauma. The SADC Member States face high levels of materna l, perinatal and child mortality. We are aware that not all countries in the SADC region wil l be able to meet Millennium Development Goals G, 5 and 6. The region will, however, be able to meet the malaria targets if the current level o f support is scaled up, maintained and sustained. We also recognize that to meet the Millennium Development Goals, particularly Goal 5, more resour ces and increased efforts will be required from other sectors and stakeholders. In addition, countr ies will be required to report progress on these Go als in 2011. We therefore call on WHO to work with the region and countries to scale up implementation and reporting mechanisms. Due to the challenges to which I have referred, th e region has identified health as one of the most important priority areas in its regional coope ration and deeper integration and development agenda. It has been widely acknowledged that access to quality health care is not only central to the ultimate goal of poverty eradication - improvement of the standard and quality of life of the people o f the region - but also a critical factor in accelera ted and sustainable economic development. It is ind eed sad to note that on an annual basis more than 13 mi llion cases of malaria are reported in the SADC region alone. In some Member States, up to G0% of t he population suffer from malaria at a given point during the year. For this reason, the SADC region h as welcomed the recent decisions to allow the use of DDT for malaria control and possible eradication . We also welcome the support received from the Roll Back Malaria Partnership in assisting SADC Mem ber States to implement the Road Map in order to meet the 2010 targets. As a region, our fundamental goal is to build stro ng health systems that are based on the foundations of equity, good governance and justice. In pursuit of our goals, we are fully aware that there will be no easy victory and that there will b e many obstacles along our path. In view of this fa ct, the SADC region remains committed to its vision and practical implementation because, for us, access to health care is above all a human right. Regarding elimination of paediatric HIV, as a regi on, we strongly believe we should invest together with our partners in interventions that ar e working, that are cost-effective, and that are be ing used to strengthen maternal, newborn and child heal th systems. I refer to prevention of mother-to-chil d transmission of HIV, where we have made tremendous strides as a region; we want to add our call to an emphatic and resolute decision to work to elimin ate paediatric HIV. One of the major concerns in the region is the hig h prevalence of tuberculosis which continued to contribute to avoidable morbidity and mortality. We have noted with concern that, as a region most affected by tuberculosis, we have not benefited fai rly from the global initiatives that are intended t o A63/VR/4 page 66 support the most tuberculosis-affected communities. For instance, while seven out of 10 countries in the world with the highest per capita tuberculosis cases are in southern Africa, the majority of them have not benefited from global initiatives that are enjoyed by other high-burden countries. We would like to call on the Health Assembly to revise its c riteria for high tuberculosis-burden countries, so that countries such as Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Sw aziland, with high per capita tuberculosis, could be prioritized on initiatives such as tuberculosis prevalence surveys. The other challenge that the SADC region is facing is the emergence of resistance to first-line antiretroviral medicines. It is worth mentioning th at patents on newly developed essential medicines have exacerbated already constrained resources and limited access to essential medicines. Close to 50% of the population in the SADC region lack regul ar access to newly developed affordable, quality, safe and efficacious essential medicines. To addres s this, Member States in the SADC region profoundly express their political will and commitm ent to improve pharmaceutical programmes in their countries. In addition, the SADC region has e mbarked on and is prioritizing regional production of essential medicines for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis a nd malaria, based on the African Union Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for Africa. We, t herefore, as a region, call on WHO to first, support SADC Member States and the region in streng thening their regulatory mechanisms; and second, to provide the necessary assistance and inf ormation to the SADC countries with a view to facilitating speedy prequalification of products by WHO. The SADC region is also addressing the issue of mi gration of health workers to industrialized countries, particularly highly trained and skilled health personnel moving from the SADC region to developed countries. To address the situation, SADC health ministers have resolved to improve the conditions of service of their staff and use of bil ateral agreements between and among the SADC Member States to address the human resources challe nge. We therefore welcome the draft global code of practice on the international recruitment of hea lth personnel, which we believe will go a long way towards addressing the uncontrolled migration of he alth workers. The SADC region has now adopted a new approach in addressing public health issues for combating noncommunicable diseases, in line with th e principles of the Declaration of Alma-Ata. It is also gratifying to note that SADC was the first reg ion to launch and subsequently commemorate the Healthy Lifestyles Day on the last Friday of Februa ry each year. We are advocating a shift from ill health to health, and as we continue to implement t his decision, we will encourage the people of our region - young and old alike - to be more physicall y active and eat healthy foods, thus reducing lifestyle diseases. The SADC region recognizes the threat posed by eme rging epidemics such as pandemic (H1N1) 2009. The spectators will certainly bring the virus to South Africa, as the African continent, through the SADC region, will be hosting the 2010 FIFA Worl d Cup in the next few days in South Africa. This event will bring large numbers of soccer teams and soccer fans to our region. We however, remain firm and vigilant and prepared for any outbr eaks like H1N1 that may erupt. This is in addition to our resolve to continue the fight against such e pidemics and pandemics. The future of the SADC region, that is the unborn babies, children and our mothers, is under threat due to rampant trafficking and internal and external immigration. This vulnerable group of our region is in danger due to forced and unforced migr ation on economic, geographical and ethical grounds. Interventions are required that address ro ot causes of vulnerability of children and the yout h within a context defined by HIV/AIDS, poverty, igno rance and hunger. SADC commits itself to safeguarding their rights to access social commodit ies and facilities to sustain their lives. Let me conclude, Mr President, by thanking the WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, for her stewardship and vision for WHO. In addition, my colleagues in the SADC region and I would like to reiterate our commitment to work alongside Dr Sa mbo, WHO Regional Director for Africa, to improve the lives of the people of our region. I th ank you. Ms TEODORO JORGE (Portugal): Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would begin by highlighting that Portugal is a long- standing advocate of the health determinants approa ch, both at the international and national levels. As an active participant in Alma-Ata, Portugal made pr imary health care the cornerstone of the A63/VR/4 page 67 Portuguese Health System created in 1978. The very existence of the National Health System guided by the principles of universal coverage, equity and solidarity, is itself a landmark of Portuguese democracy. Thirty years later, the citizen's rights -centred approach has allowed for steady progress i n pursuit of \"More Health for all\". Health is indeed a right for all: for men and women, for rich and poor, for all human beings regardless of their stat us. On the ongoing reform of primary health care, Portugal has met and even exceeded set targets. Yes terday, however, we all heard Dr Chan and I quote: \"National average is not enough\". National a verage results do not reflect the needs of the poor and social minorities, and I quote again Dr Chan: \" If we miss the poor we miss the point\". We should be aware that a correct reading of health is very m uch cross-cutting. It also includes education, good housing, water and sanitation, gender equality, acc ess to health care and affordable medicines. At the crossroads of an economic and financial cri sis, the challenge is to achieve our goals with better use of existing resources. This need is acce ntuated by the expenditure on health being driven b y an ageing population, chronic disease and complex t echnologies. Two months ago, European Union health ministers met to debate the critical issue o f equity in health. It has been decided to take the necessary steps to develop comparable indicators an d improve methodologies to monitor and control health inequalities. However, the health sector can not go it alone. There is a need to develop cross- sector policies. This calls for a shift from the tr aditional approach to health problems to one that addresses the social determinants as root causes of poor health. This was already been perceived by the visionary leaders in Alma-Ata, thirty years ago . At the national level, Portugal's health strategie s represent a commitment to a highly participatory process, with an increasingly bottom- up approach to strategic management by the various layers of the health system, and an intermi nisterial committee to foster intersectoral action. Benefiting from close cooperation with the WHO Regi onal Office for Europe, the strategy was evaluated by leading external experts. The new Heal th Strategy 2011-2016 chose four cross-cutting themes: citizenship in a perspective of participati on and empowerment; healthy public policies following an approach to Health-in-All-Policies; eq uity and access to health care focusing on primary health care; and quality in terms of both structure s and processes. Finally, I would underline that Portugal co-hosted with Spain a side event to the Health Assembly, following on the Global Consultation on M igrant Health. It is Portugal's firm belief that migrant health is crucial to the promotion of healt h equity and inclusive societies. Portugal consider s that the international community should follow up t he recommendations of the Sixty-first World Health Assembly on migrant health, towards a greate r contribution to the promotion of Health for All. In a time of economic and social crisis, migrants a re among the more vulnerable groups. Despite growing awareness, policies do not suffici ently address existing health inequities. And health can and should play an important role in avo iding social exclusion. There is much work ahead. The challenges before us demand continuous and conc erted action - action to be driven by all, together. Thank you, Mr President. La Dra. ITURRIA y compa\u00f1eros trabajadores por y se to dos.

I consider all this progress also very promising. Furthermore, we have come a long way towards achiev ing the Millennium Development Goals. Indeed, a number of countries have already reached most of their targets. Yet inequalities between countries still exist. And there are some who say t hat many developing countries will not be able to accomplish the Millennium Development Goals. There is a clear need for sufficient financial resources and infrastructures to achieve the said Goals and e nsure their sustainability. Moreover, equity should be embraced as a fundamental human right. A63/VR/4 page 69 As we work to the best of our capacities, I wish t o emphasize the importance of solidarity and cooperation. One country's sole success shall not b e enough unless the Millennium Development Goals are achieved globally. In this context, the c ountries that reach the targets are not free from responsibility. That is why, under WHO's leadership , we should reinforce and further improve our collaboration. We should share our experiences and best practices. Turkey has always been ready for such cooperation and exchange of experience. We bel ieve that working together is the only way to come to the end of this long and difficult road. I would like to share briefly two examples of our most significant achievements in Turkey related to the Millennium Development Goals. Let me say that, as a paediatrician, this success is particularly important for me. We have witnessed in Turkey a remarkable decrease in both maternal and child mortality by our health transformation pr ogramme. We have made special efforts to improve the situation. Over the last 10 years the maternal mortality rate has decreased from 70 to 20 per 100 000, while the infant mortality rate has fallen from G3 to 13 per 1000. We expect to reduce the maternal mortality rate to below 15, and the infant mortality rate to below 10 in 2010. The last two years so far have seen intense effort s in the field of health. Along with the financial crisis, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has been a major chall enge for many countries. As you know, cooperation, transparency and rapid communication a re crucial to effectively combat any pandemic. Having said that, I would like to thank Madam Direc tor-General, her team and WHO for their determined and strong management during the pandemi c. This pandemic has also shown us the importance of preparedness and rapid action, and gi ven us an opportunity to see what we should do further. Let me underline that the key point here is acting together. During the recent pandemic, we unfortunately observed that some countries could no t access the vaccine while the others spent large amounts. The availability of any pandemic vaccine i s so crucial that it should not be left up to marke t dynamics. Taking account of recent experiences, WHO should play a more proactive role. For example, a global fund could be established, whereb y WHO could manage the production process and ensure fair distribution. I would like to express my condolences to the trag edy-stricken countries and people who suffered from earthquakes in the last couple of mon ths. Turkey, unfortunately, has witnessed a number of dramatic disasters, especially earthquakes in he r history. Natural disasters are priority items on the agenda of every country. In this regard, vigilance, preparedness, early and timely response are essential factors for each country. Not only at cou ntry level, but also internationally, we should hav e efficient, effective and sufficiently rapid operati onal mechanisms to further develop response capacities. For instance, our well-trained medical rescue teams aided rescue efforts in many countries such as Haiti, Indonesia, Iran and Pakistan. During these experiences, we recognized that challenges such as communication failures, formalities and org anizational weaknesses are usually a hindrance. Therefore, WHO should establish an operational glob al emergency response mechanism. I would also like to draw the Health Assembly's at tention to the people living in the occupied territories, including the Gaza Strip, where diffic ulties persist, even for addressing the most essent ial health services. I believe that taking a more activ e role in this matter is necessary for WHO in order to meet the needs of such people, taking into account the principle of \"Health for All\". We all aim to ensure a better world for our childr en, and know that solidarity and cooperation are always important for us. Thank you. M. BIANCHERI (Monaco): Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, cons\u00e9quence de fragiliser encore davantage les conditions de vie d es populations les plus vuln\u00e9rables.

Le Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et en possession au moment o\u00f9 futur, en particulier dans le domaine de communication, des QUOC TRIEU (Viet Nam) ( Interpretation from the Vietnamese) :1 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of t he Vietnamese delegation, I would like to express gratitude to WHO for having invited Viet Na m to this Health Assembly and for having given our country precious support in the area of public health. Within the context of the Millennium Development Goals, Viet Nam has reaffirmed its resp ect for the values and principles of the United Nations Millennium Declaration, which was made by 1 89 Heads of State and Government at the 1 In accordance with Rule 89 of the Rules of Procedu re of the World Health Assembly. A63/VR/4 page 71 Millennium Summit convened at United Nations Headqu arters in September 2000. We are accelerating our implementation and have achieved e ncouraging results as regards the eight Goals, three of which are in the area of health. Viet Nam has achieved almost all of them in the period 2006- 2010. With regard to Millennium Development Goal G, infa nt mortality, in 2009 the level for children under five was 25/1000. The figure for children und er one was 15/1000. The level of malnutrition among children under one was 18.9%. We have also re ceived great support from the GAVI Alliance. With regard to Millennium Development Goal 5, in 20 09 the maternal mortality rate fell to 75/100 000. The level of women benefiting from thre e consultations during their pregnancy was 8G.6%; the level of births attended by obstetrician s was 9G.8%. With regard to Goal 6, namely malaria, HIV/AIDS and other epidemics, we have achieved grea t success, as the level of infection is below 0.3% in the population. Furthermore, we have managed to do a great deal. W e have been implementing the Millennium Development Goals. Viet Nam is a country that is de veloping. It has a long path ahead of it, with many obstacles in the area of health. It has a sign ificant divide with regard to access to medical services between regions and social groups. There a re shortcomings and different levels in the provision of medical equipment, which means that th ere are still many challenges ahead. The Vietnamese Government has agreed to ensure that all social classes should be supported in their access to health care. In addition, we call for further su pport from donors and United Nations bodies in orde r to accelerate the Millennium Development Goals. Professor MYA OO (Myanmar): 1 Mr President, Director-General, excellencies, ladi es and gentlemen Myanmar is one of the developing countries of the WHO South-East Asia Reg ion and is also a member of ASEAN. It has a population of over 58 million, 70% of which reside in rural areas. Myanmar, like all other developing countries of th e Region, is experiencing a double burden of disease with communicable diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and new emerging diseases like H5N1 and the current human influenza pandemic due to the new pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus on the one hand, and noncommuni cable diseases such as heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, cancer, substance a buse, and traffic accidents on the other hand. In addition, maternal newborn and childhood health inc luding malnutrition are also national health priorities. Myanmar, as a member of the United Nations family, is committed to attaining the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2015 by str engthening its health system to provide essential health care to all people in general and meet the health needs of the poor, women, children and other vulnerable groups in particular. Poverty is the world's most ruthless killer and th e greatest cause of human suffering. It is one of the major challenges of the country particularly in remote and border areas. The Government launched a multisectoral border area development plan in 198 9 to meet the basic needs of nationalities residing in remote and border areas. The Ministry for the Pr ogress of Border Areas and National Races and Development has taken on responsibility of implemen ting the plan in collaboration with the other ministries concerned. Priority has been given to th e development of transport and communication, health, education, agriculture and livestock breedi ng in 68 townships of 7 states and 2 divisions, wit h 5 million people of national races residing in the area. The Government also launched an integrated Rural D evelopment Plan which includes a five- point agenda to meet Millennium Development Goals, namely: the construction of roads, linking village to village and village to urban township, a nd district to district; the provision of safe drin king- water and sanitation as well as water for cultivati on; education; the provision of essential health services and a referral system to station and towns hip hospitals; and promotion of agriculture and livestock breeding for income generation. 1 The following is the full text of the speech deliv ered by Professor Mya Oo in shortened form. A63/VR/4 page 72 The 2001 household income and expenditure survey f ound that the estimated poverty rate was 20% in urban areas, 28% in rural areas and 26% for the country as a whole. The poverty gap ratio was 6.8%. We fully recognize that investment in health will lead to poverty reduction and economic development. Malnutrition is recognized as an outco me as well as a cause of poverty. Nutrition plays a major role in the survival, growth and development of young children, and malnutrition also contributes to 50%-60% of child deaths in developin g countries. Protein energy malnutrition, iodine deficiency disorders, iron and folic acid deficienc y anaemia are major nutritional problems similar to those of many developing countries. Mothers and chi ldren are the most vulnerable to undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies especially in rural and peri-urban areas. There has been significant progress with regard to iodine deficiency due to un iversal iodization of salt, with household consumption of iodized salt increasing from 10.8% i n 199G to 86% in 2005. During the same period, goitre prevalence dropped from 33% to 2% in 2006. S trong political commitment, effective cooperation of relevant Government ministries, priv ate salt producers, support from UNICEF, and many others contribute to the progress of Myanmar's programme for universal salt iodization. A recent survey indicated that 50% of pregnant wom en and 25% of adolescent girls are anaemic; we are implementing behavioural change com munication as regard to food habits and health- seeking behaviour, and also iron folic acid and vit amin B1 supplementation. Vitamin A supplementation was initiated during the years 2000 through to 2002 together with vaccination against poliomyelitis on the national immunization days and through Nutrition Promotion Week campaigns started in 2003 up till now. Today blindness due to vitamin A deficiency is almost unknown in Myanmar. There was a gradual decline in the prevalence of p rotein-energy-malnutrition among children under five from 38.6% in 1997 to 36.3% in 2000 and 31.8% in 2003. But these current prevalence rates are still high, and at the same time 32.2% of children are stunted and 8.6% are wasted. Undernutrition is more common among rural children than their urban counterparts. Nutrition rehabilitation and supplementary feeding for malnou rished children are being implemented in both rural and urban areas with joint collaboration betw een local and international nongovernmental organizations and community participation for susta inability. The 2003 National Body Mass Index survey indicated that 20% of women were underweight with a BMI of less than 18.5. The false beliefs of women in some traditional communities stop them from eating a variety of nutritious foods during the critical period of pregnancy and lactation. Hou sehold food security is the most critical factor in malnutrition. As women and children make up 60% of the populatio n, the Government of Myanmar is strengthening its health system to enhance the heal th status of all people in general and the health needs of the women, newborns, children, the poor an d the other vulnerable groups in particular. I would like to point out that 13 developing countrie s account for 70% of global maternal deaths and five countries in Asia and the Pacific region are r esponsible for 50% of global maternal deaths. According to a United Nations estimate in 2003, the maternal mortality ratio was 380 per 100 000 live births in Myanmar, which is still high in the Regio n. About 60% to 80% of maternal deaths are due to postpartum haemorrhage, sepsis, obstructed labour, hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and septic abortion. The South East-Asia Region carries a proportional burden of morbidity and mortality amongst children under five. The under-five mortality rate is 66 per 1000 live births in Myanmar. Although thi s rate has declined significantly in past decades, th e infant mortality rate of G9.7 per 1000 live birth s has not changed significantly: over 80% of under-five m ortality occurs in rural areas, and 73% of deaths occur before the first birthday. Moreover, two thir ds of neonatal deaths occurred within the first wee k of life, and two thirds of these deaths take place in the first 2G hours of life. Therefore, attention to neonatal survival is imperative for achieving the t argeted reduction of the infant mortality rate and the under-five mortality rate, especially in rural area s. The availability of skilled attendants at every pregnancy and childbirth is crucial for improving a ccess to maternal and newborn care services. The proportion of births attended by skilled persons in creased from 57% in 2001 to 67.5% in 2003. Improving the health of mothers and newborns requir es a continuum of good-quality reproductive health care, starting from the period before pregna ncy to some months after delivery. Also recognized is the need for a better functioning referral syste m for emergency obstetric care and care for newborn s A63/VR/4 page 73 with problems. We are striving to achieve universal access to reproductive health by the year 2015 so as to reach the Millennium Development Goal targets for maternal and neonatal mortality. Regarding the under-five mortality rate, the major killers ar e pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, measles and HIV/AIDS, with malnutrition contributing to more th an 50% of all deaths. For these, there are already cost-effective health interventions. The major chal lenges are due to lack of resources in developing countries; it is noted that the Millennium Developm ent Goals monitoring framework includes a new target \"Achieve, by 2015, universal access to repro ductive health\" under Millennium Development Goal 5, which recognizes the centrality of reproduc tive health services and reproductive health rights in improving maternal newborn and child-health and reducing poverty. To ensure successful implementation of the reprodu ctive health strategy it is also necessary, to address poverty-related health issues including mal nutrition, lack of safe drinking-water and sanitation, and a low level of exclusive breastfeed ing and skilled birth attendance. International stakeholders should provide adequate technical and financial support to resource-limited developing countries and the developing countries should also scale up their investment in health, as recommended by the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health. Health professionals also need to redouble their efforts; and only then will we be ab le to achieve the targets of health-related Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Based on evidence and lessons learnt from previous strategies and interventions, we have formulated a Five-year Strategic Plan for Child Hea lth (2010-201G), with technical inputs from main stakeholders. It has been implemented in close coop eration and collaboration with the Five-year Strategic Plan for Reproductive Health (2009-2013) and the Five-year Strategic Plan for Adolescents (2008-2011). These three strategic plans have commo nality of strategic directions and approaches. To achieve Millennium Development Goals G and 5 by 2015, we need to ensure the continuum of maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition in a sustainable manner. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to effectively coordinate and collaborat e among stakeholders such as the Government, WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and other United Nations organiz ations, international nongovernmental organizations as well as private-sector national no ngovernmental organizations and the communities themselves, for human, technical and financial reso urces. Malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS are national pr iority diseases hindering the socioeconomic development of the country. We are combating these three diseases in accordance with national programmes, with a high level of political commitme nt. Over 70% of the population reside in malarious areas. During the last two decades, malar ia morbidity and mortality have been declining. In the 1990s the morbidity rate was 2G.5 per 1000 popu lation, and the mortality rate was 10.G per 100 000 live births. At present, morbidity and mort ality have been reduced to 10.7 per 1000 population and 1.8 per 100 000 live births, respect ively. Human behaviour in using insecticide-treated bednets, an adequate supply of rapid diagnosis test s and artemisinin-based combination therapy are key factors in reducing the malaria morbidity and m ortality. Human resource training and supportive supervision are also crucial for malaria programmes . Tuberculosis is also a major public health problem and Myanmar is one of 22 high tuberculosis burden and 27 high multidrug-resistant tuberculosis countries in the world. Recent estimates suggest that 1.5% of the population becomes infected with t uberculosis ever year, and that some 130 000 people go on to develop tuberculosis. Half of these cases are infectious with positive sputum smears. The national tuberculosis programme began implement ing a directly observed treatment, short course strategy in 1997, and all townships in the country were covered by the year 2003. We have formulated a revised national strategic plan for 2010-2015, wh ich includes six principal components of the new WHO's Stop TB strategy. We achieved a case detectio n rate of 9G% and a treatment success rate of 85% in 2008. The uninterrupted supply of good-quali ty first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs supported by the Global Drug Facility was completed in 2009, but fortunately will be backed in 2010 with support from the Three Diseases Fund and Japanese Grant Aid . South-East Asia has the second highest HIV/AIDS di sease burden and the epidemic is still concentrated in the population with high-risk behav iour, such as commercial sex workers and injecting drug users. Considerable progress has been made in fighting this epidemic by implementing a national plan with full involvement of various Government ag encies, the private sector and nongovernmental organizations. HIV prevalence in Myanmar started to decline from 0.9G% in the year 2000, falling to A63/VR/4 page 7G 0.67% in 2007 and to 0.61% in 2009. But prevalence in high-risk groups such as commercial female sex workers and injecting drug users remains high, ranging from 20% to 38% in 2008. Success in reducing prevalence is the result of firm political commitment and the scaling-up of coordinated efforts of all stakeholders. However, the 2003 targ et of antiretroviral treatment reaching at least ha lf of those in need of therapy has not been met and only one in five receives treatment. We are confident that with the Three Diseases Fund and additional su pport from the Global Fund, the goals and targets of Millennium Development Goal 6 will be achieved i n 2015. Essential medicines are vital tools for the health care system. The primary objective is to ensure safe and good-quality essential medicines at an aff ordable price. The proportion of the population wit h access to affordable medicines is about 60%. Due to the TRIPS agreement, the developing countries cannot afford the prices of patent-protected drugs. The Commission on Macroeconomics and Health recommended broader licensing to produce high-quali ty generic drugs for use on the domestic markets of low-income countries. This means that the rich c ountries would bear the cost of research and development while the poor countries would pay a pr ice close to the production cost. I would like to urge the multinational pharmaceutical industry, WHO , WTO and the low-income countries to work together to ensure that the poor countries can acce ss medicines at the lowest viable commercial price. I have presented progress and achievements with re gard to the health-related Millennium Development Goals in Myanmar. However, we fully rec ognize the need to sustain political momentum and scale up investment in health. It is a lso crucial for the international community and financial organizations to sustain their commitment to assist low-income countries, without which the latter will not be able to achieve the Millennium D evelopment Goals and targets by 2015. Myanmar is also building a stronger health system so as to ens ure comprehensive, good-quality health-care services for all people and protection against fina ncial disaster, especially for poor people during illness, covering reproductive health services as w ell. At this juncture, I would like to commend the effo rts of WHO to work with the GAVI Alliance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Mal aria, and the World Bank in developing a common platform for health systems funding in line with the recommendation of the High-level Task Force on Innovative International Financing for Hea lth Systems. We are also strengthening health information systems in collaboration with WHO to en hance the availability of quality health data, especially on the health-related Millennium Develop ment Goals and other indicators. I would like to express my profound gratitude and appreciation to WHO, other United Nations agencies, international communities and internation al financial organizations, and all respective stakeholders for their assistance to the Union of M yanmar. We also support the Secretariat's report on monitoring of the achievements of the health-relate d Millennium Development Goals, and the Executive Board resolution EB126.RG. Finally, I wou ld like to reiterate our commitment to achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals by the year 2015. Thank you for your kind attention. Mr JEON Jae-hee (Republic of Korea): Mr President, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour to speak today on behalf of the Republic of Korea. I remember standing here at the Sixty-second World Health Assembly last year, talking about solidarity in the fight against pandemic (H1N1) 200 9. I am pleased to tell you that Korea has successfully kept the pandemic under control, like many other countries. This year, we are gathered to discuss yet another challenge for health ministers and professionals that requires our urgent attentio n: the health-related Millennium Development Goals. I wish to express my appreciation to Dr Chan and WHO for the timely decision to bring this pressing issue to our attention. It should sound an alarm fo r us all that, among all the Millennium Development G oals, the least progress has been made in achieving maternal and infant mortality reduction. Health-related goals cannot be met with the efforts of the foreign affairs ministries or organizations in charge of official development assistance alone. It will not be possible without a strong commitment of health leaders and expertise of health professionals. Recognizing their indispensable role in the drive to achieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals, United Nations Secret ary-General Ban Ki-moon has organized a A63/VR/4 page 75 meeting to gain insight from health officials in th e run-up to the September 2010 Summit on the Millennium Development Goals. I believe it is our n oble duty as health ministers and professionals to turn our eyes and reach out to those who suffer fro m dreadful health conditions within or outside our borders. The Korean Government has pledged on many occasion s to expand its official development assistance volume to pay back the help we have rece ived from the international community. President Lee Myung-bak promised at the United Nations Genera l Assembly last September to triple the 2008 official development assistance to US$ 3 billion by 2015. As the first recipient-turned-donor country, we still remember the hardship that may be suffered by developing countries today. The Korean Government is more than ready to share our developm ent experience. What made us improve our dismal health care in a country devastated by war 5 0 years ago? First, technical assistance as well as material aid from the international community were important. With the support of WHO, we were able to effectively eradicate the malaria parasite and waterborne diseases. Second, training health-ca re workers was also a key success factor. Our Governme nt focused on fostering public health doctors and community health practitioners who could work in th e field. They were deployed at the basic administrative level and helped establish the prima ry health-care system in rural areas. They cared about mothers' health before and after childbirth, and led people to make changes in lifestyle and attitudes, enabling grassroots social reform. The ideas are in line with the established princip les and guidelines on international cooperation. The Korean Government truly understands the value o f the principles, as we learned them through our experience, and wishes to make them more valuable b y sharing them with others. We have already started projects to assist developing countries. Ho pefully, the success stories will be shared with yo u here someday. The right to health is one of the most fundamental human rights. We representatives here today, stand at the forefront to uphold that right. The in ternational community calls on us to work together to make progress towards the health-related Millennium Development Goals. It is time for us to join forces and stand united again, as we did in the fig ht against pandemic influenza, to achieve the ambitious goals by 2015, under the strong leadershi p of WHO. Thank you. Mr MCKERNAN (New Zealand): Mr President, koutou katoa , warm greetings from the people of New Zealand. New Zealand welcomes this debate in the Health Ass embly. We welcome WHO's work to assist Member States in achieving the Millennium De velopment Goals, and we also welcome the reports by other Member States here today on their progress. I want firstly to acknowledge the progress that ha s been made towards achieving the health- related Millennium Development Goals, in particular the reductions in child mortality. However, like many we do agree that there is also much that can a nd should be done to step up action where progress has been poor. There is strong agreement about the need to strengthen health systems to further progress the Millennium Development Goals. In New Z ealand, we have placed particular emphasis on health systems strengthening, including the key rol e of primary health care. Our surveys in New Zealand show that investment in primary care has be nefited the whole population but in particular vulnerable groups, especially those on low incomes or living in areas of economic deprivation. The New Zealand Government is working with health profe ssionals to drive change within primary care to achieve \"better, sooner, more convenient\" primary c are services. This includes: services which are delivered closer to home by a wider range of health professionals; the more effective prevention, identification and management of chronic diseases; new models of delivery to improve maternal and child health; improved access to diagnostic and tra ditionally hospital-based treatment services that a re now delivered in the primary care setting. Furtherm ore, the New Zealand Government recently announced a new approach to addressing the social a nd economic needs of families, with a focus on those families most at risk. The approach, named Whnau Ora , which loosely means \"family well-being\", is designed to allow families to take greater control of their future by reorientating th e delivery of health and social services around their identified needs. This initiative draws on indigen ous A63/VR/4 page 76 Maori approaches, shifting the emphasis from indivi dualized service delivery to one that better supports the needs and aspirations of the family or Whnau. Internationally, New Zealand has taken a lead role at the United Nations Human Rights Council in raising the issue of maternal mortality and the potential failure to meet Millennium Development Goal 5 as a significant human rights question. Univ ersal access to sexual and reproductive health information and services is integral to good matern al health. The progress report that will be considered later in the Health Assembly on reproduc tive health highlights the uneven progress in achieving international targets related to maternal , sexual and reproductive health. This is of great concern to us, and it must continue to be a focus f or our efforts at country, regional and global leve ls. In 2009, the New Zealand Parliamentarians Group on Population and Development convened an open hearing on maternal health in the Pacific, to highl ight the continued need to address the complex issues limiting improvements to maternal health in our region. The resulting findings and recommendations will guide New Zealand's efforts in working in the Pacific region and with other development partners. The report also highlights on ce again the need to improve data collection and information systems to better support monitoring pr ogress on the Millennium Development Goals. The world faces many pressing health issues, and w hile we would like to act on them all simultaneously, the reality is we cannot and priori ties must be set. The New Zealand Government has established a health target regime that identifies six key targets. These include targets for immunization, the management of cardiovascular dise ase and diabetes, and smoking. Our experience is that a focus on a few important health prioritie s leads to rapid improvement, for example our historically poor immunization rate has increased 1 7% over a two-year period to 85% and continues to climb. Youth smoking rates have halved in the last five years, while wider availability of highly cost - effective nicotine replacement therapy has seen a 2 00% increase in its use over the past 18 months. New Zealand is pleased that noncommunicable diseas es are now being seriously discussed in the context of the Millennium Development Goals. We cosponsored the resolution agreed in New York last week, calling for a United Nations hi gh-level meeting on noncommunicable diseases in September 2011. Preventing and managing such diseas es is not only an important new challenge in its own right, but will be essential for continued prog ress with the existing health-related Millennium Development Goals. Finally, New Zealand continues to place a high val ue on opportunities such as this Health Assembly to learn from and share our experience wit h other countries, both developing and developed. There is much that we can all learn from the rapid improvements in Millennium Development Goal indicators in a number of developing countries, oft en with limited resources. The Goals are our collective responsibility and we will all benefit w hen all countries achieve them - the sooner the better. For me, this is perhaps best summed up by a Mori proverb from New Zealand, which goes N t rourou, n taku rourou ka ora ai te iwi translated, this means \"With your basket with my b asket, the people will thrive\".

Mr President, I join our friends in congrat ulating you on your election as President of the Sixty-third World Health Assembly. We are confident that your leadership and wisdom will steer the deliberations to fruitful results. As always, Madam Director-General, your statement yesterday was very inspiring and illuminating. With only five years remaining to 2015, it makes s ense that we deliberate and review the status and progress of the health-related Millennium Devel opment Goals. I would like to thank WHO and the Executive Board for selecting these Goals as the th eme for this Health Assembly. The first democratically elected Government in Bhutan not onl y fully subscribes to the commitment made towards the achievement of the Millennium Developme nt Goals, but we have brought forward the date from 2015 to 2013 for the health-related Goals. Las t year, the Ministry of Health signed the compact with the Prime Minister for the acceleration of ach ievement of various aspirations, one of which is th e health-related Millennium Development Goals. Furthe r, poverty reduction, if not elimination, is the main theme of the current 10th Five-Year Developmen t Plan (2008-2013). Obviously, the Millennium Development Goals, as the Director-General said yes terday, are part of the overarching goal of poverty reduction. Our development goals and progra mmes are based on the development philosophy of gross national happiness, not gross national pro duct, which focuses on sustainable and equitable economic development, preservation of the environme nt, cultural and spiritual pursuits, and more importantly, good governance. Health is one of the nine domains of gross national happiness. If we are to achieve the Millennium Development Go als, which were conceived and designed to bring about equity and social justice, it is time t hat we review and revisit the fundamentals of the A63/VR/4 page 82 economic development paradigms. There is a need to harmonize the two dominant economic models of capitalism and communism. This is what we in Bhu tan strive to do through the application and adoption of the economic model infused by developme nt philosophy of gross national happiness. You know, and I know, that gross domestic product does not take into account the parameters like environment, climate change, and so on. As regards the acceleration of the achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals, we have also done some exercises on the requ irements of financial input. For a small and developing country like ours, we need over US$ 600 million, a substantial amount given the size of our economy. Bhutan now stands at a critical juncture - politic ally, economically and socially. For the first time, we have successfully hosted the Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the 16th such event, when a large and unprecedented number of high-level delegates from 17 countries and journalists from many countri es gathered recently in the small Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan. The hosting of such major events is necessary to help institutionalize the clean and vibrant democracy and also showcase the capabil ity and goodness of the Government. Only if the people have faith and trust in the elected Governme nt will democracy flourish in a country. Mindful of this, we have embarked on several reforms, includin g the Economic Development Policy, based on which the National Health Policy is being drafted. This will provide a clear and concrete direction fo r the delivery of health-care services on the basis o f equity and social justice. We look forward to continued support and cooperati on from our development partners as we tread past these milestones of health system develo pment, which is founded on principles of primary health care. Lastly, and in conclusion, I would lik e to thank WHO for its stewardship in global health . May this exemplary stewardship translate into a tim ely attainment of all health-related Millennium Development Goals in countries across the globe. I would like to thank you all for listening and Tashi Delek! Thank you. Mr NAGAHAMA (Japan) ( interpretation from the Japanese ): 1 Mr President, Director-General, honourable ministe rs, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Government of Japan, I would like to commend Dr Chan and WHO on their outstanding leadership in global health. I would also like to express my heartfelt sympathy for those who lost their lives in the Haiti earthquake and other recent natural disasters. Japa n greatly appreciates the role WHO plays in humanitarian response such as in Haiti, and the Jap anese Government is always supportive of such efforts. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 poses a serious threat to glo bal health security. Since last year. WHO and the Member States have taken collective action to address the pandemic, by making best use of preparedness gained so far. In Japan, we have taken active measures, such as enhancing surveillance, enforcing preventive measures in schools and public facilities, and providing appropriate medical services at community level. Japan has successfully contained the mortality rate at 0.15 per 100 000 people, which is relatively low compared to other c ountries. At the global level, Japan has actively contributed to efforts in developing countries, inc luding through WHO vaccine distribution. It is essential for the Secretariat and the Member States to strengthen preparedness based on the lessons learnt from the most recent experiences. We should further enhance the function of the International Health Regulations (2005) as well as promote intern ational cooperation. We have only five years left to achieve the Millen nium Development Goals. \"To protect people's lives\" is one of the policy pillars to whi ch the Administration of Prime Minister Hatoyama attaches particular importance. With its rich knowl edge and experience, Japan is committed to keep focusing on its support to maternal, newborn and ch ild health and the fight against infectious disease s in developing countries for reducing infant and mat ernal mortality rates. For this purpose, Japan believes that health systems strengthening such as health workforce development is critical, while 1 In accordance with Rule 89 of the Rules of Procedu re of the World Health Assembly. A63/VR/4 page 83 stronger collaboration across other sectors, such a s safe water, sanitation and education, is also essential. As for infectious diseases, Japan is committed to maintaining our global fight against three major infectious diseases and our efforts towards g lobal immunization. In addition, we should closely watch recent developments such as the spread of pol iomyelitis and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. For global poliomyelitis eradication, the affected countries and all partners should work as one, with strong political will. Controlling noncommunicable diseases is also an important issue. Our new Administration has decided to increase the price of tobacco. On 31 May, the World No Tobacco Day event will be held in Japan for the first time. In addition, we are actively engaged in the World Heal th Day campaign in Japan regarding healthier cities pr omoted by the WHO Centre for Health Development, Kobe. I look forward to the Global For um on Urbanization and Health, which will take place in Kobe in November of this year. Today, the international community faces more comp lex health challenges. WHO is expected to serve as a leading organization in coping with them . It is important for WHO to operate more effectively and efficiently, while mobilizing its r esources for activities where it enjoys a comparati ve advantage. To conclude my statement, I would like t o express Japan's willingness to further enhance its cooperation with WHO for a more significant imp act. Thank you very much for your attention. M.

Le Professeur R. Akda (Turquie), Vice-Pr\u00e9sident, a Madam Director-General, colleag ues and excellencies, allow me first of all to congratulate the President on his election to th e post of the President of the Sixty-third World Health Assembly. On behalf of my delegation, I woul d like to assure him and the Bureau of our full support. Allow me to add a few national points to what was already expressed by the distinguished colleague, Dr Jim\u00e9nez Garc\u00eda-Herrera, Minister of H ealth of Spain yesterday, on behalf of the European Union. The health-related Millennium Devel opment Goals have been rightly chosen as a leading theme of this year's Health Assembly openin g debate. We are fast approaching 2015, the year which our leaders set as a deadline for achieving t he Millennium Development Goals. Over the last nine years, much has been done but we have to admit that we have left many promises unfulfilled. I fully agree with the Director-General that the Goal s should not be seen independently but in a holisti c manner, in the context of strengthening health syst ems and applying robust and effective national and regional preventive measures. Among the items on our indeed large agenda, there are three items that Slovenia deems important. Firstly, Slovenia attaches particular at tention to the adoption of the global strategy to r educe harmful use of alcohol. Harmful use of alcohol has serious effects on public health globally. Today, too many young people die all over the world becaus e of it. That is why we need a global tool. Many countries, including my own, have adopted national and regional strategies. For many years, it has been clear that these individual efforts are simply not enough - we need a global approach, taking in account difference of our countries and proposing e vidence-based action. I hope that this Health Assembly will adopt the proposed strategy by consen sus, thus enabling us to act in a more coordinated manner. Second, let me mention the issue of the Strategic Approach to Integrated Chemicals Management. Slovenia is currently chairing the Bure au of the third Session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management that took place a year ago here in Geneva. This Health Assembly is discussing the Strategic Approach for t he second time. In 2006, our discussion was on a general level. This year we have to go deeper. The health effects of obsolete pesticides are not only a problem today, not of a single country and not of a single region. Indiscriminate overconsumption of pesticides, together with unsafe dumping, have been and still are a reality of the present world. The recent disaster that took place in Armenia is clear proof of this. This is why the European Union is proposing a resolution on better management of obso lete pesticides and other obsolete chemicals. We hope that the technical briefing Slovenia is organi zing today will shed some new light on what could be done in this respect. Let me also add that the d raft resolution on toxic waste proposed by Indonesi a complements the discussion on obsolete pesticides a nd other obsolete chemicals. Third, I would like to draw your attention to the issue of noncommunicable diseases. Like other developed countries, Slovenia has many problems ste mming from these diseases. We cooperate with our fellow European Union partners and the WHO Regi onal Office for Europe. But we have to do more, particularly by preventing unhealthy behaviou r in children and young people. We have to ensure conditions in which young people will be able to ma ke healthy choices. That is why we support a draft resolution proposed by Norway on the marketing of f ood and non-alcoholic beverages to children. A63/VR/4 page 85 In conclusion, let me reiterate our view that our joint problems could be solved only through genuine cooperation with each other. Together with WHO, we can address global health problems better and make this world a healthier place. I tha nk you, Mr Vice-President.

Dr DALIL (Afghanistan): Mr Vice-President, respected ministers, distinguis hed delegates, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate the President on his election to preside over the Sixty-third World Health Assembly, and to wish him success in this im portant assignment. I am delighted to report that investment in the he alth sector in Afghanistan over the last eight years is bearing results despite the enormous chall enges. A decade ago, the health situation of Afghanistan was more than dismal; in early 2002, th ere were only a limited number of functioning primary health facilities across the country. In fa ct, one woman died of pregnancy-related causes ever y 27 minutes. This meant that every week about 370 fa milies became motherless, which was tantamount to a death sentence for small children in Afghan so ciety. Similarly, high maternal mortality, poor nutrition, inadequate hygiene, illiteracy, poverty, and a lack of modern health care combined to produce one of the highest infant and child mortali ty rates in the world; in 2001, an estimated one in four children died before reaching their fifth birt hday. Addressing the poor health status, Afghanista n A63/VR/4 page 92 took effective strategic steps, including defining a basic package of health services aimed primarily at reducing mortality among rural women and children, and an essential package of hospital services for provincial and regional hospitals. Moreover, the Mi nistry took on a stewardship role and contracted out the delivery of primary health-care services to nongovernmental organizations. Furthermore, thousands of community-based midwives as well as co mmunity health workers were trained and deployed in their own communities. All this subsequ ently led to about a 25% reduction in child mortality over the past few years. Although we have presumably made progress on Millennium Development Goal G, our progress on Goal 5 is not e vident. All moves were bold and prudent, rationalizing the delivery of health services in a way that is unique in the world and entirely appropriate, given where Afghanistan was in 2002. H owever, we are still lagging behind global and regional set targets. There is a long way to go in improving the health situation of our country. We believe that without an effective health system , no programme can be stable and successful. We have also learnt that building health-system ele ments should be addressed concurrently while the services are scaled up in a post-conflict environme nt. Currently Afghanistan is focusing on improving access, developing human resources for health, stre ngthening monitoring and evaluation, integrating health service delivery, and reforming administrati on and financing. We recognize the importance of the private sector for strengthening the health sys tem. We would like to encourage and support it to expand its services to a wider range. We have signi ficant experience of working with nongovernmental organizations through public-privat e partnerships and performance-based contract mechanisms, and we are looking forward to sharing i t with countries of similar context. Eradication of poliomyelitis is the biggest global public health initiative. Afghanistan is still one of the four endemic countries with wild poliovirus. We stand fully committed to this cause. His Excellency the President of Afghanistan has on many occasions in the country, and at international forums, expressed his commitment that eradication o f poliomyelitis is a priority of our Government. We will do our best not to let conflict stand betwe en our children and the vaccine against poliomyelitis, and to ensure community ownership an d an integrated response in order to eradicate poliovirus. We are working for the days of tranquil lity in the immunization rounds when our vaccinators can access every child and immunize eac h child safely. Let me reaffirm our commitment on behalf of the Government of Afghanistan for the eradication of poliovirus in the country, fighting to wipe out the last reservoir in Afghanistan. I am happy to have shared our progress and challen ges with this august gathering. We are thankful to the international community for support ing Afghanistan and that we have translated this support into life-saving critical gains. To keep th e pace of progress and to maintain the gains, we ar e in need of additional and continued support from donor s and partners. We are certain that progress in the health sector is an important factor for ensuring s ocioeconomic development, promoting peace and having a stable and prosperous Afghanistan. A stabl e and peaceful Afghanistan will nurture stability and progress in the region. Thank you very much. El Dr. MANZUR (Argentina): Se\u00f1or Argentina, Regi\u00f3n m\u00e9ricas, se caracteriza por tener un epidemiol\u00f3gico en se principal de muerte en la actualidad, con un marco sostenido de su lucha las enfermedades y las creaci\u00f3n puesta Instituto Nacional del C\u00e1ncer. En este contexto, consideramos que el mayor las personas y las pa de salud y de atenci\u00f3n primaria de la Republica Argentina. Es ha millones incluidas el de letargo, poni\u00e9ndola la incorpor\u00e1ndolas las pol\u00edticas nacionales de salu con su apropiaci\u00f3n por parte de los niveles provinciales y ladies and gentlemen, good morning. At the outset, allow me to congratulate the President on his election. Rest assured of the Phil ippine delegation's support as you lead us towards a successful outcome of this Sixty-third World Health Assembly. The Government of the Republic of the Philippines remains fully committed to achieving its targets under the Millennium Development Goals by 2 015. The global economic and financial crisis A63/VR/4 page 9G notwithstanding, the country has persevered in its efforts. Our Department of Health has taken bold steps to reform the health system, focusing on serv ice delivery, regulation, financing and good governance. In the course of our efforts to meet th e health-related Millennium Development Goal targets, several key challenges have been identifie d, and these are being urgently addressed by the Government, through the Department of Health: first , the challenge of reducing maternal, infant and child mortality rates across the regions in our cou ntry, across wealth quintiles and between rural and urban areas; secondly, the challenge of balancing p opulation growth with family planning; thirdly, the challenge of mobilizing adequate resources for the public health sector in order to make health services accessible and affordable for all Filipino s; and lastly, the challenge of effectively coordin ating national and local government efforts, so as to for ge synergies and partnerships among relevant stakeholders, including the private sector, towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Despite these challenges, the Philippines is worki ng hard to meet its commitments under the Millennium Development Goals. We have refused to be hamstrung by limited resources, choosing instead to fund critical health programmes aimed at making an impact on the reduction of maternal, infant and child mortality rates all across the cou ntry. Under the Maternal Neonatal and Child Health and Nutrition policy, resources have been put into upgrading the capacities of village health faciliti es, enabling them to provide basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care, even in remote areas. We are pushing for the recognition of adequate fam ily planning services as an important tool to achieve the health-related Millennium Development G oals. We have also directed resources for public health programmes such as tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS, encouraging the active participation of local government units in these health programme s through the Province-wide Investments for Health. At the same time, we have continuously enga ged the private sector and civil society in helping craft policies, enhancing service delivery and ensu ring good governance. To address the health needs of the poor, our National Health Insurance Program is working for the universal coverage of the indigent population, while the prices of essential drugs and services are being regulated to ensure quality and affordability. Poverty reduction progra mmes such as the Conditional Cash Transfer Program, also aim to improve the poor's utilization of basic social services such as health and nutrition, while also helping poor women gain acces s to reproductive health, family planning and maternal health information. The international community is at an important cro ssroads in fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals. Five years on, we will be lookin g back at what we have accomplished and will assess whether we had done enough to uphold our peo ples' right to health. We hope that when that time comes, we can all say that we did our utmost. Despite the odds, we are one with all stakeholders in sustaining and enhancing current efforts, while looking for new avenues to improve the efficiency of our services. We must be united in a concerted e ffort to uplift our respective countries which have lagged behind in the attainment of the Millennium D evelopment Goals. The Philippines thus joins the call to all Governments to increase political and f inancial commitments to meet the Goals. Five years may seem like a short time for many, but it also re presents boundless opportunities to either make or break our efforts. We fervently hope that all of us will make the most of the remaining time we have. Thank you Mr Vice-President and Mabuhay ! Ms JUR\u00c1SKOV\u00c1 (Czech Republic): President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the C zech Republic attaches great importance to achieving the Millennium Development Goals defined in the Millennium Declaration of 2000 and reaffirmed at the United Nations World Summit in 20 05. At this Summit, the international community again expressed its determination to eradicate extr eme poverty, its causes and consequences. We are well aware of how much remains to be done to achiev e the Millennium Development Goals, notably in reducing child mortality, improving maternal hea lth, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. I believe that the United Nations General Assembly High-Level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals in September of this y ear will be an opportunity to bring even more coherence to the current initiatives that are takin g place around the world, at a national, regional a nd international level. The global economic and financ ial crisis has significantly affected economic and social progress achieved during recent decades. Tho se devastating impacts are being felt worldwide - A63/VR/4 page 95 both in the developed and developing countries. In the developing countries, the reversed impact is particularly worrisome. Therefore, the consequences of the crisis reinforce the need for particular attention to those Millennium Development Goals and to those regions where the least progress has been made. The Czech Republic is particularly concerned about the fact that in sub-Saharan Africa, close to 50% of all children and mothers die during pregnanc y and delivery. The Czech Republic, as a European Union Member State, holds the firm belief that the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals will not be achieved unless the right to attain the highest standard of reproductive health is promoted and protected. We need to acknowledge that, while certain progress has been made, this right re mains unfulfilled for too many women and young girls with devastating and far-reaching consequence s. A key factor affecting the progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and sustainable de velopment is also education. The reduction of sickness and mortality rates, the empowerment of wo men, improvement of the quality of the labour force and promotion of democracy can be largely ass isted by progress in education. In other words, universal access to education is fundamental to the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. In conclusion, let me assure you that the Czech Re public, as a European Union Member State, is fully aligned with the European Union's commitments to intensify development assistance, adopted in 2008 and reaffirmed in 2009. The Czech Republic als o fully supports the European Union's multi- sectoral approach to combating poverty, which shoul d not be perceived solely in economic terms but also in the broader context of social, environmenta l and health issues. Thank you for your attention. The PRESIDENT: Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to adjourn this m orning's session. The meeting is adjourned. The meeting rose at 12:05. La s\u00e9ance est lev\u00e9e \u00e0 12h05. A63/VR/5 page 96 FIFTH PLENARY MEETING Tuesday, 18 May 2010, at 14:45 President: Mr Mondher INVITED SPEAKERS INTERVENANTS INVIT\u00c9S The PRESIDENT: The Health Assembly is called to order. Good after noon, ladies and gentlemen. The Health Assembly will now take up consideration of item 4 o f the agenda, Invited speakers. It is an honour for me to introduce our first invited speaker at this S ixty-third World Health Assembly, Her Excellency, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia. President, Johnson Sirleaf has led a distinguished international career spanning nearly four decades, and began her career in banking and econom ic and financial management in 1965. In 1992, the President joined the United Nations Development Programme in New York as Assistant Administrator and Director of its Regional Bureau o f Africa with the rank of Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations. In 2003, Ellen Johns on Sirleaf returned to Liberia and was elected President of Liberia in January 2006. In 2007, Pres ident Johnson Sirleaf was awarded the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom. More recently, in Ap ril 2010 President Johnson Sirleaf graciously accepted to be the honorary President of the Women' s Health Commission for the African Region. Distinguished delegates, please join me in welcomin g the President of the Republic of Liberia. (Applause/Applaudissements) It is with pleasure that I invite Her Excellency t o go to the rostrum. Madam President, you have the floor. Mrs Ellen JOHNSON SIRLEAF (President of the Republi c of Liberia): Distinguished delegates, Dr Chan, Director-General , other officials of the World Health Organization, ladies and gentlemen. I am here today to join you in asserting that people should not have to die, simply because they are poor. I am her e to join in saying that people should not die because treatments common in the rest of the world are not available where they live. I am here today A63/VR/5 page 97 because I believe that a child should not have to d ie because a parent has to make the impossible choice between feeding her family, or taking her si ck child to the clinic that could have saved her li fe. I am delighted, and honoured, to speak to you this morning. Dr Chan, I thank you and I welcome the opportunity to address this important event in the international calendar. WHO has long been an institution of global significance. If anyt hing, it has become ever more vital as the world moves into the twenty-first century. Pandemics can spread without passports. Diseases d on't stop at national borders or checkpoints. Improving the health of our people is not only of f undamental importance to our nations and our citizens themselves; it also has crucial economic a nd geopolitical implications that reach far beyond the narrow interests of any one country. In a globa lized planet, the world's health has to be a shared responsibility. As we face up to the challenge of a chieving our Millennium Development Goals, as we strive to save the lives of women and children, and tackle the deadly impact of malaria, of HIV and AIDS, events such as today's Health Assembly help u s face up to and shoulder that responsibility together. Because success will make a fundamental d ifference not only to my country and its people, but also to Africa, the developing world and the pl anet as a whole. My message today is simple: individually, and coll ectively, we are making progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, but we are not making that progress fast enough. To achieve our ambition, we must continue our work tog ether towards improving the health systems of our countries. We must also do more together to rem ove the barriers that stand in the way of people taking advantage of those systems. Fourteen years of war will damage a country in mul tiple ways. In the case of Liberia, my country, the impact of the civil conflict on the co untry's health system was particularly severe. In 1989, Liberia had 800 practising doctors. By 2003, we had just 50. Clinics and hospitals across the country were destroyed. Even the roads needed to al low people to travel to the few facilities that survived lay in ruins. Less than half our populatio n had access to medical care of any sort! Today, we have renovated and built new clinics, midwifery sch ools and health training centres. With support from the Swiss Development Corporation, we have ren ovated and reactivated one of our major rural referral hospitals and a second one is nearing comp letion with support from China. We have improved general referral services and access to medicines a cross the country; and we have more than quadrupled the number of facilities offering compre hensive and emergency neonatal care. We are pleased to have established our \"Basic Pack age of Health Services\" in over 80% of the nation's health facilities, ahead of our target dat e. As a result, more people are receiving free serv ices, and the simple standards set out in the Package giv e priority to the interventions that will have the greatest benefit to our nation's health. In tacklin g malaria, without a doubt our country's biggest he alth problem, we have tripled the distribution of free i nsecticide-treated bednets which has helped malaria prevalence fall by half in the four years to 2009. The evidence from our health surveys suggests that we are seeing other results. Our current child mortality rate, for example, has fallen to al most 50% over the last few years. The latest Demographic and Health Survey, conducted in 2007, p uts the overall child mortality at 72 deaths per 1000 live births as compared to the 2000 data of 13 2 deaths to 1000 live births. These are good signs. They show that we can make progress, however challe nging the conditions we face. Unfortunately, not all the news is so positive. Th e latest figures for maternal mortality in Liberia suggest that nearly one in 1000 women die even as t hey bring new life into the world - a sharp increase from previous years. This is a shocking st atistic, and one reason why I became involved with the Women's Health Commission for the African Regio n - a WHO initiative, launched last month, in my capacity as Honorary President. The Commission i s called upon to produce recommendations on what more can be done to reduce the unacceptable le vel of maternal mortality in our part of the world. We eagerly await its recommendations. We are also d oing all we can to tackle the tragedy of mothers who are dying needlessly. As well as improving emer gency obstetrics care and training more midwives to work where they are needed most, we hav e also adopted the \"Reach Every Pregnant Woman\" approach, which seeks to ensure that every p regnant woman across the country gets medical attention during pregnancy and delivers her baby at a health facility. We have seen the numbers at these clinics increasing, although the challenges r emain awesome - especially as regards increasing A63/VR/5 page 98 teenage pregnancy. Yet, we know that putting system s in place is not enough on its own. We must do more to allow and to convince our people to take ad vantage of such systems once they are available. Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, over 90% of Li berians live on less that US$ 2 a day. In that grim statistic, they are not alone. Around the worl d, there are millions of people who have so little to live on that any costs required for treatment - no matter how low - are still far too high. That is wh y, in September last year, a group of countries, inclu ding Liberia, committed to extending the principle of free health care to more of our people. Alongside B urundi, Ghana, Malawi, Nepal and Sierra Leone and we announced new ways of allowing those who mos t need medical help - especially those who are targeted by the Millennium Development Goals - to get the health care they need without having to pay up-front. Sierra Leone, our neighbouring country, just last month, launched its new programme aimed at mothers and children. Early reports of a huge incre ase in patients at clinics point to just how many people were not getting the treatment they needed b efore, simply because of the cost. In Liberia's case, last year I committed to making permanent our temporary suspension of user fees and to providing free health care for all, depending on th e continuing support of adequate donor finance to make this possible. Offering free health-care servi ces at all public health facilities has significant ly increased out-patient attendance across the country . Similarly, expanding access to health care by building more clinics and health facilities in area s that were previously underserved is making a big difference. In addition, we now have more trained h ealth workers and have implemented various policies aimed at ensuring that health care is equi table. I understand that there is still debate around the merits of removing user fees - and we must make sure that we go about doing so in the right an d sustainable way. But, equally it is clear to me t hat the people who are least able to pay for their care should not be the ones forced to do so. The implication is clear: often such people simply do n ot have the money to pay. And often they die as a result. Of course, free health care costs money. If user fees are not to be charged, the money has to come from somewhere. The initiatives I mentioned were made possible tha nks to over US$ 5 billion of investment developed by the High-Level Task Force on Innovativ e International Financing for Health Systems launched in September 2008 by the former United Kin gdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown and World Bank President Robert Zoellick. UNITAID, championed by former French Foreign Minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, is one of these innovations. In three years UNITAID has raised more than US$ 1 billion to provide life-saving treatments for HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis patients around the world. These diseases contribute to the death of over 4.5 million people every year. More than 70% of UNITAID finances come from a solidarity levy on airline tickets. Eleven member countries impose the levy today, with others agreei ng to contribute in the future. The result of their innovation is that 10 million more women and childr en will get the medical care they need to save their lives. We recognize that since the 2000 Millennium Declar ation, the total development assistance for health has more than doubled, and this has saved co untless lives. The fact remains, however, that more money is still needed if we are to achieve the Mill ennium Development Goals. It goes without saying that we must use the money that is currently availa ble more efficiently. We have to make the most of every dollar already found, or to be found in the f uture. We have to target it where it will make the most difference and ensure that our systems are as effective and accountable as they can be. There is, at the same time, the need to allocate m ore money - money that needs to come from domestic sources, prioritizing where necessary, but also from our international partners and the various sources of international aid - so that a re liable flow of funds can be targeted at those areas that need change. The stark fact is that unless more is done, and done quickly, some of the Millennium Development Goals could end up being nothing more t han well-intentioned ambitions that, ultimately, do not achieve all that they have set out to attain . My goal, our goal, your goal, must be to do more t han this. It must be to build on the good work already done. It must be to continue working togeth er at events like today's to ensure that our mother s, our sisters, our children will not have to pay the price for failure today with their lives tomorrow. You are at the front line of all that we do. You identi fy the challenges. You lead the change. You make th e sacrifices. For that we salute you and I thank you. A63/VR/5 page 99 (Applause/Applaudissements) The PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Madam President. On behalf of the Health Assembly, I express our sincere thanks for your address today. It is an hon our for the Health Assembly to have you here and to hear your views. I am now very pleased to welcome, on behalf of the Health Assembly, Mr Ray Chambers, the United Nations Secretary-General's first Special En voy for Malaria. Mr Chambers is a philanthropist and humanitarian, and has been serving as Special E nvoy since February 2008. In his capacity, he has committed to achieve the Secretary-General's goal o f ensuring universal access to malaria prevention tools in all countries in which the disease is ende mic by the end of 2010, with the ultimate goal of achieving near zero preventable malaria deaths by 2 015. Most of his other efforts have been directed towards children. He is the Founding Chairman of th e Points of Light Foundation and co-founded, with Colin Powell, America's Promise Alliance. Mr C hambers is Co-Founder of the National Mentoring Partnership, and Founding Chairman of bot h The Millennium Promise Alliance and Malaria No More. Mr Chambers is a member of the Pre sident's Council on Service and Civic Participation. It is with pleasure that I invite Mr Ray Chambers to go to the rostrum. (Applause/Applaudissements) Mr Chambers, you have the floor. Mr Ray CHAMBERS (United Nations Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Malaria): Mr President, Director-General Dr Margaret Chan, E xcellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour and a privilege to have been invited to spea k before you today. Just three years ago, you took the decision to create a World Malaria Day to be ce lebrated on 25 April each year. The following year, in 2008, the Secretary-General of the United Nation s, Mr Ban Ki-moon, appointed his first Special Envoy for Malaria. Soon after, he called for all pe ople at risk of malaria to be provided with preventive, diagnostic and treatment measures by th e end of 2010 and an end to deaths from malaria by 2015. At the time many thought this overambitiou s. As you know, there has been tremendous progress, a s recorded in WHO's most recent World malaria report presented last December here in Geneva. Thirty-eig ht countries have recorded declines in cases and deaths by over 50% since 2000; nine of these are in sub-Saharan Africa. The health ministers who have demonstrated such leadership in this fight are to be congratulated. Of course, this did not happen just because of act ivities since the Secretary-General's call. However, that call, and its immediate endorsement b y the Chair of the African Union, led to a dramatic increase in funding available for malaria. This was primarily from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Bank and the United States President's Malaria Initiative as well as from the United Kingdom and other bilate ral partners, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, UNITAID, UNICEF and members of the private sector. These commitments, as well as increases in funding from endemic countries themselves, allowed for the rapid scale-up of WHO-recommended malaria-control interventions, primarily in sub-Sah aran Africa. The active work of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership under the leadership of Profess or Awa Marie Coll-Seck ensured continued advocacy and the development of the comprehensive G lobal Malaria Action Plan. The efforts and resources have largely been focuse d on sub-Saharan Africa to date. Why this focus? As you all know, 85% of the world's malaria cases are found on the continent as well as 90% of the deaths, most of those among children under f ive years of age. These tragic deaths are entirely unnecessary as the tools exist to prevent them. In my role of Special Envoy, I concentrate on advo cacy, the mobilization of resources, and helping to remove any obstacle in a country's path to achieving the universal coverage target. In orde r to do this well, my own experience from business te lls me that communications have to be brief, focused and clear. We, therefore, used the bednet a s the symbol of an action that was immediately A63/VR/5 page 100 understandable to the lay person, affordable and do able. In the United States we started a campaign to raise both awareness and funds, based on the slogan \"US$ 10 buys a net, saves a life.\" This was picked up in popular television programmes, by many nongov ernmental organizations and professional associations and created what the media people call a \"buzz\" around malaria - particularly that controlling it was achievable. It was extraordinari ly successful. By the end of 2009, nearly US$ 4 billion had been committed to the fight again st malaria. In 2009 alone, nearly US$ 1.5 billion was disbursed. Much of the funding did indeed go to nets, but by no means all. Much was spent on the life-saving antimalarials - the artemisinin-based c ombination therapies - as well as on diagnostics an d indoor residual spraying. While this increase in fu nding has been dramatic, we are still far short of the approximately US$ 5 billion per year that is requir ed to scale up these effective tools. Thirty months ago it was estimated that 700 millio n people were at risk from malaria in Africa. WHO estimated that one bednet for every two people would be needed to achieve universal coverage. That meant 350 million long-lasting insecticide-tre ated bednets - approved by WHO's Pesticide Evaluation Scheme - had to be procured and distribu ted, which would require a tremendous effort from manufacturers, national malaria programmes, an d partners involved in distribution and communications. The response has been terrific, and today I can say that over 325 million nets have already been financed, 93% of the originally calcul ated need. Over 200 million of these have been delivered to countries, and most have either been d istributed or are in the process of distribution. T he remaining nets are either in the production queue o r being delivered. Therefore, despite the doubts of some, the Secreta ry-General's goal will be met as far as the delivery of nets is concerned. In its 2009 World malaria report , WHO demonstrated that in countries that have achieved high coverage with nets and othe r malaria-control interventions, the decline in malaria cases and deaths that follows is dramatic, often exceeding 50%. WHO has also shown that in a number of countries, the benefits go beyond malaria , and extend to sharp reductions in overall child mortality. For many countries, the control of malar ia will enable the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of child survival, Goal 4. These d eclines have the potential to ease the pressure on medical facilities in countries in which the diseas e is endemic. I witnessed this myself last August when I travelled to Zanzibar, in the United Republi c of Tanzania, along with the WHO Director- General - Dr Chan - and Dr Tachi Yamada of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The 12-bed paediatric ward of the main hospital was empty! App arently, up to two years before it had been overflowing, often with two children to a bed. Thes e results were achieved through the widespread availability of effective treatment with artemesini n-based combination therapy, the universal distribution of nets, and universal indoor spraying . I know many of you are thinking about the optimal deployment of nets and indoor spraying with a range of insecticides. Clearly a comprehensive approach to control the malaria vector is required to make further gains as well as sustain our curren t efforts. We must also take care to deploy these and newly developed insecticides and contain the spread of resistance as we will need a full arsenal of all effective insecticides for years to come. Beyond prevention with nets and spraying, the scal e-up of other malaria-control interventions is accelerating, but still lags far behind. Yet there is good news on this front. With regard to treatmen t, the number of WHO quality artemisinin-based combina tion therapies has increased and their price has dropped significantly from what it was a few years ago. Nevertheless, we are still seeing the overuse of oral artemisinin monotherapies, and this is dang erous as it may foster resistance to the best available medicines against malaria. Resistance to artesunate was reported in 2009 at t he Thai-Cambodian border, where artemisinins have been used alone as monotherapies for many years, especially in the private sector. When treated with an oral artemisinin-based monothe rapy, most patients feel well after two to three days and, for this reason, discontinue treatment. S ince they do not take the seven days of treatment required with oral artemisinin-based monotherapy, t hey may remain with persistent parasites in their blood. Without a second drug given as part of a com bination (as is done with artemisinin-based combination therapy), these resistant parasites sur vive and can be passed on quickly to a mosquito and then another person. These monotherapies are theref ore the primary driving force behind the development of resistance by the malaria parasite t o artemisinins. As Dr Chan and Dr Newman, the Director of the Glob al Malaria Programme at WHO, have stated, the widespread availability of artemisinin monotherapies is one of the most dangerous threats A63/VR/5 page 101 to our collective efforts. If resistance to artemis inins develops and spreads to other large geographi cal areas, as has happened before with chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, we could have a public health disaster. There are currently no alte rnatives to these life-saving antimalarial medicine s, and there will not be one for the treatment of falc iparum malaria in the near future. It is, therefore, imperative that oral artemisinin -based monotherapies be rapidly removed from the market, as was called for in the 2007 Health As sembly resolution on this issue. Progress has been made, but not fast enough. There are at least 37 ph armaceutical companies still involved in the production and marketing of oral artemisinin-based monotherapies, and 29 countries that allow the marketing and use of these compounds. The time has now come for all nations to band together and halt this practice once and for all. Before it is t oo late. On the positive side, we have seen a rising use of rapid diagnostic tests which have become increasingly reliable. The increasing availability of quality-assured tests allowed WHO to recently recommend that all persons with suspected malaria r eceive a diagnostic test prior to the treatment of confirmed cases. Through the use of diagnostic test s, health-care workers are able not only to target artemisinin-based combination therapy to those who actually need it, but also determine which patients have other causes for their fevers - such as pneumonia - and to treat them appropriately. The universal use of diagnostics therefore has the pote ntial not only to diminish the unnecessary use of artemisinin-based combination therapy, and, therefo re, save money, but also to improve the treatment of febrile illness, and contribute to continued imp rovements in child survival. I know that all of you are deeply committed to bui lding health systems in your countries. I also know that many of you have watched, likely with som e amusement, the debate among donors and partners on whether or not to focus on health syste ms, or whether to control disease. I know you have no choice but to do both, and of course the two are inseparable. There is no doubt in my mind that malaria interventions have boosted health systems d evelopment. Whether it is in lowering stress on the system (as in Zanzibar), providing commodities that lead to a more integrated approach to treating sic k children (as in Zambia), supporting the development of community health cadres to link communities with health services (as in Ethiopia and Rwanda), o r delivering malaria-control services through accredited social health activists (as in India), c ontrolling and reducing malaria has had a remarkabl y positive and rejuvenating impact on health systems. This can and should go much further. In my visits to countries in which malaria is endemic, health mi nisters have always reminded me that malaria is a major cause of poor pregnancy outcomes, including m aternal mortality. Many countries have programmes targeted at preventing pregnant women fr om getting malaria. However, this objective should be more assertively pursued. One idea may be to ask local religious leaders to ensure that each couple getting married receives a bednet. Just as W HO has reported a decline in cases and deaths from malaria in many countries, the same tools could be used to reduce the number of complications in pregnancy and child birth in malaria-endemic countr ies and reduce further the burden on health systems. I have not yet touched on another issue: the burde n malaria puts on the economy. In the past, several figures have been quoted for the annual bur den for sub-Saharan Africa. These range from US$ 12 billion to US$ 30 billion. Whichever is more accurate, the economic burden is tremendous. Heads of State and ministers of finance have been k een to see this burden reduced. The recently formed African Leaders Malaria Alliance is currentl y composed of 27 Heads of State who are particularly concerned about this. They want to see an end to malaria being such a drag on their economies. Three weeks ago, at an event at the Worl d Bank in Washington DC, the Bank's President, Bob Zoellick, and the finance ministers of the Demo cratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya and Zambia all spoke to this. They see the fight against malar ia as an investment, not a cost. I recognize in the audience today someone you know well, Joy Phumaphi, the former Minister of Health of Botswana, who is the interim Executive-Secretary for the Alli ance. On a personal note, I want to thank Dr Chan and he r colleagues, particularly Dr Nakatani, Dr Newman, and staff of the Global Malaria Programm e, as well as the Regional Director for Africa, Dr Luis Sambo, for their unwavering support to my m ission to help achieve the goals set by the Secretary-General. I know they have been struggling for resources, but I can witness the impact of their work. They deserve your increasing financial support as they systematically improve the tools to track, prevent, diagnose and treat malaria and, wit h that, make a contribution to global health that g oes A63/VR/5 page 102 far beyond the impact on malaria alone. The WHO rep ort I have cited is just one example of the work that is done, much of it away from the glare of pub licity. You can be justifiably proud of the way the y serve you and your countries. To conclude, I would like to highlight a number of required actions as we move forward. First, we cannot let up now. We need to sustain the gains and finish the job. This will mean securing stable financing and diversifying the funding base, includ ing with greater domestic commitments. There needs to be greater dialogue between health ministe rs and finance ministers, particularly with evidenc e on the return on investment. I cited the recent ann ouncement at the World Bank of an additional US$ 200 million investment with the participation o f three African finance ministers. Another recent example is Nigeria's groundbreaking allocation of d omestic and debt relief resources to procure and distribute 10 million nets and to invest resources in managing a decentralized malaria programme in the 37 states. As a businessman, I see why finance ministers are captivated by their malaria investments. It is a concrete investment that deliv ers measurable financial and human returns. The more the linkages between the two ministries can be strengthened, the more confident I am, not only in our ability to finance our existing efforts, but also importantly, in our efforts to continue that financing and avoid a catastrophic resurgence. Secondly, we need to replace nets as they wear out , closing the gap between net ownership and usage (which is already narrowing but needs sustain ed advocacy and communications). Thirdly, we must continue to scale up diagnosis, treatment and, importantly, surveillance for malaria. Finally, it is critical that we insist on the banning of the use o f oral artemisinin-based monotherapies, and increas e our vigilance regarding parasite resistance to anti malarials and mosquito resistance to insecticides. There is also the hope of new tools on the horizon . For the first time, a malaria vaccine is in the midst of phase III trials in seven countries. In 20 15, there will be sufficient data for WHO to review regarding its safety and efficacy, and to make a re commendation regarding whether it should be added to the armamentarium of existing malaria-control to ols. Further research is also needed on new insecticides, diagnostics and antimalarial medicine s. Excellencies, progress has been rapid and palpable . We have seen how the Secretary-General's ambitious call is turning into reality. The possibi lity of having such a positive impact on so many millions of people only comes to us rarely, perhaps once in a lifetime. I am determined to keep the focus so that we will see the impact clearly on rea ching the Millennium Development Goals on maternal health, child health, and malaria. If we d o that we will also have a major impact on reducing poverty and dramatically improving lives and produc tivity in malaria-affected countries. The results are within reach but they require determination and constancy to achieve and sustain them. I look to the Health Assembly to monitor this and ensure succ ess. Thank you once more for this opportunity to address you. (Applause/Applaudissements) The PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Dr Chambers. On behalf of the Health Assembly, I wish to express our appreciation for sharing with us your thoughtful wo rds. This concludes our consideration of item 4 of our agenda. I would now like to request that delegates remain seated for a few minutes while the Director-General and I bid farewell to our guests. Thank you. A63/VR/5 page 103 2. ADDRESS BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL (continued) ALLOCUTION DU DIRECTEUR G\u00c9N\u00c9RAL (suite) The PRESIDENT: Distinguished delegates, the Health Assembly will now resume its consideration of item 3 of the agenda, concurrent with the third meeting of Commit tee A. The first two speakers on my list are Congo and Mongolia. May I invite them to the rostru m. I give the floor to the delegate of Congo.

Tel est le contenu synth\u00e9tis\u00e9 du message de mon pa ys, la R\u00e9publique du Congo, qui est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, A63/VR/5 nos propos sa ns Monsieur le les Mr President, Director-General, ex cellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, in order to ensure the successful implem entation of the Millennium Development Goals as set out by the United Nations at the beginning of t he new millennium, the Parliament of Mongolia defined and approved its own Mongolian-specific \"Mi llennium Development Deve lopment Policy\". I am grateful for the opportunity given to me to speak about the implemen tation of the four health-related Millennium Development Goals. First, with regard to the Goal of reducing the und er-five mortality rate by two thirds between 1990 and 2015, the infant mortality rate in Mongoli a per 1000 live births has dropped from 64.4 in 1990 to 20.2 in 2009, while the under-five mortalit y rate per 1000 live births has dropped from 88.8 i n 1990 to 23.6 in 2009, both of which reflect a signi ficant reduction. Mongolia has long implemented programmes that target child survival in collaborat ion with WHO and other international organizations, including the Child Survival Program me, the Maternal and Child Health Programme, the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses Pr ogramme, the Preventing Childhood Malnutrition Programme, the Micronutrients and Vita min Deficiency Programme and the Expanded Programme on Immunization. As a result of these pro grammes, the percentage of the under-five mortality rate caused by preventable diseases has s ignificantly decreased. Secondly, with regard to the Goal of providing acc ess to required reproductive health services to all individuals of appropriate age, and reducing th e maternal mortality rate by three quarters between 1990 and 2015, the Government is currently implemen ting the State Policy on Population Development, the Third National Reproductive Health Programme, and the second generation of the Strategy to Reduce Maternal Mortality. As a result of these policies and strategies, maternal mortalit y rates in Mongolia have shown a steady decline since the 1990s. For example, the maternal mortality rate in 2008 was 48.6 per 100 000 live births, whic h reflects a 250% decrease (in one year alone) compared to statistics in 1990. However, the matern al mortality rate in 2009 experienced a dramatic increase (81.4 per 100 000 live births) as a result of the 17 deaths from pregnancy complications caused by the pandemic (H1N1) 2009. On this note, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude, on behalf of the Government of Mongolia, to WHO for it s invaluable assistance in the fight against the pandemic influenza. In order to substantially reduc e the maternal mortality rate, the Government of Mongolia has already carried out several major init iatives, such as establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework for the implementation of the Strategy to Reduce Maternal Mortality 2005-2010 and revising the National Strategy to Imp rove Maternal and Child Health Care to further intensify implementation. In addition, the Governme nt needs to improve medical management and personnel skills of these facilities to provide com prehensive, accessible and good-quality maternal health-care services, and to introduce medical appr oaches of an international standard in the medical technology and laboratory capacity of these facilit ies that are applicable to national specifics. Moreover, the health-sector response capacity in ti mes of emergency and disaster-related situations should be significantly improved by setting up a fu nd for essential medicines and medical supplies, establishing a nationwide prenatal and neonatal car e centre, and extending the existing maternity care houses in the rural areas. The Government has been paying due attention to ensuring that the salaries of health professionals have increased, that incent ive mechanisms for health professionals have been revised and updated, and that the social welfare se rvices for health professionals have also been guaranteed. It is also important for my Government to target rural and poverty-stricken women who constitute the biggest risk group for maternal mort ality, by carrying out intersectoral activities. Thirdly, with regard to the Goal of combating sexu ally transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, the Government is committed to increasing its efforts t o improve HIV/AIDS preventive activities and to limit the prevalence of this disease by 2015. There have been 71 registered cases of HIV infection and HIV/AIDS-related deaths in Mongolia since 1992. In comparison to other countries in the world, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Mongolia is quite low. Ho wever, closer attention needs to be paid in this A63/VR/5 page 105 area, as Mongolia's only two neighbours are countri es with high prevalences of HIV/AIDS. This effectively puts Mongolia in a high-risk position. Finally, with regard to the Goal of combating tube rculosis, the Government has committed to reducing the prevalence of tuberculosis by 2015. Tu berculosis accounts for 10.8% of all registered infectious disease cases in Mongolia. Due to the in troduction of international standards in diagnosis and treatment, as outlined in the National Agenda f or Fighting Tuberculosis, the success rate of tuberculosis treatment has increased to approximate ly 85%. From 1990 to 1995 there were 119 registered cases of tuberculosis-related mortal ity. However, this number dropped to 78 between 2002 to 2008. My Government is paying close attenti on to reducing the prevalence of multidrug- resistant tuberculosis, and provides free treatment for tuberculosis by covering all-related medical expenses for treatment. This policy approach has be en one of the main reasons for the significant decrease in the rate of tuberculosis infection in M ongolia. With cooperation from other governments, nongovern mental organizations and the public, the Government will align the necessary funding with th e desired Millennium Development Goal targets, improve the capacity of monitoring and evaluation, improve the effectiveness of the projects being implemented in the rural areas, provide more access to information for the general population, and expand the advertisement campaign for these health issues in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The Government of Mongolia firml y believes in achieving greater health for the Mongolian people and greater development and prospe rity in the health sector through close cooperation with United Nations specialized agencie s, especially WHO and its Member countries. Thank you very much for your attention. Sir Liam DONALDSON (United Kingdom of Britain and N orthern Ireland): The leadership of WHO, as the world's foremost pub lic health body, is as important as ever. We need WHO if we are to minimize the risks to health from the global financial crisis and tackle the range of health security threats. A healthy populat ion is of course essential to prosperity, security and stability. In contrast, poor health does more than damage the economic and political viability of any one country - it is a threat to the economic and po litical interests of all countries. I would like to thank the Director-General for her continued leadership a nd her address that focused on the Millennium Development Goals. I believe that we have a real op portunity to make a difference this week in making progress towards achieving the Goals. We are pleased to hear of the progress that is bei ng made in reducing child mortality. But we need to strengthen our efforts. We want to ensure t hat every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe and every newborn child is healthy. We must work to gether to ensure all countries have effective health strategies and strong health systems in this regard. Each country must decide how to finance its own he alth system. We support the approach taken by some countries of making critical services free at the point of use for the poorest. This removes a significant barrier for poor people, especially wom en and children, in accessing health care when they need it most. It is one of the four pillars of the Global Consensus for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health launched during the United Nations General A ssembly in New York last September. We continue to support the Executive Board's resol ution to accelerate progress on Millennium Development Goal 4. And here I would like to highli ght the importance of the United Kingdom-led resolution on preventing and treating pneumonia, wh ich is coming up later on our agenda. Pneumonia kills more children than any other illness in the w orld and reducing deaths from pneumonia is crucial if we are to reach Millennium Development Goal 4. The busy agenda in front of us reminds us of the b readth of work that the WHO Secretariat and its Member States are engaged in - and I would like to pay tribute to the hard work and dedication of the staff. With resources becoming even tighter, it is important that WHO is able to prioritize its wo rk, and we very much welcome the consultation paper tha t the Director-General recently published, and look forward to playing our part in helping to deve lop this paper further and implementing it in due course. Thank you, Mr President. A63/VR/5 page 106 Dr PATSALIDES (Cyprus): Mr President, allow me to congratulate you and the Vice-Presidents on your election and convey my wishes for a successful and productive He alth Assembly. Mr President, Madam Director- General, distinguished colleagues, delegates, first of all, I would like to align myself with the statement made by the Spanish Presidency on behalf of the European Union. Our focus this year is particularly timely given t hat we are only five years away from the set target date for achieving the Millennium Developmen t Goals. The fact that the world is in the midst of an economic crisis makes it even more imperative to evaluate now the progress achieved towards that end and ensure that during our national and interna tional efforts to recover from the economic recession, we will not divert our attention from th e common commitment of achieving the Goals, no matter how difficult it might be. Health care and health-related issues were not lef t untouched by the crisis. Obviously, vulnerable groups are the first to be affected in s uch situations. Thus, special attention should be p aid to monitoring the social determinants of health and reducing health inequalities. Equal opportunities in access to health care are a priority and as such mu st be promoted through the increased cooperation of all actors involved at the local, national and inte rnational levels. After all, a healthy population i s both the way to achieve economic prosperity and a key fa ctor for development and economic growth. The way to achieve this is through establishing and mai ntaining effective health systems. We all know that in order to keep health systems on track a strong s ense of direction is necessary, combined with coherent investment in the various building blocks of the health system, so as to provide the kind of services that produce results. The economic recession is already affecting develo ping and less developed countries. WHO and the international community in general must be read y to provide maximum assistance to those in need with a view to reducing the impact of the recession on vulnerable populations. Promoting the health- related Millennium Development Goals is a vital pre requisite in efforts to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development, which in turn provides sta bility and above all healthy societies in all aspec ts. Indeed, some progress has been achieved in improvi ng children's nutrition and reducing child mortality, yet a lot more has to be done. In the sa me vein, a lot of work should be directed towards reducing the unacceptable levels of maternal mortal ity and improving women's and children's health in many countries. In this respect, Cyprus would li ke to welcome the WHO report, Women and health . More positive signs are to be observed in the effo rts to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases. The Government of Cyprus places high importance on this specific issue and pledged at the end of 2009, despite the challenges posed by the current economic crisis, to support UNITAID, an initiative the importance of which has already been mentioned by the keynote speaker, Her Excellency the President of Liberia. The Cyprio t support for UNITAID amounts to an annual contribution of \u20ac 400 000 for a period of six years , the largest-ever contribution committed to a specific development initiative by the Cypriot Gove rnment. At the same time, we do recognize that joint conce rted action and attention should be directed towards addressing the upward trend of noncommunica ble diseases, and we note with appreciation the priority given by the Director-General to this grow ing health burden. We hope that the action plan for the global strategy for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases will prove to be a constructive first step and that the effective impl ementation of the global strategy will provide an effective tool in combating these diseases. The last year could be described as a historic one with regard to international public health. We all had to face a common threat - a common challeng e. The outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has clearly indicated the leading role that WHO has to play in coordinating and managing the global response to health threats. We managed to overcome this crisis with good global cooperation under WHO's leadership. However, there are a lot of lesso ns to be learnt out of it. The pandemic has demonstrated the usefulness of the International He alth Regulations (2005) and provided an opportunity for assessing and evaluating their perf ormance in cases of emergencies. We thus welcome the respective initiative of the Director-General t o convene the Review Committee on the Functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005). The experience of the recent pandemic re-established A63/VR/5 page 107 that indeed viruses do not recognize borders and in this respect an effective response cannot be achieved without international cooperation. The Millennium Development Goals are mutually rein forcing and closely interconnected and interrelated. They are not a unilateral matter and they cannot be accomplished independently. Progress towards the attainment of the health-related Millen nium Development Goals directly affects, and is directly influenced by, progress in the whole frame work. International commitment and international cooperation were necessary prerequisites for agreei ng on the Goals back in 2000. Equally, and even more importantly, international commitment and inte rnational cooperation are necessary prerequisites for achieving them. The PRESIDENT: Thank you. I now give the floor to the delegate of Guyana, who will speak on behalf of the Caribbean Community. Dr RAMSAMMY (Guyana): Mr President, Director-General, colleagues, all. I t is good to be here again and see all of you. At this Sixty-third World Health Assembly, we do have much to be thankful for. We do agree with you, Director-General, that progress in human developmen t has taken place. There can be no doubt that we live longer lives. These can be no doubt that child ren are protected far more from many diseases than they were previously because we can almost guarante e children access to life-saving vaccines and medicines. There can be no doubt we have reduced ma ternal and child mortality. We agree that we ought to be thankful. But we cannot yet celebrate b ecause these achievements are uneven within countries and between countries. Equity has been pu rsued, but we are far from achieving equity in our world. There are still too many communities and too many countries where we are far from achieving longer lives and protecting our children. There are still too many children and poor people who are lacking life-saving medicines, life-saving interven tions and who are still undernourished. This Health Assembly is taking place at a time whe n the world system continues to wobble under one of the severest economic crises in histor y. The consequences are still quite severe especial ly for small developing countries, whose economies are subject to the vicissitudes of external trade and global financial systems that undermine the fabric of social and economic development. We urge that responses by developed countries and multilateral a id agencies to the present economic crisis do not repeat the mistakes of the past, highlighted by the type of structural adjustments for developing countries that led to health deterioration. It is f or this reason that on behalf of the 15 member coun tries of the Caribbean Community which I represent today, I commend the vision illuminated in the address of Dr Chan, WHO's Director-General, in the opening plenary. She highlighted the need for horizontal and vertical approaches, on placing emphasis on coh erence and complementarity of programmes, and on targeting the poor as primary beneficiaries of p ublic health services. We in the Caribbean Community fully endorse the clarion call for invest ing in public health to save lives. We do not make a distinction between health and development, and w e have pursued development from the perspective that health is wealth. As we approach the accountability date of 2015, th e focus of the Sixty-third World Health Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals is not only appropriate but pertinent to the intricate links between health and development, as articulate d in the Report of the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, endorsed by this Health Assembly seven years ago. A preliminary assessment of progress towards the implementation o f the Goals overall suggests that Member States of the Caribbean Community are on track to meet mos t of the targets, in particular the Millennium Development Goals 4, 5 and 6, which relate to healt h. The recent earthquake in Haiti does pose a tremend ous risk for Haiti and we urge that Haiti be provided with the support it needs to meet the Mill ennium Development Goals, together with her sister nations of the Caribbean Community. In spite of the Haiti setback, the Caribbean Community is proud of its achievement in further reducing child and ma ternal mortality and undernutrition. We are proud of the gains made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tu berculosis and malaria. A63/VR/5 page 108 One of the major reasons for the reduction in chil d mortality in our region is the proud record of universal access and coverage for life-saving vacci nes. Countries provide between 12 and 15 vaccines for children in our region today. Within the last t wo years, several countries have introduced rotavir us and pneumococcus vaccines, and several are now intr oducing human papillomavirus vaccines. We believe that vaccines for children must not be nego tiable and we share the concern of the Director- General regarding the withholding of vaccines from children because of the reckless doubts about vaccine safety. Countries of the Caribbean Communit y have pledged to follow a \"no child left behind\" policy for children's vaccines. The countries of the Caribbean Community are conce rned that, even as we make progress in combating several intractable and poverty-inducing public health scourges, there are others that are threatening to overwhelm us. One such threat is the growing pandemic of noncommunicable diseases. We are proud of the efforts within our region and w e appreciate the support from WHO and from other countries to ensure that the challenge of non communicable diseases is appropriately addressed. And now with leadership from the Caribbean, we are poised for a Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on noncommunicable disease s in September 2011. We urge that this opportunity be explored to ensure that a global ins trument is crafted for an effective response to noncommunicable diseases. Mr President and colleagues, we wish to also highl ight the great neglect that still characterizes the global response to mental illnesses. At the ver y least, more than 10% of the disease burden in our region is accounted for by mental illnesses. Global ly, WHO estimates a disease burden of more than 14% for mental illnesses. We commend the work of WH O in closing the mental health gap to assist in building capacity in developing countries. The countries of the Caribbean Community comprehen d the benefits of coherence and complementarity to which the Director-General refer red. It was after all the Community working with PAHO that became the first region in the world to e radicate smallpox, held the first summit of Heads of Government on the noncommunicable diseases in th e world, established the Pan Caribbean Partnership against HIV/AIDS (PANCAP), the first re gional network comprising governments, the private sector, nongovernmental organizations and i nternational partners in a network aimed at an accelerated approach to HIV/AIDS, which has been re cognized by the United Nations as an international best practice. It is a region that es tablished a CARICOM Single Market (CSM) in 2005 and is moving towards achieving a single market and economy by 2015. This is the flagship of our coherence as the Caribbean Community region. With the objective of coherence and complementarit y, the Member States of the Caribbean Community are engaged in transitioning five regiona l health institutions into one Caribbean Public Health Agency between 2010 and 2014. This enterpris e, referred to as CARPHA, will become fully functional one year ahead of 2015, the benchmark ye ar for the Millennium Development Goals. This is significant because it augurs well for providing the institutional framework to support the technic al and operational systems to guarantee the effective outcomes of the health-related Millennium Development Goals. The Caribbean Community has created a charter, the Charter for Cooperation in Health, the CCH. In the Nassau Declaration of 2001, the Heads o f Government established the Charter as an instrument for functional cooperation. What underscores initiatives such as CARPHA, PANCA P and CCH is the importance of establishing and building partnerships through func tional cooperation - regionally, in the hemisphere and internationally - to enhance human capacity, an d to mobilize resources to sustain these initiative s. We see functional cooperation as a necessary part o f development. In this regard, we are grateful for the support of the Canadian Public Health Agency in assisting us in establishing CARPHA, for the United States' Government and the President's Emerg ency Plan for AIDS Relief, for the efforts of Cuba to help build capacity for health-care deliver y. We are grateful for support received from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Irelan d, the European Union, the World Bank and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria . Such functional cooperation must be enhanced as ou r countries confront the severe human resource constraints in health. The Caribbean Commu nity joins our colleagues from Africa and other developing countries to urge for a more ethical rec ruitment practice by recipient countries for our A63/VR/5 page 109 nurses and other health-care providers, and we supp ort WHO in the development of a code of practice for recruitment of health-care providers. Moreover, the Caribbean Community is concerned abo ut the possibility that Round 10 for the Global Fund will be limited, and we are concerned a bout the restrictions being placed on middle- income countries. Finally, Mr President, while we were disappointed with the result from Copenhagen, WHO must continue to advocate for mitigation and adapta tion interventions in response to the real threats of climate change. This is another area where the Cari bbean is leading in advocacy and intervention. For example, Guyana's low-carbon strategy seeks to cont ribute to the adaptation programme of lowering carbon emissions. Guyana has been recognized for it s championing role, and Guyana's President has been awarded a United Nations Environment Programme 's Champions of the Earth Award for 2010. The Caribbean development agenda, colleagues, is p remised on the dream of long and productive lives for our citizens. We see functiona l cooperation with our sisters and brothers everywhere as the instrument to realize this dream. We see \"health is wealth\" as the basis for realizi ng this dream. Professor HOTINEANU (Republic of Moldova): Madam Director-General, ladies and gentlemen, in 2 003, the Republic of Moldova identified the measures to be undertaken for fulfilling the pr inciples of the Declaration and for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Also, defined were th e intermediate indicator levels to be achieved in 2006 and 2010. Indicator monitoring for infant mort ality demonstrates that starting with 2000, the level of this indicator in the Republic of Moldova fell by 33.8%, constituting 12.1 cases per 1000 newborns in 2009. Thus, the Republic of Moldov a had already achieved the goals for 2010 in 2008. The mortality rate for children under five decreas ed by 38.3% during the period 2000-2009 and for the last four consecutive years has constituted about 14 cases per 1000 newborns. However, to achieve the 2015 goal, we still need to improve the quality of cooperation with other social partners (e.g. local authorities and social services). The l evel of maternal mortality in the Republic of Moldo va over the last 10 years displays a sinusoidal curve. For the period 2000-2009, the number of childbirth s under a qualified medical personnel's supervision c onstituted more than 99%. One of the reasons for the high level and unstable character of maternal m ortality is the social factor, including late visit s to a doctor determined by the migratory character of wom en's life as well as their work abroad. Monitoring of indicators for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals relating to mother and child health reveals the risks that negatively impact the measures for achieving the Goals. These risks are as follows: the worsening situation relat ed to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and the consequences of the world financial crisis. Despite the fact that the Republic of Moldova has taken a number of measures to improve control of HIV/AIDS morbidity and the tuberculosis mortality level, there has been an increase of these indicators' level. Thus, starting with 2000, the level of HIV/AIDS morbidity increased by 3.3 times, so achieving the goal of 9.6 cases per 1 00 000 of population by 2010 appears unrealistic. There is no evidence pointing to a positive trend w ith a decline in the tuberculosis mortality level. In 2009, this indicator constituted 17.9 cases per 100 000 of population. One of the burning issues of tuberculosis control is the high level of multidrug -resistant tuberculosis. In 2009, it accounted for 42.97% of the overall number of tuberculosis patien ts. The Republic of Moldova is taking concrete measure s to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. In 2010, it initiated the development of nat ional programmes for 2011-2015, such as the National Immunization Programme and National Progra mmes on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis prevention and control. However, without external s upport, particularly in the conditions of the economic crisis, our country will hardly achieve th e Millennium Development Goals. In this respect the assistance offered by WHO, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and other external partners for development is especially app reciated. Thank you for your attention. A63/VR/5 page 110 M.

For a country in transition, it is of the utmost importance to place its activities on the public sector reform, includ ing that of the health sector, within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals. This is the case of Serbia. At the very outset, let me state clearly that the major issue identified through a critical analysis was the lagging behind of vulnerable groups, such a s the poor, the refugees and the Roma, especially Roma internally displaced from Kosovo Province sinc e 1999. The estimated mortality rate of the Roma population in camps in North Mitrovica and its surroundings was much higher than the average. We are most grateful to WHO which, since 2005 has p rovided continued support for improving the situation, and setting up and maintaining specific health interventions to the affected Roma populatio n. Among other concerns, it should be noted that impo rtant progress has been made in the reduction of child mortality, leading to a further expected drop to halve it by 2015. Furthermore, our efforts continue to focus on neonatal and perinatal care. In terms of maternal health, good progress was achieved as well. The Millennium Development Go al framework was used to set up additional national targets as regards child health, and speci fically the health of Roma children. Significant progress was made in HIV/AIDS and tube rculosis control. As regards the former, Serbia is now implementing the third project funded by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and has refined the national strategy, targeting primarily groups at risk, marginalized an d difficult-to-reach populations. Similarly, the clos e cooperation between WHO and Serbia for tuberculosis control and the financial support prov ided by the Global Fund resulted in an effective reduction of the tuberculosis incidence rate from 3 7 per 100 000 population in 2003 to 24 per 100 000 population in 2009. A63/VR/5 page 115 Even though national averages for children's and w omen's health have improved markedly, there are still significant differences within the nation al territory as well as among socioeconomic groups - the worst situation being that of the Roma population. Serbia is responding to this challenge by adopting a specific \"Action Plan for Roma Health\" congruent wi th other sectoral action plans, such as those for employment, education and housing. A National Confe rence on Roma Health was held in December 2009, in conjunction with WHO, advancing the effort s to address health challenges and to streamline al l relevant sectors within the same set of goals withi n the Millennium Development Goal framework. Needless to say, the achievement of the health-rel ated Millennium Development Goals is closely linked with a strong health system, good go vernance and management, human resources, good quality of services delivered and appropriate fundi ng of health services that will ensure that all tho se in need receive appropriate health promotion, preventa tive, curative and rehabilitative care services. Bu t, the health-related Goals are to a large extent also related to other Millennium Development Goals such as those for poverty reduction, gender equality and empowerment of women. We welcome the adoption by the United Nations Gene ral Assembly of a resolution on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, which seeks to convene a high-level meeting on the prevention and control of noncommunicable disea ses in September 2011 with the participation of Heads of States and Government. It will be a valuab le contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Allow me to thank WHO and other international part ners such as UNICEF, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the European Union fo r the support provided to Serbia in strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Healt h and of the entire Government to perform effectively their stewardship functions. As a globa l community, we need to ensure continued commitment and funding for the achievement of the M illennium Development Goals in a holistic manner, geographically, politically and health-wise . Serbia is contributing to and participating in th is common endeavour, and will continue to do so. I tha nk you. Le Professeur HASSAN (Niger): Monsieur Bureau.

This Health Assembly i s taking place as we prepare ourselves for the last five-year lap in the time frame to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Jamaica supports resolution EB126.R4 and especially the calls to str engthen health systems to deliver equitable health outcomes, reflect health equity in all national pol icies and to reaffirm the values and principles of primary health care. We look forward to the continu ed leadership of the Director-General in supporting the work of small and developing nations to retain our health workers who are indispensable to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. This Health Assembly is being held at a time of re newed optimism and hope for a global recovery from what has been a most devastating fina ncial crisis. The challenge that confronts us as leaders is how to move forward without leaving smal l and vulnerable States behind. The health sectors in many developing countries are struggling to cope with high disease burdens, weak health systems, migration of critical health workers to developed c ountries, and underinvestment in health. These challenges present extraordinary obstacles to the g rowth and development of these countries and undermine the achievement of the Millennium Develop ment Goals within the specified time frames. Jamaica, for its part, has achieved mixed results in the attainment of the health-related Millennium Development Goals. Jamaica is on track t o achieve universal access to reproductive health and to halt and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS, mal aria and tuberculosis. In respect of Goal 6 on combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, Jam aica has surpassed the target for school attendance among orphans and non-orphans in the 10- 14 age group. Between 2004 and 2008, there was a 17% reduction in the number of persons with A IDS and a 40% reduction in the number of AIDS-related deaths. The HIV prevalence rate for th e 15-24 age group declined by just over 1% in the last decade. Access to antiretroviral drugs is, at 49%, far below the national target of 75% that was set for 2009. Slow progress is being made in the reduction of ma ternal and child mortality. Reported maternal mortality has declined from 120 per 100 000 to almo st 95 per 100 000. Reports over various time periods using other methodologies show different fi gures. We agree with the observation that there is a need for better data collection systems to improve confidence in comparative analyses over time and between countries. The proportion of births attende d by skilled health personnel has increased from 81% to 93%. Infant and child mortality rates are 21 and 25 per 1000 live births, respectively, compared to 25 and 28 per 1000 live births 10 years ago. After a decade of slippage in immunization coverage, Jamaica achieved outstanding results last year of 90% coverage, up from an average of 83% over the previous 10 years. The significance of thi s achievement must be viewed within the context of an environment of declining budgets and the continu ed migration of our skilled workers. Jamaica remains committed to the lofty Development Goals of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. We have incorporated these Goals in ou r national policies and in particular Vision 2030, our National Development Plan. Having regard to our weak economy and the likely impact on the number of persons who could become medically indige nt, the Government took the bold move of eliminating user fees in April 2008. The eliminatio n of user fees has resulted in an increase in patie nt utilization at both the primary and secondary care levels; pharmacy services experienced the highest level of increase at 44% over the period. The drug budget has increased by 100% over the same period. Jamaica's experience is worthy of some cons ideration in light of Target 8e, which addresses access to affordable and quality essential drugs in developing countries. I urge this Health Assembly and our partners in developed countries to bring re solute leadership to bear on Goal 8. The shift in t he disease profile of developing countries, the ageing population and the high incidence of chronic noncommunicable diseases demand immediate and urgen t attention as far as access to affordable drugs is concerned. As we move into the last five-year lap of the Mill ennium Declaration, I am recommending the following: first, countries should be supported in strengthening data collection and health informatio n A63/VR/5 page 119 systems; secondly, consideration should be given to including chronic noncommunicable diseases in the Millennium Development Goals, in keeping with o ur recommendation to the United Nations Economic and Social Council's Annual Ministerial Re view last year (we are heartened by the fact that the United Nations resolution on noncommunicable di seases has been adopted); and thirdly, WHO should seek avenues to collaborate more effectively with partners to ensure that developmental support is increased and equitably distributed acro ss countries, including middle-income countries now made more vulnerable as a result of the global financial crisis. Jamaica looks forward to the outcome of this Health Assembly. Thank you. Mr CAMILLERI (Malta): Mr Chairman, on behalf of the Maltese delegation, I wish to congratulate you on your election to the Presidency of this Sixty-third World Health Assembly. I would also like to take this opportunit y to congratulate Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab on her recent ap pointment as Regional Director for the European Region. As declared by our Minister on Health, the Elderly and Community Care during Dr Jakab's first official visit to Malta last month, Malta ful ly supports her declared policy direction for the R egion and commits itself to supporting her in the challen ging task ahead. Health over the past years has been facing a numbe r of serious challenges. In her address to the Sixty-first World Health Assembly two years ago, th e Director-General presented three major threats to health, namely: food security, climate change an d the influenza pandemic. The influenza pandemic caused by the pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus was kinder to us than we anticipated. While causing relatively mild health problems, it has led to the development of a number of challenges and criticisms to the response to the infection by the WHO Secretariat and Member States. Although the pandemic is not yet over, Malta feels that a thorou gh evaluation of our response to the threat as well as a risk assessment of other potential threats are cr ucial. Over recent years, there has been a significantly increased awareness of the effects of climate change. Malta feels that not enough emphasis has be en placed on the impact of this phenomenon on the health of our people. Malta therefore urges WHO to address this issue in a global, concerted manner and to work towards putting health high on t he agenda of the climate change initiative. Malta recently finalized and published a study on the lik ely effects of climate change on the country, and w e will be working towards addressing the issues raise d by this study. When mentioning serious challenges facing the heal th sector, one cannot ignore the financial crisis that has hit the globe over the past 18 mont hs or so. This has had a major impact on countries' ability to provide for health. The reduction in bud getary allocations, and the social impact of rising unemployment have had a major impact on our capacit y for addressing the social determinants of health. It is the most vulnerable that have borne t he brunt of these effects, and our efforts in what is now being regarded as the recovery phase of the cri sis must be focused in favour of these groups. If we want to effectively address these serious issues , we all need to make a concerted effort to maximiz e our contribution, under WHO's leadership, to the ac hievement of the Millennium Development Goals. This can only be achieved if we strongly believe th at money spent on health is an investment for wealth. Malta echoes what was stated earlier by Spain on b ehalf of the members of the European Union, in that we believe in the leading role of WHO in ad dressing the tasks before us, and fully support the role and nature of WHO's core business in the rapid ly changing global health environment. Within the context of sustainability, Malta also supports the initiative being taken by WHO to establish a global code of practice for the recruitment of health pers onnel. This Health Assembly will once again be addressing issues relating to both communicable and noncommunicable diseases. Malta is supportive of th e initiatives to address communicable diseases like HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, malaria and tuberculosis as well as the eradication of measles. Over the pas t years, Malta has seen a steady increase in the inci dence of HIV and tuberculosis, primarily due to the arrival of irregular migrants on our shores. Malta feels that more emphasis should be placed on the implementation of the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable D iseases in order to effectively address the major burden in both developed and developing countries. Only last week, Malta launched a new National A63/VR/5 page 120 Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Noncommu nicable Diseases, setting targets for reduction in a number of risk factors and a reduction in morbidi ty and mortality from a number of diseases by 2020. We are currently also working on a National A ction Plan for Cancer and a National Strategy to address our obesity problem. In conclusion, I wish to underline Malta's continu ing strong support for all the efforts and initiatives being made by WHO, and our commitment t o contribute to endeavours to ensure the success of this Health Assembly. que son por las cuales pa revoluci\u00f3n social que U n trabajo de la FAO y la CEPAL nos dice que en Nicaragua en el 2004 el costo del hambre significab perdidos tener desnutrici\u00f3n veces mayor en los s pobres que los del primer quintil poblaci\u00f3n. sanitaria a un m\u00e1s amplio que hay que dar acceso a la mayor\u00eda de la poblaci\u00f3n a la atenci\u00f3n primaria.

Dr TENAUA (Kiribati): Mr President, honourable ministers, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Pacific island nations - Cook Islands, Fiji, Fe derated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau T onga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and my own country, Kiribati - I would like to extend our warmest greet ings. Mr President, I congratulate you on the post you have assumed, and would like to take this oppor tunity to assure you of our dedication and support. Let me take this opportunity to acknowledge that, the Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, has demonstrated strong leadership and guidance tha t have taken us through these challenging times - pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and meeting our commitments to the Millennium Development Goals in the face of the global financial crisis. To our Regiona l Director, Dr Shin Young-soo, we thank you for your commitment to improving health in the Pacific. We all know that each year brings its quota of hea lth problems, some of them new and some of them old ones which refuse to go away. Unfortunatel y, in the Pacific, we have had our fair share of health challenges over the years. Many of these hav e been raised by fellow health ministers of the Pacific island countries in their statements to the Health Assembly in previous years. At the mention of the Pacific, most people think of sandy beaches, markets stalls heavy with fruit and vegetables, se as teeming with fish, and happy, smiling people. Very few think of food crisis. And yet that is what is happening right now. Food security is threatened in many ways: declines in traditional food crops and fishing; increased dependence on imported foods; gr owing vulnerability to climate change; volatility in international commodity prices; and challenges t o enact and enforce food safety and quality standards. Collectively, these and other threats ar e contributing to greater risks of noncommunicable diseases, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and foo d diseases in Pacific populations. Malnutrition, chronic obesity, worrying levels of diabetes - thes e are the everyday realities of life in the Pacific islands. Noncommunicable diseases have now reached epidemic proportions and are the leading cause of death in our Region. Another huge challenge we face is that of climate change. Climate change figures prominently on the agenda of our meetings in the Pacific and in the Region - and that is not surprising as many Pacific islanders live in coastal zones and atolls that are susceptible to storm surges, coastal erosi on, flooding, droughts, high tides and salt-water intru sion. Many countries in the Pacific are literally a t risk of disappearing within the foreseeable future. The drivers of climate change are not the small islands of the Pacific, however. We cannot prevent these problems on our own, but only if we work with our neighbours and other countries across the globe. The public health challenges facing us are beyond the capacity of any of us to address on our own. They are beyond the capacity of the health sec tor to address on its own. But if we stand together , if we work across the health, trade, agriculture, e ducation and other sectors, we can make real A63/VR/5 page 123 progress. The Millennium Development Goals are an e xcellent example of this. The health-related Goals are so closely linked to all the others that these Goals cannot be viewed in isolation. Freedom from poverty and hunger, access to education and ge nder equality are important determinants of health and maternal, newborn and child health. The health services science required to address the challenges posed by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria and pro tect maternal and child health are well known. The Pacific island countries recognize and value th e role of breastfeeding for child nutrition and development, particularly in times of crisis and di sasters. However, making these services available and accessible to the people who need them requires robust and equitable health systems. These must be integrated into society as a whole. There must b e basic transport and communications networks to support them. And people must be educated as to how to access and use them. However, the above conditions are not necessarily present in all Pacific island countries. Let us take the case of maternal and child health. All cou ntries have been delivering maternal, child and adolescent health services, though at varying degre es. While targets for Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 have been met by many Pacific island countries, some still report high maternal mortality ratios. For example, in Papua New Guinea, trends indicate that some targets under the Goals may be challenging to meet. However, the country is taking immediate and urgent action to scale up maternal and child health services. We continue to pay close attention and monitor progress of these two Goals. Nonetheless, it is not all bad news. I am very ple ased to be able to present to you the example of the Pacific islands in acting together to address o ur common concerns. In November 2008, 15 health ministers signed the Pacific Policy Framework for A chieving Universal Access to Reproductive Health Services and Commodities 2008-2015. This pre sents an important opportunity to move forward to translate this policy framework into nat ional plans for actions. In July of last year, we m et in Madang, Papua New Guinea at the eighth Meeting o f Ministers of Health for the Pacific Island Countries. The Madang Commitment set out a series o f bold actions designed to boost interventions to address several critical issues, including maternal and child health, the growing noncommunicable disease burden, human resources for health, health systems, and HIV/AIDS among others. We reaffirmed primary health care, which has been, and continues to be, an organizing principle for strengthening our health systems, and the Health Is lands Approach as a model of a holistic approach to achieving our goal of protecting and promoting heal th in the Pacific. In April of this year, Vanuatu hosted the first-ever Pacific Food Summit to define our common strategy to combat many of the threats to attaining the Millennium Development Goa ls, such as malnutrition, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and the increasing epidemic of noncom municable diseases. The Summit brought together Government officials from health, trade and agricul ture ministries, as well as partners in internation al and regional organizations, development agencies, c onsumers, the food industry, and a number of other sectors. Finally, a few days ago, we gathered here in Geneva for the first Healthy Islands Forum . The Forum was established as part of the Pacific is land countries' effort to strengthen health systems through primary health care and health promotion by revitalizing the Healthy Islands approach. We learnt many valuable lessons from the rich experien ce in the Pacific, which helped us to understand more fully how truly achieving public health goals would require consistent and strong leadership from senior levels of Government down to engagement and ownership at community levels. We shared good practices for, and practical examples o f, delivering concrete actions in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and in response to the increasing threats and burdens due to the rise in noncommunicable diseases and other lifestyle-relate d issues. Mr President, in the Pacific we are well aware of the complex challenges we face, and we are united to address them. But to achieve the Millenni um Development Goals, we will need to work even more broadly. We fully acknowledge and are forever grateful to our partners who have generously supported us in our efforts to improve the health o f our people. The challenges may be great but together we will achieve great things. We thank you for all we have achieved to date, and we look forward to even greater gains. Thank you very much. A63/VR/5 page 124 Dr Sezibera (Rwanda), Vice-President, took the pres idential chair. Le Dr Sezibera (Rwanda), Vice-Pr\u00e9sident, assume Mr CHAUDHARY (Nepal): Mr Vice-President, Madam Director-General, honoura ble Ministers, distinguished delegates, I feel honoured to represent the Government of Nepal at this Sixty-third World Health Assembly. Let me congratulate you, Mr President, on your election to the Presidency of this Health Assembly. I pledge the full support of my delegation and expres s confidence that your leadership will guide this Health Assembly towards a successful conclusion. I would like to congratulate Director-General, Madam Margaret Chan, on her leadership of the Organ ization in this challenging time, and express appreciation for her commitment to work for equitab le access to quality health. The theme of this Health Assembly has special rele vance as we look forward to the Review Conference on the status of the Millennium Developm ent Goals later this year. In 2000, when our leaders endorsed a framework for the development in the form of the Millennium Development Goals, they sent a message that we are one world and our d evelopment agenda is interconnected. We are fully conscious of our responsibilities in providing equi table health access to our people. Nepal has developed and implemented health-related plans, pol icies and programmes. The existing Second Long-Term Health Plan prepared with WHO's assistanc e aims at guiding health sector development for improving the health of our people, particularl y those whose health needs are often not met. Nepal has placed priority on public health. Government ex penditure on public health has increased threefold in the last five years. Nepal signed the Internatio nal Partnership for Health Global Compact in 2007, with a view to ensuring predictable funding and aid effectiveness in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals and the principles contained in t he Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Nepal has made significant progress in the direction of a chieving the goal on reducing child mortality. Despite several pressing challenges at hand, we are also on the right track to meeting the target on maternal mortality with a remarkable decline in mat ernal deaths. We have been able to halt and reverse the trend of malaria and tuberculosis. Howe ver, in the face of the challenges posed by HIV/AIDS transmission through migrant workers, we n eed to put additional efforts in reaching this particular target. Recent studies have shown that least developed cou ntries stand at a high risk of not meeting the Millennium Development Goals. Countries emerging fr om conflict and those with weak governance are at even higher risk. The Goals are interrelated and cannot be realized without improving the healt h status of the poorest and most vulnerable people, w ho are confronting extreme poverty, deprivation, malnutrition, and other health risks on a daily bas is. We need to work together in reducing the advers e effects of climate change on the health sector, enh ancing the health information system, expanding research on health issues and ensuring access to he alth facilities. As the Chair of the Least Developed Countries Grou p, Nepal strongly appeals to the international community for a scaled-up, strong and sustained level of international assistance in a comprehensive manner for the attainment of the heal th-related Millennium Development Goals. The financial crisis of the past few years has adv ersely affected the national health of developed, developing and least developed countries. The outbr eaks of deadly infectious diseases demand that we work collectively to address the challenges of heal th in relation to poverty, sanitation, education an d environment. I express the commitment of my Governm ent to work together with WHO at the national, regional and international levels in prom oting equitable access to health care and to make universal health access a reality. Thank you all fo r your kind attention. Professor VONGVICHIT (Lao People's Democratic Repub lic): Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, on beh alf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, allow us to express our warm g reetings to the Sixty-third World Health Assembly. On this auspicious occasion, let us expre ss our sincere congratulations to the President and the Vice-Presidents on their elections, and we do b elieve that under their wise leadership, the Sixty- third World Health Assembly will meet with great su ccess. I am very pleased that the topic of the A63/VR/5 page 125 health-related Millennium Development Goals was cho sen for this meeting, which is timely and relevant to the context of the development and heal th situation of our country. In fact, the Lao People's Democratic Republic is a tropical country, which is always exposed to the great risks of communicable diseases. At the sa me time, noncommunicable diseases are also on the rise. Currently, we are in the final year of the im plementation of the Sixth National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2006-2010), aiming at lifting our nation out of least developed status by the year 2020. In this Plan, the health-sector contribution to poverty alleviation consists of ensuring a nationwide health service that is fair and does not discriminate on the basis of gender, age, sex, soc ial rank, tradition, religion, ethnicity or geographic location. Health goals are access and quality; at t he same time, the health service is also focusing on p revention. Based on the main achievements and challenges from the implementation of the previous National Socio-Economic Development Plan, the Lao Government has planned to achieve the health-re lated Millennium Development Goals. In fact, child mortality and maternal mortality ra tes are still high in Lao People's Democratic Republic. Every year, hundreds of children in Laos die from preventable causes: illnesses caused by contaminated water, inadequate immunization, injury from unexploded ordinance, high levels of poverty and malnutrition, malaria and tuberculosis. Regarding maternal health, despite considerable improvements in the quality of life over the past t wo decades, the general health status of the Lao population remains low, particularly for rural comm unities, and women continue to experience inadequate levels of care in pregnancy and childbir th. Therefore the Lao Government will do its utmost to reduce child and maternal mortality rates by improving living conditions, increasing the immunization rate, ensuring access to safe drinking -water and safe sanitation facilities and increasin g women's delivery rate with midwifery attendance. The combat against HIV/AIDS, malaria and other dis eases is also one of our priorities. HIV/AIDS prevalence is still low in Lao People's De mocratic Republic, with an estimated adult HIV rate of around 0.06%. There are, however, several r isk factors that make the country particularly vulnerable. Half of all new HIV infections are amon g people aged between 15 and 24 years. By infecting young people disproportionately, the epid emic undermines local and international stability. We understand that to achieve the Millennium Devel opment Goals, more investment, particularly in the quality of services and better management of health systems, is needed. Lao People's Democratic Republic is committed to workin g to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and we are aware that international assistanc e and collaboration are extremely necessary. We are also confident that with our commitment and wit h the support of international agencies, we will successfully achieve the Goals. On this occasion, o n behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, I would like to express my gra titude and appreciation to WHO and all development partners for their valuable assistance extended to our country. Finally, I wish the Sixty- third World Health Assembly every success. Thank yo u very much.

La vigilancia HABER (Poland): Mr Vice-President, excellencies, ladies and gentle men, I am honoured to address the Sixty-third World Health Assembly on behalf of the Government o f the Republic of Poland. Poland fully aligns itself with the statement delivered by the distingu ished representative of Spain on behalf of the European Union. This year, the international commun ity is summing up 10 years of the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, designed to attain sustainable development on a global scale. After the first decade of the twent y-first century, health has more than ever become a serious global challenge. The emergence of new epid emiological threats fuelled by the process of A63/VR/5 page 127 growing migration has proved that common efforts by the international community are the only way to tackle global health issues. The concern of the int ernational community over the health of the most vulnerable groups, namely children and women, as we ll as over the threat of communicable diseases, was reflected in the elaboration of the three healt h-related Millennium Development Goals. While focusing on the health-related Goals, we have to pa y special attention to the interdependence between health and poverty, nutrition and access to clean a nd safe water and sanitation. In view of attaining the best possible living conditions, including health, it is necessary to create a transparent and efficie nt health system, which is able to deliver treatment a nd implement effective prevention programmes. While focusing on health issues in the internation al development agenda, let me speak briefly on Poland's experience over the past 20 years. The challenging transformation Poland has implemented since 1989 has primarily concerned very profound economic reforms, although special attention has been paid to reforms of health-care s ystems and the introduction of patient-oriented policies. The Polish Government has prioritized sys tematic improvement of the quality of medical services provided to children and women, particular ly during pregnancy, and spares no effort in tackling communicable and noncommunicable diseases. Poland has introduced reforms designed to abandon the centralized model and transfer management of the health-care system and ownership of medical facilities to local government bodies, combined with the introduction of universal medical insurance. The process of systemic change coincided with the enhancement of the status of phy sicians providing basic medical care. At this point , let me emphasize Poland's readiness to share its ex pertise with the developing countries and countries in transition. One of the priorities of Poland's gr owing development assistance is the sharing of expertise which Poland has acquired during its syst emic transformations, also in the area of health care. The effective suppression of communicable diseases has been the greatest achievement of Polish public services over the last 50 years. Our success was attained though an overall improvement of hygienic standards, upgrading of hospital hygien e, development of water mains and sewage systems, development and broad use of antibiotics a nd antiviral drugs, and mass vaccination programmes. Mass vaccination constitutes the most e ffective example of a public health intervention, producing rapid impacts in the form of health care and a reduction in disease incidence. With reference to communicable diseases, I wish to menti on the efforts of the Polish Government in countering HIV/AIDS. The Polish strategy of fightin g HIV/AIDS has been based on respect for human dignity and human rights. Ensuring equal acce ss to prevention, treatment and support for the most vulnerable groups is one of the main goals of the Polish Government's strategy. This has resulted in a systematic improvement in the quality of life of persons infected with HIV and suffering from AIDS, as well as enhanced public awareness of the p roblem. Poland is involved in the implementation of a grow ing number of projects in partnership with other countries, particularly with our neighbours. Health care for pregnant women and children is one of the highest priorities of the Polish Government in the health-care area. The main task here is to ensure a proper course for pregnancy and the earlie st possible identification of risk factors, making it possible to provide the appropriate assistance. The infant mortality rate has been falling for the pas t 20 years; last year, it amounted to 5.6 per 1000 li ve births - a sharp drop from 19.3 in 1990. Medical care in the perinatal period has the objective of e nsuring good health of the mother and child with th e lowest possible level of medical intervention, thou gh with observance of the relevant safety rules. Safety in this case means care based on proven prac tices, minimizing risk and error and providing support for the physiological aspect of birth. We are full engaged in implementation of the Mille nnium Development Goals, particularly the health-related Goals. Poland believes that sharing best practices from reforms implemented at national level during 20 years of transformation can make a valuable contribution to global health. Thank you for your attention. A63/VR/5 page 128 Dr KOMBA KONO (Sierra Leone): Mr Vice-President, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate you and your entire team on your election. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Dr Chan for upholding the image of our beautiful organization, the World Health Organizati on. Sierra Leone is in step with the rest of the world as it attempts to reform its health-care system. The Government has identified cost as the biggest b arrier to accessing health care in the country. Pregnant and breastfeeding women and young children are by far the largest groups in need of health services, and yet are often excluded from them by c ost of referral to health facilities when it is too late. With this major change in policy, the Government an d its development partners have removed this barrier, paving the way for greater use of and earl ier referral to health services. Moreover, the syst emic changes that this new policy will bring about withi n the provision of health care will produce a stronger, more efficient and effective health servi ce for all Sierra Leoneans. The alarmingly high maternal mortality ratio of 85 7 per 100 000 calls for an urgent response from a reformed health care system that works to re duce this high death rate of mothers and children by providing free health services to this fragile p opulation group. It ensures accessibility to health facilities. The present under-five mortality rate o f 140 per 1000 is unacceptable and calls for urgent action and commitment to reverse the tide. With thi s new initiative, pregnant women, lactating mothers and children under five are guaranteed elim ination of all user fees in the health facilities within the country. The policy ensures that all med ical care to the beneficiary group I have named - that is, pregnant women, lactating mothers and chil dren under five - will be provided free of charge. National awareness and response to this initiative of free health service for pregnant women, lactatin g mothers and children under five nationwide is reass uring: it reflects an attitude of responsibility fo r the social welfare of our more vulnerable groups. I am also proud to remark on the increasing response and concern of all health workers nationwide to the initiative and their willingness to make it work. The support of health development partners has been outstanding. They have not only adopted the agenda for change - they promote it, enhance it and work commendably with the administration in districts and towns to improve conditions of servic e where necessary, ensure sufficient drug supplies, improved care, and as the year unfolds, renovation and upgrading of health facilities and maternity an d paediatric wards in Government hospitals. Under the leadership of President Ernest Bai Koroma, the entire population of Sierra Leone accepts the free health-care initiative. The initiative conforms wit h the President's clarion call for behaviour and atti tudinal change. In concluding, I wish to state that President Koroma's dream for Sierra Leone is to ens ure that every child is given a chance to reach adulthood and contribute meaningfully to national d evelopment. For mothers, President Koroma's dream is to ensure that pregnancy and childbearing brings joy to families. Let me conclude by saying that happiness is considered an index of developmen t. Therefore a happy mother and child in Sierra Leone makes it a happy nation. Dr JAMEEL (Maldives): It gives me great pleasure and deep honour to make a statement on behalf of my country at this Health Assembly. My delegation and I bring greeting s from the Maldives to all present here. It has been 10 years since we adopted the United Nations M illennium Development Goals. We have no time to lose. We have only five more years to go. Today, in terms of per capita gross domestic produ ct, the Maldives is one of the richest countries in the region. However, as we emerge from a period of gross mismanagement of our limited financial resources, the present Government is face d with huge challenges and the daunting task of having to deal with huge fiscal and budgetary chall enges. Added to this, we know that 2004 brought the tsunami, and we lost about 80% of our gross dom estic product. Once again, as the world economic crisis threatens to engulf all nations of the world , our helplessness is further aggravated by the negative effects of the rapidly changing climatic c onditions, global warming and the sea level rise. Despite several challenges, we have achieved almost all the Millennium Development Goals. The Maldives has already achieved Goal 1, but there is growing income disparity between the urban and the rural population. Poverty dynamics analysis als o showed that many in the non-poor fell back into A63/VR/5 page 129 poverty and that there is a rise in unemployment am ong young people. Although we can achieve Goal 2 in time, in halving the proportion of people with hunger, we are faced with the challenge of promoting locally grown food and change the dietary habits of our people. Malnutrition in children is still a public health issue in the Maldives, althou gh a decline is seen in the proportion of underweig ht, stunting and wasting in children below five years. We have achieved Goal 3 in achieving universal access to primary education, and we are proud to no te that our literacy rate of 98 is one of the highe st in the world. There is little discrepancy in gender up to secondary education. However, education participation in tertiary level for females varies. Goal 4, to eliminate gender disparity, still needs concerted effort, but today we find that more and m ore women are engaged in decision-making and even in politics. Goal 5 of a two-thirds reduction of the under-five mortality rate, was already achie ved in 2005. However while reducing the maternal mortal ity rate is on track, accessibility to obstetric ca re and early detection of high-risk cases in the outer islands are issues that need to be addressed urgen tly and with new strategies. We have been able to contain the low prevalence of HIV/AIDS. But the high prevalence of drug use among youth and the increasing use of needles a mong them is of great concern in maintaining the low prevalence of HIV/AIDS. The Maldives has remain ed a malaria-free country since 1984 and no indigenous cases have been reported since then. The Maldives remains a tuberculosis low-prevalence country, but the few cases of multidrug-resistance need greater attention. Childhood tuberculosis is considered to be at zero prevalence, which may be l inked to almost universal coverage of BCG vaccination in the country. We have maintained our stand in ensuring environme ntally sustainable economic development. We realize that we are among the most vulnerable to climate change. To strengthen our convictions, the Maldives has unveiled a plan to make our countr y carbon-neutral within a decade. The impacts of climate change are already evident and are affectin g the livelihood of the people. Hence the Maldives has led an international initiative to realign this conceptual framework by shifting the world's focus onto the human and social dimensions of climate cha nge. As the honourable Minister from Kiribati said, small island nations are threatened by climat e change and international organizations such as WHO should be giving more focus to the small island States. In developmental efforts, the Government is aspiri ng to engage private parties in all aspects, including health care. We strongly believe that the social needs of people cannot be left to the marke ts, yet we need to engage if we are to have sustainabil ity. Our lifestyles are changing, and as in other countries, noncommunicable diseases are increasing. We also have an acute shortage of manpower but we are progressing well with our Millennium Develop ment Goals. We need to strengthen our alliances and support national efforts to move ahead. Buildin g alliances means reaching out to every institution , including civil society. We would like to urge the Director-General, as I m entioned earlier, to have a special forum for small island nations to discuss the health issues s pecific to these countries. I thank you for your ki nd attention. Mrs HANJAM SOARES (Timor-Leste): I would like to congratulate the President of the Sixty-third World Health Assembly, the Vice-Presidents and the Chairman of the Committees. I extend my deepest appreciation for the achievements of Madam Director-General. Honourable Ministers and delegates, representatives of international organizations, ladies and gentlemen, Timor-Leste is a young nation with a population of only one million, and is celebrating its eighth yea r of restoration of independence this week on 20 May 2010. Seven years have passed since the Timo r-Leste Demographic Health Survey in 2003, which showed the country as having a very low profi le of health and social indicators. Maternal mortality was the highest in the world at 800/100 0 00 live births; infant mortality was 83 deaths per 1000 live births; 49% of our children were reported as malnourished - all these indicators were very low when compared with other countries of the regio n. Health infrastructure was also very poor, and the numbers of health workforce were so limited wit h less than 50 general physicians. Today, my country considers health as a high prior ity, the Third National Priority in 2010, and many efforts are being made to overcome health and development challenges. The re-establishment of A63/VR/5 page 130 health services, the development of basic infrastru cture, National Priority No.1 (water and sanitation , human resources development and the strengthening o f support systems) have been considered the main priorities during the first phase of improveme nt. With a total of more than 500 Timorese medical doctors graduating by 2013 and an increase in new u ndergraduate nurses, midwives and other auxiliary health professionals, the focus has moved now to expanding access and quality of services for both primary health care and hospital care into the second phase. The IVth Constitutional Government has led the development of a long-term n ational strategic plan where people are the main focus, and the Ministry of Health is using the oppo rtunity to accomplish the necessary development for the sector to improve health and well-being, us ing the Millennium Development Goals as a guide. To make progress towards the Goals, the priority f ocus is now on interventions to reduce maternal and child mortality rates, improve the nut ritional status of the population and reduce mortality rates caused by diseases such as diarrhoe a, malaria, dengue, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. That is why in 2008, the Ministry of Health of Timo r-Leste introduced a new approach to health services delivery focusing on community participati on and empowerment in health. SISCa, the Integrated Community Health Service, is a preventiv e care-focused service with special attention to vulnerable groups such as mothers, children, the di sabled and the elderly. The preliminary result of the Timor-Leste Demograp hic Health Survey from 2009 has indicated significant progress, including a 30% decline in un der-five mortality since 2003 with 64 deaths/1000 live births, a 26% decline in fertility since 2003 from 7.8 to 5.7 births/woman; and basic child immunization rates have increased from 35% to 53%, while other key areas such as nutrition need more investment with nearly one in two children (45 %) underweight. At the institutional level, reforms are being introduced in both the organizati onal structure and the support systems necessary fo r the National Health Strategic Plan. Despite the pro gress, more support will be required from WHO; and we need the support of our South-East Asia Memb er countries, Portuguese-speaking countries and other regions. We need to increase information-shar ing to better our health system, especially relatin g to people's right to health care. We hope for donor s to maintain the commitments towards health- sector development so as to ensure continuity of ca re and services to our people. Therefore, I would like to urge all of us here today to put health fir st in our priorities and enhance WHO's role in lead ing the global health agenda, as we continue towards ou r vision for a healthy people in a healthy nation. Thank you very much.

An effective infant and young child feeding programme is in place, with full implementation of the WHO-recommended Integrated Ma nagement of Childhood Illness programme. Over the last five years, Tuvalu has reported a zer o maternal mortality rate, with all deliveries atte nded by a trained midwife in a health facility providing antenatal and postnatal services integrating famil y planning services, male involvement, counselling se rvices, management of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV referral systems. Tuvalu is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the Western Pacific Region, with high climate risk and increasing sea levels, rises in te mperature and limited adaptive capacity. Since 2007 , there have been increasing global and regional disc ussions on the likely impact that climate change and disasters will have on our tiny atolls in the s outh Pacific, including Tuvalu. If there is an incr ease A63/VR/5 page 133 in the frequency and intensity of disasters as a re sult of climate change, it is likely that our effor ts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 ma y never materialize. This combined interface has the potential to erase decades of developments achieved so far in Tuvalu. We are now two years past the mid-point to the 2015 deadline to reach th e Millennium Development Goals; this means less time remains to bridge existing gaps. Now therefore provides a good opportunity for Member States and development partners alike to take stock of pro gress achieved on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals as well as the effecti veness of support provided to countries to achieve the Goals. The volatility of food and fuel prices, the pressi ng issue of climate change and the looming global economic slowdown are exacerbating the press ures on Tuvalu to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and are threatenin g to reverse some of the gains that have been achieved. Clearly, there is an urgent need to scale up resources, programmes and interventions. In the absence of well-functioning health systems, powerfu l interventions and the money to purchase them will not be enough to reduce the gaps in health out comes. Further, a firm commitment is required from WHO, development partners and civil society to put countries on track to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals over the next six years. Allow me to congratulate WHO and in particular the International Health Regulations team for responding effectively to pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Tuv alu is now administering vaccines to protect its people from H1N1 and is already part of a regional movement to scale up disease surveillance systems with a focus on early detection and reporting in li ne with guidelines set forth by WHO. In closing, I would like to congratulate WHO for g ranting observer status to Taiwan, an impressive achievement by WHO to bring the world to gether in participation towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Tuvalu is looking for ward to other United Nations bodies including Taiwan in their systems. Mr Vice-President, thank y ou for giving me the opportunity, and thank you, delegates for listening.

Archbishop ZIMOWSKI (Holy See): Mr Vice-President, the recent report on monitoring the achievements of the health-related Millennium Development Goals (document A63/7) offer s us an appraisal of the successes and challenges. The Holy See delegation would like to j oin other delegations in acknowledging, among others, the growing success in reducing infant mort ality, malaria control, widening of access to antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV/A IDS, as well as treating and lowering the incidence rate of tuberculosis. There have been positive effo rts towards the achievement of some of the set goal s. It is true though, that the achievements vary from country to country and from Goal to Goal. On the other hand, my delegation cannot agree with program mes that promote abortion and contraceptives. We need to multiply initiatives that foster the ach ievement of personal maturity in sexuality and in t he mutual love and decision-making that characterize t he conjugal relationship in accordance with moral norms. The Holy See considers that abortion and con traceptive methods should not be promoted among targets for the new Millennium. Furthermore, there are continuing inequities betwe en health-care systems in high-income countries and those of low-income countries, and wo rse still, those in the so-called least developed countries. Moreover, even in the high-income countr ies themselves, there are wide gaps in access to health care. Closely related to these problems is t he lack of access among poor and marginalized people to medicines and other life-saving technolog ies because of lack of affordability or the poor health-care infrastructure in their home countries. Resources are badly needed by these poor countries to meet the funding shortfalls and strengthen their health systems. Pope Benedict XVI, in his recent Encyclical letter Caritas in veritate, makes a strong appeal for the \"Co-operation of the Human Family\". The Holy Fa ther stresses that the development of peoples depends, above all, on a recognition that the human race is a single family working together in true communion, not simply a group of subjects who happe n to live side by side. And in order to avoid paternalistic social assistance, which is demeaning to those in need, the solidarity of the rich natio ns to the poor countries has to be closely linked with th e principle of subsidiarity. Another complicating factor for access to health c are is the failure to find a balanced approach to intellectual property rights and the right to ma ke a just profit from investments in research and development for pharmaceuticals and diagnostics vis -\u00e0-vis the emergency situation posed to the global community by such pandemics as HIV/AIDS and by majo r diseases that affect populations in low- income countries. I wish here to reiterate the appe al made by the Servant of God, John Paul II, who in his address to the Conference on Economy and Health , promoted by the Pontifical Council for Health Care Workers, called upon pharmaceutical industries never to let financial gain prevail over the consideration of human values, but to be sensitive to the needs of those who do not enjoy social security, carrying out effective programmes to help the poorest and most marginalized. He said that we must work to reduce and, if possible, eliminate the differences between the various continents, urging the more advanced countries to make availabl e to the less developed their experience, technology and some of their economic wealth. Lastly, there are growing health concerns today re lated to climate change, and in the face of established evidence it would be irresponsible not to take the issue seriously. Thus Pope Benedict XVI , in his annual message for the World Day of Peace 20 10, called for urgent action to protect the environment, observing that climate change and envi ronmental degradation have a profound impact on the exercise of human rights, such as the right to life, food, health and development. Thank you, Mr Vice-President, and God bless you all. A63/VR/5 page 135 Professor Chih-liang YAUNG (Chinese Taipei): Mr Vice-President, health ministers, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, it is a privilege for me to address this plenary session in my capacity as Minister of Health of Chinese Taipei. Firstly, I would like to extend my congratu lations to the President, upon his election to the Presidency of this year's Health Assembly. I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to the Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, and her capable staff for arranging our participation in this Health Assembly for the second time in 39 years. Last year, Chinese Taipei's participation in the H ealth Assembly and incorporation into the International Health Regulations, (2005) framework enabled us to obtain guidance from WHO directly and to take more effective action in handling the p andemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza. Subsequently, we were able to produce our own vaccine and do our par t to prevent the spread of the pandemic. Your strong support for our meaningful participation wil l not go in vain. Moreover, when the earthquake hit Haiti in January this year, our rescue teams were a mong the first on the spot to assist with the relie f work. In the process, we worked closely with teams from Ecuador, El Salvador and the United States of America. We will further join hands with the glo bal community to assist Haiti in rebuilding its public health, medical care and disease prevention systems. These facts illustrate that our participat ion in WHO not only helps strengthen the global network for epidemic prevention, but also allows more countries to benefit from Taiwan's advanced medical capabilities. Over the past decade, the global financial crisis, epidemics, earthquakes, blizzards, droughts, floods, and other man-made and natural disasters th at have posed serious challenges to mankind. They have also impeded global efforts to realize the Mil lennium Development Goals 2015. As the deadline for achieving the Goals is drawing near, and consid ering that health is at the heart of the Goals, it is opportune for us to review where we stand today. To achieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals, WHO has devoted considerable res ources to a broad array of projects and has made substantive achievements. Chinese Taipei, like wise, has worked hard and made significant progress in such areas as the prevention of HIV/AID S and the eradication of malaria as well as other infectious diseases. In addition, we have built a c omprehensive medical care system and implemented well-designed public health plans related to women, children, and vaccination. Furthermore, we have established one of the most successful universal he alth insurance programmes in the world. Because of our endeavours, the health of the general public, p articularly women, children and senior citizens, ha s greatly improved. Chinese Taipei would like very mu ch to share these experiences with the rest of the world, and provide training and resources in a vari ety of fields to those countries in need. By workin g together with the international community, we can h elp achieve the health-related objectives set out i n the Millennium Development Goals. I would like to reiterate that diseases and disast ers know no boundaries. Severe acute respiratory syndrome and the H1N1 (2009) have made us all the m ore aware that only by joining forces can we minimize the impact of cross-border health crises. I therefore call for all countries to join together in support of WHO's policies. We need good use of this important health platform to promote better human security and reach the objectives set out in the Millennium Development Goals. Mr Vice-President and distinguished health ministe rs, the continuous participation of Chinese Taipei in WHO's work will not only benefit people i n Taiwan, but also help enhance the global system for disease prevention and strengthen the internati onal community's ability to respond to disasters. I cherish this opportunity to take part in deliberati ons on how to deal with public health challenges, a nd we very much hope to share our experiences, knowled ge and expertise. Last but not least, I wish the Sixty-third World Health Assembly great success. Th ank you very much. A63/VR/5 page 136 Mr SO Se Pyong (Democratic People's Republic of Kor ea): 1 Mr Vice-President, Madam Director-General, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I wou ld like, first of all, to extend warm congratulations to you, Mr Mondher Zenaidi, on your election as the President of the Sixty-third World Health Assembly. I believe that under your ab le leadership, this session will be a great success . It is of great significance in improving the healt h work and promoting the well-being of peoples in the Member States that the Sixty-third World Hea lth Assembly has taken up \"the Health-Related Millennium Development Goals\" as the theme of the g eneral discussions in the plenary meetings of the Health Assembly to undertake a review of progre ss and experiences thus far in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and consider wa ys forward to accelerate achievement of the agreed Goals. The delegation of the Democratic Peop le's Republic of Korea greatly appreciates the specific and practical steps and dedicated efforts that Dr Margaret Chan and WHO have made to achieve progress and success and mobilize resources for the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. Upholding the leadership of the Songun revolution of the great leader General Kim Jong II, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of K orea regards the improvement of the welfare of the people as its foremost principle and provides p olicy and legal guarantees for rendering equal and good-quality health-care services to all people, en suring that the State takes full responsibility for their health care. The Government has put forward as its major public health policy preventive health care, universal access to free health care, the household doctor system, training of health professionals according to the needs of the country, improvement of quality of health services and solid building of a self-sustaining pharmaceutical industry. It is st eadfastly maintaining the policy of giving utmost priority to the protection of life and the health o f the people in line with the nature of human-centr ed socialist medicine, and is making active efforts to open the gates to a powerful and prosperous countr y in 2012 and provide a healthier and better life to our people. Despite the serious difficulties caused by consecu tive natural disasters for several years and economic blockage by external forces, the Governmen t of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has given top priority to the protection and improv ement of health of mothers and children and made notable achievements in achieving the Millennium De velopment Goals by mobilizing all human and material resources in the country. These achievemen ts are most evident in the reduction of the infant mortality rate, the maternal mortality rate and in other health indicators. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has also established the telemedi cine system of linking a central hospital with the provincial hospitals to improve the quality of heal th care for the people with the support of WHO. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea still has man y challenges in the implementation of the health- related Millennium Development Goals by 2015. The h ealth system should be further strengthened, the quality of health services improved and infrast ructure reinforced. In April of this year, Dr Margaret Chan, Director- General of WHO, visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Dr Chan toured various health institutions and discussed the issues of further strengthening health services and implement ing the health-related Millennium Development Goals in the country, which marked another importan t occasion to further strengthen collaboration between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea a nd WHO. The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea takes this opportunity to express its sincere appreciation to the WHO Secretariat, th e Regional Office for South-East Asia, other international organizations and donors which have p rovided support to the country in its efforts to strengthen the capacity of infrastructure, and whic h provide medicines and other commodities and train health professionals, thus helping the countr y to implement the health-related Millennium Development Goals. Last but not least, I assure you, Mr Vice-Presiden t, that the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will actively cooperate with WHO and Member States to achieve the 1 The text that follows was submitted by the delegat ion of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for inclusion in the verbatim records in accordance with resolution WHA20.2.

Good after noon ladies and gentlemen, we shall now proceed with item 7, Awards. Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, we are assembled here today for the presentation of prizes awarded by the Sasakawa Memorial Health Foundation, the United Arab Emirates Health Foundation, and the Dr LEE Jong-woo k Memorial Fund. I have much pleasure in welcoming among us the distinguished winners of the se prestigious prizes. I am also very pleased to greet: representing the Sasakawa Memorial Health Foundation, Professor Kenzo Kiikuni, Chair of the Sasakawa Memo rial Health Foundation; representing the founder of the United Arab Emirates Health Foundati on, His Excellency, Obaid Salem Saeed Al Zaabi, Ambassador, Permanent Representative to t he United Nations Office and other specialized agencies at Geneva; and representing the Dr LEE Jon g-wook Memorial Prize for Public Health, Dr Han Kwang-su, President of the Korean Foundation for International Healthcare. Presentation of the Sasakawa Health Prize Remise du Prix Sasakawa pour la Sant\u00e9 Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, we shall start with the presentation of the Sasakawa Health Prize. I invite Professor Kenzo Kii kuni to address the Health Assembly on behalf of the Sasakawa Memorial Health Foundation. Professor Kenzo Kiikuni, you have the floor. A63/VR/7 page 141 Professor KIIKUNI (Sasakawa Memorial Health Foundat ion): Congratulations, Zhu he nin , Dr Du Xueping. Mr Yohei Sasakawa, the founder and WHO Goodwill Am bassador for Leprosy Elimination, wished to attend this important ceremony but he has to attend a National Day ceremony at Timor- Leste to enhance leprosy elimination, and asked me to address the Health Assembly on his behalf. The Sasakawa Health Prize was established 26 years ago to enhance the spirit of primary health care in an innovative way. As we all remember, in 1 978, 32 years ago, we unanimously agreed to pursue \"Health for All\", which will be our common o bjective for our global community, planet earth. And primary health care is the key element to achie ve our common goal. In the past, 45 individuals and institutions becam e distinguished winners of our award. One of the criteria of the award is not only innovative wo rk to enhance primary health care, but also the fut ure significance of their work looking forward. We ask each awardee how they propose to proceed with their work with our small prize money. We are grate ful for excellent selection of this year's award by the selection panel headed by our esteemed Presiden t of the Executive Board, Dr Zaramba. As we all know the People's Republic of China has a pioneering history of development of primary health care ideas. Dr Du is a graduate of N orman Bethune Medical University in northern China. Dr Bethune is the famous Canadian physician who followed Chairman Mao Tse-tung in the Great Leap forward and was one of the founders of m odern community health services in China. After graduation, Dr Du spent several years in Inner Mong olia before coming to Beijing's Capital University. China has made great economic progress in recent y ears and we are all envious of the great development. I sincerely hope that Dr Du's past ach ievement of training medical doctors in minority areas of central and western parts of China will le ad to a further development of community health services, and we do hope China will be a model of p rimary health care development, both in developed and developing countries. Thank you and a gain, congratulations! The PRESIDENT: It is with pleasure that I announce that the 2010 Sasakawa Health Prize has been awarded to Dr Du Xueping of China. Dr Du Xueping is Director o f the Yue Tan Community Health Service Center of FuXing Hospital, affiliated to the Capita l Medical University. She is being nominated by the Ministry of Health of China for contributing, since 1994, in a pioneering manner, to the development of general medicine in China, thus ensuring that it has become an important discipline in the Chinese health-care system. It is now my privilege to prese nt the Sasakawa Health Prize to Dr Du Xueping. Amid applause, the President handed the Sasakawa He alth Prize to Dr Du Xueping.

It is my pleasure to announce that t he 2010 Dr LEE Jong-wook Memorial Prize for Public Health has been awarded to Action for Aids, Singapore, represented by its President, Professor Roy Chan. Action for AIDS Singapore is a voluntary, community-based organization, formed in 1998, and registered as a charity since 1 994. I shall now invite Dr Han Kwang-su, President of the Korean Foundation for International Healthca re to address the Health Assembly on behalf of the Dr LEE Jong-wook Memorial Fund. Dr HAN Kwang-su (Korean Foundation for Internationa l Healthcare): Honourable Chair, Madam Director-General, honourab le delegates from the Member States, representatives of Action for AIDS Singapore, this year's award recipient, distinguished guests, ladie s and gentlemen. As President of the Korean Foundation for Internat ional Healthcare, I am honoured to stand before you today to pay tribute both to our late gr eat leader, Dr Lee Jong-wook, and to this year's recipient of the Dr LEE Jong-wook Memorial Prize fo r Public Health, Action for AIDS Singapore. Already, four years have passed since Dr Lee died. Despite the enduring sadness of Dr Lee's premature passing, we take optimistic pride in the fact that Dr Lee continues his noble work, even in death, through the Prize in his name. Moreover, we are confident that his ideals continue to be championed and realized by his dearest friend, coll eague and successor, Dr Margaret Chan, Madam Director-General, the tireless members of WHO, and all those who follow in his footsteps. This brings us to Action for AIDS Singapore, this year's Prize recipient. While Action for AIDS Singapore's work is ostensibly focused on Singapore at this time, we are confident that their achievements and ongoing efforts will set an exampl e - the standard - to be followed by others in the region, as well as the rest of the world. On behalf of the Korean Foundation for Internation al Healthcare and the Dr LEE Jong-wook Memorial Prize for Public Health, I ask you, the 19 3 Member States of WHO, to congratulate Action for AIDS Singapore and to follow their lead - not j ust with respect to HIV/AIDS but with all diseases A63/VR/7 page 148 and the marginalized people suffering from them, no t just for the sake of your nation and your people but for the sake of everyone in this world. Dr Lee Jong-wook would have accepted nothing less. Thank you. The PRESIDENT: Thank you. It is with great pleasure that I presen t the 2010 Dr LEE Jong-wook Memorial Prize for Public Health to Action for AIDS Singapore. Amid applause, the President handed the Dr LEE Jong -wook Memorial Prize for Public Health to Action for AIDS Singapore. Le Pr\u00e9sident remet le Prix Dr LEE Jong-wook pour la Sant\u00e9 publique \u00e0 Action for AIDS (Singapour). (Applaudissements) Professor Roy CHAN: Mr President, Madam Director-General, distinguishe d delegates, in 1986, a group of concerned individuals started a committee to address a new in fectious disease called AIDS. We felt that a community-based perspective to education, awareness , prevention and support was urgently needed to meet the challenges presented by AIDS in a traditio nal and conservative society. Action for AIDS was formed and registered in 1988. From the outset, because we were nongovernmental and privately and locally funded, o ur programme content, delivery and strategies were frank and largely free from censorship. In the area of awareness and education, we pushed the message of condom promotion and safer sex. This often attracted criticism from conservati ve groups and media. But we stuck to our mission and goals. Public education was communicated throug h mass media, as well as programmes through clubs, group meetings and street- and venue-based e vents. We enlisted the help of pop stars, artists a nd celebrities to promote safer sex. We utilized drama , pop concerts and music, organized walks, runs and marathon bicycle rides to create public awarene ss and to spread the message. Aware of our limited resources, we concentrated our efforts on those at highest risk and, in Singapore, these include men who have sex with men, street-based sex workers and clients of sex workers. We have also been targeting out-of-school youth and especially young men who have sex with men who are the most vulnerable. We raised funds to import and pay for expensive me dications - starting in 1990 with aerosolized pentamidine and influenza vaccination. When zidovudine (AZT) was introduced, our buyers' club hand-carried AZT from Australia. The b uyers' club has now grown to help poor patients obtain generic antiretroviral medications. We start ed a medication assistance fund to assist needy patients, including pregnant mothers, to access hig hly active antiretroviral therapy. We coordinate three peer support groups and have just opened a po sitive living centre. In order to promote HIV testing, we started the anonymous testing service i n 1991, which has provided over 100 000 tests to date. Three years ago, we started free and anonymou s venue-based testing in clubs and saunas for men who have sex with men, and are now planning for a m obile testing van service. We have fought HIV- related discrimination on many fronts, including bu rial rights and right of abode of HIV-infected foreign spouses of citizens. We have worked towards universal access to affordable antiretroviral therapy, increased access to education and preventi on, and have argued for the repeal of the law that criminalizes homosexual sex in Singapore. Over the last 22 years, we have enjoyed the suppor t and generosity of a very large number of individuals, businesses and organizations. We now a lso receive significant support and recognition from the Singapore government. None of our achievem ents would have been possible if not for the dedication and effort of volunteers, many of whom w ere and are HIV-positive. Our volunteer Governing Board has provided guidance and direction , and our tireless staff and volunteers have laboured to transform that into action. It is for a ll of them, and for the people of my country, that I proudly and at the same time very humbly receive th is award. On behalf of Action for AIDS Singapore, I would like to thank the Singapore Mini stry of Health for nominating us, the Awards A63/VR/7 page 149 Committee of the Dr LEE Jong-wook Memorial Prize fo r Public Health and the Korean Foundation for International Healthcare for this great honour. Thank you very much. The PRESIDENT: Thank you Professor Chan. This concludes our consi deration of item 7 of our agenda. I would now like to request that delegates remain seated fo r a few moments while the Director-General and I bid farewell to our guests. Thank you. 2. EXECUTIVE BOARD: ELECTION - \u00e9lection.

CLOSURE OF THE SESSION CL\u00d4TURE DE LA SESSION Le PR\u00c9SIDENT: Nous allons maintenant examiner le dernier point de notre ordre du jour : point 9, Cl\u00f4ture de l'Assembl\u00e9e de la Sant\u00e9. Je souhaiterais inviter le Dr Masato Mugitani, du Japon, Pr\u00e9sident de la Commission A, \u00e0 venir \u00e0 la tribune et \u00e0 s'adresser \u00e0 l'Assembl\u00e9e de la Sant\u00e9 pour faire la synth\u00e8se de s travaux de la Commission A. Docteur Mugitani, vous avez la parole. Dr MUGITANI (Japan) (Chairman of Committee A): Mr President, your excellencies, distinguished del egates, Dr Margaret Chan, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that I present to you this report of the work of Committee A duri ng this Sixty-third World Health Assembly. The work of Committee A concentrated on technical and health matters. The list of agenda items was extens ive and some of the discussions were vexatious, yet the Committee managed to proceed with 20 resolution s and we remained friends and colleagues because we shared a common unified ground and an un wavering commitment to the promotion and protection of public health. The following 19 resolutions on technical and heal th matters were adopted: Pandemic influenza preparedness: sharing of influenza viruses and acce ss to vaccines and other benefits; Health condition s in the occupied Palestinian territory, including ea st Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan; Advancing food safety initiatives; Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol; Marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages to children; Infan t and young child nutrition; Birth defects; WHO HIV/AIDS strategy for 2011-2015; Monitoring of the achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals; Viral hepatitis; WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel; Chagas disease: control and el imination; WHO's role and responsibilities in health research; Human organ and tissue transplanta tion; Accelerating progress towards achievement of Millennium Development Goal 4 to reduce child mo rtality: prevention and treatment of pneumonia; Improvement of health through safe and environmenta lly sound waste management; Improvement of health through sound management of obsolete pestici des and other obsolete chemicals; Strengthening the capacity of governments to constructively engag e the private sector in providing essential health- care services; and Establishment of a consultative expert working group on research and development: financing and coordination. A decision was also ado pted on Substandard/spurious/falsely- labelled/falsified/counterfeit medical products. Here are just some of the memorable highlights. Fi rst, a drafting group of Committee A worked for over 30 hours until 04:30 on Thursday morning t o obtain a consensus text of the resolution on international recruitment of health personnel. Sple ndid! A special thanks go to Dr Tangcharoensathien A63/VR/8 page 155 from Thailand for chairing this group. Secondly, th e delegates exhibited great restraint and disciplin e in coming together and finally adopting a resolutio n on alcohol. And thirdly, there were times when consensus seemed unobtainable, such as when we tack led the issues of substandard spurious, falsely- labelled, falsified counterfeit medical products. I t indeed felt like, as one delegate lamented, we we re waiting for Godot to provide us with an easy soluti on. My huge appreciation goes to Dr Ahmadi from Iran for stepping up to the plate and accepting the most difficult task of chairing the drafting group . The group showed flexibility and adopted a spirit o f compromise All the above, we did because we know that our Health Assembly resolutions will prov ide a robust and effective framework to tackle the myriad health issues that our populations face, and they are the ones that are directly affected by th e decisions made by this august Health Assembly. By the resolutions we have adopted, we are showing that our preparations matter, that we do care. It has been an honour and a privilege to serv e as Chairman of Committee A, both for myself and my country Japan. It was inspiring to observe how a ll of you made efforts to find common ground in such a constructive spirit of cooperation and solid arity so that we all can address the pressing publi c health needs of our constituencies. I would also li ke to acknowledge my fellow officers in Committee A for their most competent assistance, Vice-Chairme n, Mr Udo Scholten (Germany) and Dr David Chiriboga (Ecuador) and as Rapporteur Dr Praveen K. Mishra (Nepal); thank you dear colleagues. And of course all Committee A's work would not have been possible without the tremendous support and professional assistance we all received from th e secretariat of Committee A. I would like to thank Dr Monir Islam, Secretary, Committee A, and his tea m for ensuring that the work of the Committee could proceed smoothly and fruitfully. I thank you Mr President for your most competent a nd resourceful leadership, which was instrumental in achieving the objectives of this He alth Assembly. I would also like to thank the Vice- Presidents and the Rapporteurs for their superb sup port in making this Health Assembly as successful as it has been. And to you, Director-General, I wou ld like to extend my personal appreciation and utmost regard. Mr President, and all other offices and delegates, I wish you good health, peace and well-being in the interim time until we meet again next year here in smoke-free Geneva. Thank you. (Applause/Applaudissements) Le PR\u00c9SIDENT: A. J'invite \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent le Vice-Pr\u00e9sident de la Commiss ion B, le Dr George J. Komba Kono, du Sierra Leone, \u00e0 venir \u00e0 la tribune et \u00e0 faire la sy nth\u00e8se des travaux de la Commission B. Docteur Komba vous avez la parole. Leone) (Vice-Chairman of Comm ittee B): Mr President, distinguished delegates, Madam Direc tor-General, ladies and gentlemen, it is with pleasure that I present you this final report of th e work of Committee B during this year's Health Assembly on behalf of our Chairman, the distinguish ed Dr Wimal Jayantha, Deputy Director-General, Planning, in the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutriti on of Sri Lanka. Since most of the information on our work has been shared through the daily reports and the journal I am only going to present an overview. At the outset, we would like to compliment the work of the Programme, Budget and Administration Committ ee and to say that the work of the Committee has facilitated Committee B, which has benefited gr eatly from the reporting of the issues discussed during the Programme, Budget and Administration Com mittee. We concentrated our efforts on items pertaining to programme and budget matters, financi al matters, audit and oversight matters, staffing matters and management and legal matters. Our Committee worked effectively and completed the discussion of most of these agenda items in advance. We were able to accomplish the approval of eight resolutions and one decision. Having A63/VR/8 page 156 advanced well, we were able to deal with six additi onal items on technical and health matters transferred to us from Committee A, and we approved one additional resolution on the availability, safety and quality of blood products. This year the agenda item on the election of the D irector-General of WHO brought on a very long and arduous debate in which almost all the del egations became actively engaged. This is a testimony to the very high level of interest and at tachment that delegates feel for this Organization. It has been an honour and privilege for me to serv e as Vice-Chairman of Committee B. I would like to pay tribute to the leadership of our Chairm an, Dr Wimal Jayantha, and to all the delegations who participated very actively in all the discussio ns in a spirit of goodwill. I would like to thank m y colleagues, the other Vice-Chairman of Committee B, Dr Nasr El Sayed (Egypt) and the Rapporteur Dr Arne-Petter Sanne (Norway) for their good work t hroughout the deliberations of Committee B. I thank you, Mr President, for taking the work of thi s Health Assembly to a constructive and successful finish. Finally, on behalf of our Chairman and all the par ticipating delegations I would like to thank warmly the Director-General and all the members of the Secretariat who assisted and supported us in our work. We look forward to meeting again next yea r. In the meantime we take forward the recommendation of this Health Assembly to our count ries so that they can contribute to the improvement of the health and well-being of our peo ple. I thank you all. Actually, I would like to pay tribute to the members of Committee A for the compl ementarity that existed between us. Because of that complementarity we were able to do each other' s work when the going got tough on the other side. I thank you. (Applause/Applaudissements) Le PR\u00c9SIDENT: Je vous remercie le Pr\u00e9sident, Dr Jayanta du Sri Lanka, le Vice-Pr\u00e9sident, Dr Nasr El Sayed de l 'Egypte et vous avez dirig\u00e9 les travaux de la Commission l'Assembl\u00e9e souhaite l et exprimer ses remerciements pour le d\u00e9vouement dont il a lui \u00e9tait confi\u00e9e. The DIRECTOR-GENERAL: Mr President, honourable ministers, excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, you faced a challenging agenda, with a large number of items to discuss, including some surrounded by complex and potentially divisive issues. The Cha irmen and officers of the two Committees have been working extremely hard, and you have just hear d the outcome. I thank them for seeing us through an important, demanding and ultimately very difficu lt agenda. Hard work can bring a big payback, as long as it d oes not delay progress or disrupt the strong spirit of international cooperation for better heal th that has been growing in recent years. We have j ust seen two examples, shall I say, \"hot off the press\" , of this spirit of collaboration and consensus- building. Thank you for finding a way forward on th e issues of research and development financing, and substandard, spurious, falsely-labelled, falsif ied, counterfeit medical products. You reached agreement on some very important items that are a r eal gift to public health, everywhere. Thanks to some all-night efforts, we now have a Code of Pract ice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel. In addition, you have given public health a policy instrument and guidance for tackling one of the world's fastest-growing and most alarming healt h problems. This is the rise of chronic noncommunicable diseases, like cardiovascular disea se, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory A63/VR/8 page 157 disease. Many of these diseases develop slowly, but lifestyle changes that increase the risk are takin g place with stunning speed and sweep. We know that t he harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets are two of the four risk factors for these diseases. As several of you noted, the global strategy to re duce the harmful use of alcohol is a true breakthrough. This strategy gives you a large and f lexible menu of evidence-based policy options for addressing a problem that damages health in rich an d poor countries alike. The strategy sends a powerful message: countries are willing to work tog ether to take a tough stand against the harmful use of alcohol. Your resolution on the marketing of food and non-a lcoholic beverages to children responds to an astonishing statistic. This is a world in which some 43 million pre-school children are obese or overweight. Think of what this means in terms of li fe-long risks to their health. Think about the life - long demands for care at a time when most health sy stems are already overburdened, underfunded, and dangerously understaffed. I believe we all welc ome the news that the United Nations General Assembly will be addressing noncommunicable disease s in a high-level meeting in September of next year. Ladies and gentlemen, I have given you some person al impressions about a few items on your agenda. But this Health Assembly had a second dimen sion, expressed as your unwavering commitment to the health-related Millennium Develop ment Goals. I witnessed first hand your great desire to cooperate internationally, and with other sectors, in reaching these Goals. The spirit I personally witnessed was one of great optimism, sol idarity, and a can-do attitude. The technical briefings on the Millennium Development Goals have given the Secretariat some solid and inspiring guidance. I thank you for this guidance and want to assure you that we will be taking your arguments, views, experience, and enthusiasm forward at the Un ited Nations summit on the Millennium Development Goals later this year. I want to close by thanking the President and the Vice-Presidents for the guidance they have provided. I was particularly impressed by the effic ient manner in which, Mr President, you conducted the plenary sessions, and of course by the multilin gualism so well demonstrated by you, our able President. Thank you, and to all of you, honourable members and delegations; I thank you for all the support and your very active participation, and I w ish you a safe journey home. (Applause/Applaudissements) The PRESIDENT: Thank you, Dr Chan. (The speaker continued in Arabic.) de la Sant\u00e9. The session closed 21:30.
