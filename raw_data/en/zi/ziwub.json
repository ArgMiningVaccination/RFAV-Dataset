What evidence is available? General Self-assessment is the prime source of evidence, but the claim pack should be checked to see who has completed it. If the form has been filled in by the customer, due to the nature of their condition, it might not necessarily be an accurate or reliable des cription of their problems. If the claim pack has been completed on behalf of the customer, by someone who has a good understanding of his or her needs, then it could provide good evidence. The Departmental Decision Maker should bear in mind that the com pletion of the corroborative statement by a Health Care Professional (HCP) does not necessarily mean that they endorse what has been said in the claim pack. In all cases of severe illness it is highly probable that a consultant psychiatrist and/or physic ian will have been involved in the management and treatment of the individual. Indeed the absence of any documented history of a psychiatric or hospital medical consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis. Hospi tal factual reports should therefore be obtained if required. An HCP examination report may be helpful if t he person has physical problems Other sources of information include the following: Secondary Alcohol Team When the claimant is being supported by a Secondary Alcohol Team the care co -ordinator on that team will be the preferred source of further evidence. They have lead responsibility for the delivery of the care plan and so they can give details of the support that the claimant has been assessed a s needing. They will also know whether the claimant is being helped by an Assertive Outreach or Crisis Resolution team. NHS Care Programme Approach (CPA) care plan When the claimant is in contact with mental health services there will be a care plan under the NHS Care Programme Approach. The care plan will include information on health and social care as well as domestic support and is reviewed regularly. The claimant is given their own copy, which could be requested, as it will contain useful evidence of needs. Social Services care plan Social Services departments may be involved. A community care assessment by a social worker/care manager will be arranged and a care plan produced. The care plan will include details of the customer's day -to-day living and the support provided. A copy can be obtained from the customer. Social Worker Where a social worker has been appointed to support a claimant they will have information about the customer's ability to cope with everyday living. Subject to consent to approach them being given, the social worker will be able to provide some useful evidence about the customer's needs. Accommodation manager When the claimant is living in supported accommodation then the type and level of support prov ided could be helpful in determining their need for help. A phone call to the accommodation manager could provide useful evidence. Crisis Resolution Team The claimant may have been supported during a crisis by the Crisis Resolution Team. The teams are mai nly comprised of CPNs, who would make urgent visits, day or night to anyone who is thought to be in need of hospitalisation. The idea is to provide intensive treatment at home instead. The Crisis Resolution Team would be well placed to provide details of the customer's condition General practitioner factual report If there is no specialist health professional involvement or evidence cannot be obtained from them, then it may be necessary to request a factual report from the customer's own doctor. The GP ma y have only limited knowledge of customer's health problems, even when there is no one else involved. However, if the person has chronic physical or psychiatric complications, the GP may be well placed to provide a report regarding these. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility Needs General Information Many people misuse alcohol and experience only minor mental, physical or social disability. Alcohol dependence, in the absence of chronic complic ations should not be expected to give rise to significant ADL and mobility needs. Episodes of repeated drunkenness on their own cannot be prevented by reasonable supervision, although intermittent intervention by another person at specific times may reduc e the risk at those times. Withdrawal symptoms usually last for a few days and should not require long term help from another person. Self-neglect in people with alcohol dependency in the absence of chronic complications may require short -term attention from another person. However, such help should not be long term once drinking has stopped. During periods of rehabilitation the person may require support from others, but this should not amount to a need for attention or supervision The onset of chronic complications is likely to imply moderate or severe disability. The onset of serious, potentially life -threatening complications is likely to imply severe disability. The following tables present pen pictures of customers' likely mobility and ADL needs at varying levels of functional severity - mild, moderate and severe : Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Pen picture A person with a mild functional restriction drinks to excess and may suffer some of the milder consequences of al cohol toxicity. Many of these individuals do not contact a Health Care Professional or obtain treatment. If help is enlisted or treatment instituted, it is often in the form of \"brief interventions\" from the Primary Care Health Team. Effects Mild psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression Minor physical problems such as gastritis or gout Minor social difficulties including relationship, work related, or minor legal problems, such as convictions for drink drive offences. Mobility These pe ople would normally have no difficulty walking and would be able to find their way around outdoors. ADL People with a mild functional restriction would not normally have a level of functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day -to-day activities. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Pen picture A person with a moderate functional restriction is likely to have been drinking heavily for several years and have developed dependence or chronic complications such as peripheral neuropathy or epileptic fits. They are likely to be under the care of the Secondary Alcohol Team for ongoing treatment and are likely to have attempted detoxification. They are likely to experience gradual deterioration ov er several years with periods of remission and relapse in spite of treatment. Effects Effects may include: Symptoms of dependence Moderate psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression Moderate physical problems such as -: Peripheral neuropathy Cardiomyopathy Alcohol induced fits Blackouts - repeated Cirrhosis Mild Ascites Varices Pancreatitis Atrial fibrillation Alcohol amblyopia Alcohol related social difficulties including divorce, debt, unemployment, legal problems such as t heft and crimes of violence However, people with a moderate condition would not normally exhibit significant self -neglect Mobility Many of these people would normally have no difficulty walking outdoors, would be safely and independently mobile outdoors and be able to find their way around outdoors. However, some people's mobility outdoors could be restricted due to one or more of the complications described above. Refer to the relevant links on the 'How long will the needs last?' page. ADL Similarly, many people will not have any care requirements but again, some activities may be restricted or limited as a result of one or more of the complications described above. Refer to the relevant links on the 'How long will the needs last?'page. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Pen picture A person with a severe functional restriction will have been drinking heavily for several years and will have developed chronic, potentially life threatening complications such as cirrhosis, c ardiomyopathy and cognitive impairment. They are likely to be under the care of the Secondary Alcohol Team. They will almost inevitably continue to drink despite treatment and their alcohol related disability will deteriorate. The mortality rate for thi s group is high. 52% of people with cirrhosis die within 5 years if they continue to drink. Even if they stop, 33% die within 5 years. Effects Effects may include: Symptoms of dependence Serious physical and psychiatric conditions such as: Wernicke - Korsakoff Syndrome Cerebellar degeneration Advanced liver failure Hepatic encephalopathy Gross ascites Cardiomyopathy Cognitive impairment and dementia Pathological jealousy Self-neglect and homelessness Mobility Physical complications may make it difficult for the person to walk, but each case will have to be judged on individual merits. For example: Cardiomyopathy may cause severe breathlessness Cerebellar disease may cause gross ataxia [unsteadiness] Physical inertia and apathy may require someone to encourage the person with a severe alcohol related condition to get out and about. ADL The customer may need: encouragement to get out of bed in the morning encouragement to wash, dress and maintain hygiene assis tance in preparing meals encouragement to go out and engage in social activities help with domestic crises assistance with toileting assistance with taking medication and obtaining prescriptions help with attendance at doctors appointments, hospital appointments and day hospital Help with correspondence, financial matters and paying bills Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Alcohol dependence is often characterised by periods of remission a nd relapse. Where a person has received 2 or more courses of treatment or alcohol dependency has existed for more than 5 years there is unlikely to be any improvement. Where complications e.g. neurological, liver etc exist, there is unlikely to be any impr ovement. If evidence shows that the customer has an arrhythmia or cardiomyopathy as a result of Alcohol misuse, then also consult the Cardiac Arrhythmia or Cardiomyopathy guidance for additional infor mation. If evidence shows that the customer has Cirrhosis as a result of Alcohol misuse, then also consult the Cirrhosis guidance for additional information. If evidence shows that the customer has cognitive impairment as a re sult of Alcohol misuse, then also consult the Organic Brain disorders guidance for additional information. If evidence shows that the customer has Epilepsy as a result of Alcohol misuse, then also consult the Epilepsy guidance for additional information. If evidence shows that the customer has Pancreatitis as a result of Alcohol misuse, then also consult the Pancreatic disease guidance for additional information. If evidence shows that the customer has alcohol related amblyopia as a result of Alcohol misuse, then also consult the Vision guidance for additional information. Impairment Date of Onset Award Period Alcohol misuse Less than 5 years More than 5 years 2 year award Indefinite award Alcohol misuse - with complications -: Click on the above links for details of alcohol related complications including date of onset, award periods and disability codes . All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of sectio n Alcohol related disorders in people over 65 There is evidence that alcohol misuse in people over the age of 65 is increasing, especially in women. Although estimates vary, in one study, the prevalence of alcohol dependence in patients over the age of 60 admitted to hospital was 15 percent. For a variety of reasons, alcohol misuse may go unnoticed in this age group. Alcohol misuse may be suspected if, for example, there are unexplained falls and fractures, hypertension, confusional episodes, late onse t epilepsy, or failure to maintain previous standards of dress or behaviour. People over the age of 65 years have a lower tolerance to the effects of alcohol and this may result in the confusion associated with intoxication or withdrawal lasting longer th an in younger people. Alcohol misuse is associated with: Increased risk of stroke, subdural haematoma (blood clots in the brain) and infection. Memory loss. Hypertension. Peripheral neuropathy. Dementia. Depression, associated with a high risk of suicide. Symptoms of elation, leading to a diagnosis of mania. Hallucinations, leading to a diagnosis of psychosis. Withdrawal fits, leading to a diagnosis of epilepsy. Confusion, sometimes exacerbated by prescription of multiple medications. The signs an d symptoms necessary for a diagnosis of alcohol dependence are the same as for a younger age group, but they may present in unusual ways. For example, cognitive impairment may persist for up to a month following the acute withdrawal syndrome. Treatment i s similar to that for a younger age group, with some minor differences. For example, the death rate in untreated withdrawal syndrome is high at 10 to 15 percent, and must be considered a medical emergency.

Read more about award duration . Over 65s Adapting to a new amputation is more difficult over age 65...... Read more about effects in the over 65 age group Activities of Daily Living & mobility needs Upper Limb Amputations Levels vary from loss of the tip of a finger to the removal (or absence) of a whole limb or limbs, including the whole shoulder (forequarter amputation). Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) ADLs will depend very much on the remaining natural function of the limb and the type of prosthesis fitted. Loss of significant parts of both upper limbs is likely to be very disabling and to result in care needs. Care needs may also depend on the dominance of the affected limb. Loss involving the dominant limb (i.e. the right arm in a right -handed person) is likely to be more disabling than loss to the same extent of the other, non dominant limb. Loss of a thumb is more disabling than loss of a finger, because many day-to-day tasks depend on an adequate grasp between finger and thumb. Loss of a thumb or of a single finger is however unlikely to result in care needs u nless there are added complications such as arthritic changes involving the hands. In some cases the use of simple aids can help the person manipulate common household utensils. Care needs may be associated with fitting a prosthesis, and in the case of a functional prosthesis a period of training in its use is likely to be needed. Mobility Considerations Mobility will rarely be affected, but there may be balance problems, particularly if large parts of both upper limbs are absent. Lower Limb Amputations Levels can vary from the loss of the tip of a toe to amputation through the hip joint, or even including the removal of part of the pelvis (hemipelvectomy). Occasionally, complications may arise, such as swelling (oedema) of the stump, infection, friction which may lead to blisters and sore areas, or skin problems which rarely may be related to materials within the prosthesis. Bony spurs or re -growth of bone or neuromas (painful nerve swellings) may develop at the stump leading to a need for it to be refas hioned surgically. Following any of these complications and surgery, it may be necessary to leave the prosthetic limb off - continued use could lead to worsening of the condition. The prosthesis may need so be redesigned or adapted once healing has occurre d. It is normal for the person to feel that the lost limb is still there (phantom sensation) and occasionally this may be painful (phantom pain). Pain in the residual limb may arise as a result of painful swelling at the end of cut nerves (neuroma). In ad dition to problems with the residual limb there may be problems in other areas such as the back or the remaining limb. In particular, peripheral vascular disease severe enough to lead to amputation is likely to affect the remaining limb also. The onset of arthritis may be accelerated due to extra dependence on the remaining limb. Sometimes, long term (10 - 15 years after amputation) sequelae may arise due to twisting of the spine (scoliosis) causing chronic back pain, balance problems, chronic irritation o f the stump and the earlier onset of arthritis in the weight -bearing limb. Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) ADLs may be associated with help in fitting the prosthesis, care for the stump, and dealing with complications. Except in very young and very elder ly people, such needs are likely to be minimal. Usually, the higher the level of amputation, the greater the needs are. Until the person adapts to the prosthesis help may be needed to get in and out of bed, out of a bath and going upstairs and downstairs. The length of time over which help will be needed will vary from person to person with age and general health. Adaptation is more difficult in elderly people and they may also have the problem of arthritis in the other joints. If the person has had both l egs amputated, then their care needs may be greatly increased. Mobility Considerations Following the majority of amputations in otherwise fit persons, a prosthesis is fitted once the wound has healed, and the person is trained to walk, using aids such as a stick or walking frame as necessary. The functional level achieved will depend on a number of factors: the age, physical and mental fitness of the person; their motivation; the level of amputation and construction of the stump; and the availability of rehabilitation programmes. A young person, otherwise fit, will usually regain useful mobility following a period of rehabilitation of anything from one month to a year. Rehabilitation will be delayed by the presence of complications or obesity. Some people, particularly elderly persons and those with bilateral above knee (A/K) amputations, never learn to become independently mobile, and remain wheelchair users. The level of amputation will affect functional achievement. In cases of hemipelvectomy or amputat ion through the hip joint, although prostheses are satisfactory, they tend to be heavy. Walking is likely to be extremely fatiguing, and the quality of walking will be less than that of a person whose amputation is at a lower level. In above - knee amputat ions, provided the stump is of adequate length, it is possible in most cases to fit a prosthesis. A person with an amputation below knee (B/K) level can normally be fitted with a prosthesis. Amputation of the forefoot or toes may require no more than the f itting of special footwear. Balance problems may occur with amputation at any level, even the toes, especially the great toes. Such problems however are normally short term. Balance problems may be increased if the remaining limb is damaged or diseased. In cases of particular difficulty, advice from a Departmental Medical Services doctor may prove useful. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Needs will vary with many factors, including age, general health, reason for amputation, level of amputation and the presence of other disabilities. Following amputation, there is often a \"grief\" reaction to the loss of the limb and, if this is particularly severe in an individual, the rehabilitation process may be prolonged and counselling will be required. Amputation - lower limb/s Amputation - upper limb/s Amputation - upper & lower limb/s All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of dis abling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Over 65 New amputees Adapting to a new amputation is more difficult over age 65, this relates to the underlying in dication for amputation not just the age of the claimant. In this age group the indication is usually ischaemic or diabetic peripheral vascular disease. This group often have associated cardiovascular disease and physical deconditioning (loss of fitness). They often do not have the strength and flexibility to learn to walk on a prosthesis. This is because the work of walking with a prosthesis is much greater than walking normally; higher level amputations require more effort than lower level ones. For many, rehabilitation to walking with a prosthesis will not be possible and mobilising with a wheelchair will be the goal of rehabilitation. People who are otherwise fit and well can learn to walk after amputation over age 65 and the life span of an otherwise healthy amputee is normal. Existing amputees Although amputations from trauma and congenital limb deficiency are rare in the UK they give rise to a relatively large proportion of the amputee population because of their good prognosis. This group will have been mobilising with prostheses for many years. Arthritis, stump problems or the sheer effort of walking may limit their walking ability in later years despite a high level of adaptation, fitness and skill.

There would normally be no significant restriction of self -care activities or the ability to get around as a result of Anaemia and therefore further evidence would not usually be required in most cases. However, for Sickle Cell Anaemia, each case will need to be assessed on its merits. Further information may be nee ded from sources such as the General Practitioner , Hospital Consultant , Nurse Specialist or Health Care Professional examination report . Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Symptoms of anaemia in most individuals are mild, and do not result in any significant disability, with functional impairment being minimal in the majority of cases. Specifically, affected individuals would normally be able to carry out all activities of daily living, and there would normally be no significant restriction of self care activities. A minority of cases will have disability. Severe anaemia, particularly in the elderly, may result in symptoms of cardiac failure, when exertional breathlessness may be more severe, resulting in some impairment of various activities of daily living. Anaemia as a secondary complication of other disease processes, e.g., Rheumatoid Arthritis, will also not cause any significant impairment of function in the majority of people, and disability will be as a consequential effect of the primary condition. Each case will need to be assessed on its merits. Further information may be needed from sources such as the General Practitioner , Hospital Consultant , Nurse Specialist or Health Care Professional examination report . Anaemias of uncertain origin Anaemia, which is mild or moderate in degree, may develop secondary to various well recognised conditions, e.g. severe chronic infections, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic renal failure, liver cirrhosis, and malignant disease. The anaemia in these conditions does not usually cause any significant symptoms, and disability in these circumstances is as the result of the associated medical condition. How long will the needs last? In auto -immune haemolytic anaemia, the prognosis is more serious than in the hereditary form, death in haemolyt ic crisis being more frequent. The effect of blood transfusion, high dose steroids, and splenectomy are not as satisfactory as in the hereditary disease. Immunosuppressive therapy or thymectomy (removal of the thymus gland) may have to be considered with f ailure of first line therapy. Haemolytic anaemia occurs occasionally in association with a variety of other diseases such as chronic leukaemia, liver cirrhosis, malignant disease, syphilis and tuberculosis. Transfusion with incompatible blood will result i n destruction of the infused cells, and the production of an acute haemolytic anaemia, with resulting severe systemic reactions. Symptoms of anaemia in most individuals are mild with functional impairment being minimal in the majority of cases. Affected i ndividuals would normally be able to carry out all activities of daily living, and there would normally be no significant restriction of self -care activities. Anaemia as a secondary complication of other disease processes e.g. Rheumatoid Arthritis will als o not cause any significant impairment of function in the majority of people, and disability will be as a result of the primary condition. Severe anaemia may be more pronounced, resulting in some impairment of various activities of daily living. Note: Sickle cell anaemia is not covered by this guidance.

Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs The following tables presen t pen pictures of customers' likely mobility and ADL needs at varying levels of functional severity mild, moderate and severe : Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects Mild asthma is an intermittent condition, which causes breathlessness, leading to intermittent lack of exercise and activity tolerance. Though the person may be very breathless at times, the modern treatment available now would normally control symptoms. The attacks are likely to be short -lived and infr equent. Mobility Walking would normally be unlimited, i.e. well over 1 mile, except on the infrequent occasions when an exacerbation occurs, and this would only last for a few hours at the most controlled by inhalers. They may sometimes experience slight breathlessness on exertion, (i.e. when hurrying). ADL Daily life would normally be unaffected and the person could live independently and normally between attacks. Therefore, a person with mild functional restriction would normally be ab le to attend to all his/her own daily activities of self -care (bathing, dressing attending to his/her hygiene needs, and preparing a main meal for him/herself). Even when they have an attack they last for a short time, adequately controlled by inhalers. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects Moderate asthma is an intermittent condition, which causes breathlessness, leading to intermittent lack of exercise and activity tolerance. For some of the time, most days, people with moderate asthma would be wheezy and breathless, with symptoms being most noticeable at the beginning and end of the day. They would normally be intermittently wheezy at night. Mobility A person with moderate functional restriction would normal ly be able to walk well over half a mile (800 metres) on the flat, though they may become breathless on hills and stairs. However, they should manage this at a slower than usual pace. At this stage, the affected person would normally be likely to take a bronchodilator (such as \"ventolin\") before expected exercise. During an attack, walking distance could be severely affected but his would normally be for a minority of the time. ADL The degree of breathlessness would not be severe enough to affect the ability to bath, dress, and attend to hygiene needs and preparing and cooking a main meal. During exacerbations, this ability will be compromised, but only for a few days at the most. They would normally be well controlled with medication and the person wo uld normally be able to administer their own medication. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects Severe limitation of exercise, and activity tolerance. Acute exacerbations will occur on top of this. A person with severe asthma will normally be wheezy and breathless all the time. Mobility A person with severe functional restriction would not normally be able to walk 50 metres slowly, on the flat, without stopping for breath. They could not normally keep up with ano ther person of the same age and sex, while walking on level ground. ADL Any task, which requires physical activity, is likely to take longer due to severe breathlessness. Help may therefore, be required with bathing, dressing, getting round the house a nd going up and down the stairs, etc. They may not be able to prepare and cook a main meal, due to difficulty lifting a hot pan. They would not normally be able to manage one flight of stairs, without having to stop and have a rest. The affected person would normally be able to administer his/her own medication during an attack unaided. At night he/she would normally be able to use medication and call for attention if needed. Back to top of section How long will the nee ds last? In occupational asthma, early treatment, and removal of the person from the precipitating cause may effect a cure. Apart from that, asthma is a chronic but variable condition. Modern asthma treatment is capable of eliminating, or significantly re ducing asthma symptoms. The majority of attacks or flare - ups are short - lived and normally do respond to treatment. A minority of cases are \"brittle\" and treatment is less effective. Such cases should be discussed with the Departments Medical Services pro vider. Once treatment has been stabilised, the condition will normally remain static, and the care and mobility needs are not likely to change. Impairment Duration of assessment of severe asthma Award Period Asthma Assessed as severe for less than 5 years 3 year award Assessed as severe for more than 5 years Indefinite period All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Asthma in people over 65 It is estimated that around 6 -10% of older people have asthma, and it may genuinely present as a new illness, or the person may have had i t for many years. Because the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in the elderly can be more complicated than in those who are younger, asthma tends to be under - diagnosed and under -treated and indeed may present late, with worse asthma symptoms, as older pe ople may not perceive the feeling of breathlessness so well, and may just believe breathlessness is a normal consequence of ageing. The elderly asthmatic is more likely to have worse symptoms, more likely to be hospitalised, and more likely to die, becaus e of late presentation, diagnosis, and treatment, and potential interactions of asthma medications with other drugs. The presentation may not be typical [e.g. of breathlessness at night (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea) rather than wheeze], and though the elderly asthmatic is less likely to have associated allergies and eczema, he/ she is likely to have co -existing conditions, including cardiac conditions, which can confuse the picture. The very medications, which are normally used to treat asthma can have serious side effects which can worsen the elderly asthmatic's general condition and quality of life. They are more likely to suffer from a racing heart, tremor and even angina from beta agonists (such as Salbutamol). Theophylline takes a long time to clear from the blood. Because the elderly asthmatic is likely to be taking other medications for other conditions, there is more likelihood of drug interactions, and treatment goals may have to be modified, because of this, as well as the person's general condition, and older people are more likely to be taking beta blockers or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory medication, which can make asthma worse. Adverse side effects can occur when elderly people are put on steroids, as they may become confused or even psychotic, and further osteoporosis may occur in already weak bones. Older people are more likely to have problems with using metered - dose inhalers, if they have physical impairments [e.g. stroke, arthritis, visual impairments, tremor, or problem s with co -ordination]; or mental impairment [such as cognitive impairment]. In these cases, a device to aid metered - dose delivery, a spacer device, or breath -actuated device may be needed.

It may be d ifficult to obtain recent medical evidence for adults with autistic spectrum disorder, when they have limited contact with their general practitioners or hospital services , since their general health is sa tisfactory. However for older teenagers and young adults some reports and previous assessments, including those made by educational psychologists , may be available in their medical records or from the school or college they a re attending -: Special Education Needs (SEN) Note: These reports should be accompanied by medical evidence wherever possible. They may also have been assessed by speech and language therapists, occupational therapists , social workers and other health care professionals who provide services for people with learning disabilities living in the community. Copies of reports may be obtained from community teams, social services or local authorities. This applies to those living at home and in residential accommodation. Customers or their carers may also have copies of these assessments or care plans. Adults with Autistic Spectrum Disorder who have associated mental health disorders may have been referred to community mental health teams and psychiatric clinics, from which reports can be re quested. An assessment by a Health Care Professional is appropriate when disabilities are stable and long standing, and when other sources of evidence are not available, or give insufficient detail to ascertain the overall level of functional impairment. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Autistic spectrum disorder and normal or above average intelligence Some people with high functioning autism will have ADL and mobility needs. Others will have lower levels of need and are likely to be able to deal with self care and bodily functions, and to be able to prepare a simple meal. Some will live independently; some will need a more structured environment within a family, or with support from carer s. A structured routine organized by another person may be important in enabling them to maintain personal hygiene and proper nutrition. Assistance with communication may be needed in some situations. For example some people would be unable to cope with a domestic emergency, or major change of routine. In such situations they might need help in communicating with strangers or outside organizations. Autistic spectrum disorder with mild to moderate learning disability Within this grouping there will be a wid e spectrum of disabling effects that may require help from others. Some will live in supported accommodation and some will live at home, usually with carers. They are likely to need help or encouragement to wash, dress, prepare food etc. They may need to be advised to wear clothes appropriate to the season and to eat a varied and nutritious diet. It may be necessary to discourage aimless and repetitive behaviours and to encourage participation in appropriate activities. Some may be vulnerable to financial a nd sexual exploitation. Medication may need to be given and supervised. They often need help to communicate with others e.g. unfamiliar people, to avoid social isolation and to deal with correspondence and financial matters. Some may need to be watched ove r to prevent damage to surroundings or maintain a safe environment, and to discourage challenging behaviour. The care provided allows them to live within a structured environment and routine, whereby they are able to maximise their abilities to carry out t asks of daily living. They are often likely to need guidance in both familiar and unfamiliar places, even if they are able to manage short trips on known routes e.g. to a local shop. Some may be vulnerable to exploitation or exhibit disturbed or anti soci al behaviour when out. Communication with strangers may pose great difficulty, and they would be unable to ask for help or directions, or to respond to directions in a meaningful fashion. Some individuals may have difficulty communicating with others when out of doors. They may show unusual or unacceptable behaviour such as shouting, for example, if routine journeys are disrupted or altered. Autistic spectrum disorder with severe learning disability Many adults with this degree of impairment will live in supported or residential accommodation with a high degree of help and support from care workers. Some will live at home with family. They will need help with most aspects of personal care to maintain nutrition and prevent self neglect. Attention will be re quired to discourage repetitive or aimless behaviours, and to encourage participation in appropriate activities. They may need watching over to prevent potentially dangerous behaviours or activities such as running off, or to deal with disruptive or challe nging behaviour. Associated problems like epilepsy or other physical disabilities will increase the requirement for help and supervision including the administration of medication. The ability to walk is likely to be unimpeded in the absence of neuromuscu lar problems affecting the lower limbs. But they will be unable to find their way out of doors without help from some one else. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Although adolescents with these conditions progre ss in their education and are able to acquire a variety of daily living skills as they mature, it is unlikely that there will be much substantial change in their abilities in adulthood. Adults with moderate/severe autism are unlikely to be able to live ind ependently or be employed. Those with high functioning autism, including Asperger syndrome, may acquire jobs, but their condition impedes their ability to secure or retain employment without support. Jobs secured may be of a lower level than their educatio nal ability, and people may be unable to remain in a job for prolonged periods of time. Learning disability runs a life long course with little change. Once care and mobility needs have been established they are unlikely to improve and a life award should be considered. However, intellectual or physical deterioration can occur in later life and may result in increasing care and mobility needs. Impairment Award Period Asperger's syndrome Indefinite award Autism Indefinite award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstanc es of the individual claimant.

However, if further details are needed, the Specialist Nurse [CPN] , Consu ltant or General Practitioner is an appropriate source of information. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs General Information When evaluating claims of anxiety and fear the Departmental Decision Maker needs to decide i n the first instance whether the customer is describing normal sensations or emotions occurring in everyday situations. If the symptoms appear to be part of an anxiety disorder or other mental health disorder, the Departmental Decision Maker will have to decide from the evidence whether the symptoms are of sufficient severity and pervasive nature that the resultant functional impairment would give rise for a need for help with care, getting around or supervision. People who have a genuine severe anxiety r elated condition would have consistent disability when considering their activities of daily living. For example a person who is unable to go to the doctors surgery would also be expected to be unable to attend leisure activities. The following tables pr esent pen pictures of customers' likely mobility and care needs at varying levels of functional severity - mild, moderate and severe : Back to top of section Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects The following would normally be characteristic of a person with mild functional restriction. They may include mild or intermittent symptoms of anxiety, (perhaps precipitated by a life event), worry, mild irritability, mild sleep disturbance and ti redness or mild physical symptoms such as sweating and a dry mouth. Mobility A person should not have difficulty safely finding their way around unfamiliar places outdoors although those especially with agoraphobia may feel reassured if accompanied. However, should the companion not be present, the affected person is unlikely to be unable to find their way around outdoors. ADL People with mild functional restriction would not normally have any significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. Attention to bodily functions is unlikely to be affected by social phobia. Although very distressing at the time for the person involved, panic disorder is unlikely to put the pe rson or others at risk of danger. Episodes are short lived, and even if frequent during the day are unlikely to prevent the person attending to their own personal care. The disabling effects of simple phobias are restricted to situations in which the per son comes into contact with the object causing acute anxiety, or manoeuvres, which the person undertakes to avoid the stimulus. Simple phobias do not give rise to a need for help with personal care of for supervision out of doors in unfamiliar places. There is no need for supervision in social situations, since there is no risk of danger to the individual. The person would be able to find their way around in unfamiliar places without help, since there is no confusion, impairment of judgement or difficulty in thinking. People with agoraphobia are unlikely to have any need for help with personal care. Although people may suffer anxiety symptoms while out, those with less severe symptoms are able to go out and carry out normal tasks like shopping. They hav e no need for supervision since they are not confused, their memory is normal and concentration is usually normal and unimpaired. Also their ability to communicate with others is not impaired. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects The following would normally be characteristic of a person with a moderate functional restriction. They may include more severe and chronic symptoms or frequent episodes of severe anxiety. Worry and apprehension, which are difficult to c ontrol. Irritability and poor concentration. More severe physical symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, trembling, hyperventilation [over breathing] and more severe sleep disturbance. Mobility A person should not have difficulty safely finding their w ay around unfamiliar places outdoors although those especially with agoraphobia may feel reassured if accompanied. Should the companion not be present, the affected person is unlikely to be unable to find their way around outdoors. However, a person with a moderate or severe functional restriction due to Depressive Illness together with associated Agoraphobia may have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and may require support. ADL People with moderate functional restriction would not normally have any significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. Attention to bodily functions is unlikely to be affected by social phobia. People with a moderate functional restriction would not normally exhibit significant self -neglect. Although very distressing at the time for the person involved, panic disorder is unlikely to put the person or others at risk of danger. Episodes are short lived, and even if frequent during the day are unlikely to prevent the person attending to their own personal care. The disabling effects of simple phobias are restricted to situations in which the person comes into contact with the object causing acute anxiety, or manoeuvres, which the person undertakes to avoid the stimulus. Simple phobias do not give rise to a need for help with personal care of for supervision out of doors in unfamiliar places. There is no need for supervision in social situations, since there is no risk of danger to the in dividual. The person would be able to find their way around in unfamiliar places without help, since there is no confusion, impairment of judgement or difficulty in thinking. People with agoraphobia are unlikely to have any need for help with personal ca re. Although people may suffer anxiety symptoms while out, those with less severe symptoms are able to go out and carry out normal tasks like shopping. They have no need for supervision since they are not confused, their memory is normal and concentratio n is usually normal and unimpaired. Also their ability to communicate with others is not impaired. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects The following would normally be characteristic of a person with a severe functional restriction. They may include very severe and chronic symptoms or frequent episodes of severe anxiety, worry and apprehension that are difficult to control or irritability and poor concentration. More severe physical symptoms such as palpitation s, dizziness, trembling, hyperventilation [over breathing]. More severe sleep disturbance, perhaps de -personalisation and de-realisation. They may be extremely limited in their social function and are likely to avoid almost all contact and never leave thei r homes. They may be unable to attend social events and leisure activities. Mobility The person may have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and may require guidance as would a person with a moderate or severe functional restriction due to Depressive illness together with associated Agoraphobia or severe Anxiety. For people with agoraphobia alone, a minority of people have severe disease. Some never leave the house at all, even with a companion, or only go out very occasionally to specia l events or appointments with an escort. It may be difficult for such people to receive an assessment of their condition and appropriate treatment, unless the mental health team can provide these in the first instance in the person's home. ADL People with a severe functional restriction would not normally have such significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities e.g. washing, dressing and maintaining acceptable standards of h ygiene and nutrition. People with a severe functional restriction would not normally exhibit significant self -neglect. Nor is it likely that the condition would put the person or others at risk of danger. Back to top of sec tion How long will the needs last? For first episodes of an Anxiety Disorder, the prognosis is uncertain for the first 6 to 12 months and it would be reasonable to award for a limited period whilst awaiting the outcome of response to treatment. Similarly , for infrequent repeated episodes it would be reasonable to award for a limited period initially whilst awaiting the outcome of response to treatment. Generalised Anxiety Disorder - How long will the needs last? For first episodes of an Anxiety Disorder, the prognosis is uncertain for the first 6 to 12 months and it would be reasonable to award for a limited period whilst awaiting the outcome of response to treatment. Similarly, for infrequent repeated episodes it would be reasonable to award for a limit ed period initially whilst awaiting the outcome of response to treatment. Generalised Anxiety Disorder is a chronic condition. Spontaneous remission is rare and exacerbations are common.

Exposure treatment can achieve long -term cure in about half of patients with specific phobias. Complex phobias In complex phobias e.g. a social phobia, the condition is life -long and unremitting if untreated, and there is a substantial rate of relapse even after prolonged treatment.

Untreated, agoraphobia typically runs a chronic course. Treatment seems to be most effective if instituted early in the development of the disorder, when the person is encouraged to return to the situation, which provokes the symptoms. Although people may continue to experience some mild anxiety, they are able to function normally again with treatment e.g. go shopping alone. Relapse is common but people should be offered further treatment if this occurs. People however with established symptoms lasting over one year have a poorer prognosis. These who have the co ndition over 5 years are likely to have life long problems, even with prolonged treatment. 20% of patients with agoraphobia eventually achieve spontaneous remission. 90% of patients with agoraphobia will experience significant improvement with treatment.

Back to top of section Anxiety disorders in people over 65 Isolated anxiety disorders, including agoraphobia are unusual in people over 65. When they occur, they are usually associate d with a depressive illness. Agoraphobia may, however, sometimes occur following an acute physical illness, despite a good recovery from the underlying physical condition. Treatment is similar to that for a younger age group, with some minor differences. For example, as many people with anxiety states have a co - existing depressive illness, the use of sedative antidepressants may be useful.

Mechanical Back Pain Mechanical Back Pain is also called by a number of other medical terms. These are -: Non-specific back pain Osteoarthritis of spine (without pathological/neurological changes) Simple backache Lumbago Spondylosis (without spondylitis (without pathological/neur ological changes) Spasm of back Back pain Degenerative back problem or disease Chronic back pain Muscular back pain Most people (60 -80% of the world's population) will experience back pain at some point in their lifetime. 85 -90% of all episodes of back pain are non - specific or mechanical in nature. Mechanical means that the source of the pain may be in the spinal joints, vertebrae or soft tissues. However, in the vast majority of cases of mechanical back pain it is not possible to identify a pathologically definable problem. That is, no structural abnormality of the back can be found on examination or x -ray to account for the symptoms. Multiple studies have shown that spinal abnormalities are as common in symptom free individuals as they are in those who have back pain. These incidental findings may include: Non-specific degenerative changes Bulging inter -vertebral discs Desiccated discs Soft tissue and/or bony abnormalities Specialised investigations such as Computerised Tomography (CT) an d Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans have also failed to identify a cause for MBP. Many alarming abnormalities in the lumbar spine and associated structures have been discovered in symptom free people with normal back function on MRI/CT imaging. Mecha nical back pain is therefore best described as non -specific. Once an individual has experienced their first episode of mechanical back pain, although the episode itself is usually self -limiting and resolves quickly, there is an increased risk of further b ack pain episodes. Risk factors for recurrent back pain include: Smoking Previous pain syndromes (e.g. Fibromyalgia) Poor socio -economic status Psychological distress at presentation Dissatisfaction with employment Heavy manual work Back to top of section What evidence is available? Mechanical Back Pain The claimant and/or carer are unlikely to be able to provide the information required to clearly distinguish between Mechanical Back Pain and Specific Back Pain and to accurately assess resulting mobility and care needs diagnostic details should be obtained from the General Practitioner or Consultant. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility considerations - Mechanical back pain Mechanical Back Pain Category Description Disabling Effects During an acute bout of mechanical back pain, sudden onset of pain may render an individual temporarily immobile on each occasion. These episodes of severe pain and restriction are likely to be infrequent and of short duration and are unlikely to last longer than 1 -2 days. Pain usually quickly subsides to a much lower level and usually completely resolves, the majority being completely symptom free in 1 -2 weeks. Only 5% of the total will still ex perience discomfort at 12 weeks but will normally have minimal functional limitations. Individuals with chronic low back pain may experience some difficulty in bending the lower back. The affected individual should be encouraged to maintain a positive ment al attitude and return promptly to employment and normal activities/lifestyle. This is important in maintaining independence and reducing unnecessary reliance on others. Similarly, as mechanical back pain does not lead to neurological or other problems in the lower limbs, mobility should not be restricted. MBP is, however a common cause of Fibromyalgia. Mobility Walking would not normally be adversely affected. The person would normally be able to walk normal distances with no significant impairment of gait or speed. No guidance or supervision needs are anticipated. ADL The person would normally be able to carry out self-care tasks without help. Specifically they would normally be able to sit, rise, bend down using the hips and knees and g et in and out of bed in the usual fashion. They would normally be able to prepare a main meal for themselves. People with this condition would not normally suffer from falls and supervision and watching over would not be required. Note: In a small propor tion of cases MBP can cause disability. The main distinguishing feature in such cases is a marked and ongoing problem with pain. This has 2 main aspects: Difficulty in coping with pain. Problems with pain management. A multidisciplinary team approach in the management of such cases is essential, together with early intervention. Evidence that the individual is having significant difficulties in coping with pain and that referral to a Pain Management Clinic is necessary supports the claimed limitations of lifestyle due to MBP. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Mechanical Back Pain The prognosis for complete recovery in mechanical back pain is excellent. By the end of 6 weeks, 90% of both new and recurrent episodes of mechanical back pain are symptom free, with the majority of these resolving fully in 1 -2 weeks. A further 5% recover within 12 weeks. The remaining 5% develop persistent pain leading to chronic low back pain. The development of chronic low back pain however does not equate with disability. As a general rule, individuals with chronic (longstanding and persistent) back pain have minimal care needs or mobility restrictions. In a small percentage of cases, psychological and psychosocial factors lead to the development of a disabled lifestyle. Most people with a herniated cervical disc (about 80 -90%) improve significantly with conservative treatment. Only about 10% require surgical treatment, and most people make a full recovery and return to wor k within a month or two. A small minority of those receiving surgery do go on to have chronic symptoms such as persistent pain and upper extremity weakness and numbness. MBP is most unlikely to cause any significant long -term care or mobility needs. Peop le with this type of back problem almost always learn methods and strategies in order to adapt and overcome their difficulties (e.g. rising from bed, stooping, dressing and preparing a main meal). They will actively refuse help, which is known to worsen th eir pain (e.g. being pulled up from sitting or from lying in bed, or being turned over in bed). It should only be rarely that the Departmental Decision Maker considers that entitlement due to Mechanical Back Pain is appropriate. It is strongly suggeste d that each case is discussed with Medical Services to confirm entitlement and to decide upon the duration of award. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling eff ects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Back pain in people over 65 The prevalence of back pain declines slightly after th e age of 65. It is commoner in women. Severity, chronicity and disability may worsen with age although the results of studies are inconsistent. Although the majority have non -specific back pain, most of which is due to degenerative disease, the incidence of specific back pain rises in comparison to younger people. Treatment of non -specific back pain. Treatment of non -specific back pain is similar to that in younger people with some minor exceptions.

Further details should be obtained from the Consultant, Physiotherapist , Occupational Therapist or General Practitioner . Activities of Daily Living and Mobility considerations - Specific back pai n Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of restriction would normally have some pain and discomfort in the lower back and possibly in the buttocks and thighs as well. They may experience discomfort from tightening of the neck or back muscles. Their discomfort is likely to be more noticeable on physical activity, but these periods of increased discomfort are likely to be infrequent and of short duration. Mobility People with such a restri ction would normally be able to walk several hundred metres at a normal or near normal speed. They would be unlikely to suffer from falls. If an acute flare up occurs, mobility may be more severely affected but this would be for the minority of the time. There would be no need for guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL People with this level of functional restriction would normally be able to safely manage all aspects of their personal care. More difficulty with personal care tasks may arise if flare-ups occur, but this will be for the minority of the time. Specifically there would normally be no significant difficulty in getting out of a normal height chair, getting in and out of bed and the bath, rising from the toilet and coping with personal hygiene or climbing stairs safely. There would normally be no significant difficulty in dressing, using appropriate aids where necessary, or with feeding, washing, shaving and aspects of main meal preparations such as lifting pans and peeling vegetables. S ome difficulty may be experienced in bending. However, If good hip and knee movements are present, bending can be achieved even with minimal back movements by bending at the hips and knees. People with such a condition would not normally suffer from falls and there would be no requirement for supervision and watching over. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction are likely to experience pain and discomfort in their neck or lower back for most of the time. The pain may radiate into one buttock predominantly and travel down that leg below the knee into the foot and toes. The leg pain is often accompanied by numbness and tingling on the affected side in the specific region supp lied by the nerve root. They may also experience discomfort from tightening of the back muscles. In the case of cervical prolapse (herniation), pain may radiate from the neck to the arm, and is often associated with numbness and tingling. Mobility People with such a restriction will be able to walk at least a few hundred metres at a normal or near normal speed. They should be able to walk with a mild limp, and they would be unlikely to suffer from falls. There would be no need for guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL People with this level of functional restriction could have difficulty coping with some activities of daily life in particular dressing their lower garments e.g. trousers and socks due to bending difficulties but technical aids are available to overcome this if present. They would normally be able to carry out other personal care tasks such as rising from a normal height chair, getting into and out of bed and the bath and climbing stairs. However, despite the presence of pain or discomfort, f unctional limitations in performing these activities are likely to be minimal in the majority of cases. If the upper limbs are affected, aspects of main meal preparation such as lifting pans and peeling vegetables would normally be possible, albeit with so me discomfort. Simple aids such as a light saucepan are helpful to overcome any difficulties. There is likely to be some restriction of spinal movements, e.g. limitation of forward flexion and extension of the back, and reduced sideways (lateral) flexion o n one side. However, If good hip and knee movements are present, bending can be achieved even with minimal back movements by bending at the hips and knees. People with such a condition would not normally suffer from falls and there would be no requirement for supervision and watching over. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction are likely to experience constant severe pain in their lower back for most of the time. The pain is likely to radiate into one buttock predominantly and travel down that leg below the knee into the foot and toes. The leg pain is often more severe than that experienced in the back, and is usually accompanied by numbness and tingling on the affecte d side in the specific region supplied by the nerve root. Tightening of the back muscles may add to the overall level of pain. Sleep may be disturbed by pain in some people. Moderate to strong analgesia may not be fully effective in relieving symptoms. Flexion of the spine is likely to be significantly restricted. Marked weakness of the thigh muscles may be present and there may be associated muscle wasting. Foot drop may be present. In cervical involvement, constant severe upper limb pain, weakness and abnormal sensation are present. Mobility Walking would normally be restricted in terms of distance (this may be in the range of 40 to 100 metres) and speed due to severe pain in the lower back and leg. They would normally have an abnormal gait, walking wi th a limp. There may be an increased risk of falls due to leg weakness, loss of sensation and foot drop although walking aids may help with mobility. There may be a need for guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL People with this level of functional restriction would normally have difficulty coping with many activities of daily life. They may have considerable difficulties getting out of bed and out of the bath. They are likely to have difficulties with dressing, particularly with their lower garment s e.g. trousers, socks due to bending difficulties. There may be considerable difficulty with other personal care tasks, such as rising from a normal height chair, climbing stairs and aspects of main meal preparations such as lifting pans, and bending to a traditional oven to insert and remove items. Due to leg weakness on one side, loss of sensation and possible foot drop, a risk of falls may be present. There may be a requirement for supervision and watching over if falls occur even with the use of walkin g aids. If affected on both arms there may be marked problems with dressing, preparing a main meal and toileting. If however only one side is involved, only bimanual tasks are affected. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Specific Back Pain Prognosis and duration of disabling effects will vary according to the condition. The outlook for the majority of individuals with specific back pain is good with fifty percent (50%) of cases recovering fully wi thin six weeks. The remainder will develop longer lasting back pain, and may also have leg pain and/or other symptoms on one side. These symptoms may become longstanding and persistent (chronic), but this does not equate with disability. Many individual s with a prolapsed disc, even when nerve root entrapment is present, will normally have mild disability.

Back to top of section Back pain in people over 65 The prevalence of back pain declines slightly after the age of 65. It is commoner in women. Severity, chronicity and disability may worsen with age although the results of studies are inconsistent. Although the majority have non -specific back pain, most of which is due to degenerative disease, the incidence of specific back pain rises in comparison to younger people. Degenerative disease of the spine With advancing age, these changes are universal. However, even though the majority of the population have X ray evidence of degenerative disease of the spine by age 65, there is poor correlation with symptoms. Spondyloli sthesis is the forward movement of one vertebral body over the vertebral body beneath it. In older people the most common cause is degenerative change in the spine. It is usually an incidental X ray finding and does not usually cause a clinical problem. Symptoms, if present are usually non -specific and nerve root entrapment is uncommon. Occasionally it can cause narrowing of the spinal canal resulting in spinal stenosis. Degenerative disease of the spine predisposes to spinal stenosis and prolapsed inter -vertebral disc (see relevant sections). Metabolic bone disease Osteoporosis is the metabolic bone disease of greatest clinical and economic significance in the elderly (see relevant section). Paget's disease (osteitis deformans) occurs in 3 percent of el derly people. It is caused by increased bone turnover. The resulting bone is larger than normal but is mechanically weak. It is usually asymptomatic. The most commonly affected bones are the skull, pelvis, femur and tibia and the lumbar spine. Any sympt oms that occur depend upon the bones affected. Symptoms arise from: Deformities and fractures in the weakened bone. Nerve compression by the expanding bone (for example the auditory nerve, resulting in deafness). Cardiac failure due to an increased blood supply to the affected bone. Back pain due to Paget's disease may be treated with analgaesics, but may warrant treatment with specific medication such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates (for example, etidronate). Ankylosing Spondylitis In the elderly, adva nced spinal disease may result in fused or \"bamboo\" spine, spinal fracture, or spondylodiscitis, all of which result in significant reduction of spinal mobility. Treatment includes physiotherapy, exercise, education and non -steroidal anti-inflammatory med ication (NSAIDs) as this reduces discomfort and the risk of permanent deformity. Neoplasm (Tumour/cancer) The incidence of back pain caused by neoplasm increases with age. In one study, 7 percent of people with back pain over the age of 50 were found to h ave a neoplastic cause, either primary or secondary, compared with no cases of neoplasm in people under the age of 50. Infection Although uncommon, these are more common as a cause of back pain in the elderly. People with infections of the spine are usual ly generally unwell. Treatment is usually with the relevant antibacterial agent, usually antibiotics. Back to top of section Cauda Equina syndrome This rare condition is a severe neurological disorder that normally results from a prolapsed disc. It can lead to incontinence and even paraplegia, and is often a medical emergency. The cauda equina is Latin for \"horse's tail\" and describes the bundle of nerve roots at the end of the spinal cord. The spinal cord ends at the upper region of the lumbar spine and becomes a bundle of individual nerve roots like a horse's tail, which continue along the spinal canal. The cauda equina is the continuation of these nerve roots in the lumbar region. Cauda equina syndrome most commonly results from a central disc prolapse in the lumbar region. It is accompanied by a range of symptoms, the most important features are: rapidly worsening neurological signs and symptoms in a person with a known lumbar disc prolapse. bilateral leg pain (sciatica) and neurological signs (muscle weakness and sensory loss). saddle (or caudal) anaesthesia [unable to feel anything in the body area that would normally sit on a saddle]. urinary or bowel incontinence. Prompt surgical treatment is indic ated for cauda equina syndrome, ideally within 48 hours of the onset of the syndrome. Delay may result in permanent neurological damage with functional limitations. If left untreated, cauda equina syndrome can result in paraplegia. Back to top of section Spinal Stenosis This is a condition where there is narrowing of the spinal canal. This may be caused by recurrent disc prolapse and subsequent loss of disc height, or by arthritis of spinal (facet) joints where bony outgr owths (osteophytes) impinge on the spinal canal. Due to spinal canal narrowing, nerve root pain and paraesthesia (sensory impairment with numbness and tingling) occur. These symptoms usually commence in later life, usually after 50 years of age, and are c haracterised by back and leg pain brought on by physical activity, and relieved slowly by rest. Bending forwards also relieves symptoms, as this activity opens the spinal canal. Individuals with spinal stenosis commonly report that their symptoms are eas ed by walking uphill, or on climbing stairs, or by leaning on a supermarket trolley, as these activities involve bending the spine. Disabling Effects As a general rule, many individuals with spinal stenosis will have symptoms that develop slowly over time; minimal or mild care and mobility needs would normally be present. Such individuals would normally be self - caring. Mobility would not normally be significantly restricted in the majority of cases. A minority of cases develop rapidly worsening symptom s and functional limitations, with severe restriction of walking tolerance. Treatment Most individuals with spinal stenosis, where the person's symptoms are mild or of short duration will be offered non -operative therapy. This consists of a combination of short periods of bed rest, controlled physical activity, physiotherapy, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, pain relief medication and epidural injections. Not all of these may be required in every case. A minority of individuals will have severe incap acitating nerve root pain in one or both legs and severe back pain on activity (known as spinal claudication, 'neurogenic intermittent claudication' or 'psuedoclaudication'). These symptoms are often accompanied by absent reflexes, muscle weakness and loss of sensation in the legs. Such cases are referred for consideration of surgery, when a laminectomy is the treatment of choice. This spinal operation is often successful in fully resolving the person's symptoms. Click on link below to return to: - Pain Management Clinic Back to top of section Tumours (Cancer) and Specific Back Pain Tumours affecting bone can be either Primary, arising from the bone itself, or secondary satell ite deposits called Metastases arising from a distant non-bony tumour. The following tumours commonly metastasise to bone: - bronchus thyroid breast kidney prostate malignant melanoma multiple myeloma Primary bone tumours are far less common than metastases, and present with local pain and swelling. Treatment will depend upon the type of tumour, but usually involves surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The majority of spinal pain arising from tumours is due to metastases. These satellite deposits invade the bone (and other tissues) and alter the function of that tissue or put pressure on surrounding tissues and structures. This may result in a variety of symptoms. Back pain from metastases can result from the cancer growing insid e non -expandable bone, or from pressure on nerves and/or other surrounding structures. Metastatic bone disease typically presents with bony pain, pathological fractures or spinal cord compression syndrome. Most tumours weaken bone by producing substances, which encourage bone re -sorption. The weakened bone is thus more likely to fracture than normal bone, (a pathological fracture), and due to the presence of the cancer is less likely to heal. Disabling effects Spinal cord compression syndrome occurs when t he tumour compresses the spinal cord or the nerve roots in the spinal canal. This causes pain and loss of function of the nerves (neurological deficit). Such a person may develop severe mobility restrictions and may have difficulty getting into and out of bed and the bath, rising from a chair, dressing and undressing, preparing a main meal and attending to toilet needs. Under these circumstances there may be care needs both day and night. The longer a person has a neurological deficit, the less likely norm al nerve function will return. Urgent surgical decompression of the spinal canal may be indicated, along with other treatments to inhibit the cancer, and control pain. If performed promptly, this may restore much functional ability and decrease care and m obility needs. Management of metastatic bone disease The most effective way to treat metastases is with anti -tumour therapy, e.g. radio or chemotherapy. Where this is ineffective, efforts should be concentrated on the following: Control of pain: Pain re lief medication. Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). Nerve blocks. Treatment of local lesions: Surgical fixation of fractures, if possible. Spinal cord decompression. Drugs to inhibit bone re -sorption: A cure may not normally be possible with advanced metastatic bone disease, and the above measures may be palliative in their intent (i.e. designed to relieve symptoms rather than cure the disease). Palliative therapy can often improve quality and length of life, but with this level of disease a claim under the Special Rules would not be unreasonable. Back to top of section Pain Management Clinic Not to be confused with Pain Clinics, which are usually run by anaesthetists and aim to treat the pain. Pain Management Clinics are run by a professional multidisciplinary team, usually consisting of a psychologist, physiotherapist, nurse and doctor. Pain management programmes are offered to people who have chronic pain of at least 6 months duration and whe re all other appropriate treatments have been undertaken. Referral from a GP or local hospital is required, and an initial assessment is carried out by the clinic to confirm suitability for the programme before a place will be offered. The programme lasts between 8 -10 weeks and consists of small groups who meet weekly for a half - day session. Usually this is conducted on a non - residential basis, but in severe cases a residential option may be offered. A variety of methods are employed by the multidisciplinary team. The basis of the programme is aimed at introducing coping strategies, which help individuals manage their pain and improve their quality of life. This will include psychological, physical and practical techniques, known as Cogn itive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).

The claimant may be supported by the Care Programme Approach (CPA) and hold written information outlining the level of external support required, which is a useful first source of further medical evidence. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects Symptoms of anxiety and panic arising from the disorder would be unlikely to be prominent or cause any functional limitation. Limb function would be normal. Mobility People with mild functional restriction would, for example normally have no difficulty finding their way around outdoors, because they do not usually experience any confusion, inattention, memory loss, or impaired judgement. ADL People with mild functional restriction would normally be able to care for themselves by maintaining personal hygiene, preparing meals etc. They would have little or no functional limitations on a day -to-day basis and their mood would be normal and they would be alert and orientated with no evidenc e of confusion, memory loss, poor concentration, disordered thinking, or impaired judgement. They would not require supervision or watching over to prevent abnormal behaviour. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with moderate functional restriction who manifest hypomanic symptoms may become overactive, agitated, inattentive, noisy, have bizarre ideas, delusions and disordered thinking such that they are unable to initiate and complete the usual tasks of dai ly living. Sleep patterns may be disrupted with unacceptable or antisocial behaviour occurring at night. Aggressive, hostile and violent behaviour may develop. Insight into their medical condition may be limited and the need for treatment denied. Self - neglect, social isolation, and social withdrawal may occur in moderate bipolar disorder when depressive symptoms are predominant Confusion, incoherent speech, decreased memory, and impaired judgement may be present. Symptoms of anxiety and panic disorder may also occur as part of the illness. Limb function would be normal. Mobility People with moderate functional restriction would display inattention, confusion, poor concentration, incoherent speech, memory loss, impaired judgement and anxiety and panic diso rder, which would indicate that they may need guidance or supervision outdoors. Bizarre and anti-social behaviour may be a problem out of doors. ADL People with moderate functional restriction, if in the hypomanic phase, would need to be encouraged to get up at an appropriate time, wear suitable clothes, maintain personal hygiene, prepare and eat regular meals, go to bed and remain there at night. If depressed they would need encouragement to initiate and complete tasks of daily living e.g . they may need to be told and encouraged to get up, wash, dress, and prepare meals in order to maintain a reasonable standard of hygiene and nutrition. They might have to have support mechanisms in place to maintain a stable routine for the person to prevent relapse and exacerbations of symptoms or need to be reminded and encouraged to attend a day centre, hospital or psychiatric clinic appointments or attend for regular blood tests if taking lithium. If depressed they may need to be encouraged to particip ate in social and leisure activities to reduce social withdrawal and isolation or need help with communication, correspondence, and financial matters including prevention of reckless spending. Someone to supervise their medication and some supervision indoors due to inattention, decreased concentration, confusion, incoherent speech, memory loss, impaired judgement and bizarre/anti social behaviour. They may need protection from financial or sexual exploitation. Severe Functional Restriction Category Descr iption Disabling Effects People with severe functional restriction who manifest severe symptoms of mania may become very overactive, very agitated, inattentive, noisy, have bizarre ideas, delusions, hallucinations and highly disordered thinking. Sleep patterns may be disrupted and unacceptable or antisocial behaviour occurs throughout the night as well as by day. They may fail to eat or drink at all and can potentially collapse with exhaustion. Aggressive, hostile and violent behaviour may develo p. Insight into their medical condition may be limited and the need for treatment denied. Self - neglect, social isolation, and social withdrawal may occur in moderate bipolar disorder when depressive symptoms are predominant. Confusion, incoherent speech, decreased memory, and impaired judgement may be present. Symptoms of anxiety and panic disorder may also occur as part of the illness. Limb function would be normal. Mobility People with severe functional restriction would display inattention, confusion, incoherent speech, memory loss and impaired judgement, which is likely to indicate that they would need guidance or supervision outdoors. They may exhibit anti - social, bizarre or occasionally hostile or aggressive behaviour, which is also likely to requir e guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL People with severe functional restriction, if in the manic phase would need to be encouraged to get up at an appropriate time, wear suitable clothes, maintain personal hygiene, prepare and eat regular meals, go to bed and remain there at night. If depressed encouragement would be needed to initiate and complete tasks of daily living e.g. they may need to be told and encouraged to get up, wash, dress, and prepare meals in order to maintain a reasonable standard of hy giene and nutrition. Regular contact to prevent self - neglect and a decline into apathetic behaviour. If not encouraged, the person may lie in bed all day and do nothing, or engage in aimless, repetitive activities. They would need to be reminded and enco uraged to attend a day centre, hospital or psychiatric clinic appointments and to attend for regular blood tests if taking lithium. If depressed, encouragement to participate in social and leisure activities to reduce social withdrawal and isolation would be required and help with communication, correspondence, and financial matters including prevention of reckless spending. To have support mechanisms in place to maintain a stable routine for the person to prevent relapse and exacerbations of both manic and depressive symptoms. Supervision from a carer to reduce risk of self - harm. Encouragement to eat or drink. Supervised medication including attendance for medication by injection in some cases. Supervision to deal with the consequences of bizarre, antisoc ial, hostile and aggressive behaviours. They may need protection from financial or sexual exploitation. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Although recovery from an individual episode of mania or depression ca n be expected, the long -term prognosis for people with bipolar disorders is poorer than might be anticipated. Long - term studies (25 years) show that on average a person with bipolar disorder will have ten further episodes of mood disturbance. The time in terval between episodes tends to shorten with increasing numbers of episodes and increasing age. Although treatment of an individual episode of mania or depression symptoms may be relatively effective, people continue to have disabling symptoms affecting d aily life, social interaction and ability to work. For a person who is making a reasonable recovery from a single episode of hypomania or severe depression it may be appropriate to make a limited award. Those people who relapse infrequently, perhaps every 3 to 5 years, and in whom the evidence shows that the mental state is normal between relapses might also be eligible for a limited award. People who have a history of recurrent episodes, and in whom symptoms of abnormal mood exist most of the time, despi te treatment with appropriate medication, should be considered for an indefinite award. The following features are likely to indicate long - term disability -: Recurrent episodes of mania and depression. Decreasing interval between episodes of relapse. History of multiple hospital admissions. History of admission under the Mental Health Act. In sheltered or supervised accommodation. Long - term prescription of mood stabilising drugs such as lithium. Treated with ECT. Rapid cycling disorder. Impairment Date of Onset, frequency of relapses & mental state between relapses Award Period Bipolar disorder Less than 5 years or More than 5 years and one relapse in a 3 year period or 5 year award More than 5 years and mental state normal between relapses. More than 5 years and more than one relapse in a 3 year period or More than 5 years and mental state not normal between relapses. Indefinite award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the i ndividual claimant. Back to top of section Bipolar disorders in people over 65 The incidence of bipolar disorder in people over 65 is similar to that in younger people. It accounts for between 5 and 10 percent of affective illness in old age. The symptoms are similar to those found a younger age group, but in older people it is more likely that a depressive episode will occur immediately after a manic episode. Treatment is similar to that for a younger age group, with some min or differences. For example, because older people are more sensitive to medication, lithium blood levels should be monitored with particular care and the level should be kept at the lower end of the therapeutic range.

There are three different categories used in care and mobility guidance for bladder cancer and are: Superficial bladder cancer Invasive bladder cancer Advanced or metastatic bladder cancer Superficial There are usually no care or mobility needs associated with superficial bladder cancer or its treatment. Invasive Care The symptoms of this condition are not disabling and the aim of treatment of this conditi on is to return a person to full health. If someone is receiving treatment it is unlikely that there will be enduring care needs once recovery from surgery or radiotherapy treatment is complete. If any award is made to cover disabling effects during the tr eatment period it should be of limited duration. The exception to this is Where other disabilities mean that a person cannot manage their own continence or urostomy without help in which case a life award should be made to reflect that urinary diversion is permanent, an example of this would be severe rheumatoid hands affecting manual dexterity or mobility problems. Where enduring but rare side effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment occur. If cancer has returned after treatment for invasive b ladder cancer - follow Advanced or Metastatic bladder cancer guidance below. Mobility There are usually no enduring mobility problems associated with this condition. Advanced or Metastatic Care They may experience any of the common disabling effects of me tastatic cancer such as those caused by brain, liver and bone metastases. For those who have developed metastatic disease after cystectomy they may have difficulty managing their urostomy through fatigue, particular problems for them may be dealing with la rger heavier night bags used to collect urine and dealing with laundry associated with leaks. A further problem may be the added burden of extra tubes and equipment associated with nephrostomy tubes (this is a catheter inserted through the back - into the kidney when the urine outflow from the kidney is blocked) - a kidney which is blocked like this may be very painful. This is in addition to the general effects of metastatic disease. Mobility A particular problem for people with bladder cancer may be lymph oedema of the lower limbs which has a profound effect on the ability to walk. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Superficial This is the commonest type of bladder cancer and has the best long term outcome. About 75% of people diagnosed have this sort of bladder cancer. Invasive It is recommended that if treatment is not being given for any reason and if needs are identified an indefinite award is made. If treatment is being given, any award made should be limited to the length of treatment and a reasonable period of recovery. In the typical case a return to health is expected once recovery from treatment has taken place. Advanced or Metastatic Average survival with supportive treatment only i s 2-4 months. With maximal treatment including cisplatin based chemotherapy this can be extended to 12 -14 months with 20% of people treated like this living for 3 years or more. No long term improvement in condition is expected, this is a terminal illnes s.

Hospital Factual Report In cases of acute and chronic disorders, a Consultant Urologist would normally have been involved in the diagnosis, management and treatment of the individual. In th e case of stones, the admission may have been urgent and there should be relevant hospital records available. The absence of any documented history of a specialist consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if required. General Practitioner Factual report Conditions such as acute infections would usually be treated by the GP. Also, the General Practitioner would normally have made t he initial referral of the claimant to the Consultant (if a referral has been made) and would normally be aware of the results of tests, treatment and current medication. Therefore a GPFR is often most useful in these cases.

Complex claims may also be referred to Medical Se rvices for discussion. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Most congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract are diagnosed at birth and they are all correctable either by treatment or b y surgery. For example, reflux is treated in children by long - term antibiotics. They may also grow out of it or the ureters are re -implanted by operative procedure. Many conditions are treatable or surgically correctable where relevant. If a person is mentally competent, and has normal use of his/ her limbs, urinary incontinence, and other conditions such as stricture can be managed by self - catheterisation, intermittent catheterisation, indwelling catheter with a bag (via the urethra or suprapubic) and / or the use of incontinence pads. The only situations in which care / mobility needs may be appropriate are - : Functional incontinence caused by a severe mental health condition such as dementia or severe psychosis. Advanced cancer of the prostate or bl adder, for example. Click on the links for details of Bladder cancer guidance and Prostate cancer guidance. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Many of the urological problems that present are treatable or corrected by surgery. For instance, infection such as pyelonephritis and bladder, urethral or prostate infection are treatable by antibiotics. Conditions such as stones in the ureter or bladder, for instance, will be treated by the stone passing naturally or being removed surgically. Conditions such as stricture of the urethra, hydronephrosis/hydroureter and benign prostatic hypertrophy can be treated surgically. In the case of malignancy, this may or may not be curable. Click here for Bladder cancer guidance and Prostate cancer guidance. A person with incontinence, as long as they are mentally competent, can normally manag e it independently. However, if they have other conditions limiting mobility or manual dexterity for example, they may not be able to cope independently. In summary, there are very few situations where there are disabling effects arising from urological conditions, two exceptions being incurable malignancy and functional incontinence (where the background factor is a severe mental health condition). Note: The 'qualifying period' and 'prospective test' would not normally be satisfied with urological diso rders, as treatment and recovery would normally be complete before the end of this period.

What evidence is available? Anyone with haemophilia, clotting factor deficiency or von Willebrand's disease, however mild, will have access to a Comprehensive Haemophilia Care Centre. People with moderate and severe haemophilia are likely to use the centre along with anyone with mild haemophilia and haemophilia related joint problems. Often the centre will be used for all health needs not only those related to haemophilia. This is because haemophilia complicates any type of medical treatment - e.g. dentistr y. A range of professionals will be involved with care and these include the treating haematologist , the specialist nurse , specialist physiotherapist and social worker . The consultant or specialist nurse at the centre will be a good source of information on severity of haemophilia and clotting replacement therapy required. The specialist physiotherapist will be the best source of information on mobility and joint problems. Anyone with such problems is likely to have had a joint scoring assessment. Joint score information for the lower limbs may be enough to confirm reduced mobility. If difficulties with care related to upper limb j oint damage are claimed, further medical evidence in the form of a factual report in addition to joint scores is recommended. If neurological problems are claimed, either of these sources will be able to provide evidence of disabling effects. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Mild Functional Restriction Moderate Functional Restriction Severe Functional Restriction Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Likely treatment Clotting factor replacement is only required after significant injury or trauma. It is not required frequently enough to require home supplie s and self treatment. Mobility Mobility will depend on whether there is joint damage to the lower limbs. The probability of this will depend on the customer's age. A small proportion of people with mild haemophilia born before 1970 have significant joint damage from untreated bleeds that occurred before clotting factor treatment was available. Joint damage is not likely to be widespread and in this group joint replacement, particularly knee replacement can improve mobility. This is becaus e in many cases most of the other joints are healthy, having not been affected by bleeding episodes. ADL Personal care may be difficult if the elbow or shoulder is significantly affected and range of movement in both these joints is poor. This is rare and is only likely in adults born before 1970. In these cases, help may be required with personal hygiene, dressing, meal preparation and administration of treatment. Supervision by others does not prevent bleeds or prevent adults with normal cognitive function from sustaining injuries. Adults are able to recognise the onset of bleeding and seek help or self -treat. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Likely treatment Likely to self administer clotting factors on an as required basis. Mobility Mobility will depend on whether there is joint damage to the lower limbs. The probability of this will depend on their age. People born before 1970 will have significant joint damage from untreated bleeds that occurred before clotting factor treatment was available. People born from 1970 onwards may have some joint damage depending on their frequency of their bleeding and the number of significant bleeds into joints they have had over the years. If mobility is restrict ed, this will be because of pain related to arthritis in the hips, knees and ankles. Joint replacement of individual joints will relieve pain from arthritis and prevent further bleeding into that joint but will not improve range of movement or mobility. Th is is because other joints are affected. If a 'fixed flexion' deformity of the knee or hip is present then mobility is especially likely to be reduced, a flexion deformity effectively shortens the affected leg and affects gait. In someone with multiple dam aged joints, this places further strain on other joints and increases the risk of bleeding when walking. People with moderate haemophilia born more recently are likely to have very little joint damage. This is because clotting factor treatment can be admi nistered at the onset of bleeding at home before a significant amount of blood has collected in the joint. ADL Personal care may be difficult if the elbow or shoulder is significantly affected and range of movement in both these joints is poor. This is much less common than mobility problems due to lower limb involvement. It is particularly likely in adults born before 1970. Supervision by others does not prevent bleeds or prevent adults with normal cognitive function from sustaining injuries. Adults ar e able to recognise the onset of bleeding and seek help or self -treat. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Likely treatment Likely to be on self administered prophylactic (preventative) clotting factor treatment at home. This involves several injections a week as described under treatment. The majority of adults are able to administer this themselves. Bleeding episodes are recognised early and extra clotting factors administered as described so preventing further joint damage f orm uncontrolled bleeding. Mobility Mobility will depend on whether there is joint damage to the lower limbs. The probability of this will depend on their age. People born before 1970 are likely to have significant joint damage from untreated bleeds that occurred before clotting factor treatment was available. People born from 1990s onwards may have no or minimal joint damage as large bleeds into joints have been effectively prevented by prophylactic treatment. People born after 1986 may also have receive d prophylactic (preventative) treatment and be mobile. The majority will have some joint damage. Mobility is likely to be restricted because of pain on walking related to arthritis in the hips, knees and ankles. Joint replacement of individual joints will relieve pain from arthritis and prevent further bleeding into that joint but will not improve mobility or range of movement. This is because other joints are affected and they will still be painful on walking e.g. ankle pain becomes more noticeable after k nee replacement. If flexion deformity of the knee or hip is present than mobility is especially likely to be reduced, a flexion deformity effectively shortens the affected leg and affects gait. In someone with multiple damaged joints this places further strain on other joints and increases the risk of bleeding when walking. People born before 1980 are likely to have multiple affected joints and mobility problems. ADL Personal care may be difficult if the elbow or shoulder is significantly affected and range of movement in both these joints is poor. This is much less common than mobility problems due to lower limb involvement. It is particularly likely in adults born before 1970. In these cases help may be required with personal hygiene, dre ssing, meal preparation and administration of treatment. Supervision by others does not prevent bleeds or prevent adults with normal cognitive function from sustaining injuries. Adults are able to recognise the onset of bleeding and seek help or self -treat. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Impairment Haemophilia A Haemophilia B (Christmas disease) Von Willebrand's disease Clotting disorder - Other / type not known Haemophilia People born before 1970 are likely to have disabling problems related to joint damage and multiple joints are likely to be affected. People born before 1991 may have contracted one of the blood borne diseases associated with clotting factor replacement. Younger people may have no or minimal joint damage because they have received prophylactic (preventative) clotting factor treatment from a young age thereby reducing bleeds and long -term damage. Prophylactic therapy was not used throughout the UK until the mid to late 1990s. Anyone born before then may have disabling problems related to joint damage. People with haemophilia born since then are unlikely to have significant joint damage unless they have an inhibitor. Mild Functional restriction Care and mobi lity needs related to neurological damage are indefinite and so indefinite awards are recommended. As joint damage is less widespread in this group, joint replacement can significantly improve mobility. Awards should be reviewed after hip or knee replace ment surgery. Joint replacement in the upper limbs will not significantly improve function and awards made related to upper limb arthritis and deformity should be indefinite. Moderate Functional restriction Care and mobility needs related to neurological a nd joint damage are indefinite and so indefinite awards are recommended. Severe Functional restriction Care and mobility needs related to neurological and joint damage are indefinite and so indefinite awards are recommended. Von Willebrand's disease The m ajority of people will have mild disease. In some cases, drug treatment to reduce bleeding will be necessary. No care or mobility needs are anticipated in this group. In more severe cases, where treatment with clotting factors is required to control eithe r spontaneous bleeding or bleeding after trauma or surgery, there may be joint damage or neurological damage as in haemophilia. Assessment of care and mobility needs in these cases should be carried out as for haemophilia. Supervision by others does not p revent bleeds or prevent adults with normal cognitive function from sustaining injuries. Adults are able to recognise the onset of bleeding and seek help or self -treat. Where needs arise because of neurological impairment or joint damage related to episodes of bleeding follow the guidance for haemophilia. Care needs are likely to be indefinite for neurological and multiple joint damage. Development of Inhibitors Indefinite awards are recommended whether treatment for inhibitor is effective or not. T his is because damage caused by uncontrolled bleeding is a permanent effect even though the cause of it (inhibitor) may have been effectively treated. Care and mobility needs related to neurological damage are indefinite and joint replacement does not impr ove mobility or range of movement. Other clotting factor deficiencies These are rare conditions and the effects will be variable. When assessing mobility, evidence of neurological impairment and joint damage related to bleeding should be assessed as for ha emophilia. Indefinite awards are recommended. Female haemophilia carriers No care or mobility needs are anticipated. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Over 65 People born before the 1970s are likely to have had many bleeding episodes prior to the introduction of clotting factors treatment. They are likely to have significant and widespread joint damage related to previous bleeding episodes even if bleeding is well controlled now. Mobility is likely to be significantly reduced and they may be unable to walk at all due to flexion deformities of the lower limb joints. They may require help with personal care and administration of treatment due the effects of severe arthritis on the joints of the upper limb. They may have neurological problems related to past episodes of bleedi ng or a blood borne virus related to clotting factor treatment in 1970's and 1980's.

Hospice Hospice Speciali sts -: Palliative Care Physician Macmillan Nurse Clinical Nurse Specialist Social worker Physiotherapist Occupational Therapist Counsellor Back to top of section Activities of Daily living and Mobility needs The design of stomas has improved dramatically in recent years, as have the appliances to go with them. Problems of smell and leak are much less common. It would be extremely unusual for a stoma to be fashioned if the patient couldn't physically take care of i t themselves. If needs are claimed in relation to stoma care because of other disabilities supporting medical evidence of disability should be obtained. Typically people with bowel cancer are able to attend to their care needs and have no difficulty getti ng around. However problems with care and mobility are likely to arise when someone -: Has metastasis or recurrent disease Already has or develops other disabilities which compound the effects of bowel cancer or its treatment Help with personal care for the purposes of DLA is typically not required during or after potentially curative treatment of colorectal cancer. Help with personal care will be required in the first few days after surgery. If a stoma is fashioned as part of the surgery help may be req uired for some weeks until the person gets used to managing it for them selves. A stoma care nurse will normally provide specialist support at home (visits and phone calls) for the first few weeks and be available in future should problems develop. Care wi ll not be required for the majority of the time during chemotherapy although during treatment weeks another person will probably need to help out with cooking, shopping and other tasks because of treatment side effects. The exception to this may be peopl e having very intensive treatment for rectal cancer. It can be appreciated that people having preoperative radiotherapy to the pelvis for up to 6 weeks followed by major surgery and possibly a 6 -9 month course of chemotherapy after surgery are likely to have a prolonged period of fatigue and general debility. If severely affected by fatigue in the early period of treatment this is only likely to get worse and care needs may be identified. If severe fatigue is present, it is likely that tasks can be physica lly completed but that any task requiring concentration or effort over a period of more than a few minutes will lead to extreme exhaustion and the need for rest and recovery. Tasks such as dressing and preparing food are likely to fall into this category if they take more than a few minutes. Fatigue is particularly likely to affect ability to prepare food when exacerbated by problems such as mouth ulceration, nausea or loss of appetite related to treatment. There may be no motivation to prepare food in the se circumstances and care in the form of encouragement to eat and drink as well as food preparation may be required. Walking distance and exercise tolerance are likely to be reduced compared to normal, but stamina to walk for a few minutes e.g. 100 m from a hospital car park to a hospital ward or clinic will be maintained. There would normally be no need for physical support and no guidance or supervision needs would be present. Back to top of section How long will the needs la st? Once treatment is complete, the chances of recurrent disease depend on the aggressiveness and spread of the original tumour cells. The spread of tumours through the bowel wall is measured very carefully under the microscope and a Dukes' grading given. These measurements are used to make decisions on whether chemotherapy after surgery is necessary and predict the likelihood of the cancer coming back. 5 year survival is 50% over all but varies a lot according to Dukes' stage at diagnosis. Stages A and B People with Dukes' A and B stage tumours are likely to be cured of their disease. Stages C and D People with Dukes' C stage are more likely to have recurrence and people with Dukes' D stage have metastatic spread. If care and mobility needs are iden tified these are likely to be on -going when related to -: recurrent or metastatic disease other disabilities unrelated to bowel cancer Improvement is likely if needs are related to treatment of primary disease. Debility related to treatment is not usually much more than 6 months. However the treatment of rectal cancer is prolonged and needs identified in the early part of treatment are likely to persist through until recovery.

Most primary tumours will be treated wi th surgery or surgery followed by radiotherapy or radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The primary tumour may be completely or partially removed. Most people will have had a craniotomy - the recovery from this type of surgery is described under treatment. In an uncomplicated case, where there was no or minimal neurological impairment before surgery, recovery would be expected to take up to 3 months If a neurological impairment is present on diagnosis, the impairment may get temporarily worse because of the treat ment. Recovery may take much longer than 3 months. Some improvement in impairment is likely with recovery and will be aided by neuro -rehabilitation. Care Care needs may arise due to physical or behavioural neurological impairments. Physical problems may include problems with limb or trunk movement ranging from clumsiness/ unsteady balance to paralysis. There may be paralysis or loss of sensation on one side of the body (hemiplegia), similar to a person who has had a stroke. If the upper limbs are affecte d help may be required with activities of daily living. Severe problems with balance and weakness are likely to make self care, particularly dressing difficult. Preparing food with balance problems is potentially dangerous. Sudden onset of visual impairmen t in addition to the other symptoms of a brain tumour are likely to create or exacerbate care needs. Fits are a common symptom and supervision may be required until fits can be controlled with appropriate medical treatment. Behavioural problems may includ e reduced or absent sense of danger as well as inappropriate or distressing behaviour. Patients often lack motivation and planning strategies for daily activities. Short term memory loss is a frequent feature of brain tumours and their treatment. When beha vioural problems are present regular supervision will be necessary. Symptoms may get worse during treatment but may improve afterwards over several months. Improvement may continue gradually over several years but usually plateaus after maximal rehabilitat ion. Mobility Mobility may be affected in several ways by neurological impairments: Hemiplegia - loss of movement / clumsiness to either side of the body Altered sensation to either side of the body Perceptual neglect of one side of the body Difficulties with balance Poor concentration Central sensory deficits such as blindness or visual field defects and hearing problems. To consider H/R Mobility Severely Visually Impaired (SVI) or deaf/blind deeming provision criteria, click on the link Deeming Provisions . Behavioural problems People with weakness, sensory problems and balance problems may have difficulty walking. They may require assistance or assistive devices and/ or equipment to enable safe mobility and independence. Severe problems with balance may also make walking difficult or dangerous even though they have normal strength and movement in their legs. People with sensory problems may require guidance and supervi sion if their deficit is severe. People with behavioural or cognitive problems may require guidance and supervision because of one of the following Loss of awareness of danger Memory loss Inappropriate behaviour People with difficult to control or unco ntrolled epilepsy may require guidance and supervision in both the home and unfamiliar places. 30% of people with brain tumours do not achieve complete control of their epilepsy. Symptoms may get worse during treatment and can improve afterwards over seve ral months. Improvement may continue gradually over several years but not always completely resolve, particularly memory loss, which can actually continuously worsen following completion of primary treatment. Recurrent brain tumours Brain tumours usually recur because they are either highly malignant or they were in an inaccessible area of the brain and could not be completely removed. Further treatment is likely to be able to control symptoms and slow further progression down; but impairments are less li kely to improve. If needs are identified because of neurological or cognitive impairment indefinite awards are recommended. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Impairment Tumours - benign - other / type not known Brain and spinal cord - cancer of Primary brain tumours There are around 100 different types of brain tumour and prognosis is highly variable between them. For this reason guidance on award duration is provided by tumour diagnosis in the table belo w. In order to use the table the correct histological diagnosis must be known. This information is most likely to be available from the Clinical Nurse Specialist, treating neurosurgeon, treating neuro -oncologist or the GP. Accurate information on impairmen t is most likely to be available from the Clinical Nurse Specialist or GP. For many tumours awards are recommended for one year in the presence of neurological deficits if needs are identified. This is because function may improve significantly over time especially with neurorehabiliation. For example a person may learn how to walk again or their personality may substantially return to normal. Review at one year assesses residual impairment once neurorehabilitation is complete. Once recovery is complete n eeds may be absent or reduced. In cases where disease progresses despite treatment needs are likely to increase. Recurrent brain tumours If needs are identified indefinite awards are recommended. Types of adult brain tumours with information on prognosis. Grade of tumour indicates whether a tumour is benign (G40) or malignant (C51) and if malignant how aggressively it will behave. Name of brain tumour Features Astrocytic tumours There are several different types of astrocytoma. This type of tumour occurs more frequently in people who have had radiation treatment to the head. Pilocytic astrocytoma (WHO grade 1) This is a slow growing type of tumour that has a good prognosis, it is often curable. The main treatment is surgery very occasionally follow ed by radiation therapy. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended. Recovery is expected in the typical case. Diffuse astrocytoma/low -grade diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2) including 3 different subtypes: Fibrillary astrocytoma Gemistocytic astrocytoma These tumours typically affect young adults and are treatable. The mean survival time after surgical treatment is 6-8 years. If needs are identified 1 year time limited Protoplasmic astrocytoma awards are recommended, i f needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. It is recognised that gemistocytic astrocytomas have a worse prognosis and are treated like anaplastic astrocytomas. Anaplastic or malignant astrocytoma (WHO grade 3) Typically affects people around the age of 40 . These tumours can be treatable but not curable. Typically they progress to glioblastoma which is a higher grade tumour within about 2 years. The main treatment is surgery followed by radiation therapy. Young people whose initial treatm ent successfully removes all of the tumour are most likely to do well; although removal of all the tumour with clear margins is unusual. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are re commended. Glioblastoma/ malignant glioma/glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade 4) includes 3 different sub - types: Giant cell glioblastoma Small cell glioblastoma gliosarcoma This is the commonest type of brain tumour - around 20% of all brain tumours. It is one of the most aggressive human cancers and median survival is less than one year. 2 year survival is 5 - 10%.Radiotherapy can prolong median survival from 14 weeks to 38 weeks but may not reverse any disabilities. Rapidly progressive disabil ity is likely, needs are likely. Indefinite awards are recommended in all cases. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma Is very rare it usually affects young adults. Recurrence free survival rates of 71% at 5 years and 61% at 10 years are reported. If needs are id entified 1 year time limited awards are recommended. Recovery can be expected in the typical case. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) (WHO grade 1) Very slow growing treatable tumour that mainly affects people with tuberous sclerosis (a rare genetic disorder). If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended. Recovery is expected in the typical case, however there may be ongoing needs unrelated to the brain tumour in this group. Oligodendroglial tumours: there are two types of this tumour see below - this group has a median postoperative survival time of 3 to 10 years. This type of tumour is likely to be treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy and survival is good if response to treatment is complete. Oligodendroglioma (l ow grade, WHO grade 2)) Well differentiated tumour that often responds well to treatment, recovery is possible in the typical case. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recomme nded. Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO grade 3). Poorly differentiated tumour with a worse outcome than low grade oligodendroglioma. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are reco mmended. Mixed gliomas Oligoastrocytoma (low grade, WHO grade 2) Median survival time with treatment of 6 years. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. Anaplastic Oligoastrocytoma (WHO grade 3) These are high grade tumours with outcomes similar to other malignant astrocytomas. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. Ependymal tumours Myxopapillary ependymoma (WHO grade 1) Commonly affects people aged between 30 and 40. Commonly affects the lower end of the spinal cord - survival is excellent. recovery is expected in the typical case. If needs are identified 1 year t ime limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. Subependymoma (WHO grade 1) Usually affects middle aged and elderly men - usually cured by surgery. Recovery is expected. Needs unlikely. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended Ependymoma (WHO grade 2) Affects young adults. 5 year median survival 57% and 10 year median survival 45%. Can occur in the spine and cause paraplegia that is permanent. Recovery from initial treatment is expected in the typical case. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. Anaplastic ependymoma (WHO grade 3) Prognosis is possibly worst in very young people. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. Neuroepithelial tumours of uncertain origin Astroblastoma Affects young adults. Very rare. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. Choroid glioma of the third ventricle Rare and slow growing but difficult to treat. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. Gliomatosis cerebri Rare. Widely infiltrating aggressive tumour with median survival of less than one year. Rapidly progressive disability is likely, needs are likely. Indefinite awards are recomme nded in all these tumours are very rare. The main treatment is surgery sometimes followed by radiation therapy. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended. Seek medical advice on individual cases. Embryonal tumours Medulloblastoma Affects young adu lts, 5 year survival is between 50% and 70%. Recovery from initial treatment is expected in the typical case. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. Choroid plexus tumours Choroid plexus papilloma Often cured by surgery 5 year survival around 100%. Recovery expected in the typical case. Choroid plexus carcinoma 2 year survival less than 40%. Recovery from initial treatment can be expected in the typical case. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. Pineal parenchymal tumours Pineocytoma Affects young adults. 5 year survival 88%. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended. Recovery is expected in the typical case. Pineoblastoma 5 year survival 58%. Recovery from initial treatment is expected in the typical case. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. Pineal parenchymal tumours of indeterminate differentiation Variable outcome. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recomme nded. Meningeal tumours - these tumours are WHO graded I -III. WHO grade determines prognosis. Meningioma grade I Cured by surgery in 80 -90% of cases. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended. Recovery is expected in the typical case. Meningioma grade II Cured by surgery in 60 -70% of cases. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended. Recovery is expected in the typical case. Meningioma grade III/anaplastic Meningioma Median survival of less than 2 years. If needs identified an indefinite award is recommended. Haemangiopericytoma Responds well to initial treatment but recurs in 90% of cases over 15 years. Recovery from initial treatment is expected in the typical case. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. Indefinite awards recommended on recurrence. Melanocytic lesions Poor prognosis. If needs identified an indefinite award is recommended. Pituitary tumours Benign adenomas of the pituitary gland Around 80% of this group experience resolution of symptoms with treatment. Needs unlikely, recovery expected. Good long term prognosis. Rarely visual field problems will persist after treatment. May require hormone replacement. Carcinomas of the pituitary gland. Median survival of around 2 years. If needs identified an indefinite award is recommended. Craniopharyngoma Good prognosis with combined modality treatment (surgery and radiotherapy). 10 year recurr ence free survival of 60-90%. Needs depend on initial deficits (visual, hypothalamic). If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended, if needs persist on review indefinite awards are recommended. Capillary haemangioblastoma Good progn osis. Most commonly occurs in association with a genetic disorder called von Hippel - Lindau disease. Recovery is expected in the typical case, however there may be ongoing needs unrelated to the brain tumour in this group. Schwannoma/neurilemoma/neurinoma Usually benign tumour often cured by surgery. If needs are identified 1 year time limited awards are recommended. Recovery is expected in the typical case.

Metastatic breast cancer may have no disabling effects whilst un der control with treatment. If not controllable or if it escapes control, disabling effects are likely to increase in both number and severity.

Hospital Factual Report The Cardiac Rehabilitation Nurse Gene ral Practitioners Factual R eport HCP Examination Report Medical Services Hospital Factual Report In all cases of moderate and severe cardiac disease a Consultant Cardiologist, and a Specialist Cardiac Nurse would normally have been involved in the diagnosis, management and treatment of the individual. Indeed the absence of any documented history of a Cardiology consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagno sis. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if required. If the person has undergone a successful catheter ablation, cardioversion, insertion of a pacemaker or defibrillator or other procedure, they will be followed up in the hospital Outpat ient Department, and this will be the best source of information for his/ her residual needs. The Cardiac Rehabilitation Nurse The Cardiac Rehabilitation Nurse is a Specialist nurse , who works in close contact with the Cardio logist, and is part of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Team. She/he is closely involved with the patient, from the start of the hospital stay, and, as well as attending to the physical needs of the patient, is crucial in advising, and supporting the patient. Heart failure patients suffer from an enormous impact on their confidence in their ability to do things, and a large proportion of them suffer from depression, and the Specialist Nurse is there to support them. She/he also can act as an intermediary betwee n the Consultant (and the rest of the team), and the patient, giving advice on medication, dose adjustments, lifestyle, social issues and so on. He/she is also in a position to tell the patient about their illness, and discuss things like prognosis, which may be worrying the patient, as well as being an important issue. This contact is kept up after the patient is discharged, for both medical and psychological reasons; and phone contact, for reassurance of the patient, may take place several times a week, in cases of severe heart failure. At late - stage or end - stage disease, the patient may contact the nurse many times, because of the need for psychological, financial or social support, and for advice on managing often quite complex treatment regimes. Ob viously, the amount of contact varies, with the severity of the condition, and the readiness of the patient to seek help. The Specialist Nurse can also act as a go - between for the patient, GP and Consultant co -ordinating and adjusting the treatment opti ons. Therefore, this role is recognized as being extremely important for the well - being of the patients and more and more hospitals use their services on a permanent basis. General Practitioner Factual report The General Practi tioner would normally have made the initial referral of the claimant to the Cardiologist, and would normally be aware of the results of tests, and current medication. The general practitioner may not have such detailed knowledge of the claimant's needs, if he/ she are more frequently managed by the Consultant Cardiologist, and the Specialist Cardiac Nurse, (who are more likely to have detailed knowledge of exercise tolerance, and the disabling effects of the condition). If there is no specialist health pro fessional involvement or evidence cannot be obtained from them, then a factual report from the claimant's own doctor would be more appropriate. HCP examination Report An HCP examination report would be likely to be necessary when t he person claims significant disability (equivalent to a moderate or severe condition), but there is no supporting evidence from the GP or hospital Specialist; if no corroborative evidence has been able to be obtained; or if it is the only means whereby the claimant's needs can be clarified. Medical Services The Medical Services doctor may be asked to request relevant information such as test results from the GP or Hospital Consultant, and to interpret test results and other information. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Disabling Effects The main disabling effects of arrhythmia are transient as the arrhythmia may be intermittent and can usually be well con trolled by: - Medication, Electrical Cardioversion (ECV), Pacemaker, Surgical ablation of the conduction system. In such cases, the disabling effects are not likely to be significant. However, the underlying cause of the arrhythmia or consequences of the arrhythmia such as a stroke or heart failure may cause disabling effects. If evidence suggests that the customer has heart failure or has had a stroke, which may have resulted from an arrhythmia then go to either Heart Failure guidance or Stroke guidance. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Arrhythmias may cause a lot of symptoms or no symptoms. Benign arrhythmias for which no treatment i s needed usually cause minimal functional impairment. Everyone will have an arrhythmia at some time in their life, the vast majority are not symptomatic, and are usually incidental findings, such as on monitoring. The consequence of arrhythmias may be no ne or they may be life - threatening. Any mobility and care needs are likely to be the result of secondary effects of the arrhythmia such as stroke or heart failure. If evidence suggests that the customer has heart failure or has had a stroke, which may h ave resulted from an arrhythmia then go to either Heart Failure guidance or Stroke guidance.

Back to top of section Arrhythmias in people over 65 As people get older they are more likely to have a cardiac arrhythmia which may be associated with a substantial risk to health. This is often as a result of the process of ageing and changes related to disease, such as ischaem ic heart disease, and changes to the heart's structure. The symptoms may be vague - falls, dizziness, fatigue, blackouts, confusion etc. Atrial fibrillation or flutter is the most common arrhythmia in the elderly. With atrial fibrillation, (as in all ages), stroke prevention (by the use of anticoagulant medication) is very important. Bundle branch block is common in the elderly. It is not normal for an older person to have bradycardia (slow heartbeat) and it is normally indicative of an underlying co nduction disturbance, which may need pacemaker treatment. Tachycardia (fast heartbeat) is less well tolerated in the older person and can precipitate low blood pressure (hypotension), angina and heart failure. The management of arrhythmia in an older per son is basically the same as for people of other age groups but an underlying cause should always be borne in mind. An older person may already be on anti -arrhythmic drugs, (which in themselves may cause an arrhythmia) and is likely to be on other medicat ion; potential drug interactions have to be considered.

What is Cardiomyopathy? Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle caused by damage to, or a change in, the heart muscle structure itself. As a consequence, the heart muscle's pumping ability is affected and other alterations of function may also take place. Cardiomyopathy may present by: - The symptoms it causes, An incidental finding during examinations or screening. The patient may suffer profound psychological consequences, on being given the diagnosis. Cardiomyopathy can be classified into 4 main types: - This is the most common form of cardiomyopathy. The muscle of the left ventricle, and sometimes the right ventricle, becomes weak and slack, so even though the hea rt is bigger (\"enlarged\" or \"dilated\") it cannot pump as effectively. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy In this type of cardiomyopathy, the walls of the heart become thickened (hypertrophy) and stiff. The heart does not fill properly, and this may lead to heart failure, and in some people there is obstruction to the outflow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta, leading to symptoms on exertion. There may be leaking of the mitral valve of the heart. There is a small risk of sudden death, which varies from patient to patient. Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (\"Infiltrative\") This is a rare condition and causes \"stiffness\" of the heart because of a stiffening of the walls of the ventricles. This impedes filling of the heart. Many of the features of restrictive card iomyopathy are similar to those of hypertropic cardiopathy. Arrhythmogenic Right Ventriclular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) This disease has been recently acknowledged and is a disease of the heart muscle which usually affects the right ventricle more then the lef t ventricle. Heart muscle cells are replaced by scarring and fat cells. The right ventricle usually becomes weakened and arrhythmias may occur. In some forms of cardiomyopathy, clots form in the heart, and may break off and travel to other parts of the bo dy (as emboli). If an embolus blocks a blood vessel to the brain, a stroke may result. If evidence suggests that the customer has heart failure, which may have resulted from cardiomyopathy then follow Heart Failure guidance. If evidence suggests that the customer has had a stroke, which may have resulted from valvular heart disease then follow Stroke guidance . Back to top of section What evidence is available?

Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Disabling Effects The main disabling effects of cardiomyopathy are a consequence of the illness such as heart failure or angina due to inadequate blood supply to the heart muscle even where the coronary arteries are healthy. The main disabling effect s are due to heart failure. If evidence suggests that the customer has heart failure, which may have resulted from cardiomyopathy then follow Heart Failure guidance . In some forms of cardiomyopathy, clots form in the heart, and may break off and travel to other parts of the body (as emboli). If an embolus blocks a blood vessel to the brain, a stroke may result. If evidence suggests that the customer has had a stroke, which may have resulted from cardiomyopathy then fol low Stroke guidance. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? The following gives details of the medical course of each type of cardiomyopathy. Dilated Cardiomyopathy Prognosis is hugely var iable. Life expectancy is likely to be reduced, especially if heart failure symptoms are present. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common reason for heart transplant. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Prognosis is variable, but often there is a slow deteriorat ion; many patients are symptomless for much of their lives. Sudden death may occur at any age, but the annual mortality is highest in children and adolescents (up to 6%). It usually occurs during or just after strong physical activity. About 4% of people, overall, with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy die each year. An Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) is felt to be an effective treatment for the prevention of sudden death and therefore should be offered to high - risk cases. This is because it is tho ught that ventricular arrhythmias are the cause of many cases of sudden death. Amiodarone is used in less risky cases of sudden death. Death from chronic heart failure is less common. No pharmacological treatment will change the clinical course of the disease, though symptoms (such as in atrial fibrillation and heart failure) may be alleviated. Restrictive Cardiomyopathy This disease usually occurs in elderly patients. Life expectancy is reduced. Heart Transplantation may be indicated, but for young patient s only. Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) Prognosis is hugely variable because of the different degrees of severity of the disease. Many people are virtually unaffected but some are more seriously affected and may be at risk of sudden death. The condition may progress or it may improve. If evidence suggests that the customer has heart failure, which may have resulted from cardiomyopathy then follow Heart Failure guidance . If evidence suggests that the cust omer has had a stroke, which may have resulted from cardiomyopathy then follow Stroke guidance . Impairment Date of Onset Award Period Cardiomyopathy causing Heart Failure N/A Indefinite Cardiomyopathy causing Stroke Less than 2 years 2 year award More than 2 years Indefinite Cardiomyopathy - Other complications N/A Indefinite All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Cardiomyopathy in people over 65 There is an increased incidence of ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy in elderly patients, (10% of people w ho develop dilated cardiomyopathy are likely to be over 65 years). This is because of diffuse coronary artery disease; the heart muscle is deprived of blood supply, and the end result is scar tissue replacing the ischaemic muscle with hypertrophy of the remaining muscle to compensate. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may occur as a result of the deposition of amyloid protein in the heart, and amyloidosis is more common in older people. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy occurs in about 4% of older people, and this figure may be an underestimate. Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) usually affects younger people.

However, in the minority of cases where disability may have occurred (see ADL and Mobility needs ), then it may be necessary to request a factual report from the customer's own General Practitioner. Activities of Daily Living an d Mobility needs The median nerve is responsible for sensation in most of the palm of the hand, apart from the area under the little finger, and for certain thumb movements - i.e. lifting the thumb vertically away from the palm, (abduction), and moving th e thumb across the palm of the hand towards the little finger (opposition). Loss of function of the median nerve due to carpal tunnel syndrome will give rise to varying degrees of impairment of manual dexterity, particularly activities involving pinch or key grip. Many individuals with carpal tunnel syndrome will experience mild and intermittent symptoms in the early stages of the condition. The dominant hand is usually affected first, tends to develop the worst symptoms and may be the only hand affected. However, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome can affect both hands. Even though the worst symptoms are normally experienced in the dominant hand, the degree of functional impairment would normally be minimal in the majority of cases. Specifically such individuals woul d normally be able to dress and undress unaided, and be able to manipulate small objects, such as buttons and zips, although there is a tendency to drop items. Aspects of main meal preparation including peeling and chopping vegetables and lifting pans are unlikely to be significantly impaired. There would normally be no significant restriction of self -care activities. A minority of cases will have disability. This tends to occur where the condition is longstanding and treatment has not been sought. In such cases severe muscle wasting at the base of the thumb occurs together with marked loss of sensation of most of the palm of the hand. This causes considerable difficulties with manual dexterity. Back to top of section How lon g will the needs last? Whilst there would normally be no significant restriction of self -care activities, a minority of cases will have disability. In cases where significant nerve damage and muscle wasting at the base of the thumb has occurred, full rec overy is unlikely.

Some may develop long term side effects of treatment. Stage 1 and 2 disease Five year survival from stage 1 disease is about 80 -95%. Five year survival from stage 2 disease is 60 -90%. Long term side effects of treatment are infertility and early menopause. Because this group has good long term survival they are likely to develop proportionately more of the long term side effects from their radiotherapy treatment. There are unlikely to be any long term care and mobility needs after initial treatment. The exception to this is the enduring but rare side effects of chemotherapy and long term effects of pelvic radiotherapy. Needs are likely to arise when disease recurs. Stage 3 disease Five yea r survival from stage 3 disease is 30 -50%. Long term disabling effects include the side effects of radiotherapy particularly on the bladder and bowel which may develop some years after treatment. Recurrent disease is common and may occur quite soon after treatment of initial disease - up to date medical evidence from the treating hospital will be important. Stage 4 disease Stage 4A disease means the cancer has spread to other organs in the pelvis, there are likely to be disabling effects including problems with the bowel and bladder related to invasion by cancer. Treatment is likely to include chemotherapy, radical radiotherapy and/or major surgery. Radical treatment for advanced disease typically has more side effects than treatment of ea rly disease. Long term survival is poor. Stage 4B disease means metastases have occurred, any of the disabling effects of metastatic disease may be present, she may be terminally ill. 5 year survival is about 16%. Metastatic disease and recurrent disease a fter treatment of any stage of cervical cancer. This person is likely to be terminally ill although the expected survival may be longer than six months. There may be disabling effects from metastatic disease anywhere in the body including -: Liver metastas es - these may cause fatigue and in the later stages, mental confusion, abdominal swelling or pain and jaundice Lung metastases or malignant pleural effusion - may cause very disabling breathlessness reducing mobility to a few yards. Brain metastases - these may cause fits, personality change, confusion, difficulties with balance, walking and self care Bone metastases - pain and pathological fractures Problems specifically related to advanced cervical cancer or its treatment may include: Lymphoedema of the lower limbs, this is likely to affect ability to walk.

The following describes the typical problems with daily living activities for the majority of the time. Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Mobility The ability to walk long distances may be reduced, but the person is likely to be able to walk short distances on an unrestricted basis most of the time. Their judgment, thought processes and means of communicating are not affected to the extent that they would be unable to find their way around in familiar and unfamiliar places. ADL The person would normally to be able to wash, dress, bathe, use the toilet, get up and downstairs without difficulty. The ability to plan a meal is not impaired and the tasks involving in preparing and cooking food are unlikely to be restricted in any way. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Mobility The ability to walk more than 100 metres consistently may be restricted in moderate cases, but severe restriction of walking is unlikely. Their judgment, thought processes and means of communicating are not affected to the extent that they would be unable to find their way around in familiar and unfamiliar places. ADL Those with a moderate level of functional restriction would be expected to be able to manage some personal care and preparation of food without help from another person most of the time. Tasks may take longer than normal and may need to be followed by a period of rest. Although the level of fatigue and symptom severity may vary during the day or from day to day, the ability to maintain personal hygiene and nutrition is likely to be unimpaired. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Mobility Such claimants may be severely restricted in their ability to walk. There may a requirement for supervision either at home or out of doors as a result of significant cognitive impairment, but it would be uncommon. ADL People with a severe level of functional restriction, who spend most of the day in bed or otherwise immobile, and wh o may have clinically evident muscle wasting, may well need help with personal care and preparing food. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? People with mild illness may recover spontaneously, or with some general advice or a limited treatment programme over the course of the following six months. These people are likely to be treated in a general practice setting. People with established CFS/ME of moderate severity lasting one to two years or more are like ly to need a more extensive management programme, as described above, lasting 6 to 12 months or more. Most people who are able to attend hospital for treatment are likely to make a significant improvement with appropriate management. Some people will recov er fully, but others will not achieve their previous level of functioning. Some may not improve. Those who recover may be at risk of recurrence. Those who improve are at risk of relapse. In many patients, disability and quality of life can be improved, som etimes to a significant extent. Severe cases are less likely to recover completely or benefit substantially from a management programme. Indicators of a good prognosis are: - Male sex, A definite history of an acute viral illness like glandular fever at the onset, Mild disability and few symptoms, Clinical features showing a pattern of evolution towards functional recovery, Early diagnosis aimed at eliminating associated physical disorders and/or identifying psychiatric illness along with other complicati ng psychological or social factors, A management approach which may encompass physical, psychological and social elements that allows a stepwise approach to functional improvement using rehabilitation. Indicators of a poor prognosis are: - Onset of sympto ms without any clear precipitating factor, Clinical features characterised by severe and unremitting symptoms, Severe and persistent disability, A management approach that overemphasises the importance of either complete rest or which advocates a rapid ret urn to pre -illness levels of physical activity, Those with co -morbid significant medical conditions or mood disorders, A complex background of adverse psychological and social factors.

Reports can be obtained from Consultants or specialist nurses working in gastro -enterology or specialist liver clinics. People with early or mild disease may be predominantly under the care of their general practition ers. Some with cirrhosis who misuse alcohol may not attend their hospital visits for monitoring. It may be possible to obtain some information on their physical condition from the community alcohol teams who care for their psychological health. It may be helpful to seek advice from Medical Services if the diagnosis of the condition causing cirrhosis is not clear. Treatment options and prognosis are determined to a significant extent by the underlying disease. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Following diagnosis, while symptoms are mild or minimal the person is unlikely to have any functional limitations. As the condition progresses with increasing impairment of liver function, muscle weakness, fatigue, weight loss and poor over all physical condition, individuals may have difficulties in washing, dressing, climbing stairs, preparing food and walking, and a propensity to fall. Late complications of liver failure that impair cognitive function (e.g. drowsiness, disorientation, abno rmal behaviour) may lead to a need for supervision.

Cirrhosi s often develops insidiously over many years with the person having few or no symptoms. Once established the outlook tends to be unpredictable; it depends on the underlying disease process. Repeated hospital admissions for treatment of complications are as sociated with a poor outlook. In those who continue to consume alcohol the prognosis is very poor (65% mortality within 5 years). Some people who undergo liver transplantation will have a good outlook. Development of hepato -cellular carcinoma has a poor pr ognosis.

Activities of Daily Living and Mobility nee ds Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects The person normally has little or no symptoms. They would normally have wheeziness and breathlessness on a less than daily basis and would usually only suffer from a mild \"smoker's cough\", producing some mucoid sputum . They may become breathless on moderate, prolonged or heavy exertion. Mobility A person with mild restriction would normally be able to walk an unlimited distance, at a normal pace and manner on level ground, and manage hills or slopes. There would be no need for guidance and supervision whilst outdoors. ADL Daily living would normally be unaffected, with the patient being able to attend to all daily activities of self -care without any difficulty. This includes bathing, dressing, attending to hygiene and toilet needs, and being able to prepare and cook a main meal. He/ she would normally be able to climb one flight of stairs. They would not normally be at risk of falls. Occasionally, the person may have an episode of chest infection, which may cause some difficulty with exercise tolerance, but this would only occur for the minority of the time. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects The person would normally suffer from wheeziness and breathlessness for part of each day. Because he/ she would normally be breathless on extra activity, he/ she would have to take things more slowly. He/ she could also be incapacita ted by exacerbations (chest infect ions), where cough and breathlessness are increased, but this is for the minority of the time. Mobility A person with moderate restriction would normally be unable to keep up with others when walking on the level. However, he/ she may be able to walk up to 100 to 200 metres, as long as he/she walks at a slow pace. There would be no need for guidanc e and supervision while out of doors. ADL A person with moderate restriction would normally have breathlessness as a noticeable and troublesome symptom. Howev er, this would not normally affect such activities as rising from a bed or chair, bathing, dressing, attending to toilet needs, and being able to prepare and cook a main meal to a significant degree. These people are susceptible to chest infections especia lly following a cold, and for a few days, or weeks, this could cause him/her to be very breathless and he/she may normally need assistance with some of these activities at this time. Normally, a customer would be breathless climbing one flight of stairs (t hat is, on mild or ordinary exertion) but they would be able to manage this activity at their own pace. However, during periods of chest infection they would have greater difficulty in climbing a flight of stairs but this would not be for most of the time. People with this condition would not normally be susceptible to falls. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects Cognitive function would not usually be affected therefore the person is mentally able to cope, on the whole. However, in those who are retaining CO2 (carbon dioxide), cognitive function may be impaired. Because of inability to eat normally, there usually is severe weight loss or malnutrition . Patients suffering from very severe disease would have severe br eathlessness on minimal exertion and be on oxygen for several hours a day (unless in CO2 retention i.e. when there is a presence of more than the normal amount of carbon dioxide in the blood tissues). Oxygen is not prescribed in these circumstances. Mobil ity A person with severe restriction would normally experience severe breathlessness on walking any distance. He/ she would not normally be able to walk more than 50 metres at the most, at a very slow pace. There may be a risk of falls. ADL A person with severe restriction would normally require assistance in all aspects of daily self -care, such as getting in or out of a bed, chair, or the bath, washing, dressing, including lower garments and fastenings, attending to toilet needs, and some aspects of prepa ring and cooking a main meal such as bending to an oven and carrying and lifting hot saucepans because of severe breathlessness on minimal exertion. He/she would normally not be able to get him/herself comfortable in bed without assistance. In addition, th e person would not normally be able to manage one flight of stairs. Some of the time, communication may be affected, because of severe breathlessness, and the person may not be able to cope with aspects of their medical treatment, such as the administratio n of oxygen, without assistance. The person would normally need assistance in eating and drinking. There may be a risk of falls and the person would not normally be capable of rising independently from a fall. Click on the link below for details of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnoea scale -: http://www.gp -training.net/protocol/respiratory/copd/dyspnoea_scale.htm Back to top of sec tion How long will the needs last? Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease (COAD) and Emphysema are chronic progressive disorders characterised by airflow limitation. They are essentially progressive conditions, which worsen with time, especially if the perso n continues to smoke. Pulmonary rehabilitation (to achieve optimum fitness) can reduce symptoms and improve function. Controlled oxygen therapy for more than 15 hours a day has been shown to increase survival significantly. Smoking cessation is the singl e most effective intervention to reduce the risk of further development. Cessation of smoking may slow the decline in lung function to normal levels of decline in a relatively short time. This would not affect the prognosis of moderate and severe disease b ecause the damage is done, but may improve the prognosis in mild disease. The prognosis in moderate and severe COPD therefore, is likely to be life - long with consequent care and mobility needs, which will not improve as the disease is progressive and the person is likely to gradually deteriorate. COAD, chronic bronchitis and emphysema At first the only symptom for many years may be a \"smoker's cough\". This symptom progresses to cough with sputum, wheeze and breathlessness. Chest infections occur more and more regularly with colds causing the production of purulent sputum. These infections increase in severity and duration until a cough is constantly present. With progression of the disease, the person experiences increasing breathlessness on exertion. With advanced disease, breathlessness becomes severe and occurs at rest and normally affects all aspects of daily life. At end -stage disease, the person is bed -bound or chair -bound and likely to be on oxygen for several hours a day. It is a chronic, slowl y progressive disorder with little variation over a period of time. Bronchodilator therapy may help the degree of airflow obstruction to some extent as most patients have some degree of asthmatic -type responsiveness to bronchodilators. 20 -30% of patients improve somewhat when given a course of steroids and inhaled corticosteroids may be indicated. Long - term oral corticosteroid treatment should normally be avoided. The disease is regarded as being progressive, with a continuous steady decline in lung funct ion. Emphysema The best predictor of survival is the FEV1 after bronchodilator use. Emphysema gradually develops over a number of years. People with emphysema have great difficulty in exhaling (breathing out). Symptoms such as shortness of breath (sometimes associated with wheeze) occur initially on exertion and then as the disease progresses with little exertion and ultimately at rest. The person eventually may not be able to carry out basic activities in a normal fashion. With advanced disease, b reathlessness becomes severe and occurs at rest and normally affects all aspects of daily life. At end -stage disease, the person is bed -bound or chair -bound and likely to be on oxygen for several hours a day. It is a chronic, slowly progressive disorder w ith little variation over a period of time. Bronchodilator therapy may help those who have a tendency to airways constriction. Some patients improve somewhat when given a course of steroids and inhaled corticosteroids may be indicated. Long - term oral co rticosteroid treatment should be avoided. No medication has been shown to restore lost lung function. Impairment Award Period Chronic bronchitis Indefinite award Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease (COAD) Emphysema All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Over 65 COAD, chronic bronchitis and emphysema Because Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease (COAD) and Emphysema are slowly progressive conditions, they are more common in older people, especially those with a significant smoking history. Stopping smoking, even in late r life, is likely to improve life expectancy and slow the rate of decline of lung function. The conditions can be under -diagnosed and under -treated and may present late, as older people may not perceive the feeling of breathlessness so well, and may just believe that breathlessness is a normal consequence of ageing; alternatively, the presentation may not be typical, as they may experience breathlessness at night, rather than wheeze. With moderate to severe disease, there is an increased energy output, an d people thus affected require an increased calorie intake (by at least 50%) in the form of carbohydrate and fat. Poor nutrition is more likely to occur in the elderly, (because of isolation, mobility problems, reduced cognitive function, or communication problems, for example ). The elderly therefore, are likely to be more severely affected than a younger person, and more at risk of deterioration in their general condition. The adverse side effects that may occur with the use of steroids are of even more relevance in the elderly; for example, they may easily become confused or even psychotic, and if they already have existing osteoporosis, it could be worsened, and there may be an increased risk of fracture of the hip. The treatment in the elderly is the same. Emphysema Inadequate assessment of a person's emphysema, which may occur as a result of his/ her reduced cognitive function, or communication problems, may lead to their not receiving adequate and appropriate treatment, such as long - term oxygen the rapy. Pulmonary rehabilitation, which involves a multidisciplinary approach, aims to improve functional capacity as much as possible, especially in the elderly, who are particularly likely to benefit from a programme of exercise, oxygen therapy, improved nutrition, and information about their condition.

General practitioners are able to provide reports for people with mild disease whose exacerbations respond readily to standard drug therapies or who are in remission. People wi th perianal problems such as abscesses and fistulas may attend practice or community nurses for regular treatment and dressings. People with Crohn's disease which relapses regularly and those with more severe disease, attend Gast roenterology clinics for regular monitoring. Care will be shared with surgical colleagues when operations are needed to treat complications. Reports may be obtained from Consultant s and Specialist Ga stroenterology Nurses working in these clinics. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs People in remission, people with mild disease and those whose exacerbations respond quickly to medication are unlikely to have any long term functional restrictions affecting their ability to walk or provide self care. Some people with disease of moderate severity may be restricted in their ability to stand, bend/kneel and walk around due to abdominal pain and the effects of complications such as fistula s. These individuals are likely to be taking more potent drugs, have frequent exacerbations of abdominal pain and diarrhoea and be attending hospital regularly. Some may need help with dressings and treatments from nurses. They may be restricted in their a bility to self -care, including preparation of meals if symptoms last for some months or fail to respond to standard drug regimes. It is unlikely however that walking would be severely restricted since lower limb function is normal. Anxiety and concern abou t diarrhoea and needing to locate a toilet when out are not considered to be an indication that guidance or supervision are necessary. People with the most severe disease are constitutionally unwell, have low body weight, evidence of malnutrition, decrea sed muscle bulk and persistent pain. These individuals have progressive disease with complications that have failed to respond to both medical treatments and surgery. They are likely to need help with self care and some will have considerable restriction i n walking. Further details on NHS Choices -: Bowel Incontinence Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Some people have mild symptoms and exacerbations resolve quickly with medication. Up to 10% have a prolonged remission with minimal effects on long term health. However 75% of cases have recurrent episodes of varying severity lasting over many years. About one eighth ha ve progressive disease without remission. Ultimately 2% are considered to have very severe disease with debilitating pain, weight loss, poor general health and development of complications. They often fail to respond to any of the standard drug therapies . At the present time no medical or surgical treatment is considered to be curative. Overall the excess mortality due to active disease is approximately double that of the general population. Crohn's disease is recognised to predispose to cancers of th e small and large intestines. In cases where there is severe unremitting disease with weight loss, poor general health and complications there is unlikely to be any improvement in the Care and Mobility needs. All information must be taken into account w hen considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Over 65 Elderly people with moderate or severe Crohn's disease may also have considerable care needs. They may need help to: - move around the house get upstairs get on and off the toilet with personal hygiene, dressing, and bathing. using pads and waterproof pants to control faecal incontinence if diarrhoea is persistent or limited mobility slows down access to the toilet. Frail elderly, especially if underweight or subject to poor nutrition/malabsorption, will need assistance with medication, encouragement to maintain adequate nutrition and fluid intake, and may also be prone to fa lls.

Linked pages -: Ageing Falls Frailty Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs The main symptom of chronic suppurative otitis media is the persistent discharge from the ear. The patient will need to carry out regular cleansing of the external ear and may need to apply drops several times a day. Regular visits to surgery or a hospital outpatients department may be needed for cleansing of the ear canal (aural toil et) until the discharge has dried up. In the majority of cases needing only simple management of the condition there should be no need for help with personal bodily functions unless the person suffers another condition affecting the ability to manage the problem. In such cases any needs would form part of the requirements of the associated condition and should be assessed in that context. Complications such as hearing loss may produce a need for help with communication and learning. The specific functional effects of hearing loss are covered as a separate topic. Tinnitus can be a distressing symptom for some but unless it is severe or precipitates a psychological condition such as anxiety or depression it should not produce any care needs in its own right. The care needs of any psychological problems should be assessed on their own merit. Uncomplicated chronic suppurative otitis media should not produce factors that adversely affecting walking ability. In complicated cases where the organs of the vestibular balance organs are affected there is a potential for mobility to be disrupted by episodic vertigo (giddiness) but this again would need to be assessed on its own merit. Children with chronic suppurative otitis media or indeed recurrent acute otitis media may develop behavioural disorders associated with pain or hearing loss but needs generated by abnormal behaviour also would have to be considered as a separate entity. Variability Chronic suppurative otitis media tends to run a protracted cours e over several months with episodes of acute infection sometimes being superimposed on the clinical picture. Apart from short term problems generated by the acute illness there should be no significant variation in the condition or level of care needed. How long will the needs last? Chronic suppurative otitis media generally responds well to treatment although this may have to be continued over several months. Significant complications of acute or chronic suppurative otitis media include brain abscess or i nfection in the temporal bone of the skull but these occur in only a very small number of cases. The overall prognosis for all forms of otitis media is excellent.

However, if further details are needed, the Specialist Nurse or Consultant is an appropriate source of information. The claimant may be sup ported by the Care Programme Approach (CPA) and hold written information outlining the level of external support required, which is a useful first source of further medical evidence. Activities of Daily Living and Mo bility needs The following tables present pen pictures of customers' likely mobility and care needs at varying levels of functional severity Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects The person may have -: Low mood that is characteristically worse in the evening than in the morning. Lack of energy, interest and irritability. Associated anxiety, phobias and obsessional symptoms may also be present and they may experience difficulty going to sleep or periods of wakening during the night. Mobility People would normally have no difficulty finding their way around outdoors because they do not usually experience any confusion, inattention, memory loss or impaired judgement. There would be no physical restriction of walking ability. ADL People would normally be expected to care for themselves by maintaining personal hygiene and preparing meals etc. They would have little or no functional limitation on a day -to-day basis arising from any symptoms nor would they need supervisi on or watching over to prevent abnormal or untoward behaviour. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a moderate restriction will display 2 out of 3 of the following -: Depressed mood Loss of enjoyment Fatiguability and at least 4 of the following -: Reduced concentration and attention Reduced self esteem and self confidence Ideas of guilt and unworthiness Bleak and pessimistic views of the future Ideas of self harm or suicide Disturbed sleep Reduced appetite However, people with a moderate restriction would not normally exhibit -: Significant self neglect Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions Significant slowing of movements or agitation Mobility Agoraphobia, physical inertia and apathy may require someone to encourage the moderately depressed person to get out and about. Those people with associated agoraphobia or severe anxiety may have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and may require support. ADL The following care requirements would normally be reasonably required -: Encouragement to prepare a cooked main meal. Encouragement to go out and engage in social activities. Encouragement to take medication, but this i s likely to be limited to once or twice a day. Note: In the great majority of cases any evident care needs will only be for a limited period, which is unlikely to exceed several months during any one episode. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects They may have -: Severely depressed mood Prominent biological symptoms such as loss of appetite weight and sleep disturbance Severe agitation or significant slowing of movements. There may also be -: Significant impairment of concentration and memory possibly resulting in confusion, psychotic symptoms such as delusions of guilt, worthlessness or poverty, persecutory hallucinations and significant social withdrawal. Insight is likely to be limited. Mobility If there is significant impairment of concentration, insight, judgement or memory or psychosis or psychomotor retardation present, there may be a need for guidance or supervision. Apart from the rare occurrence of depressive stupor, (motionless and mute) there would be no physical restriction of walking ability. People with depressive stupor will be hospitalized and usually respond to treatment within a period of weeks. ADL If there is significant impairment of concentration and motivation and/or presence of psychosis or psychomotor retardation the customer may require -: Help to plan and prepare a main meal. They would normally also need prompting to go to bed, use the toilet, deal with incontinence, maintain hygiene and appearance, wash and dry, use the bath and shower, dress, move around indoors, use the stairs, get in and out of a chair, eat and drink and use medication or medical treatment. Help with communication may be required and there may be an increased risk of suicide. (For further information please see section on self -harm). Back to top of section How long will the needs last? The average length of a depressive episode is about 6 months but about 25% of people have episodes lasting more than a year and about 10 -20% develop a chronic unremitting course. It is not possible to specify with accuracy the duration of any individual depressive episode, as people with severe disability usually respond well to treatment. For infrequent repeated episodes it would be reasonable to award for a limited period initially whilst awaiting the outcome of response to treatment. In the great majority of cases any evident care needs will only be for a limited period, which is unlikely to exceed several month s during any one episode. There is evidence that the prognosis is worse in older people. Criteria that indicate chronicity in depressive Illness The following are associated with an increased likelihood that depression will be chronic -: Increased sever ity Longer duration Older age (especially over 60) Impairment Date of Onset Award Period Customers under 50 years of age -: Depressive Illness (disorder) Less than 5 years 2 year award More than 5 years 5 year award Customers over 50 years of age -: Depressive Illness (disorder) Less than 5 years 2 year award More than 5 years Indefinite award Post Natal Depression N/A 1 year award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individu al claimant. Back to top of section Depressive illness in people over 65 Depression is common in the elderly. However, the first onset of depressive illness becomes less common after the age of 60 and rare after the age of 80. The incidence of suicide increases with age and suicide in the elderly is usually associated with depressive illness. Clinical features are similar to those in younger people, but some symptoms are more prominent in the elderly and these include: Retardation and agitation, Cognitive impairment, Delusions (False beliefs that are unshakeable) concerning poverty and physical illness. Occasionally there are nihilistic delusion such as the belief that the body is empty, non existent or not fun ctioning. Hallucinations may be accusatory or obscene. Depressive symptoms may not be conspicuous and the person may present with hypochondriasis, anxiety or confusion. A small proportion may present with pseudodementia i.e. they have difficulty with con centrating and remembering but formal testing of memory demonstrates no significant deficit. The prognosis for depressive illness in the elderly is poorer than that for younger people. About 85 percent display considerable improvement within a few months. The other 15 percent do not recover completely. Of the 85 percent that initially recover: One third remain completely well, One third have further depressive episodes with complete remission between episodes, One third become chronically disabled by depr ession. Poor outcome is associated with: Onset over the age of 70, Long duration of illness, Associated physical illness, Poor recovery from previous episodes, Associated organic brain pathology, Poor compliance with treatment, Serious coincidental life events, The principles of treatment are the same as that for younger adults. Certain modifications are required in the elderly, for example, physical disorders should be effectively treated; ECT is more frequently used and is an effecti ve treatment of severe depressive illness in the elderly; Antidepressant medication dose should be specifically tailored and life long treatment should be considered following the first episode of depressive illness.

He/she is closely involved with the patient, from the start of attendance at the hospital clinic, and, as well as attending to the physical needs of the patient, is crucia l in advising, and supporting the patient. The Diabetic Specialist Nurse may have more contact with the patient, than the Consultant, through informal contact and phone calls, (especially in the cases of teenagers and young adults, who do not wish to have too much contact with the hospital). Some diabetic patients suffer from depression, and the Specialist Nurse is there to support them, and refer onwards, to a Psychologist or Psychiatrist, if necessary. She also can act as an intermediary between the Cons ultant (and the rest of the team), and the patient, giving advice on medication, dose adjustments, lifestyle, social issues and so on. He/she is also in a position to tell the patient about their illness, and discuss things like prognosis, which may be wor rying the patient, as well as being an important issue. This contact is kept up after the patient is discharged, for both medical and psychological reasons; and phone contact, for reassurance of the patient, may take place frequently. Obviously, the amoun t of contact varies, with the severity of the condition, and the readiness of the patient to seek help. The Specialist Nurse can also act as a go - between for the patient, GP and Consultant co -ordinating and adjusting the treatment options. Therefore, this role is recognised as being extremely important for the well - being of the patients and more and more hospitals use their services on a permanent basis. Hospital Factual Report In all cases of moderate and severe diabetic disease a Consultant Diabetologist, and a Specialist Diabetic Nurse would normally have been involved in the diagnosis, management and treatment of the individual. In the presence of established complications, there will be involvement with a Consultant Cardiologist , Consultant Vascular Surgeon, Consultant Nephrologist, Consultant Ophthalmologist, and/ or Consultant Neurologist, (depending on the degree and type of complications). The absence of any documented history of a Consultant consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if required. If a person has undergone a successful operation or procedure, such as a Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA), a Co ronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), angioplasty of peripheral artery, cataract operation, laser treatment for retinopathy, dialysi s or renal transplant, the claimant will be followed up in the hospital Outpatient Department, and this will be the best source of information for his/ her residual needs. General Practitioner Factual report The Practitioner would normally have made the in itial referral of the claimant to the Diabetologist, and would normally be aware of the results of tests and current medication. The general practitioner may not have such detailed knowledge of the claimant's needs if he/ she is more frequently managed by the Consultant Diabetologist, and the Specialist Diabetic Nurse, (who are more likely to have detailed knowledge of the disabling effects of the condition). If there is no specialist health professional involvement or evidence cannot be obtained from them , then a factual report from the claimant's own doctor would be more appropriate. HCP examination Report An HCP examination report would be likely to be necessary when t he person describes multiple complications for, which factual re ports provide inadequate evidence to enable the assessment of functional restrictions; or if it is the only means whereby the claimant's needs can be clarified. Medical Services The Services doctor may be asked to request relevant information such as test results from the GP or Hospital Consultant and to interpret test results and other information. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects In the case of diabetic patients, with mild functional restriction, the aim of treatment is for patients to have good glycaemia control. They can manage their own monitoring and treatment, (including hypo's), and do not suffer from compli cations. Mobility There should be no difficulty in walking, and no difficulty in getting about in an unfamiliar area. ADL Such a person would normally be able to look after all aspects of self - care with regard to bodily functions (such as bathing and showering, dressing, attending to his/her own toilet needs, planning, preparing and cooking a main meal, and going up and down stairs.) Without vision complications he/she should also be able to check and administer his/her own insulin. He/she normally wo uld have warning of \"hypo's\", (hypoglycaemic episodes - low blood sugar), and be in a position to take the necessary steps to avoid or curtail them. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects In such a person, with moderate functional restriction due to their diabetes, some complications affecting vision, cardiovascular (e.g. the heart), peripheral vascular (e.g. the blood vessels in the legs) or neurological systems (e.g. the nerves, and nerve pathways), may be present. At this stage, renal (kidney) effects would not be likely to be obvious or debilitating. The person should be able to monitor and treat his/ her own disease, unless vision is affected to a severe extent. They would normally be able to cope with hypo' s themselves. Mobility The person may be affected by angina and/or peripheral vascular disease and/or reduced foot sensation, to some degree. However, he/she would normally be able to walk more than 100 metres on the flat, without stopping. Some individuals may have problems with reading signs, but on the whole, a person with diabetes with moderate disabling effects would normally be able to get about, unaided, in an unfamiliar place, as they can ask for directions. ADL A person with moderate restriction should be able to look after his/her self - care needs, relating to bodily functions, as vision would not be significantly affected to impact on general care, such as dressing, bathing/ showering, attending to toilet needs or planning and cooking a main meal. Cardiovascular and vascular effects on exertion, and neurological impairment, at this stage, would not be enough to seriously affect the above activities. There is a chance that a person with a visual impairment might need a visual aid for r eading labels and recipes, and checking medication strength and levels in the syringe, but this depends on the individual's disablement. Normally, he/she should be able to manage stairs, but may have to take them more slowly, and stop and rest, either half way, or at the top. Such a person would normally recognise hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar), and have a sugar source available to take at all times, in case of such an event. Night hypoglycaemia can be avoided as much as possible, in these people, by their checking their blood glucose level before going to bed, and having a snack if necessary. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects A person with severe functional restriction may display evidence of long - term raised blood sugar, and fats, as well as proteinuria. Conversely, they may have good control at the present time, but be suffering from severe complications, (because of poor glycaemic control in the past). Such a person is likely to be suffering from significan t complications affecting one or all of the following systems. 1) the heart (coronary artery disease, leading to angina requiring treatment), 2) the peripheral blood vessels, especially in the legs, leading to narrowing of the vessels, and poor circulatio n of the feet or legs, 3) the nerve pathways especially affecting the lower limbs, making the patient susceptible to damage to these areas, without being aware, 4) eye complications causing vision to be affected, 5) kidney complications, causing diabetic nephropathy, which may progress to kidney (renal) failure. He/ She may need assistance with monitoring, and treatment of his/ her condition, and may not be aware of the onset of hypo's. Mobility Each person would need to be assessed according to how the diabetes has affected that person. If the person has angina and/or narrowing of the arteries in the legs (leading to cramp on walking), or nerve damage leading to pins and needles and weakness in the legs), they might be only able to manage a walking distance of 30 metres or less. With amputation (s) he/she may be confined to a wheelchair, and not be able to walk at all. If he/ she has (or is getting used to) a prosthesis, walking may be quite severely compromised, at least for a few months. A person w ith severe visual effects resulting from the condition may have great difficulty in getting around out of doors unaided, may not be able to read street or road signs, and in fact may be registered blind. They may also satisfy the H/R Mobility criteria und er the Severely Visually Impaired (SVI) deeming provisions. Click on the link H/R Mobility Severely Visually Impaired (SVI) deeming provisions . ADL Each person would need to be assessed according to how the diabetes has affected that person. He/she would normally still be able to dress him/herself, but may need assistance getting out of the bath, or helping with showering, if there is significant problems with the nerve pathways in the feet, or indeed, amputations. He/she may need assistance with testing their own blood and reading the result, with administering insulin and with checking and taking tablet medication, if vision is significantly affected. If the heart and/or peripheral circulation in the legs is affected, he/she may have difficulty managing stairs without assistance. If amputations of one or both legs have occurred, he/ she may need assistance on the stairs, as they may not have adjusted well to a prosthetic limb, or using stairs may not b e an option at all, except by stair lift. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? There is no cure for Diabetes. The condition is managed by insulin, tablets or diet. The only problem with self - care in a small number of people with uncomplicated diabetes is hypoglycaemic attacks without warning. This is more likely to occur with longstanding diabetes, as neuropathy may mask the symptoms. Usually good glycaemic control can be achieved within 6 months, but i f this persists, there is unlikely to be any improvement, where this has been present for 2 years. The main disabling effects for diabetes are due to complications affecting the eyes, large and small blood vessels, and the kidneys. The prognosis will then depend on the complication.

Back to top of section Diabetes in people over 65 Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM) often, but not always presents in older people. The prevalence of diabetes rises with increasing age and affects around 20% of those over 65 years in the UK, up to 50% in some ethnic groups and the obese. Of these, half will be unaware that they have diabetes. There are an increasing number of older insulin -dependent diabetics who were diagnosed when young; some have survived with few or no complications. Many older people with diabetes are reco gnised late for various reasons and diagnosis may be made as an incidental finding when routine screening tests are carried out. This is partly because the renal threshold for glucose is raised (so the classical symptoms of polyuria and glycosuria occur la ter) and the thirst mechanism is reduced (so the symptom of excessive drinking is delayed). The mortality rate for older people with diabetes is more than twice that of non-diabetic people of the same age mainly because of the increase in cardiovascular di sease especially in those with Type 2 Diabetes. Older people, especially those who have had diabetes for more than 20 years have a reduced awareness of the symptoms of hypoglycaemia (if treated with insulin or sulphonurea medication) and therefore are at greater risk. Because of the development of complications with diabetes over time older person with diabetes are more likely to have complications than younger persons: - After 20 years, almost all patients with IDDM have some retinopathy After 20 years, 30% develop nephropathy Around 30% of diabetic patients develop neuropathy; it is related to the duration of the diabetes and the degree of control. Secondary diabetes is more common in older people. Back to top of sectio n What you need to know about Dislocations Back to A - Z What is a Dislocation?

The principles of treatment are the same as for younger people although it may be more difficult for them to obtain appropriate treatment. What are dissociative disorders? Dissociative disorders are disorders where there is a disruption of the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity or perception of the environment. The cause of dissociative disorders is not known but it is thought that they develop as a protection against remembering life -threatening traumatic life events and those threatening to bodily integrity such as abuse, rape, war and natural disasters. There may be a genetic component as there is an increas ed incidence in relatives of people with the condition. What evidence is available? In cases of moderate and severe dissociative disorders it is highly probable that a Consultant Psychiatrist will have been involved in the management and treatment of the individual. Indeed the absence of any documented history of a psychiatric consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis.

People with recurrent and more complex disease attend hospital outpatients including gastroenterology, surgery and ge riatric clinics. Reports may be obtained from doctors and specialist nurses working in these clinics. Specialist stoma nurses can provide up to date information on people with temporary or permanent colostomies. Some people at home recovering from surgery and those with colostomies, receive treatment and advice from community (district) nurses. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility Considerations People with asymptomatic diverticular disease found during investigations for other abdominal conditions have no functional restrictions and pursue normal life styles. Similarly those with intermittent symptoms or episodes of acute diverticulitis that respond readily to standard treatment, are unlikely to have a ny long term functional restrictions necessitating help from others. The abdominal pain experienced is usually intermittent or episodic and does not affect the function of the lower limbs or restrict walking. Most people who undergo surgery for complicati ons can be expected to recover after some weeks or months. Most adults with a temporary or permanent colostomy can be trained to manage it themselves within days or weeks. People with poor manual dexterity, visual impairment, abnormal cognitive function (e.g. dementia) may need colostomy care from another on a long -term basis. Click on the link for details of -: Bowel Incontinence Back to top of section How long will the needs last? People with recurrent symptoms of abdominal pain and changes of bowel habit are usually able to manage their condition with attention to diet and medication. !0 - 25% may develop episodes of acute diverticul itis, and it is not known why this happens in some rather than others. Acute diverticulitis usually responds to treatment with fluids, antibiotics and analgesics within a few days or a week. After an initial attack the yearly risk of having another episod e is 3%. About 50% of recurrences occur within a year and 90% in five years. However people with symptomatic disease and people who experience episodes of acute inflammation are unlikely to have adverse outcomes and can lead a normal life style without und ue restriction. Following surgery for complications most people make a good recovery after some weeks or months. Those who require extensive surgery or more than one operation may take longer to recover fully. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Over 65 Some elderly frail individuals may take longer to recover and need help with dressing , personal hygiene, moving around at home, help with the toilet, long term help with using a colostomy, attention to diet and supervision of medication etc. Elderly people who have had extensive and complex surgery may experience long -term debility.

Read more about award duration. Over 65s The size and function of the liver deteriorates with ageing. In general liver diseases in the elderly carry a worse prognosis than in the younger age. However the clinical features and treatment of the liver impairments are similar in both age groups. What is Drug - induced liver disease? A large number of prescribed drugs, other medicinal substances and toxins can damage the liver. In most cases the hepato -toxic effect is idiosyncratic and cannot be predicted; in certain cases the drug or substance is known to damage the liver and the effect is dose dependent. Toxic effects can be avoided in the latter circumstances by prescribing low doses and withdrawing the drug as soon as problems arise. Herbal remedies and illegal drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy can cause liver damage. Some people appear to be more susceptible to drug hepato -toxicity than others. There may be increased susceptibility with age. It is estimated that between 0.1 and 3% of hospital admissions are due to adverse drug reactions affecting the liver. A small number of drug reactions cause fatal liver disease. If evidence shows that the customer has liver failure, which may have resulted from drug - induced liver disease then go to Liver Failure guidance. If evidence shows that the customer has cirrhosis, which may have resulted from drug - induced liver disease then go to Cirrhosis guid ance. What evidence is available? It is usually the case that people with drug induced liver disease will have been diagnosed and treated in hospital. Reports can be obtained from Consultants or spec ialist nurses working in liver clinics. When an individual has made a good recovery from an episode of drug induced liver damage, it may be most helpful to obtain a general practitioner factual report.

People with stomach ulceration lead normal lives without any long -term functional restrictions on a daily basis. They would not be restricted in their ability to walk or to care for themselves. Adults who have undergone su rgery for stomach ulcer complications would be expected to recover within a few weeks and return to full function with a normal prognosis. How long will the needs last? In most cases symptoms due to stomach ulceration resolve rapidly with drug treatment, within days or weeks. Recurrent dyspepsia or exacerbations of pain usually respond to a further course of tablets. Symptoms can also be controlled on a long -term basis with antacids or courses of protein pump inhibitors. Following hospital admission and/or surgery for complications such as bleeding or perforation a full recovery and return to normal function can be expected. Where drugs such as NSAIDs have been implicated in stomach ulceration, no recurrence is likely if these classes of med ication are avoided in the future. If these drugs are necessary for pain relief, for example in the more severe types of arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis), additional prescription of a protein pump inhibitor (PPI) medication reduces the likelihood of stomac h ulceration and its complications.

Likely difficulties for this group include recurrent symptoms as their botulinum toxin wears off, these are unlikely to be as severe as prior to initial treatment but may cause difficulties driving. For a small number of people who have not responded to botulinum toxin and in whom other treatments have been ineffective there may be disabling effects related to the effect of the condition on vision. There are likely to be difficulties with self care or mobility around the home. Cooking and travelling outside the home are likely to be difficult if vision is significantly i mpaired. Oromandibular dystonia (cranial dystonia) This condition affects speech and ability to eat by making these activities difficult and socially awkward. A minority of people will control their condition with regular botulinum toxin injections. No car e or mobility needs would be anticipated. Likely difficulties for this group include recurrent symptoms as their botulinum toxin wears off; these are unlikely to be as severe as prior to initial treatment. If the condition cannot be controlled by treatment there will be no care or mobility needs. However the nature of the condition may lead to social isolation, depression or other mental health condition. In these cases assessment of needs should be made on the mental health condition. Spasmodic dysphonia o r laryngeal dystonia There are typically no care or mobility needs associated with this condition, although it may have necessitated a change in employment if severe. Although the voice may be very quiet or sound strangled, it is still possible to communic ate. However the nature of the condition may lead to social isolation, depression or other mental health condition. In these cases assessment of needs should be made on the mental health condition. Spasmodic torticollis or cervical dystonia The majority of people will control their condition with regular botulinum toxin injections. No care or mobility needs would be anticipated. Likely difficulties for this group include recurrent symptoms as their botulinum toxin wears off; these are unlikely to be as seve re as prior to initial treatment. People with more disabling symptoms or those that do not respond to botulinum toxin injections are likely to try drug treatment. If this treatment also fails then surgery including selective peripheral denervation and deep brain stimulation may be tried. The nature of the condition may lead to social isolation, depression or other mental health condition. This is more likely if chronic pain is present. In these cases assessment of needs should be made on the mental health condition. In a severe case there may be needs related to physical symptoms. Medical evidence of such disability must be provided. Examples include: Where posture is very contorted and there are spinal complications such as radiculopathies and accelerated Spondylosis. fixed postures (particularly if the head is fixed down onto the chest or fixed in extension (looking up above) the condition cannot be controlled by any treatment Hemifacial spasm The vast majority of people will control their condition wit h regular botulinum toxin injections.

Likely difficulties for this group include recurrent symptoms as their botulinum toxin wears off, these are unlikely to be as seve re as prior to initial treatment but may cause difficulties driving. Spasms may interfere with speech but not prevent it. Recurrent botulinum toxin injections eventually may give rise to wasting of the muscles of the face making it look asymmetrical. The nature of the condition and its effect on appearance may lead to loss of employment, social isolation and depression - the effects of the condition on mental health may give rise to needs. Writer's cramp or hand dystonia This condition has no effect on mob ility. The dystonia may affect activities of self care; for example washing would be unaffected but there may be difficulty doing up buttons and tying laces in a very severe case especially where tremor is also a feature. Similarly the ability to prepare f ood may be compromised if the condition is severe -e.g. holding a knife to chop vegetables. In the majority of cases these activities not directly related to writing will not be or minimally be affected by the dystonia and there will be no care needs. Writ er's cramp can impinge significantly on occupations where writing is a major part of the work load. The exception to this, in a mild condition, will be where self care requires a higher level of manual dexterity than is usual because of other medical problems or disabilities. Examples of this will include any type of stoma including a colostomy, urostomy, laryngectomy stoma etc where small dressings may need to be cut and manipulated into position. The type of activities affected are those which require tw o hands, one used to hold something steady and the other used to perform the activity. Indwelling catheters and attached night drainage bag for example require the use of both hands to screw small connections into place, these actions may be impossible wit h a dystonia of the forearm. Complex medication needs such as the following - indwelling catheters and lines, injections, the use of home nebuliser and oxygen equipment may be affected in a severe case. Generalised dystonias Idiopathic Torsion dystonia Adults with this condition are likely to have developed generalised dystonia during childhood. The condition commonly affects the legs from the beginning and immediately affects walking ability. Abnormal spasmodic movements of the legs make taking steps very exhausting and difficult and remaining balanced with uncontrolled movements is also difficult. Within a few years walking more than half a mile may be impossible and gradually the distance walked independently reduces as spasms become more frequent and se vere. Speed of walking is much reduced from onset. Severe disability is usual within about 10 years. Such people may be able to mobilise short distances and get into a wheelchair but will need a wheelchair when outside the house. Spasms of the upper limb a nd trunk may make self care very difficult if not impossible. For example lifting the arm to brush the hair may always result in abnormal movements and help may be required with washing and personal grooming for this reason. Help with personal care is less likely to be needed in people who have some response to drug treatment. DBS surgery may be considered or used. This surgery may considerably improve movements and improve ability to walk and self care to the level where no help with care or mobility is r equired. DBS takes some time to improve function as adjustments to stimulation to improve function are made over time. Personal adjustment after a period of severe disability also takes time. Rare dystonias Myoclonus dystonia There are typically no care or mobility needs associated with this condition Tardive dystonia In the majority of cases stopping the causative drug will reverse the condition and movement return to normal over several months. If the condition has been present for more than a yea r it is unlikely to dramatically improve. The disabling effects will depend on which part or parts of the body are affected and how effective treatment is at controlling or reducing the movements. For facial tics affecting the eyes and mouth only see bleph arospasm and Oromandibular dystonia. In a severe case the trunk neck, arm and leg muscles are affected and the condition is more like a generalised dystonia, it may affect walking, balance or use of the upper limbs for self care or other activities. The co ndition is highly visible to others, the nature of the condition and its effect on appearance may lead to loss of employment, social isolation and depression - the effects of the condition on mental health may give rise to needs. If there is concurrent men tal illnesses please refer to mental health guidance. Tardive dyskinesia The most effective treatment is to stop the causative drug as soon as possible. Symptoms will often disappear if this is done quickly enough. Abnormal movements may be present 24 ho urs a day, with constant jerking twitching and grimacing movements of the face in addition to fidgeting of the hands and upper limbs. The movements may disturb sleep. Communication is affected because the abnormal movements interfere with facial expression . The condition is highly visible to others, the nature of the condition and its effect on appearance may lead to loss of employment, social isolation and depression - the effects of the condition on mental health may give rise to needs. If there is concur rent mental illnesses please refer to mental health guidance. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Focal dystonias Blepharospasm This condition is likely to stabilise after a few years and neither improve or get worse. Regular treatment will be required to preserve useful vision. If treatment fails at any point then needs are likely to arise in a severe case. Oromandibular dystonia (cranial dystonia) This condition is likely to stabilise after a few years and no t improve or get worse. In a minority of cases it will be reasonably controlled with regular treatment. If uncontrolled, needs may arise from the effect of the condition on mental health. Spasmodic dysphonia or laryngeal dystonia Even when severe there are no care or mobility needs associated with this condition. Needs may arise from the effect of the condition on mental health. Spasmodic torticollis or cervical dystonia This condition is likely to get worse over several years and stabilise. Those cases with significant pain that are uncontrolled by treatment are most likely to have needs and these needs are likely to persist. Those with milder symptoms who are of young age and are not likely to have needs are most likely to recover from the conditi on, although permanent remission is rare. Hemifacial spasm This dystonia behaves like other dystonias, it get worse over several years and then becomes stable. In most cases it can be controlled with regular botulinum toxin injections and rarely curative s urgery is used. Without surgery ongoing treatment is needed to control symptoms. The condition does not tend to go away by itself. Writer's cramp or hand dystonia This condition tends to persist, particularly if severe. If needs are identified either beca use a person has personal care needs requiring manual dexterity or because the condition is exceptionally severe these are likely to be enduring. The next sections cover other types of dystonia, which are less common but which can be very disabling. Gene ralised dystonias Idiopathic (primary) generalised Torsion dystonia This condition is enduring and is unlikely to respond well enough to drugs for walking to be resumed. There may be needs associated with mental health problems related to having a severe physical disability in addition to any physical needs identified. Significant change in level of disability is unlikely unless Deep Brain Stimulation surgery is undertaken. It may take a long time after such surgery for maximal reduction in disability to b e achieved. If DBS is used disability is likely to be reduced in most cases and dramatically so in many with resumption of normal walking ability and the ability to use the upper limbs normally with minimal or mild Dystonic movements. A stable condition is likely to be reached around 2 years after surgery. Dopa -responsive dystonia -parkinsonism (Segawa's Syndrome) The partial condition responds very well to drug treatment with levodopa. In the typical case there is likely to be severe disability prior to diagnosis that resolves with diagnosis and treatment. Long term effective treatment with none of the expected side effects associated with levodopa is anticipated. The homozygous type severe case is likely to be and remain severely disabled with mental re tardation, seizures and enduring physical and mental impairment related to severe developmental delay. Rare dystonias Myoclonus dystonia This condition stabilises after a few years. Other dystonia conditions may develop later in life in addition to Myoclo nus. Tardive dystonia This condition usually resolves when the causative drug is stopped. If not stopped the condition gets progressively worse and may be permanent. The condition is unlikely to improve very much once present for a year. Tardive dyskines ia This condition usually resolves when the causative drug is stopped. If not stopped the condition gets progressively worse and may be permanent. The condition is unlikely to improve very much once present for a year. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

Read more about effects in the over 65 age group. What evidence is available? Self-assessment is the prime source of evidence, but the claim pack should be checked to see who has completed it. If the form has been filled in by the customer, due to the nature of their condition, it might not necessarily be an accurate or reliable description of their problems. If the claim pack has been completed on behalf of the customer, by someone who has a good understanding of his or her needs, then it could provide good evidence. The DM should bear in mind that the completion of th e corroborative statement by a mental health professional does not necessarily mean that they endorse what has been said in the claim pack. In all cases of moderate and severe eating disorders it is highly probable that a Consultant Psychiatrist will have been involved in the management and treatment of the individual. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if required. Although the absence of any documented history of a psychiatric co nsultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis, please note that people with eating disorders usually deny problems and may avoid medical contact, especially psychiatric care. Therefore a HCP E xamination report should be considered for a person with a moderate or severe eating disorder with no recent documented evidence (GP or hospital) of risk factors. An HCP Examination report may be helpful if t he person has physical problems Other sources of information include the following: Community Mental Health Team The community mental health team provides a multidisciplinary team approach. The team will include psychiatrists, community psychiatric nurses, occupational therapists and social workers w orking in close collaboration with social service departments. One member of the team may co -ordinate the care and is known as the Care Co -ordinator. Care co -ordinator When the customer is being supported by a community mental health team the care co -ordinator on that team will be the preferred source of further evidence. They have lead responsibility for the delivery of the care plan and so they can give details of the support that the customer has been assessed as needing. They will also know whether t he customer is being helped by an Assertive Outreach or Crisis Resolution team. Day Centre and Psychiatric Day Hospital Attendance at a day centre (not on hospital site) or psychiatric day hospital (on hospital site) is likely to indicate severe disability . These are therapeutic environments for evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of patients with mental health problems. They are staffed by psychiatric nurses, and there is input from all other members of the community mental health team. Attendance presents an alternative for patients whose condition requires intensive treatment, but do not need to be hospitalised. Community Psychiatric Nurse (CPN) A customer may be in regular contact with a CPN who will have assessed their care requirements. Advice is given about the amount of psychiatric nursing required and the administration of drugs. The CPN will be in contact with other mental health professionals. They are well placed to provide detailed evidence about the customer's needs. NHS Care Programme Approach (CPA) care plan When the customer is in contact with mental health services there will be a care plan under the NHS Care Programme Approach. The care plan will include inform ation on health and social care as well as domestic support and is reviewed regularly. The customer is given their own copy, which could be requested, as it will contain useful evidence of needs. Social Services care plan Social Services departments may b e approached for help by someone with mental health problems. A community care assessment by a social worker/care manager will be arranged and a care plan produced. The care plan will include details of the customer's day -to-day living and the support provided. A copy can be obtained from the customer. Mental Health Social Worker Where a mental health social worker has been appointed to support a customer they will have information about the cust omer's ability to cope with everyday living. Subject to consent to approach them being given, the mental health social worker will be able to provide some useful evidence about the customer's needs. Accommodation manager When the customer is living in supported accommodation then the type and level of support provided could be helpful in determining their need for help. A phone call to the accommodation manager could provide useful evidence. Crisis Resolution Team The customer may have been supported d uring a crisis by the Crisis Resolution Team. The teams are mainly comprised of CPNs, who would make urgent visits, day or night to anyone who is thought to be in need of hospitalisation. The idea is to provide intensive treatment at home instead. The Cri sis Resolution Team would be well placed to provide details of the customer's condition. General practitioner factual report If there is no specialist mental health professional involvement or evidence cannot be obtained from them, then it may be necessary to request a factual report from the customer's own doctor. The GP may have only limited knowledge of customer's mental health problems, even when there is no one else involved. Back to top of sectio n Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Function is usually well preserved in people with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and Bulimia Nervosa (BN). If the disorders are mixed e.g. AN and BN, the symptoms tend to be worse. If there is co -morbidity with dia betes medical risks are exponentially increased. Functioning may be very impaired in the presence of severe obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms and may potentially make a mild or moderate condition more severe. Females who are pregnant or care f or infants may need extra assistance. Driving is not recommended for people with a BMI <15 as concentration and attention may be impaired. In AN most people are physically capable of feeding themselves, but they may require prompting to do so. If the per son's weight loss becomes extreme and they become severely ill, they require intensive attention to feeding and maintaining normal body chemistry. Such people will usually be admitted to hospital. People with AN, unless weight loss is extreme, would not normally be expected to have any mobility needs. In BN because weight loss is usually absent, care needs are likely to be significantly less than for AN Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Effects People with a mild functional restriction are likely to: Not be receiving psychiatric care or supervision Be at low physical risk Mobility They would normally have no physical difficulty in getting around. They should not have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and should not require guidance. ADL They should not normally exhibit significant self -neglect. They should not normally have any significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day -to-day activities. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Effects People with a moderate functional restriction are likely to: Be at moderate physical risk Mobility They would normally have no difficulty walking several hundred metres. They should not have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and should not require guidance. ADL They may require encouragement to eat and plan and prepare a meal. They should not normally have any significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day -to-day activities. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Effects People with a severe functional restriction: Are likely to be at severe physical risk May have severe OCD symptoms or co -morbid medical conditions, for example, diabetes May be at high risk of self harm Mobility Walking distance may be severely restricted due to muscular weakness secondary to dehydration and salt imbalance. Salt imbalance may also cause muscl e spasms, fits and faints. Renal failure may occur in severe cases. The distance that they are able to walk will be determined by the degree of muscular weakness which will vary from person to person. They should not have difficulty finding their way ar ound unfamiliar places and should not require guidance. ADL They are likely to require encouragement to eat and plan and prepare a meal. They are likely to have a significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day -to-day activities. They are likely to require observation to stop compensatory behaviours, for example exercise or vomiting. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Anorexia Nervosa (AN) About half of people with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) recover completely, a quarter improve and a quarter develop a chronic eating disorder. Mortality has been reported as up to 5% over 4 to 5 years, but as high as 10% in the long term. Just over two third of deaths are due to the effects of starvation and one third are by suicide. Education is disrupted, with attendance at school reduced by more than 50%. Vocational functioning is also impaired, with 21% of people still relying on state benefits 10 -15 years after the onse t of the illness. Social isolation is common, social communication skills are poor and social networks are small. Good prognosis is associated with an early age at onset and a short interval between the onset of symptoms and the beginning of treatment. Poor prognosis is associated with vomiting, bulimia, profound weight loss, long duration of illness, co -morbid psychiatric illness and psychosocial problems. Bulimia Nervosa (BN) About 50% of people with Bulimia Nervosa make a full recovery, 30% make a part ial recovery and 20% continue to be symptomatic. Good prognosis is associated with a shorter duration of illness, younger age of onset and higher socio -economic status. Poor prognosis is associated with borderline personality disorder, concurrent substanc e misuse, low motivation for change and a history of obesity. An increase in mortality rate has been reported for Bulimia Nervosa (9 times the normal population risk). In view of the potential for improvement, if the condition has been present for less than 5 years, a 2 year award should be considered. If the condition has been present for more than 5 years, a 5 year award should be considered. EDNOS (Eating disorder not otherwise specified) The course and prognosis of EDNOS is similar to that of the disorder it most closely resembles i.e. AN or BN. In view of the potential for improvement, if the condition has been present for less than 5 years, a 2 year award should be considered. If the condition has been present for more than 5 years, a 5 year awa rd should be considered. In view of the potential for improvement in each type of eating disorder suggested award duration is -: Impairment Date of Onset Award duration Anorexia nervosa Less than 5 years More than 5 years 2 year award 5 year award Bulimia nervosa Less than 5 years More than 5 years 2 year award 5 year award Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) Less than 5 years More than 5 years 2 year award 5 year award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Over 65 Eating disorders are uncommon in the elderly, although rare cases have been reported in people over the age of 65. Although the clinical features and treatment are similar to those in people under 65, because the condition is uncommon in the elderly, diagnosis may be delayed.

In rare cases of resistant eczema, particularly those where there is long standing damage to the skin from friction or scratching, healing does not occur and longer term difficulty with manual dexterity may be evident. These patients are usually under specia list care and evidence of persistent functional disability needs to be sought and each case considered in on its own merits. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Eczema is usually a mild intermittent condition with minimal function effects for the majority of the time. During flare -up of eczema the patient experiences discomfort and irritation that may interfere with sleep. Eczema of the hands, particularly when there is significant fissuring or cracking of the skin, may cause temporary impairment of manual dexterity with difficulty doing up buttons or using implements. Eczema affecting the feet may make standing and walking uncomfortable for a short period until the rash subsides. Creams or ointments may need to be applied to areas that the patie nt is unable to reach and help may be needed with this. However in most cases the attack would be expected to last no more than 3 -4 weeks at this level of severity and in the recovery phase, although there may be residual skin rash, there should be no loss of ability to deal with personal functions or the ability to walk. In rare cases of resistant eczema, particularly those where there is long standing damage to the skin from friction or scratching, healing does not occur and longer term difficulty with ma nual dexterity may be evident. These patients are usually under specialist care and evidence of persistent functional disability needs to be sought and each case considered in on its own merits. Variability Eczema usually follows a pattern of exacerbation (flare -up) and remission (recovery) with periods between attacks when the skin is apparently normal. Attacks can last for several weeks at a time often with several months between. Repeated contact with irritants or sensitizers may induce exacerbations and the patient would be expected to be able to take action to avoid contact with known precipitating factors. In some cases, particularly in atopic eczema, there may be a chronic low grade rash although this rarely would be expected to cause functional disability. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? For those whose atopic eczema persists into adulthood, the condition is likely to be permanent. Likewise allergic skin sensitisation is likely to persist for life. Irritant eczema should resolve and the skin should heal permanently once the source of irritation has been removed and the acute condition treated. In some cases where irritation has been prolonged or the condition neglected the inflammation of t he skin can become chronic with continuous symptoms needing ongoing treatment. However, in most cases exacerbations would be expected to last no more than 3 -4 weeks and although there may be residual skin rash, there should be no loss of ability to deal w ith personal functions or the ability to walk. With good management and reasonable care to avoid precipitating factors, most cases of eczema should be controlled with minimal resulting disability. All information must be taken into account when consideri ng the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

Hospice Hospice Specialists -: Palliative Care Physician Macmillan Nurse Clinical Nurse Specialist Social worker Physiotherapist Occupational Therapist Counsellor Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs The majority of women will receive curative treatment for early stage disease and return to health with no disabling effects. Some may develop long term side effects of treatment. Stage 1 and 2 disease Long term side effects of treatment are infertility and early menopause. There are unlikely to be any long term care and mobility needs after treatment. The exception to this is the enduring but rare side effects of chemotherapy, pelvic lymphadenectomy (removal of the lymph nodes around the uterus) or radiotherapy. Needs are likely to arise when disease recurs. Stage 3 disease Long term disabling effects include the rare enduring side effects of chemotherapy. Side effects of radiotherapy may develop some years after treatment. Recurrent disease is fairly common and may occur only a few months after treatment of init ial disease - up to date medical evidence from the treating hospital will be important. Stage 4 disease Most of these people are terminally ill. Those that are fit enough to have surgery are likely to go on to have chemotherapy or radiotherapy and are those with the best outcome in this group. A proportion may have many of the problems of metastatic disease group at the outset. Problems specific to endometrial cancer include -: Lymphoedema of the lower limbs. Pelvic pain syndromes. Problems with the bowel o r bladder following radiotherapy treatment, these may affect continence of either and occasionally the formation of a stoma such as a colostomy or ileostomy if the lower bowel or rectum is affected by the cancer may be necessary. Metastatic and recurrent d isease There may be disabling effects from metastatic disease anywhere in the body including -: Liver metastases - these may cause fatigue and in the later stages, mental confusion, abdominal swelling or pain and jaundice. Lung metastases or malignant pl eural effusion - may cause very disabling breathlessness reducing mobility to a few yards. Brain metastases - these may cause fits, personality change, confusion, difficulties with balance, walking and self care. Bone metastases - pain and pathological fra ctures. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? In the rare situation where care and mobility needs are identified because of treatment of stage 1, 2 or 3 endometrial cancer, any award made should last for the durat ion of treatment as typically improvement is expected. In stage 4 and recurrent disease needs are likely to increase over time. Stage 1 and 2 disease Five year survival from stage 1 disease is about 95%. Five year survival from stage 2 disease is 80 -90%. Stage 3 disease Five year survival from stage 3 disease is 50 -60%. Stage 4 disease Five year survival for stage 4 disease is about 26%. Most of these people are terminally ill. Metastatic and Recurrent disease This person is likely to be terminally ill although the expected survival may be longer than six months. The majority of women have early stage disease but some of these women will experience recurrence of their endometrial cancer. After treatment endometrial cancer may recur eithe r as a growth in the pelvis or more usually somewhere else in the body. For those with locally advanced disease like stage 4 disease, recurrence is very likely even when primary treatment is successful. The aim of treatment in stage 4 disease is to contro l the disease for as long as possible. Cancer stage Award Period Stages 1, 2 or 3 Period of treatment plus reasonable recovery period Stage 4, Metastatic and Recurrent disease Indefinite award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

However, if further details are needed, the General Practitioner or Consultant is an appropriate source of information. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs In general, only the most severely affected people with epilepsy will qualify for an award, (i.e. those with either frequent or severe fits causing injury, those who have no warning or have a dangerous and prolonged post - ictal phase). Epilepsy affects each person in a differ ent way. In some cases, supervision or attention may be required to prevent the risk of harm and injury during a seizure. To determine this risk, the following questions should be asked to build a complete picture of the customer's epileptic condition and the way that condition affects their lifestyle. Once this information is known, DLA / AA legislation can then be applied to the customer's circumstances. Note: None of the following questions on their own provide all the information needed to assess th e risk of harm and the need for supervision / attention. Question Reason 1. What is the frequency of seizures? This begins to provide part of the overall picture. 2. What type of seizure / seizures are experienced? This is important as some types of seizure produce very specific seizure characteristics. Some people experience more than one type of seizure. This will help with the consideration of risk. 3. Is a useful warning of a seizure experienced and if so is it recognised and remembered? This inf ormation helps to consider the need for any supervision or attention in connection with the seizure. 4. What is the history and nature of any injuries sustained during the seizure? Again, this assists in determining the level of risk and deciding what supervision / attention is needed to avoid or reduce that risk. Injuries sustained may be bruising or tongue biting to fractures or head injury. 5. What is the nature and duration of any automatic / post - epileptic behaviour? Again, this will help to determ ine the level of risk and the supervision / attention needed to avoid or reduce that risk. Post - epileptic behaviour can last from a few minutes to days. Similar considerations are made by Occupational Health physicians in relation to employment and by th e DVLA regarding safety to drive as detailed in the link below. Other considerations might be -: Does the customer drive? Are seizures experienced during the day and / or night? Is the parent caring for a young child under the age of three? Has the customer had an episode of unexplained 'Status Epilepticus' in the past 12 months? The above information will help with the consideration of entitlement and / or duration of award. Click on the link for details of -: Living with Epilepsy Nocturnal seizures Back to top of section How long will the needs last? In looking at prognosis and duration of disabling effects, it is helpful to divide seizures into idiopathic (seizures without any known cause) and secondary (where there is an underlying cause). The success in preventing seizures with Anti -Epileptic Drugs (AEDs) varies depending upon the type of seizure . With idiopathic seizures, there is a good chance that AEDs will control the condition. However, seizures caused by underlying brain disease may be more difficult to control. Suggested factors for the development of chronic, poorly controlled epilepsy in clude: Presence of additional disabling conditions Partial epilepsy More than one seizure type Long duration of active seizures Frequent seizures at onset Type Date of Onset Award Period Generalised seizure (with status epilepticus in last 12 months) -: Absence seizure (Petit mal) Atonic seizure Clonic seizure Myoclonic seizure Tonic seizure Tonic -clonic seizure (Grand mal) primary or secondary Episode within the last year 1 year award Partial seizure (with status epilepticus in last 12 months - : Complex partial seizure Complex partial seizure evolving to generalised tonic - clonic seizure Simple partial seizure Episode within the last year 1 year award Generalised seizure (without status epilepticus in last 12 months) -: Absence seizure (Petit mal) Atonic seizure Clonic seizure Myoclonic seizure Tonic seizure Tonic -clonic seizure (Grand mal) primary or secondary Less than 2 years More than 2 years 2 year award 5 year award Partial seizure (without status epilepticus in last 12 months) -: Complex partial seizure Complex partial seizure evolving to generalised tonic - clonic seizure Simple partial seizure Less than 2 years More than 2 years 2 year award 5 year award Non epileptic attack disorder (pseudoseizure) N/A N/A Seizure (Epilepsy) - unclassified Less than 2 years More than 2 years 2 year award 5 year award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects, and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant Click on the links for details of -: Living with Epilepsy Nocturnal seizures Back to top of section Seizure disorders in people over 65 The annual incidence of seizure disorders (epilepsy) in those over 60 years is rising, and 25% of new cases of epilepsy occur over the age of 65. The cause of epilepsy can be identified in more than 50% of older patients. The incidence of secondary epilepsy in the elderly has now risen to more than 100 per 100,000, and the main causes of secondary epilepsy are: cerebro -vascular disease (around 50% of cases), brain tumour, injury and bleeding on the brain (sub -dural haematoma), and degenerative conditions of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's Disease. Strokes are more likely to occur in older peopl e, and in the first year following a stroke, 5% have seizures. Because of the common factor of cerebro -vascular disease in this older age group, 3% of stroke patients also have a history of fits. Older people have a lower threshold for developing seizures in response to a stimulus than younger people, and there is an increased likelihood of relapse. As well as differing in causation, incidence and prevalence from those of young adults or children, seizures in the elderly differ in presentation, and predom inant types of fit. It is harder to differentiate for instance between a faint (syncope) and a fit in the elderly; and complex partial status epilepticus may present as confusion. Older people are more at risk of losing their quality of life and independe nce with epilepsy, and are more susceptible to injury and broken limbs because of their increased general frailty, osteoporosis, and relative immobility, for example. All anti -epileptic medications have side effects, and, with an older person, several fac tors are particularly important, including his/ her state of health, the presence of other conditions, (such as heart failure) and other medication which the patient is taking. However, it is possible to control 70% of fits in the older age group. Many el derly people are still driving, and the same driving regulations apply. Back to top of section Living with Epilepsy Introduction Behaviour and emotions Driving and recreation Education and employment Pregnancy and motherhood Daily living Caring for a child under 3 years of age Introduction The vast majority of people with epilepsy are able to live full lives with no disability in between attacks. Approximately 80% can be significantly helped by current therapies and may go months or years between seizures with 70% being seizure free on Anti -Epileptic Drugs (AEDs). However, there is a 2 to 3 fold increase in sudden death, which is unexplained and unpredictable. With some types of seizures, there is a risk of head injury o r aspiration of vomit into the lungs, which can, on occasions be fatal. Epilepsy can and does affect a small proportion of people and their friends and families by influencing other factors, which may seriously impact on their activities of daily life. Fo r example, some people may require someone else there all the time because they experience fits without any warning and/or exhibit dangerous post -epileptic behaviour. People with prolonged seizures or severe seizures that are resistant to treatment have, on average, a shorter life expectancy and an increased risk of cognitive impairment. This is particularly the case if the seizures developed early in childhood. Behaviour and emotions It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy to develop b ehavioural and emotional difficulties. Such individuals may avoid social contact in school, employment, or other settings. All people with epilepsy have an increased risk of poor self -esteem, depression and suicide, and may live with an ever -present fear that they will have another seizure. Driving and recreation By law, people with epilepsy must stop driving and notify the DVLA (Drivers and Vehicle Licensing Agency). In the U.K. a Group 1 (car or motorcycle) licence cannot be held unless the following le gal criteria are met. The regulations state: A person who has suffered an epileptic attack whilst awake must refrain from driving for 1 year from the date of the attack before a driving licence may be issued. A person who has suffered a single epileptic attack whilst asleep must also refrain from driving for 1 year from the date of the attack. If seizures have occurred only during sleep for a period of at least 3 years, and no attacks whilst awake have occurred, then a Group 1 driving licence may be held. The DVLA advises patients not to drive during a period of drug withdrawal, and for 6/12 after the withdrawal has been completed. In any event, the driving of a vehicle by such a person should not be likely to cause danger to the public. For vocation al and truck drivers the regulations are even stricter, (i.e. a 10 year period of freedom must be established during which there is no anticonvulsant use). Stringent regulations also apply to the armed forces, aircraft pilots, sea captains, divers and sim ilar activities. The correct diagnosis of a seizure or other attack at any age is therefore of major social and legal importance. In the UK it is the responsibility of the affected individual to inform the DVLA. If treatment (AEDs) is withdrawn, the DVL A recommends that driving should cease whilst the AEDs are being withdrawn, and for a period of 6 months following withdrawal. If the person has a seizure, then the normal regulations apply. In law if within a 24hour period, more than one epileptic attac k occurs, these are treated as a \"single event\" for the purpose of applying the epilepsy regulations for driving. An episode of Status Epilepticus would be considered, as a solitary seizure and the driving licence would be withdrawn for 1 year. Education and employment Most children with epilepsy attend mainstream schools. Many children with epilepsy have no other major condition, and the seizures are well controlled. Some children with epilepsy have other major conditions (such as learning difficulties) and may require special schooling. This accounts for up to 25% of children with epilepsy. Pregnancy and motherhood Women with epilepsy need special treatment, and active advice with regard to contraception and becoming pregnant. Some of the AE Ds used to treat epilepsy are associated with birth defects. This risk is slightly higher than 4 - 6% compared with the background risk of 1-3%. Many patients with epilepsy, who become pregnant, stop their medication because of the potential side effects of the medication on the unborn baby. This may increase the seizure frequency. Pregnancy often makes epilepsy worse, because there are complex biochemical changes in the body, in pregnancy, which may increase seizure frequency, or change the effectivenes s of the medication. Epilepsy may present for the first time in pregnancy. Daily living A number of factors are likely to influence the effects of epilepsy on daily living and therefore any care or mobility needs. No single factor can be decisive. The v ast majority of people with epilepsy are able to live full lives with little disability in between attacks. They cannot generally be considered as being in substantial danger. Though the medications which they take may not affect the majority of people's ability to care for themselves and get around, they may be affected to some degree by side effects, such as mental sluggishness, depression, tremors, rashes, spots, hypertrophy of the gums, blood disorders to name a few. A risk of seizure occurrence does not in itself mean that a person needs attention or supervision. In some types of seizures, the person may be incontinent during the seizure. However, unless other conditions are present e.g. learning difficulties or problems with manual dexterity, the pe rson will usually be able to deal with this themselves. It is a small minority who will require attention or supervision to any significant degree due to complicating conditions or where the epilepsy cannot be adequately controlled. Caring for a child und er 3 years of age A parent with epilepsy who is caring for a young child may pose a risk to that child. When assessing that risk, the following should be taken into account: - The nature of the fits Whether there is any useful warning of an impending fit Any dangerous post fit behaviour The frequency of the fits Age of the child If it is considered there is a significant risk the person with epilepsy may need supervision to prevent them injuring the child during a seizure. Back to top of section Nocturnal (night -time) seizures Some seizures occur at night, and for some people seizures occur only at night. Once a person is in bed, they are not at risk of falling and injuring themselves. The danger of choking or being suffocated by a pillow is extremely small and special pillows are available on the market to reduce this possibility to a minimum. Alternatively, the person may choose not to use a pillow. There are also other adaptations which could be made to the room, such as the use of a low bed. With some types of epilepsy, confused or automatic behaviour may lead to the danger of wandering or other behaviour, which may lead to harm to the person. In these circumstances, it would be sensible for ap propriate precautions to be taken, such as having another person in the house and minimizing hazards. It should be sufficient that someone is present in the house with the person, as there would not usually be a need for another person to remain awake ob serving the person in case they had a fit.

Linking -: Ageing Falls Frailty Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Fainting, by definition, results in a transient period of unconsciousness and therefore carries a degree of risk of injury from falling o r the effects of losing consciousness while in a potentially hazardous situation such as when driving or working at height. However, a simple faint is usually an isolated episode and should not result in the need for restriction of activities or any specif ic help or supervision out with that needed at the time of the attack. Simple faints can occur repeatedly in susceptible individuals, usually in predictable situations and even so should not result in a functional abnormality. Solitary episodes of fainting with no evidence of an underlying cause would not result in restriction of driving. Where attacks are frequently recurrent as in situational fainting, or where they are associated with significant underlying disease, the risks of harm and the need for help or supervision will need to be considered based on the more general guidelines for assessing episodic loss of consciousness. Continued frequent attacks of fainting may well impact on quality of life and perceptions of well -being. In a study of a large series of cases the incidence of serious injury such as fracture was 6% and that of minor injury such as abrasion or bruising was 29%. Fainting poses an accepted risk for frail elderly people due to age related physiological changes in heart rate, blood p ressure and cerebral blood flow, as well as the effects of co -existing conditions and is commonly associated with falls. The incidence of fainting is 6% in the older adult (>70 yrs) with a prevalence of 10%, although these figures may underestimate the ris k as incidents of falling may not be reported as fainting. Where there is underlying disease the functional effects of that condition would need to be evaluated in their own right. Variability The condition is episodic and therefore inherently variable. In simple fainting there should be no impairment of function between episodes and any difficulties are limited to the immediate period of the episode. When fainting accompanies an existing condition the ongoing effects of that condition will influence any va riability. How long will the needs last? In young persons with no evidence of underlying cardiac disease and no known cause for the syncope the prognosis is good. Many people experience only a solitary episode although around 30% may experience a further e pisode within 2 years. Some may get attacks in predictable situations such as during periods of anxiety or when unwell with a viral infection but generally the condition is infrequent and unpredictable. The prognosis of syncope resulting from another cond ition depends on the treatment and underlying prognosis of that condition. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

However, where there are complications (see ADL and Mobility needs), then it may be necessary to request a factual report from the customer's own General Practitioner . Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs The immediate e ffects of a fractured bone may cause significant functional restrictions. In many cases, such restrictions are unlikely to persist beyond three months. This period allows for the majority of fractures to heal (unite) and for general physical recovery to ta ke place. In a minority of cases, the fractured bones do not knit together (non -union) and recovery of function may be delayed. Surgery may be required to assist the healing process. Some fractures are complicated by infection. Established bony infection (osteomyelitis) may be very difficult to treat and result in longstanding disability. Such individuals may also be generally unwell. Delayed healing may also occur where the fractured bone has a single blood supply, such as the lower third of the tibia, an d the neck of femur. In some cases a fracture may occur through a joint, damaging the joint structure. If possible, such fractures should be treated by operation. Secondary osteoarthritis often complicates a fracture through a joint, and full recovery of function may not occur. In such cases, care and/or mobility needs may occur. Osteoporosis From middle age onwards, bones gradually become less dense and are more liable to fracture. This is a normal part of the ageing process. Osteoporosis is a condition where this process of bone thinning is greatly accelerated. Osteoporotic bones are brittle and are much more likely to fracture. The healing of osteoporotic fractures is not impaired, so any resultant disability may not last more than a few weeks or month s. This is often the case in the younger person. However in the elderly, who have sustained repeated fractures and progressive collapse of the spine, no significant improvement in disability is likely. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? The repair of a fracture is a continuous and gradual process. The amount of time taken for a fracture to unite depends upon the type of fracture and which bones are affected. However, as a general rule, fractures need to be immo bilised for between two to eight weeks. Following this, gentle exercises and movements are important, to build up bone and muscle strength. Physiotherapy may be required to assist this process. As a general rule, a return to about full function within 3 mo nths usually occurs. The healing of osteoporotic fractures is not impaired, so any resultant disability may not last more than a few weeks or months. This is often the case in the younger person. However in the elderly, who have sustained repeated fractur es and progressive collapse of the spine, no significant improvement in disability is likely. If a fracture has occurred, and this is the reason for the functional restrictions, the fracture should heal within 6 months.

Linked pages -: Ageing Falls Frailty Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Most people with gallstones have no symptoms and therefore no functional disability ('silent gallstones'). Some may experience minor symptoms of indigestion, particularly following a meal with a high content of fat. Problems can occur when either the gallbladder becomes inflamed or infected (cholecystitis) or when a stone or part of a stone is dislodged and passes into the bile ducts. These cause acute symptoms relating to systemic effects of infection, biliary colic or obstruction and need urgent treatment. Following treatment of acute symptoms recovery would be expected to be good with no residual disability. Occasionally people may experience recurrent attack s of biliary colic if definitive treatment to remove the stones has not been completed. Between attacks, apart from the possible need to make minor adjustments to diet for the majority of the time, the person should be able to live a normal life. In acute cholecystitis the patient is acutely ill until the condition resolves either spontaneously or with treatment. The attack may be short -lived with spontaneous recovery in 2 -3 days. If it does not recover spontaneously or the condition rapidly deteriorates th e patient will probably need to be admitted to hospital. Episodes may occur infrequently and between attacks the person would be normal with no ongoing disability apart from perhaps the need for some dietary adjustment. Some patients may experience only a single episode with no further problems. In chronic cholecystitis symptoms can recur regularly but there would again be no ongoing loss of function between episodes other than possibly some vague abdominal pain associated with meals. How long will the need s last? Gallstones do not resolve spontaneously and once formed will persist throughout the rest of life. If treated by medication or lithotripsy, there is subsequent a risk of further stone formation. When treated by removal of the gallbladder the proble m should be resolved although in susceptible individuals there remains a small risk of further stones forming within in the bile ducts themselves. Chronic cholecystitis tends to run a prolonged course until treated definitively. Apart from some of the mor e vague symptoms, which cause only mild effect on lifestyle, it is the frequency and severity of episodes of acute cholecystitis that determines the need for specific treatment. The after effects of laparoscopic cholecystectomy are minimal with the person able to resume a normal life within a few weeks. Recovery from open cholecystectomy takes longer with at least six weeks for primary wound healing and up to three months to regain full function of the abdominal muscles. Symptoms are generally episodic in nature and variability relates only to the frequency of acute episodes. Most only last a few days and the patient should not suffer continuing disability between episodes. If these recur regularly then definitive treatment to resolve the problem is indicat ed. Complications following surgery or secondary effects of gallbladder disease on function of the liver or pancreas may prolong the illness but where there is evidence of such problems then each case would need to be considered on its own merits. All inf ormation must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

Note: If considering entitlement to H/R Mobility component under the Severely Visually Impaired (SVI) provisions, the following evidence source must be used: The Consultant Ophthalmologist will be able to provide information about symptoms, signs, investigations including assessment of vi sion, treatment/management, and is likely to have information about resulting disability or needs. Note: If the Consultant Ophthalmologist doesn't have up to date information, consider arranging for an eyecare examination. In the first instance the claimant and/or the carer should be able to provide the information required, but if further information is required an Audiologist or General Practitioner may be an appropriate source. However, a general practitioner does not usually have significant or specialist knowledge of the claimant's hearing loss and resulting needs. A more appropriate source may be a Social Worker (especially one who specialises in working with deaf and hard of hearing people), a Hearing Therapist, a Teacher of the Deaf, or Professionals involved in arranging or delivering c ommunication support to the claimant (such as a Disability Adviser at a college or university, or a BSL interpreter that the client uses regularly). In certain circumstances (e.g. deaf / blind cases), it may be appropriate for the Decision Maker to reques t an Audiological report (a technical assessment) to establish the extent of deafness in a customer. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Although the following is based upon audiometric result s, it should be noted that for an individual, the amount of hearing disability in everyday life cannot be accurately predicted from audiometric test results. The tabulated results are only broadly true for the subgroup as a whole. Even where hearing func tion itself is concerned, the pure tone audiogram measures only one of several aspects. It shows the sensitivity of the ear at different frequencies but does not show reduced discrimination between frequencies, for example. This is another common aspect of sensorineural hearing loss and further affects the ability to follow what people are saying. Interpretation of an audiogram is complex, for example the audiogram does not measure hearing but hearing loss, the hearing loss is on a logarithmic scale so a 20db loss is not half a 40db loss. The DM really needs to consider communication difficulty in addition to straight hearing loss. For example a person will also use visual signs such as lip movements to understand another person. Therefore all information must be taken into account when considering a claim. Mild Functional Restriction - Hearing loss 21 - 40 dB but see disabling effects below Category Description Disabling Effects Within this range a hearing aid may be required depending upon the frequencies affected by the hearing loss, the persons' occupation and whether they have a dual sensory disability. They will be unlikely to require communication aids, to lip read or use manual communication (BSL). They will have speech that can be underst ood by strangers and will be able to hear and understand a normal voice at I metre. Background noise may be intrusive. Mobility The ability to walk is likely to be unimpeded. They are unlikely to have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and are likely to be able to ask for and hear directions. They are likely to be aware of common hazards. ADL The resulting disability is unlikely to affect their ability to independently carry out activities of daily living. They are likely to be able t o identify common hazards in the home. Moderate Functional Restriction - Hearing loss 41 - 70 dB but see disabling effects below Category Description Disabling Effects They are likely to gain benefit from amplification either from a hearing aid or by external devices. They may rely on a combination of amplified sound and lipreading. They will have speech that can be understood by strangers and will be able to hear and understand a normal voice at I metre with appropriate amplification. Background noise will have a notable affect in understanding speech. Mobility The ability to walk is likely to be unimpeded. They are unlikely to have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and are unlikely to require guidance. However, they may not be able to hear traffic and other hazards adequately, for example to enable them to be aware of a hazard approaching outside their field of vision. They may also have difficulty with judging the direction, distance, or velocity of the source of the sound. However, in the absence of other factors such as a learning disability, significant visual problem or mental health problems, this may be compensated for by increased visual awareness and by taking a little extra time. ADL They are likely to be able to attend to tasks of personal care. However, they may have problems with communication and may need a variety of types of communication support. The most common are lipspeakers, speech -to-text reporters, and notetakers. Communication support may be provided professionally or informally, for example by family or friends with the requisite abilities. They are likely to be able to identify common hazards in the home with appropriate amplification. Severe Functional Restriction - Hearing loss 71 dB or more but see disabling effects below Note that this includes people with severe and profound hearing loss. Category Description Disabling Effects They will be more dependent on communication devices such as a textphone or videophone than those with a moderate condition. They are likely to lip read, but if BSL is the person's first language, they may have no or limited lipreading skills. They are likely to use manual communication if the onset of hearing loss was before the development of language skill s (pre-lingual deafness). Prelingually deaf adults may also have difficulties with written English. They may be eligible for a cochlear implant, but this is unsuitable for many deaf adults, particularly those who are prelingually deaf. They will be unabl e to hear and understand a raised voice at 1 metre. (Although in ideal conditions with aids they may be able to hear a raised voice, this may be adversely affected by background noise). Speech may be affected such that they may not be understood clearly by strangers. Mobility The ability to walk is likely to be unimpeded. These people will be unable to hear speech and may rely on lip reading or British Sign Language (BSL) if they are skilled in these methods, however they will still have problems with communication unless accompanied by a BSL interpreter. In addition, they may not be able to hear traffic and other hazards adequately, for example to enable them to be aware of a hazard approaching outside their field of vision. They may also have difficul ty with judging the direction, distance, or velocity of the source of the sound. Those who are prelingually deaf may have unintelligible speech and if the person cannot read or write, may not be able to find their way about on unfamiliar routes. People wi th this level of functional restriction may have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and may require guidance outdoors. However, in the absence of other factors such as a learning disability, significant visual problem or mental health problems, this may be compensated for by increased visual awareness and by taking a little extra time. They may also satisfy the H/R Mobility criteria under the Severely Visually Impaired (SVI) or the deaf/blind deeming provisions. Click on Deeming provisions and consult the Vision guidance. ADL They are likely to be able to attend to tasks of personal care. However, they will have problems with communication and will be unable to hear speech and may rely on lip reading or British Sign Language (BSL) if they are skilled in these methods. BSL users need to use a BSL interpreter for the translation of spoken English to BSL and vice versa. If they have difficulties with written English they may also need translation of the written word to BSL and vice versa. Those who do not use BSL may need a variety of other types of communication support. The most common are lipspeakers, speech - to-text reporters, and notetakers. Communication support may be provided professionally or informally, for example by family or friends with the requisite abilities. There are many environmental aids available, which may help in some situations. If there is any doubt about the level of functional r estriction seek medical services advice. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? For people with recent onset of hearing loss, from whatever cause, in view of the potential response to treatment, the prognosis is uncertain for the first 12 months and it would be reasonable to award for a limited period whilst awaiting the outcome of response to treatment. For people who have had recent surgical interventions, such as Cochlear Implants, Middle Ear Impl ants and Bone Anchored Hearing Aids, the response to treatment varies. Therefore, a review after 12 months should be undertaken and further medical evidence obtained at that time. For people with hearing loss of onset in childhood, or onset more than 5 years ago, a long -term award may be considered. However, further medical evidence should first be obtained to confirm that a specialist unit has carried out an assessment and that no medical or surgical intervention is considered appropriate. Factors such a s the physical health, mental state and any other co -existing disablement may impair and prolong the period of learning and rehabilitation in an individual case.

Back to top of section Hearing Impairment in people over 65 The symptoms and management of hearing loss in the elderly are similar to those in a younger age group.

Self-assessment is the prime source of evidence but the claim pack should be checked t o see who has completed it and that it is an accurate and reliable description of their problems. If the claim pack has been completed on behalf of the customer, by someone who has a good understanding of his or her needs, then it could provide good evidence. Hospital Factual Report The Cardiac Rehabilitation Nurse General Practitioner Factual Report HCP Examination Report Medical Services Hospital Factual Report In all cases of moderate and severe cardiac disease a Consultant Cardiologist, and a Specialist Cardiac Nurse would normally have been involved in the diagnosis, management and treatment of the individual. Indeed the absence of any documented history of a Cardiology consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if required. If a person has undergone a successful he art transplant, the claimant will be followed up in the hospital Outpatient Department, and this will be the best source of information for his/ her residual needs. The Cardiac Rehabilitation Nurse The Cardiac Rehabilitation Nurse is a Specialist nurse , who works in close contact with the Cardiologist and is part of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Team. She/he is closely involved with the patient, from the start of the hospital stay, and, as well as attending to the physical needs of the patient, is crucial in advising, and supporting the patient. Heart failure patients suffer from an enormous impact on their confidence in their ability to do things and a large proportion of them suffer from depression and the Specialist Nurse is there to support them. She/he also can act as an intermediary between the Consultant (and the rest of the team) and the patient, giving advice on medication, dose adjustments, lifestyle, social issues and so on. He/she is also in a position to tell the patient about their illness and discuss things like prognosis, which may be worrying the patient, as well as being an important issue. This contact is kept up after the patient is discharged, for both medical and psychological reasons; and phone contact, for reassurance of the patient, may take place several times a week, in cases of severe heart failure. At late - stage or end - stage disease, the patient may contact the nurse many times because of the need for psychological, financial or social support and for advice on managing often quite complex treatment regimes. Obviously, the amount of contact varies with the severity of the condition and the readiness of the patient to seek help. The Specialist Nurse can also act as a go - between for the patient, GP and Consultant co -ordinating and adjusting the treatment options. Therefore, this role is recognized as being extremely important for the well - being of the patients and more and more hospitals use their services on a permanent basis. General Practiti oner Factual report The General Practitioner would normally have made the initial referral of the claimant to the Cardiologist and would normally be aware of the results of tests and current medication. The general practitioner may not have such detailed knowledge of the claimant's needs if he/ she is more frequently managed by the Consultant Cardiologist and the Specialist Cardiac Nurse, (who are more likely to have detailed knowledge of exercise tolerance and the disabling effects of the condition). If there is no specialist health professional involvement or evidence cannot be obtained from them, then a factual report from the claimant's own doctor would be more appropriate. HCP examination Report An HCP examination report would be likely to be necessary when t he person claims significant disability (equivalent to a moderate or severe condition), but there is no supporting evidence from the GP or hospital Specialist; if no corrobor ative evidence has been able to be obtained; or if it is the only means whereby the claimant's needs can be clarified. Medical Services The Medical Services doctor may be asked to request relevant information such as test results from the GP or Hospital Consultant and to interpret test results and other information. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disa bling Effects The person with mild heart failure is likely to have some shortness of breath on greater than ordinary exertion (such as running for a bus, running upstairs). See Functional classification . Mobility They would normally be able to walk 500 metres or more on the flat. There would be no need for guidance or supervision. ADL These people are breathless on extra exertion. Therefore they are likely to be somewhat breathless on running for a bus or running upstairs but still would normally be able to do this. A person with mild heart failure should, however be able to manage to look after all their own bodily functions without assistance. That is, bathing, dressing, attending to his/her own toilet n eeds and planning, preparing and cooking a main meal for one person. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects With moderate heart failure, the affected person would normally be breathless on doing mild (ordinary) exertion. See Functional classification . Mobility They would normally be breathless on mild exertion, but would normally be able to walk more than 100 -200 metres, at a slower than usual pace. They avoid inc lines, normally and limit their activity, according to their capability. There would be no need for guidance or supervision. ADL He/ she would still be likely to be able to carry out daily activities at a slower than normal pace. The condition may fluctuate. He/ she would normally be able to bath and dress/undress him/herself without assistance but may at times need help getting out of the bath. He/she should be able to manage his/her own toilet needs and plan, prepare and cook a main meal for one. He/she would normally have to take stairs slowly and would normally be likely to stop for a brief time on the stairs. At night he/she would normally not be able to lie flat but would normally sleep propped up on 2 or 3 pillows. Attention at night for assistance with toilet needs is not likely to be usual. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects A person with severe heart failure would normally have severe functional limitations and be breathless on slight (minimal) exertion or at rest. See Functional classification . A condition called acute Pulmonary Oedema may occur and is life - threatening. He/she would normally have been admitted to hospital, within the previous 12 months, because of deterioration of health. Mobility He/she would not normally be able to make more than 20 -30 yards, on the flat, before developing extreme breathlessness and could only manage stairs with extreme difficulty, hills being out of the quest ion. There would be no need for guidance or supervision. ADL Severe heart failure has a huge and overwhelming impact on daily life. A person with severe heart failure would normally move around very slowly and frequently be housebound. They would normally require help with most aspects of self -care, i.e. getting in and out of bed, getting dressed and undressed, bathing and getting to and on and off the toilet. Also because of breathlessness and fatigue a person with a severe condition (though likel y to be able to plan and prepare part of a meal while sitting) would not normally be able to lift a pan of boiling water safely and would be too breathless to bend to get something out of the oven. At night, with severe heart failure, he/she would not nor mally be able to lie flat and would normally sleep propped up on several pillows and the affected person would normally be likely to need assistance to rearrange pillows and to get in and out of bed to use a toilet or commode. However, if a bottle is place d conveniently within reach a person would normally be able to use a bottle but not to empty it.

The prognosis is worse with increasing age and probably in males. Prognosis in he art failure depends on the severity of the disease and the presence of complications, such as arrhythmias. Higher concentrations of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are commonly associated with increased risk of death and other adverse cardiovascular event s. It also depends on what has caused the heart failure in the first place. 10% of patients, with mild to moderate heart failure die within a year, Over 50% of patients with severe heart failure die within the first year after diagnosis. Advanced heart failure is regarded as fitting into the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of class 3 to class 4 symptoms. Patients with severe heart failure are prescribed Metolazone (a Thiazide diuretic). Patients in the terminal stage of the disea se are prescribed Diamorphine. Prognosis in the Older Person The 5 - year survival rate for older persons with established heart failure is less than 50% - that is worse than for most forms of cancer. Advanced heart failure in older persons carries a one - year mortality rate of 25% to 50%. Impairment Award Period Cardiac / Heart Failure Indefinite award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Heart Failure in people over 65 Cardiac Failure is predominantly a disease of older persons: - It occurs in 1 in 10 of the over 65's. 5% to 10% of people in their 80's are affected. Both the incidence and prevalence of chronic cardiac failure are rising, because of better care of coronary events, and hence better survival, more emphasis on preventative medicine, with respect to vascular risk factors in the ageing population, and more older people in the population (currently, around one quarter of the population is over 60 in the UK, but by 2030, this will have risen to one third). The causes are usually coronary heart disease, especially in t he Caucasian population, whereas hypertension (high blood pressure) is likely to be a predisposing factor in the Afro -Caribbean population. Older patients with chronic heart failure are more likely to be female, with pre - existing high blood pressure, and p reserved left ventricular function; diastolic dysfunction is also a prominent feature, especially those with a history of high blood pressure. Other causes of heart failure in older patients are: - Degenerative heart valve disease, Arrhythmias, Pulmonary hypertension (e.g. as a result of COPD - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), High cardiac output states (e.g. as a result of anaemia, Paget's Disease and thyroid disease), Cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis may be difficult, because of other co-existing disease, possible multiple medications and their effects, and complicating factors such as dementia. Because of age -related changes in the cardiovascular and other organ systems in the older person, there is the likelihood of increased severity of symptoms, possible complication in the management, and a worsened prognosis, as well as the increased likelihood of developing cardiac failure. Also, the dosage of many of the medications including those for cardiac failure should be the lowest effecti ve dose, because kidney and liver function may be reduced, older patients often receive multiple drugs for multiple conditions, and there are drug interactions and adverse effects of which to be aware. Chronic cardiac failure is an important cause of chro nic disability in older adults with physical and psychological effects of: - Breathlessness, Poor exercise tolerance, Reduction in activity, Isolation, Depression and anxiety, Possible poor cognitive state. The management of cardiac failure in older pati ents is similar to that of younger patients; however cardiac failure in the older person is best treated using a co -ordinated multidisciplinary team approach. A full medical management plan should follow Consultant Cardiologist assessment and involve the G P and/or a Specialist Cardiac Failure Nurse at a heart failure follow -up clinic or a day hospital. with particular facilities for older people, and/or those who are frail. Important factors, which would be monitored, are: - Medication supervision and adj ustment of medication according to the NICE Guidelines (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), bearing in mind side -effects and drug interactions, Lifestyle factors, such as nutrition, alcohol intake, exercise (Tai Chi has documented physi cal and psychosocial benefits and is used in some cardiac rehabilitation programmes), Treating the cause, if possible (for example, corrective operation for aortic stenotic valvular disease or treatment for atrial fibrillation), Addressing social factors, including isolation, inability to attend follow -ups, the need for social support or a carer, Cognitive assessment and assessment for depression. (Frequently used tests are the Mini Mental State Examination, the Abbreviated Mental Test Score, the Clock Draw ing and Mini - Cog and the Geriatric Depression Scale). Back to top of section Functional classification of Cardiac disease The New York Heart Association Functional Classification of Cardiac Disease Class 1 No functional limitation. Class 2 Symptoms on extra exertion i.e. mild heart failure. Class 3 Symptoms on ordinary physical activity i.e. moderate heart failure. Class 4 Symptoms at rest or on minimal exertion i.e. severe heart failure and severe functional limitation. This classification is now in common use.

Read more about effects in the over 65 age group. What evidence is available? People with HIV should be under the care of a multidisciplinary team, usually in a hospital based specialist centre which is responsible for initiating and monitoring antiretroviral (ART) and other therapy. Therefore, if further medical evidence is required, and the person is under the care of a Consultant , a hospital factual report should be sent. If the person is under the care of the General Practitioner alone, a GP factual report should be sent. In some circumstances the GP may be unaware of the diagnosis if the person is unde r the care of the hospital and has requested that the GP is not informed of the diagnosis. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Mobility and ADL needs may arise from any of the conditions associated with HIV. It should be noted that, although the CD4 count is an important indicator of a person's wellbeing, all factors should be taken into account. For example, people on treatment may have a CD4 count >350/\u00b5l but may be significantly debilitated due to either severe side effects of trea tment or HIV associated conditions. Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a mild restriction are likely to have: CD4 count >350/\u00b5l. They are likely to be asymptomatic although they may have enlarged lymph glands . or CD4 count >200/\u00b5l with relatively non disabling problems such as: Sexually transmitted diseases Mouth conditions Skin conditions Minor side effects of medication Mobility The ability to walk is unlikely to be impeded and they would normally be able to find their way around in unfamiliar places. ADL The resulting disability is unlikely to affect their ability to independently carry out activities of daily living. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a moderate restriction are likely to have a CD4 count >100 and < 200 /\u00b5l. The resulting disability depends upon the condition present and the response to treatment. For example, the following conditions may have varying effects on mobility and the ability to carry out activities of daily living -: Respiratory e.g. pneumonia or tumour Neurological e.g. neuropathy Tumours advanced diarrhoe a Haematological problems e.g. anaemia Psychiatric or social disabilities resulting from HIV or its treatment Each case will therefore need to be assessed individually. Mobility The ability to walk may be impeded and they may not be able to find their way around in unfamiliar places, but this depends upon the associated condition and response to treatment. ADL The resulting disability may affect their ability to independently carry out activities of daily living, but this depends upon the associ ated condition and response to treatment. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a severe restriction are likely to have a CD4 count < 100 /\u00b5l associated with -: Advanced carcinoma HIV encephalopathy Primary Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) Systemic to Cytomegalovirus retinitis Uncontrollable diarrhoea Psychiatric or social disability resulting from HIV o r its treatment Mobility The ability to walk is likely be impeded and they may not be able to find their way around in unfamiliar places. ADL The resulting disability is likely to affect their ability to independently carry out activities of daily living. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Without treatment, about 50% of people infected with HIV will become ill and die from AIDS over about 10 years. The mortality for HIV positive people has fallen from about 30% per year to about 2% since the introduction of HAART. The average survival of a person starting HAART is now probably 20 years or more. One study from Denmark has shown that a newly infected person at age 25 is now expected to live to 57.5 years or 63.9 years if not co -infected with hepatitis C. This compares with a life expectancy for a non -HIV infected person of 76.2 years. If evidence shows that the customer has HIV / AIDS with Hepatitis C then go to Viral Hepatitis guidance for additional information. A poorer prognosis in HIV positive people starting treatment i.e. an increased probability of progression to AIDS is associated with -: A lower CD4 count and higher plasma viral load Advanced age Infection through injecting drug use People with the most favourable prognostic factors are estimated to have a 3.5% chance of progression to AIDS or death within 3 years -: aged < 50 years old not infected through injection drug use viral load < 100 000 copies/ml CD4 cell count > 350 /\u00b5l on initiation of HAART People with the most unfavourable prognostic factors are estimated to have a 50% chance of progression to AIDS or death within 3 years -: Severe seroconversion illness aged 50 years old infecte d through intravenous drug use viral load 100 000 copies/ml CD4 cell count < 50 /\u00b5l on initiation of HAART Inability to take HAART/ART or poor compliance Drug resistant virus Other poor social circumstances Once the claimant's condition has deteriorated to the extent that care and mobility needs are established it is likely that there will be a subsequent deterioration, perhaps leading to death. However, the progress of the illness may not become clear until two years after the onset of the diagnosis of advanced HIV.

Care and mob guidance is divided into two groups -: Relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma First line treatment of Hodgkin Lymphoma First line treatment of Hodgkin Lymphoma A return to health is expected in the typical case. There are unlikely to be any long term care and mobility needs after treatment. The exception to this are the enduring but rare side effects of chemotherapy Relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma This group are likely to under go salvage chemotherapy followed by high dose chemotherapy a nd Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant (PBSCT) or bone marrow transplant. Treatment and recovery for those who successfully undergo this treatment is likely to take 18 months to 2 years. During this period they are likely to have periods of being immunos uppressed and be advised to avoid crowded public places. Episodes of severe fatigue may endure for many months related to chemotherapy treatment and anaemia. Some will be unwell and have care or mobility needs for about 3 -6 months - during the transplant and transplant recovery period. Others will develop needs related to chemotherapy side effects during standard chemotherapy, if this happens and they progress straight to high dose chemotherapy needs are likely to last through the first course and into th e transplant period. Recovery from the transplant is likely to be more prolonged in this group and may take a year. The main cause of needs is likely to be severe chemotherapy related fatigue. If high dose chemotherapy has already been used then other ty pes of chemotherapy may be to be given to control disease and symptoms, in this case ongoing needs may relate to symptoms of disease as well as treatment. Mobility Severe fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance related to any of the following may reduce the ability to walk Chemotherapy treatment Anaemia Disease effects e.g. lung involvement causing breathlessness People who are immunosuppressed may be advised to avoid public places at busy times. Activities of Daily Living Severe fatigue may make activities of daily living difficult. Help with activities of daily living from someone else may be required because of pain, fatigue or breathlessness. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? First line treatment In the rare situation where an award is appropriate during treatment with standard chemotherapy, the award should last for the duration of treatment and then be reviewed. Relapse The five year survival of people who have had one relapse of lymphoma is 50%-60%; Needs are likely to be identified in this group, time limited awards with review are recommended to cover duration of treatment and recovery. 40 -50% will die as a result of first relapse and survivors are likely to have ongo ing needs. Up to date medical evidence will be vital at any review of award. People whose disease relapses a second or third time do less well and in this group long term or life awards are more appropriate - some may be terminally ill. Long term side ef fects some years after successful treatment Any needs arising from these are likely to be long term and life awards are recommended.

General Practitioner Consultant Specialist Nurse Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with mild restriction from angina are well most of the time as the attacks ar e intermittent and usually only occur with greater than ordinary exertion. The attacks are quickly resolved by GTN (glyceryl trinitrate) spray or tablets. Mobility Walking would normally be unlimited, provided it is done at the speed expected for that person's age, and level of fitness. Guidance or supervision needs are unlikely to be present. ADL A person with mild restriction from angina would not normally experience pain and/or breathlessness, with the exertion required for self -care activities, such as bathing, dressing, attending to his/her hygiene needs and preparing a main meal for him/her. There would normally be no need for supervision, on a daily basis, either in or out doors. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with moderate restriction from angina are susceptible to an attack if they \"push themselves\" beyond normal exertion levels. Therefore, their angina attacks are intermittent, but occur at a level of moderate exertion. Normally they would often be likely to use preventative GTN (glyceryl trinitrate) before anticipated exercise or stress, and avoid exertion such as inclines, walking briskly, hurrying up stairs, going out in cold weather, and large meals. They may impose quite severe restrictions on their own activities, for fear of angina. Mobility He/she would normally be able to walk a distance of a few hundred metres, at a steady, or slightly reduced pace, using GTN spray preventatively, if necessary. He/she may have problems keepi ng up with another person of the same age. Guidance or supervision needs are unlikely to be present. ADL A person with moderate restriction from angina would not normally experience pain and breathlessness with self - care activities, although preventative GTN may sometimes be needed, e.g. to get up, bathe, dress, use the toilet unaided, and prepare and cook a simple meal. He/she may need to take GTN spray before going upstairs, but would normally be able to go up one flight of stairs, without G TN, albeit at a reduced pace. He/she would not normally need supervision, in or out of doors. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects A person with severe restriction from angina would normally experience angina on minimal exertion, such as dressing and drying self after a bath or shower, and the angina may be associated with breathlessness. Mobility A person with severe restriction from angina would normally only be able to walk between 50 to 100 metres, without s topping, at a normal pace, due to angina and/or breathlessness. These people, for fear of angina, often impose quite severe restriction on all daily activities, on themselves. There will be a minority of people however, with severe IHD who Are able to walk less than 50m. A report should be obtained from a consultant or medical services advice sought in such cases. Guidance or supervision needs are unlikely to be present. ADL Most people with severe restriction from angina would normally be able to undertake self-care tasks, slowly but unaided. Prophylactic (preventative) GTN may be needed. They would normally be unable to climb one flight of stairs, without needing to stop and rest for a few minutes, and would normally take GTN spray either as a pr eventative measure, before doing so, or to relieve angina, afterwards. There are a minority of people with very severe angina, who would need assistance with self - care tasks, and because they would normally have a severe restriction in physical activity, could not manage stairs. These people would normally be in hospital. Linked pages -: Medical Research Council Dyspnoea scale Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Coronary or ischaemic heart disease is a progressive disease, but the prognosis has improved with effective therapy, and with good surgical treatment. Modifications to lifestyle such as stopping smoking, ch anging diet and increasing exercise also reduce risk and improve prognosis. The type of intervention depends upon whether the extent of coronary artery disease is single vessel, 3 vessel or left main stem vessel. Prognosis for high -risk patients with mult i-vessel disease or main vessel disease or impaired left ventricular function is improved by surgery. In fact those who have had successful surgery or Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) are subsequently normally free of angina and have a good quality of life.

Back to top of sec tion Coronary (Ischaemic) Heart Disease in people over 65 Ageing \u2014general comments There are various effects of ageing in the cardiovascular system, which include: - 1. A slightly enlarged heart, which does not pump as efficiently during exercise. 2. Stiffer a rteries 3. Isolated systolic hypertension (where the blood pressure rises when the heart contracts). Heart disease and the Elderly The prevalence of risk factors for heart disease increases with increasing age, and coronary artery disease is clinically evide nt in 20% of those over 80 years. However, the symptoms of ischaemic heart disease in the elderly may present differently, (breathlessness rather than chest pain, or \"silent angina\" in diabetics). Elderly people may modify their lifestyle to avoid the onset of angina, may be used to having chest pains for a long period of time, (and not seeking help), and may present later with a heart attack, than younger people. In the elderly, co -existing conditions such as anaemia and thyroid disease, heart failure and arrhythmias are common and may worsen angina. In the elderly, angina may be caused by another condition (aortic stenosis - a tight aortic valve), and this should be considered as a cause, and ruled out, when angina is investigated. Preventative meas ures and lifestyle changes with the aim of lowering risk factors are just as important in the elderly, but medication should be introduced gradually, and in lower doses because of the risk of adverse side effects and drug interactions. Angioplasty and CAB G can and should be used as treatment measures, but the risks of mortality, and side effects from the procedures are increased, and the benefits have to be weighed against the risks, in elderly people. Diffuse disease may be present, and not amenable to pr ocedures. Back to top of section What you need to know about Kidney cancer Back to A - Z What is Kidney cancer?

The recovery time form these operations are up to 12 weeks. There are not usually any long term side effects of this type of surgery except those listed under surgery in the treatment section. Chemotherapy is sometimes used in the treatment of transitional cell cancer but not renal cell cancer; it may prolong recov ery to 8 -9 months or rarely give rise to enduring side effects. Recovery of normal function is expected in the typical case. Radiotherapy is rarely used so the long term side effects of these treatments are unlikely to be a problem for this group. Stage 4 , advanced or recurrent renal cancer after treatment of any stage of the disease The majority of people are terminally ill; the median survival for this group is 10 months with treatment. The five year survival is 10%. They may experience any of the follo wing symptoms related to their kidney cancer: Haematuria(blood in the urine) Anaemia, this may be recurrent due to repeated bleeding and causes extreme fatigue and difficulty walking around Pain from invasion by the tumour and 'clot colic' this is pain fr om blockage of the ureter by blood clots and can be severe There may be disabling effects from metastatic disease anywhere in the body including: Liver metastases - these may cause fatigue and in the later stages, mental confusion, abdominal swelling or pain and jaundice Lung metastases or malignant pleural effusion - may cause very disabling breathlessness reducing mobility to a few yards. Brain metastases - these may cause fits, personality change, confusion, difficulties with balance, walking and self care Bone metastases - pain and pathological fractures - this is a common cause of serious disability in this group.

Stage 4 - the cancer is locally advanced - has invaded surrounding structures or has metastasised T4 N0 or N1 M0 Any T and N2 M0 Any T any N and M1 This group has a poor outcome; unless metastasis is very limited and treated by surgery - see 'operations for metastatic disease' in the treatment section. Once treatment of early disease is complete typically there are no long term disabling effects. Advanced disease and recurrent disease have a poor outcome and most will be terminally ill. Needs are likely to increase over time and recovery is not expected.

If the claim pack has been completed on behalf of the customer, by someone who has a good understanding of his or her needs, then it should provide good evidence. Hospital Factual Report In cases of acute and chronic kidney disorders, renal transplant and dialysis, a Consultant Nephrologist and a Specialist Renal Nurse would normally have been involved in the diagnosis, management and treatment of the individual. Indee d the absence of any documented history of a specialist consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if required. General Practitioner Factual report The General Practitioner would normally have made the initial referral of the claimant to the Consultant, and would normally be aware of the results of tests, treatment and current medication. If there is no specialist health professiona l involvement, or if evidence cannot be obtained from them, then a factual report from the claimant's own doctor would be more appropriate. HCP Examination Report A HCP Examination report would be likely to be necessary when t he person claims significant disability (equivalent to a moderate or severe condition), but there is no supporting evidence from the GP or Hospital Specialist; if no corroborative evidence has been able to be obtained; or if it is the only means whereby the claim ant's needs can be clarified. Medical Services The Medical Services doctor may be asked to request relevant information such as test results from the GP or Hospital Consultant, and to interpret test results and other informa tion. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Kidney Dialysis Patients Chronic Kidney Disease Patients Unsuccessful Kidney Transplant Patients Kidney Dialysis Patients Introduction All family members are affected, pati ents and families must learn to incorporate new treatments and changes to their lifestyles. This change to lifestyle can lead to behavioural and psychological illness. There are limitations to travel and holidays. Some patients continue to work. Working h owever is often difficult due to the treatment restrictions and a person's lack of general well being. Renal patients are required to restrict their dietary and fluid intake, and fluid restriction can be 500mls per day. Dietary restrictions are dependant on a person's individual blood results. Examples of restricted foods are fruit, chocolate, coffee, dairy products, alcohol. There is normally a requirement for transport to and from the Hospital. This can be provided by Patient transport Ambulance servi ce, which results in long waiting times for patients before and after dialysis treatment. Some patients will be able to drive their own cars following treatment this is dependant on their general well being. Haemodialysis Haemodialysis is a very robust tre atment, which makes the patient feel very tired. This is because of huge fluxes in their metabolism. Haemodialysis takes place in a dialysis suite situated either in hospital or in the patient's own home. During haemodialysis the person is immobile and de pendent on others for his/her needs, and requires monitoring for indications of the effectiveness of the treatment and signs of any complications. Changes in blood pressure are usually recorded regularly throughout the period of haemodialysis. Because of rapid changes which can occur in blood pressure and in the movements of salts and/or water into and out of the body during dialysis, and the risks of danger these may pose, there is a reasonable need for continual supervision during the periods of haemodia lysis. Peritoneal Dialysis In a person who is otherwise physically and mentally well, attention or supervision would not normally be necessary. However, many patients who undergo Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) and Ambulatory Peritoneal D ialysis (APD) are elderly. Most people with CAPD increasingly require the input of helpers. They may basically be independent, but in many situations, help is required from family members. The requirement for dialysis will reduce a person's physical independence. In the many cases complicated by extremes of age, blindness, mental impairment, or severe physical weakness preventing the lifting of the bags of fluid it is unlikely that the affected individual will be able to complete the process without a great deal of help. In these cases, the complicating condition as well as the dialysis will have an effect on the overall care and mobility needs. The occurrence of the following disabilities in those undergoing CAPD or APD will likely require assistance from another one or more times a day: (i) Severe physical frailty from any cause (e.g. Anaemia , which is common in renal failure); help may be needed with the lifting of the bags, which can be heavy - bags used in AP D hold approximately 12 litres of fluid whereas those used in CAPD hold only 3 -4 litres of fluid. (ii) Blindness: the bags must be checked to make sure they are clear. Clouding may be a sign of infection or fibrin formation. The latter can block the conne cting tubes and is dealt with by an injection of heparin into the bag. (iii) Loss of manual dexterity: the changes of the bags needs considerable manual dexterity and must be carried out under meticulous aseptic (germ free) conditions. The function of the hands is very important. Persons with moderate to severe arthritis of the hands (e.g. Rheumatoid arthritis ) may well not be able to perform the actions without the assistance of another person. (iv) Extremes o f age: the very young and the very old may well need assistance with the changing of the bags. (v) Learning difficulties: This must be a consideration, however, in some centres, patients with learning difficulties undergo training in PD when they are acc epted onto the PD programme. Therefore they may not necessarily require assistance or supervision; each case would need to be assessed on its merits. Night attention is not normally needed on account of dialysis alone as the dialysing fluid is left in th e abdominal cavity overnight, changes taking place during the day. The dialysis machines have become smaller, but they are heavy and will require transporting in their travelling cases. This is a consideration in the frail, elderly and weak. Mobility Cons iderations Those doing well on dialysis should be able to walk, but around 50% of patients will not be able to walk 100 metres. All these cases will need to be assessed on their merits. Chronic Kidney Disease Patients Some patients may not even know that they have the condition or may not have extensive needs arising as a result of the condition. Others will experience significant and disabling weakness and fatigue. If chronic kidney disease progresses to end - stage renal failure, treatment requiring dial ysis or transplantation will be necessary to sustain life, and the care and mobility needs will be that of a person undergoing dialysis or who has had a transplant. Unsuccessful Kidney Transplant Patients If a person has chronic graft rejection, there will be a slow decline in renal function more than 3 months after transplantation, not responding to treatment. It will be obvious after a three month period post - transplant whether further treatment in the form of dialysis is needed. These patients will expe rience significant and disabling weakness and fatigue. A return to dialysis will be needed while a new transplant is awaited, however a new transplant may not be forthcoming for a considerable time. The treatment can vary between haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and transplant, and each method of treatment can be revisited more than once. The care and mobility needs of the individual therefore will be dependant on what sort of treatment the person is having at the time.

The overwhelming majority of people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are under the care of general practitioners and do not need to be seen by secondary or tertiary hospital services. There is no specific waiting list for dialysis. Following transplantation, acute rejection is seen in between 10 and 30% of transplant recipients and usually pre sents with declining renal function within the first 3 months.

Back to top of section Over 65 Kidney function normally declines with age, not only because the kidneys get smaller but also because of reduced efficiency of the individual components in the kidney. However, the kidneys can usually deal with the workload, unless stressed by extra factors then the ageing kidney has a reduced capacity to manage stress. The main causes of renal failure in the elderly are hypertension, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Kidney failure in the elderly can cause a significant decline in independence and physical wellbeing. Chronic renal failure is a disease of older p eople but their age should not be an obstacle to treatment as long as overall health allows. Back to top of section Kidney Dialysis - Deeming Provisions Two groups of people with renal failure and undergoing dialysis treatmen t two or more times a week may be considered as \"deemed\" to satisfy one or more of the medical criteria of the middle rate care component of Disability Living Allowance or the lower rate of Attendance Allowance. These are -: 4. Those undergoing a type of dia lysis, which normally requires the attendance or supervision of another person during the period of dialysis. 5. Those who because of the particular circumstances of their case in fact require another person, during the period of dialysis, to attend in conne ction with their bodily functions or to supervise them in order to avoid substantial danger. There are however exceptions to the above as set out below -: A person cannot be deemed to satisfy either the day condition or the night condition if the renal di alysis 6. Is carried out under the NHS and 7. Is out -patient treatment and 8. Is carried out 3.1 In a hospital or similar institution and 3.2 With the assistance or supervision of any member of the hospital staff These people may have other care and mobility needs, which also have to be taken into account when the overall needs are assessed.

For example radiotherapy and recovery or recovery from surgery. The exception to this is chemotherapy when it is given by itself over 6 cycles. If chemotherapy alone is being given, this treatment is likely to be palliative rather than curative. Side effects related to this treatment that result in needs during the first cycles are only likely to get worse through the treatment, a time limited award may be appropriate to cover this period. Rarely there may be the enduring side effec ts of chemotherapy treatment. Rarely there may be ongoing difficulties with swallowing which require special feeding ranging from soft diet to gastrostomy feeding. Most people with laryngeal cancer are likely to be mobile and self caring at 3 months post treatment, if needs are present they are likely to be related to: the ability to speak having a tracheostomy These difficulties are described in detail. The best source of evidence for assessment of needs will be the speech and language therapist who ha s most recently treated the claimant. Speech and people who have had a Partial Laryngectomy A person who has had this treatment will not have a permanent tracheostomy and will be able to speak with the remains of their larynx; it may take several months to become confident speaking to strangers. Their voice is likely to be weaker and hoarser than before. Likely difficulties include tiring of the voice when speaking for long periods and some difficulty being heard in noisy environments such as pubs, parties and shops. This is likely to be a significant problem for people who need their voices at work e.g. teachers, actors. Rarely tongue movement which makes many of the sounds of speech may be affected by treatment - this is likely to leave a person with a spe ech impediment as well as a weak voice. This often responds well to speech therapy but there may be a long period during which speech is unintelligible to strangers and confidence is lost. There may be problems with swallowing in the months after surgery ; this may occasionally involve aspirating or accidentally breathing in or choking on food whilst swallowing. Often this problem improves with time and patients will be taught techniques to enable safer swallowing. If this problem is persistent it is likel y to be a cause of embarrassment and may lead to social isolation. If help or supervision is required because of aspiration at mealtimes this is a care need. Aspiration is likely to be persistent if it is still a problem 12 months after surgery. Should the problem result in frequent difficulties or recurrent chest infections then in consultation with the patient and their family, further treatment in the form of a total laryngectomy may be offered. Speech and people who have had a Subtotal Laryngectomy After this surgery part of the larynx remains which enables a person to speak with an altered quiet hoarse voice. It may take months to become confident speaking to strangers. A tracheostomy will be in place and needs to be cared for. This may be temporary but as breathing becomes more confident may be removed. Likely difficulties include tiring or fatiguing of the voice when speaking for long periods and some difficulty being heard in noisy environments such as pubs, parties and shops. This is likely to be a significant problem for people who need their voices at work e.g. teachers, actors. Rarely, tongue movement which makes many of the sounds of speech may be affected by treatment - this is likely to leave a person with a speech impediment as well as a weak v oice. This often responds well to speech therapy but there may be a long period during which speech is difficult or unintelligible to strangers and confidence is lost. There may be problems with swallowing in the months after surgery; this may involve aspirating or accidentally breathing in food whilst swallowing. Often this problem improves with time and there are techniques to enable safer swallowing which can be learnt. If this problem is persistent it is likely to be a cause of embarrassment and may l ead to social isolation. If help or supervision is required because of aspiration at mealtimes this is a care need. Aspiration is likely to be persistent if it is still a problem 12 months after surgery. Speech and people who have had a total laryngectomy A person who has their whole larynx removed is called a total laryngectomee. They have no larynx at all to speak with and will need to learn to speak again. There are several ways of speaking without a voice box -: Oesophageal speech - a person swallows ai r and speaks (vocalises) by burping it back out again using resonance in the back of the throat (the pharynx) to make sounds. They may manage one word at a time within 6 weeks and be speaking in short sentences (3 - 4 words) within 6 months. Often even peo ple who speak really well using the technique speak more slowly than normal. The length of each sentence will be dependent upon the amount of air \"burped back\". Continued improvement in speech is likely for the first year. This type of speech is tiring at first and sounds very different to normal speech; it may be difficult for strangers to understand. Practical problems include making themselves heard and understood speaking over the telephone and in noisy environments - particularly to strangers. Psycholo gical problems may develop because of the inability to express emotion through the voice by moderating pitch or speak for long enough to express feelings or needs. It is possible to develop good speech using this technique but this is the exception rather than the rule, social isolation is common. Speech Valves - there are various types of one way valves which connect the oesophagus to the trachea. The sound is the same as oesophageal speech but the air doesn't have to be swallowed it comes through the one -way valve from the trachea to the oesophagus from the lungs. The hole is called a tracheo -oesophageal puncture (TEP). Mostly someone using one of these will have to close their tracheostomy by putting a finger over it every time they want to speak but some of them are 'hands free'. The names of the valves are: Blom -Singer Provox Groningen Problems are common with these valves; some people will not manage with them and have to use oesophageal speech or other speech aid. Common problems include -: Leakage through the valve of fluid into the trachea and lungs - this causes coughing. Candida infection around the valve -this is the main cause of leakage, regular anti -fungal drugs may be taken to control it. Leakage of the valve at the end of its life - they last around 6 months - the valve needs to be replaced usually at the hospital. When this occurs there will be problems including coughing and inability to speak until valve is changed. Dislodged valve - the valve may be inhaled rather than just falli ng out. Foreign bodies in the lung can cause severe 'aspiration' pneumonia if not removed straight away and the hole for the valve can close within a few minutes of dislodging meaning further surgery to put a new one in or adopting a new technique for spee ch. Some of these valve problems can be minimised or reduced if the patient or their relative can learn how to replace the valve themselves but not everyone can do this and periods of coughing, loss of speech and trips to the hospital may be a real burden. The effort of speaking with one of these is less than for oesophageal speech and the voice achieved can be louder. It takes time and practice to develop good speech using a valve. The disadvantages are that saliva can leak into the trachea and lungs thr ough the valve and they require more care and attention in terms of keeping them clean through the day. Under normal circumstances the valve needs cleaning twice a day with a special brush. More frequent cleaning is required if the person has a cough or a cold. When the valve blocks a person cannot speak, this may happen regularly. Speech is usually possible 6 -8 weeks after surgery and improves over the first year. This type of voice sounds very different to normal speech; it may be difficult for stranger s to understand. Practical problems include making themselves understood to strangers and speaking over the telephone. Having to place a finger over the stoma in the neck to speak draws other people's attention to the neck and can make a person feel more a bnormal and self conscious. Psychological problems may develop because of the inability to express emotion through the voice by moderating pitch or speak for long enough to express feelings or needs. It is possible to develop good speech using this techniq ue but not everyone can do this, social isolation is common. Electronic larynx - this is an electronic vibrating device which is held against the neck to enable speech. It can take up to a year to be able to use the device well enough to make strangers un derstand and the voice sounds mechanical. Practical problems include making themselves understood to strangers and speaking over the telephone. Psychological problems may develop because of the inability to express emotion through the voice by moderating p itch or speak for long enough to express feelings or needs. Whispering is not possible either. As one hand has to hold the device for speech, only one hand is free during speech. This makes it impossible to speak whilst driving, eating, preparing food etc. This is a less tiring method of speaking without a larynx and is often the option of last resort; the mechanical 'robotic' voice can be very off putting. Strangers may react very negatively to the voice particularly on the telephone and this is embarrassi ng and upsetting. Social isolation is common. About 20 -30% of laryngectomees do not communicate using the above methods, this is usually because caring for the valve was very frustrating and difficult or they disliked the sound of the new voice. People wh o do not have a voice have to attract attention first - by waving, clapping or tapping someone on the shoulder, they articulate words silently, make gestures, write or use picture charts. Communication difficulties are likely to cause terrible frustration and sometimes severe anxiety as the easiest and quickest means of summoning help when they are in distress is lost. Caring for a tracheostomy A tracheostomy is a hole in the neck that a person breathes through instead of breathing through the mouth; the ho le may be called a tracheostomy or a laryngectomy stoma. The airway is not connected to the mouth unless there is a one way speech valve in place. Nearly everyone needs some help caring for the tracheostomy and encouragement to eat and drink in the early m onths after surgery. A tracheostomy will leak mucus and become crusted over without care. Some people may need to change bedding and /or nightwear during the night due to excess mucus production. The hole can block with crust or mucus over 24 hours or soon er if a person has a cold. Blocking of the stoma is potentially life threatening. A person may need to attend to their stoma every few hours to keep it clean. This involves cleaning the stoma. Crusts need to be removed from the stoma to prevent blockage. Most people use cotton buds and tweezers to remove crusting. They may need to wear a device to keep the stoma open and clear: a 'tube' or a 'vent' or 'stoma button' as well as a protective dressing over the stoma. This stoma button needs to be removed an d cleaned regularly. The stoma needs to be protected from water e.g. during bathing, showering or the rain. Most people are able to manage themselves e.g. by wearing a shower shield. Protecting the stoma from the rain is difficult for those who cannot lift up their arms to hold an umbrella in the air because of neck surgery. Most people are also able to cough up mucus through their stoma most of the time and do not need home suction. Rarely a humidifier or home suction may be needed to keep the stoma functi oning - travelling away from home is likely to be restricted if this type of equipment is needed. If mucus is a problem and coughing is difficult the stoma may block from time to time - this is an emergency and will normally mean a carer has to be availabl e to perform suction when the laryngectomee cannot breathe. Mobility The nose and throat provide important protection and airflow resistance to the lower airways which help to keep the alveoli open and protected from cold and dryness. Closure of the vocal cords assists the effort of coughing considerably and also the ability to perform certain activities such as straining to lift a heavy object and straining to open the bowels. Consequently lifting heavy items, straining to open the bowels and coughing up m ucus are much harder than they were before. Techniques can be learnt to overcome the coughing difficulty but not the other difficulties. Secondly, the lower airways are much more open to irritants and damage and chronic lung problems on top of frequent cou ghs and colds and the need to protect the stoma may result. In order to prevent chronic lung damage humidification and filtration of air are necessity. Most patients wear a HME (heat and moisture exchanger) to conserve heat and moisture during expiration (breathing out), then returning it to the inspired air. Examples of HME's are -: Buchanan bibs Laryngofoam Deltanex protectors, etc People who have had a laryngectomy are more likely to have Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease and if breathlessness is severe or exercise tolerance much reduced walking is likely to be affected. Swallowing and diet Many people may have swallowing difficulties post -laryngectomy. Some people may need to liquidise food, make it semi -solid, or cut food up in to very small pieces. Extra attention to proper and careful swallowing may be necessary. This may make mealtimes prolonged, and the person may have to reheat food during a meal. Some people develop stricturing (tightening) of the neo -pharynx (reconstructed throat), making swallowing difficult and sometimes resulting in regurgitation problems during meals. Periodic stretching of the stricture under general anaesthetic may sometimes be required in order to continue with oral feeding. Acid reflux is a common p roblem. Patients may experience reflux of stomach contents into the mouth and throat, and this may be worse when bending forwards, or when lying down. Sleeping propped up in bed may be necessary, as may lifestyle and dietary modifications, and some may require medicine such as ranitidine, omeprazole (Losec) to control this reflux. Smell and taste are also greatly diminished, as air no longer flows through the nose and throat. Olfaction (sense of smell) plays a crucial role in the ability to appreciate the f lavour of food. Therefore, so called 'neck breathers' have a decreased enjoyment of eating. In addition to this, olfaction is important for monitoring the safety of the environment. Thus, the laryngectomee will not be alert to the smell of fire, gas leaks and the presence of toxins in food that has spoilt. Musculoskeletal problems Shoulder dysfunction - loss of shoulder function is a potentially distressing consequence of neck dissection. This may cause a significant loss of shoulder flexion and abduction, and shoulder pain and drooping may also be a problem. This restricted range of movement of the shoulder, and loss of function can impact on all activities of daily living related to shoulder function; for example, washing, dressing, combing hair, writing, reaching for objects above shoulder level, reaching into cupboards, hanging out washing, etc. Severe pain in the neck and shoulder (s) may also occur as a consequence; and this pain often increases when moving the shoulder and lying on the affected shoulde r. Neck tightness, stiffness, loss of sensation in the neck, or a feeling of constriction and restricted range of movement may also be a problem. This can impact on everyday activities, such as turning the head to watch for traffic and other dangers. The appearance of the neck may also lead to psychological problems. Psychological Effects Particular problems for people who have had laryngectomy in addition to the general psychological effects of cancer (see general notes) are related to quality of life wh ich may be severely impaired: Embarrassment because of altered voice or inability to speak Ability to swallow and enjoy food with others Cosmetic effect of having a hole in the throat, altered appearance of neck after neck dissection effects on taste and smell, They may become socially reclusive without help and support. Advanced, Recurrent or Metastatic Cancer A person who has had treatment for advanced laryngeal cancer may have any of the problems related to speech or care of a tracheostomy. In additio n to those problems there may be any of the symptoms of metastatic disease . Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Localised disease Rarely, needs may be identified due to chemotherapy related side effects which are expected to last for up to 6 months and a time limited award is recommended to cover this period. Speech problems There are likely to be severe difficulties with communication for anyone having surgery to remove part of or the entire larynx. For some these difficulties will persist. If surgery was less than eighteen months ago some improvement in communication is likely and a time limited award is recommended. If surgery was more than eighteen months ago and there are still needs related to commun ication a life award is recommended. Tracheostomy care When a person has other medical problems which are not expected to improve - perhaps restricted movement of the upper limbs or dexterity of the hands and is unable to self care for their stoma within a few months of surgery a life award is recommended. Similarly a person who is unable to cough and clear their stoma or who requires suction by a carer for blockages or to remove mucus to facilitate breathing more than a few months after surgery is likely to have ongoing needs and a life award is recommended. Advanced or Metastatic Cancer Life awards are recommended.

The claimant is generally not in a position to be able to provide the information required to accurately assess mobility and care needs. The necessary details are best obtained from the Carer, Consultant, Specialist Nurse or Occupational Therapist . It may be difficult to obtain recent medical evidence for adults with a learning disability, when they have limited contact with their general practitioners or hospital services , since their general health is satisfactory. However for older teenagers and young adults some reports and previous assessments, including those made by educational psychologists , may be available in their medical records or from the school or college they are attending -: Special Education Needs (SEN) Note: These reports should be accompanied by medical evidence wherever possible. They may also have been assessed by speech and language therapists, occupational therapists , social workers and other health care professionals who provide services for people with learning disabilities living in the community. Copies of reports may be obtained from community teams, social services or local authorities. This applies to tho se living at home and in residential accommodation. Customers or their carers may also have copies of these assessments or care plans. An assessment by a Health Care Professional is appropriate when disabilities are stable and long standing, and when oth er sources of evidence are not available, or give insufficient detail to ascertain the overall level of functional impairment.

Mild learning disabili ty and -: GP care only No behavioural problems Lives in unsupervised accommodation Attended mainstream school Employed with no support No legal protection in place No associated physical, psychiatric or other problems. Mobility A person with mild functional restriction would not be expected to have physical difficulties with walking. Nor would they require guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL People with a mild restriction should be able to live independently, though they may need help in coping with housing and employment, family responsibilities, planning complex activities or when under unusual stress. Consequently they would not normally be expected to have attention or supervision needs.

Moderate learning disability and -: Multidisciplinary community team care No behavioural problems Require intermittent supervision, i.e. can be left alone for prolonged periods of time Attended mainstream school with statement Supported employment No legal protection in place There may be associated problems that include -: Visual impairment Hearing impairment Motor disabilities Epilepsy Mobility The ability to walk is likely to be unimpeded in the absence of neuro -muscular problems affecting the lower limbs. They are likely to require guidance and supervision when finding their way around outdoors a s they may be vulnerable to exploitation, demonstrate disturbed or antisocial behaviour and have difficulty in communicating with strangers. ADL They are likely to require attention with prompting to wash, dress, prepare food, wear appropriate clothes and eat a proper diet. Also to partake in appropriate activities, to take medication and deal with correspondence and financial matters. They are not likely to require assistance with most aspects of bodily functions. They may need supervision to prevent potentially dangerous behaviours or activities.

Remember, this guidance refers to a number of different conditions and syndromes, some of which cause both mental and physical disability. This guidance covers the mental impairment aspect of the overall disability only. Appropriate guidance must be refe rred to where there is also any physical impairment. Impairment Down's syndrome Fragile X syndrome Learning disability - Other / type not known Learning disability runs a life long course with little change. Once care and mobility needs have been established they are unlikely to improve and a life award should be considered. However, intellectual or physical deterioration can occur in later life and may result in increasing care and mobility needs. A young adult assessed appropriately in chil dhood as having a moderate learning disability is unlikely to develop fully independent living skills and a child classified as having a severe learning disability is highly unlikely to develop such skills, even with ongoing education & training or mentori ng Impairment Award Period Learning disability i.e. Down's syndrome, Fragile X syndrome & Learning disability - Other / type not known Indefinite award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Over 65 People over 65 may experience the following problems: If the parents are the carers, they may find this increasingly burdensome, but may be reluctant to arrange alternative care for the person. If the parents die, bereavement may be especially difficult because of communication problems. Dementia affects people with learning disab ility at a younger age than the general population. A progressive decline in intellectual and social functioning may be the first manifestation of dementia. As the life expectancy of people with learning disability is increasing, dementia in later life is becoming more common. There is a particular association between Downs syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Further sources of evidence Claim pack Self-assessment is the prime source of evidence, but the claim pack should be checked to see who has completed i t. If the form has been filled in by the customer, due to the nature of their condition, it might not necessarily be an accurate or reliable description of their problems. If the claim pack has been completed on behalf of the customer, by someone who has a good understanding of his or her needs, then it could provide good evidence. The DM should bear in mind that the completion of the corroborative statement by a Health Care Professional does not necessarily mean that they endorse what has been said in th e claim pack. However, because of the complex nature of learning disability and the wide variation in resulting disablement, it is important to try to obtain medical evidence to support information provided by the customer whenever possible. Multi -discip linary community team People with learning disability who require active involvement or review will be under the supervision of a community team. Although the majority will have severe or moderate learning disability, those with mild learning disability wh o are considered at risk will also be under their supervision. A hospital factual report should be requested for completion by any member of the clinical team that may include a consultant psychiatrist, specialist nurse [learning disability] or occupation al therapist. A copy of a Community Care Act assessment form can also be requested at the same time. The following, if available, should also be requested: A copy of a completed standardised assessment, for example the Adaptive Behaviour Scale, as this is likely to provide good evidence about functional ability of the person. A copy of a Statement of Special Educational Needs as this is likely to provide good evidence of associated needs. General Practitioner (GP) People with learning disability who are not considered high risk and do not require involvement of the community team will be under the care of the primary care team and in this circumstance it is worth trying to obtain a factual report from the GP. A proportion of GPs keep a register of p eople with learning disability in their practice. Health Care Professional (HCP) Examination Report However, it is possible that the GP has no recent information relating to the person and in this event an HCP examination report would be required. Social Services and Local Authority Copies of previous assessments including educational assessments may be obtained from the Social Services department, Local Authority or carer in the absence of any current health care involvement. Accommodation manager When the claimant is living in supported accommodation then the type and level of support provided could be helpful in determining their need for help.

Desp ite aggressive consolidation therapy the majority of them (60%) will relapse again quite quickly. Further treatment may be able to control the disease for a little longer but will not cure it. Without bone marrow transplant treatment first relapse leads to death on average within a year. Long term survival after treatment depends on subtype of leukaemia and age. 2 year survival with ALL is 35 -40% for people under 55 years of age; for older people long term survival rates are lower. Most deaths from leuka emia occur within the first few years after diagnosis. Those who do become long term survivors are likely to have undergone arduous treatment in addition to being very ill with their leukaemia in the first place. It is recommended that if needs are identif ied that awards are made for two years. Those who are going to recover from their ALL are likely to have substantially done so at 2 years.

You should follow guidance on car e and mobility considerations for bone marrow and stem cell transplant if this treatment is being given. The treatment of chronic CML has improved a lot over the last few years and long term survival with treatment is common. About half of people who have bone marrow or stem cell transplant for chronic CML are cured of their disease and many others achieve long term survival on Imatinib.

Mobility People with mild liver failure are unlikely to have any persistent functional restrictions affecting physical mobility. There is unlikely to be a need for guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL People with mild liver failure are unlikely to have any persistent functional restrictions affecting care. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects The degree of functional limitation experienced by someone with chronic liver disease is caused mainly by liver failure. The individual features of each impairment need to be considered. There is likely to be persistent jaundice , muscle weakness, low body weight, poor nutritional status, susceptibility to infection, increasing ascites and portal hypertension are all indicators of an increasing level of functional limitation. Mobility Mobility may be limited due to severe fatigue and muscle weakness. There is unlikely to be a need for guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL Typically there may be increasing need for help with washing, dressing, stairs, rising from a chair etc. over time. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects Many people with end stage liver failure may be receiving palliative care only and their life expectancy may be expected to be less than six months. Mobility Walking is likely to be significantly restricted. This will include people awaiting a liver transplant. People with he patic encephalopathy may have a requirement for guidance or supervision out of doors resulting from long-term cognitive impairment. ADL People with advanced liver failure, including all the complications described under the moderate category, are likely t o require help with self -care. They may need help with moving around the house, rising from a chair, supervision of medication, and may be prone to falls.

This section applies to the smaller group who have had early lung cancer treated by surgery and long term survivors after chemo and radiotherapy. These are the minority of people with lung cancer (20 -30%). For lung cancer treated by surgery and chemotherapy or radiotherapy and chemotherapy; once the initial treatment is complete any residual disabling effects are permanent. Commonly they will have reduced exercise toleran ce due to breathlessness following -: Surgical removal of lung tissue Scarring of lung tissue from radiotherapy Associated COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Rarely Any of the general long term side effects from radio and chemotherapy Most usu ally there will be non -disabling breathlessness on exertion and no long term effects from adjuvant treatment. There may be significant anxiety about recurrent disease compared to people with other cancers with better long term outcomes. Of patients with no n-small cell cancer who have surgery 60 -80% Stage 1 and 25 -50% Stage 2 will survive 5 years. Metastatic disease (70 -80%) The majority of people will have metastatic disease from the day of diagnosis. With either type of lung cancer survival is poor. It is common in both types to be significantly disabled by -: Cough Breathlessness - this may be due to a 'pleural effusion' - this is a collection of fluid around the lung Chest pain Pain from metastases Tiredness Anorexia Depression Exercise tolerance may be significantly reduced due to the local effects of the tumour or by general weakness and tiredness associated with cancer related weight loss. Help may be required with all activities of daily living within a short time of diagnosis. When t his is due to breathlessness or general debility then mobility is also likely to be severely impaired. Pain can be well controlled with symptomatic treatment but may cause significant drowsiness. There may also be significant disability from metastases in other organs including -: Liver - these may cause fatigue and in the later stages, mental confusion, abdominal swelling or pain and jaundice Brain - these may cause fits, personality change, confusion, difficulties with balance, walking and self care Bone - severe pain and pathological fractures. Hypercalcaemia (raised calcium levels in the blood) may cause confusion, coma and death. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? In almost all cases, it is appropriate to make an indefinite award as life is likely to be short and disabling effects identified are likely to persist. Where treatment is very disabling but long term prognosis is good, a limited award for the duration of treatment and a reasonable recovery period is appropriate. If disease recurs after successful treatment an indefinite award is appropriate.

Therefore, further evidence would not usually be required. In cases where complications have occurred the re may be some ongoing disability. Intracranial infection may produce longer term neurological effects and in such cases medical evidence should be available to confirm any ongoing disability and this should be assessed on its own merit.

Such additional problems should also be evident from available information and should also be assessed as separate entities. Activities of Da ily Living and Mobility Considerations Mastoiditis is an acute illness and in most cases it resolves completely within ten days. During this period the patient, usually a child is unwell and may need to be hospitalised. When the acute attack has resolved t here should be no residual functional loss in most cases. Some cases present a more chronic low grade inflammation usually associated with chronic suppurative otitis media. There may be recurring attacks of pain and persistent discharge from the ear. In adults there should be no persistent loss of function without any ongoing need for help with personal bodily functions or difficulties with walking. Application of ear drops and cleansing of the ear aperture may be needed in some instances but unless ther e is another disabling condition to prevent the individual carrying out this activity there should be no need for help. Children form by far the largest group of cases but other than simple management and possible need for application of ear drops betwee n acute attacks they should not need any care beyond that required for a child of the same age. Regular follow -up visits to hospital may be necessary. In cases where complications have occurred there may be some ongoing disability. Intracranial infection may produce longer term neurological effects and in such cases medical evidence should be available to confirm any ongoing disability and this should be assessed on its own merit. Disruption of the inner ear caused by infection spreading from the middle ear may lead to hearing loss or disturbances of balance. Such additional problems should also be evident from available information and should also be assessed as separate entities. Variability Apart from short term problems generated by the acute illness there should be no significant variation in the condition or level of care needed. How long will the needs last? Most cases of acute mastoiditis resolve completely following effective treatment. Chronic mastoiditis may persist for several months. Recurrent episodes may occur and some may persist for more prolonged periods. Evidence of such persistence or the ongoing effects of complications may be needed to fully ascertain the prognosis.

Patients are usu ally well prior to infection, although immuno -compromised patients (such as those with AIDs or those taking immune supplement drugs) may be at increased risk of infection. How long will the needs last? Long - Term Effects Usually there are no long -term com plications or residual disability with viral meningitis. 85% of meningococcal meningitis sufferers make a full recovery within a few weeks (10 -15% suffer from persistent neurological defects including hearing loss, speech disorders, loss of limbs, or part s of limbs, learning difficulties and paralysis). Pyogenic and tuberculous meningitis, when recognised at an early stage in the disease and treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy usually results in complete recovery, with no long -term complications o r disability. Untreated Tuberculous Meningitis is fatal in a few weeks but complete recovery is the rule with modern treatment if it is started before the appearance of focal neurological signs or stupor. When treatment is started at a later stage the rec overy rate is 60% or less, and the survivors may be left with severe mental deficiency, epilepsy, deafness, blindness, or some other permanent neurological deficit. As with meningococcal disease, late diagnosis and consequent delay in treatment may result in permanent neurological damage, and long -term disability.

Between attacks the person would be expected to function normally apart from sensible adjustments to lifestyle to avoid known trigger factors. Therefore further evidence would not usually be required. There is a small increased risk of stroke in migraine sufferers. The rare cases that experience severe effects such as unconsciousness or paralysis are likely to be under the care of a neurologist particularly as other more sinister c auses of the symptoms need to be excluded. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs The acute attack of migraine can be troublesome and distressing. The severe head pain, nausea and vomiting can lead to the patient withdrawing to rest in a darkened ro om. Frequent attacks can disrupt the normal routine of life. However, even during the attack no specific impairment of function would be expected with no disabling loss of function of the limbs and no cardiovascular impairment. Even for those who suffer severe attacks, the intermittent nature of the condition means that the person is asymptomatic for most of the time. The condition can demoralise the person but during the attack there should not be any change in awareness or intellect. There is a small i ncreased risk of stroke in migraine sufferers. The rare cases that experience severe effects such as unconsciousness or paralysis are likely to be under the care of a neurologist particularly as other more sinister causes of the symptoms need to be exclude d. Between attacks the person would be expected to function normally apart from sensible adjustments to lifestyle to avoid known trigger factors. How long will the needs last? Migraine is usually an intermittent illness with complete recovery between attacks. It is not life threatening but if attacks occur frequently it can make life miserable. In most cases the attacks occur irregularly and infrequently. Sometimes they can occur at predictable periods of stress and in a small number of cases the attacks b ecome chronic, occurring several times a week if not daily. Cases of this severity would be expected to be under specialist management. Beyond age 50 years the condition tends to lessen and the condition may resolve.

Read more about award duration Over 65's Motor Neurone disease affects people in later life. There are no specific features in the elderly. What evidence is available? Neurologists, specialist nurses and general practitioners are able to provide reports confirming the diagnosis of motor neurone disease. Additional information regarding the ex tent of the disabling effects and treatments being used may be obtained from other multidisciplinary team members i.e. specialist nurses, physiotherapists , speech therapists, occupational therapists , comm unity nurses and social workers . The work of the health care professionals may be coordinated by one member of the team, who is designated the key worker or care coordinator. Many people experiencing rapidly progressive moto r neurone disease will be receiving palliative care. Evidence that death may be reasonably expected within six months can provided by general practitioners, hospice doctors, neurologists and palliative care nurses. Advice should be obtained from Medical Services to establish the stage of the disease, if it is not clear from medical reports. It is important to distinguish cases with rapidly progressive functional restrictions and a short life expectancy, from those cases of th e less common types of motor neurone disease who have a longer survival time. A HCP Examination report is likely to be useful only in the minority of cases with longer life expectancy, where the disabling effects of the condition ar e localised and less severe earlier in the disease. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Muscular weakness affecting the hands and forearms leads to initial difficulties in fine manipulations, g riping, lifting and carrying. Help will be needed with dressing, preparing food and personal hygiene. As the condition progresses to affect all the muscle groups of arms and shoulders, help will be required with all aspects of self -care including feeding a nd drinking. Weakness of the feet and lower legs causes unsteadiness in walking, a tendency to trip and a reduction in the distance that can be covered without undue fatigue. The ability to stand for prolonged periods, rise from a chair, to bend down and walk diminishes as the disease progresses. Help will be needed with cooking, with stairs, with the toilet and with moving around. It becomes difficult for the individual to turn in bed at night. As the condition affects both lower limbs walking become seve rely restricted, and people are likely to use a wheelchair outside and in the home. They will be unable to stand without support and be at risk of falls. A person with bulbar symptoms is likely to have devices and aids to facilitate nutrition, speech and respiration. Initially they may be able use these themselves if upper and lower limb function is not severely restricted. However symptoms are often rapidly progressive and the ability to use the devices will be compromised by fatigue, shortness of breath, weight loss and general debility, even if limb function remains reasonable. Elderly people with predominantly bulbar symptoms may be unable to learn how to use these devices/aids and need help from the outset. As limb function in people with bulbar palsy deteriorates they need help with all aspects of self -care, and walking starts to be restricted. Some people with bulbar symptoms may be able to walk until late in the course of the illness. However walking ability will be compromised to a degree in most people in this group by shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss, recurrent chest infections and the general debilitating nature of the condition. Overall people presenting with bulbar symptoms are likely to have a shorter life span than others. About 10% of people develop mild symptoms of dementia. However it is likely that their need for help with all aspects of care and mobility will be much greater than any requirement for supervision. People in the terminal phases of the illness will be receivi ng a high degree of assistance from others on a 24 -hour basis. Some people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which has been diagnosed early, and in whom the initial progression is slow, may have few functional restrictions at first, especially if only on e hand or foot is affected. They may be able to care for themselves and walk a reasonable distance for between 1 to 3 years before functional restrictions become generalised. People with the less common variants of motor neurone disease that are known to h ave a long prognosis may have few functional restrictions for many years. How long will the needs last? In the commonest types of motor neurone disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or progressive bulbar palsy) the disease advances relentlessly and the ou tlook is very poor. Severe functional restrictions develop quickly over a relatively short period of time. The prognosis is worse for people who present with progressive bulbar symptoms, usually less than 2 years. People with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis survive 2 - 5 years from onset of symptoms. However since diagnosis may be delayed average survival from the time of diagnosis is only 14 months. People developing the condition at a younger age i.e. less than 50 years, tend to survive longer, as do peopl e with progressive muscle atrophy. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

Treatment and recovery for those who successfully undergo this treatment is likely to take 18 months to 2 years. During this period they are likely to have periods of being immunosuppressed and be unable to g o out in public. Episodes of severe fatigue may endure for many months related to chemotherapy treatment and anaemia. Some will be unwell and have care or mobility needs for about 3 months only - during the transplant and transplant recovery period. Othe rs will develop needs related to chemotherapy side effects during their first course of chemotherapy, if this happens needs are likely to last through the first course and into the transplant period. Recovery from the transplant is likely to be more prolon ged in this group and may take a year from completion of treatment. The main cause of needs is likely to be severe chemotherapy related fatigue. About a third of people in this group will not respond to treatment well enough to progress to a PBSCT or bon e marrow transplant - this group is also likely to develop needs both related to treatment side effects and the disease itself. Some may be terminally ill and have any of the symptoms in the relapsed group above. These cases are likely to apply under speci al rules. Back to top of section People over 65 and people of working age who are 'unfit' This group may have any of the symptoms of myeloma, bone pain is especially common. Pain in the back or legs may affect mobility and or ability to bend. Fatigue is likely to be most severe in those with severe anaemia, immunosuppression, heart failure or renal failure. During the first 6 months of chemotherapy treatment about half will feel much better and go into remission. There are likely to be mild side effects of chemotherapy. Remission is likely to last for 18 -24 months, beyond which point symptoms will recur and further treatment will be required. Those that do not respond to initial treatment are likely to have other treatments which m ay or may not be effective. Of this group as a whole about 55% will still be alive after one year. Relapsed or recurrent myeloma Mobility These people are often quite disabled by bone pain, renal failure and drug side effects. Severe fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance related to any of the following may reduce the ability to walk -: Chemotherapy treatment Anaemia Renal failure Skeletal pain Fractures Peripheral neuropathy affecting the feet (drug side effect) People who are immunosuppressed may be advised to avoid public places and public transport. People with myeloma are likely to have bone pain which may be severe. If the site of pain is the back or the legs mobility may be restricted to a few yards or they may be unable to walk at all. I f high doses of pain killers are required to control pain, dizziness and drowsiness associated with these may reduce mobility even if pain is well controlled. Those with spinal cord compression may be unable to walk at all. Care Severe fatigue may make activities of daily living difficult. Back pain may limit the ability to bend. Heavy lifting should be avoided because of the possible risk of fracture. Painful myeloma deposits in the upper limbs may reduce the ability to prepare food and self care. Activities such as climbing into the bath or shower and washing may require assistance from someone else because of pain, fatigue or dizziness. Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) There are no disabling effects associated with this c ondition. Isolated Plasmacytoma of Bone Radiotherapy treatment almost always successfully puts this disease into remission; however pain may persist after treatment even when disease is in remission. Typically treatment takes 4 -6 weeks; recovery from treat ment is expected within about 3 months. Myeloma commonly develops about 2 - 5 years after successful treatment. 1 in 10 will require further local treatment for recurrent disease at the site of their original tumour, no residual disability is expected. Solit ary extramedullary plasmacytoma Radiotherapy almost always relieves the pain associated with this condition, no residual disability is expected. Typically treatment takes 4 -6 weeks, complete recovery from symptoms and treatment is expected within about 3 m onths. Cure rates are good with 10 year survival of 70%. In the 10 years after treatment about 1 in 5 will develop multiple myeloma. A small group of people who had a large tumour at diagnosis and who required surgery or chemotherapy in addition to radioth erapy treatment may develop needs during treatment related to treatment side effects. They are unlikely to have ongoing needs after recovery. Back to top of section How long will needs last? First line treatment People of workin g age and older 'fit' people The group who have the PBSCT or bone marrow transplant have the best long term outcome. A return to health is expected in the typical case, time limited awards are recommended, recovery should be substantially complete 1 year a fter PBSCT or bone marrow transplant. However recurrence of disease is common, if disease has recurred renewal with indefinite award is recommended. Indefinite awards are recommended for those unable to have this treatment. People over 65 and people of w orking age who are 'unfit' Of this group 55% will still be alive after one year. Those who respond to chemotherapy and go into remission are likely to be in the survivor group. Those who do not respond to treatment are more likely to be terminally ill. This group are likely to have some symptoms and may have identifiable needs, time limited awards are recommended with review at 12 -18 months. Those who will recover are likely to be well at this stage. For those in this group who relapse after a period of re mission refer to the relapsed or recurrent myeloma section. Relapsed or recurrent myeloma Needs are likely to be identified in this group, disability is most likely to relate to bone pain, renal failure and drug side effects such as fatigue and neuropathy . Many will be terminally ill; this is particularly likely if relapse has happened within 6 months of first line treatment. If needs are identified life awards are recommended. Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) There are no disabli ng effects associated with this condition. Isolated Plasmacytoma of Bone In the rare case where needs are identified during treatment awards should be time limited to coincide with completion of treatment and recovery - 6-9 months if chemotherapy is being used. If myeloma develops after successful treatment of this condition needs are likely to arise related to myeloma symptoms and treatment. Solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma Treatment and recovery are complete within three months, enduring needs are no t expected. If myeloma develops after successful treatment refer to the myeloma information. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Over 65 People over 65 have a much worse outlook than people of working age because they are often not fit enough to have intensive treatment. Before chemotherapy treatment median survival from diagnosis was about 7 months. Median survival with chemotherapy treatment varies from 29 -62 months, depending on stage. The overall outlook of everyone with myeloma including the young people who do better is a 1 year survival rate of 55% and a 10 year survival rate of 3% -12%.

Linked pages: Ageing Falls Frailty What evidence is available? Note: If considering entitlement to H/R Mobility component under the Severely Visually Impaired (SVI) provisions, the following evide nce source must be used: The Consultant Ophthalmologist will be able to provide information about symptoms, signs, invest igations including assessment of vision, treatment/management, and is likely to have information about resulting disability or needs. Other evidence sources Generally those patients with significant problems arising from their MS will be under the regular care of a hospital; either a neurologist or rehabilitation specialist. In addition they may be provided with specialist services such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and sometimes speech therapy. Appointments are commonly eve ry six months or once a year. Because of the range of severity and frequency of symptoms, it is not possible to infer from just the diagnosis the care and mobility needs of any individual without specific information. Health care professionals involved with the care patients who have significant problems may be better placed than GPs to provide helpful information particularly where the mobility and care needs are not clear. These health care professionals include -: Consultant Neurologist Specialist Nurse Occupational therapist & Physiotherapist Day centre leader General Practitioner Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs The amount of care and mobility requirements of someone with MS will vary from person to person. Variability in symptoms must be taken into account. Some people with only a short history but rapidly progressive form of the disease may require much more support than someone with a very slowly progressive form that they have had for over twenty years. Patients particularly with 'Benign' MS may well live a n active, 'normal' life, including a full working life. The most common symptoms of multiple sclerosis are weakness in one or more limbs, spasticity (muscle rigidity or pronounced stiffness) and spasms, especially in the legs, numbness and loss of sensati on, pain, unsteadiness of gait, poor vision, fatigue and difficulties with speech and swallowing. In the upper limbs, tremor, sufficient to interfere with everyday activities may develop. As the condition progresses movements may become shaky, irregular and ineffective. Muscle weakness and spasticity may interfere with walking, sometimes eventually making it impossible while unsteadiness may lead to falls. Difficulty with bladder control is very common and urinary symptoms are experienced by most people at some point. Bladder problems can affect the person's family, social life and work responsibilities. They include an urgent need to empty the bladder, having to use the toilet frequently, urinary tract infections and incontinence. Occasionally people are unable to empty their bladder without using a catheter. Bowel problems include constipation, bowel urgency sometimes due to lack of sensation and faecal incontinence. Impaired vision and weakness or tremor in the upper limbs may make the use of walking aids difficult or impossible and muscle fatigue, particularly when walking, may require the person to stop and rest at frequent intervals. Speech may become slow, slurred and hesitant and in the late stages of the disorder, dementia and mania (excessive e lation) may also develop. Therefore advanced stages of the disease lead to pronounced sensory and motor impairment and can be accompanied by significant cognitive and emotional problems. Short term memory often becomes impaired with poor attention and con centration and there may be depression or exaggerated emotional responses. H/R Mobility Severely Visually Impaired (SVI) deeming provision Back to top of section How long will the needs last? The course of multiple sclerosis is highly varied and unpredictable. In most patients, most commonly when multiple sclerosis begins with optic neuritis, remissions can last from a few months to over 10 years. Multiple sclerosis is not a fatal disease although in severe cases may pose a risk because of life -threatening complications. It also shortens the average life span by about six years and in nearly all cases, the negative emotional impact of this disease and its symptoms is considerable. Women ten d to have a better outlook than men although the severity of the disease varies widely from patient to patient: About 10% to 35% of patients have a very mild form of the disease, with little if any disability, no need for medication and a normal life exp ectancy. People who have only optic neuritis and symptoms that affect the senses have a better outlook than if symptoms are more widespread. About 70% of patients will experience some degree of progression. MS, however, can sometimes remain asymptomatic or become only mildly symptomatic ('Benign' MS). Generally where relapses become more frequent, people become increasingly disabled, sometimes permanently. Nonetheless, about 75% of people who have multiple sclerosis never need a wheelchair and for about 40% normal activities are not disrupted. Life expectancy is shortened only slightly with MS and the average survival of patients from the time of diagnosis is over 30 years. The survival rate is linked to disability and secondary complications such as kidney or chest problems or psychiatric disorders. Remissions of varying length are common, particularly in the early years of the disease; they can last for months or years and in some instances appear to be life long. However, the primary progressive fo rm of the disease can take a rapid downhill course. The most common pattern is recurring relapses leading to chronic disability with associated complications and eventually some degree of dependency and impaired mobility. Customers with relapsing and rem itting type are likely to have periods of greater disability. When considering duration of awards for them all facts must be taken into consideration including the duration of any previous relapses when advising on duration of award. Customers diagnosed with primary or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis are likely to have ongoing needs once needs are established and indefinite awards are recommended. Seek advice from the medical services if in any doubt. You may need to consider whether H/R Mob SVI deeming provisions are satisfied - H/R Mobility SVI. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disablin g effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

Read more about effects in the over 65 age group What evidence is available? The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis is invariably confirmed in the hospital setting, because of the nature of the specialist neurological investigations required. Recently diagnosed people will remain under hospital care for some months or longer, while drug treatment is initiated and monitored. Medical reports may be obtained from neurologists and specialist neurological nurses. Elderly people with myasthenia gravis may be under the care of geriatricians. Additional information may be available from occupational therapists , community nurses or social services that provide assessments and care in the home. General practitioners can provide information about people with myasthenia gravis who are stable on medication and who visit the hospital clinic infrequently. In some cases an HCP Examination report may be helpful, if there is no up to date information regarding the disabling effects of the condition and its response to treatment. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs The majority of people with myasthenia gravis are able to pursue a normal life once the diagnosis is made and drug treatment has been stabilised. Thymectomy is a major operation, b ut people having this surgery can be expected to have made a good postoperative recovery within 2 to 3 months. Mild functional restriction People in the following categories are likely to have no functional restrictions or mild restrictions only: - those in remission, with ocular symptoms only, with symptoms well controlled on medication (anticholinesterases drugs +/- stable regime of immunosuppressant drugs) under care of GP only or visit the hospital clinic infrequently. They are unlikely to have a r equirement for help with self -care or to be restricted in their ability to walk. Ocular problems are unlikely to cause significant visual impairment necessitating help in finding the way out of doors. Moderate functional restriction People in the following categories may have moderate functional restrictions: - recently diagnosed whose treatment regime is still being stabilised recovering from recent thymectomy attending hospital clinic on a regular basis for monitoring and modification of drug regimes, or having plasmapharesis ((plasma exchange) or immunoglobulin injection They may need some help with self -care and preparation of food. It is important to take into account the variability of symptoms during day, and the effects of fatigability. Although peo ple with moderate functional restrictions are able to carry out a task initially, they may have difficulty in repeating or sustaining the activity. Self -care activities may take longer to complete than normal, especially as the day progresses. Severe funct ional restriction People in the following categories may have severe functional restrictions: - rapidly progressive disease not responding to standard drug treatments, recent hospital admission for deteriorating symptoms, need for artificial ventilation , long standing generalised disease, presence of muscle wasting. People may have difficulty in dressing, washing, standing for prolonged periods, bending down, rising from a chair, using the toilet, climbing stairs and in moving around the house. They may need help in taking frequent doses of medication if manual dexterity is impaired. Walking may be restricted due to weakness of the lower limbs exacerbated, in some cases, by shortness of breath. People may use wheelchairs out of doors and in the h ome. Some people with severe lower limb weakness may be prone to falls. It is unlikely that people with severe myasthenia gravis would require constant watching over to prevent a cholinergic or myasthenic crisis, since the onset is usually gradual over so me hours. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Prior to the development of successful treatments for myasthenia gravis 25% to 30 % died within 3 years of onset. Now the majority of people (up to 90%) are likel y to be able to lead a normal life without undue restrictions. Life expectancy is considered to be close to normal. Complete remission is rare, but up to 20% of cases go into remission, and the disease does not reappear for some years. However for people whose disease does not remit, the need for drug treatment is life long. Standard drug treatments provide good relief of symptoms, and people are able to carry out many normal daily tasks in the absence of disabling muscle weakness, Thymectomy improves the prognosis and its benefits in improving symptoms may continue for months or up to several years after the operation. A poor prognosis is more likely when onset of myasthenia occurs after the age of forty years, when disease progression is rapid and if a thymoma is present. Early mortality occurs in the first three years; after that the disease tends to stabilise. Impairment Date of Onset Award Period Myasthenia gravis Less than 3 years More than 3 years 3 year award Indefinite award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Over 65 Elderly people are more likely to have difficulty in dressing, washing, standing for prolonged periods, bending down, rising from a chair, using the toilet, climbing stairs and in moving around. Help may be required with self-care and preparation of food including providing pur\u00e9ed foods for those with swallowing difficulties. Some elderly people may have restricted walking ability and use a wheelchair. Elderly people may need assistance with medication, especially if the dose and frequency of administration of tablets requires adjustment to obta in optimal effect and reduce troublesome side effects. Some people with more severe muscle weakness of the legs may be at risk of falling.

Other low grade lymphomas have varying outcomes. These different types and their features are listed and should be referred to when reviewing care and mobility needs. First line treatments early disease There are unlikely to be disabling effe cts of disease. Treatment usually consists of a short course of radiotherapy over 4 weeks. A return to health for a prolonged period is expected in the typical case. Long term survival of 10 years without relapsed disease is good at 80%. Those with relapse d disease will go on to have further treatment. First line treatment for advanced disease (stage II, III, IV) or Relapsed disease (second line, third line treatment etc.) The commonest treatment likely to be given is combination chemotherapy. This is an arduous treatment and needs related to side effects may be identified. Time limited awards of one year are recommended. Mobility Severe fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance related to any of the following may reduce the ability to walk -: Chemotherapy tr eatment e.g. peripheral neuropathy affecting the feet Anaemia Disease effects e.g. lung involvement causing breathlessness People who are immunosuppressed may be advised to avoid crowded public places. Care Severe fatigue may make activities of daily livi ng difficult. Help with activities of daily living from someone else may be required because of pain, fatigue or dizziness. High grade Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma The commonest type of high grade lymphoma is Diffuse large cell lymphoma and the care and mobility n eeds refer to this type of lymphoma. Other high grade lymphomas have varying outcomes. These different types and their features are listed and should be referred to when reviewing the Care and Mobility needs. High grade Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma First line trea tment for advanced disease (stage II, III, IV) or Relapsed disease (second line, third line treatment etc) First line treatment and recovery for those who successfully undergo combination chemotherapy is likely to take 6 months to a year. People with re lapsed disease will have salvage chemotherapy. If they respond to this they will go on to have high dose chemotherapy and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant (PBSCT) or bone marrow transplant. Non responders will usually live less than 6 months. For thos e who undergo bone marrow or stem cell transplant the treatment and recovery period is likely to take 12 months occasionally upto18 months. During recovery from transplant they are likely to have periods of being immunosuppressed and be advised to avoid crowded or enclosed public places e.g. public transport at busy times and people who are unwell. Episodes of severe fatigue may endure for many months related to chemotherapy treatment and anaemia. Some will be unwell and have care or mobility needs for about 3 months - during the transplant and transplant recovery period. Some will be unwell for much longer. The main cause of ongoing needs in both groups is likely to be severe chemotherapy related fatigue. If high dose chemotherapy and transplant has already been used then other types of chemotherapy may be given to control disease and symptoms, in this case ongoing needs may relate to symptoms of disease as well as treatment. Mobility Severe fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance related to any of the following may reduce the ability to walk -: Chemotherapy treatment e.g. peripheral neuropathy affecting the feet Anaemia Disease effects e.g. lung involvement causing breathlessness People who are immunosuppressed may be advised to avoid crowded public places. Care Severe fatigue may make activities of daily living difficult. Help with activities of daily living from someone else may be required because of pain, fatigue or breathlessness. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Treatments effectively control disease in 60 -80% of people although it does relapse eventually. The median time to recurrence is 3 -4 years. Refer to table of types of lymphoma for information on outcome for less common types of ly mphoma. Treatments are arduous especially bone marrow or stem cell transplant, treatment and recovery may take 12 -18 months. Combination chemotherapy treatments may also be arduous therefore time limited awards of 1 year are recommended if needs are ident ified. In people under the age of 60 five year recurrence -free survival is approximately 60% and in people over the age of 60 recurrence -free survival rates drop to 50%. A return to health is expected in the typical case. People whose disease relapses a s econd or third time do less well and are generally incurable; this group may collect enduring disabling problems related to the disease or its treatment. In this group long term or life awards are more appropriate - some may be terminally ill. Refer to the lymphoma tables for information on less common types of lymphoma. High grade Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma First line treatment for early disease A return to health is expected in the typical case. 5 year survival is as high as 70%. There are unlikely to be any l ong term care and mobility needs after treatment. The exception to this are the enduring but rare side effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In the rare situation where an award is appropriate during treatment with chemotherapy, the award should last fo r the duration of treatment and then be reviewed. Any needs arising from these are likely to be long term and life awards are recommended. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of d isabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

However, independent and accurate evidence may be needed especially if co-morbidities are claimed. More detailed information would be provided by a GPFR . An accurate Body Mass Index (BMI) value would be needed as well as a record of what co -morbidities are present. If the person is morbidly obese and has multidisciplinary care, including obesity clinic attendance, specialist surveillance with a view to further treatment such as bariatric surgery may be required. If the person has had bariatric surgery a hospital factual report may be required. In some situations, interpretation of information, results or reports may be needed and Medical Services would be able to help in this regard. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs The risk of suffering disabling effects of obesity depends on many factors. Obesity is likely to worsen the disabling effects of impairments such as osteoarthritis and is chaemic heart disease. A BMI of 55 to 60 is usually the cut -off point where it will be expected that a person with that BMI is likely to suffer disabling effects. The disabling effects of obesity itself (without co - morbidities) are considered below. Mild Functional Restriction (BMI = 35 to 45) Category Description Disabling Effects In a typical person with a BMI of 35 to 45 there are normally no functional restrictions, which are significant enough to lead to care or mobility needs. Mobility A person with a mild functional restriction would normally be able to walk several hundred metres at a normal or slightly slower pace without assistance. He/she would normally be able to get around in an unfamiliar place without assistance. ADL A person with a mild functional restriction would normally be able to cope with all activities of self -care such as getting in or out of a bed or chair unaided, getting on & off the toilet, washing bathing and dressing him/herself and preparing and cooking a meal. He/she should be able to bend to get food in or out of an oven and self- medicate. He/she would still normally be able to climb stairs unaided, though he/she may be somewhat breathless having reached the top. There would be n o supervisory needs. Moderate Functional Restriction (BMI > 45 to < than 55) Category Description Disabling Effects In a typical person with a BMI of more than 45 to less than 55, though they would be likely to have some limitations, there are usually no functional restrictions, which are significant enough to lead to care or mobility needs. Mobility A person with a moderate functional restriction would normally be able to walk at least 200 to 300 metres at a slightly slower pace without assistance. He/she would normally be able to get around in an unfamiliar place without assistance. ADL A person with a moderate functional restriction would normally be able to cope with all activities of self -care such as getting in or out of a bed or chair unaided, getting on & off the toilet, washing bathing and dressing him/ herself, and preparing and cooking a meal, but may have some difficulty. He/she should normally still be able to bend to get food in or out of an oven, and self- medicate . He/she would still normally be able to climb stairs unaided, though he/she may have to stop on the way up and may be breathless having reached the top. There would normally be no supervisory needs. Severe Functional Restriction (BMI = 55 and over) Category Description Disabling Effects A person with a severe functional restriction would have a BMI of 55 or over and may have one or more of the following as a result of their obesity -: Breathlessness on minimal exertion. Heart failure, leading to greatly reduced exercise tolerance. Hypoventilation leading to accumulation of toxic levels of CO2 in the blood and the requirement for supplementary oxygen. Severe sleep apnoea with daytime sleepiness and loss of mental clarity. Reduced mobility. Reduced manual dexterity (due to obese hands). Mobility Because of breathlessness and heart failure, a person with a severe functional restriction would normally not be likely to be able to walk more than 30 metres at a slow pace. If a person is very severely obese, he/she may be able to walk only a few steps or not at all. ADL A person with a severe functional restriction may need assistance with most aspects of self -care such as getting in and out of bed or out of a chair, getting on and off th e toilet, cleaning him/herself after the toilet and other aspects of personal hygiene and bathing or showering. He/she may not be able to get about unaided in or out of doors. Preparation of a meal may not be possible because of reduced manual dexterity a nd he/she may not be able to safely manage hot pans and would be unlikely to be able to bend to an oven. He/she would normally be able to take medication safely but if mental clarity is affected (in very rare cases) the person may need assistance. He/she may not be able to manage stairs without assistance. At night, he/she may suffer from sleep apnoea and may need help with CPAP or oxygen, changing position in bed and to get comfortable. He/she may need help in getting out of bed in the night and on and o ff the toilet. He/she would not normally require supervision for any aspect of daily living or for finding his/her way about in an unfamiliar place. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? There are many complex factors that influence weight loss in the individual including genetic, environmental and behavioural influences. Each person would respond slightly differently to a weight loss programme because of his/her unique physiological makeup. There are t hree main elements, which may be used in a weight loss programme -: Diet. Exercise. Medication. In reality, surgical options are not used so frequently on the NHS. It is a fundamental fact that any changes to lifestyle (with the aim of losing weight), especially in diet and exercise must be lifelong to make a lasting difference. If the changes are short -term, the weight will almost certainly go back on again. The changes must be manageable such as moderate exercise and a diet which is varied and enjoyab le, otherwise the person will not persist in the changes. Many experts believe that yo -yo dieting, as it is called, encourages the deposition of abdominal fat with the associated complications and prognosis may be worse in these individuals than if they had not lost weight at all. The longer a person remains overweight, the less likelihood there is of the person losing weight, unless there are very strong motivating factors. Other factors may not make it completely possible, such as the taking of perman ent steroid medication. Generally speaking, if a person has been obese for 5 years it is likely that they will remain so. Impairment Duration of needs Award Period Obesity - BMI 55+ Less than 5 years More than 5 years 2 year award Indefinite award Awaiting or recently undergone surgery 2 year award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claiman t. Back to top of section Obesity in people over 65 There is a natural tendency for people to put weight on as they get older, part of the reason being that they are less active. Around 1 in 4 people over the age of 50 are conside red obese. Body mass index is not a useful means of measuring obesity in the elderly. Waist circumference instead should be measured. In elderly individuals with excessive intra -abdominal fat (visceral obesity) and sarcopenia (where there is loss of muscl e mass), there is the greatest risk of excess morbidity and mortality. Reference: (Principles and Practice of Geriatric Medicine.... Pathy, Sinclair, Morley) The risk of Vascular and Alzheimer's dementia is increased in obese elderly people because of the related complications of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes compounding increased susceptibility. Persisting ageist attitudes to the elderly include the acceptance that they are more likely to have a poor diet and that they are not expected to exercise. Co nsequently, they may not be encouraged to change these important aspects of their lifestyle. The findings of a study (Korea, 2002) were that elderly obese patients were worse off (health -wise) than obese younger patients and non -obese older patients.

Read more about effects in the over 65 age group What evidence is available? Self-assessment is the prime source of evidence, but the claim pa ck should be checked to see who has completed it. If the form has been filled in by the customer, due to the nature of their condition, it might not necessarily be an accurate or reliable description of their problems. If the claim pack has been completed on behalf of the customer, by someone who has a good understanding of his or her needs, then it could provide good evidence. The DM should bear in mind that the completion of the corroborative statement by a mental health professional does not necessaril y mean that they endorse what has been said in the claim pack. Note: In cases of moderate and severe OCD it is highly probable that a consultant psychiatrist will have been involved in the management and treatment of the individual. Indeed the absence of any documented history of a psychiatric consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if required. A HCP Ex amination Report may be helpful if t he person has physical problems. Other sources of information include the following: Care co -ordinator When the customer is being supported by a community mental health team the care co -ordinator on that team will be th e preferred source of further evidence. They have lead responsibility for the delivery of the care plan and so they can give details of the support that the customer has been assessed as needing. They will also know whether the customer is being helped b y an Assertive Outreach or Crisis Resolution team. Community Mental Health Team The community mental health team provides a multidisciplinary team approach. The team will include psychiatrists, community psychiatric nurses, occu pational therapists and social workers working in close collaboration with social service departments. One member of the team may co -ordinate the care and is known as the Care Co -ordinator. Community Psychiatric Nurse (CPN) A customer may be in regular contact with a CPN who will have assessed their care requirements. Advice is given about the amount of psychiatric nursing required and the administration of drugs. The CPN will be in contact wi th other mental health professionals. They are well placed to provide detailed evidence about the customer's needs. NHS Care Programme Approach (CPA) care plan When the customer is in contact with mental health services there will be a care plan under the NHS Care Programme Approach. The care plan will include information on health and social care as well as domestic support and is reviewed regularly. The customer is given their own copy, which could be requested, as it will contain useful evidence of need s. Social Services care plan Social Services departments may be approached for help by someone with mental health problems. A community care assessment by a social worker/care manager will be arranged and a care plan produc ed. The care plan will include details of the customer's day -to-day living and the support provided. A copy can be obtained from the customer. Mental Health Social Worker Where a mental health social worker has been appointed to support a customer they will have information about the customer's ability to cope with everyday living. Subject to consent to approach them being given, the mental health social worker will be able to provide some useful evidence about the customer's needs. Day Centre and Psychiatric Day Hospital Attendance at a day centre (not on hospital site) or psychiatric day hospital (on hospital site) is likely to indicate severe disability. These are therapeuti c environments for evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of patients with mental health problems. They are staffed by psychiatric nurses, and there is input from all other members of the community mental health team. Attendance presents an alternative for patients whose condition requires intensive treatment, but do not need to be hospitalised. Accommodation manager When the customer is living in supported accommodation then the type and level of support provided could be helpful in determining their need fo r help. A phone call to the accommodation manager could provide useful evidence. Crisis Resolution Team The customer may have been supported during a crisis by the Crisis Resolution Team. The teams are mainly comprised of CPNs, who would make urgent visits, day or night to anyone who is thought to be in need of hospitalisation. The idea is to provide intensive treatment at home instead. The Crisis Resolution Team would be well placed to provide details of the customer's cond ition. General practitioner factual report If there is no specialist mental health professional involvement or evidence cannot be obtained from them, then it may be necessary to request a factual report from the customer's own doctor. The G.P may have only limited knowledge of customer's mental health problems, even when there is no one else involved. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Obsessions and compulsion s are distressing, time consuming and have a negative impact on the person's interpersonal relationships and career. Social isolation may occur in people with more severe OCD, partly because they spend most of their day performing rituals and partly becau se others regard their behaviour as peculiar. Obsessional thoughts interfere with concentration on study and work. Two thirds of people report lowered career aspiration. 47% experienced work interference and 40% were unable to work for an average of 2 years. Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling effects People with a mild functional restriction are likely to: Be managed by the primary health care team Have never received treatment or received treatment with low intensity Cognitiv e Behavioural Therapy (CBT) (including Exposure and Response Prevention ERP) or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI). Alone if unable to engage in low intensity CBT. Live independently Enjoy contact with friends and family Have no loss of interests or hobbies Be able to leave the house unaccompanied Mobility They would normally have no physical difficulty in getting around. They should not have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and should not require guidance or supe rvision. Care They should not normally exhibit significant self -neglect. They should not normally have any significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day -to-day activities. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling effects People with a moderate functional restriction are likely to: Be managed by either primary or secondary health care teams Have received more intensive CBT (including ERP) or SSRI alone Live independently Have reduced social interaction with friends and family Have a reduction in interests and hobbies Be unable to complete an unfamiliar journey without a companion Mobility They would normally have no physical difficulty in getting around. They may have such severe obsessions and compulsions (for example, of contamination or fear of harm to self) that they are unable to leave the house or complete an unfamiliar journey without a companion for reassurance. Should the companion not be present the person may not be able to reach their destination. Care They may spend so much time performing rituals or have compulsive slowness to a degree that this may result in a loss of their ability to carry out normal day -to-day activities and may lead to self neglect Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling effects People with a severe functional restriction are likely to: Have received previous treatment with drugs and CBT to little or no effect and are most likely to have been referred to more intensive specialist treatment services. Mobility They would normally have no physical difficulty in getting around. Some patients particularly with obsessions concerning perfectionism, have the urge to perform every action \"correctly\" and can be extremely slow in speech and in movement and can thus appear to have severe learning difficulties and mobility problems. They may have such severe obsessions and compulsions (for example of contamination or fear of harm to self) that they are unable to leave the house or complete an unfamiliar journey without a companion for reassurance. They may be so occupied by obsessional thoughts that their awareness is affected and may not be aware of common dangers, such as traffic. Care They may spend so much time performing rituals or have compulsive slowness to a degree that this is likely to result in a loss of their ability to carry out normal day -to-day activities and may lead to self neglect. Some individuals restrict fluid intake and may seriously harm their kidney function and physical health. Urinary or faecal incontinence can occur in patients who become \"stuck\" in their compulsive rituals and unable to attend to this aspect of self - care. Alternatively, they may be so occupied by ob sessional thoughts that their awareness is affected, and may not be aware of common dangers, for example, leaving gas taps on. People with this level of disability will normally be considered for more intensive treatments, hospital admission or supported accommodation. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) may follow an acute, episodic, chronic unremitting, deteriorating or relapsing course. For some people the symptom type will remain unchanged, but for others the symptoms change over time. Intermittent, episodic disorder is more common in the early stages of the disorder whereas chronic illness is more common in the later stages. The response to treatment is usually good. For example, Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) has response rates of up to 85% in people who complete the treatment, but this may take several months. The response to drug treatment increases gradually over weeks and months and the benefits continue to accrue for at least six months and have been shown for up to 2 years. Resistant cases that require different types of treatment may take a year or more to achieve functional improvement. A recent study of people with severe OCD showed that 6 to 8 year s after treatment, approximately: 27% no longer met the criteria for the diagnosis of OCD (i.e. were effectively \"cured\") 17% had mild symptoms 34% had moderate symptoms 24% had severe symptoms Worse outcome was associated with longer duration of illness before treatment. Therefore for people who are undergoing treatment, a short term award of 2 years is recommended, in order to give time to assess the response to treatment. For people who have received treatment but have responded poorly, a longer term award of 10 years is recommended, as it is possible that further treatments may be instituted in the future. Impairment Duration of needs Award Period Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Currently undergoing treatment Poor response to previous treatment 2 year award 10 year award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Over 65 Obse ssive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) may occasionally occur for the first time in old age. In addition, OCD frequently persists into old age. Clinical features and severity are similar to younger people with OCD. However, older people are more likely to have ob sessions relating to having sinned and compulsions to hand washing relative to younger people. Because depression and OCD commonly coexist, depression is more likely to be recognised in the elderly and treatment of OCD may be inadequate.

Symptoms of disease may include many of the following: difficulty swallowing - 'dysphagia' regurgitation of food or vomiting of food acid indigestion pain in the back or chest or on swallowing - 'odynophagia' hoarseness or coughing weight loss Over time they are likely to lose a huge amount of weight becoming very frail, they may be unable to walk more than a few steps or cope with shopping and cleaning. In the terminal phase they are likely to require help with all aspects of personal care. Between 30% and 60% will respond to chemotherapy in that their symptoms will be less troublesome for some weeks or months. Many will go on to have further treatments such as stenting to maintain swallowing. Weight lo ss and fatigue are likely to be significant problems even when swallowing can be maintained. Any of the symptoms of metastatic disease may also be present e.g. bone pain from bony metastases and liver metastases causing jaundice and increased fatigue. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Localised (early stage) oesophageal cancer Those who have had treatment for Barrett's oesophagus are expected to make a complete recovery and are unlikely to experience recurren t disease. Ongoing problems for them may include difficulty eating large meals and symptoms of dumping syndrome such as nausea, bloating, pain and diarrhoea. Those who have had treatment of Oesophageal cancer with major surgery are likely to be self carin g and mobile three months into recovery although full recovery is likely to take at least 1 year. If needs are identified during treatment these are likely to be much reduced at 3 months and in the typical case no needs would be anticipated at 1 year. The exception to this might be those who have developed enduring side effects of surgery. Ongoing problems for this group may include difficulty eating large meals and symptoms of dumping syndrome. Many patients remain underweight for a long time after surgery and will feel tired for a large part of the day. Those who have had chemoradiation treatment for localised Oesophageal cancer may have identifiable needs during treatment which lasts for 3 -4 months. It may take several months to recover from this treatme nt but needs are unlikely to persist unless the rare but enduring side effects of radiotherapy have developed. Some people who have had either type of treatment for Oesophageal cancer may have a prolonged recovery period after treatment. This condition is particularly difficult and slow to recover from because of the profound weight loss and malnutrition that having difficulty swallowing causes. In addition many will develop recurrent disease within 5 years of successful treatment. 5 year survival rates af ter surgery are at best 30% and for chemoradiation therapy also around 30%. If disease recurs, needs are likely to occur and information relating to the advanced/recurrent disease stage is appropriate. In cases where needs are identified during treatment of the primary tumour, awards should be time limited to cover the period of treatment and recovery. People affected are unlikely to regain their normal weight but a return to near normal function is expected in the typical case. If disease has recurred aft er successful treatment of any stage of oesophageal cancer, information relating to the advanced/recurrent disease stage is appropriate. Life awards are recommended even if palliative treatment has appeared to significantly help with symptoms. All informa tion must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

Hospice Hospice Specialists -: Palliative Care Physician Macmillan Nurse Clinical Nurse Specialist Social worker Physiotherapist Occupational Therapist Counsellor Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Treatment of primary disease that is not advanced Eating and Swallowing Speech Advanced or recurrent lip, mouth and oropharyngeal cancer ADL Mobility Psychological Problems Outpatient treatments for this condition are unlikely to take more than 3 months to complete. The m ain disabling effects of this condition are likely to arise from the enduring effects of treatment on function of the mouth, particularly surgery. Treatment of primary disease that is not advanced Minimal enduring disabling effects would be expected. Howe ver when a person has had major surgery to the mouth or lip there may be residual disabling effects. In these cases evidence of ongoing problems and needs should be available from the Head and Neck clinical nurse specialist or speech therapist. Such proble ms may include: Difficulties with speech Dribbling/difficulty eating Difficulty swallowing Disfigurement Mental health problems Eating and Swallowing If a large area around the mouth has been reconstructed especially using free flaps from the arm or leg f or example the new reconstructed area will be numb or 'insensate'. Numbness around the mouth has a major impact on function. Activities such as eating and drinking will be very difficult. If the area around the mouth is numb people are unable to recognise the presence of food in the mouth, and to manipulate it for an effective and safe swallow. If the tongue (all or part) has been removed and reconstructed, it will be difficult to prepare food into a bolus or ball for normal swallowing and also difficult to propel the bolus of food to the back of the throat. A delay in triggering the swallow reflex may also occur, and in some people there may a risk of aspirating or inhaling food into the airway. This is very common immediately after the operation but can be an enduring problem. Some people may be able to learn safer swallow techniques; for example, altering of their head posture during swallowing, to protect the airway. Others may need supervision when eating because of ongoing aspiration. Other problems with eating and drinking include diminished lip seal following surgical intervention. This results in the drooling of food and fluid from the mouth (made worse by the fact that the lower lip is likely to be numb). Pocketing of food in the cheek ar eas may also occur, and reduced range of movement of the tongue can make it extremely difficult to retrieve food and fluid from around the mouth using the tongue. If part of the hard palate has been removed, food and fluid may be ejected into the nasal cavity. Speech Communication may also be a major problem, depending on the extent of the surgery, the reconstruction, and the structures involved. Communication difficulties may arise as a result of the range and speed of tongue movement, degree of lip closur e and soft palate function. Patients who have had a dental clearance may have an even further reduced repertoire of sounds. This loss of ability to communicate can be devastating to head and neck cancer patients; resulting in frustration, social isolation and depression. Advanced or recurrent lip, mouth and oropharyngeal cancer This group are likely to have disabling effects from both the disease and its treatment, symptoms of disease may include: Ulceration in the mouth pain in the mouth that does not go away lump in the lip, mouth or throat pain on chewing or swallowing difficulty chewing or swallowing bleeding in the mouth numbness in the mouth loose teeth difficulty opening the mouth speech difficulty bad breath (halitosis) The following may be sympto ms of advanced disease: a lump in the neck loss of weight a large tumour may cause difficulty breathing They may in addition have any of the side effects of previous treatment, the most disabling of these include: Pain Dental caries - widespread and severe resulting in loss of teeth Osteonecrosis - literally means bone death, this may affect the upper or lower jaw, and the symptoms are pain, loose teeth or numbness. Trismus - inability to open the jaw, usually because of pain. This can also be caused by scarring and fibrosis of the muscles of mastication (chewing), causing restricted mobility of the lower jaw. This may be due to radiotherapy, surgery, or tumour invasion. Some people may require use of mechanical devices to stretch the ja ws, and this should be used frequently throughout the day (approximately seven 15 minute sessions per day). Some patients can only open their mouth a minimal amount (i.e. a few millimetres) and may be reliant on gastrostomy feeding or liquid diet. Oral hyg iene may also be a problem, and trismus can also impact on communication. Activities of Daily Living There may be ongoing problems with activities of daily living related to previous surgical treatment of disease, recent surgical treatment or advanced dise ase. These may include: Disfigurement Difficulty eating, including dribbling Difficulty swallowing Difficulty with speech They may need help cleaning and inserting and removing any prosthesis worn or mouth care. Dentures and obturators (a prosthesis that occludes the opening in the roof of the mouth) become coated in plaque and food debris, and can harbour infection. They must be cleaned frequently and meticulously using a soft brush and water. This must be done after every meal and when oral care is perfo rmed. Rinsing and soaking alone are not sufficient to remove plaque and debris effectively. Someone else will have to do this if there are any disabilities affecting hand movement or dexterity. Food preparation may be more onerous if a special diet is requ ired. Supervision to help with choking/aspirating food at meal times. General weakness because of weight loss. Shoulder dysfunction - loss of shoulder function because of damage to the accessory nerve is likely to have a significant impact on activities of daily living if both shoulders are affected. These will include washing and brushing the hair and dressing because of restricted movement of both upper limbs. Any activity involving raising the arms above shoulder level will be restricted. Typical activit ies affected would include hanging a coat up on a coat hook, reaching up to kitchen wall cupboards or high shelves. Changes in the ability to eat and drink in a socially acceptable fashion are a difficult issue. People who feel they are unable to eat in company because of such difficulties, may become socially isolated and stop going out at all. Head and neck cancer is very visible and the consequences of this can be devastating. Treatments for head and neck cancers can result in permanent, visible mutila tion which is difficult to disguise. People with such disabilities are likely to fear isolation and rejection, be concerned about the reactions of others and may become socially isolated, depressed and anxious. Mobility Mobility is not likely to be affecte d by this condition except where there is severe weight loss - general debility and fatigue may reduce mobility. Free flaps taken from the hip or lower leg do not have a long term effect on mobility although the donor site may be sore for a few months. Psychological Problems Mental health conditions such as depression can occur as a result of treatment of any type of cancer. Cancer of the mouth is especially challenging as it may involve disfigurement, difficulty eating and difficulty communicating. Social isolation is a common problem. Mental health conditions may cause additional needs and problems with activities of daily living. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Where needs are identified as a result of weak ness and malnutrition related to mouth cancer and its treatment and if the treatment is expected to be successful, time limited awards of 1 year are recommended. A return to normal function is expected in these cases. Life awards are recommended if needs are identified in people with advanced or recurrent disease. If needs are identified because of functional difficulties with the lips, mouth or throat following surgical treatment given more than 12 months previously life awards are also recommended. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

Over 65's The clinical features and treatment of Organic Brain Disorders in the elderly are similar to those in people under the age of 65. What evidence is available? The claimant and / or carer should be able to provide the information required to accurately assess mobility and care needs. However, if further details are needed, the Specialist Nurse , Occupational therapist or Consultant is an appropriate source of information. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a mild restriction are likely to have mild cognitive deficit. Mobility Physical walking ability is unlikely to be impeded in the absence of neuromuscular problems affecting the lower limbs. Impairment of cognitive function is not likely to be sufficient to cause difficulties satisfactorily using u nfamiliar routes independently. ADL The resulting disability is unlikely to affect their ability to independently carry out activities of daily living. They may be more at risk than a normal person of causing damage or injury in performing everyday activities due to forgetfulness. However this is usually not markedly above a person without early dementia. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a moderate restriction are likely to have moderate c ognitive deficit. Mobility Physical walking ability is unlikely to be impeded in the absence of neuromuscular problems affecting the lower limbs. Impairment of cognitive function is likely to be sufficient to cause difficulties satisfactorily using unfamiliar routes independently. ADL The resulting disability may lead them to require assistance with undertaking complex activities. They may require prompting or supervision to prepare food, take medication, deal with corresponden ce and financial matters and undertake appropriate activities. They are not likely to require assistance with most aspects of bodily function and they are not likely to require continual supervision to prevent potentially dangerous behaviours or activities . Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a severe restriction are likely to have severe cognitive deficit. Mobility Physical walking ability may be significantly restricted as a result of neuromuscular problems affecting the lower limbs. Impairment of cognitive function is likely to cause difficulties satisfactorily using unfamiliar routes independently. ADL The resulting disability is likely to lead them to require assistance with all act ivities of daily living. They are likely to require assistance with most aspects of bodily function and they are likely to require supervision to prevent potentially dangerous behaviours or activities.

Most organic brain disorders are usually irr eversible. Once care needs are established they are unlikely to improve and a life award should be considered. However, if there is progressive pathology, for example in dementia, further deterioration in cognitive function is likely, with consequential increase in care and mobility needs. Impairment Prognosis Award Period Delirium Delirium usually clears within a week but can last up to a month. It is associated with a high mortality. The prognosis depends upon successful treatment of the causative illness and the underlying state of the brain. 15% of the elderly do not survive. 40% are in institutional care at 6 months. N/A Dementia With some exceptions, dementia is an irreversibly declining condition. The time from onset to death varies according to the type of dementia. Indefinite award Alzheimer's disease On average, people spend several years in the mild or minimal stages (although it can be as long as 5 to 10 years), between 4 and 5 years in the moderate stages, and up to a year in the final stage. Vascular dementia Characteristically there is stepwise progression. The course varies but can be as severe and rapid as Alzheimer's disease despite treatment of the underlying cause. Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) Similar to Alzheimer's disease. In the later stages an akinetic -rigid syndrome can cause severe disability in mobility and swallowing and increase the number of falls. Fronto -temporal dementia (Pick's disease) The disease is progressive and the average time from onset to death is between 5 and 10 years. Prion diseases Both Variant Creutzfeldt -Jacob disease (vCJD) and Creutzfeldt - Jacob disease (CJD) have poor prognoses. The average time from onset to death is 14 mo nths for vCJD and 4 months for CJD. Huntington's disease Death is usually within 15 years of onset of Huntington's disease. Impairment Prognosis Date of Onset Award Period Head Injury -: Causing cognitive impairment For people with a minor head injury at 3 -month follow -up, 79% still have headache, 59% have symptomatic memory disturbance and 34% have not returned to work. For people with a moderate head injury 63% remain disabled at 1 year. For people with a severe head injury, 85% remain disabled at 1 year. The majority of physical recovery occurs in the first 12 months (mostly in the first 6 months) but psychological recovery can take up to 2 years and further small changes can take place over five years or more from the date of injury. Life expectancy of severely disabled survivors appears to be reduced by about 5 years. However, those who are very dependent may be at increased risk of respiratory complications, resulting in a decrease in life expectancy of 10 years. For people in veget ative state the mean survival rate is 3 - 4 years. For people with severe head injury follow up studies (2 to 10 years post injury) have demonstrated that the long term effects and rehabilitation needs are often extensive as detailed below. Less than 2 years More than 2 years 2 year award Indefinite award Causing sensori -motor impai rment Less than 2 years More than 2 years 2 year award Indefinite award Causing cognitive & sensori -motor impairment Independence - Approximately one half is ultimately able to live independently, one quarter live independently with support services and/or are in sheltered accommodation, one quarter are fully dependent upon the family or an institution. Occupation - Approximately two thirds are unemployed. Leisure and social life - Half report limited contact with friends. Sixty percent have no boyfriend or girlfriend. Many therefore remain dependent upon others, including family members for their leisure and social life. Marital relationships - One study of people with very severe head injury demonstrated that very few relationships remained intact at 10 - 15 year follow -up. Less than 2 years More than 2 years 2 year award Indefinite award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section CAPE (Clifton Assessment Procedures for the Elderly) test and scoring system CAPE assesses the severity of impairment in mental and behavioural functioning. It was originally devised for use in elderly, long -term psychiatric patients. The CAPE consists of two components, the Cognitive Assessment S cale (CAS) and the Behaviour Rating Scale (BRS). The CAPE is generally administered by nurses treating a patient and includes a 12 -item information and orientation subtest (taking the form of questions such as \"what is your date of birth?\"), a brief ment al abilities test (e.g. \"Will you count up from 1 to 20 for me - as quickly as you can?\") and a psychomotor performance test that involves tracing a line through a maze. The time taken for the psychomotor maze test and the number of errors on the other tes ts are converted into a CAS score out of 12. A cut -off point of 8 is recommended with scores of 7 or less generally indicating dementia or acute organic brain syndrome. The BRS contains 18 items and is completed by relatives or staff familiar with the patient's behaviour. It covers physical disability including performance of activities of daily living (ADL s), apathy, communication difficulties and social disturbance. BRS scores range from 0 to 36 with higher scores within this range indicating greate r disability. Scores on the two components are transferred onto a report form that summarises 'raw' scores in a five -category grading of the patient's level of dependency and hence, the support the patient is likely to require. CAPE grade CAPE grading description Grade A No mental impairment and no significant behavioural disability. Grade B Mild impairment in both areas requiring some support for people living in the community. Grade C Medium levels of impairment requiring considerable support for community living. Grade D Marked impairment and dependency. People in this category are usually institutionalised. Grade E Maximal impairment typical of psycho -geriatric patients requiring a great deal of nursing attention and care. The CAPE has been tested in several studies using large samples of patients. The results show good reliability and high sensitivity and specificity when used with psychiatric inpatients. It has been mainly tested on hospital populatio ns but its performance on 'community' samples remains unknown. The issue has been raised of how to score the CAPE when a patient cannot complete the maze test as a result of blindness or impairment of the hands e.g. by arthritis. The original approach of awarding 'zero' may lead to falsely classifying physical difficulties as a cognitive problem; pro - rating the score based on scores in other parts of the CAPE does not work well. Overall, the CAPE provides reliable estimates of cognitive and behavioural impairment for the institutionalised elderly population. As a screening test for 'community' use, the CAPE is considered probably to be less adequate than other available instruments such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).

Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs The overall level of functional restriction will depend upon the number of joints affected and the combin ation of upper and lower limb involvement. Please click on the appropriate link below to access the relevant care and mobility needs. Lower limb - Mild Functional Restriction Lower limb - Mode rate Functional Restriction Lower limb - Severe Functional Restriction Upper limb - Mild Functional Restriction Upper limb - Moderate Functional Restriction Upper limb - Severe Functional Restriction For ADL and Mobility details for OA Spine (without neurological signs) click on the link below -: Activities of Daily Living and Mobility consider ations - Mechanical back pain For ADL and Mobility details for OA Spine (with neurological signs) click on the link below -: Activities of Daily Living and Mobility considerations - Specific back pain Activities of Daily Living and Mobility considerations Lower limb - Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction would not normally have any noticeable disabilities on an everyday basis. There may be some pain and joint discomfort particularly after resting for any length of time, but this will quickly wear off. There may be some flare ups of the condition but these are likely to be infrequent and of short duration. Mobility A person with mild restr iction would normally have no physical difficulty in getting around nor would they require guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL A person with mild restriction would normally be able to safely manage all aspects of their personal care, including the abili ty to dress independently and put on socks and shoes, using simple technical aids if required. The ability to rise from sitting, attend to own toilet needs and prepare a main meal would not be impaired to any significant degree. Such a person would normall y be expected to care for themselves by maintaining personal hygiene and preparing meals etc. They would have little or no functional limitation on a day -to-day basis arising from any symptoms. No supervision or watching over needs would be present. Bear in mind that where there is also upper limb involvement, the combined effect of the functional restrictions may lead to greater mobility and care needs. Lower limb - Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction would normally experience persistent pain in one or more of their major joints or their feet. They are likely to have swelling of the joints (with the exception of the hip), and in some cases there will be deformit y of these joints. There may be some pain on weight bearing and knee instability (if the knee is affected) may also be present. Stiffness would normally be worse after resting for any length of time. Mobility A person with moderate restriction would norma lly have no physical difficulty getting around. Nor would they require guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL A person with moderate restriction may have difficulty getting out of bed, rising from the toilet and with dressing and washing. This is likely to be more apparent immediately after getting up in the morning, however these difficulties may be reduced by the use of prescribed assistive equipment, such as a raised toilet seat or grab rails. Knee instability could cause difficulty using stairs and may increase risk of falls; however the use of prescribed assistive equipment such as a stick or other mobility aids may help to reduce this. They would not need supervision or watching over. Bear in mind that where there is also upper limb involvement, t he combined effect of the functional restrictions may lead to greater mobility and care needs. Back to top of section Lower limb - Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction would normally have lower limb joint deformity in at least one joint and restriction of movement in that joint. They would also have pain on weight bearing and joint swelling (except for the hip). Joint pain may wake the person at night even with the use of painkillers. Where the knee is affected it is likely to be unstable and give way leading to falls. They may be on the waiting list for hip or knee replacement surgery. Mobility A person with severe restriction would norma lly need physical assistance from another person in getting around. The use of a walking aid may help prevent falls but it would not improve physical walking ability. T he person would not require guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL A person with severe restriction would normally have joint deformity with pain and restriction of movement. Knee instability is likely to be present and hence an increased risk of falls. However, the use of a stick may help reduce the risk of falls and may also assist i n rising after a fall. Such a person would normally need assistance from another person with dressing, bathing and attending to toilet needs. Help is likely to be needed with rising from sitting, getting out of bed, the bath and in using stairs. No supervi sion or watching over needs would be present. Bear in mind that where there is also upper limb involvement, the combined effect of the functional restrictions may lead to greater mobility and care needs. Upper limb - Mild Functional Restriction Catego ry Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction are unlikely to have any noticeable disabilities on an everyday basis. Pain, discomfort, joint swelling and/or stiffness will often be low grade or minimal, and normally wears off quite quickly. Although there may be exacerbations, these would be infrequent and not occur on a regular basis. They probably would not have any significant long-term care or mobility needs. Mobility A person with mild restriction wo uld normally have no physical difficulty in getting around nor would they need guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL A person with mild restriction would normally be able to dress independently, including managing buttons, and put on socks and shoes, using simple technical aids if required. The ability to rise from sitting, attend to own toilet needs and prepare a main meal would not be impaired to any significant degree. Such a person would normally be expected to care for themselves by maintai ning personal hygiene, preparing meals etc. have little or no functional limitation on a day to day basis arising from any symptoms. They would not need supervision or watching over. Bear in mind that where there is also lower limb involvement, the combined effect of the functional restrictions may lead to greater mobility and care needs. Upper limb - Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction may have swelling and deformity of their upper limb and hand joints. There may be some deformity of some of their joints together with some significant restriction of joint movement. There would normally be some restriction of manual dexterity when the hands a re involved. Stiffness would normally be worse after resting for any length of time. Where the neck is involved neck movements would normally be painful and restricted but without neurological signs, muscle wasting and weakness in the arms. Mobility A per son with moderate restriction would normally have no physical difficulty in getting around nor would they need guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL A person with moderate restriction could have difficulty coping with some activities of daily life. They w ould normally have no difficulty rising out of bed or chair (particularly if raised) but may have some difficulty getting out of a bath. Reduced manual dexterity could lead to problems with dressing, feeding, washing, shaving, toileting and aspects of mai n meal preparations such as lifting pans and peeling vegetables. Bear in mind that where there is also lower limb involvement, the combined effect of the functional restrictions may lead to greater mobility and care needs. Back to top of section Upper limb - Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction would normally have gross joint deformity of at least one joint and swelling (with the exception of the shoulder), together with pain and significant limitation of joint movement. The joints would be likely to be stiff after resting for any length of time, and morning stiffness may be present. In many cases the finger joints would be deforme d with swelling and pain leading to significant problems with manual dexterity. The joint pain may wake the person at night (even with the use of analgesics/painkillers). Where the neck is involved neck movements would normally be painful and restricted. Pins and needles, muscle wasting and weakness in the arms and very rarely in the legs may also occur. If the elbow is affected, a fixed flexion deformity may be present so that the person will be unable to straighten the arm fully. Rotational movements at t he elbow (supination/pronation) will also be reduced. Mobility A person with severe restriction may need physical assistance from another person in getting around due to difficulty in gripping and/or holding prescribed mobility aids. They would not need g uidance or supervision outdoors. ADL A person with severe restriction would normally have difficulty coping with many activities of daily life. They may have difficulties getting out of bed and getting out of a bath. Manual dexterity may be severely restricted if the finger joints are involved, leading to problems with dressing, feeding, washing, shaving, toileting and aspects of main meal preparations such as lifting pans and peeling vegetables. Due to the severity of this condition simple aids are unlike ly to be helpful and assistance may be needed in rising from a chair. Bear in mind that where there is also lower limb involvement, the combined effect of the functional restrictions may lead to greater mobility and care needs.

A consultant would offer hip or knee replacement surgery well in advance of this level of restricted mobility unless there is a contraindication or the person refuses surgery. If there is no consultant involvement and claimed needs are consistent with entitlement, the DM should investigate th e reasons for non referral to a consultant and whether there is a prospect of joint replacement surgery. If such reasons cannot be found, it must cast doubt on the situation and possibly Departmental Medical Services advice should be sought. +In cases wh ere there is another medical condition preventing surgery, the duration should be based on that condition or the reasons for refusal for treatment. If there is absolutely no prospect of joint replacement surgery then as OA is a degenerative progressive dis ease and surgery is the only way of improving function, an indefinite duration is appropriate. *Possible/potential joint surgery means joint surgery that has been discussed by the consultant with the customer and, which the customer has been advised will or is strongly expected to take place in the foreseeable short -term future (e.g. 6 -12 months). It does not mean surgery that the consultant has loosely alluded to the customer needing or may need at some, as yet undetermined point in the future. This dist inction must be established by the Decision Maker. It should be noted that generally, the outcome of joint replacement surgery in the lower limbs is very successful. Following surgery, rehabilitation and return to a reasonable level of activity can be expected within 2 months in the absence of complications. The elderly and frail and those with other significant medical problems ma y take longer to regain function but most should make a good recovery within 3 months even if the hip or knee replacement is bilateral. Toe surgery is usually fusion of the joint, 'fixing' it in the optimal position for function, which should make the joint pain free. Again, rehabilitation and return to a reasonable level of activity can be expected within 2 months in the absence of complic ations. Surgery for joint replacement in the upper limbs for OA is rare and the success more limited than for hips/knees but in the absence of complications better function should be obtained in 3 months. If surgery is planned but the exact date is not known a maximum award period of 2 years is suggested to take account of the national variation in waiting times and the anticipated rehabilitation period. If a date of surgery is known, or the customer has been on the waiting list for some months, a short er award period should be considered based on the individual circumstances of the case. *In AA cases, bear in mind that no 'Prospective Test' needs to be considered and also the length of the award period in relation to the following renewal claim. *Careful consideration should therefore be given as to whether the 'Prospective Test' is likely to be satisfied. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of award and the duration of award must be based on the particular circu mstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Generalised Osteo -arthritis in people over 65 The prevalence of Osteoarthritis increases with age. Clinical features are similar to those in a younger age group. Treatment is similar to that in a younger age group with some minor differences. For example, use of non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs should be avoided if possible in view of the increased susceptibility to gastrointestinal side effects and the benefit s of surgery must be weighed against the potential risks.

It may help to consult separate guidance on ageing, falls and frailty. Linked pa ges: Ageing Falls Frailty What evidence is available? The following may give sources of useful further evidence -: Hospital Factual Report for diagnosis, clinical findings and treatment General Practitioner for diagnosis, clinical findings and treatment Physiotherapist for functional assessment Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs From middle age onwards, bones gradually become less dense and are more liable to fracture. This is a normal part of the ageing process. Osteoporosis is a condition where this process of bone thinning is grea tly accelerated. Osteoporotic bones are brittle and are much more likely to fracture. The healing of osteoporotic fractures is not impaired, so any resultant disability may not last more than a few weeks or months. This is often the case in the younger pe rson. However in the elderly, who have sustained repeated fractures and progressive collapse of the spine, no significant improvement in disability is likely. Osteoporosis alone does not typically cause functional restrictions or problems with self - care or difficulty getting around. However, resulting fractures or vertebral collapse may have a significant impact to self - care or getting around. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs - Fractures The immediate effects of a fractured bone may cause significant functional restrictions. In many cases, such restrictions are unlikely to persist beyond three months. This period allows for the majority of fractures to heal (unite) and for general physical recovery to take place. In a minority of cases, t he fractured bones do not knit together (non -union) and recovery of function may be delayed. Surgery may be required to assist the healing process. Some fractures are complicated by infection. Established bony infection (Osteomyelitis) may be very difficul t to treat and result in longstanding disability. Such individuals may also be generally unwell. Delayed healing may also occur where the fractured bone has a single blood supply, such as the lower third of the tibia, and the neck of femur. In some cases a fracture may occur through a joint, damaging the joint structure. If possible, such fractures should be treated by operation. Secondary osteo -arthritis often complicates a fracture through a joint, and full recovery of function may not occur. In such cases, care and/or mobility needs may occur. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Osteoporosis is a progressive disease, which does not necessarily cause care or mobility needs. Functional restrictions are likel y to be due to fractures and the prognosis will depend on the healing of the fracture. If awarding on the basis of Osteoporosis, an indefinite award is appropriate. Impairment Award Period Osteoporosis Indefinite award How long will the needs last? - Fractures The repair of a fracture is a continuous and gradual process. The amount of time taken for a fracture to unite depends upon the type of fracture and which bones are affected. However, as a general rule, fractures need to be immobilised fo r between two to eight weeks. Following this, gentle exercises and movements are important, to build up bone and muscle strength. Physiotherapy may be required to assist this process. As a general rule, a return to about full function within 3 months usual ly occurs. The healing of osteoporotic fractures is not impaired, so any resultant disability may not last more than a few weeks or months. This is often the case in the younger person. However in the elderly, who have sustained repeated fractures and pro gressive collapse of the spine, no significant improvement in disability is likely. If a fracture has occurred, and this is the reason for the functional restrictions, the fracture should heal within 6 months.

There are unlikely to be any long term care and mobility needs aft er treatment. The exception to this is the enduring but rare side effects of chemotherapy. Needs are likely to arise when disease recurs. Stage 3 disease Long term side effects of treatment are infertility and early menopause. There are no long term disabling effects other than the rare enduring side effects of chemotherapy. Recurrent disease is common and may occur only a few months after treatment of initial disease - up to date medical evidence from the treating hospital will be important. Stage 4 disease Survival for two years after diagnosis with this stage of disease is a good outcome. Most of these people are terminally ill. Those that are fit enough to have surgery are likely to go on to have chemotherapy. A proportion may have many of the pro blems of the recurrent disease group described above. Problems specific to ovarian cancer include -: Pelvic pain syndromes Problems with the bowel or bladder, these may affect continence of either and occasionally the formation of a stoma such as a colo stomy or ileostomy if the lower bowel or rectum is affected by the cancer may be necessary Metastatic and recurrent disease The aim of treatment is to remove the cancer and try to get that person into remission usually with chemotherapy. Remission may la st for a variable length of time. During remission a woman would be expected to be well with no disabling effects. Once disease has returned and remission has ended it is a case of controlling the disease for as long as possible. Further chemotherapy and/o r surgery or radiotherapy may induce a second shorter remission but it will not cure it. For some women 4 - 6 lines of treatment may be given in this way over a number of years. There may be disabling effects from metastatic disease anywhere in the body i ncluding -: Liver metastases - these may cause pain, fatigue and in the later stages, mental confusion, abdominal swelling or pain and jaundice Abdominal bloating /distension due to fluid accumulation (ascites) Nausea /vomiting/ sub acute bowel obstruction due to peritoneal metastases - this may result in recurrent hospital admission in advanced disease Lung metastases or malignant pleural effusion - may cause very disabling breathlessness reducing mobility to a few yards.

In stage 1 and 2 of the disease, recovery from disabling effects of treatment and long term survival is expected. If needs are identified due to effects of treatment, a time limited award is likely to be appropriate. The same applies to stage 3 of the disease for needs ari sing due to treatment. However treatment is more intensive so it is expected that enduring effects of treatment and associated needs will be more common in this group. Recurrent disease is also common and needs are likely to arise for the first time or re -occur when cancer returns. Indefinite awards may be appropriate for some in this group. In stage 4 or recurrent disease or where treatment including chemotherapy and surgery is not possible, the woman is likely to be terminally ill. Indefinite awards will usually be appropriate. Stage 1 and 2 disease Five year survival from stage 1a or 1b disease is 80 - 90%. Five year survival from stage 2 disease is 60 -70%. In the rare situation where an award is appropriate during treatment of stage 1 or 2 ovarian ca ncer, the award should last for the duration of treatment and then be reviewed. Stage 3 disease Five year survival from stage 3 disease is 15 -35%. Stage 4 disease Five year survival for stage 4 disease is 5 -14%. Metastatic and recurrent disease This person is likely to be terminally ill although the expected survival may be longer than six months. After treatment of ovarian cancer the disease may recur often as a growth in either the pelvis or abdominal cavity. The majority of women with ovarian can cer have late stage disease when they are diagnosed. For this reason the majority of women with ovarian cancer will have recurrent disease at some point and most women diagnosed with ovarian cancer will die of the disease eventually.

They may be unable to walk far or cope with shopping and cleaning. In the terminal phase they are likely to require help with all aspects of personal care. Some will respond very well to palliative treatment, maintain weight and be able to fun ction well for several months before entering the terminal phase. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Localised (early stage) pancreatic cancer This group includes only 20% of those with pancreatic cancer, the y are likely to have presented with painless jaundice and gone on to have major surgery as treatment of their pancreatic cancer. Unless major complications such as pancreatic fistula develop as a result of surgery they are likely to be recovered from surge ry and any adjuvant therapy within 6 -9 months of starting treatment. Those with pancreatic fistula will require a year to recover and get back to normal activities. These people are likely to attend hospital very frequently and may have a surgical drain and/or wound dressings to manage for many months. They are likely to be on a supervised diet and take multiple prescribed drugs. They are likely to require help with washing and dressing wounds, possibly with getting dressed and be unable to manage a compl ex diet and supplements without help or support. Fatigue is likely to limit both mobility and self care. Once recovery is made from surgery and adjuvant treatment there may be a period of health where normal activities are possible. For some there will be an ongoing need to treat diabetes and take pancreatic enzyme supplements to maintain weight and health. For many this will be a short period, median survival after surgical treatment of early stage pancreatic cancer is only around 2 years. Where treatment is very disabling but long term prognosis is good, an award for the duration of treatment with review is appropriate. Around 15% will still be alive after five years. Advanced / Recurrent disease In this group needs are unlikely to be identified unless there are ongoing complications from surgery. Because of the poor outcome for this group any awards made during treatment should be for an indefinite period. The majority of this group will develop recurrent disease within two years of treatment; they are likely to have any of the symptoms of the advanced cancer group and at this stage once recurrent disease has developed, projected survival is less than six months. In all cases where needs are identified, it is appropriate to make indefinite awards as lif e is likely to be short. If disease recurs, survival and disabling effects are as for advanced pancreatic cancer. Life awards are recommended even if palliative treatment has appeared to restore health. Hormone producing or 'islet' cell tumours. Needs are unlikely to be identified during treatment except where there are severe complications after surgery - recovery may take up to a year. It is recommended time limited awards are made to coincide with the anticipated end of the recovery period. In the typical case a full return to health is expected. In the rare case where islet tumours are not amenable to surgery or there is metastatic disease treat as an advanced pancreatic cancer case.

Acute Pancreat itis Reports pertaining to episodes of acute pancreatitis may be obtained from Consultants or general practitioners . Once recovery is complete people are likely to be discharged from hospital outpatient ca re, and the general practitioner may be the most useful source of current clinical information. Chronic pancreatitis People whose condition is stable and whose symptoms are controlled by regular medication are likely to be under the care of general practi tioners from whom reports may be obtained. Newly diagnosed cases or those with progressive disease are likely to attend hospital out -patients, usually surgical or gastroenterology clinics. People with severe pain, including problems with opiate dependency, are likely to attend pain management clinics, from which reports can be requested. Specialist nurses and other health care professionals such as occupa tional therapists , psychologist's etc. working in these clinics may be able to provide information. Additional information may be obtained from community alcohol misuse services, or mental health services, in cases where alcohol misuse is the major coexisting health problem. An HCP examination report may be the most useful source of up to date information, if the condition is stable with infrequent clinic or GP attendance, or where there are additional disabling effects due to the psychological, physical and cognitive complications of alcohol misuse. Advice from Medical Services should be obtained when the management of chronic pancreatitis is complicated by the co existing problems of alcohol misuse and /or opiate dependency. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Acute Pancreatitis People may experience symptoms of fatigue and general debility for some weeks or even a few months after acute pancreatitis. However these are unlikely to restrict function to such a degree that mobility is limited or help with personal care is needed. Full recovery can be anticipated within a few weeks or months. Chronic pancreatitis There is much variation in the amount of abdominal pain e xperienced by people with chronic pancreatitis, and the resultant degree of functional restriction. In people with mild levels of functional restriction exacerbations of pain are intermittent, respond to treatment and resolve over the course of several days. It is unlikely that they will need help with self care, preparation of food or be restricted in their walking on a long term basis. Moderate levels of functional restrictions will be seen in people who require regular prescription of a more complex analgesic regime comprising several drugs, and who may take pancreatic supplements to prevent malabsorption. They may need additional analgesics and other treatments for exacerbations of pain, including hospital admission. Limitations in their ability to bend and stand for prolonged periods may affect their ability to prepare a meal or attend to all aspects of self care independently. Ability to walk long distances may be affected by abdominal pain and decreased muscle bulk, but most should be able to cove r reasonable distances. People with severe long -term pain (i.e. those on complex analgesic regimes including opiates and likely to be attending pain management clinics) may be restricted in their ability to stand, walk, bend, kneel, rise from a chair/toil et. Marked weight loss and poor muscle bulk will cause additional debility. They may need help with self care or cooking a meal; some may have significant problems in walking. Although opiate drugs have sedative effects, these effects are less pronounced i n long term users and are unlikely to lead to a need for continuous supervision in the home or out of doors. Needs may be more complex when there is associated alcohol misuse (see Alcohol misuse guidance). If cognitive imp airment is present, there may be additional requirements to supervise medicines, to ensure adequate nutrition to prevent weight loss, to attend to bodily functions etc. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Acut e Pancreatitis People with episodes of mild / moderate acute pancreatitis usually recover fully after some weeks with no long term ill effects. Those who have had more severe episodes requiring some time in hospital, or whose recovery has been complicated by development of pseudo -cysts etc. may take several months to make a full recovery. When cholecystectomy is advised in the convalescence phase recovery takes a few weeks longer. Some people are prone to relapsing episodes of acute pancreatitis, especial ly if they continue to drink excessive amounts of alcohol. Chronic pancreatitis There is no curative treatment for chronic pancreatitis once the condition is established. When the cause is alcohol ingestion abstinence is necessary to prevent deterioration. In milder cases, use of analgesics may be intermittent and in some cases attacks of pain will diminish and abate. As the condition worsens long -term use of pain relieving drugs is the norm. Good relief from the symptoms of malabsorption i s possible in many people with pancreatic enzyme supplements, and attention to diet to maintain a reasonable body weight. Once malabsorption is established the need for these formulations is life long. Following diagnosis only half of the people with the condition survive more than seven years. The worse prognosis is seen in those who continue to drink alcohol. Chronic pancreatitis predisposes to the development of cancer of the pancreas, which typically has a very limited prognosis (6 -18 months). Up to o ne fifth of deaths are due to pancreatic cancer. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Over 65 Acute Pancreatitis Elderly people may take longer to recover from acute pancreatitis, in particular if they have had complications or subsequent gallstone surgery. They may have a limited need for help with self care, especially if they have pre existing disabling medical conditions. Chronic pancreatitis Elderly people with chronic pancreatitis are likely to require more assistance with self -care, attention to diet, supervision of medicati on and help with toilet needs if diarrhoea is a long -term problem. They may also be prone to falls if they are underweight, frail or taking strong analgesics. The development of diabetes mellitus, and in particular the administration of insulin, may increa se the requirements for assistance and supervision.

They are likely to have unilateral tremor, normal balance, normal cognition and a UPD rating scale score of 1 -10. Mobility The ability to walk is unlikely to be impeded and they would normally be able to find their way around in unfamiliar places. Care The resulting disability is unlikely to affect their ability to independently carry out activities of daily living. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a moderate restriction are likely to have bilateral symptoms of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia but normal or mildly disturbed balance and rare falls, mild impairment of cognition and a UPD rating scale score of 11 -20. Mobility The ability to walk may be impeded and may fluctuate with some falls but they would normally be able to find their way around in unfamiliar places. Care The resulting disability may lead them to require assistanc e with undertaking complex activities and may require prompting to prepare food, take medication, deal with correspondence and financial matters and undertake appropriate activities. They may require assistance with some aspects of bodily function that in cludes toileting, washing, dressing, eating and drinking. They are not likely to require supervision to prevent potentially dangerous behaviours or activities. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a severe restriction are likely to have bilateral symptoms of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia and impairment of balance: Dementia, psychosis or confusion; and a UPD rating scale score of 21 -30. Mobility The ability to walk is highly likely to be impeded a nd they would not normally be able to find their way around safely in unfamiliar places. Care The resulting disability is likely to lead them to require assistance with most or even all activities of daily living.

They are likely to require supervision to prevent potentially dangerous behaviours or activities. Back to t op of section How long will the needs last? PD usually starts with mild unilateral involvement but in the majority of people progresses to bilateral disease with increasing difficulty in activities of daily living and self -care. Symptoms confined to one side are often seen early in the disease course (Hemi -parkinsonism). Eventually in those most severely affected, the person becomes bed or chair bound and unable to move. Many people however remain reasonably active but with increasing restrictions until they die from other causes. The rate of progression is very variable. Prior to the introduction of levodopa the average life expectancy was 9 years. With current treatment life expectancy has improved but is still slightly less than the normal population. Staging is as follows: - Stage 1 Unilateral involvement only. Stage 2 Bilateral involvement without impairment of balance. Stage 3 Impairment of balance and functional restriction. Stage 4 Fully developed disease retaining ability to walk and stand unassisted but otherwise markedly incapacitated. Stage 5 Bed bound or wheelchair bound unless aided.

If the claim pack has been completed on behalf of the customer, by someone who has a good understanding of his or her needs, then it could provide good evidence. Hospital Factual Repo rt In cases of moderate and severe peripheral vascular disease, a Consultant Vascular Surgeon would normally have been involved in the diagnosis, management and treatment of the individual. Indeed the absence of any documented his tory of a specialist consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if required. General Practitioner Factual report The General Prac titioner would normally have made the initial referral of the claimant to the Consultant, and would normally be aware of the results of tests, and current medication. If there is no specialist health professional involvement, or evidence cannot be obtained from them, then a factual report from the claimant's own doctor would be more appropriate. HCP Examination Report An HCP examination report would be likely to be necessary when t he person claims significant disability (equivalent t o a moderate or severe condition), but there is no supporting evidence from the GP or Hospital Specialist; if no corroborative evidence has been able to be obtained; or if it is the only means whereby the claimant's needs can be clarified. Medical Service s The Medical Services doctor may be asked to request relevant information such as test results from the GP or Hospital Consultant, and to interpret test results and other information. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling effects With mild functional restriction there are normally no disabling effects which are significant enough to lead to care or mobility needs. Mobility A person with mild functional restriction would normally be able to manage to walk more than two hundred metres at a normal or slightly slower pace. He/she would normally be able to get around in an unfamiliar place withou t assistance. The person should be encouraged to walk to build up a collateral circulation. Their mobility depends on their lifestyle. ADL A person with mild functional restriction would normally be able to cope with all activities of self -care such as getting in or out of a bed or chair unaided, getting on & off the toilet, washing, bathing, dressing him/herself and preparing and cooking a meal. He/she should be able to get about indoors satisfactorily, bend to get food in or out of an oven and self - medicate. He/she would still normally be able to climb stairs unaided, though he/she may have some calf pain on reaching the top. There would be no supervisory needs. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling effects With moderate functional restriction there are normally no disabling effects, which are significant enough to lead to care needs. There will however be a significant restriction of walking ability as the 'claudication' distance will be quite short. These person s may be on a waiting list for surgery, which if successful, normally greatly improves mobility. Mobility A person with moderate functional restriction would normally only be able to walk a distance of more than 50 metres and less than 100 metres at a slightly slower pace than usual. After a rest he/she can resume walking and manage the same distance as before (this will be constant; it is the 'claudication' distance). The recovery time can be quite variable. He/she would normally be able to get around in an unfamiliar place without assistance. ADL A person with moderate functional restriction would normally be able to cope with all activities of self -care such as getting in or out of a bed or chair unaided, getting on & off the toilet, washing, bathing, dressing him/herself and preparing and cooking a meal. He/she should normally still be able to bend to get food in or out of an oven and self -medicate. He/she would still normally be able to get about indoors and climb stairs unaided, though he/s he may have to stop on the way up and at the top of the stairs. There would be no supervisory needs. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling effects A person with severe functional restriction may have severe diffuse disease which is not amenable to surgery, or be on the waiting list for surgery, because of the extent of the narrowing of the artery/arteries. They are likely to suffer from rest pain and may have ulceration of the skin of the foot or leg. They may be abo ut to lose a limb or may have lost a limb and would normally have considerable mobility needs and significant care needs. Mobility A person with severe functional restriction may have one or both limbs amputated and may be wheelchair or bed bound or alter natively may have a prosthetic limb. They may be on the waiting list for surgery and would range from having intermittent rest pain to severe and constant rest pain. He/she would normally, if mobile be only able to walk a few steps at a slow pace, (certain ly less than 25 metres), or may not be capable of walking at all. Even a distance of 25 metres can be severely disabling, because of recovery time. However, there are not likely to be any supervisory needs outdoors. ADL A person with severe functional restriction would normally need assistance with most aspects of self -care, such as getting in and out of bed or out of a chair, getting on and off the toilet, bathing or showering. He/she may not be able to get about unaided in or out of doors. Preparation of a meal may not be possible because he/she may not be able to safely manage hot pans and would be unlikely to be able to bend to an oven satisfactorily. He/she would normally be able to take medication safely. He/she would not be able to ma nage stairs. At night, he/she may need assistance to change position in bed and to get comfortable. He/she would need help normally in getting out of bed in the night and to get on and off the toilet. However, a bottle could be used instead. The person may be bed bound or chair bound because of greatly reduced mobility. He/she may already have an amputation to one or both legs. The person normally does not require supervision for any aspect of daily living but would normally need to be very careful not to i njure their lower limbs because any injuries would be likely to take a very long time to heal or lead to ulceration. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? A five year review of patients with claudicatio n has shown that -: About 75% remain stable or have an improvement in symptoms. These people need to be reviewed, as they may not have disabling effects 20% develop worsening claudication 5% develop critical ischaemia 1% undergo limb amputation A person with PVD has a six to seven time's greater risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack (mini - stroke) than the rest of the population. If a person has heart disease, he/she has a 1 in 3 chance of having blocked ar teries in the legs. (Reference: NHLBI US Department of Health & Human Services) It also depends on what has caused the PVD in the first place -: Treatment of a single cause (such as an embolus) normally gives good results. A supervised exercise regime in persons with chronic lower limb ischaemia, due to generalised arteriosclerosis definitely improves claudication distance. Worsening, severe ischaemia in the lower limbs treated with angioplasty or bypass grafting (CABG) produces good results. The annual mortality rate of persons with intermittent claudication is greater than 5% (which is 2 to 3 times higher than the \"normal\" population. The annual mortality rate of those with severe disease (severe critical ischaemia) is 25% (mostly from other cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke). Impairment Award Period Peripheral Vascular disease (PVD) / Claudication -: If awaiting surgery If no surgery is planned 1 year award indefinite award Buerger's disease -: If awaiting surgery If no surgery is planned 1 year award indefinite award Other peripheral arterial disease (excluding coronary) / type not known -: If awaiting surgery If no surgery is planned 1 year award indefinite award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Over 65 PVD is very common in the elderly, 10% of those over 70 will have symptoms. They may omit to, or forget to mention symptoms of intermittent claudication or critical ischaemia to their doctor. The symptoms may be masked, if they decrease their exercise levels. Lifes tyle changes, exercise rehabilitation programmes and medical treatment should be offered to and given to elderly patients. Surgical treatment and procedures should be implemented; as long as the patient's general condition is good enough.

Read more about effects in the over 65 age group What evidence is available? Self-assessment is the prime source of evidence, but the claim pack should be checked to see who has completed it. If the form has been filled in by the customer, due to the nature of their condition, it might not necessarily be an accurate or reliable des cription of their problems. If the claim pack has been completed on behalf of the customer, by someone who has a good understanding of his or her needs, then it could provide good evidence. The DM should bear in mind that the completion of the corroborative statement by a mental health professional does not necessarily mean that they endorse what has been said in the claim pack. In the vast majority of cases of moderate and severe personality disorders a consultant psychiatrist will have been involved in the management and treatment of the individual. Indeed the absence of any documented history of a psychiatric consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis. However in some areas, people with moderate or severe personality disorders may not be referred to psychiatric services. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if they are required and they are available. An HCP examination report may be helpful if t he person has physical problems Other sources of information include the following: Care co -ordinator When the customer is being supported by a community mental health team the care co -ordinator on that team will be the preferred source o f further evidence. They have lead responsibility for the delivery of the care plan and so they can give details of the support that the customer has been assessed as needing. They will also know whether the customer is being helped by an Assertive Outre ach or Crisis Resolution team. Community Mental Health Team The community mental health team provides a multidisciplinary team approach. The team will include psychiatrists, community psychiatric nurses, occupational therapists and social workers working in close collaboration with social service departments. One member of the team may co -ordinate the care and is known as the Care Co -ordinator. Community Psychiatric Nurse (CPN) A customer may be in regular contact with a CPN who will have assessed their care requirements. Advice is given about the amount of psychiatric nursing required and the administration of drugs. The CPN will be in contact with other mental health professionals. They are well placed to provide detail ed evidence about the customer's needs. NHS Care Programme Approach (CPA) care plan When the customer is in contact with mental health services there will be a care plan under the NHS Care Programme Approach. The care plan will include information on health and social care as well as domestic support and is reviewed regularly. The customer is given their own copy, which could be requested, as it will contain useful evidence of needs. Social Services care plan Social Servic es departments may be approached for help by someone with mental health problems. A community care assessment by a social worker/care manager will be arranged and a care plan produced. The care plan will include details of the customer's day-to-day living and the support provided. A copy can be obtained from the customer. Mental Health Social Worker Where a mental health social worker has been appointed to support a customer they will have information about t he customer's ability to cope with everyday living. Subject to consent to approach them being given, the mental health social worker will be able to provide some useful evidence about the customer's needs. Day Centre and Psychiatric Day Hospital Attendance at a day centre (not on hospital site) or psychiatric day hospital (on hospital site) is likely to indicate severe disability. These are therapeutic environments for evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of patients with mental health problems. They are staffed by psychiatric nurses, and there is input from all other members of the community mental health team. Attendance presents an alternative for patients whose condition requires intensive treatment, but do not need to be hospitalised. Accommodation manager When the customer is living in supported accommodation then the type and level of support provided could be helpful in determining their need for help. A phone call to the accommodation manager could p rovide useful evidence. Crisis Resolution Team The customer may have been supported during a crisis by the Crisis Resolution Team. The teams are mainly comprised of CPNs, who would make urgent visits, day or night to anyone who is thought to be in need of hospitalisation. The idea is to provide intensive treatment at home instead. The Crisis Resolution Team would be well placed to provide details of the customer's condition. General practitioner factual report If there is no specialist mental health prof essional involvement or evidence cannot be obtained from them, then it may be necessary to request a GP factual report from the customer's own doctor. The GP may have only limited knowledge of customer's mental health problems, ev en when there is no one else involved. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Life and Mobility needs The difficulties experienced by a person with a personality disorder (PD) depend upon the type of disorder and the de gree to which it is exhibited. There is a continuum of behaviour from the exhibition of a particular personality trait to the actual diagnosis of a personality disorder. Some of these traits may be desirable attributes in particular occupations e.g. obsessional traits in research or in the legal profession and histrionic characteristics in the performing arts. The different features of the individual personality disorders can affect a person's functional capacity in specific ways. Coping with tasks involving contact with others may be affected by people with most of the diagnostic categories, but particularly avoidant, dependent and borderline PD. For example, anxiety and agitation may be so severe as to cause accidents, avoidance b ehaviour may cause inability to open letters or pay bills, and disturbed self -image may make productive working relationships impossible. People with obsessive compulsive PD may have difficulty in completing tasks within a reasonable period. Daily living may be affected in schizoid, borderline, narcissistic, avoidant and dependent disorders; self -neglect can be extreme at times, and activities such as shopping or using public transport can cause considerable anxiety. There may be extreme emotional labili ty in borderline disorders or an abnormal fixation with appearance in narcissistic and histrionic disorders. Social interaction is affected by all disorders to a greater or lesser extent. The conditions exerting the greatest effect are schizoid (where a person has no interest in relating to others) and avoidant (where he or she fears interaction with others). These people may lead solitary existences without any normal family or social contact. Those with paranoid, schizotypal, narcissistic, obsessive co mpulsive or histrionic PD may exhibit interactions with others characterised by bizarre behaviour or beliefs. Antisocial PD may or may not be manifest in day -to-day social interactions. Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a mild functional restriction are likely to have some of the following -: Not be receiving psychiatric care or supervision and have no care plan. Be able to enjoy interests and hobbies for most of the time. Be able to do their own shopping, cooking and cleaning. Manage their own finances. Mobility They should not have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and should not require guidance or supervision. ADL They would not normally exhibit significant self - neglect an d would not normally put themselves or others at risk of danger. They should not normally have any significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day -to-day activities. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a moderate functional restriction are likely to have some of the following -: Have co morbidity with drug or alcohol abuse or other psychiatric illnesses. Be receiving drug treatment or psychosocial interventions. Be attending psychiatric outpatients or psychiatric day hospital. Be under the care of the community mental health team. Be on a standard care plan. Have had more than one episode of self harm. Left previous employment due to excessive anxiety and inability to cope. Be living with little social contact. Mobility They are unlikely to have any physical difficulty with walking. They are unlikely to have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and are unlikely to require guidance or supervision. They may be reluctant to go out but are unlikely to benefit from having a companion to encourage them to go out. ADL They may have intermittent episodes of self neglect but these are unlikely to last for more than a few weeks at a time. Because of their reluctance to go out, together with their inability to carry out day to day activities in a timely fashion, they may require help with activities such as shopping, preparing meals and management of housing and financial affairs. It should be noted that they may be unwilling to accept help in engaging in social activities. They may engage in risk taking behaviour, for example, unprotected sex or drug taking but presence of a companion is not likely to be able to prevent this. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a severe functional restriction are likely to have some of the following -: Have had a compulsory psychiatric admission in the past. Have had frequent episodes of self harm in the past. Have co morbidity with drug or alcohol abuse or another psychiatric illness. Be living in supported accommodation or homeless. Be on an enhanced care plan. Have bizarre or frightening behaviour towards other people. Have a chaotic unstructured lifestyle. Be living in social isolation. Mobility They are unlikely to have any physical difficulty with walking. They may have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and may require guidance or supervision either because they may be considered a danger to themselves or others or because of overwhelming anxiety and lack of self confidence. ADL They may have persistent self neglect. Because of their unstable mental state they may require promptin g for all activities of daily living such as maintaining hygiene, shopping, preparing meals and management of housing and financial affairs. They may be distressed at night and on occasion this may require someone to watch over them in order to provide rea ssurance and prevent injury or danger to themselves or others. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Personality disorders (PD) are lifelong conditions so no major change is likely. Some disorders, especially of emotional control, can improve with age and maturation. This is less so for obsessive compulsive, schizoid and paranoid types. Normal individuals tend to become less emotional and impulsive and more cautious and careful with age; a person with a personality disorder less so. People with antisocial personality disorder are usually most destructive in their early life. They are diagnosed most frequently between the ages of 30 and 35 and can \"burn out\" later in life, becoming less antisocial. Domestic d isturbances, child abuse and alcohol abuse may persist. There is also a higher incidence of death by violence and suicide. Between 30 and 60% of completed suicides retrospectively show evidence of a personality disorder. People with obsessional personality disorders are at a high risk of progression to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) or to depressive illness. People with OCD can be severely functionally restricted and people with obsessive compulsive PD, although they are less an xious than those with OCD, may be equally functionally restricted. People with paranoid and schizotypal PD may progress to schizophrenia, but those with schizoid PD do not. Borderline PD carries a relatively favourable prognosis with clinical recovery i n over 50% at 10 to 25 year follow up. The prognosis for personality disorders is improved if the person establishes a stable relationship with another person. Specialised treatment results in substantial improvement in 1/3 to 2/3 of patients. Specialise d treatment may take up to 4 years to achieve full effect. People who do not receive specialised treatment are unlikely to improve in the long term. Therefore the following awards should be considered -: Impairment Award Period Personality disorder -: Receiving specialised treatment First award - 5 year award Subsequently - Indefinite award Not receiving specialised treatment Indefinite award However, in some cases there is potential for improvement in the condition in the longer term especially if further specialised treatment is received. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual cl aimant.

Linked pages: Ageing Falls Frailty What is Phlebitis Phlebitis is the general term for an inflammation of the wall of a vein which can be caused by several factors. When the vein wall becomes inflamed it can result in the development of thrombosis (blood clot) within the lumen which blocks the flow of blood. It is rare for phlebitis to occur without thrombosis. Phlebothrombosis is the general term for blood -clotting within a vein. If the superficial veins are affected the condition is known as 'superficial thrombophlebitis' and as 'deep vein thrombosis' (DVT) when deep veins are involved. What evidence is available? In cases with complications or where there is residual severe venous insufficiency there may be functional deficit affecting walking and stan ding. The severity of disability and outlook for these individuals should be evident from information available from a hospital or the General Practitioner . Activities of Daily Living and Mobility Conside rations Superficial thrombophlebitis This should not present any problems with general bodily function. An attack is likely to be short -lived and although it can be recurrent the overall effect on function should be negligible. It may occur in associatio n with an underlying condition such as heart, chest or malignant disease which may functional disability in their own right but the overall needs of the individual would need to be assessed in light of the available evidence relating to the other condition s. Other than in the acute phase walking need not be avoided and indeed reasonable exercise is considered to be beneficial for improving venous circulation. Deep Vein Thrombosis This is generally a benign treatable condition but can have disastrous effects if it results in thromboembolism. Sudden death can occur in unrecognised disease. However most recover with treatment with no residual limitation of activity. As with superficial vein disease exercise is generally beneficial for improvin g venous circulation and prevention of further episodes of thrombosis. How long will the needs last? Unless there is an associated condition which increases the likelihood of recurrence the prognosis is good with return to normal activity expected in most cases.

Weakness of the lower limbs, deformed joints, poor balance and osteoporosis may also render them more prone to falls and fractures. What evidence is available? Acute Poliomyelitis People recovering from acute paralytic poliomyelitis are likely to have received hospital care from neurologists, physiotherapists , occupational therapists , orthopaedic su rgeons and specialists in rehabilitation medicine. General practitioners are also able to provide medical reports. It may be helpful to obtain an HCP Examination Report , if a person's condition is stable and they are no longer attending hospital clinics for treatment or follow up. HCP Examination Report is also the most useful option when the infection was contracted and treated abroad, and there are no readily available medical records. Late Effects of Poli o and the Post Polio Syndrome Neurologists, specialist nurses in neurological clinics, rheumatologists, orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists and rehabilitation experts may be app roached for reports. General practitioners may also be unable to provide medical reports. An HCP Examination report is useful in cases where there is no up to date information on the existing level of disability from other sources, or deterioration has occ urred since the last assessment. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Acute Poliomyelitis Following an acute paralytic attack recovery takes place over 12 months and in many cases there are ultimately minimal or mild functional restrictions only. People are able to care for themselves and are not restricted in their ability to walk. The severity and extent of the functional restrictions after recovery depends on whether both upper and lower limbs are affected, which limb(s) are weak or paralysed, and whether respiratory problems causing shortness of breath persist. The person who is left with a shortened wasted leg may be restricted in their ability to stand for prolonged periods, to walk fa r and to bend down. Use of aids such as callipers, orthoptic splints, walking sticks etc. can improve the ability to stand and walk. Some people with severe weakness of both legs may need to use a wheel chair. They may also be prone to falls and unable to walk without support. Paralysis and weakness of one or both upper limbs may cause difficulties in reaching, lifting, carrying, griping and carrying out fine movements. The person may need help with washing, dressing, personal hygiene and preparing food. P eople who have functional restrictions affecting both upper and lower limbs will have a greater need for help from others. People who require assisted ventilation on a long -term basis may need help from others to use the equipment at home. This is more li kely to be the case if they have upper limb weakness or paralysis. Assisted ventilation may only be required overnight. People with residual respiratory difficulties may be short of breath and fatigued when they walk. Late Effects of Polio and the Post Po lio Syndrome The severity of the functional restrictions in a person with late polio will depend to a large extent on the nature and extent degree of the original disabling effects (see acute poliomyelitis guidance). It is necessary to consider which limbs are affected, whether there is spinal and/or chest deformity and whether there are bulbar symptoms affecting breathing. It is unlikely that existing care needs will lessen significantly in most cases, although replacement of arthritic joints may improve i ndividual limb function. Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Effects In people with weakness or wasting in one limb only, or with lesser degrees of weakness in two limbs, functional restrictions may be mild. Mobility They are able to walk reasonable distances without undue difficulty. Function may be improved by provision of new aids, joint replacement and rehabilitation as described above. ADL They are able to care for themselves. Function may be improved by provision of new aids, jo int replacement and rehabilitation as described above. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Effects The degree of functional restriction is likely to be greater if the function of more than one limb is affected by the original illness, or by the presence of arthritis or deformity of the non -affected limb. Increased muscle weakness and wasting in affected limbs will further restrict function. Moderate functional restriction will also be present if pain from spinal deformities and spinal arthritis affects arm and/or leg use. Fatigue and shortness of breath may also restrict activities. Mobility If the lower limbs are affected there may be restricted walking, that is exacerbated by pain, fatigue and shortness of breath. ADL People with moderate functional restrictions may take longer to carry out tasks than previously. Many are likely to need some help with certain aspects of self - care and/or food preparation. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Effects Severe functional restriction is most likely when both upper and lower limbs are weak, wasted and paralysed. Associated spinal conditions, deformity of the spine and/or chest may be present. Mobility People are likely to be using wheelchairs and other aids or walking may be significantly reduced by pain, fatigue and shortness of breath. ADL They may already have home adaptations to aid function and enable independent living. The use of mechanical ventilation at home is likely to an indication of more severe levels of functional restriction. The time taken to carry out tasks may be significantly reduced by pain, fatigue and shortness of breath. People with severe functional restrictions are likely to need help with all aspects of dressing, persona l hygiene and food preparation. They may need help to feed and to drink, and with using aids e.g. to assist respiration. Help may be needed to move around the house, to manage stairs, to rise from a chair, to use the toilet and to get in and out of wheel c hair. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Acute Poliomyelitis 50% of people with paralytic polio recover completely; the remainder have a variety of residual disabilities. Paralysed muscles continue to recover over several months; however paralysis still present at 12 months tends to be permanent. Since the acute disease is often contracted in childhood or adolescence before growth is complete, the disabling effects may be complicated by the normal development of the rest of the body. For example, while one leg may be wasted and paralysed by the disease, the other leg will however grow normally. This results in the affected leg becoming shorter than the normal leg. Similarly abnormal development of o ne upper or lower limb may lead to curvature of the spine causing deformity of the trunk. The chest may become deformed due to unequal muscle development predisposing to recurrent infections and breathing problems. Although recovery of the respiration usu ally occurs, some people may need long -term assistance with breathing. They may continue to require mechanical ventilation at night, because weakened respiratory muscles function less effectively when the person lies down. During the day they are able to b reathe spontaneously. Some people who have had bulbar polio have long -term difficulties with swallowing and speech. In cases of polio contracted in childhood or adolescence the pattern and extent of the residual disabling effects stabilise by the early tw enties. Late Effects of Polio and the Post Polio Syndrome Functional improvement for the individual is the aim of the multidisciplinary management described above, and many people can be helped in this way. Recognition of late functional deterioration an d the post polio syndrome does not necessarily imply that the condition is progressive in that person, or that significant deterioration in function should be anticipated in the future. The condition often stabilises.

If the claim pack has been completed on behalf of the customer, by someone who has a good understanding of his or her needs, then it would provide good evidence. GP A GP factual report should provide information about the patient's condition, as often they are treated by the GP, without being referred to the Hospital Consultant. Hospital factual Report In the absence of a GP factual Report, a report from a Hospital Consultant would provide information about investigations, treatment, r esponse to the treatment, condition of the patient, and visits to the clinic. HCP Examination Report An HCP visit providing history and examination may be necessary in the absence of any other available corroborative evidence, if th ere is contradictory information or if it is the only means by which the claimant's needs can be clarified. Medical Services Medical Services are available to interpret information including investigation results, and a lso to request relevant information from the GP or hospital Consultant. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs A person's care and mobility needs should be assessed in relation to their symptom s and response to treatment. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, a person may have difficulties with the following activities -: Self- care Getting in and out of bed, washing, bathing including getting in and out of the bath, going to the toilet, dressing and undressing, preparing a meal, walking in the house, and climbing stairs. Mobility Walking on the flat may be impaired by muscle pain and stiffness. However, response to treatment is usually quite rapid; the person feels better in a matter o f days rather than weeks. These needs may be present for a short time only and that is usually a few weeks at the most. In summary, treatment should alleviate the symptoms and the person should have few or no care needs arising from Polymyalgia Rheumatic a (PMR). How long will the needs last? Polymyalgia Rheumatica normally improves dramatically with treatment, so care and mobility needs may only be present for a few weeks at the most, though steroid treatment is likely to need to continue for at least 2 years. The only disabling effects would be from vascular complications such as complete or partial loss of vision or stroke. Click the link for details of -: Visual Impairment Stroke Also, bearing in mind the side effects of long - term steroid use, there may be associated problems (such as osteoporosis, weight gain, diabetes and high blood pressure) and the maintenance dose should be kept as low as possib le. Also osteoporosis prevention medication should be used (usually calcium and vitamin D and a biphosphonate). Sudden blindness may be permanent, and if a stroke (rarely) occurs, there will not be likely to be improvement after 2 years. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Over 65 It is a disease which is not diagnosed under the age of 55. The most problematic factor is the dependence on long -term steroids and the side -effects caused by this treatment. Side -effects are less if the maintenance dose is kept below 7.5mg per day. Azathi oprine may be used to reduce the dose of steroid. Medication to prevent osteoporosis (calcium and Vitamin D and a biphosphonate such as disodium etidronate) should be routinely used but particularly in the older person.

Examples of suitable evidence might include asking the person for a copy of a Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (CICB) report if avai lable or requesting a factual report from an appropriate Health Care Professional . Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Having functional impairment is part of the diagnosis of PTSD. If there is no functional impairment another diagnosis should be considered. Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a mild functional restriction are likely -: Not to have been referred for trauma focussed psychological treatment Be under GP care only Not be attending day centre or day hospital Have no associated psychiatric disorder Mobility They will have no physical difficulty in getting around. They should not have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and should not require guidance or supervision. ADL They should not normally exhibit significant self -neglect. They should not normally have any significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day -to- day activ ities. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a moderate functional restriction are likely to: Have current involvement of or awaiting assessment by counsellor, CPN, psychologist, occupational therapist Not be attending day centre or day hospital Have mild associated psychiatric disorder(s) Mobility They will have no physical difficulty in getting around. They should not have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and should not require guidance or supervision. ADL They should not normally exhibit significant self -neglect. They should not normally have any significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day -to- day activ ities. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a severe functional restriction are likely to: Be unable to resume their occupation because of avoidance behaviour Have been treated with trauma focussed psychological treatment and drug treatment (drug treatment at maximum tolerated limit or use of olanzapine) Have current involvement of or awaiting assessment by psychiatrist within the community mental health team Attend day centre or day hospital or be d ischarged due to failure to respond to treatment or failed to attend due to severity of symptoms Have severe associated psychiatric disorder(s) Mobility They will have no physical difficulty in getting around. Their psychological avoidance may make it difficult for them to carry out certain activities, depending upon the nature of the traumatic event. For example they may have difficulty getting into a car, getting onto a bus or the tube etc. Alternatively they may only be able to carry out these activities with a companion for reassurance. However, they are unlikely to be unable to find their way around in unfamiliar surroundings. ADL The majority of people will have no care requirements. However, in a minority, if there is a severe associated psychiatric disorder, the following care requirements may be necessary -: Need encouragement to get out of bed in the morning Need encouragement to wash, dress and maintain hygiene Assistance in preparing meals Encouragement to go out and engage in social a ctivities Help with domestic crises Assistance with taking medication and obtaining prescriptions Attendance at doctors appointments, hospital appointments and day hospital Help with correspondence, financial matters and paying bills Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Long term outcome depends upon initial symptom severity, duration of illness, social support and past history. In general people with PTSD who have no previous history and normal stable backgrounds tend to have a good prognosis. People who fail to recover tend to have coexisting or previous psychiatric history or a complicating factor such as depression or substance abuse. The prognosis for people with severe initial symptoms is wo rse than for people with less severe initial symptoms. The prognosis is worse the longer the duration of the illness. About half of people with PTSD will recover within 12 months. About two thirds of people with PTSD will recover within 6 years. One third of people with PTSD have a chronic illness lasting more than 6 years. Therefore the following awards should be considered -: Impairment Award Period Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) First award period - 1 year award Second award period - 5 year award Subsequently - Indefinite award However, in some cases there is potential for improvement in the condition in the longer term. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Over 65 PTSD in elderly people usually results from exactly the same reasons as any other age group, for example as a result of being a victim of crime or violence. Very occasionally it can result from problems earlier in life. Symptoms may be persistent or intermittent, and the disorder may be time-limited or chronic. Increasing severity of trauma and pre -morbid psychiatric illness predispose to the development of PTSD, and certain personality traits and good psychosocial support protect against it. Elderly people do not appear more predisposed than young persons to develop PTSD, and symptoms of the disorder are simi lar to those in younger people. Treatment is identical to that of younger people although no research has been carried out on the treatment of PTSD in the elderly.

Disabling complications such as malnutrition, muscle weakness and osteoporosis are likely to be prominent and care needs will be greater. What evidence is ava ilable? Most cases of primary biliary cirrhosis will have been diagnosed and assessed in a hospital clinic. They will be followed up in gastroenterology or specialist liver clinics to monitor treatment response and to determine when referral for liver tra nsplantation should be considered. Hospital reports may be obtained from hospital doctors and specialist nurses working in these clinics. People with early disease or whose condition progresses slowly, may visit the hospital infr equently. General Practitioner factual reports will confirm the diagnosis, provide details of drug treatment and information about other medical conditions that may contribute to care and mobility needs. It may be appropriate to c onsider a claim under Special Rules for people with this condition who develop hepato -cellular carcinoma. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs People with minimal symptoms are likely to have few functional restrictions. This situation may pertai n for a number of years and they will have no care and mobility needs. As the disease progresses severe fatigue may limit daily activities. The severity of the fatigue may not correlate closely with other symptoms and signs of the disease. When severe it m ay lead to a need for help with personal care and limit ability to walk. Other factors such as low body weight, muscle weakness, bone pain, increasing jaundice etc. may limit function. People will have difficulties rising from a chair, using the toilet, pr eparing food, walking around the house, climbing stairs. People with the late complications including advanced liver failure, ascites and portal hypertension are likely to need care and have reduced mobility. This will include those waiting for a transplant for end stage failure, most of who may be considered to be in the terminal phase. If evidence shows that the customer has liver failure, which may have resulted from primary biliary cirrhosis then go to Liver Failur e guidance. For further information about cirrhosis please see Cirrhosis guidance. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? People with few or no symptoms at diagnosis develop some symptoms within five to seven years. Progression is however very variable and some people remain relatively well for many years, surviving at least twenty years. Overall the disease reduces life expectancy. Factors associated with a poor outl ook are weight loss, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), increasing age, increasing jaundice and evidence of impaired liver function. People presenting with jaundice survive on average less than five years. One year survival aft er transplantation is 85 -90% with a good outlook thereafter. In about 10% of people undergoing transplantation the disease recurs in the new liver a few years later. For further information about cirrhosis go to Cirrhosis guid ance. If evidence shows that the customer has liver failure, which may have resulted from primary biliary cirrhosis then go to Liver Failure guidance.

Localised prostate cancer treated by radical radiotherapy or surgery Treatments such as radical radiotherapy or prostatectomy have significant long term side effects for some men. These include urinary incontinence and impotence after treatment a nd diarrhoea after radical radiotherapy. A return to normal activities is expected in the majority of cases. 5 -10 % of men are likely to be very affected by ongoing side effects 12 months after treatment. If needs are present at this stage they are likely to persist. Locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent disease Treatment such as radiotherapy may cause significant fatigue and diarrhoea. There may be any of the effects of metastatic disease but bone metastases are particularly common and are painful. Me tastases in the spine are common and back pain may significantly affect the ability to walk. Medication for pain may increase fatigue. Spinal cord compression may cause lower limb problems from numbness and unsteady gait to paralysis of the legs with blad der and bowel control problems. These may or may not resolve with appropriate treatment, it is a sign of advanced disease. Hormone therapy causes significant and sometimes distressing changes in body image, hot flushes and fatigue. Once hormone therapy t reatment has stopped working, any disabling effects of disease are likely to be permanent or get worse. Survival after treatment has stopped working is likely to be in the range of 4 -18 months. Needs are likely develop in this group and increase over time. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Localised prostate cancer treated by radical radiotherapy or surgery Treatment and recovery is likely to take up to a year. Needs identified as a result of treatment of si de effects would be expected to resolve on return to health. Small numbers of men will experience ongoing side effects at one year and these men are likely to have ongoing needs. Long term side effects of treatment may arise years later and give rise to ne eds, which are also likely to be ongoing. Locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent disease Once needs are identified these are likely to continue and may increase as disease progresses. Life awards are recommended. Impairment Award Period Prostate cancer -: Localised & treated by radical radiotherapy or surgery Locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent disease 1 year award (if entitlement appropriate) Indefinite award All information must be taken into account when considering the dura tion of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Over 65 Many prostate cancers behave benignly; they do not spread beyond the prostate or cause any disabling effects. Such a person is likely to be on no treatment for their prostate cancer although they may have had some surgery to improve their urine flow. They will be kept under 'active surveillance' to make sure treatment starts as soon as it is nee ded. This type of prostate cancer is rare in men under 50 and common in men over 70.

The claimant and/or carer is unlikely to be able to provide the information required to accurately assess mobility and care needs. Further details should be obtaine d from the General Practitioner or Consultant . Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs The overall level of functional restriction will depend upon the number of joints affected and the combination of upper and lower limb involvement. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Lower limb - Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction would not have any noticeable disabilities on an everyday basis. Pain, discomfort, joint swelling and/or stiffness will often be low grade or minimal, and normally wears off quite quickly as the person \"limbers up\" in the morning. Although there may be exacerbations, these would be i nfrequent and not occur on a regular basis. Mobility A person with mild restriction would normally have no physical difficulty in getting around. Nor would they require guidance or supervision outdoors. ADL A person with mild restriction would normally be able to dress independently and put on socks and shoes, using simple technical aids if required. The ability to rise from sitting, attend to own toilet needs and prepare a main meal would not be impaired to any significant degree. Such a person would normally be capable of maintaining personal hygiene. They would have little or no functional limitation on a day - to-day basis arising from any symptoms and would not need supervision or watching over. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Lower limb - Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction may experience persistent swelling (effusions) of their hips, knees, ankles and/or feet. Deformity of some or all of these joints may be present. There may be instability of one or both knees. Pain and joint stiffness would be present on rising in the morning, or following prolonged inactivity, for up to one hour. However, there may be periods of \"flare -ups\" when increa sed help is needed with self -care. A \"flare -up\" typically lasts between 10 to 14 days. Mobility A person with moderate restriction may have significant difficulty getting around in terms of distance due to an abnormal gait, walking stiffly and with a lim p. They will be unable to walk at normal speed and distance is likely to be in the range of 40 -100 metres. Such a person may need physical assistance from another person in getting around and may require guidance or supervision outdoors on account of an increased risk of falling. ADL A person with moderate restriction may have difficulties with getting out of a normal height chair, out of bed, rising from a toilet and getting out of a bath. These problems would normally be most severe after resting. T he use of prescribed assistive equipment such as a raised chair, a raised toilet seat or grab rails may help to reduce these difficulties. Such a person may have knee instability, which could indicate risk of falls, though use of prescribed assistive equip ment such as a stick may help to reduce this. No supervision or watching over needs are likely to be present. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Lower limb - Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction would have gross lower limb joint deformity and restriction of joint movement. They may be on the waiting list for hip, knee or ankle replacement surgery, or for surgery to correct foot and/or toe deformities. Pain and/or stiffness would be present for up to two hours after rising, and may affect the person during the night. A person with severe restriction would have joint destruction with marked deformities and weakness of ligaments, tendons and muscles. This wo uld lead to an increased risk of falls and reduced mobility. Mobility Mobility may be impaired, with active inflammation (flare -ups) of lower limb joints. When the feet are affected, there may be severe pain on walking. If the knees and hips are involved, standing and sitting can be difficult and painful, and mobility will be restricted even further. Joint instability may also occur. Instability affecting the knee joint will lead to an increased risk of falls with restriction of mobility. A perso n with severe restriction would need physical assistance from another person in getting around and may require guidance or supervision outdoors on account of an increased risk of falling. ADL Such a person would need assistance from another person with dressing and washing, getting out of bed and attending to toilet needs, and to prevent falls. Help may be needed with care needs during the day for much of the time. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Upper Limb Condition - Mild Functional Re striction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of restriction are unlikely to have any noticeable disabilities on an everyday basis. Pain, discomfort, joint swelling and/or stiffness will often be low grade or minimal, and normally wears off quite quickly as the person \"limbers up\" in the morning. Although there may be exacerbations, these would be infrequent and not occur on a regular basis. They are probably would not have any significant long -term care or mobility needs. Mobility A person with mild restriction would normally have no physical difficulty in getting around. Nor would they require guidance or supervision. ADL A person with mild restriction would normally be able to dress independently, including managing but tons, and put on socks and shoes, using simple technical aids if required. The ability to rise from sitting, attend to own toilet needs and prepare a main meal would not be impaired to any significant degree. Such a person would normally be expected to be capable of maintaining personal hygiene. They would have little or no functional limitation on a day -to- day basis arising from any symptoms and would not need supervision or watching over. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Uppe r Limb - Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of restriction may experience persistent swelling (effusions) of their fingers, shoulder, elbow and/or wrist. Deformity of some or all of these joints may be present, together with reduced range of movement. Pain and joint stiffness would be present on rising in the morning, or following prolonged inactivity, for up to one hour. Painful and/or restricted neck movements may occur, but without any neurological signs (pins and needles) in the arms. However, there may be periods of \"flare - ups\" when increased help is needed with self -care. A \"flare - up\" typically lasts between 10 to 14 days. Mobility A person with moderate restriction would normally h ave no physical difficulty in getting around. Nor would they require guidance or supervision. ADL A person with moderate restriction may need help with getting out of bed, and with dressing and washing. Reliance on simple kitchen aids and prescribed ass istive equipment such as dressing aids or the occasional use of splints is probable . The ability to care for themselves during the majority of the day however, including preparing a main meal for one, would not be significantly restricted. They would not need supervision or watching over. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Upper Limb - Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction would experience gross joint deformity and/or restriction of joint movements. They may be on the waiting list for shoulder, elbow or wrist replacement surgery, or for surgery to realign or replace a finger or thumb. Pain and/or joint stiffness would be present for up to two hours afte r rising, and may affect the person during the night. Painful and/or restricted neck movements may occur accompanied by neurological signs (pins and needles) in the arms . Mobility A person with severe restriction may need physical assistance from another person in getting around due to difficulty in gripping and/or holding prescribed mobility aids. They would not require guidance or supervision. ADL A person with severe restriction would need help with getting out of bed, dressing and washing, attending to toilet needs and preparing a main meal. Due to deformity, weakness of muscles, ligaments and tendons, grip would be significantly impaired. Some people may experience further impairment of grip and upper limb function due to loss of sensation and 'pins and needles' in the arms. These problems may lead to an inability to adequately grip crutches or other mobility aids, making any mobility restriction worse. Such a person may need assistance with getting out of bed, help with dressing and washing and help with attending to toilet needs. They may need someone to assist in rising from a chair and with cutting up certain foods and with main meal preparation. They would not need supervision or watching over. Back to top of section How long will needs last? Duration of functional limitations will depend on the length of time the person has had Rheumatoid Arthritis. Impairment Date of Onset Award Period Rheumatoid arthritis Less than 4 years More than 4 years 2 year award Indefinite award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Rheumatoid Arthritis in people over 65 Although the most frequent age of onset is 35 to 55 years, RA not infrequently occurs for the first time in older people, up to age 70 and older. Clinical features are similar to those in a younger age group. Usuall y the onset is insidious with development of joint stiffness and swelling over several months. In about a quarter of people, the onset takes place more rapidly, over a period of days or weeks, and is associated with more generalised symptoms that may incl ude night sweats and fever. Some people with RA have a decline in disease activity and are left with residual disability due to joint damage. In others, the disease remains active and they continue to develop new nodules and associated sequelae of RA, su ch as vasculitis. The principles of treatment are similar to those in younger people. There are some noticeable differences however, and these include: Treatment goals should take into account other disabilities. For example, major joint surgery may not be considered appropriate in elderly people with major deformities of the feet or other problems that preclude eventual walking or independence. Treatment goals may need to be scaled down in people with significant cognitive impairment. Many people m ay be depressed, and this may require treatment in its own right. Undernutrition is a common problem and requires careful assessment and treatment. Social support and the provision of assistive equipment and environmental modifications should take high p riority.

A simple arithmetical approach to how much attention/supervision is given to a person on a daily basis may under estimate considerably the amount of care and/or supervision the person actually needs, especia lly if that care is not readily available to the individual. Schizophrenia may develop in a middle -aged person (30 to 50 years) when the main symptom is one of delusions of persecution. They believe that other people, including family and friends, are trying to harm them. This can lead to hostility and an aggressive attitude towards others. These delusions may be of a circumscribed nature only, i.e. that others are trying to harm them, and respond to medication. The person is less likely to be affected by the negative symptoms of the condition and carries on with the majority of the usual tasks of daily life. He or she is unlikely to have any long-term requirement for care or supervision. People whose behaviour is very disturbed may put themselves or ot hers at risk. Supervision by day and night might be required in some cases. The most severely disturbed are likely to be admitted to hospital. People, who are stable on medication once the acute episode is treated, are unlikely to require supervision at n ight. A history of suicide attempts would increase the need for supervision. A suicide attempt is more likely in someone who has been acutely disturbed and whose treatment is not fully controlling the symptoms. The risk might be greatest after a recent ho spital discharge, and especially in those with newly diagnosed schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia should not have a physical difficulty in walking. Side effects of drugs causing stiffness of muscles and involuntary movements may affect the lower li mbs, but not to such an extent that walking is severely limited. People with schizophrenia may need supervision or guidance out of doors as a result of poor concentration, impaired thought processes, odd behaviour and social withdrawal. Problems may occur if people are very disturbed or deluded, although this situation should be short lived when medication is used to control such symptoms. Some people may engage in inappropriate conversations with total strangers, or be so socially withdrawn they would be unable to ask someone else for directions or help. Many people however with moderate schizophrenia well controlled on medication who live in the community are able to find their way around with little difficulty. The following tables present pen pictures of customers' likely mobility and care needs at varying levels of functional severity. Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects Many people with this level of functional restriction would not have any noticeable disabilities on an everyday basis. Their mood would be normal; they would be alert and orientated with no evidence of confusion, memory loss, poor concentration, disordered thinking or impaired judgement. Symptoms of anxiety or panic arising from the schiz ophrenia would be unlikely to be prominent or cause any functional limitation. Limb function would be normal. Mobility People with this level of restriction would, for example normally have no difficulty finding their way around outdoors because they do n ot usually experience any confusion, inattention, memory loss or impaired judgement. Physical walking ability is unaffected. ADL People with this level of restriction would, for example normally be expected to care for themselves by maintaining personal h ygiene and preparing meals etc. They would have little or no functional limitation on a day-to-day basis arising from any symptoms nor would they need supervision or watching over to prevent abnormal or untoward behaviour. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction may experience hallucinations, delusions and disordered thinking such that they are unable to initiate and complete the usual tasks of daily living. Insight into their medical condition may be limited and the need for treatment denied. Self - neglect, social isolation and/or social withdrawal may occur. Confusion, incoherent speech, decreased memory and impaired judgement may be present. Symptoms of anxiety and panic disorder may occur as part of the schizophrenic illness. Limb function would be normal. Mobility People with this level of restriction would, for example display inattention, confusion, incoherent speech, memory loss, impaired judgement and anxiety and p anic disorder which would indicate that they may need guidance or supervision outdoors. Physical walking ability is unaffected. ADL People with this level of restriction would, for example need to be encouraged to initiate and complete activities of daily living e.g. they may need to be told and encouraged to get up, wash, dress and prepare meals to maintain a reasonable standard of hygiene and nutrition. They may have support mechanisms in place to maintain a stable routine for the person to prevent relap se and exacerbations of symptoms or need to be reminded and encouraged to attend a day center, hospital or psychiatric clinic appointments. They may need to be encouraged to participate in social and leisure activities to reduce social withdrawal and isola tion, need help with communication, correspondence and financial matters or need someone to supervise their medication. Some supervision indoors due to inattention, confusion, incoherent speech, memory loss and impaired judgement may be required. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects Hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder may impair ability to carry out normal tasks of daily living. The person may be disorientated, confused, have poor concentration and loss of memory. Speech may be unintelligible. At times, behaviour may be bizarre, anti social and, very occasionally, hostile or aggressive. Some people may be very withdrawn and apathetic with minimal social interaction such that self -neglect is severe. Insigh t into the illness may be very limited. Mobility People with this level of functional restriction would, for example display inattention, confusion, incoherent speech, memory loss and impaired judgement, which is likely to indicate that they would need guidance or supervision outdoors. They would perhaps exhibit antisocial, bizarre or occasionally hostile or aggressive behaviour, which is likely to indicate that they would need guidance or supervision outdoors. Physical walking ability is unaffected . ADL People with this level of restriction would need, for example help to initiate and complete activities of daily living e.g. they may need to be told and encouraged to get up, wash, dress and prepare meals in order to maintain reasonable standard of hygiene and nutrition. Need regular contact to prevent self-neglect and a decline into apathetic behaviour. If not encouraged, the customer may lie in bed all day and do nothing, or engage in aimless, repetitive activities. They would need be reminded and encouraged to attend day hospital, day center, hospital and psychiatric clinic appointments. Help in communicating with others including correspondence and financial matters. Need to be encouraged to interact with other people, to participate in social and leisure activities to reduce social withdrawal and isolation. They would have support mechanisms in place to maintain a stable routine and environment to prevent relapse or exacerbation of symptoms and need supervision from a carer to reduce ris ks of self -harm to themselves, and occasionally others. They would need encouragement to eat or drink and require supervised medication. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? A good recovery from an acute episode of schizophrenia may occur with treatment. The person may not have had any long term disabling effects. A similar situation may occur for those who have infrequent relapses, perhaps once every few years, which respond well to treatment. A limited award w ould be appropriate in cases where the Decision Maker considers that the person qualifies for benefit. It is suggested that each case is discussed with medical services. Development of paranoid schizophrenia in a middle -aged person may not necessarily be associated with any long -term requirement for care or supervision. It is a circumscribed condition that can usually be controlled by medication. The following features are likely to indicate long -term disability: Insidious onset at a young age with social withdrawal, loss of motivation, thought disorder and suspicious paranoid state. Long term prescription of medication, in particular depot preparations. Presence of extra -pyramidal side effects. History of relapses. History of multiple hospital admissions. In sheltered or supervised accommodation. On going care from a mental health team and enhanced Care Plan Approach (CPA) status. Previous sections of the Mental Health Act . Some people with Schizophrenia will show no or minimal improvement in their care and mobility needs while others will make a significant recovery. Recovery, if it is going to occur, will take place within 5 years of the ons et of the illness. Impairment Date of Onset Award Period Schizophrenia Less than 5 years Limited award of up to 5 years - suggest discuss each case with Medical Services More than 5 years Indefinite award Schizoaffective disorder Less than 5 years Limited award of up to 5 years - suggest discuss each case with Medical Services More than 5 years Indefinite award All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Schizophrenia in people over 65 The term \"late p araphrenia\" is often used to describe the most common psychotic illness in people over 60 years of age. Although relatively uncommon, the true incidence is not known. In late paraphrenia, delusions are usually persecutory, but differ from schizophrenia in younger people in that they are more mundane. For example, the person is more likely to complain that the neighbours are trying to kill him or her, rather than alleging a plot by aliens. Hallucinations are also common. They are usually a uditory, but tactile and olfactory hallucinations can occur. Visual hallucinations are rare. Personality deterioration can occur, but less frequently than in schizophrenia in younger people. Although late paraphrenia is the most common presentation of ps ychotic illness in people over 60, other presentations may include: Paranoid schizophrenia with symptoms identical to those in younger people. A mixed depressive and schizophrenic illness. Paranoid states proceeding rapidly to dementia. In late paraphrenia, between 50 and 75 percent of people have a full or partial response to antipsychotic medication. Although it is unusual for delusions to completely resolve, they are often reduced to a level where the person can function normally. People with late paraphrenia are often reluctant to commence treatment, and many require admission to hospital to start medication. Schizoaffective disorder (an equal mixture of schizophrenia and mood disorder or schizophrenic illness followed by a mood disorder or vice versa) occurs in people over 65. The outcome is less favourable than for depressive illness. The treatment is the same as that for younger people.

Read more about award duration Over 65's Many elderly people may have severe or late disease and a factor for poor prognosis in this condition is advanced age. What evidence is available? The claimant and / or carer should be able to provide the information required to accurately assess mobility and care needs. However, if further detai ls are needed the General Practitioner , Consultant or Specialist Scleroderma / Rheumatology nurse is an appropriate source of information. All treatment is based on presenting symptoms. Typically the diagnosis will be made and th e care will be managed by a Rheumatologist and team, but other specialists may well be involved, depending on what specific areas of the body are affected. A Dermatologist, Cardiologist, Renal Physician, Respiratory Physician and/ or Gastroenterologist may be involved. The Specialist Nurse Specialist nurses are hospital based in scleroderma / rheumatology units to offer a holistic approach to care. These nurses work to meet the medical and psychological needs of the patients. Their roles comprise mainly: Clinical Work (monitoring clinical condition and medication) Education of patients & health professionals Patient advocacy & support Liaison & Coordination of care (referral to appropriate specialist for follow up care: occupational therapist , gastroenterologist, pulmonary physician, renal physicians, mental health professionals etc) Research & audit Since scleroderma is so variable, they provide personalised care plans and reassessment e specially during times of rapid deterioration. They provide vital support in coping with this chronic illness and are extremely important for the well being of scleroderma patients. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Liv ing and Mobility needs Disabling Effects of Scleroderma The disabling effects of scleroderma vary widely depending on the type of disease and its manifestations. The main disabling effects are due to limb involvement, particularly contractures and ulcera tion of digits. Later in the course of systemic disease, significant effort tolerance limitation may occur due to pulmonary hypertension. Condition Manifestations Disabling effects Localised Scleroderma a.) Localised Morphea One to several patches of scleroderma (thickened skin) Affects only the skin and subcutaneous fat Can occur all over the body, but usually affects trunk Effects are cosmetic (psychological) - there are no care or mobility needs. Localised Scleroderma b.) Generalised Morphoea Less common More severe Large patches thick tight skin affecting trunk, arms and legs. Rarely, if the morphea is extensive, respiration may be affected (therefore exercise tolerance and mobility) If there is joint involvement, there may be contractures which would reduce mobility (lower limbs) and use of upper limb(s) Carpal tunnel syndrome may occur if wrist area affected Localised Scleroderma c.) Linear Scleroderma Usually presents in childhood (<14 years) Highly visible bands of thick tight skin Follows distribution of skin dermatomes and can damage structures down to bones and joints. \"En coup de sabre\" deformity, patients may have seizures , headaches, trigeminal neuralgia, muscle weakness, hemiparesis and visual changes . Both sides often affected Occurrence in children often leads to severely affected limb growth. Disabling effects would depend on the extent and type of lesion Peripheral nerve involvement may occur Mobility may be restricted Systemic Scleroderma a.) Limited Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (Crest Syndrome) Accounts for at least 60% of cases Long history of Raynaud's Phenomenon (see below) Skin changes involve hands, face, feet and forearms Also known as CREST High incidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension arising around 10 years following diagnosis Raynaud's phenomenon can affect manual dexterity. Further complications such as ulceration of extremities, loss of tips of fingers, contractures and sclerodactyly also impair manual dexterity, and therefore may affect many aspects of self-care and meal preparation. Additionally, coping with bowel incontinence if present, may prove difficult with dexterity problems. Fatigue is a major symptom that can limit quality of life. Pulmonary arterial hypertension may affect exercise tolerance and therefore reduce mobility. There may be difficulties with eating because o f small, tight mouth, lack of saliva, loose teeth and swallowing problems. Systemic Scleroderma b.) Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (33% of cases) Rapid onset Diffuse swelling and stiffness of fingers leads to sclerosis followed by involvement of the trunk. Raynaud's disease may develop later Systemic features (kidneys, lungs, heart, and gastrointestinal system) Skin disease rapidly progresses Joint, muscle and bone involvement As in the limited cutaneous form, manual dexterity can be affected (see above for effects) Joint involvement may lead to contractures which would reduce mobility (lower limbs) and use of the upper limbs Fatigue, kidney failure , pulmonary hypertension , cardiac involvement may all lead to reduced exercise tolerance, and subsequent care and mobility needs . Systemic scleroderma 3) Scleroderma sine scleroderma (Less than 2%) No skin changes May have Raynaud's Phenomenon Complications of lungs, heart, kidneys or gastrointestinal system. As above Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Scleroderma is a chronic condition, for which there is no cure and no change likely. Once the ca re and mobility needs are established any award would be likely to be indefinite. There is an increased mortality risk which persists for around 15 years. The localised type of disease (that is, the Morphea or Linear forms) does not change into the syste mic form and the disease is generally not so severe. In Limited Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis the condition has less severe internal organ involvement and the 10 year survival rate is 70%. However, death can occur later in the disease from pulmonary arteri al hypertension (15% develop this). In Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis there is often severe internal organ involvement and many patients die from kidney, heart or lung complications. The 10 year survival is 55%. The prognosis is worst for those who exhibit early symptoms and signs of kidney, heart or lung damage, however, some patients may do well.

Many people with sickle cell anaemia attend hospitals that specialise in the condition, where a multi disciplinary team provide advice on all physical, psychological, social and genetic aspects of the disorder. Others who do not live near a specialist centre attend the haematology cli nic of the local hospital. Some people are routinely advised to attend the hospital clinic for treatment in the event of a painful crisis. Doctors and specialist nurses working in hospital clinics are able to provide medical reports for people who attend hospital for the majority of their treatments and regular monitoring. People with milder disease including those who have infrequent crises or few health problems may be solely under the care of general practitioners from whom medical reports may be obtai ned. It may be helpful to obtain a HCP medical examination report for people with stable or uncomplicated disease, who have little no regular contact with their medical attendants, or for whom there are no recent medical reports. Medical Services can pro vide advice about people who have less common types of sickle cell disorders and thalassaemias, in which the clinical presentations and disabling effects differ from those found in classical sickle cell anaemia. Back to to p of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Mild functional restriction Moderate functional restriction Severe functional restriction Mild functional restriction People in the followings categories are likely to have minimal or mild functional restrictions only -: Occasional or infrequent crises only Able to manage crises at home themselves, or with some input from the general practitioner or community nurse Full recovery after crises and return to normal activities Haemoglobin levels within normal range, or mild anaemia only, for majority of time Not under regular hospi tal care Sickle cell anaemia without complications During a crisis a person is likely to be confined to bed for up to a week, and would be expected to return to normal activities within seven to ten days. People with mild functional restrictions are unl ikely to require any long - term help with self -care, nor are they restricted in their ability to walk. Constant watching over does not prevent sickle cell crises occurring, and people would usually be able to seek assistance if needed, when a crisis was dev eloping. Moderate functional restriction People in the followings categories are likely to have moderate functional restrictions, in particular as long term complications of sickle cell anaemia develop -: Frequent painful crises (2 or more per month) - full recovery between crises less likely and more potent analgesics taken most of the time. Persistent moderate to severe anaemia (haemoglobin level - 50% of normal or less 6 -8g/dl ) between crises Arthritis of the joints of the upper and/or lower limbs and persistent bone pain requiring regular medication Avascular necrosis of the hip and/or shoulder joint. Regular admission to hospital for treatment or need for frequent regular clinic attendance to maintain stable condition People with persistent leg ulcers requiring regular treatment Recovering from a stroke People with moderate functional restrictions may need some help with self-care and preparations of meals. The activities of people with moderate to severe anaemia will be limite d by fatigue and shortness of breath, and tasks may take longer to complete. The ability to walk may be restricted due to arthritis of the hip joint and/or other joints in the lower limbs. Painful leg ulcers may impede walking, and anaemia causing fatigue and shortness of breath may also limit the distance covered. Severe functional restriction Severe functional restrictions are likely to be present when people are limited by the combined effects of a number of the complications described above under mode rate functional restriction. In addition the following conditions restrict capacity -: Severe arthritis affecting both upper and lower limbs Bilateral hip and shoulder deformity due to avascular necrosis, especially if not amenable to joint replacement su rgery Persistent neurological deficits following stroke or cerebral haemorrhage Seizures and epilepsy Long term lung damage, including chronic pulmonary hypertension, causing more severe shortness of breath Enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy) and heart failure Renal failure People with severe functional restrictions are likely to need help with all aspects of self -care including washing, dressing, bathing, rising from a chair, moving around the house, with the toilet, on stairs, administering medicatio n, maintaining nutrition and fluid intake. Severe lower limb arthritis or long term neurological deficits after stroke are likely to cause considerable restriction in walking, and people with these problems may be prone to falls. The majority of adults wi th mild to moderate sickle cell disease have normal cognitive function and are unlikely to require supervision in the home or out of doors. 20% of adults have some level of cognitive impartment related to infarcts; the most likely impairment is learning difficulty. Constant watching over does not prevent sickle cell crises occurring and people would usually be able to seek medical assistance when a crisis was developing. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Early diagnosis and treatment, especially of infection, improves prognosis. In developing countries with inadequate medical services babies with sickle cell anaemia frequently die within the first two years of life. In the UK diagnosis of sick cell anaemia and initiation of treatment is usual in the first year of life. The aim of treatment is for the child to lead a normal life, attend school and enter adulthood with few or no complications of the disease. However, up to 8% of children have had strok es by the age of 14 years. A higher number of children are at risk of stroke and will be treated with regular blood transfusions to prevent it. In adults the condition may be relatively static over the years. However some people experience progressive de terioration with frequent crises, the development of disabling complications and poor general health. The prognosis has improved in recent years and people with sickle cell anaemia can expect to live into their fifties and beyond.

Somatoform disorders are disorders where the person has physical symptoms that have no obvious physical explanation and in which emotional or psychological factors are important contributors. Somatoform disorders include conversi on disorder, somatisation disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder and pain disorder. Somatoform disorders are relatively common but the exact prevalence is difficult to determine. What evidence is available? In cases of moderate and severe somatoform disorders it is highly probable that a consultant psychiatrist will have been involved in the management and treatment of the individual. Indeed the absence of any documented history of a psychiatric consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if required. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs The extent of functional restriction is dependent upon the nature and severity of the phy sical symptoms. Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a mild functional restriction are likely to: Have minor physical symptoms that do not affect day to day functioning Be under GP care only Live independently in the community Never have attended pain clinic (if they suffer from a painful condition) Not use aids or adaptations Mobility They would normally have no physical difficulty in getting around. They should not have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and should not require guidance. ADL They should not normally have any significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day -to-day activities. Moderate Functiona l Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a moderate functional restriction are likely to: Have moderate physical symptoms that have some effect on day to day functioning Be (or have been) under the care of the community mental health team or be (or have been) under the care of another specialist e.g. neuropsychiatrist or neurologist or be (or have been) under the care of a hospital or community based disability team Live at home and have been assessed as requiring twice daily supervision Have attended pain clinic (if they suffer from a painful condition) Use aids or adaptations Mobility They may have physical difficulty in getting around. They are unlikely to have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and should not require guidance. ADL They may have a significant functional loss that may result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day -to-day activities, the extent of which will be determined by the severity of their physical sy mptoms. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a severe functional restriction are likely to: Have severe physical symptoms that have a major effect on day to day functioning Attend psychiatric day hospital or be under the care of the community mental health team or be under the care of another specialist e.g. neuropsychiatrist or neurologist or be under the care of a hospital or community based disability team Live in residential care or long term h ospital care or if living at home been assessed as requiring 12 to 24 hour supervision Have attended pain clinic (if they suffer from a painful condition) Use aids or adaptations Mobility They are likely to have physical difficulty in getting around.

Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Conversion disorder Most people with a conversion disorder of recent onset recover quickly. However, if the condition persists for more than a year it is likely to last for many years. Initially therefore, a short term award of 2 years should be considered. Thereafter, an indefinite award should be considered. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Impairment Award period Conversion disorder First award period - 2 year award Further award period - indefinite Somatisation disorder People with somatisation disorder are usually chronically ill for the majority of their lives. They rarely make a full recovery but can make a partial recovery. The degree of disability varies from person to person, insofar as some are able to work but others are chair or bed bound and completely dependent. Initially therefore, a short term award of 2 years should be considered. Thereafter, an indefini te award should be considered. Impairment Award period Somatisation disorder First award period - 2 year award Further award period - indefinite Hypochondriasis Primary hypochondriasis follows a chronic fluctuating course. Treatment may help reduce symptoms but it is rarely curative. Initially therefore, a short term award of 2 years should be considered. Thereafter, an indefinite award should be considered. Hypochondriasis may be secondary to another disorder such as depression, in which cas e it may be relieved by treatment of the depression. The prognosis is determined by the primary disorder. For such cases please refer to the guidance on prognosis for the primary disorder.

However, in the minority of cases where disability may have occurred it may be necessary to request a factual report from the customer's own General Practitioner. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs There are 3 grades describing the degree of the sprain. A mild sprain - there may be minimal pain, slight swelling and little or no loss of functional ability. Bruising is absent or slight and the weight -bearing on the affected joint bearable. A mild sprain may take up to 3 -6 weeks to recover fully. A moderate sprain - there is bruising, moderate pain and swelling. There is usually more difficulty weight -bearing and there could be some loss of function. A moderate sprain taking 2 -3 months. A severe sprain - the pain, swelling and bruising are usually severe and should the sprain affect the lower limb, then weight bearing would be very difficult. A severe sprain can take up to 8 -12 months to regain full function. How long will the needs last? The amount of rehabilitation and the time needed for full recovery after a sprain depends on the severity of the injury and the rate of healing. A mild sprain may take up to 3 -6 weeks to recover fully. A moderate sprain taking 2 -3 months. A severe sprain can take up to 8 -12 months to regain full function. It is unusual, however, for a person not to return to full activities after treatment and rehabilitation.

Community General Practitioner - the family doctor will have information from the hospital on diagnosis and treatment, this may not be up to date. For people who are living at home with disabilities, the GP is likely to have up to date information on how they are. Community or District Nurse - will have information on any home care or outreach package in place as this is coordinated through the practice.

Symptoms of disease may include many of the following: Indigestion, acid indigestion Belching Difficulty swallowing - 'dysphagia' Nausea or vomiting - may be bloody - 'haema temesis' Feeling full after smaller amounts of food than normal, the medical term for this is 'early satiety' Abdominal pain Bleeding from tumours in the lining of the stomach Low blood count - 'anaemia' from gastrointestinal bleeding Loss of appetite - 'anorexia' Weight loss Over time they are likely to lose weight becoming frailer, they may be unable to walk far or cope with shopping and cleaning. In the terminal phase they are likely to require help with all aspects of personal care. Some will respond very well to palliative treatment, maintain weight and be able to function well for some time before entering the terminal phase. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Localised (early stage) stomach cancer This group includes only 20% of those with stomach cancer; they are likely to have had major surgery and possibly a course of chemotherapy. They are likely to be recovered from surgery and any chemotherapy given afterwards within 9 -12 months of starting tr eatment. They may have needs during chemotherapy treatment if side effects of therapy are severe, these should resolve when treatment is complete. In this group ongoing needs are unlikely to be identified unless there are ongoing rare complications from s urgery or chemotherapy treatment. Needs are likely to arise only when disease recurs. The chances of this depend on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Five year survival for stage 1 stomach cancer is 70%, stage 2 40% and stage 3 20%. Of the group who h ave curative treatment less than half (30% to 50%) will survive for 5 years as a whole. When disease recurs refer to guidance for advanced/recurrent disease. In cases where needs are identified during treatment of the primary tumour, awards should be time limited to cover the period of treatment and recovery. A return to health is expected in the typical case. If disease has recurred after successful treatment of any stage of stomach cancer, information relating to the advanced/recurrent disease stage is appropriate. Life awards are recommended even if palliative treatment has appeared to restore health. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the p articular circumstances of the individual claimant.

Note: If considering entitlement to H/R Mobility component under the Severely Visually Impaired (SVI) provisions, the following evidence source must be used: The Consultant Ophthalmologist will be able to provide information about symptoms, signs, investigations including assessment of vision, treatment/management , and is likely to have information about resulting disability or needs. Other evidence sources The claimant and/or carer should be able to provide the information required to accurately assess mobility and care needs. However, if further details are needed, the Specialist Nurse , Physiotherapist , Occupational Therapist or Consultant is an appropriate source of information. If details of peripheral vis ual defect are needed, the Ophthalmologist or Optometrist is an appropriate source of information. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs The overall level of functional re striction will depend upon the number of joints affected and the combination of upper and lower limb involvement. Please click on the appropriate link below to access the relevant care and mobility needs. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility considerat ions (Lower limb) It is important to bear in mind that damage to specific parts or functions of the brain (which may be physically small) may cause disproportionate, and devastating disability. Some examples of this are dysphasia (difficulty with expressi ng and understanding language), hemianopia, and the inability to recognize faces. It is especially true of language loss, which may occur in isolation. A person with aphasia would not be able to speak, read, manage mathematical calculations etc. Spinal cor d strokes may well affect bowel and bladder control. There may be other effects such as: Speech disorders, such as: Dysarthria (poorly articulated speech, caused by problems in muscle control) Aphasia (disorder of the language content of speech, a defect or loss of the ability to comprehend or express words) Anomia (inability to produce the correct word) Dysphonia (hoarse or whispered speech) Hemianopia (loss of half of the visual field) Cognitive function - effect on thinking, awareness of surrou ndings, attention, learning, judgement and memory) Hemianaesthesia (loss of sensation of the affected part) Perceptual problems (lack of awareness of the affected part of the body) Mood disturbances or depression Ataxia (problems with co -ordination, unstea diness) Vertigo (balance disturbance) Problems controlling movements of the eyes Problems with swallowing Problems with bowel and bladder control Vision guidance is available in addition where appropriate. Lower Limb condition - Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction have normal or minimal loss of muscle power, and minimal or no spasticity of the affected lower limb. They are able to stand u naided or with the use of walking stick. Mobility People with such a restriction would normally be able to walk at over two hundred metres at a normal or near normal speed. They would normally have some restriction of lower limb function, causing a mild impairment of gait, such as a mild limp, but they would be unlikely to suffer from falls. ADL People with this level of restriction would normally be able to safely manage all aspects of their personal care, as they would normally have reasonable low er limb muscle power. Such a person would normally be able to independently maintain personal hygiene and prepare and cook a meal. They would have little or no functional limitation on a day -to- day basis arising from any symptoms. Lower Limb condition - Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction would normally be unable to stand unassisted, would have moderate loss of muscle power, and some difficulty in straightening the affected limb. Mobility People with this level of restriction would normally be unable to walk at normal speed. They would normally have an abnormal gait, may have problems with balance and would walk with a noticeable limp. They may nee d physical support, in order to walk. Such people may be able to walk 50 to 100 metres at a slow or very slow speed and they may suffer from falls. ADL A person with this level of restriction may have difficulty coping with many activities of daily life. There may be spasticity of muscles (a state in which the normal tone of the muscle is increased leading to difficulty in movement). In other cases weakness of the muscles may be present. Spasticity and weakness of muscles may also co -exist. Any of th ese problems may cause difficulty with dressing, getting out of a normal chair, out of bed, rising from a toilet and getting out of a bath. There may be difficulty in climbing stairs, safely dealing with hot pans, and bending to the oven. People with such a condition may suffer from falls, and may have difficulty rising independently from a fall. Lower limb condition - Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of functional restriction would normally be unable to stand unsupported, would have severe loss of muscle power, and significant spasticity of the affected lower limb. Mobility Walking would normally be significantly restricted in terms of speed, distance (unable to manage more than 50 metres) and gait. The person would normally be unable to walk without physical support, or the person may be unable to walk at all, or even stand unsupported. There is a significant risk of falls. ADL People with this level of restriction would normally have significant difficulty coping with most activities of daily life. They may be unable to, or have significant difficulty in rising, leading to difficulty or inability to get out of a normal chair, out of bed, rise from the toilet or out of the bath. They would normally have significant difficulty or be unable to climb stairs safely. A risk of falls is likely, and due to muscle weakness or spasticity they would normally be unable to get up following a fall. Where there is upper limb and lower limb and cognitive involvement while each is considered separately when assessing functional restriction it must be borne in mind that the combined effects on a persons ability to self care and get around may be greater than the individual components. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility considerations (Upper limb) It is important to bear in mind that damage to specific parts or functions of the brain (which may be physically small) may cause disproportionate, and devastating disability. Some examples of this are dysphasia (difficulty with expressing and understanding language), hemianopia, and the inability to recognize faces. It is especially true of language loss, which may occur in isolation. A person with aphasia would not be able to speak, read, man age mathematical calculations etc. Spinal cord strokes may well affect bowel and bladder control. There may be other effects such as: Speech disorders, such as: Dysarthria (poorly articulated speech, caused by problems in muscle control) Aphasia (disorde r of the language content of speech, a defect or loss of the ability to comprehend or express words) Anomia (inability to produce the correct word) Dysphonia (hoarse or whispered speech) Hemianopia (loss of half of the visual field) Cognitive function - effect on thinking, awareness of surroundings, attention, learning, judgement and memory) Hemianaesthesia (loss of sensation of the affected part) Perceptual problems (lack of awareness of the affected part of the body) Mood disturbances or depression Ataxia (problems with co -ordination, unsteadiness) Vertigo (balance disturbance) Problems controlling movements of the eyes Problems with swallowing Problems with bowel and bladder control Vision guidance is available in addition where appropriate. Upper Limb condition - Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of restriction would normally have reasonable grip, manual dexterity, and muscle power in the affected arm, and would not be likely to experience spasticity. Mobility A person with mild upper limb stroke would normally have no physical difficulty in getting around and would not require guidance or supervision. ADL People with mild upper limb stroke would normally be able to safely manage all aspects of their personal care. People with this condition would normally be able to safely manage all aspects of their personal care, as they would normally have reasonable grip, manual dexterity, and muscle power in the hands/ arms. They would normally be able to prepare and cook a main meal and would have little functional restriction on a day -to-day basis. Upper Limb condition - Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with this level of restriction may have some restriction of hand function and manual dexterity, as well as weakness of the muscles, and spasticity of the affected upper limb. Mobility Walking aids may help with mobility, but upper limb difficulties may pr eclude their use. ADL A person with this level of restriction would normally have difficulties coping with many activities of daily life. Reduced manual dexterity may lead to difficulty with dressing, including small buttons and fastenings, feeding, wash ing, shaving, toileting, administering medication, medical treatment, and peeling vegetables, which requires good bimanual dexterity. Due to reduced muscle power, though the person would normally be able to turn a sink tap, or control knobs on a cooker, he /she would normally have difficulty handling hot pans. The person would not normally need supervision or watching over. Upper Limb Condition - Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects In a person with this level of restriction manual dexterity and muscle power would normally be severely affected, as well as there being the presence of significant spasticity, of the affected upper limb. Mobility Walking aids are unlikely to be of any use as this person would be likely to have great difficulty in gripping, holding and using any prescribed mobility aids. ADL A person with this level of restriction would normally have great difficulty in coping with most activities of daily life. They may have difficulty getting out of bed. They would normally have significant difficulty with or inability to: feed, wash, shave, get in or out of a bath, dress, manage buttons and fastenings, attend to toilet needs, and administer medicines or medical treatment. They would normally have difficulty with or inability to cut up food. Because of severe restriction of manual dexterity, and severe loss of muscle power, the preparation of a main meal would not normally be possible. Due to muscle weakness or spasticity, the people may not be able to help themselves up after a fall. Where there is upper limb and lower limb and cognitive involvement while each is considered separately when assessing functional restriction it must be borne in mind that the combined effects on a persons ability to s elf care and get around may be greater than the individual components. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility considerations (cognitive) It is important to bear in mind that damage to specific parts or fun ctions of the brain (which may be physically small) may cause disproportionate, and devastating disability.

Back to top of section Cognitive Function - Mild Functional Restr iction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a mild restriction are likely to have mild cognitive deficit. Mobility People with a mild cognitive impairment would normally be able to find their way around outdoors. ADL People with a mild cognitive impairment would not need supervision or watching over. Cognitive Function - Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a moderate restriction are likely to have moderate cognitive deficit. Mobility People with a moderate cognitive impairment would normally be able to find their way around outdoors. ADL The resulting disability may lead them to require assistance with undertaking complex activities. They may require prompting to prepare food, take medication, deal with correspondence and financial matters and undertake appropriate activities.

Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Rehabilitation following a stroke may take time. Most of a person's recovery will occur within the first 6 months following a stroke, with the majority of this occurring in the first 12 weeks. Improvement may continue for up to one ye ar especially in younger people. After one year from the stroke further recovery is likely to be limited. All cognitive disorders following a stroke are considerable obstacles to successful rehabilitation and independent living. Apraxias are especially disabling. Of those who do not die within a few days following a stroke: 1/3 make a full recovery 1/3 are disabled to some extent 1/3 are severely disabled and dependent In view of the potential for improvement in the first 12 months it would be reasonable to award for a limited period. Impairment Date of Onset (date of stroke) Award Period Stroke / Cerebro vascular accident (CVA) Less than 2 years 2 year award (from date of claim) More than 2 years Indefinite award You may need to consider whether H/R Mob SVI deeming provisions are satisfied. Click on the link H/R Mobility SVI . Transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) The average duration of a TIA is a few minutes with the majority fully resolving within an hour, therefore care and mobility needs are not appropria te. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of sect ion Strokes in people over 65 Effects of Ageing Older people who have strokes usually have atheroma and atherosclerosis in other parts of the body, and are likely to have co -existing peripheral vascular disease, and ischaemic heart disease. Because older people often have a variety of health problems, older people with stroke are more likely to have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), eyesight difficulties, osteo -arthritis and other conditions, which increases their general frailty and vulnerabi lity. General points Stroke risk increases as a person gets older, and 2/3 of stroke victims are over 60 years of age. The same risk factors operate as for those of younger people, however the risk of atrial fibrillation (which causes one sort of stroke - embolic stroke) doubles with each additional decade of age. An older person with stroke is more likely to have suffered previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Older people, as long as they are fit, benefit from procedures such as ca rotid endarterectomy, which is a preventative measure in people who have suffered TIA's or strokes, and reduces the risk of further TIA/ stroke by around 75%. In general, the presentation of a stroke will be the same in older people as for the younger pop ulation, but in some elderly people, the severity of the stroke may be hard to assess because of existing cognitive deficit, communication difficulties, or musculo -skeletal disorders. Diffuse, small vessel disease is very common in older people, particular ly over the age of 70. Because a series of small strokes occurs, there is a gradual and insidious deterioration, rather than a dramatic change, which occurs with other strokes, and it causes problems with gait, speech, or vascular dementia (multi - infarct ). Another preventative measure - warfarin (to prevent embolic stroke from atrial fibrillation), may not be possible in the elderly, if the person has a history of falls, or takes other medication which could interact. Older people may therefore be at a d isadvantage in these circumstances. Though age should not prevent recovery from a stroke, full recovery and rehabilitation may not be possible, and the person's needs may not be fully met, if the person is frail, has other disabling physical and mental conditions, social isolation, and transport difficulties.

In cases of moderate and severe substance abuse it is highly probable that the community drug team will have been involved in the management and treatment of the individual. Indeed the absence of any documented history of their involvement should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if required from the community drug team. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Mild Functional Restriction Moderate Functional Restriction Severe Functional Restriction Many people abuse drugs and experience only minor mental, physical or social disability. Substance dependence in the absence of chronic physical or mental complications should not be expected to give rise to significant care and mobility needs. Episodes of acute intoxication on their own cannot be prevented by reasonable supervision, although intermittent intervention by another person at specific times may reduce the risk at those times. Withdrawal symptoms usually last for several days only and should not require long term help from another person. Self neglect in people with substance dependency in the absence of chronic physical or mental complications may require short -term help from another person. However, such help should not be long term once substance use has been discontinued. During periods of rehabilitation the person may require support from others but this should not amount to a need for attention or supervisi on. The onset of chronic physical or mental complications is likely to imply moderate or severe disability. Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a mild functional restriction are likely to be those who have some of the following -: Use drugs recreationally only Have no symptoms of dependence Have no associated psychiatric symptoms Have no associated physical problems Have no associated social problems Have had no hospital admissions for drug dependency Live a t home Not be on care plan Be under GP care only Mobility They should not have any physical problem with walking. They should not have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and should not require guidance or supervision. ADL They would not normally exhibit significant self -neglect and would not normally put themselves or others at risk of danger. They should not normally have any significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day -to- day activities. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects People with a moderate functional restriction are likely to be those who have some of the following -: Have been drug dependent for <10 years Have non psychotic psychiatric symptoms Have mild or moderate physical problems, for example local complications or non -disabling systemic complications. Have mild or moderate social problems, for example relationship problems, work related problems, unemployment and engagement in criminal activity. Have had no hospital admissions in the last 12 months Live at home or in be in short term residential accommodation Be under the care of the community drug team or GP with special interest in substance misuse with or without social services involvement. Mobility They should not have any physical problem with walking. They are unlikely to have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and are unlikely to require guidance or supervision. ADL They would not normally exhibit significant self -neglect and would not normally put themselves or others at risk of danger. They may have difficulty in carrying out normal day -to-day activities in a timely fashion, due to, for example, impaired concentration a nd motivation. For example they may require encouragement to prepare meals, take medication (but this is likely to be limited to once or twice a day) and get out and about, but this is unlikely to be a long term need. Severe Functional Restriction Categ ory Description Disabling Effects People with a severe functional restriction are likely to be those who have some of the following -: Have been drug dependent for >10 years Use multiple drugs Have persistent severe psychiatric symptoms. Have severe physical problems, for example chronic liver failure secondary to hepatitis or moderate or severe disability secondary to HIV/AIDs Have had hospital admissions in the last 12 months Be socially isolated and have a chaotic and disorganised lifestyle Have persistent self neglect Have bizarre behaviour towards other people Live in long term residential accommodation or homeless Be under the care of specialist substance misuse services (the community drug team) with or without involvement from social services Mobility They may have difficulty walking if they have a severe drug related physical problem such as leg ulceration or other vascular complications from injecting drug misuse, e.g. chronic deep vein thrombosis, amputations etc. They may have difficulty finding their way around unfamiliar places and may require guidance or supervision. ADL They may exhibit significant self - neglect and may put themselves or others at risk of danger. They may have a significant functional loss that will result in a reduction of their ability to carry out normal day -to-day activities. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? For people with drug dependence problems, there is no quick solution and no 'cure' for drug a buse. The eventual outcome of drug abuse is, like its initiation, dependent on the unique interaction between drug, individual and society in addition to the treatment intervention. Once dependence has developed, it is generally a chronic condition of rela pse and remission lasting for years rather than months and one that is difficult but not impossible to overcome. Studies have shown that it is the less chronic addicts who are likely to become abstinent in the short term, and that short -term or early improvement is more likely to lead to long -term improvement. Most of the studies looking at deaths of people with addiction problems report that 2 -3% of addicts are dead within one year of making contact with a clinic or helping agency. Several f actors determine the prognosis for any individual. These include: The substance of abuse. Substances that have high rates of dependence and severe or prolonged withdrawal symptoms are associated with a worse prognosis. The reasons for the substance abus e. Teenage experimentation or drug abuse during reversible life crises is associated with a good prognosis. Personal vulnerability. Poor family background, poor school record and truancy, thrill seeking, impulsivity and personality disorders are associa ted with a worse prognosis. Associated psychiatric disorders. People with associated psychiatric disorders, for example people with depression, schizophrenia and personality disorders tend to have a worse prognosis Multiple substance or alcohol abuse is a ssociated with a worse prognosis Poor social environment, for example homelessness and unemployment is associated with a poor prognosis. The duration of the substance abuse. A worse prognosis is associated with longer duration of substance abuse. Motivati on of the person to change. Lack of motivation is associated with a worse prognosis. Support available to the person. Lack of availability of support services are associated with a worse prognosis. The prognosis for certain specific individual substance s is briefly described below. Amphetamines Cannabis Heroin and other opioids Nitrites acid diethylamid e (LSD) Solvents (volatile substances) Amphetamines Amphetamine use is more likely to be recreational than opioid use. It is thought that the vast majority of young adults give them up in due course. A very small proportion of amphetamine injector's progress to high dose daily usage. Complications and contact with psychiatric services is more likely in dependent users and in episodes of psychosis. The prognosis is good provided the person abstains from drug use after any related psychiatric disorder occurs. The prognosis is worse in people with associated personal or social difficulties or psychiatric disorder including personality disorder. Anabolic steroids The prognosis is not known because no long -term follow up or large treatment trials are available. Barbiturates The prognosis is not known because no trials or long term follow up studies are available. Benzodiazepines Success rates for supervised withdrawal are high. Of those people who participate in supervised withdrawal programmes, about half complete a programme and of these, half to two thirds remain benzodiazepine free after 1 to 3 years. A few people continue to experience withdrawal like symptoms for mont hs or even years after cessation of benzodiazepines (prolonged withdrawal syndrome). A considerable proportion of people may temporarily take benzodiazepines again and some may need other psychotropic medication. Cannabis The vast majority of users do no t abuse the drug or become dependent on it. The 12 month prevalence rate of cannabis abuse in general population is 0.7% and 6% of those who used cannabis in the past year are dependent. Only a minority of people seek treatment from a health professional. Post treatment abstinence rates are low. Cocaine Cocaine use is more likely to be recreational than opioid use. It is thought that the vast majority of young adults give them up in due course. Heavy use of cocaine is difficult to sustain and its use te nds to be periodic in nature. Success rates for treatment of cocaine abuse are high with up to 75% abstinence at 5 years post treatment. The prognosis is worse in people with associated personal or social difficulties or psychiatric disorder including per sonality disorder. Good prognosis is associated with longer treatment programmes and in women. Due to the recent increased availability of crack cocaine, there are increasing numbers of cases of very severe dependence with a corresponding very distressing abstinence syndrome. Crack cocaine use seems to be associated with a high mortality rate and criminal involvement and treatment does not appear to be effective in reducing drug use. Ecstasy The prognosis is good provided the person abstains from drug us e. The prognosis is worse in people with associated personality disorders. Gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) There is insufficient evidence available to comment on the prognosis following treatment. Heroin and other opioids There is a significant mortality (10 to 15%) over 10 years in opioid abusers. Common causes of death include accidental overdose, suicide, HIV and hepatitis. Abstinence rates following treatment vary but between 10 to 40% are abstinent 6 months following treatment and the majority of people who relapse do so 3 to 4 months after discharge. Good prognosis is associated with a greater range of treatment services (health care, family therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy etc) and substantial periods of employment and marriage . Worse prognosis is associated with more severe pre -treatment psychopathology and dependence. Abstinence is often related to change in life circumstance, for example in opiate addicted returning Vietnam veterans. Approximately 50% abstinence has been re ported at 10 year follow up. It has been demonstrated that eventual cessation of opiate use is a very slow process and becomes increasingly unlikely the longer the person has taken the drug. Ketamine The vast majority of people stop using ketamine withou t treatment as the psychedelic effects diminish as tolerance develops. Khat There is insufficient evidence available to comment on the prognosis following treatment. Lysergic acid diathylemide (LSD) The long term prognosis for LSD abuse is good provide d that the person discontinues use of the drug. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder may resolve over a period of months or years after last drug use but persists in about 50%. Prolonged psychotic episodes have a relatively poor prognosis and there is a high risk of suicide. Nitrites (Poppers) The prognosis is not known because there are no available treatment trials or long -term follow up studies. Phencyclidine (angel dust) The majority of people stop taking phencyclidine once they pass young adulthood. The prognosis for chronic phencyclidine psychosis is poor. Psilocybe mushrooms Users do not usually regard themselves as having a problem and almost never present to drug services for help with cutting down or stopping. Solvents For many users , experimentation is a temporary phase which does not result in persistent abuse or dependence. However, treatment is difficult for the dependent subgroup with associated personality disorder and chaotic social circumstances. All substances Therefore the following awards should be considered -: Impairment Award Period Substance (drug) abuse First award - 2 year award Second award - 5 year award Subsequent award - Indefinite award However, in some cases there is potential for improvement in the condition in the longer term. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Over 65 Substance abuse occurs in older people, but less frequently than in younger people. Benzodiazepines are the most common drugs of dependence in the elderly. Dependence is usually the resul t of long -term prescription, rather than illicit use. Major adverse effects include daytime sedation, unsteadiness, mood disturbance and cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment may present as memory difficulties and continual use may result in a dement ia like syndrome. Benzodiazepine use increases the risk of falls and hip fracture. Driving skills may be impaired. Memory and other cognitive functions improve after discontinuation of long term benzodiazepine treatment. Elderly people are less likely to withdraw from benzodiazepines and are more likely to relapse after withdrawal than younger people. Abuse of prescribed opiates by elderly people is uncommon unless the person was an opioid abuser when younger. Elderly people who become dependent on prescribed opioids tend to have significant psychiatric problems. Although use of illicit drugs is uncommon in elderly people, use of over the counter preparations is common and can result in medical and psychological problems. For example, chronic aspir in ingestion can result in a dementia like syndrome with tinnitus and irritability. There is clearly a rise in the number of drug mis -users maintained over a long period of time on substitute medications e.g. Methadone. It is not unusual for clinicians th ese days to be caring for an older drug using population including patients in their 60's or older. Older drug mis -users may also have special health needs. Overdose death incidence can be represented as a U -shaped curve, most common in the young and older age groups. There are many reasons why increasing age may affect the individual vulnerability to the effects of drugs (prescribed or non -prescribed) and alcohol. Health problems resulting from prolonged drug use (including tobacco and cannabis) and alcohol can exacerbate the decline in health that older adults already experience. Loneliness, loss of loved ones, or a declining sense of purpose can also lead older adults to return to drugs they used casually as younger people or to alcohol. Advanced age, frailty and an increased need for prescription medications are all factors that contribute to the patient's risks of developing a drug related problem.

Management of lupus is ideally multidisciplinary, involving the Consultant Rheumatologist, Specialist Nurse , Physiotherapist and Occupational Therapist . In many areas of the country there are now Lupus Nurse Specialists, whose role is to provide advice, counselling, education and information. This is important at initial diagnosis and at times of acute flare. Advice lines provide contact with Specialist units. The patient and family are able to have consultations with the Specialist Nurse and discuss the condition, and management options in detail. The disease varies fro m person to person and their needs may include rehabilitative treatment. Graded exercise programmes help improve cardiovascular fitness and in some cases reduce fatigue. This is through Physiotherapy assessment. The Occupational Therapist, after assessmen t, helps the person manage their fatigue and the impact on their activities of daily living. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Note: The disabling effects are only considered here for the condition of SLE itself and not with regard to the complications. Disabling effects would be due to -: Fatigue, fever, malaise & weight loss Joint pain Organ complications Skin complications If serious organ failure occurs, such as in the heart, lungs or kidneys, those effects must be considered separately. In mild disease there will be few or no disabling effects, as the consequences of the disease would not affec t the person's ability to look after him/herself or get about. However, fatigue and malaise may limit physical activities. In active disease, fatigue and morning stiffness can affect self -care and mobility but with treatment, it is unusual for significan t care / mobility needs to arise. Flare ups can vary from person to person and the intensity and length of the flare ups depends on the individual's response to the disease and the treatment. The course of SLE varies and is unpredictable, the systems invo lved vary from person to person and the involvement can be as follows: Fatigue, fever, malaise and weight loss Are all universal symptoms of lupus. Fatigue may be mild in chronic SLE and not affect the person's ability to self -care and get about, to any extent. However, severe fatigue, which accompanies a flare -up of the disease, may affect the person's ability to self -care and get about, a great deal. The needs which a person may have, depends on how long the flare - ups last, how controlled the condition is and what the complications of the disease are. Joint pain -: Moderate joint symptoms can mimic early rheumatoid arthritis, but tends not to be erosive, unlike rheumatoid arthritis. However, tendons and ligaments can be affected, and that can impact on daily activities. This may affect peeling and chopping vegetables, managing buttons and small fastenings, handling medications, injections etc. Joint pain may be severe, and mobility may be affected to a variable degree. Occasionally, some people may have destructive disease such as avascular necrosis of the hip, (which is the term for the ischaemia and death of the bone which may occur after injury. The neck of the femur is one of the bones of the body particularly susceptible to this occurrence). This c omplication would cause significant pain and affect mobility. Jaccoud's Arthropathy may occur in a small percentage of people (It is a deformity of the fingers and thumb which is a consequence of tendon inflammation and damage ). In these cases the effects (dressing, hygiene, vegetable preparation, and the ability to manage boiling water) are due to this complication. Details for -: Rheumatoid Arthritis Organ Complications -: Central Nervous System - the person may develop milder symptoms such as migraine, depression, damage to a single nerve in the arm or leg, or more severe symptoms such as psychosis, fits, stroke, and other neurological complications. Disabling effects would be likely to be a consequence of compl ication, and may be very significant Kidney - Kidney disease is often rapidly progressive and difficult to control, leading to kidney failure. Again, any disabling effects will be as a result of kidney failure, or the need for dialysis, or transplant Heart and Lungs - Pericarditis, damage to the heart muscle itself or the coronary arteries, pleurisy and restrictive lung disease (pulmonary fibrosis) may all be a consequence of the disease. There is a major risk of accelerated atherosclerosis, ischaemic heart disease and thromboembolic disease. Individuals are advised to stop smoking. Ability to self - care and get about may be seriously affected by these complications Skin complications Skin rashes, hair loss, and mouth ulcers are a nuisance, but do not in themselves cause lasting disabling effects. The person may have to avoid sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet light. Hair loss may be reversed or may remain permanent because of scarring. This can cause emotional distress. Mouth ulcers and ulcers that occur in other sites (such as the nose) can occur in crops and can be quite distressing. Raynaud's Disease can be secondary to lupus; persistent Raynaud's Disease may lead to problems with self - care, because of the effects on manual dexterity. Basically , SLE is normally a treatable, manageable condition for the majority of people and treatment aims to control disease activity and enable independence. Also, it is important to note that the severity of the disease cannot be judged on the basis of the type or dosage of the drugs used to control the disease. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claiman t. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? General Modern treatment, better clinical awareness and improved serological testing techniques have dramatically improved survival. However, 10% of lupus patients d ie within 5 years of diagnosis. Even moderate disease should be under the care of a Specialist centre. The disease should never be \"taken for granted\", as there is a risk of major organ effects and death. Also, inevitably, there are people who suffer serio us side effects from the treatment, which can complicate symptoms, and in rare cases, lead to death. An example is the use of steroids which can lead to hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, or osteoporosis (18% have the metabolic syndrome). A per son who is on long - term immunosuppressive treatment may succumb to an overwhelming infection. However, the treatment is always aimed at controlling the underlying inflammation and minimising risks from the treatment. The disease is relapsing and remitting , in both mild and severe cases. Prognosis has improved greatly in the last few years; and 5 - year survival is now around 90%. Good control of early inflammatory symptoms leads to a better long - term prognosis. Long - term prognosis also depends on early detection and treatment of complications, such as kidney disease. The main cause of death is accelerated atherosclerosis and kidney disease. The prophylactic prevention and management of cardiovascular risk is very important in improving the person' s prognosis. If any of the following complications are present, the prognosis & duration details for that impairment should be referred to and followed. Specific Musculo -skeletal complications -: Jaccoud's Arthropathy is not likely to improve. A pers on who has avascular necrosis of the hip may have a total hip replacement, in which, case this particular condition is likely to improve. Details for -: Rheumatoid Arthritis Osteoarthritis Skin c omplications -: Scarring of the scalp and hair loss can be permanent. Persistent Raynaud's Disease can be a permanent problem, but it may improve if amenable to treatment, such as Nifedipine. More severe and unresponsive cases may require more specialist intervention. Mental Health and Central Nervous System Complications Symptoms may fluctuate, and the symptoms may range from Mild to severe effects such as mild depression to severe psychosis and Either a mental health effect (ranging from depression to psychosis), or a central nervous effect, such as epilepsy, ataxia, neuropathy or hemiplegia for example. Kidney Complications Clinical kidney involvement occurs in around 30% of cases and affects prognosis. Kidney disease is one of the two main causes of death in lupus. The person may be in renal failure, requiring dialysis or a transplant and prognosis will depend on the treatment and response to that treatment. Details for -: Kidney disorders Hypertension Cardiovascular complications Accelerated atherosclerosis is the other main cause of death in SLE. Good preventative measures must be implemented in order to improve prognosis. Arrythmias (irregular heartbeat) may ari se as a result of a mild myocarditis. Thromboembolic disease is another complication, especially in the antiphospholipid syndrome. Prognosis would relate to the presence of these conditions, the efficacy of treatment and the individuals stopping smoking. Details for -: Ischaemic heart Disease Cardiac Arrythmias Stroke Peripheral Vascular Disease Lung Complications Repeated episodes of pleurisy and pleural effusions can be treated and the prognosis will relate to the response to treatment and the length of time it takes. Restrictive lung disease and lung fibrosis will gradually worsen and the effects are permanent. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Over 65 5% o f SLE develops after the age of 65. It tends to take a milder course and certain symptoms such as joint pain and sicca (dry) symptoms, such as dry eyes, mouth, problems with swallowing etc occur more commonly. Because older people are more likely to be on medication, drug - induced SLE presents more often and takes a relatively mild course.

Medical Services Medical Services are available to interpret information including investigation results, and also to request relevant information from the GP or hospital Consultant. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs A person's care and mobility needs should be assessed in relation to their symptoms and response to treatment. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, a person may have difficulties with the following activities -: Self- care Getting in and out of bed, washing & bathing, including getting in and out of the bath, going to the toilet, dressing and undressing, preparing a meal, walking in the house, and climbing stairs. Mobility Walking on the flat may be impaired by muscle pain and stiffness. However, response to treatment is usually quite rapid; the person feels better in a matter of days rather than weeks. These needs may be present for a short time only and that is a few weeks at the most. A customer with visual problems related to temporal arteritis may satisfy the H/R Mobility criteria under the Severely Visually Impaired (SVI) deeming provisions . In summary, treatment should alleviate the symptoms and the person should have few or no care needs arising from Temporal Arteritis. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Temporal Arte ritis normally improves dramatically with treatment, so care and mobility needs may only be present for a few weeks at the most, though steroid treatment is likely to need to continue for at least 2 years. The only disabling effects would be from vascula r complications, such as complete or partial loss of vision or stroke. Click the link for details of -: Visual Impairment H/R Mob SVI deeming provision Stroke Also, bearing in mind the side -effects of long -term steroid use, there may be associated problems (such as osteoporosis, weight gain, diabetes and high blood pressure) so the maintenance dose should be kept as low as possible. Also osteoporosis prev ention medication should be used, usually calcium and vitamin D and a biphosphonate. Sudden blindness may be permanent and if a stroke (rarely) occurs, there will not be likely to be improvement after 2 years. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section Over 65 Temporal Arteritis tends to occur in the older person, the most problematic factor is the dependence on long -term steroids, and the side -effects caused by this treatment. Side effects are less if the maintenance dose is kept below 7.5mg per day. Azathioprine may be used to reduce the dose of steroid. Medication to prevent Osteoporosis (calcium and Vitamin D and a biphosphonate such as disodium etidronate) should be routinely used, but particularly in the older person.

On the rare occasion when needs are identified because of Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy treatments, they can be expected to resolve when treatment is complete. Disabling effects of treatments Chemotherapy The majority of men will have early stage disease (stage 1) and are likely to require only one cycle of chemotherapy after surgery, recovery will be complete, typically within two to three months. For those with metastatic disease treatment is likely to be more prolonged e.g. 4 cycles of chemotherapy and extra treatments such as further surgery, chemo or radiotherapy. The minimum time for treatment and recovery for these men is six months but treatment related disability may extend over a period of years. If there is time men are offered the opportunity to ban k sperm before chemotherapy starts because of potential chemotherapy -related infertility. Those who have high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant are at high risk of developing infection and experience quite severe side effects during treatment. I n the long term they may never fully recover physical strength and may have any of the enduring effects of chemotherapy especially fatigue. Radiotherapy Treatment for seminoma is given over 10 to 14 days. Specific side effects include diarrhoea and nause a. Further surgery Some men may need further surgery either before or after chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment. This will usually be to remove 'lumps' or 'masses' of secondary cancer identified on Computerised Tomography (CT) scanning. These oper ations and their side effects are: - 'Lymphadenectomy' - Removal of lymph nodes from the back wall of the abdomen. This may be carried out as an open or laparoscopic operation; the recovery time is 2 -6 weeks. Lung surgery is major surgery and requires 3 -12 weeks for recovery. If a significant amount of lung tissue is removed this may result in reduced exercised tolerance - getting out of breath easily and not being able to exercise as hard as before. Long term disabling effects of treatment These are important in testicular cancer because it affects young men, often in their twenties; by the time they are in their forties a significant number may already have developed long term side effects of treatment. Risks include an increased chance of de veloping leukaemia, melanoma, sarcoma, cancers of stomach, bladder, colon, pancreas, lung, prostate, kidney and thyroid. They are at increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. They may experience any of the enduring side effects of chemotherapy. Having cancer at a young age is hard to cope with psychologically. They will be coping with potential loss of life, side effects of treatment, loss of a testicle and hair loss. They may have to stop work or change their type of work as a result of their diagnosis. Their worries may include significant financial problems, fears of the future related to their disease and problems with body image, any of which may cause depression. Back to top of section How long will the needs l ast? Most men will experience some side effects during treatment of testicular cancer. Any needs identified are likely to be related to treatment and recovery is expected when treatment is complete, typically within 2 -3 months. Five year survival for test icular cancer in the UK is 96% - most men have early stage disease and make a full recovery. Those with more advanced disease at diagnosis are also expected to make a full recovery, time taken for treatment and recovery is likely to be longer and at least six months. Some men will have enduring side effects of treatment which persist when it is complete and they are in remission. New long term side effects may develop years later particularly after radiotherapy treatment. Stage 1 disease Five year survival is 95%. The majority of men are expected to make a full recovery. There are no long term disabling effects other than the rare enduring side effects of chemotherapy and infertility in some men. The men who have had radiotherapy treatment may develop late side effects of this treatment some years later. Stage 2 disease Five year survival is 80 -90%, with non -seminoma being at the lower end. The majority of men are expected to make a full recovery. There are no long term disabling effects other than the rare enduring side effects of chemotherapy and infertility in some men. Stage 3 disease Five year survival is 70% for both types of testicular cancer. The majority of men are expected to make a full recovery. Treatment and recovery are likely to take at least six months. There are no long term disabling effects other than the rare enduring side effects of chemotherapy and infertility in some men. Recurrent disease is fairly common and may cause any of the symptoms in the recurrent/metastatic disease group. Stage 4 disease This is advanced testicular cancer at diagnosis; they may have any of the disabling effects of metastatic disease. Five year survival for these men is 48% for men with non -seminoma testicular cancer and 72% for seminoma type cancer. Treatment and recovery are likely to take at least six months. Metastatic and Recurrent disease Those who have recurrent disease, which is not responding to treatment or who have had more than two recurrences are more likely to have indefinite needs and may be te rminally ill.

Children and adults with major forms of Thalassaemia will be attending specialist hospital centres on a long -term basis for regular monitoring and treatment. Reports may be obtained from doctors, specialist nurses and other health care professionals working in these centres. People with less severe types of Thalassaemia attend haematology clinics or are under the care of general practitioners. Medical reports may be obtained confirming that the anaemia is mild and asymptomatic. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Mild functional restrictions People in the following categories are likely to have few or no functional restrictions: - Adults with mild asymptomati c anaemia due to Thalassaemia minor variants, have no functional restrictions. They are able to lead normal lives, care for themselves and walk without problem. People with Thalassaemia intermedia who have mild to moderate anaemia (haemoglobin in range 8 -11 g/dl). The body adapts to this degree of anaemia and the person is not usually fatigued, debilitated or short of breath. They are unlikely to have any functional restrictions and have no ADL or mobility needs. Some adults with successfully treated beta -Thalassaemia major and no substantial complications may have few or minor functional restrictions only. Although they may require regular blood transfusions on a 3 - 4 weekly basis their haemoglobin is maintained within the range 9.5 - 11 g/dl. They are able to function normally for the majority of the time, even in the week prior to transfusion, and are able to care for themselves fully and walk without problem. Someone with an additional problem such as mild asthma will cope less well with th e drop in haemoglobin and is more likely to be in the moderate functional restrictions group. Moderate functional restrictions Moderate to severe anaemia (Hb 8 g/dl or less) in a person with Thalassaemia intermedia may cause functional restriction on a d ay-to-day basis. They may be persistently fatigued and short of breath on exertion, and require some help with dressing, bathing and preparation of food. Walking may be limited due to both fatigue and shortness of breath. The following complications of l ong-term anaemia and iron overload in adults may cause moderate functional restrictions in people classified in the intermediate and major groupings. The ability to self -care and to walk may be affected by these medical conditions, either singly or in comb ination, and will be exacerbated by fatigue and shortness of breath. heart failure and dysrhythmias (dysrhythmia is often a cause of death) limb deformities, arthritic joints, osteoporosis abnormal liver function, liver failure, cirrhosis long term leg ul ceration pulmonary hypertension diabetic complications hepatitis C Please see relevant guidance for further information on these medical conditions. Severe functional restrictions The most severe functional restrictions are likely to be found in individuals who have not been treated adequately in childhood. Such individuals will have failed to grow and develop normally, will be short with longer limbs in proportion to the spine and abnormally shaped heads (typically described as a chipmunk facies) . The latter may lead to deafness. They are likely to have heart disease, of those patients who are in inadequately treated 55% will have died by age 35. Adults with severe iron overload may also have severe functional restrictions due to heart failure, l iver failure and diabetic complications - see relevant guidance. The most severe problem is heart failure which will require 24 hour infusion treatment, often using a portacath. Heart failure is commonly so severe that they are unable to walk up stairs and dysrhythmias further limit exercise tolerance when they occur. Ejection fraction is commonly monitored regularly in these cases, information on this test is available in the heart failure guidance. Neuropathy and ulceration of the lower limbs is common a nd is likely to limit mobility in those patients with Thalassaemia intermedia. People with these problems are likely to need help with all aspects of self - care and are likely to be restricted in their walking. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Thalassaemia major Without regular transfusions children with beta -Thalassaemia major die before the age of five from heart failure or infection. Successful survival into adult hood depends on close monitoring of the affected person in a specialist Thalassaemia centre where all the physical, psychological, genetic and social effects of the condition can be addressed. From a therapeutic stand point successful treatment includes avoidance of iron overload through chelation therapy. Without treatment of iron overload death from heart disease occurs in the early twenties. Life expectancy in adults is reduced due to liver and/or heart disease secondary to iron overload. Bone marrow transplantation is more likely to be successful if undertaken before the age of sixteen, and when the marrow is donated by a close relative, usually a sibling, who has a good genetic match to the recipient. The prognosis is less favourable for the recipie nt with beta -Thalassaemia complications such as liver damage and iron overload. Cord blood transfusion is a relatively new procedure and there is little data at present on long -term outcomes. Thalassaemia intermedia Children and adults with Thalassaemia intermedia have a better prognosis. Individuals with more severe levels of anaemia are likely to have reduced life expectancy and poor overall health due to complications of the condition. Thalassaemia minor/carrier People are asymptomatic, lead normal lives and have a normal life expectancy.

Once treated the size of the gland should gradually regress over a period of several months. No residual disability and no variability in the condi tion would be expected. Myxoedema can produce a significant degree of illness and untreated can lead to coma and possible death. Once recognised it can be treated effectively and recovery occurs quickly, usually within three months. However difficulties w ith establishing control and an effective replacement dose of thyroxine may delay full recovery by up to six months. Hypothyroidism in infants and children can lead to serious failure to thrive, small stature and failure of intellectual development (the sy ndrome of cretinism) which if unrecognised or untreated can result in permanent impairment of intellectual development and leads to severe dependency. Once treated the effects of myxoedema would not be expected to cause significant disability with no conti nuing effect on function of the limbs, the spine, the cardiovascular system or mental state. The effects of thyrotoxicosis depend on the duration of the condition, the age of the patient and response to treatment. It can result in a severe thyrotoxic cris is with fever, delirium or coma, seizures, vomiting, diarrhoea and jaundice, death being caused by arrhythmias, heart failure or hyperthermia. However, the condition is usually recognised well before such dramatic presentation occurs and once the cause has been established it can be treated effectively. Delay in establishing effective dosage of medication or recovery from surgery may impede progress but full recovery to normal existence is expected in all but a few cases. In some cases signs of thyrotoxico sis can occur without increase in activity of the thyroid gland. This occurs in some forms of thyroiditis and in cases where excess doses of thyroid hormone have been taken as treatment of hypothyroidism. Malignant disease of the thyroid gland, rarer forms of thyroid disease or the particular effects of ionising radiation on thyroid function can cause complex long -term illness and require separate consideration. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Goitre If untreated euthyroid goitre usually progresses slowly but adverse effects are limited to the increasing cosmetic defect of the swelling and the possibility of secondary pressure effects. Once treated the size of the gland should gradually regress over a per iod of several months. No residual disability and no variability in the condition would be expected. Myxoedema Onset of symptoms of myxoedema is usually insidious and the condition may not be recognised in early stages. Once the condition has been diagno sed and treated recovery should be complete with no residual disability after a few month's treatment. Relapse can occur as a result of poor compliance with treatment but day -to-day variability in the condition would not be expected. Thyrotoxicosis Thyro toxicosis tends to develop insidiously at first but progresses fairly rapidly to overt symptoms. Treatment should achieve control of the condition in the great majority of cases with many achieving an effective cure. Long -term follow -up to monitor progress may be needed. Symptomatic improvement should occur within three months of treatment and unless there is medical evidence of complications that are not amenable to treatment, no continuing loss of function would be expected. Function of limbs or spine, th e cardiovascular system and mental state would be expected to be normal. Once recognised and treated there should be little or no variability other than from adverse effects of antithyroid drugs or poor compliance with treatment. Such changes should be rec ognisable by the patient and effectively managed by routine medical follow -up. Apart from when caused by malignant disease or where secondary to another coincidental condition, thyrotoxicosis can be treated effectively. Life-long medication may be needed i n some cases but patients should be able to follow a normal life -style with no continuing disability. There would need to be medical evidence of chronic secondary complications or difficulty with control of the condition, to support claims of chronic funct ional disability from this and other thyroid disorders.

People with moderate symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhoea may experience some restriction in normal activities during flare -ups. It is likely however those symptoms will remit after a few weeks with treatment. There is unlikely to be any need for long -term assistance with self -care. Adults who have undergone surgery for ulcerative colitis, whether emergency or elective surgery would be expected to make a go od recovery with a few weeks or months. They should also be able to learn to manage an ileostomy independently within this time scale. People with moderate and severe disease are unlikely to be restricted in ability to walk, since lower limb function is n ot affected by the condition. Urgency of defaecation or the need to find a toilet when out, is not considered to lead to a need for guidance or supervision. Similarly, in the majority of cases, the care needs of those with a severe functional restriction will be insufficient to satisfy entitlement conditions. How long will the needs last? In many cases good control of the symptoms and exacerbations can be achieved with appropriate medication. At any one time 50% of people are asymptomatic, 30% have mild symptoms and 20% have moderate to severe disease. People learn to control the symptoms themselves by use of medication and attention to nutrition. Many people have long periods of complete remission. Overall life expectancy is the same as tha t of the general population. In comparison with older people younger people tend to have more extensive disease. Older people however may have more adverse outcomes, if they have a severe attack with complications. After thirty years a third of people wi th ulcerative colitis affecting the whole colon develop colonic cancer. Surgical removal of the entire colon is associated with a good prognosis removing the need for long -term medication to prevent remission, and eliminates the risk of developing colonic cancer. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to t op of section Over 65 Elderly people with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, and some debilitated older people recovering from surgery, may be functionally restricted. They may need help to move around house, get upstairs, get on and off the toilet a nd help with personal hygiene, dressing and bathing. They may also need help with using pads and waterproof pants to control faecal incontinence if diarrhoea is persistent, or limited mobility slows down access to the toilet. Elderly people may take longe r, up to several months, to learn to manage an ileostomy. Problems with manual dexterity, visual impairment or dementia might lead a long -term need for help with ileostomy care. Frail elderly ,especially if underweight or subject to poor nutrition, may hav e a much longer requirement for self -care, assistance with medication, encouragement to maintain adequate nutrition and fluid intake, and may also be prone to falls.

However urticaria does not usually impair function of the limbs or the individual ability to care for personal needs. Pressure urticaria affecting the soles of the feet may cause discomfort on standing and walking but the effect is generally short -lived. Chronic urticaria can be disabling particularly where there is an associated systemic reaction with jo int pain and fever but such circumstances should not persist for more than a few weeks other than in rare cases. Patients who have persistent disabling chronic urticaria would be expected to be under the care of a specialist and medical evidence of the se verity of the condition should be available to confirm the ongoing disability. How long will the needs last? Urticaria does not usually cause significant functional restrictions. Once it has developed, allergic sensitisation tends to persist for life and the urticarial reaction can recur with any exposure to the relevant allergen. In many cases, a degree of tolerance can develop and the condition may resolve spontaneously. Where sensitivity is due to a known agent that can be avoided, such as a particular drug, the condition may never recur. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

Hospital Factual Report In all cases of moderate and severe cardiac disease a Consultant Cardiologist and a Specialist Cardiac Nurse would normally have been involved in the diagnosis, management and treatment of the individual. Indeed the absence of any documented history of a Cardiology consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if required. If a person has undergone a successful valve replacement operation, the claimant will be followed up in the hospital Outpatient Department, and this will be the best source of information for his/ her residual needs. The Cardiac Rehabilitation Nurse The Cardiac Rehabilitation Nurse is a Specialist nurse , who works in close contact with the Cardiologist, and is part of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Team. She/he is closely involved with the patient, from the start of the hospital stay, and, as well as attending to the physical needs of the patient, is crucial in advising and supporting the patient. Heart failure patients suffer from an enormous impact on their confidence in their ability to do things and a large proportion of them suff er from depression and the Specialist Nurse is there to support them. She/he also can act as an intermediary between the Consultant (and the rest of the team) and the patient, giving advice on medication, dose adjustments, lifestyle, social issues and so o n. He/she is also in a position to tell the patient about their illness and discuss things like prognosis, which may be worrying the patient, as well as being an important issue. This contact is kept up after the patient is discharged, for both medical an d psychological reasons; and phone contact, for reassurance of the patient, may take place several times a week, in cases of severe heart failure. At late - stage or end - stage disease, the patient may contact the nurse many times because of the need for psychological, financial or social support and for advice on managing often quite complex treatment regimes. Obviously, the amount of contact varies with the severity of the condition and the readiness of the patient to seek help. The Specialist Nurse can also act as a go - between for the patient, GP and Consultant co -ordinating and adjusting the treatment options. Therefore, this role is recognized as being extremely important for the well - being of the patients and more and more hospitals use their s ervices on a permanent basis. General Practitioner Factual report The General Practitioner would normally have made the initial referral of the claimant to the Cardiologist and would normally be aware of the results of tests, and current medication. The general practitioner may not have such detailed knowledge of the claimant's needs, if he/ she is more frequently managed by the Consultant Cardiologist, and the Specialist Cardiac Nurse, (who are more likely to have detai led knowledge of exercise tolerance, and the disabling effects of the condition). If there is no specialist health professional involvement or evidence cannot be obtained from them, then a factual report from the claimant's own doctor would be more approp riate. HCP examination Report An HCP examination report would be likely to be necessary when t he person claims significant disability (equivalent to a moderate or severe condition), but there is no supporting evidence from the GP or hospital Specialist; if no corroborative evidence has been able to be obtained; or if it is the only means whereby the claimant's needs can be clarified. Medical Services The Medical Services doctor may be asked to request relevant information such as test results from the GP or Hospital Consultant, and to interpret test results and other information. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Life and Mobility needs Disabling Eff ects The main disabling effects of valvular heart disease are due to the consequences of the diseased valve and include heart failure and stroke. If evidence suggests that the customer has heart failure or has had a stroke, which may have resulted from val vular heart disease then go to Heart Failure guidance or Strokes guidance . In the case of aortic stenosis, angina may occur because of a sudden drop in blood pressure resulting in an inadequate supply of oxygen to the heart muscle even where the coronary arteries are healthy. How long will the needs last? Any mobility and care needs are likely to be the result of secondary effects of the valvular heart disease such as stroke or heart failure.

Back to top of section Valvular Heart disease in people over 65 Both the incidence (number of new ca ses reported in a population over a certain period of time) and prevalence (percentage of the population affected with a particular condition at a given time) of valvular heart disease increases with increasing age. As with other conditions in older peopl e, the existence of other pathology can confuse the issue, (as far as diagnosis is concerned) and the older person may present with heart failure, palpitations, dizziness, falls, breathlessness, angina, fainting or collapse. Valvular heart disease is a di sease of ageing and most people over the age of 70 show symptomatic evidence of valve dysfunction and around 10% show evidence of significant disease; the process is likely to have begun earlier than that (from the age of 60). Senile degeneration can be a cause of both valve stenosis and valve regurgitation (incompetence). However, in older people who suffered from rheumatic fever (without the benefit of antibiotics), mitral valve regurgitation, valve and tricuspid valve stenosis may result (with often more than one valve being affected). Tricuspid valve regurgitation is often associated with a severe, longstanding lung disorder and is therefore more likely to occur in older people. Aortic Valve Stenosis In the Western world, aortic valve stenosis is mainly a disease of older people as the pathological process involves scarring and calcification in the cusps of the valve. It normally presents in a person's 70's or 80's. Aortic valve s tenosis is a common cause of fainting, angina and heart failure in older people and there is a real risk of sudden death on exertion. Coronary Artery disease and Valvular Heart disease 20% of people with aortic regurgitation have coronary artery disease. A common cause of mitral regurgitation is a myocardial infarction, where the papillary (supporting) muscles of the mitral valve are damaged. Surgery in Valvular Heart disease Surgery can take place even in the very elderly with a great deal of benefit but because of the likelihood of reduced health, strength and resilience and the possible presence of other disease conditions, the mortality risk may be higher. If valve replacement surgery is undertaken, a biological valve may be preferable to use in an ol der person for two reasons: - It is likely to last the patient's lifespan, There is no need for the use of anticoagulants (the use of which requires careful monitoring and which have potentially serious side effects). The person may be too frail to be a candidate for surgical valve replacement and drug therapy may alleviate symptoms to some extent.

Read more about award duration Over 65's DVT is common in the elderly because many of the precipitating factors are common (immobility, fractures, etc.). Anti-coagulant therapy involves a greater risk of bleeding in older patients. Chronic Venous Insufficiency What is it? Chronic venous insufficiency is a condition in which the blood, which normally would flow back to the heart from t he veins in the legs, does not do so efficiently, because the valves in the veins are damaged or absent. As a result, blood pools in the legs, and causes complications without treatment. Conditions which may result are pain and swelling of the legs, skin infections or skin ulcers. Causes Congenital absence , weakness or damage to the valves of the leg veins, (both of the superficial veins and the perforating veins) The condition may also be caused by a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This may be referred to as syndrome\" or \"post -phlebitic syndrome\". Increased venous pressure in the legs Rarely, varicose veins. Risk factors Increased age Other family members with the condition Lifestyle - that includes obesity, sedentary lifestyle or jobs (involving sitting or standing for long periods of time), smoking, wearing tight or restrictive clothing which impair the venous circulation. Symptoms Pain in the legs, worse on standing and improved by elevating the legs Swelling of t he legs Dull, aching, itching, cramping feeling, due to venous hypertension Signs can include: Swelling (oedema) of the leg/s Varicose veins Non-healing ulcers on the leg/s, especially on the insides of the ankles (this is where the pressure in the veins is greatest) Characteristic skin changes which include scaly skin, hard and pigmented skin on the legs. The pigment is a reddish brown due to a leakage of red blood cells into the skin. \"Champagne Bottle Leg\" which describes the calf of the leg becoming permanently enlarged, with a narrow ankle. This is as a result of the leakage of plasma into the subcutaneous (fatty) tissue, which causes fibrosis of this tissue layer. This is known as lipodermatosclerosis. Back to top of sec tion Superficial Thrombophlebitis The term \"superficial thrombophlebitis\" means a clot, with inflammation, occurring in a vein under the skin. It often occurs in varicose veins, but can also occur as a result of injury to the vein, such as from an intra venous injection, indwelling intravenous cannula, or from intravenous drug abuse (use of street drugs). There is a sudden, localized inflammatory reaction in the vein wall with a secondary thrombus (clot) which is strongly adherent to the vessel wall. The clinical picture is of pain, redness and swelling along the vein, which can be seen and felt as a hard, cord -like structure. Normally it is not possible for superficial thrombophlebitis to cause an embolus, but unlike in superficial veins in other part s of the body (such as in the legs and arms) superficial thrombophlebitis in groin veins may spread into a deep vein, where the clot may break off and cause an embolus. Treatment is with aspirin, elevating the affected limb and the use of topical non- steroidal anti -inflammatory cream, and hirudoid cream. Sometimes, thrombophlebitis repeatedly occurs in normal veins. When this occurs it is known as Thrombophlebitis Migrans and it may be associated with cancer of an organ such as carcinoma of the body or tail of the pancreas, and ovarian carcinoma. A person who presents with this symptom should be carefully evaluated, as there may be an underlying serious condition. Disabling Effects The inflammatory effects of superficial thrombophlebitis are no rmally short - lived, and respond well to treatment, and there should be no lasting disabling effects, though the vein is likely to feel hard for a considerable time. If Thrombophlebitis Migrans is present, the care and mobility needs will depend on the p atient's general condition and the extent of the underlying severe illness, such as cancer of the pancreas.

Hospital Factual Report In cases of moderate and severe peripheral vascular disease, a Consultant Vascular Surgeon would normally have been involved in the diagnosis, management and treatment of the individual. Indeed the absence of any documented history of a specialist consultation should raise doubts about the nature and/or severity of the given diagnosis. Hospital factual reports should therefore be obtained if req uired. General Practitioner Factual report The General Practitioner would normally have made the initial referral of the claimant to the Consultant, and would normally be aware of the results of tests, and current medication.

Back to top of section Activities for Daily Living and Mobility needs Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) There may well be quite intense pain and swelling in the acute phase, and mobility will be affected, but this phase should last no longer than a few weeks at the most. Any intercurrent condition, such as fractures or major illness should be taken into consideration as well. How long will the needs last? Deep Venous Thrombosis (uncomplicated) There may well be quite intense pain and swelling in the acute phase, and mobility will be affected, but this phase should last no longer than a few weeks at the most. Pulmonary Embolus A massive pulmonary embolus is normally fa tal. Multiple small infarcts may cause lung damage. There would normally be reduction in the person's ability to exert him / herself affecting both ability to self - care and to get about. If the person is sufficiently breathless to have care/ mobility n eeds the prognosis is as follows -: Acute condition - should last no longer than a few weeks. Chronic condition (that is, present for more than 9 months) - If an award is made then award for an Indefinite period. Post - Thrombotic Syndrome and Venous Ulc ers Incompetence of superficial and perforator veins only (excellent long - term results where up to 90% of venous ulcers heal completely after surgical treatment) -: With surgical treatment - no care/mobility needs after recovery from operation which woul d normally be about 6 weeks. Without surgical treatment - If an award is made then award for an Indefinite period. Most symptoms can be controlled by the wearing of elastic stockings. However, if the deep veins are incompetent, there could be a high rate of recurring problems. In this case, any care/ mobility needs are likely to be indefinite. Varicose Veins The condition responds very well to elastic support stockings and surgery, and there should be no disabling effects after successful use of support stockings and after successful surgery. Superficial Thrombophlebitis The inflammatory effects of superficial thrombophlebitis are normally short - lived, and respond well to treatment, and there should be no lasting disabling effects, though the vein is likely to feel hard for a considerable time.

However the clinical features and treatment of the liver impairments are similar in both age groups. What evidence i s available? Hepatitis A Hepatitis A resolves in the majority of cases without any specific treatment. Hepatitis B General Practitioner factual reports provide information on diagnosis and management in those who have recovered from an acute attack of hepatitis B. They may also be useful in confirming chronic carriage of hepatitis B, or for people with chronic infection whose condition is stable, and who have few symptoms. People who have had a severe episode of infec tion, those who have chronic hepatitis B and those being treated with drugs like interferon will be under hospital care. Similarly individuals with complications such as cirrhosis, and those being assessed for or awaiting liver transplantation, will be und er the care of specialist liver centres. Reports should be obtained from hospital doctors or specialist nurses working in these clinics. Hepatitis C Initial diagnosis will follow blood testing and m ost people will be referred to hospital for assessment of disease severity. People who are chronic carriers or those who have mild disease and few symptoms may be followed up by General Practitioners. General practitioner reports will confirm the diagnosis and provide information on any functional limitations. People with progressive disease (chronic hepatitis), those having drug therapy and with late manifestations such as cirrhosis are followed up in hospital clinics including specialist liver units. Hos pital doctors and specialist nurses should be approached for reports. Medical Services can advise on the severity of the condition if this is not clear from information provided in medical reports. Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Hepatitis A Because of the short lived nature of the condition and its spontaneous resolution, there are unlikely to be any functional restrictions leading to care/mobility needs. Hepatitis B Someone recovering from acute hepatitis B infection may experience fatigue and lethargy for a few months. Recovery is usually complete, and symptoms would not be so severe, that it is likely that help would be necessary with personal care or wa lking would be restricted to any degree. Chronic hepatitis B carriers are generally asymptomatic and do not have functional restrictions on a day -to-day basis. People with established chronic hepatitis B may experience some non - specific symptoms of malai se and fatigue. These are unlikely to limit activities in the early years but may become more prominent with time. Late complications including cirrhosis , ascites , portal hypertension and hepatic encephalopathy are likely to lead to decreased mobility and a need for help with self -care and supervision. Drug treatment for chronic hepatitis may be associated with increased levels of fatigue and general debility, which may have additive effects in respect of existing functional limitations. Medical Services a dvice may be helpful in determining if extra help with care is necessary during the duration of treatment. Hepatitis C Acute hepatitis C resolves spontaneously over some weeks or a few months. There are no functional limitations that are likely to be severe or persistent. People with positive blood tests for hepatitis C (chronic carriers) will be asymptomatic for many years and have no functional problems. Even those known to have progressive disease (chronic hepatitis C) may have few symptoms with mi nimal disabling effects for up to 20 years or more. With the development of cirrhosis and progressive impairment of liver function functional restrictions may be attributable to severe fatigue, weight loss, muscle weakness, jaundice, anorexia, ascites etc. Help may be needed with personal care, moving around, rising from a chair, preparing food etc. and walking may be restricted. The side effects of the drug treatment for hepatitis C can be debilitating. They may increase the degree of functional restrictions experienced by someone who already has clinical features of liver damage. People with hepatitis C of moderate severity however may have few symptoms or functional restrictions when drug treatment commences. In these cases any resultant care ne eds or difficulties in walking attributable to drug side effects such as fatigue, flu like symptoms etc. should be carefully evaluated. In many cases they will not be sufficiently severe to affect personal care or to restrict mobility, and will only persi st for the limited duration of the treatment. If evidence shows that the customer has cirrhosis, which may have resulted from Chronic Hepatitis C then go to Cirrhosis guidance. If evidence shows that the customer has liver fa ilure, which may have resulted from Chronic Hepatitis C then go to the Liver Failure guidance. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Hepatitis A Hepatitis A resolves in the majority of cases without any specific treatment. Most cases recover within 10 days; in some people recovery may be delayed for up to 3 months. Fatal liver failure can occur in 0.3% of cases, often in very elderly people. Hepatitis B Most people who have an acute episode of hepatitis B infection make a complete recovery within 6 to 12 months. Chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus often remain well without symptoms for many years. They are however a potential source of infection to others via infected blood and other body fluids. A small percentage of people with persistent virus infection develop chronic hepatitis. Progressive deterioration in their health and liver function occurs over a number of years. Ultimately they may develop liver failure, cirrhosis and hepato -cellular carcinoma, all of which potentially have an adverse prognosis. Hepatitis C Following a symptomatic acute infection there is spontaneous recovery within a few weeks or months. For individuals with chronic infection the following factors are associated with a worse outlook and more rapid progression to severe liver disease: - Male gender, Alcohol consumption, Age over 40 years at time of infection, Additional infection with HIV and/or hepatitis B, Treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. However many people with chronic infection live out a normal life span. If evidence shows that the customer has liver failure, which may have resulted from Chronic Hepatitis C then go to the Liver Fai lure guidance. If evidence shows that the customer has cirrhosis, which may have resulted from Chronic Hepatitis C then go to Cirrhosis guidance.

Please note: If the Consultant Ophthalmologist doesn't have up to date information, consider arranging for an eyecare examination. Other evidence sources The claimant and / or carer may be able to provide information about near and distant visual acuity or perhaps provide a certificate confirming registration of partial sightedness or blindness (if appropriate). However, if details of central or peripheral visual defect are needed, the Consultant or General Practitioner is an appropriate source of information. ROVIC ( Rehabilitation Officers Visually Impaired Children) will be able to provide information about Symptoms, signs, investigations including assessment of vision, treatment/management, and likely to have information about resulting disability or needs. The Orthoptist will be able to provide information about assessment of vision (visual acuity and fields). The Optometrist will be able to provide information about symptoms, signs, investigations including assessment of vision, treatment/management, and likely to have information about resulting disability, needs and provision of low vision aids. Certificate of Visual Impairment (CVI) The CVI provides details of near and distant visual acuity. However, it can also provide details of visual field loss and additional information that may be useful to the DM. A copy of the CVI is sent to the customer and GP therefore it is worthwhile asking the customer / carer for a copy if one is available. Low Vision Assessment Report For some visually impaired claimants (usually those with a recent sight loss) a low vision assessment report could be helpful. Services across the country may differ, and can also be called different things in different places, however, they come under the umbrella of Social Services. There are national standards for Social Services departments called 'Progress in Sight' but they are not mandatory. In some places the low v ision service could be in -house with Social Services, in others it may be contracted to a local voluntary group. However for those people who have had a low vision assessment, the report could be of great use in describing the practical difficulties arisi ng from their vision loss. In certain circumstances (e.g. deaf / blind cases), it may be appropriate for the Decision Maker to request an Audiological report (a technical assessment) to establish the extent of deafness in a customer. RNIB Website Visionary - Linking Local Light Sight Loss Charities Back to top of section Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs NB. For mild, moderate and severe impairment and for H/R Mobility SVI, this refers to vision corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Mild Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects A person with mild visual impairment (acuity or visual field loss) would normally have a visual acuity of better than 6/18 (20/60) distant vision and up to and including N24 (near). He/ she has a reasonable field of vision. Mobility The person has no physical difficulty in walking, and normally has sufficient vision to read signs, cross roads, and negotiate kerbs and steps safely, though he/ she may have to be more vigilant. ADL He/she would normally be capable of all self -care tasks, such as bathing, dressing, and attending to toilet and hygiene needs. He/ she may require extra light or glasses to cut out glare or for reading (large print books) and for fine tasks such as preparing a meal, combing hair, etc but, in general, adaptations would not be needed. He/she would normally be able to read large print, write, use a computer and watch TV. Moderate Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects A person with moderate visual impairment would normally have a visual acuity (for distant vision) of 6/18 (20/60) or worse, but better than 6/36 (10/60). He/ she is not able in general, to see well in the distance, that is, he/ she may have difficulty in recognising a friend across a road. (\"Recognisi ng a friend\" implies the ability to recognise a friend's facial features, and not from the clothes they are wearing). His/ her near visual acuity would normally be worse than N24, up to N36, and he/ she would be likely to have difficulty in seeing fine det ail close up, and may have difficulty reading even quite large print. He/ she may have quite a reduced field of vision. Mobility The person has no physical difficulty in walking. A person with this level of visual impairment would normally have sufficie nt vision to get about in unfamiliar surroundings, although he/ she would normally have problems negotiating irregular ground, or obstacles, without assistance. However, there are a proportion of people whose visual impairment is such that they would not normally be able to read signs, or see a car coming, and so would not be able to get around in unfamiliar surroundings, safely, on their own. ADL A person with moderate visual impairment should be able, in general, to look after his/ her own personal hygiene, such as washing, bathing, showering, cleaning teeth, dressing, and attending to toilet needs, but there are some people whose vision is impaired to the extent that they may be unable to complete this activity without assistance. Also, fo r the most part, he/ she should be able to prepare and cook a main meal but there may be some people whose visual impairment is such that they may not be able to peel and chop vegetables, and handle hot pans safely. They may have considerable difficulty r eading recipes, and checking cooker dials, but in some cases these difficulties may be overcome by using visual aids. They would be normally unable to read labels on medicine bottles, and check medication levels on syringes, and would normally need assist ance to take tablets, and administer injections (in the case of diabetics). They are likely to have problems with small fastenings, and, with some people, their ability to see fine detail is affected to the extent that they may need assistance in checking that clothes are clean, match and are appropriate. A person with moderate visual impairment would only be able to work or study in an environment which is adapted to visual impairments. Extra vigilance and indeed assistance may be needed on stairs. They ma y be registered Partially Sighted. Severe Functional Restriction Category Description Disabling Effects This is when the visual acuity is greatly reduced even with correction, or there is considerable reduction in visual fields. A person with severe visual impairment would normally have 6/36 (10/60) visual acuity for distant vision, worse than N36 for near vision, or considerably reduced visual fields. He/ she may only be able to see shapes or hand movements, or friends at close quarters. He/ s he may not be able to tell light from dark, or the shape of furniture in a room. Mobility The person would have no physical difficulty walking. He/she would normally have difficulty in reading signs, crossing roads safely, and negotiating kerbs, and t herefore would not normally be able to find his way around in unfamiliar surroundings without assistance. They may also satisfy the H/R Mobility criteria under the Deaf/blind or the Severely Visually Impaired (SVI) deeming provisions (See below). ADL The person would normally have difficulty in checking that clothes are appropriate, and that they are clean, and match, and would normally need assistance in this activity, but should be able to dress and attend to toilet needs him/ herself. He/ she would normally need assistance in having a bath or shower, as he/ she would not normally be able to do this safely on his own. The person would normally need help with administering medicines, checking needles (in the case of diabetics) r eading instructions, and would not normally be able to peel or chop vegetables safely, handle pans of boiling water safely or turn cooker knobs to the correct temperature. Assistance would normally be required for cutting up food. The person would be una ble to read, but may use Braille. Writing would not normally be possible. In the home, he/ she would be likely to need a clear space for getting around, without obstacles, and some people may need assistance. The person would normally not be able to use st airs safely on his/ her own. H/R Mobility Deaf/blind criteria A claimant can satisfy the conditions for the higher rate mobility component if: - they are both deaf and blind and as a result of the combined effects they are unable to walk to their destination out of doors without the assistance of another person. Legislation advises that the claimant must be 100% disabled due to blindness and 80% disabled due to deafness to be considered under the Deeming Provisions. H/R Mobility Severely Visually Impaired (SVI) criteria This applies to people aged between 3 and under 65 on 11 April 2011 who have been certified as severely visually impaired by a consultant Ophthalmologist AND their visual acuity is -: Less than (<) 3/60 ;or 3/60 or more but less than (<) 6/60 with a complete loss of peripheral visual field and a central visual field of no more than 10 degrees in total?

Some of the more unusual conditions not covered may have care / mobility needs depending on the degree of visual loss . Medical Services advice should be obtained in these cases. Other diseases affecting vision / type not known Details of the progression, treatment and prognosis and duration will need to be discussed with Medical Services depending upon the diagnosis. The table above gives suggested award duration depending upon the nature of visual impairment present and will be correct in the majority of cases. There will be rare cases where there is blindness of sudden onset in a person of working age resulting in a particular level of entitlement for a certain period, which may reduce following a period of re -adjustment. However, in general -: A need for guidance or supervision is likely to be permanent unless there is an improvement in vision. Sudden onset blindness (Infrequent) is likely to result in extensive day care/supervision but with time, the person will adapt and be likely to safely find their way around their own home. Unless there is improvement in vision, the person will unlikely to ever be capable of safely preparing a cooked main meal, selecting clothing and checking their appearance. Careful consideration should be given to the person's ability to safely move around indoors and use a bottle or commode. Interaction between blindnes s and other disabling conditions needs to be carefully considered. Entitlement to H/R Mobility under the Deaf/blind provisions is appropriate The Hearing Loss guidance must also be consulted to decide award duration Entitlement to H/R Mobility under th e SVI provisions is appropriate Indefinite award If information/evidence suggests that an indefinite award is not appropriate, discuss with Medical Services. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claiman t. Back to top of section Visual Impairments in people over 65 Visual problems are more common and eye disease likely to be more advanced in the elderly, with 83% of those registered blind over the age of 65. The common caus es of registration are macular degeneration (49%), glaucoma (15%), diabetes (6%), and With ageing, the lens stiffens, causing presbyopia (difficulty in focussing on near objects), with the result that the person needs glasses for reading. In addition cataracts (opacities of the lens) develop (75% of the over - 65's). The retina becomes less sensitive to light making it more difficult to see in low light, and the pupils react more slowly, making it difficult to react to changes in light levels. This makes night driving difficult for affected persons, also finding their way around safely in the home, (for instance, with using stairs). Older people are more likely to have co -existing age -related hearing loss (presbyacusis), and th e combination of the two can have a very disabling effect. Back to top of section Deeming Provisions Combination of blindness and hearing loss (Deaf -blind) Deaf - blindness is defined by Sense (the National Deaf - blind and Rubella Association) as -: \"A severe degree of combined visual and auditory impairment resulting in special needs in the areas of communication, access to information and mobility.\" 100% blind This is defined as being so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential, the same criterion for being registered blind (see Registration of blindness/Partially sighted section). This equates to visual acuity of 3/60 or less or inability to count fingers beyond 50cms. Considerat ion of the visual fields as well as acuity is needed if these are very restricted . 80% Deaf The level of hearing loss must be 87dB or greater when aids are used and it is usual to assess the degree of hearing loss by audiometry. However, since audiograms are almost invariably performed without aids, it has been accepted that at this level of hearing loss, the use of a hearing aid is unlikely to provide significant improvement. Medical Services advice should be sought in these cases. Deaf - Blind Deeming Provision Under the Deeming Provisions for DLA, a claimant can satisfy the conditions for the higher rate mobility component if: - they are both deaf and blind and as a result of the combined effects they are unable to walk to their destination ou t of doors without the assistance of another person. Legislation advises that the claimant must be 100% disabled due to blindness and 80% disabled due to deafness to be considered under the Deeming Provisions. Higher Rate Mobility component Severely Visu ally Impaired (SVI) Deeming Provision Under the Deeming Provisions for DLA, a claimant can satisfy the conditions for the higher rate mobility component if: - They have been certified as severely visually impaired by a consultant Ophthalmologist AND their visual acuity is -: Less than (<) 3/60 ; or 3/60 or more but less than (<) 6/60 with a complete loss of peripheral visual field and a central visual field of no more than 10 degrees in total? If this is the case, the Severely Visually Impaired (SVI) deem ing provision is satisfied. For details of the registration of blindness click on the link below: - Back to top of section Registration of Blindness / Partially Sighted These notes have been taken from the Department of Health's CVI form Explanatory Notes. Certified Blind (Severely sight - impaired) A person can be certified blind (or severely sight impaired) if they are \"so blind as to be unable to perform any work, for which eyesight is essential \". (This equates to 100% disablement for the deaf / blind deeming provisions.) The eyesight, only, is taken into account, and that is measured by visual acuity, and also visual fields are taken into consideration. Those who should be certified blind ar e: Those who have a visual acuity below 3/60 or 1/18 (tested with Snellen's Test type). Those who have acuity better than 3/60, but below 6/60 with a very restricted visual field. Certified Partially Sighted (sight - impaired) Guidelines for this suggest that a person can be certified as partially sighted if \"they are substantially and permanently disabled by defective vision caused by congenital defect or illness or injury\". Those who should be certified partially sighted are: Those who have a visual acuity of from 3/60 to 6/60 (Snellen's) with a full field. Those whose acuity is up to 6/24 (Snellen) with moderate contraction of the field, or aphakia (lens removal) or opacities blocking vision in the eye itself. Those whose acuity is 6/18 or bet ter, if they have a gross defect of visual fields (of both eyes, such as hemianopia) or marked contraction of the visual field (i.e. in retinitis pigmentosa, or glaucoma). The old BD8 form used for certification, has been replaced by the \"Certificate of V ision Impairment\", and when this is signed by a Consultant Ophthalmologist, this becomes formal notification needed for registration. There are also two letters, which can be issued to Social Services with regards to a patient, who is not currently regist ered but who has a \"serious loss of vision\". These are: The Hospital Eye Service Referral of Vision Impaired patient for Social Needs Assessment (RV1 form). Letter concerning vision impairment needs (LV1 form) - (Optometrist Identification of a person wi th significant sight problems). This information can be looked up in more detail, at http://www.dh.gov.uk/sensoryimpairment - \"identification and notification of sight loss\". Users who can access the NHS web, should use the link: How do I register as disabled? Back to top of section Visual acuity The Assessment of Vision Vision is assessed, by formally testing the acuity of both distant and near vision, visual fields, (that is, how far you can see all around at the side, while looking straight ahead) checking the health of the eye and looking at the retina. Binocular visi on is vision using both eyes and monocular vision is vision using one eye. Distant and near vision are tested by using the Snellen's Test Types. Each eye is tested individually. The Ophthalmologist or Optometrist will always do a test of binocular vision d uring the test for visual acuity. However, if this result is not available, the better of the two monocular visual acuities should be used. Most reports will provide monocular acuities i.e. vision in each eye independently and so the VA of the one eye sho uld be used. It may be helpful to give some examples: Left eye Right 6/12 The rule is therefore if this information is available when monocular vision is recorded, take the better of the two eyes to give what is in effect binocular vision. If information is not available then we need to obtain VAO and an optometrist report is likely to be the best source. For distant vision: The person sits or stands at 6 metres, and reads down the v ision chart from the largest letter at the top, to the smallest letter at the bottom. The chart is a large card or a lighted box, which displays the letters. If a person can only see the top letter, their vision is described as 6/60; that means that, whil e at a distance of 6 metres they can only see what a person could normally see at a distance of 60 metres. However, if they can see the letters on the second bottom line, their vision will be described as 6/6 (they can see with equal clarity at 6 metres w hat another person with unimpaired vision standing at 6 metres will see), or the smallest letters on the bottom line, their vision will be described as 6/5, which means that they can clearly see at 6 metres, what a person with unimpaired vision, standing a t 5 metres can see. 6/5 vision would be better than average. The vision test card, and light box, should be well illuminated. The visual acuity is tested firstly without, and then with the use of corrective spectacles, or contact lenses. If the person cannot see the numbers on the chart, the person is moved to 3 or 4 metres from the chart, and tested. If this is not possible, counting fingers, and hand movements (at 30cm), or light perception are recorded. In these cases the reports and the Cert ificate of Visual Impairment may describe the visual acuity in the following manner: NPL - no perception of light PLO - perception of light only HM - hand movements CF - count fingers Back to top of section Snellen Visual A cuity Chart Snellen's chart with equivalent LogMar measurements LogMar is a scale that expresses visual acuity as a decimal. It is usually used for statistical purposes and is rarely used in clinical practice. Snellen 6 metres Snellen 3 metres 0.0 For Near vision: Near vision is tested by using a test card and each eye is tested individually. The card has number of printed paragraphs with print of varying sizes. Each paragraph is described in terms of \"points\" measuring the body of the print - where a \"point\" is 1/72 of an inch. In a common test, N48 is the largest type, and N5 is the smallest, which an unimpaired eye can see, held at a comfortable reading distance, (usually 14 inches), from the eyes . This type is N12.

Linked pages: - Ageing Falls Frailty What is Work Related Upper Limb Disorder Work related upper limb disorder (WRULD) is a general term that covers a number of musculoskeletal conditions which a ffect the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist or hand. It is not a specific disease, but a group of conditions. Previously the terms repetitive strain or stress injury (RSI) were frequently used. There are also specific conditions affecting the upper limbs which may be work -related if it can be shown they are due to occupational overuse. These conditions usually occur in adults of working age. Some conditions are well defined with accepted diagnostic criteria, recognised risk factors and well established medical management. Other conditions, in which there is non -specific forearm or upper limb pain, are less well defined. Classification Specific Upper Limb Disorders These include: Tenosynovitis (including De Quervain's Syndrome) Trigger finger or thumb Rotator cuff syndrome Thoracic outlet syndrome Vibration induced white finger Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Carpal tunnel syndrome (see Carpal tunnel syndrome guidance) Cramp of the hand (Writer's Cramp) (see Dystonia guidance) Epicondylitis Tennis/Golfer's Elbow guidance) Tendonitis (see Tennis/Golfer's Elbow guidance) Non-Specific Work Related Upper Limb Disorders (WRULD) A significant number of individuals with upper limb pain and dysfunction do not show signs which are easily recognised or fit with a definitive diagnosis. Such individuals may have pain which is not localised to one area and the pain may move from one area to another and be of a very indeterminate nature. Examination may often identify very little in the way of objective abnormality. The diagnosis is made when other specific conditions have been ruled out. Non -specific forearm pain has b een defined for research purposes as 'pain in the forearm in the absence of a specific diagnosis or pathology' (Harrington et al . 1998). It is one of the commonest work related upper limb complaints but estimates of its prevalence vary widely. Other featur es which may be present include loss of function, weakness, cramp, muscle tenderness, burning and non - specific paraesthesia, and often a feeling of swelling. Back to top of section What evidence is available? Several medical profe ssionals may be involved in the treatment of an individual with WRULD. These may include: Physiotherapist Occupational Therapist Occupational Physician Rheumatologist Psychologist General Practitioner Should further evidence be required there needs to be verification with the customer about which healthcare professional is seen on a regular basis. Activities of Daily Living and Mobility needs Work related upper limb disorder (WRULD) can be a painful and distressing problem and at its very worst it may cause a sufferer to have to give up or change a job and stop a particular activity completely. Most commonly however, it is manage d with conservative measures and individuals may achieve a return to the workplace. The return to work should initially be on a part -time basis with a subsequent incremental increase in hours and activities. Severe cases of WRULD may result in significant functional problems in self care activities (such as dressing and main meal preparation) but this is only in a very small percentage of cases. There are usually no significant restrictions in the ability to be mobile as a consequence of WRULD. Back to top of section How long will the needs last? Work related upper limb disorder (WRULD) can be a painful and distressing problem but in most cases it will not cause significant functional restrictions. At its very worse it may cause a sufferer to have to give up or change a job or stop a particular activity. Most commonly however, it is managed with conservative measures and considerable improvement in function would be reasonably expected in 12 months. Although it is a troubleso me condition, it usually does not cause significant functional problems. Impairment Award Period WRULD I year award (if entitlement appropriate) All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Back to top of section The effects of ageing Introduction Normal ageing Ageing & disease Clinical features of normal ageing Effects of multiple conditions Side effects of treatment Case example Introduction Ageing is a gradual and continuous process. Ageing can be defined in various ways, including: - \"a distinct and progressi ve decline in function which makes us more vulnerable to disease\", \"a loss of adaptability and failure to maintain the body's homeostasis (metabolic equilibrium)\", \"a process leading to the functional impairment of tissues and organs\", \"A series of changes that lead to the loss of function of organs and cells, with the eventual outcome of death\". It is basically the changes that occur with time, to make a person different from how they were when younger. Obvious, visible signs of ageing, such as greying ha ir and wrinkles, will be accompanied by less obvious, but progressive deterioration of bodily systems, (such as bone thinning, and stiffening of the arteries), and gradual increased susceptibility to disease and death. The process of ageing is still not f ully understood, but it is felt that there are many mechanisms involved. One of the most favourite theories is that the formation of \"free radicals\", (a by -product of the body's use of oxygen), causes damage at cellular level, and the ability of the indivi dual's maintenance and repair systems to counter this process determines how quickly a person ages. With ageing, there is an increased risk of death, due to internal and/or external factors. However, individuals vary greatly in the rate at which they age, and how they age, which is genetically determined, and it is important to bear this in mind when considering the older person's functional ability. An older person's unique characteristics of genetic makeup and lifestyle may render them much more healthy than a person 20 years younger. Several other factors, which are not intrinsic, may influence the rate of ageing. Lifestyle features, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and cigarette smoking can exacerbate osteoporosis, atrophy of muscles, and reduced lung function, for example. Where you live (that is, in a developed world country or a third world country, as well as how advantaged is your local community), is important as well as other environmental factors, such as exposure to toxins and infections, a nd psychological issues, such as depression (with resultant lack of motivation to live a healthy lifestyle). Many species have a set lifespan; the maximum possible lifespan for humans is 120 years. Life expectancy in the developed world is now 80 years for females, and 75 years for males. The percentage of elderly people in the population is rising, and also the numbers of elderly people, with implications for the amount of chronic and degenerative diseases in the population, as a whole, in the fu ture. Normal ageing \"Normal\" ageing is ageing which occurs without disease, that is there are a number of physiological changes, that do not involve a pathological process, and, though there may be bodily changes in the person, the person enjoys good fun ction of mind and body, and is able to live independently, and with a good quality of life. The impact of normal ageing A situation, which would have a minor effect on a younger person (such as an operation on a lower limb), may have considerable effects on an elderly person because the enforced bed rest may cause pressure sores (the skin is thinner, more fragile, and less well able to heal). Also, the bones and joints may become stiffer because of disuse therefore taking longer to return to their usual s tate. Following an operation, older people are also more susceptible to chest or wound infections (reduced immunity), confusion or even psychosis. Ageing & disease In many older people, the ageing process is compounded by overt disease, which may affect functional capacity, quality of life and independence, cause frailty, a reduction in well being and independence and which may result in increased care and mobility needs. Some of the commonest disease processes affecting older people are described below: Nervous System (Physical) Parkinson's disease Strokes - paralysis/weakness Epilepsy often as a result of a stroke Nervous system (mental) Depression Cognitive impairment (Alzheimer's, diffuse vascular disease) Confusion - acute or chronic Paranoia Cardiovascular Ischaemic heart disease Peripheral vascular disease Aortic stenosis and Valvular heart disease Arrhythmias/such as atrial fibrillation) Varicose Veins Skin Pressure sores Delayed wound healing Varicose ulcers Easy bruising Immune System Increased prevalence of cancers Increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases Increased infection Genitourinary Prostatic enlargement Incontinence (weak bladder) Lungs COPD (Chronic bronchitis usually from smoking and mining Bronchiectasis Lung Fibrosis (Silicosis & Asbestosis) Bones Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid Arthritis Joint problems Foot problems Osteoporosis and fracture Metabolic Adult - onset diabetes (NIDDM) Thyroid disease - hyper or hypothyroidism Incontinence Many elderly people not only have problems with d isturbance of urinary function but have problems with incontinence. It affects around 50% of residents in care homes [and is often a reason for institutionalisation because of the extra burden it imposes on carers] and around 30% living at home. It causes a great deal of embarrassment and can significantly limit the person's lifestyle. The four main types of incontinence are: - Stress Urge Overflow Functional Stress incontinence: - Urinating regularly to avoid a full bladder, Kegel (pelvic muscle) exercises, Oestrogen tablets or cream, Surgical procedures (lift bladder and tighten blad der outlet). Usually occurs in women, as a result of weakness of muscles in the pelvis or at the neck of the bladder. It results in leakage of urine in certain specific situations, such as when coughing, laughing, sneezing or during exercise. It tends to affect older women, particularly after the menopause and the tendency may be increased by stresses to the pelvic muscles during childbirth many years ago. Urge incontinence: - Regular urination, Pelvic muscle exercises, Drugs to relax the bladde r (such as Oxybutinin). Is the result of instability of the bladder muscles, and is more common in older people. It results in an urgent need to pass urine at frequent intervals both day and night; incontinence results if there is delay in reaching a toil et or suitable receptacle. Urge incontinence may result from a problem with the bladder itself, or it may arise as a consequence of damage to the central nervous system and nerves controlling bladder function. Overflow incontinence: - Surgery to treat a blockage, Drugs to relax bladder outlet, Manual pressure on abdominal wall, Catheterisation. Occurs when the bladder fails to empty completely; urine builds up and in the end overflows resulting in either intermittent or continuous dribbling. It may result from obstruction to the neck of the bladder, as occurs in older men due to enlargement of the prostate gland at the base of the bladder. It may also result from disease or injury of the brain or spinal cord, e.g. multiple sclerosis, traumatic par aplegia, which affects the nerves that control bladder function. In such cases there may be complete lack of control of bladder function. Functional incontinence: - Regular toileting, Physical and psychological support. Is the passing of urine in inappr opriate places. It may be a result of varying degrees of immobility, for example making it difficult or impossible for the person to reach a toilet or to manage their clothing. It may also be the result of disturbed mental function, e.g. dementia, severe b ehaviour disorders, in which normal awareness of acceptable social behaviour is lost. These factors may be alleviated considerably with treatment. Clinical features of normal ageing Cardiovascular system Muscles Immune system Genito -urinary system Liver Sensory - Ears Sensory - Eyes Lungs Bones Nervous system Skin Cardiovascular system There are various effects of ageing in the cardiovascular system, which include: - A slightly enlarged heart, which does not pump as efficiently during exercise. Stiffer arteries. Isolated systolic hypertension (where the blood pressure rises when the heart contracts). Muscles There is a decrease in muscle strength and power, and lean body mass (up to 30 to 40%), and an increase in fat body mass, with ageing. The process is known as sarcopenia, and results in decreased functional capacity. Immune system The immune system changes, and becomes more dysfunctional. There is an age - related decline in a particular cell, which combats infection, and this is a consequence of shrinkage, and greatly reduced function of the thymus gland (behind the breastbon e or sternum). Infectious disease, such as bronchopneumonia and influenza, is up to 10 times more likely to be the cause of death in older people, and people are more likely to have a reactivation of certain diseases such as shingles, and tuberculosis. Th ere is an increase in occurrence of autoimmune diseases and cancers. Genito -urinary system By the age of 80 years, between 10 to 30% of the glomeruli in the kidneys, (which filter waste products from the blood) no longer work. 25% of the kidney mass is lost, due to shrivelling of the outer part of the kidney. Generally the kidneys are still able to regulate the fluid levels in the body, and reduced function will only be apparent in times of stress to the body. Benign enlargement of the prostate gland occ urs in 25 to 50% of men over 65 and this leads to incomplete emptying of the bladder and a weak stream of urine, or signs of irritation with frequency of urination. Because of age - related atrophy of the uro -genital system in females, there is more suscept ibility to urinary and vaginal infections. Liver Though there is a 25% reduction in the mass of the liver, function remains within normal limits, protein (albumin) production is slightly reduced, and there is an impaired metabolism of some drugs through t he liver. Sensory - Ears There is impaired hearing in a third of over - 65's and 80% of 80 year - olds and this is known as presbyacusis -decline in hearing with age is a very common age - related change. Loss of high - frequency sounds occurs first, and hea ring loss is more common in older men than women. Degenerative changes in the inner ear may also lead to some impairment of balance, resulting in falls, which again is a common problem in older people. Sensory - Eyes Normal Age - Associated Changes in the Eyes: - The lens stiffens, and this causes presbyopia (difficulty in focussing on near objects) and from around the age of 40, people find that they need reading glasses to focus easily, The retina becomes less sensitive to light, which causes older peopl e to have difficulty seeing in low or dim light, and to distinguish objects of low contrast from each other, The pupils react more slowly, which means that an older person has difficulty adjusting to changes in light levels. This could result in difficulty with night driving, Peripheral and colour vision may become less sensitive with age. A change in peripheral vision is due to a smaller pupil, more opaque lens and less sensitive retina, while colour perception is a result of yellowing of the lens, which o ccurs with age. Lungs The changes in the ageing lung (in healthy older people) are similar to the changes seen in mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with decreased elastic recoil of the lung tissue, stiffening of the chest wall, weakening of the muscles of respiration, resulting in reduced lung volumes and flow rates. The ability to exercise is reduced by around a third, between the ages of 20 and 70. Bones Osteoporosis (thinning of bones) is a reduction of bone mass with a deterioration of bone tissue, causing increased fragility of the bones, and a susceptibility to fracture. Women are especially affected after the menopause; osteoporosis affects men more slowly. With increasing age, blood calcium comes from bone more than from diet. Calcium supplements can be very helpful in this age group and along with vitamin D has been noted to reduce incidence of falls in patients living in residential homes. Nervous system There is a decline in performance, and many changes occur in both the central and p eripheral nervous system. Some are: - A decrease in the size and mass of the brain, Loss of neurones (nerve cells) with fewer connections in both the brain and spinal cord, Slower thought processes, Slower reaction time, Decreased vibration and position sense, Reduced sensitivity to temperature changes. Skin There is the formation of wrinkles, thinning and reduced strength, and elasticity of the skin. It is more fragile and more susceptible to damage. Wound healing takes longer. The fat layer ge nerally lessens, but fat accumulates in particular areas (stomach, under the chin). Pigment cells are fewer but clump together, giving an appearance of paler skin with age spots. The skin is drier and more susceptible to flakiness, sense of pain is lessen ed and temperature regulation is less efficient. Hair and nail growth slows down, hair thins, nails thicken and become more yellow. The skin is less able to withstand infections and malignant change as the immune function declines. Skin becomes dry, itchy and bruises more easily. Effects of multiple conditions As people get older they are more likely to have multiple pathology (that is, to suffer from more than one condition), which can have considerable impact on their care and mobility needs. For instan ce, a person may have weakness or paralysis of one side of the body because of a stroke, which affects walking ability but this will be compounded if the person has co -existing osteo -arthritis of the hip. The overall disabling effect will be worse than the sum of the effects of each condition. Side effects of treatment Older people are more likely to be on medication for more than one condition, (poly -pharmacy) and, apart from the side effects of the medication there is the likelihood of interactions from the medication combinations and the effects of medications on existing physical conditions. Examples are: - ACE Inhibitors in older people may induce a profound fall in blood pressure, and should be introduced with caution, especially if they are alread y taking diuretics. Older people are more susceptible to collapsing and falling, than younger persons. There are other factors involved in why they fall, but medicines may also play a role, for example: They are more likely to be taking diuretics, therefor e have electrolyte imbalance, or have impaired kidney function. If a person has congestive heart failure, the impact of diuretic use would be much greater in a person who has urinary problems (for example, incontinence of urine, or frequency and poor stre am, due to enlargement of the prostate gland) than one who has not. Case example Mr Jones is 85 years old and lives alone in a two -storey house. He sleeps upstairs but has great difficulty getting to bed because of severe osteo - arthritis of his left hip and the effects of a stroke 2 years previously causing mild, left -sided weakness. His doctor has aggressively treated his raised blood pressure to try to reduce the chance of further stroke but this results in giddy spells, particularly when he rises. This happens because of postural hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure) when changing posture to a standing position. He suffered a fractured wrist last year and he was noted to have osteoporosis. During one night, he got out of bed quickly, as he needed to pass urine urgently. He felt dizzy and tripped over a loose rug onto his left hip causing extensive grazing, bruising and a fracture of the hip. He could not get up and lay on the floor overnight, which caused pneumonia (lung infection). Back to A - Z Falls in older people Introduction Causes of Falls Effects of falls Risk factors associated with falls Prevention of falls Introduction Elderly people are more prone than younger people to unpredictable and unexpected falls. Falls are common in older people and the risk of falling i ncreases with increasing age. Falls affect a third of those aged 65 years and over rising to over 40% in those aged 80 years and above. A fall may be the result of a simple \"trip\" in which case the environment needs to be looked at, in order to reduce haz ards such as wet and slippery floors, loose rugs and poor lighting but often in the elderly, a fall may be caused by a combination of several factors. A condition may present itself in an unusual way in an older person [for instance, infection, transient ischaemic attack, heart disease] and the poor general condition of the person may manifest itself in a fall or it may be the result of very poor compensatory mechanisms to maintain balance such as stiff and arthritic joints, weak muscles and slower reflexes . There are many risk factors associated with falls in older people and a combination of apparently trivial factors may \"tip the balance\" in an older person, who, as well as manifesting the effects of \"normal\" ageing may also be frail and/ or have a disea se condition such as Parkinson's Disease, in which gait is already affected (short, shuffling steps and altered centre of gravity). Also, the more risk factors the person has, the higher the risk of falling. Causes of Falls Weakness and frailty Medication side effects Musculo - skeletal: - Arthritis, Stiffness of joints, Weak muscles, Giving way of knee, Heart problems: - Drop attacks, Arrhythmias, Blood pressure drops on changing position, Deconditioning due to immobility. Medication side effec ts, Syncope. Vision defects including cataracts and reduced visual fields. Mental Health: - Alzheimers disease, Confusion, Paranoia, Psychosis, Medication side effects. Neurological: Epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson's disease. Environment: - Poor lighting, Rugs, Stairs, Steps, Walking frames. Reduced position and vibration sense. Other factors: - Use of stick, Previous falls. Slow reactions Effects of falls Falls are not only more likely to happen in older people but they are also more likely to result in serious injury. Elderly people are not as well able to save themselves from a fall as younger people. They are less stable with slower reflexes and are therefore less effective in preventing falls. Injury Approximately one in ten falls results in serious injury and 10% of visits to hospital emergency are as a consequence of falls. The most common fractures are fractured hip or femur (thigh bone) and Colles fracture (involving the end of the forearm) but other serious injuries can occur such as skull fracture, head injury, sub -dural haematoma, (bleeding on the brain following a head injury) other fractures and soft - tissue injuries. Burns can be sustained if he/she falls against a radiator and is then unable to move. Fracture of the femu r is an example of a very serious complication of a fall as it involves hospitalisation, surgery and a convalescent period. The treatment can itself be complicated by an adverse reaction to the anaesthetic, infection of the wound, post - operative pneumonia , immobility and pressure sores, slow and delayed recovery, pain and stiffness of the hip joint and reduction of future activity for fear of further falls. The consequences of the fall itself may be made more serious by a delay in discovery when the person stays on the floor or ground for a long time and this can lead to hypothermia (especially in the winter) or dehydration from lack of fluids. The time from injury to discovery may be the difference between life and death. Immobility, mental and soci al The average person of 70 to 80 years is now much fitter than ever before. Continuing activity and exercise helps maintain muscular strength, balance, joint position sense and the strength of bones. However, a hidden and often under -recognised consequenc e of falls is fear, loss of confidence and restriction of activities in order not to put themselves in the position of risking further falls. The person may seriously restrict outings, hobbies and activities such as attending religious services. This can l ead to detrimental effects such as social isolation, loneliness and immobility leading to further reduced strength and muscle tone and stiffer joints. Because of a limitation of lifestyle and being confined to the home, the person can become very depressed and withdrawn. Frequent falls and the fear of further incidents may cause the elderly person to be admitted into long -term care. This may not be the ideal solution as the environment may well have its own hazards (polished floors, unfamiliar bathrooms, r ugs, steps and stairs) with which the person will not be familiar leading to an increased risk of falls and the loss of independence. This change of circumstances (including distance from important relatives) may lead to serious depression, decline and ult imately death. Effects of falling Physical Mental Social Bruising, Fracture (especially femur), Brain haemorrhage, Burns (fall against a radiator), Dehydration, Pneumonia, Death, Immobility causing reduced activity,loss of muscle tone, stiffer joints. Depression, Loss of confidence, Fear, Restriction of lifestyle. Inability to leave home (real or imagined), Long term care, Inability to travel, Inability to follow hobbies. Risk factors associated with falls Mental health Neurological factors Weakness and frailty Heart / circulatory problems Vision defects Environmental factors Musculo -skeletal factors Other factors Mental health Mental and intellectual proces ses are altered by ageing and may be manifested in various ways but there is considerable individual variation. Short - term memory may be affected with difficulty in remembering new information or recalling recent events, though long -term memory will be unaffected. There may be less problem -solving ability, slower reaction times and speech may be slower. There may be more caution and rigidity in personality and attitudes. Elderly people may be \"confused\". This may be as a result of dementia, cerebro -vascular disease affecting the brain [\"hardening of the arteries\"], mental illness such as depression or chronic diseases such as COPD with chronic oxygen lack. This may be demonstrated on the \"Mini Mental Score Examination (MMSE). More severe ment al illness such as psychosis may be present where reality and fiction are blurred, there is no real concept of time and day may be confused with night. An elderly person who is not normally confused may suffer \"acute confusion\" in response to a specific ev ent such as hospital admission, operation or an infection such as a urinary tract infection or pneumonia. The effects of medication can also put elderly people at risk. Sedative drugs such as sleeping pills are particularly important. Anti -depressants and sedatives may slow the reaction - time and thus may prevent the older person from responding quickly or appropriately. Drugs, which lower the blood pressure either intentionally e.g. medication for high blood pressure or as a side effect e.g. water tablet s (diuretics), may cause a fall in blood pressure on standing, making the elderly person feel dizzy and falls may result. Weakness and frailty Frail people are at risk of unpredictable falls because of a generally more vulnerable state and a combination o f factors, which lead to a predisposition to falling, being less able to avoid a fall and problems getting up unaided after a fall, which could lead to dangerous consequences, such as dehydration, hypothermia, pneumonia, fractures or sub -dural haematoma (b leeding on the brain). Vision defects Vision is often impaired in older people, (see \"Effects of Normal Ageing\"). It is not only the visual acuity and ability to focus but also contrast sensitivity (the ability to adapt to light changes) and peripheral vi sion, which may be affected. This reduces the ability to see hazards and avoid a fall. Musculo -skeletal factors In older people, changes in gait and balance can occur. With stiffness and pain in weight -bearing joints and weak musculature, (as a result of osteo - arthritis or from normal ageing) there is less ability to lift feet up properly (steps become short and shuffling) and a greater tendency to trip and stumble. A lower limb may be weak or paralysed (as the result of a stroke) and thinner bones (a resu lt of osteoporosis) are more likely to break. The feet themselves may have reduced sensation and/ or ulcers for example, as a result of diabetic neuropathy, alcoholism or medication. Neurological factors Neurological factors, which may lead to a danger of falling are: - Cerebro -vascular disease and stroke with resultant impaired gait and balance, Reduced position sense, Reduced vibration sense, Peripheral neuropathy, with loss of feeling in the feet, Slower reflexes, Slower reaction time, Abnormalities of gait, as in Parkinson's Disease, Dizziness, Epilepsy, Effects of medications. Falls are associated with the use of 4 or more medications at the same time, sedative - hypnotic drugs, especially long - acting benzodiazepines, some antidepressants and some major tranquillizers. Heart / circulatory problems Some heart / circulatory problems which can lead to falls are -: Arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, Heart block, Heart failure, Aortic stenosis, Syncope (faints) and low blood pressure on standing (postural hypotension). (All of these may cause a sudden loss of consciousness because of reduced blood circulating in the brain), Medications such as digoxin, diuretics, some anti -arrhythmics and some medications that reduce blood pressure for ex ample, ACE inhibitors. Environmental factors Many of these factors are hazardous, and can be changed to minimize risk to the person: - Steep stairs, Slippery surfaces such as polished and wet floors, Loose rugs, Trailing cords and flexes, Poorly - lit areas, Incorrect height of furniture, Unfamiliar environments. Measures such as the use of grab rails, raised toilet seats, installation of proper lighting and stair lifts (if necessary), the use of brightly - coloured strips around light switches and on th e edges of steps and the installation of personal and home alarms all help to minimize environmental risk and restore some confidence. Other factors Other factors to be considered are: - Previous falls (an elderly person who falls more than twice in a si x- month period should be evaluated for treatable causes). The use of mobility aids (stick or walking - frame), which may indicate some difficulty with mobility (but also the aid may be unsuitable or not safe). Prevention of falls Falls in older people are very often found to be multi -factorial. If an elderly person has had 2 or more falls in a 6 -month period, an evaluation of the person's health, environment and lifestyle should be undertaken with a view to removing treatable causes. This can b e done in specialist Falls Clinics where there is a multidisciplinary approach to the person, involving a team with special knowledge and expertise. Hazards in the home and environment can be modified, and safety features such as non - slip surfaces and gr ab rails installed. An occupational therapist is usually the appropriate person to assess home safety. An evaluation of medication is important especially if the person is taking four or more prescription medications, is on new medication or is taking medi cations, which have a sedative effect or are likely to cause a sudden drop in blood pressure. Reduced vision and hearing may be treated, as much as possible, and safety features such as good lighting, fluorescent safety strips put in to make the environmen t safer. Strength and balance training can be taught to optimise joint position sense, muscular strength and balance. A physiotherapist may do this or there may be special (exercise or Tai Chi) classes in some areas. Walking aids may not be used and may be needed to restore balance and confidence. Back to A - Z Frailty Introduction Needs in frailty Introduction A person who is frail is said to be \"physically weak and delicate (fragile)\". Frailty is defined as \"infirmity - the state of being weak in health and body (especially in old age)\". It is understood to be an increased vulnerability to loss of function whereas disability is actual loss of function. It is a loss of resilience and the loss of ability to withstand physical and psychological stressors. Frailty is a combination of factors and can occur in younger persons (but in these cases usually a disease process such as cancer or a condition such as Anorexia Nervosa is present). Dr Linda Fried produced the Fried Framework of Frailty and the definition suggested that for anyone to be considered frail, the person should have 3 or more of the following 5 factors: - Unintentional weight loss (10 pounds or more in a year). General feeling of exhaustion (as self - reported). Weakness (as measured by grip strength). Slow walking speed. Low levels of physical activity. Frailty occurs on a background of natural ageing and can be precipitated by a factor such as anaemia, joint pain or loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia). The domains whose functions are usually affected in frailty are: - Musculo -skeletal - such as reduced muscle mass [known as sarcopenia], joint pain as in art hritis (leading to reduction in activity, and immobility), polymyalgia rheumatica (painful hip and shoulder muscles with weakness). Cardio - respiratory - such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, anaemia, atherosclerosis and peripheral vascular disease. Cognitive - such as cognitive impairment, slower reaction times, depression, [leading to feelings of fatigue, and slower thought processes, reduced activity and motivation, and anorexia]. Balance and Gait (impaired balance can lead to an increased risk of falling, loss of confidence, and reduced mobility). Nutritional Status Anorexia - can often occur as part of the ageing process and also as a consequence of certain diseases such as COPD where eating becomes difficult due to lack of breat h. The consequence is chronic under - nourishment, vitamin deficiency and a decline in health. It is recognised that other factors play a part, and these can include: Diabetes mellitus. Chronic diseases (such as congestive cardiac failure, COPD). Endocrin e disorders (such as hyper and hypothyroidism, adrenal gland dysfunction and low testosterone levels (testosterone builds up muscle tissue). Pain (leading to restriction of movement and depression). Needs in frailty The Canadian Study of Health and Agein g describes frail people as below (category 4,5,6 and 7). Category Definition Category 1 Very fit (the most fit) Category 2 Well (without active disease) Category 3 Well, with treated (well - controlled) co -morbid disease Category 4 Apparently Vulnerable -although not frankly dependent, these people commonly complain of being \"slowed down\", or have disease symptoms. Category 5 Mildly Frail - with limited dependence on others for instrumental activities of daily living. Category 6 Moderately Frail - help is needed with both instrumental and non - instrumental activities of daily living. Category 7 Severely Frail - completely dependent on others for the activities of daily living, or terminally ill. (From the CSHA Clinical Frailty S cale, CMAJ) Other studies have used a frailty index, obtained by comprehensively assessing physical, psychological and mental health and function. In the assessment of a frail elderly person and their needs, all factors need to be taken into consideration including: - Medical history and present state of health. Current medications and side effects/ interactions. Social circumstances and level of support needed (for example, social isolation, having to give up driving). Current level of functional ability (ability to self - care, and to get about). Physical and mental state, including musculo -skeletal, cardiovascular, cognitive, balance and gait, and nutritional status. A multidisciplinary approach with information from all professionals (doctor, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, carers, nurses and dietician) involved with the person is important in order to get an overall view. Frailty is common in older people and may be an indication of future prognosis (gradual decline and death ) but the process can be reversed by treating those conditions, which are not irreversible and which are a contributory factor to frailty. For example, loss of muscle mass can be reversed by an exercise programme, which builds muscular strength. Poor eatin g habits may be changed and anaemia can be treated by the appropriate medication. Back to A - Z Audiological Reports An Audiological report (audiogram) is a technical assessment to establish the extent of a customer's deafness. An audiogram demonstrates the level of hearing loss at different frequencies and shows whether the hearing loss is due to a conductive, sensorineural or mixed cause. The level of disability in the CCM guidance is based on audiograms carried out without hear ing aids being worn by the customer. An audiological report can be used as further evidence when a customer claims the DLA higher rate mobility component because of a combination of hearing loss and blindness (deaf / blind deeming provisions). Departme ntal Decision Makers can request an Audiological report but only when the customer has not had an Audiogram in the last six months. Back to A - Z Care Programme Approach (CPA) Introduction The term Care Programme Approach (CPA) has been used since 1990 to describe the framework that supports and co -ordinates effective mental health care for people with severe mental health problems in secondary mental health services. Where a service user has straightforward needs and has contact with only one agency then an appropriate professional in that agency will be the person responsible for facilitating their care. Formal designated paperwork for care planning and the review process for these service users, is not required. However , a statement of care agreed with the service user should be recorded. This could be done in any clinical or practice notes, or in a letter, and this documentation will constitute the care plan. From October 2008, the term Care Programme Approach describ es the approach used in secondary mental health care to assess, plan, review and co -ordinate the range of treatment, care and support needs for people in contact with secondary mental health services who have complex characteristics (as outlined below). It is called an \"approach\", rather than just a system, because the way that these elements are carried out is as important as the actual tasks themselves. Active service user involvement and engagement will continue to be at the heart of the approach, as wil l a focus on reducing distress and promoting social inclusion and recovery. Who will need CPA? In the main, the individuals needing the support of CPA should not be significantly different from those who needed the support of enhanced CPA in the past. The current characteristics of those needing enhanced CPA are described as individuals who need: multi -agency support, active engagement, intensive intervention, support with dual diagnoses and who are at higher risk. CPA and eligibility for services The lis t in the table below is used to decide if, having been accepted as needing secondary mental health services, further support is needed with engagement, co -ordination and risk management (i.e. needing CPA). Characteristics used to decide if CPA support is needed Severe mental disorder (including personality disorder) with high degree of clinical complexity Current or potential risk(s), including: Suicide, self harm, harm to others (including history of offending) Relapse history requiring urgent response Selfneglect/non concordance with treatment plan Vulnerable adult; adult/child protection e.g. exploitation e.g. financial/sexual financial difficulties related to mental illness disinhibition physical/emotional abuse cognitive impairment child pro tection issues Current or significant history of severe distress/instability or disengagement Presence of non -pjhysical co -morbidity e.g. substance/alcohol/prescription drugs misuse, learning disability Multiple service provision from different agencies, including: housing, physical care, employment, criminal justice, voluntary agencies Currently/recently detained under Mental Health Act or referred to crisis/home treatment team Significant reliance on carer(s) or has own significan t caring responsibilities Experiencing disadvantage or difficulty as a result of: Parenting responsibilities Physical health problems/disability Unsettled accommodation/housing issues Employment issues when mentally ill Significant impairment of function due to mental illness Ethnicity (e.g. immigration status; race/cultural issues; language difficulties; religious practices); sexuality or gender issues Social Services (Social Care and Health) Care Plan Services are provided for customers who may have physical, sensory or learning disability or are an older person. They can provide the following services: - Specialist advice and information Help to manage personal care in the customer's own home Help with meals Equipment and adaptations to help the customer live at home Disabled parking scheme (blue badge) Support for the visually impaired or the deaf of hard of hearing Information about other services and organisations who can help Social Services (Social Care and Health) can arrange services to help the customers with daily living tasks so that they are as independent as possible. A specially trained assessor gathers the information and this assessment forms the basis of planning how the customers needs can be met and a Care Plan is developed. The Care plan describes: - Who is responsible for providing services What they have agreed to do When they will do it Who is responsible for making sure things go according to plan The names of key people and how to contact them Services may no t always be provided by Social Services (Social Care and Health), they may arrange for private or voluntary agencies to do so on their behalf. A copy of the Care Plan is given to the customer and a copy should be obtained as it is important that the Depar tmental Decision Maker is aware of the details of the arrangements in place for the individual. Back to A - Z Examining Health Care Professional (EHCP) Reports A Health Care Professional (HCP) is a practitioner involved with patie nt care. This would include doctors, nurses, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. They will have received training in disability assessment medicine. In addition they are instructed in the assessment of care and mobility needs relating to the enti tlement to DLA/AA. An EHCP report will provide details of the diagnosis (where known), brief history of the condition, treatment, a record of clinical examination, severity and likely disabling effects of the condition on day -to-day living. The EHCP repo rt is able to provide a critical appraisal of whether a person's claimed care and mobility needs are reasonable in the light of the disabling condition(s). An EHCP report can be particularly helpful in situations where the existing medical evidence (usual ly factual reports) appear to be contradictory, or where factual reports do not appear to cover areas relevant to entitlement. When the Departmental Decision Maker decides to request an EHCP report, it is worth considering the exact nature of the informat ion required and to formulate a submission with some specific questions for the HCP. It may also be useful to enclose copies of factual reports, especially if existing evidence is contradictory. Back to A - Z The Educational Psychology Service What is an Educational Psychologist? Educational Psychologists (EP's) provide guidance and support to schools on a range of issues including Special Educational Needs (SEN). They work with parents, carers and teachers to ide ntify and support the SEN of individual children at home and at school. All EP's have qualifications in Psychology and Educational Psychology and are not usually medically qualified. They may also be qualified teachers with teaching experience. What doe s their work include? EP's help children from Nursery school to age 19. They assess how best to help by observing and working with children at home and at school. The EP works closely with parents and school staff to plan a programme of support. Usually the Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCo) at school will contact an EP after deciding the child might benefit from their help. The school then contacts parents for permission to provide the specialist support. Parents / carers, the school and the EP review the plan to make sure the child's needs are being met. Back to A - Z General Practitioner Reports (GP Reports) GPs are the first point of contact for people with a health condition and provide ongoing care to their patients. They are responsible for diagnosing and treating illnesses and may refer the patient to hospital for specialised care, in which case a report is usually sent back to the GP. GPs will have long term knowledge of the patient and hold the patient' s records including hospital correspondence. GPs generally are not trained and do not assess a patient's function and are therefore not usually in a position to give information about their patients' ability to perform daily living activities. It is reas onable to expect a GP's report to contain factual information such as diagnosis, history of the condition, clinical findings, results of special tests, medication and treatment plan. The GP may have very limited information on people who have had stable, long-term disabilities, often since childhood, for example children and adults with learning disabilities. Claimants with mental health problems or learning disabilities may be mainly under the care of community psychiatric services or other specialist tea ms and it is often more appropriate to make an initial request for a factual report from another agency or professional. Back to A - Z Health Care Professional The term ''health care professional'' means an individual who has had specialised training to provide health care items or services, treatment, assistance with activities of daily living or medications to patients. Hospital Departments/Specialism The table below lists the names of Hospital Departments and the types of conditions / services that they are responsible for treating / providing.

Back to A - Z Hospital Reports National Health Service hospitals and trusts are required by the NHS Executive to provide factual reports incidental to the claimant's treatment when requested by the Benefits Agency. The hospitals or their employees are not paid on an individual basis for the reports. It is the responsibility of the hospital or trust management to ensure that the information is supplied. Although patients are under the care of a des ignated consultant, this doctor does not necessarily have to complete the report. An alternative member of the medical team, another consultant or other healthcare professional may carry out the task. The hospital report will contain information obtained from the medical records and the professional's knowledge of the patient. It will consist of detail relating to diagnosis, special tests, clinical findings, medication etc. A hospital doctor will not have the background knowledge to answer specific questions relating to the criteria for benefit entitlement. Hospitals are likely to be the most appropriate source of information when the medical diagnosis is uncommon or treatment is very specialised. Back to A - Z Individual Education Plan The child's teacher is responsible for working with the child on a day to day basis, but may decide to write down the actions of help in an IEP. The IEP will include details of the conditions g iving rise to the child's needs and could also include -: what special or additional help is being given who will provide the help and how often what help the child could be given at home the child's targets how and when progress will be checked Other na mes for an IEP, which may also be used, are -: Individual Behaviour Plans (IBP), Individual Behaviour Management Plans (IBMP), Behaviour Support Plan (BSP), and Behaviour Target Report (BTR). Formal reviews of the plan should be held at least twice a yea r. Name Stage Area/s of concern Yr group IEP No Class Teacher Start date Supported by Review date Proposed support Support began Targets to be achieved Achievement criteria Possible Resources and Techniques Possible strategies to use in class Ideas for support teacher / assistant Parents / carers need to Student needs to Back to A - Z Medical Services Doctors The doctors employed by Medical Services are particularly skilled and knowledgeable in the field of medical disability analysis. Most carry out regular examinations for benefit including the Personal Capability Assessment, Severe Disablement Allowance, Industrial Injury Disablement Benefit and DLA/AA. They also train contrac ted doctors to carry out the above types of examination and monitor the reports of these doctors, providing further training if needed. Advice is given to Departmental Decision Makers on request in all the benefit strands. Medical Service doctors also l iase with general practitioners, hospital doctors and other external bodies with regard to individual claims or other benefit matters. Their experience in all strands of the medical benefits enhances their expertise in interpreting the effects of function al impairment across a wide range of disability. Medical Services doctors can advise Decision Makers in a number of ways: They can identify who is likely to be the best person to approach for a medical report, whether a doctor or other healthcare profess ional and provide advice on the basis of the reply. They can explain and interpret medical terminology in all types of medical reports. This can include the nature of diagnoses, the use of medication, the meaning of clinical examination findings and the l ikely disabling effects of any given condition. They will be able to interpret clinical information, analyse it and describe the extent of care or mobility restrictions likely to arise from a specific medical or disabling condition. They can identify inc onsistencies or contradictions in the evidence and advise if further evidence is likely to be useful. They can give advice regarding response to treatment and prognosis. Back to A - Z Common Medical Tests Bruce Protocol Coronary Angiography Endoscopic Examination of the GI Tract Spirometry Tests Peak Flow Meters The Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale Bruce Protocol (Treadmill Exercise) Test Formal exercise testing is undertaken when the diagnosis of angina needs to be confirmed in suspected individuals and indeed the severity of the coronary disease. A standard treadmill or, more rarely, a bicycle ergometer is used and a formal exercise test (ETT) is performed. It is carried out according to a standard protocol. The patient walks on the treadmill, which has a varying speed (which c an be altered, i.e. made faster or slower) and a variable gradient (slope), which can mimic going uphill or upstairs. (The Bruce Protocol is a description of the protocol for the increments in speed and gradient in the treadmill test). During the time of testing, continual monitoring of the patient's general condition, ECG and blood pressure take place. A specialist must supervise and full resuscitation facilities must be available. The patient stops when chest pain or discomfort occurs, or when advised to, by the Specialist. For the Full (Standard) Bruce Protocol, each stage lasts 3 minutes and the speed and gradient are increased at each stage. For the modified Bruce Protocol, the gradient, but not the speed, is increased at each stage (see ta ble). Specific ECG changes indicate myocardial ischaemia. The modified test is used in cases where standard testing would be too strenuous for the patient. The patient may not be able to participate in exercise testing because of co -existing problems (i .e. severe OA of the hip, or severe chronic obstructive airways disease). Modified Bruce Protocol Stage Speed (Metres per Min) Gradient Duration (Min) Cumulative Time (Min) Cumulative Distance (Metres) I 46 0 3 3 138 2 46 5 3 6 276 3 46 10 3 9 414 4 67 12 3 12 615 If the patient can complete Stage 1 of the test they are able to walk 138 metres on the flat. Coronary Angiography Coronary angiography is performed in order to demonstrate the exact anatomy of the coronary arteries, usually with a view to progression to PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) with or without stents, or CABG (coronary artery bypass graft). Indications for angiography are: - Where the diagnosis is not clear, Angina not responding to medic al therapy, Strongly positive exercise test according to the Bruce Protocol, Moderate or severe angina, Unstable angina (very severe angina), After an infarct (M.I), if well enough. Endoscopic examination of the GI Tract Sigmoidoscopy Sigmoidoscopy is a special internal investigation of the lower third of the large bowel (colon). An instrument called a sigmoidoscope is inserted via the anus and allows direct visual examination of back passage (rectum) and the sigmoid and descending colon (the last part o f the colon). The sigmoidoscope is a small camera attached to a flexible tube about twenty centimetres long (flexible sigmoidoscope). In some circumstances a rigid tube is used (rigid sigmoidoscope). The sigmoidoscope allows the operator to see any blee ding, inflammation, abnormal growths or ulcers in the colon and rectum. During the procedure the operator is also able to remove small samples of any abnormal tissue identified (biopsy) for more detailed examination under the microscope to confirm diagnosi s. Colonoscopy Colonoscopy is a special investigation that permits internal examination of the entire large bowel (colon). A long flexible fibro -optic tube, the colonoscope, is inserted via the anus and slowly guided through the large bowel under sedation . The colonoscope transmits pictures of the inside of the bowel on to a video screen. The operator is able to visualize any bleeding, inflammation, abnormal growths or ulcers in the colon. Abnormal growths arising from the inner surface of the bowel, such as polyps, can be removed via the colonoscope. In addition small samples of any abnormal tissue identified (biopsy) may be removed for more detailed examination under the microscope to confirm diagnosis. Gastroscopy Gastroscopy is a special investigation that permits internal examination of the upper parts of the gastrointestinal tract. It allows direct examination of the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. The gastroscope is a long flexible fibro -optic tube that transmits pictures of the inside of the gut on to a video screen. It is passed from the mouth, via the throat, into the oesophagus and then on to the stomach and duodenum. The fibro -optic tube is also referred to as an endoscope and the examination as endoscopy. The operator is able to identify any abnormal inflammation, bleeding or growths, and to locate stomach or duodenal ulcers. Small samples of any abnormal tissues identified (biopsy) may be removed via the gastro scope for more detailed examination under the microscope to confirm diagnosis. Gastroscopy is commonly used investigate symptoms of dyspepsia and locate peptic ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. It also used to investigate inflammation in the oesophagus and to diagnose oesophageal and stomach tumours. Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) This is usually used for asthma. It is the maximum rate of air breathed out as hard as possible through a measuring device called a peak flow meter, (after a full breath taken in). The reading is measured in litres/minute (l/min). Three readings are taken and the best of three is recorded. A measured peak flow of less than 80% predicted indicates that airways obstruction is present but the diagnosis of asthma cannot be made on a single peak flow measurement as PFR may vary throughout the day as well as o n a day -to-day basis, a series of sets of readings should be considered. Also, having a normal one -off peak flow reading does not exclude asthma. Peak flow measurement is done very commonly, and many patients test their peak flows on a daily basis, having their own peak flow meters. They then may record the reading in a graph form, which then easily highlights any change especially morning and evening. It is a very easy test to do. GPs and Specialist Asthma nurses can do an on -the-spot reading to quickly c heck a patient's status. EU Standard for Peak flow Meters Background Studies have identified that existing scales on hand held mini -Peak Flow Meters are accurate in the mid range but at the high and low ends of the range they are less accurate, with a re sult that asthma may be under - diagnosed and treatment may not be optimal. As a consequence, a new EU standard has been introduced for mini peak flow meters, which is now in force. Any PF meter purchased or prescribed in the UK will from now on be EU standa rd compliant. Peak flow meters, which are well maintained, and in good condition can still, be used, since it is possible to apply an algorithm, which converts old to new readings. It is important to determine the type of meter with which the reading was taken. Therefore, when documenting Peak Flow, it should be recorded whether an existing \"Wright\" or new \"EU\" meter has been used, like this: PFR 450l/min (Wright) or PFR 450 (EU) Examples of comparable peak flow values are: WRIGHT (value in litres/minute) EU (value in litres/minute) 130 117 150 130 200 165 249 203 250 204 299 246 300 247 350 294 400 344 450 399 500 457 550 518 600 584 650 652 The average range for an adult for peak flow lies between PFR 450 (EU) and PFR 600 (EU) , but because the peak flow depends on age, gender, race and height, the measured result is compared to that predicted for a person's age, gender, and height, using special charts and the measurement is compared with what would be expected. Below are some approximate result ranges indicating the level of peak flow reduction. Male Peak Flow Reading range Mild peak flow reduction More than 300 litres per minute (l/min) Wright More than PFR 247 (EU) Moderate peak flow reduction 200 - 299 litres per minute (l/min) Wright PFR 165 (EU) to PFR 246 (EU) Severe peak flow reduction Less than 200 litres per minute (l/min) Wright Less than PFR 165 (EU) Female Peak Flow Reading range Mild peak flow reduction More than 250 litres per minute (l/min) Wright More than PFR 204 (EU) Moderate peak flow reduction 130 - 249 litres per minute (l/min) Wright PFR 117 (EU) to PFR 203 (EU) Severe peak flow reduction Less than 130 litres per minute (l/min) Wright Less than PFR 117 (EU) With the new EU values, a new Nomogram has been provided, which should be used to determine whether the claimant has mild, moderate or severe asthma. \"In men, readings up to100 litres/minute lower than predicted are within normal limits. For women, the equivalent fig ure is 85 litres / minute. Values are derived from Caucasian populations\". Special Peak Flow Monitoring The patient is asked to measure their peak flow on a peak flow meter, every morning and evening for 1 to 2 weeks, to measure variability. A variation between the morning and evening readings of more than 15% is diagnostic of asthma. Spirometry Test A Spirometry Test measures the volume of air blown out against time and gives more specific information about lung function. This is done by a special technician or specialist using a machine into, which the patient's age, gender, and height have been entered, so that a predicted value has already been made. The patient blows out into a mouthpiece connected to the machine, as fully and as long as possible, after a deep breath in. Various readings can then be taken and compared with the predicted values. It is the single best diagnostic test for patients with airflow limitation. All new diagnoses of COPD have to be tested to fulfil scores in the n ew GP General Medical Services contract. Most GPs are now becoming familiar with this and have nurses who perform spirometry and reversibility testing . A value is calculated for the amount of air blown out in one second (this is known as the \"Forced Expi ratory Volume\" or FEV1). This is divided by the total amount of air blown out until all air is expired (known as Forced Vital Capacity or FVC). This is expressed as a percentage value and a value of less than 70% indicates COPD. In asthma, the readings wi ll be reduced, returning to normal between episodes, and again, the recorded result would be compared with what is predicted (according to age, height and gender, by the machine) and the results are then printed out. Below are some approximate result ran ges indicating the level of reduced FEV1. These can only be considered approximate as factors such as height, age and weight are not considered. Male Spirometry reading range Mild reduction 2.5 litres or more Moderate reduction 1.5 to 2.49 litres Severe reduction Less than 1.5 litre Female Spirometry reading range Mild reduction 2.0 litres or more Moderate reduction 1.0 to 1.99 litres Severe reduction Less than 1.0 litre FEV1 and Functional restriction table This table shows the predicted FEV1 as a percentage figure and the likely level of corresponding functional restrictions. FEV 1 % predicted Severity of airflow obstruction (Post -bronchodilator) 80% Stage 1 - Mild 50-79% Stage 2 - Moderate 30-49% Stage 3 - Severe < 30% Stage 4 - Very severe* *Or FEV 1 < 50% with respiratory failure. [Adapted from updated NICE Guidance 2010] Please note that FEV 1 % predicted while indicative is not a perfect predictor of level of disability. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) This is the total volume of air breathed out by the person after a full inspiration (breath in) into a spirometer. This is not generally used as a diagnostic test in COPD. The FEV1 / FVC Ratio This is a useful diagnostic aid and is a measure of airflow limitation. Normally, the FEV1 / FVC ratio is approximately 75%. A value of below 70% is indicative of airflow obstructi on (obstructive airways disease). This could be either asthma or COPD. The difference is that asthma is reversed when a short -acting beta agonist such as salbutamol or terbutaline are used (this is known as reversibility), whereas COPD is not reversible. A value of between 70% and 75% is indicative of restrictive lung disease such as lung fibrosis, asbestosis etc. The Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale Although not strictly a test or investigation, this is a scale often quoted by General Practitioners in medical reports completed for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) / Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease (COAD). Please see the link below -: http://www.gp -training.net/protocol/respiratory/copd/dyspnoea_scale.htm Back to A - Z Note in Lieu A note in lieu is issued if, after a statutory assessment, the LEA decides that the needs can be met with the support being provided by the child's school. A Note in Lieu describes -: the child's special educational needs gives the reasons why a Statement has not been written provides suggestions for the school about how to meet the child's needs describes any non -educatio nal needs the child has and the support which might be helpful Copies of all the advice and reports received as part of the statutory assessment will be sent along with the Note in Lieu to parents / carers. The Note in Lieu will be used by the school to help them provide the most appropriate support for the child. The note contains advice which has been based on the assessment reports, but it is not a legally binding document. Explanation - in lieu means 'instead of' - in this case instead of a SSEN. Back to A - Z Occupational Therapists (OTs) The prime function of OTs is to maximise the independence of the patients through assessing their needs and prompting the restoration of the maximum use of function. As specialists in the provision of disability equipment they offer practical advice on adapting the environment to the needs of the individual. OTs will be found working in many areas of health care; learning disability, mental illness, geriatrics, physical disability, paediatrics, day care and rehabilitation centres. They work in a variety of settings including hospitals, day centres, claimant's own homes and residential accommodation. Their work focuses on enabling people to perform every day activities s uch as washing, dressing, cooking and shopping. They help people to readjust to independent living after discharge from hospital. Where OTs work with people with mental health disorders or learning disabilities, they prepare these patients to return to as full a life as possible in the community. This may involve psychology or behavioural programmes including group work, for example, desensitisation programmes for agoraphobia or social skills training for people with long - term mental disorders. Reports from Occupational Therapists Reports from occupational therapists can provide very useful information since they link disability to need. Sometimes OTs can prove difficult to identify as a source of information, especially if the patient is only seen on one or two occasions before discharge or in their own home. If an elderly person is assessed at home a copy of the report may be available in his or her general practice records. Claimants themselves may also have a copy of their assessment repo rt. Back to A - Z Physiotherapists A physiotherapist has expertise in preventing and treating diseases/disabilities, particularly in relation to the neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Physioth erapists have a major contribution to make in restoring independence after a traumatic incident such as a stroke or head injury, after major surgery such as amputation, joint replacement or organ removal. They also provide treatment for muscle, ligament, or tendon injuries, spinal conditions and rehabilitation after fractures. When a physiotherapist treats a person for a minor illness/injury e.g. ankle injury or mechanical low back pain, the course of treatment is relatively short -lived involving two to s ix sessions over a similar number of weeks. Treatment after a major surgery e.g. joint replacement or amputation will be more prolonged but will be finite in length. A few long -term disabilities may require continuing treatment on a regular basis, but thi s is not frequently the case. In these situations the patient may be able to carry out the exercises themselves or their carer is taught to do the procedure e.g. chest physiotherapy in cystic fibrosis. Review of posture, pattern of walking and mobility in general is very much part of the role, together with pain -reducing and muscle -strengthening techniques. Physiotherapists assess patients for and can prescribe appropriate aids. These include walking sticks, crutches, frames and wheelchairs. Other equipme nt might include TENS machine for pain relief, incontinence aids, splints, neck collars and calipers. Reports from Physiotherapists A report from a physiotherapist could be expected to contain a brief medical history, diagnosis of the disabling condition and details of clinical examination and treatment plan. Information about limb function and ability to walk with appropriate appliances will often be available. In milder conditions information will relate to a specific episode of treatment rel ating to the affected area of the body, and the report is unlikely to cover the disabling effects of other generalised conditions. Back to A - Z Special Educational Needs (SEN) School & early education settings place great importa nce on identifying SEN so they can help the child as early as possible. Children learn in different ways & can have different levels or kinds of SEN. So if a child has SEN, the school will increasingly, step by step, bring in specialist expertise to help w ith the difficulties they may have. The school must inform parents /carers if they start giving extra or different help to the child because of their SEN. The basic level of extra help is known as School Action & could be: A different way of teaching thi ngs Some extra help from an adult Using particular equipment like a computer or specialist desk. The equivalent in Scotland is called Additional Support Needs (ASN). The principle difference being not confined to children whose need for special attention arises from disability or learning difficulties but from a range of factors e.g. being in hospital, death of a close family member. Individual Education Plans (IEP) The child's teacher is responsible for working with the child on a day to day basis, but m ay decide to write down the actions of help in an IEP. The IEP could include: what special or additional help is being given who will provide the help & how often what help the child could be given at home the child's targets how & when progress will be checked Sometimes the school will not write an IEP but will record how they are meeting the child's needs in a different way, perhaps as part of the lesson plans. If the child does not make enough progress under School Action, the teacher or SEN coordina tor (SENCO) will ask for advice from other people outside the school. This could include a specialist teacher or a speech & language therapist. This kind of extra help is called School Action Plus. The equivalent in Scotland is called an Individualised Ed ucational Programme. There is no difference to the English IEP. Click here for more information about the Individual Education Plan Statement of Special Educational Needs (SEN) When SEN cannot be met by resources generally available to local schools, the assessment will identify the child's needs and any special help that is required and will be produced in the following format: Part 1 - Child's details (e.g. name, address, parent / carer) and a list of the advice the autho rity received as part of the assessment Part 2 - Gives details of the child's special educational needs Part 3 - Describes all the special help to be given for the child's needs Part 4 - Gives the type & name of the school the child should go to & how any arrangements will be made out of school hours or off school premises Part 5 - Describes any non -educational needs the child has Part 6 - Describes how the child will get help to meet any non -educational needs. A child's statement of Special Educational N eeds (SEN) should include mandatory information which Local Authorities (LAs) must request & consider when producing a statement of SEN. In addition to the actual statement, which will set out emotional & behavioural problems which may impact on learning a s well as other conditions & health problems, parents will also have the reports considered to assist the LA to produce the statement. This will always include a medical report, a report from Nursery / School & a report from the Educational Psychologist. Children who have learning support needs may not necessarily have a statement of SEN. The threshold for consideration of a statement is high & is variable from LA to LA. It may take several years before the LA accepts the need to prepare a statement even where a child clearly merits a statement being considered. Those children whose condition may impact on attendance but not their learning support would not have one e.g. a child being treated for cancer may miss a whole year of school but they would not have a statement because the health problems do not impact on learning ability, only attendance. Many children who have ADHD/ADD & other significant conditions may not have a statement because the condition does not impact sufficiently on their learning abilities. They would not usually have a statement unless they also had other conditions that impacted on their education such as dyslexia. If a child does have a statement, this is a reliable indicator that the child does require a high level of additional support because they have a significant condition. However, the absence of a statement does not mean that the child does not have a significant learning impairment. The equivalent in Scotland is called Co -ordinated Support Plan (CSP). There is no difference to the English statement of SEN. Click here for more information about the statement of Special Education Needs Note in Lieu If, after carrying out an assessment, the LEA decides not to draft a statement, they may i ssue a note in lieu. It may resemble a SEN but it has no legal force & does not necessarily provide any additional funding to meet the child's needs. Click here for more information about the Note in Lieu Transition Plan This is for children moving from Secondary school to further or higher education. It outlines what the child wants to achieve in the next few years & what support they will need to live as independently as possible. It covers every aspect of their life, inclu ding education, employment, housing, health, transport & leisure activities. Most plans are drawn up in year 9. The equivalent in Scotland is called Transition Planning / Future Needs Assessment. There is no difference to the English TP. Click here for m ore information about the Transition Plan Back to A - Z Social Workers The title social worker is currently used to describe a variety of people employed in the public, private and voluntary sectors. Th ere are great differences in the level of professional training and the type of work undertaken. The biggest employers of professionally qualified social workers are local authority Social Services Departments. The social workers may be based in fieldwork offices or in hospital. Some specialise in areas of work such as learning disabilities, mental health, physical disabilities, childcare and hearing and sight impairment. Social workers carry out assessments on disabled people to determine the level of ca re needed at home or the requirement for day care or residential services. These assessments will include information about the client's ability to do day -to-day tasks and to perform personal care. The social workers may work closely with occupational ther apists that are employed on the social work team by the same local authority. Residential social workers and day care workers are employed in residential settings and day care centres. A care co -ordinator may have specific responsibility for a particular client. Many are very experienced in their field of care but are not professionally qualified. They usually have detailed first hand knowledge of a client's disability and day -to-day functioning. Reports from Social Workers In those clients wi th disabilities who have undergone a formal assessment to determine the level of help which they need in their own homes or other residential settings the social worker can provide useful knowledge in determining benefit entitlement. Some of the informat ion will relate to activities such as the ability to shop or clean the home, which are not relevant to entitlement. In those with more severe disabilities evidence pertaining to personal care may be available. Residential social workers will be able to gi ve detailed information about care, including at night, similar to that provided by other relatives or carers living in the home. Back to A - Z Specialist Nurses Specialist nurses play a key role in the management of patient care. Working closely with doctors and other members of the multidisciplinary team, they educate and support patients, relatives and carers. The specialist nurse has in depth knowledge of the physical, psychological and social effects of a specific condition. Most specialist nurses are hospital based and have access to patient's medical records. Some will visit patients in their own homes following discharge from hospital. Some hospitals employ nurse specialists for: Blood disorders Gastro -enterological Gastro -intestinal Cardiac Respiratory Care the Elderly HIV/AIDS Incontinence Learning disability Oncology Neurology Pain Management Paediatrics Psychiatry Renal Medicine Skin Disease Community Psychiatric Nurses (CPNS) CPNs are specialist nurses with the treatment and care of people with mental health disorders. They work both in hospitals with inpatients and with outpatients in the community where they see patients in clinics or visit in their homes. CPNs work c losely with general practitioners, psychiatrists, social services and voluntary groups. Some specialise in drug and alcohol dependency. People with more severe mental health problems may be on supervised discharge from hospital and the community psychiatr ic nurse acts as the care co -ordinator. CPNs administer drug treatment by regular injection, monitor the effects of treatment, and carry out psychotherapeutic techniques such as behaviour therapy and counsel patients and their carers. Community Matrons Community matrons are highly experienced, senior nurses who work closely with patients (mainly those with a serious long term condition or complex range of conditions) in a community setting to directly provide, plan and organise their care. For further information click on the following link -: http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=1904 Reports from Specialist Nurses Reports form the specialist nurse can provide details of the diagnosis, brief medical history, clinical examination findings, medication, treatment plan and response, variability of the condition, disabling effects and prognosis. In people who have more than one medical condition, the specialist nurse may not be able to provide detailed information outside their own area of expe rtise or to be able to comment on multiple disabilities. Back to A - Z Statement of Special Educational Needs When Special Education Needs (SEN) cannot be met by resources generally available to local schools, the assessment will identify the conditions giving rise to needs, detail the child's needs and any special help that is required and will be produced in the following format: Part 1 - Child's details (e.g. name, address, parent / carer) and a list of the advice the authority received as part of the assessment Part 2 - Gives details of the child's special educational needs Part 3 - Describes all the special help to be given for the child's needs Part 4 - Gives the type & name of the school the child should go to & how any arra ngements will be made out of school hours or off school premises Part 5 - Describes any non -educational needs the child has Part 6 - Describes how the child will get help to meet any non -educational needs. The equivalent in Scotland is called Co -ordinated Support Plan (CSP). There is no difference to the English statement of SEN. Back to A - Z The statement of SEN Report Part 1.

Special Educational Needs This section will give details of the child's special needs. Part 3 .

Part 4 . Placement This section will name the school where the support will be made or the local authority's arrangements for support if this is not to be in school. Part 5. Non-Educational N eeds This section will give details of the relevant non -educational needs the child may have as agreed between health services, social services or other agencies and the local authority. Part 6. Non-Educational Provision This section will describe how the child will get the help required to support their non -educational needs. A child's statement of Special Educational Needs (SEN) should include mandatory information which Local Authorities (LAs) must request & consider when producing a statement. In addition to the actual statement, which will set out emotional & behavioural problems which may impact on learning as well as other conditions & health problems, parents will also have the reports considered to assist the LA to produce the s tatement of SEN. This will always include a medical report, a report from Nursery / School & a report from the Educational Psychologist. Children who have learning support needs may not necessarily have a statement. The threshold for consideration of a s tatement is high & is variable from LA to LA. It may take several years before the LA accepts the need to prepare a statement even where a child clearly merits a statement being considered. Those children whose condition may impact on attendance but not their learning support would not have one e.g. a child being treated for cancer may miss a whole year of school but they would not have a statement because the health problems do not impact on learning ability, only attendance. Many children who have ADH D/ADD & other significant conditions may not have a statement because the condition does not impact sufficiently on their learning abilities. They would not usually have a statement unless they also had other conditions that impacted on their education suc h as dyslexia. If a child does have a statement, this is a reliable indicator that the child does require a high level of additional support because they have a significant condition. However, the absence of a statement does not mean that the child does n ot have a significant learning impairment. Back to A - Z Transition (14+) Plan / Review.

Cerebral palsies are not specific diseases but are groups of disorders of varied causes and commonly associated with sensory defects (i.e. impairments of vision, or hearing, or touch, etc), learning difficulties and epilepsies. Cerebral palsi es affect one adult in 400. Cerebral palsies arise from abnormalities of brain development before birth or from damage to the brain in the womb, during birth or in infancy. The predominant features of the resulting disability are impairments in self - care, independent mobility and social interaction, which include communication. In late middle age, there is an increased risk of memory loss, dementia and osteoarthritis. Clinical Features Adults with cerebral palsies may show laborious movements due to spast icity (stiffness of muscles of the limbs). If this affects one side of the body it is called a hemiplegia, if it affects all 4 limbs it is called a quadriplegia, if it affects the mouth muscles it is called a bulbar palsy. Others show involuntary movements of a writhing (athetoid) and/or jerking nature (chorea). If there is unsteadiness or lack of balance this is known as ataxic cerebral palsy. Some people have mixed forms of cerebral palsy - e.g. ataxia and spasticity. Skeletal deformities are common e.g. curvature of the spine (scoliosis), dislocation or restricted mobility of the hip(s), deformities of the ankle or foot requiring use of appliances e.g. callipers or special footwear. About a third of adults with cerebral palsies have associated learning disability in the moderate to severe range. A further third have 'patchy' or specific learning disabilities (e.g. in literacy, numeracy or perception). The remainder are of normal intellectual ability or above average ability. In some the severity of the ph ysical disability (e.g. athetosis) may bear little relation to intelligence. Communication difficulties are common in adults with cerebral palsies; reasons include specific difficulties in comprehension or expressive language, impaired speech articulatio n and associated hearing loss, learning disability or autism. Augmented communication with symbol systems, word processor or a speech synthesizer may be used. Visual impairments are much more common than in the general population. Refractive error may be c orrectable by glasses. There may be retinal disorder in the eye, either from developmental disorders, damage by viral infection in the womb, cataracts or cortical visual impairment from developmental abnormality or damage to the brain. About 10 per cent o f adults with cerebral palsies have epilepsy, often severe. Life expectancy for adults with cerebral palsies depends on the type, severity and associated disabilities as well as the quality of care. It ranges from about 30 years for those with rigidity or severe spasticity associated with epilepsy and feeding difficulties, to 60 -70 years for those with moderate cerebral palsy, and to a normal life expectancy for those with mild disability and no associated impairments. Further Evidence Families of adults with cerebral palsies are often closely involved in their care and support and can provide much of the information required in determining care and mobility needs. Further evidence may be sought from the social worker, a therapist, the GP or a consultant i n rehabilitation medicine who has been involved in the management of the disabled person. Care Considerations About one third of adults with cerebral palsies may be expected to be independent and self -supporting with suitable education and support in childhood adolescence and early adult life. More severely affected people may require help with dressing and undressing, and with personal hygiene. Help may also be needed with cutting, mashing or blending food. Those most severely affected may be unable to fe ed themselves without help from another person. Mobility Considerations About 75% of adults with cerebral palsies can walk in the home and for varying distances out of doors. The manner in which progress is made, the gait adopted and the effort required may among other factors result in substantial limitations of walking abilities. Aids such as a walking stick, elbow crutches or a walking frame may be required, with a wheelchair for longer distances. Duration of Needs Care and mobility needs are ongoing in adult cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy - quadriplegia Spastic diplegia Cerebral palsy - athetoid Cerebral palsy - causing hemiparesis Cerebral palsy - ataxic Cerebral palsy - Other / type not known All information must be taken into acco unt when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

Adapted from the DHB - August 2011. Back to A - Z Compartment Syndrome Compartment syndrome is an acute condition affecting the mus cle compartments usually of the lower limb or forearm. It is caused by any condition that results in inflammation and swelling of the tissues inside the muscle compartments especially severe trauma . Common causes are crush injury, certain fractures and vascular injury. The swelling results in high pressure in tissue fluid around cells and the normal flow of oxygen and nutrients from bl ood is interrupted. If not treated quickly by decompression using a surgical operation called fasciotomy, many of these cells will die. This is called necrosis. Death of cells results in permanent disability. If treatment is instituted quickly there will be scarring but no disabling effects. Without treatment or delay in treatment there will be disabling effects related to death of muscle or nerve cells. In the leg there are likely to be visible changes in the appearance of the calf muscle and some moveme nts may not be possible because the appropriate muscle or its nerve is damaged, a good example of this is foot drop. This condition may be associated with disabling and difficult to treat pain syndromes relating to ischaemic nerve damage. Any resulting dis ability associated with this condition is permanent and may be called post compartment syndrome. In the arm, the most well known example of compartment syndrome is caused by fracture of the elbow in children. Acute swelling causes long term damage to t he muscles and nerves of the forearm. This typically ranges from flexion contracture of the fingers to complete paralysis of the forearm wrist and fingers. Long term damage caused by compartment syndrome after elbow fracture is called 'Volkmann's Ischaemic Contracture'. The effects of this condition should not be confused with exercise induced compartment syndrome. Impairment Award Period Compartment syndrome -: Treatment administered appropriately Delayed treatment / no treatment resulting in necrosis N/A Indefinite Back to A - Z Joint Hypermobility Syndrome Introduction Symptoms and signs Causes Diagnosis Differential Diagnosis Treatments Physiotherapy Support Organisations Further Evidence Care and Mobility Prognosis and duration Over 65s Introduction Hypermobile joints (JHM) are common, occurring in 10 -20% of Western populations and even more common in people of Indian, Chinese and Middle Eastern origin. If they are asymptomatic, these are simply people with hypermobility. It is important to distinguish them from patien ts with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS), where there are symptoms associated with the hypermobility and they meet the Brighton Criteria for diagnosis of this condition. The Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS) is a multi -system inherited connective tissu e disorder thought to be caused by faulty fibrous tissue matrix proteins such as collagen. It is indistinguishable from Ehlers -Danlos Syndrome - Hypermobility type (previously known as Ehlers -Danlos type III). Musculoskeletal problems include joint pain, r ecurrent sprains, dislocations, fractures, tendonitis, bursitis, premature osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and chronic pain syndrome. Symptoms also may include fatigue, autonomic disorders, proprioceptive (awareness of joint movement and position) problems, s kin abnormalities, uterine and rectal prolapse, herniae and gastrointestinal dysmotility. Symptoms and signs Tissue laxity results in increased flexibility, an asset to some dancers, gymnasts, musicians and athletes. However, fragile tissues are prone to overuse injury, rupture and healing is poor and often delayed. Muscle and joint complications - joint pain, sprains, tendonitis, bursitis, recurrent dislocations, fractures, early arthritis and osteoporosis, flat feet, chronic spinal disc problems with back and neck pain, chronic pain syndrome. Other complications - Smooth but stretchy, poor healing skin, papyraceous scarring, stretch marks, easy bruising, lax eyelids, bruising, uterine and rectal prolapse, stress incontinence, proprioceptive impai rment -intestinal problems: abdominal pain, constipation, gastroparesis, reflux - can require multiple medications and even naso -gastric tube or PEG feeding. Autonomic Disorders occur in 78 % of patients and include Vasodepressor Syncope and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS - increased pulse rate on standing or prolonged sitting can result in reduced blood supply to the brain and compensatory high adrenaline levels. Symptoms in clude fainting, dizziness, fatigue, poor concentration and memory problems, headaches, palpitations, tremor, sense of anxiety, nausea, sweats and visual problems. PoTS can produce functional impairment similar to that found in COPD and heart failure). Causes Joint Hypermobility Syndrome is probably an inherited (genetic) condition that is passed to an average of 50% of a patient's children (autosomal dominant). By chance, an affected parent may pass JHS to none, some or all of their children. A single gene defect has not yet been identified - several factors may be involved. Consequently, affected patients may become carers for affected relatives. Diagnosis Joint Hypermobility Syndrome is under -diagnosed. In one survey, over 50% of patients waited over 10 ye ars from onset of symptoms to receive a diagnosis. Diagnosis is clinical -there are currently no blood tests or other markers available. It is made on the basis of satisfying the BRIGHTON CRITERIA. Major Criteria A Beighton score of 4/9 or greater (current or historical) Arthralgia for longer than 3 months in more than 4 joints Minor Criteria A Beighton score of 1,2 or 3/9 (0 -3 if age 50+) Arthralgia >3 months in 1 -3 joints or back pain >3 months, spondylosis/spondylolisthesis Dislocation/subluxation in >1 joint, or 1 joint than tissue rheumatism(eg epicondylitis, hernia or uterine/rectal prolapse JHS diagnosed in presence of 2 major or 1major + 2 minor or 4 minor criteria (2 minor will suffice if there is an unequivocally affected 1st degree relative) BEIGHTON SCORE (maximum score 9) Opposition of the thumb to the volar aspect of the ipsilateral (same side) forearm (1 point for left; 1 for right) Passive dorsifl exion of the fifth mp joint to 90\u00b0 (1 point for left; 1 point for right) Hyperextension of the elbow to 10\u00b0 (1 point for left; 1 point for right) Placing of hands flat on the floor without bending knees (1 point) Hyperextension of the knee to 10\u00b0 (1 poi nt for left; 1 point for right) Differential Diagnosis It is important not to miss other conditions that manifest as hypermobile joints e.g. Marfans Syndrome (may be suggested by family history of early death from dissection or ruptured aortic aneurysm). Vasular types of Ehlers -Danlos Syndrome (can cause spontaneous rupture of artery, gut or uterus). Treatments People with JHS often respond poorly to analgesics and local anaesthetics. With frequent and persistent painful episodes and poor pain control, they often develop widespread chronic pain with pain amplification and kinesiophobia (avoidance of movement to avoid pain). Deconditioning develops. A multidisciplinary team approach can be helpful where available (e.g. rheumatologist, specialis t nurse, physiotherapy, podiatry, occupational therapy, pain management team). Depression is common due to chronic uncontrolled pain, difficulty with tasks of daily living, diagnostic delay and failure to recognise symptom severity. In general, surgery a nd steroid injections are not recommended for hypermobile joints Physiotherapy Overenthusiastic physiotherapy from practitioners inexperienced with JHS may exacerbate symptoms. Treatment should focus on: Core stabilising and proprioception Association Ehlers -Danlos Support UK Marfan Association UK Syncope Trust And problems / syncope) Postural Orthostatic Tachyca rdia Syndrome (POTS) Further Evidence Because of the wide range of clinical manifestations and spectrum of disability and needs it may often be necessary to obtain further evidence, in the form of a GP or physiotherapist report or a report by an examining medical practitioner. A rheumatologist's report may be particularly helpful. Care and Mobility People with severe forms of the JHS may be in frequent or constant pain that is worsened by movements, especially those involving physical effort such as lifting. Joints may dislocate following minimal movement. When the tissues are damaged, physically demanding activities are also painful and may give rise to care needs from another person. Periods of rest throughout the day may be required after onl y a modest amount of physical activity. Falls and/or faints may occur so that certain activities such as bathing, using stairs, etc may need to be supervised, particularly in elderly people with this syndrome. Main meal preparation, especially cutting up vegetables, opening jars, lifting pans and using taps may prove to be difficult. At times assistance may be required with toileting and personal hygiene. Workplace considerations: Chairs may need to be adapted to suit individual's need e.g. high back, lumbar support, elevated seat. It may be necessary to adapt taps and door -handles. Repetitive use of susceptible joints should be avoided. Special transport considerations may be necessary. Advice from an occupational therapist, physiotherapist or occupati onal health department may be helpful. Employees with autonomic complications may require a cool environment with the ability to take short regular breaks to eat and drink. Prolonged standing and sitting should be avoided. They may have special dietary requirements. Profound fatigue is a common problem and can impair stamina and concentration. Mobility considerations: Because the connective tissues are lax and fragile they may be easily injured or dislocate. The combination of unstable, painful joints and balance problems may make walking difficult. People with severe forms of the syndrome require the use of walking aids (cane, crutches) or wheelchair. Patients can become bed -bound. Prognosis and duration Pain can result from sudden injuries to the soft tissues which take weeks or months to heal. Long delays in diagnosis means that many patients (for example 24% of patient attending their first appointment at UCH Hypermobility Clinic) have established chronic pain syndrome and requiring a multi -disciplina ry team approach to management. Hypermobility/Hypermobility syndrome Over 65s People over 65 with this condition are likely to have accrued long term joint damage. They are likely to have more pain and symptoms than a younger person with this syndrome. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

August 2011 Back to A - Z Muscular Dystrophy Introduction There are several different types of muscular dystrophy, most of which are rare. All are progressive, hereditary disorders, in which muscle fibres degenerate and are replaced by fibrous tissue and fat, resulting in gradually increasing weakness. Only those muscular dystrophies most commonly encountered are described in detail. Their effects d epend on the muscles involved and on the rate of progress of the disease. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy This is the commonest and most severe form of muscular dystrophy. In about two -thirds of affected individuals, the condition is inherited through the mother, who is a carrier. In the remainder, the condition is a result of a change in genetic structure (mutation) in the egg (ovum). Only boys are affected by the disease - although a few female carriers show some of the symptoms, which rarely, is severe e nough to cause wheelchair - dependency. The condition usually becomes apparent between one and four years old, with delay in walking, a clumsy gait, inability to run properly, frequent falls and difficulty managing stairs. Learning difficulties and behaviou ral problems are relatively common, but usually mild to moderate. Weakness of the leg and hip muscles gradually increases, and walking becomes more difficult, despite the use of aids until a wheelchair is necessary. All boys become completely wheelchair -dependent by the age of 12 years. There is progressive weakness of the upper limbs and by mid - adolescence the only useful residual function is finger movement, which allows use of a keyboard and control of an electric wheelchair. Progressive spinal weaknes s leads to increasing curvature of the spine (scoliosis) which compromises breathing and causes difficulty with posture in the wheelchair. Spinal surgery (insertion of steel rods) may be necessary. Breathing difficulties increase due to progressive chest m uscle weakness and spinal curvature. Untreated, boys used to die in their late teens from ventilatory failure. The introduction of night -time, non -invasive ventilation over the last 20 years has led to marked prolongation of life (into the 30s) but with th e added complication of increasing physical disability and heart involvement. Heart muscle involvement (cardiomyopathy) is inevitable and requires drug treatment to prevent and treat heart failure. Although survival has been prolonged with the use of venti lation, those living longer are more likely to develop symptomatic cardiomyopathy, which may be fatal. There is more information about cardiomyopathy in the CCM guidance. Becker Type Muscular Dystrophy This is a variant of Duchenne dystrophy, again usuall y only affecting boys, although there are rare cases of symptomatic female carriers who may also develop cardiomyopathy. It is extremely variable in severity. At the mildest end of the spectrum, the only complaint may be of muscle pain on exercise or weakn ess may appear for the first time in middle age and progress only slowly. At the most severe end, it is essentially indistinguishable from Duchenne dystrophy - wheelchair dependency being a little later than in Duchenne i.e. in mid to late -teens. The most common form presents with weakness in childhood, affecting first the legs and later the arms. It progresses slowly and boys may remain ambulant (able to walk) with aids for many years. Wheelchair use becomes increasingly necessary from about the age of 40 years, but sometimes earlier. Heart muscle involvement (cardiomyopathy) is common and again variable in severity. In some, the cardiomyopathy is far more severe than limb involvement - rare cases require cardiac transplantation. More information on the ef fects and treatment of cardiomyopathy is provided in CCM guidance. Limb Girdle Dystrophy This broad term covers more than twenty specific genetic entities and affects both sexes. In terms of severity, the range is from a condition as severe as Duchenne dy strophy, to first presentation in late -middle age. Most commonly it presents in adolescence and early adult life. Muscle weakness is usually noticed in the lower limbs before the upper. Progression is relatively slow. Significant numbers eventually become wheelchair -dependent. Some are associated with cardiac involvement, which may be severe. Many are associated with ventilatory insufficiency, which may require the use of non -invasive ventilation. In some, ventilatory failure may occur when the patient is s till able to walk, but usually it develops when they have been wheelchair dependent for many years. Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy This is generally a milder disorder than those already mentioned, and affects both sexes. Onset may be at any age from child hood to adult life, but comes on most commonly during adolescence. The muscles of the face and shoulders are most affected, causing increasing difficulty in lifting the arms, weakness of eye closure and lack of facial expression. Despite the name, lower l imb involvement is common. Initially this is most commonly in the form of foot drop, but in the later stages of the disease there may be marked weakness around the hips causing major walking difficulties. It is commonly associated with spinal muscle weakne ss and abnormal curvature of the lumbar spine - low back pain is a common feature. About 10% of patients become wheelchair -dependent, and some of those will develop ventilatory insufficiency requiring non -invasive ventilation. Myotonic Dystrophy (dystroph ia myotonica) This condition is extremely variable in severity and differs from other forms of muscular dystrophy in being a multi -system disorder. The muscular problems may be accompanied by others involving the eyes, heart, lungs, hormone and immune syst ems and the brain. As well as weakness, there is difficulty in relaxing muscles after voluntary effort (myotonia). It affects both sexes and is commonly found in adults, developing between the ages of twenty and fifty, though it may occasionally arise in childhood or even at birth (in children of affected women) when it tends to be very severe and associated with major learning disabilities. The first symptoms in adults are usually weakness of the hands and difficulty with walking. The major non -muscle sym ptoms relate to brain function. Many have excessive daytime sleepiness very similar to narcolepsy. This may greatly interfere with employment and domestic activities. In those with adult onset, IQ tends to be lower than average, but in addition, specific c ognitive dysfunction is very common. This may be seen as \"apathy\", and look superficially like depression, but there are characteristic features of frontal lobe dysfunction (e.g. difficulties planning and completing simple tasks - dysexecutive problems) wh ich may significantly affect work performance as well as social functioning. Unlike other physical effects of the condition, cognitive function does not tend to worsen significantly during life. The distribution of muscle weakness is unusual, affecting th e extremities more severely than the shoulder and hip girdle muscles. Although the rate of progression of weakness is relatively slow, the specific involvement of the hands and ankles leads to profound functional disability, despite strong proximal muscles . In late stages, there may be wheelchair -dependency, but by then there will have been years of substantial disability due to distal weakness. Breathing muscles are affected early and causes hypoventilation which increases the risk of chest infection, the risk of which is also exacerbated by the involvement of the swallowing muscles which leads to aspiration of food and fluids. Pneumonia is the commonest cause of death. The heart conduction system is involved and may lead to blackouts requiring pacemaker in sertion. In addition, malignant cardiac arrhythmias are a relatively common cause of premature death. The effects and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias are covered in CCM guidance. Duration of Needs All these conditions are progressive, and cause gradually increasing disability. Needs, once established do not abate. The level of need will increase as the disease progresses. Myotonic Dystrophy (Dystrophia myotonica) Duchenne Muscular Muscular Dystrophy Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy Muscular dystrophy - Other / type not known All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on t he particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Updated - July 2016 Back to A - Z The Painful Neck Introduction Injury to the bones and soft tissue of the neck or \"degenerative\" disease of the bones and joints (spondylosis) are the frequent causes of neck pain. Pain in the neck can be acute (sudden) or chronic (longstanding). Common examples of the former are acute cervical disc prolapse and whiplash injury; the most common cause of chronic pain and stiffness in the neck is cervical spondylosis. This condition is due to degenerative changes in the neck vertebrae and the discs in between the vertebrae. Symptoms The symptoms and any limitation of neck movements due to an acute disc prolapse or strain injury genera lly last for no more than a few weeks. The pain is in the region of the neck, shoulder blades and may be felt in the shoulders and the arms. The pain may be accompanied by numbness and tingling or muscle weakness resulting in a poor grip and varying degree of muscle weakness of the upper limb muscles. Neck movements may also be stiff and limited. Very rarely a disc may press on the spinal cord leading to weakness and loss of sensation in upper and lower limbs, along with difficulty controlling the bladder a nd bowel. Cervical spondylosis is part of the ageing process. It is a form of osteoarthrosis. On X -ray there may be well developed bony and disc changes in cervical spondylosis which cause no significant pain or disability. Most people over the age of 50 years will show some changes due to cervical spondylosis on X-ray of the neck. The condition comes on gradually, in some cases it may be made worse by trauma. The symptoms are similar to those in acute lesions but are usually less severe. In some cases due to progressive compression of the nerve roots there may be muscle wasting and weakness of the upper limbs. Further Evidence Further evidence is most appropriate in these cases: a factual report from the hospital or GP or an examination by an examining me dical practitioner should be helpful. Care Considerations The help that is needed generally relates to tasks that involve the use of upper limbs i.e. dressing, washing hair and impairment of grip in using household utensils. The symptoms from cervical spo ndylosis can often subside spontaneously, or in response to treatment like a collar, analgesics or physiotherapy. In all but acute episodes of pain and stiffness due to a prolapsed disc or following severe neck strain, which rarely last longer than a few m onths, the pain and disability due to cervical spondylosis rarely gives rise to significant care needs. When there is evidence of muscle wasting or significant loss of sensation in the upper limbs and hands care needs as described above may be present. Mobility Considerations There may be difficulty in walking in cases of acute cervical disc prolapse when pressure on the spinal cord has produced leg muscle weakness. In people with cervical spondylosis it is unlikely that there will be any significant effec ts on the ability to walk unless there is evidence of irreversible damage to the spinal cord. In all such cases there will be a history of hospital admission, and in the acute cases, frequently of surgical intervention. In elderly people with advanced cerv ical spondylosis there may be pressure on the vertebro -basilar arteries providing blood to the brain. Certain movements of the neck can result in brief episodes of dizziness and/or unsteadiness. Rarely such episodes of vertebro -basilar insufficiency can re sult in brief altered consciousness or loss of consciousness. Duration of Needs In cases of acute disc prolapse the condition is likely to settle within a few weeks to months with treatment (including surgery). In cervical spondylosis, the established nee ds tend to be long -standing though they may be intermittent. Cervical disc lesion Cervical spondylosis Whiplash injury Neck disorder - Other / type not known All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. This text is an extract from the Disability Handbook. Extracts from the DHB are provided for a small number of topics where t here is no suitable CCM guidance or NHS choices page. Adapted from the DHB - August 2011. Back to A - Z Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS) Introduction Postural Tachycardia Syndrome is also called Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome or PoTS. It is an abnormal response by the autonomic nervous system to upright posture. When humans stand up, there should be minimal change in their blood pressure and heart rate. In PoTS, it is thought that blood vessels fail to narrow to maint ain blood pressure. Blood descends with gravity into the abdominal cavity and limbs. The heart races and, in some people, noradrenaline levels increase in an attempt to compensate. Symptoms result from reduced blood flow within the brain and increased bloo d levels of noradrenaline. Definition and Symptoms Definition: PoTS is defined as a sustained increase in heart rate of 30 or more beats per minute within 10 minutes of moving from a lying to standing position (40 beats per minute for those age 12 -19 years). Heart rate often increases to more than 120 beats per minute and blood pressure does not usually drop. There must also be symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (symptoms provoked by standing and relieved by lying down). Symptoms include: Cardiovascu lar - light-headedness, and of feet and hands. Gastrointestinal - nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bloating. General -Tiredness, weakness, headache, tremor s, sleep disturbances, difficulty exercising. Symptoms tend to be worse on standing or prolonged sitting and improve upon lying flat. They are worsened by heat, alcohol, exercise, large meals and lack of fluids. Disability has been shown to be similar to that found in chronic obstructive airways disease and heart failure. Causes Primary PoTS PoTS may be provoked by viral infection, pregnancy, immunisation and traumatic events. The 'developmental' form of PoTS is usually of gradual onset in teenagers. I n 'Hyperadrenergic' PoTS, patients may have very high noradrenaline levels and experience a sense of anxiety, tremor and cold sweaty hands and feet. Secondary PoTS PoTS is associated with the following illnesses: Joint Hypermobility Syndrome, Chronic Fatig ue Syndrome, Diabetes, SLE, Amyloidosis, Sarcoidosis, Cancer, Alcoholism and poisons such a lead and chemotherapy. Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually made by Tilt Table Test or Stand Test. There should be a sustained increase in heart rate of 30 beats per minu tes within the first 10 minutes of upright tilt or active standing. Blood pressure usually remains stable or increases slightly, although some patients will also experience a drop in blood pressure Differential Diagnosis As there is limited awareness of Po TS within the medical communities, it can be mistaken for other conditions including vaso -vagal syncope, chronic fatigue syndrome, anxiety, panic attacks or depression. Symptoms are similar to those found in pheochromocytoma (noradrenaline secreting tumour ) and hyperthyroidism and it may be necessary to exclude these conditions. Treatments Physiological: High fluid (and sometimes salt) intake, support tights, graded exercise programme. Medical: A number of drugs are used to treat symptoms; all are unlicensed for this use. They include CBT can help patients come to terms with their illness and disability. Although antid epressants (SSRIs and SNRIs) can be used in PoTS to improve heart rate and blood pressure control, they may also be necessary for co -existing depression. Support Organisations: PoTSUK: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia (Syncope Trust): Syncope Trust And Reflex anoxic Seizures (STARS) Further Evidence Because of the wide range of sympt oms and spectrum of disability and needs, it may often be necessary to obtain further evidence, in the form of a GP or hospital consultant report. Care and Mobility While some people with PoTS have minimal symptoms with little impact on their daily activit ies, others may become wheelchair users or bed -bound. Many patients can live independent lives, but some require constant supervision and assistance with many aspects of daily living. Symptoms can fluctuate significantly and people with PoTS can have good and bad days. Fluid intake should be at least 2 -3 litres per day. Frequent toilet breaks may be necessary. Food intake should preferably be in the form of small frequent meals, low in refined carbohydrates. Posture should be monitored. Prolonged standi ng should be avoided where possible. If patients experience problems with prolonged sitting, elevation of legs with a footstool can be helpful. Fatigue is a common symptom and short frequent breaks during activities may be helpful. At times, concentration and stamina may be reduced. Periods of rest throughout the day may be required after only a modest amount of physical activity. Mental clouding ('brain fog') can significantly impair concentration, especially when people with PoTS are upright ie standing or prolonged sitting. Recurrent fainting occurs in 40% of patients and injuries can occur. Certain activities such as bathing, using stairs, etc may need to be supervised. Family members may also have PoTS as some forms are inherited. Therefore affected people may also be carers for affected relatives. Workplace considerations Employees with PoTS may require a cool environment and a fan or air conditioning may be necessary. Prolonged standing and sitting should be avoided. They may have special dietary requirements. If fainting is a problem, work colleagues/ first aiders should be instructed in how to manage an unconscious person. Mobility considerations It may be necessary to adapt the home or workplace for use of a wheelchair. Prognosis and duration Many people will improve with time, especially those with the developmental and post -viral forms of PoTS. Those with the auto -immune or inherited types are likely to be affected for life. Although 25% of people with PoTS are unable to work or attend education, 80-90% will improve with treatment and 60% will return to previous levels of functioning.

Dr Lesley Kavi GP Birmingham July 2012 Back to A - Z Pain Management Clinic Not to be confused with Pain Clinics, which are usually run by anaesthetists and aim to treat the pain. Pain Management Clinics are run by a professional multi disciplinary team, usually consisting of a psychologist, physiotherapist, nurse and doctor. Pain management programmes are offered to people who have chronic pain of at least 6 months duration and where all other appropriate treatments have been undertaken . Referral from a GP or local hospital is required, and an initial assessment is carried out by the clinic to confirm suitability for the programme before a place will be offered. The programme lasts between 8 -10 weeks and consists of small groups who mee t weekly for a half - day session. Usually this is conducted on a non - residential basis, but in severe cases a residential option may be offered. A variety of methods are employed by the multi disciplinary team. The basis of the programme is aimed at in troducing coping strategies, which help individuals manage their pain and improve their quality of life. This will include psychological, physical and practical techniques, known as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Back to A - Z Skin Disease Introduction The skin is frequently affected by disease, whether as primary disease of the skin itself or as a secondary effect of other conditions. There are an enormous number of different skin diseases and their classification is complex but this is not important in this context as the effects of skin disease often follow similar patterns whatever the cause. The severity of skin conditions varies enormously. At one extreme, there may be nothing more than a small patch of redness on a finger resulting from sensitivity to a particular metal in a ring. At the other extreme, weeping blisters may cover an individual from head to foot, resulting in fluid loss to a degree, which may be life threatening. Some conditions resolve, never to return, when the cause is discovered and removed, as in the case of a specific allergy, whilst others follow a relapsing course throughout life requiring long -term treatment. Further Evidence If disability appears to be severe a factual report from the GP or hospital may help to assess the level of need. An examining medical practitioner report may also be useful in this respect. Care Considerations Even when skin disease is widespread and severe, in the absence of complications, an affe cted adult should to a very large extent, be able to cope with any necessary treatment unaided. Local treatment of the skin itself may require the application of lotions, creams, ointments, sprays, powders, or dressings. Only when the disease affects areas of skin which the individual cannot reach or when the hands are affected is there likely to be a need for attention. Even then, this may be brief and confined to mornings and evenings only. There is unlikely to be a need to treat the skin condition during the night hours. If skin disease is secondary to other conditions there may be additional problems that make treatment more difficult. There may also be secondary problems caused by the skin disease, or by general treatments, particularly when oral stero id preparations are used. Such additional problems may have an effect on the overall disability. Mobility Considerations Mobility needs may arise when the soles of the feet are badly affected, and in those rare instances where the lower limbs have to be e xtensively bandaged. In addition, some skin diseases, particularly psoriasis, may be associated with a widespread form of arthritis. Involvement of the joints of the lower limbs in such cases might well give rise to mobility needs. Duration of Needs By th e time adult life is reached the skin disease may be long -standing and all available avenues of treatment may well have been explored. However, it is unusual for skin disease to be so serious that an adult is severely disabled by it for any length of time. All information must be taken into account when considering the duration of disabling effects and the duration of disabling effects must be based on the particular circumstances of the individual claimant.

Back to A - Z Spinal Injury Introduction Damage to the spinal cord results in paralysis and loss of sensation below the level at which the cord has been injured; together with loss of ability to control bladder and bowels. The type of paralysis depends on the level of the injury. Paraplegia Paraplegia is para lysis involving both lower limbs, results from damage to the thoracic (middle) or lumbar (lower) sections of the cord. Part, or all of the 'trunk' may also be affected. Tetraplegia Tetraplegia, also called quadriplegia, is paralysis involving all four lim bs. It results from damage at the cervical (neck) level. The whole trunk may also be affected. Paraplegia is a major disability, but pioneering work at the Spinal Injuries Centre, Stoke Mandeville, during the 1939 -45 war showed that rehabilitation is poss ible in the great majority of cases to the point of independence, in a wheelchair and with suitably adapted living accommodation, in the activities of daily living. Paraplegia resulting from other causes The effects of paraplegia which is not of traumatic origin will depend on the cause. In conditions which, when successfully treated, do not lead to progressive disability, the care and mobility needs will be similar to those arising from traumatic paraplegia. Where paraplegia is due to progressive disease such as cancer, there will usually be progressive deterioration with accompanying high dependency on help from others. In persons with paraplegia not due to trauma, the cause of the condition will have to be identified, since this will give an indication of the likely care needs and their duration. If further evidence on this point is required, it should be sought from the GP or from a consultant at the hospital which the person is attending. Further Evidence In cases in which there is difficulty in decid ing the degree of a person's disability and what help is needed, a report from the spinal injuries unit with which the person has regular contact, would be helpful. Care Considerations Rehabilitation of the person with paraplegia depends on the person learning to transfer from bed to wheelchair or other surface at a similar level. The ability to do so requires normal function in the upper limbs. With the use of appropriate aids, the person can then swing the lower part of the trunk and lower limbs to effec t the transfer. The ability to balance whilst sitting, and to lean short distances forward, background, and sideways, may also be developed during the course of rehabilitation. Because of the loss of sensation the person is constantly exposed to a risk of damage to the skin and to the development of pressure sores. To avoid this danger they are taught to regularly change position both by day and by night. Loss of bladder and bowel control is dealt with in various ways. Mechanical pressure exerted by the person on the lower abdomen may be used to empty the bladder at pre -determined intervals. More commonly, intermittent self -catheterisation is employed. Alternatively, in men a penile sheath may be connected to a urinal strapped to the thigh if the blad der automatically empties when it is full. Emptying of the bowel may be assisted by use of suppositories or enemas, or by manual evacuation. A person with traumatic paraplegia who has normal function in the upper limbs would therefore usually be expected to attain a considerable degree of independence in attending to bodily functions. However, a significant amount of help may still be needed with tasks which are performed at the beginning and end of the day. As far as night is concerned, a person who, wit h suitable aids, can turn in bed should be able to do so at prescribed intervals by setting an alarm. If they cannot turn unaided, attention will be required. On occasion, a seemingly independent person does in fact require assistance. For example, repeated breakdown of the skin with the formation of pressure sores, or repeated urinary infection, may indicate that though the person appears to be coping with their own bodily functions, care is not adequate and help is required from another p erson. There are factors which may prevent successful rehabilitation. The majority of persons with traumatic paraplegia are young, previously healthy and possess the considerable and sustained motivation necessary for successful rehabilitation. Older pers ons may lack the requisite strength and stamina. Young people, who at the time of their accident suffer significant brain as well as spinal damage, may not be able to achieve independence. Some young people without brain damage may be unable to adjust psyc hologically to the radical change in their entire way of life, and in these circumstances continued assistance may be necessary. In people with tetraplegia, the upper limbs are also weak to a greater or lesser extent, and therefore cannot be used to effec t transfers from bed to wheelchair, to change position in bed, or to cope with bodily functions. People with tetraplegia will therefore require a great deal of help both by day and by night. Mobility Considerations The person with a spinal injury resultin g in paraplegia or tetraplegia is unable to walk but may be an independently mobile wheelchair user. Duration of Needs Rehabilitation in respect of care needs, during which the affected person has to 'master' all the new tasks which have to be learned, co mmonly takes about two years following the injury. During the rehabilitation phase, there is likely to be a need for considerable help, at least by day. At the end of this period a well -rehabilitated person with paraplegia should be able to perform most, o r all, of these tasks without the assistance of another person, although assistance may still be required with tasks at the beginning and end of the day. The care needs of a person with tetraplegia will be ongoing. A person with paraplegia or tetraplegia resulting from an injury which severs the spinal cord will remain permanently unable to walk.
