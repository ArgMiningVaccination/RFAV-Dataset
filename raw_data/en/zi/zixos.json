Let me explain why.", "sitename": "Medium", "date": "2023-08-19", "cleaned_text": "Natural Therapies do NOT Work It's not that I've come to this conclusion through a divine act or after a bottle of wine (divine, too!). I've spent more than half of my life dedicated to natural therapies. That's over 18 years, so I believe I'm qualified to give my opinion about natural or alternative therapies, and it is that they don't work. Where does this opinion come from? I have to say that it took me a lot of time and reflection to understand this. Many years of frustration when I felt that something was not right when I recommended supplements or therapies to clients who came to my consultation. Mind you, I'm not saying that plants aren't effective, because that would be denying reality. Often, they are as effective as pharmaceutical products, sometimes a little less effective, and in some cases, they are more effective than drugs. I'm also not saying that all natural therapies are scams, although some definitely are. In fact, there are natural therapies that are more effective than other techniques within the scope of modern medicine. So, you might be thinking: \"Luis, make up your mind. First, you say they don't work, and then you say they do.\" Hold on, let me explain. What I said at the beginning is that Natural Therapies do NOT work. And then I told you that there are therapies, supplements, and plants that are as effective as drugs or some medical techniques. So, let me clarify why Natural Therapies do NOT work. To put it simply, they don't work on their own for complete, real, and lasting healing. In most cases, natural therapies have ended up being used as an alternative or equivalent to modern medicine. That is, as remedies for symptoms and not for the real causes. Let me give you an example based on real experiences Two 50-year-old gentlemen, both entrepreneurs, are experiencing digestive discomfort. Both have heartburn, gas, abdominal bloating. One decides to see his trusted doctor. The other follows his wife's advice and goes to a naturopath. Both are recommended a treatment, each with its pros and cons. One is faster, and the other has fewer side effects. Both improve with their treatments, so they continue their lives as they were before, now with the reassurance that they have a remedy at hand to alleviate these... "}
