In addition to establishing accreditation criteria for the education of primary care chiropractic physicians, CCE ensures the quality of chiropractic education in the United States by stimulating educational excellence within its member programs and informing the educational community and the public of the nature, quality and integrity of chiropractic education. Certain requirements must be met before accreditation status can be initially received, or renewed. The CCE Standards for Chiropractic Programs and Institutions include criteria for assessment and planning in areas such as governance and administration, facilities, services and policies, instructional program objectives and content, faculty qualifications, admission requirements, outcomes assessment, clinical competency, and research. CCE is a member of the Council on Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and the Association of Specialized and Professional Accreditors (ASPA).

If you need direction, understanding, knowledge, a place to share ideas, you need to join ACA. ACA is constantly pushing the chiropractic profession forward. ACA taught me that there is a whole world of chiropractic outside of the classroom. My favorite thing about ACA is that it's a consistently developing organization seeking to enhance the chiropractic profession. ACA is the organization that is moving chiropractic forward and modernizing chiropractic. There are a lot of opportunities for leadership and professional development. It really helped me develop skills during my time as a student. The American Chiropractic Association (ACA), the largest professional chiropractic organization in the United States, represents the most principled and accomplished chiropractors, who understand that it takes more to be called an ACA chiropractor.
