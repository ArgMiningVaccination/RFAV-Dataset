These professionals often direct and manage projects and programs, consult with organizations and health departments, give public presentations, write articles and books on a variety of health topics, facilitate workshops and serve as faculty in higher education. Health educators may also specialize in working with specific populations, such as the youth or the elderly, or focus their work on specific chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, or obesity. Workplace Wellness A workplace wellness program is an employment-based activity or employer-sponsored benefit designed to promote health-related behaviors and disease management. These programs are becoming increasingly common, and frequently use health professionals to target and incentivize behavior shifts toward exercise, smoking cessation, stress reduction, and weight loss. Organizations are very interested in these shifts because they see the potential to increase employee production and morale and decrease healthcare costs. The workplace wellness area of concentration allows students to build core competencies around program needs assessment, development, and evaluation, and then focus specifically on the workplace setting for health promotion activities. These competencies and the foundational knowledge of integrative health practices provide MUIH graduates with a competitive advantage in a rapidly growing field.

DLETA projects the employment of health education specialists will grow 8-10% from 2021 to 2031, faster than the average for all occupations due to an emphasis on promoting healthy behaviors, particularly based on experiences from the COVID-19 pandemic. In its 2023 Best Jobs rankings, U.S. News and World Report ranks Health Educators as the fourth best education job.
