Purchasable with gift card $1USD or more about Music is a sacred thread that connects and unites us over time and space. It relinquishes lost memories of those with dementia, aids in the rebuilding our neural connections after injury or trauma, it can boost our immune system, impact our blood pressure and our stress perception. Comforts us Lites us up Holds space for all feelings, even those that are in expressible It is instrumental in our rituals both sacred and in play As a music therapist, I have encountered many humans who admit that life is difficult without the presence of music in their existence. This song is an ode to the wisdom of the elements of music, celebrating their transformational power on our mindbody & spirit. May it serve as an awakening of the directions we must to tend to in our collective and individual renewal. lyrics We call upon music We call upon medicine from the East Rhythm of our bodies, waking tempo of our feet Synchronicity of time and waves invite us here Where life emerges we dance through our old patterns of fear We call upon rhythm The medicine of rhythm The medicine of rhythm We call upon medicine from the South Melody from the truths we whisper and shout Guidance of the modulating pitch we learn to tune Where tension's resolution form the center of our heart's bloom We call upon melody The medicine of melody The medicine of melody We call upon medicine from the West Harmony of note to mode, relationships we've blessed Accompany cyclic shifts embracing dissonance Mindbody spirit merge in resolution's presence We call upon harmony The medicine of harmony The medicine of harmony We call upon medicine from the North Silence flows between the space of sounds and of words Retreating velocity with mindful rest to sow The quietude of urgency to fill the emptiness of growth We call upon Silence The medicine of silence The medicine of silence We call upon medicine from within Resonance from the sound authenticity emits Honoring frequencies of eternal self Spirit timbre through our skin and bones as we exhale We call upon resonance The medicine of resonance The medicine of resonance We call upon medicine from without Pattern articulate the composition of our sound Cyclical transmutations channel dharma into space Form and structure we inspire evolve the earth and the human race We call upon pattern The medicine of pattern The medicine of pattern We call upon Pattern from without Resonance from within Silence from the north Harmony from the west We call upon Melody from the south Rhythm from the east We call upon music all around Music all around We call upon music Music Music credits released October 31, 2022 Ft.
