The author's overall prescribing techniques, underlying logic and other observations are given according to individual patient profile and practitioner choice. THE SYSTEM Our Endocrine System is summarised by the Gale Encyclopaedia of Medicine as \"a system of organs that produces chemicals that go into the bloodstream to reach other organs whose functioning they affect\". This, essentially, is our body's chemical messenger service. Hormones, which are these chemicals that circulate in the bloodstream are continuously secreted, but the endocrine glands have a natural tendency to over-secrete and so control of our endocrine secretions is via negative feedback. It is not dependent upon the amount of hormone present, but upon whether or not its intended function is being achieved. One gland produces a hormone which affects a second gland. That gland then produces its own hormone, which in turn influences the first gland's secretion and so hormones have an increasing effect upon their target cells and organs. When over-function occurs, the feedback system (usually routed via the Hypothalamus in the brain) causes the endocrine organ in question to halt its production. In under-function, where the target cells or organ are not responding to their hormonal messenger, the body produces an increasing amount of that hormone to compensate for the problem. Thus, our Endocrine System is an extremely interdependent and intricate set-up: a dysfunction in one gland will certainly result in a disruption elsewhere in the body. Allopathic tests for glandular function usually only address the quantities of hormone levels present in the bloodstream and these occur in minute amounts: 1 picogram per pint of blood. A picogram is a millionth of a millionth of a gram, and so medical and synthetically produced hormonal treatments tend to be rather unsubtle, to say the least: our bodies just don't react in the same way to what amounts to chemical sledgehammers as they do to natural prompts! Also of course, ordinary medicine may not necessarily consider either the reason behind any endocrine dysfunction, or its actual location/s. THE GLANDULAR HIERARCHY HYPOTHALAMUS The endocrine synergy of regulation and production works within a type of hierarchy driven by the Hypothalamus. The Hypothalamus is often described as the body's internal eyeball, and I find it helpful to liken its role to that of a Chief Executive of an organisation. The Hypothalamus itself comprises a collection of cells at the base of the forebrain that acts as the receiver of messages via nerve cells from other parts of the brain. It then sends out signals to the Pituitary Gland by substances termed neuro-hormones to stimulate or inhibit glandular secretions somewhere else in the system in response to received information in order to co-ordinate, maintain and control our internal homeostasis. It can be seen that the endocrine and nervous systems are also closely intertwined: something else that conventional medical concepts tend to de-emphasise. What actually happens is that the endocrine hormones act directly upon our glands and body tissues whilst the autonomic nerves activate the relevant motor nerves of our sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in order to make changes in breathing, heart rate, galvanic skin response and so on, to activate reflex actions (such as blinking) and to carry out bodily processes such as digestion. This nervous and endocrine mutuality is one reason why stress and our coping mechanisms play such a significant role in a variety of dis-ease. Agrawal (2004) directly links emotions and parts of the body to the endocrine glands, based upon the inter-relationship between the seven chakras, the endocrine glands and our emotionality that traditional Hindu thinking holds, whilst Ambika Wauters (1999) inter alia, has further aligned our chakras to colours as well as emotions, illustrated in the summary table below. Hypothalamus Homeopathics Squire (2003) lists the BCG vaccine nosode, along with Pulsatilla and Tuberculinum as related remedies to the Hypothalamus sarcode, and Hilery Dorrian notes that the Hypothalamus remedy picture can present similarly to that of Puls with the tearfulness, changeability and so on. So we could think of this sarcode in cases where extreme levels of emotional and physical stress have caused a general hormonal imbalance. I have used Rainbow (or Spectrum) quite successfully as a support where I have sensed that a patients' chakras have been thrown out of alignment and they have reported that the remedy acted as a wonderful pick-me-up. Aside from this, I would say that it is the constitutional remedy of the individual concerned that is the most closely aligned to the Hypothalamus, simply because it is their own 'boss'. PITUITARY GLAND The Pituitary Gland, located in the base of the brain has two lobes, the Anterior and Posterior. The Anterior lobe is an actual gland in itself, whilst the Posterior lobe consists of a lump of nervous tissue directly connected to the Hypothalamus. The Anterior lobe can be said to be the more important influence upon the functioning of other glands, as it produces six hormones to the Posterior's two, but essentially the lobes act in concert and are able to compensate for each other. Anterior Lobe Hormones The Anterior Lobe produces prolactin, which is a hormone involved in the preparation of the breasts for maternal milk production and to synthesise this following birth. It also produces somatotropin, the human growth hormone that primarily influences the skeletal system, growth rate and maturational size. Under-secretion of this hormone results in dwarfism, whilst over-secretion results in gigantism in children and a condition known as acromegaly in adults (as in the James Bond film character 'Jaws'). Metabolic effects of somatotropin include the general synthesis of amino acids, assimilation of fat and blood sugar levels. The Anterior lobe of the pituitary gland also produces a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which influences all aspects of thyroid function and ultimately the regulation of our metabolic rate, fat breakdown and the water content of certain tissues. The follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is also created here. FSH controls the maturation of ovarian follicles in females and sperm production in males. Luteinizing hormone (LH) also comes from the anterior lobe of the pituitary. LH contributes to the formation of the corpus luteum and therefore production and synthesis of the egg in women, as well as preparing the breast for lactation. The equivalent hormone to LH in men produced by the anterior pituitary is the ICSH, or interstitial cell stimulation hormone, which acts on the testes and affects sperm and testosterone (the major male hormone) production. ACTH or adrenocorticotrophine, a hormone affecting various secretions of the Adrenal Gland, also starts life in this lobe. The general metabolic effects of ACTH include the mobilisation of fats, blood sugar and glycogen (muscle fuel) levels as well our body's resistance to stress. Posterior Lobe Hormones The Posterior lobe of the pituitary gland secretes an anti-diuretic hormone called ADH that, to a certain extent, is responsible for the constriction of veins in some cases of high blood pressure, but more importantly affects kidney function. Water is re-absorbed by the kidneys so that less urine is excreted. ADH under-secretion causes the condition diabetes insipidus, where excessive amounts of very dilute urine are excreted but not absorbed. The other hormone secreted by the Posterior Pituitary is oxytocin, which works alongside prolactin in the production and flow of milk and also acts on the smooth muscles of the uterus in pregnancy. Both of these two hormones are actually produced in the Hypothalamus and are only stored and released by the Posterior lobe. Overall then, the Pituitary Gland extensively affects our wellbeing and lifespan development in general, including our early in utero period. It can therefore be said to act rather like our body's Managing Director, and is generally known as the master gland of the body because of its action upon the activity of the thyroid and adrenal glands and upon our organs of reproduction: the ovaries and testes, or gonads. Pituitary Homeopathics The functions of both lobes of the Pituitary gland, and hence the whole gland are fairly well defined and so choice of the three related sarcodes would mirror whatever was being addressed. As far as my own practice is concerned, Pit Ant has been indicated the most, predominantly in children when maturational markers or behavioural issues have been delayed and has been especially useful as an intercurrent in cases of bedwetting. Baryta-Carb is also very helpful in contexts of delayed development and with childlike presentations in the elderly. Because of its hormonal profile, [Folliculinum](https://hpathy.com/materia-medica/folliculinum-mist-or-miasm/) has an affinity with this gland. THYROID GLAND The Thyroid Gland, located in the front and sides of the base of the neck just below the larynx, acts rather like our body's General Manager. It is a butterfly-shaped gland containing a number of closed follicles and, essentially, it controls the pace of chemical activity and metabolism of every cell of the body. Thus it impacts significantly upon the growth and rate of function of many other bodily systems. Thyroid Hormones Thyroid cells produce two hormones, thyroxin or T4 and T3 (tri-iodothyronine). Their formation is dependent upon the amino acid Tyrosine (hence the T) and also upon the mineral iodine. These hormones both determine how quickly the body burns energy, makes proteins, and how sensitive the body should be to other hormones, and along with the growth hormone somatotropin, ensure our brain development, urine production, protein breakdown and glucose uptake. Untreated hypothyroidism (or under-secretion) in children results in the unkindly-named condition of cretinism. In adults it causes myxoedema (non-pitting facial oedema, or swelling). Both conditions also feature a low overall metabolic rate and excess body weight. Untreated hyperthyroidism (over-secretion) increases the metabolic rate generally, and sometimes causes exophthalmos, or protruding eyeballs. Goitre on the other hand is the name for any enlargement of the thyroid gland itself and can be present with or without hyperthyroidism. It is also possible for this two-lobed, follicular gland to be partially under- and partially over- active at the same time and symptoms of both polarities may overlap, for example fatigue, thinning hair, poor libido. Thyroid Homeopathics Thyroid therapeutics are perhaps the most well-documented, used and needed raft of remedies in general practice, but rather than reinvent the wheel, some differentiation of available remedies may be useful here. Thyroidinum, first introduced by Clarke, and useful in both hyper- and hypo-thyroid conditions, is the prepared extract of the thyroid gland of a sheep or calf whereas Thyroiodinum (otherwise known as Iodothyrine) is the pure iodine derived from this source (Murphy 2000). Thyroxine is the allopathic drug also derived from animal glands and is most useful as a tautopathic remedy to support withdrawal. For a human source, Thyroid Gland would be the option. As a plant based support, the most useful remedy is perhaps Fucus Vesiculosus, or Sea Kelp and can be used effectively as a supplement as well as homeopathically to support the Thyroid gland. It is the primary source of natural iodine, or Iodium, a major hyper-active thyroid remedy. Other useful thyroid supports are Kali Iodatum, or Potassium Iodide which is non-radioactive iodine used to prevent the thyroid gland absorbing radiation in nuclear incidents, and Calcarea Iodata (Iodide of Lime), useful homeopathically for thyroid dysfunction associated with hormonal changes. PARATHYROID GLANDS Just behind the thyroid are the pea-sized glands of the Parathyroid (usually four, two behind each lobe) that assist calcitonin from the thyroid in metabolising, assimilating and regulating calcium in order that the nervous and muscular systems can function efficiently. Parathyroid Hormone The glands produce parathormone to perform this function. Over-production causes calcium to be moved from the bones into the blood and then excreted in urine, which then can result in brittle bones and kidney stones. Under-secretion causes low calcium levels in the blood, resulting in muscular rigidity and/or spasm (tetany). The latter can sometimes be in evidence following thyroid surgery where the parathyroids have inadvertently been removed (according to Watson 2000) and then calcium is then traditionally prescribed to correct the mistake, something which really inspires confidence in hospital treatment. Parathyroid Homeopathics The Parathyroid sarcode is helpful in cases of osteoprosis (which is the de-mineralisation and loss of density of bones), bony spurs and also kidney stones. These conditions are caused through non-absorption of calcium and the remedy Calcarea Renalis is potentised kidney stone. The syphilitic connection here is also evident. ADRENAL GLANDS Near to and just above the kidneys are the Adrenal (or suprarenal) Glands. Each gland has two distinct zones: the outer cortex and the inner medulla. Adrenal Cortex Hormones The mineralocorticoid steroid Aldosterone is produced here. It regulates the relative concentrations of minerals in the body fluids and water content of tissues, in particular our sodium: potassium balance. A deficiency of Aldosterone causes increased secretions of sodium and chloride ions so that too much water is lost from the body in urine. Correspondingly, concentrations of sodium, chloride and bicarbonate in the blood decrease and acidosis (increased acidity and low alkaline content of blood plasma) result. The central part of the adrenals produces a group of glucocorticoid hormones responsible for efficient carbohydrate metabolism. The most important of these is Cortisol (otherwise known as Hydrocortisone), released in response to ACTH from the Anterior Pituitary and working in conjunction with adrenaline (epinephrine) from the Adrenal Medulla. It releases carbohydrate and protein stores for use as energy and controls our immune responses, including fever and inflammations, and inhibits cell division to promote healing. Cortisone and corticosterone are the other primary glucocorticoids, mostly involved in preventing allergic reactions and tissue repair, and all three are greatly affected by chronic stress, which increases glucocorticoid production. If this is prolonged, the likelihood of ulcer formation is increased, blood pressure rises and our body's resistance to stress is lowered via resultant atrophy of lymphatic tissue. Many people 'break out in a rash' when stressed, other have an 'upset stomach'. Under-secretion of the glucocorticoid and corticoid hormones results in Addison's disease, where symptoms of anaemia, anorexia, muscle weakness, low blood pressure and sugar levels, bronzing of the skin and mucous membranes occur. Overproduction of glucocorticoid hormones causes the condition known as Cushing's syndrome, which includes symptoms such as weight gain and oedema on the trunk and face, easy bruising and poor healing, raised blood pressure and pH, osteoporosis etc. Relatively small amounts of oestrogens and androgens (known as gonadocorticoids from this source) are also produced by the adrenal cortex, although primary production of these hormones occurs the gonads (ovaries and testes). Some progesterone is also manufactured by this chemical transformation process. Adrenal androgens and oestrogens affect the development and functioning of the reproductive organs as well as certain physical and (possibly) temperamental characteristics. Their effects are more apparent in incidences of hyper-secretion, for example an adrenal tumour in a woman may produce deepening of the voice and facial hair growth, which are usually secondary male characteristics. Further, this secondary source of oestrogen is especially important for post-menopausal women when ovarian production of oestrogens tails off. Further, Melissa Assilem (1996) maintains that the contraceptive pill is responsible for depleting the adrenal cortex because of its interference with the normal production of progesterone by the ovaries, causing them to 'borrow' from corticosteroidal sources in the adrenals in order for the menstrual cycle to remain unbroken. Also, this secondary supply of masculinising hormones may be implicated in the over-production of testosterone in some women with polycystic ovary syndrome, where stress and male pattern hair growth are present. Adrenal Medulla Hormones The medulla of the adrenal glands produces the two hormones Adrenaline and Noradrenaline (also known as Epinephrine and Norepinephrine respectively) that comprise our body's 'fight or flight' mechanism in response to stress, initiated by the sympathetic nervous system. Adrenaline is 80% of the total hormone production and Noradrenaline 20%. Together they increase the strength and rate of the heart beat, cause the arteries supplying the heart and skeletal muscles to dilate whilst constricting those of other arteries, increase respiration, raise blood sugar levels by converting glycogen (stored sugar) in the liver to glucose (available sugar) in the blood and finally stimulate the general metabolic cellular activity. No mean feat! We can begin to get some idea of the extent of the negative and all-pervasive effects of chronic stress, which is more accurately perhaps, adrenal 'burn-out' when considering these vital and integral functions of our Adrenal Glands. Adrenal Homeopathics Obviously, adrenal sarcodes would be appropriate for patients diagnosed with Addison's Disease and Cushing's Syndrome. The remedy Adrenalin is described in Murphy as Adrenal Gland and I have prescribed it successfully for ME. It would also have a place in CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and Hilery Dorrian recommends it for children diagnosed with ADHD, as the condition could be in part due to inefficient neurotransmission. Since it is a great calmer-down, it is also recommended in combination with Aconitum and Argentum Nitricum as a remedy to help with panic attacks (I have prescribed it for fear of flying), and with Apis Mellifica and Histamine for severe allergic reactions. Adrenalin has been described as a modern Sepia. Cortisone is such a useful remedy in skin conditions, particularly where there has been any suppression with steroids that needs gentle unblocking in order to get at the underlying miasm. I frequently prescribe it with Carcinosin followed by Tuberculinum, based on Hilery Dorrian's and Gordon Sambidge's regimes for the management of eczema (see HIP article Autumn 2006). I have used a support remedy combination with good results of Borago Officinalis/ Eleutherococcus Senticosus/ a 3X potency, along with their constitutional or totality remedy for a patient whose adrenal function seemed to be depleted, based on college notes on herbal support remedies. THE GONADS (OVARIES & TESTES) The Ovaries and the Testes produce oestrogen and testosterone, which control female and male sexual development and fertility, and progesterone which is another major player in the menstrual cycle and in pregnancy. The synthesis and secretion of oestrogens is stimulated by FSH, which in turn, is controlled by the neurohormone GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone) from the Hypothalamus. Production of testosterone and of progesterone is controlled by the release of LH prompted by the release of GnRH, see figure 2. Fig 2: Sex Hormones and the Brain source: Oestrogen Oestrogens are a group of steroid hormone compounds, functioning as the primary female sex hormone, although oestrogen is also present in smaller quantities in men. The three major naturally occurring oestrogens in women are oestrone (E1), oestradiol (E2), and oestriol E2 predominates in non-pregnant women of reproductive age, E1 is produced during menopause, and E3 is the primary oestrogen of pregnancy. E2 is produced from testosterone and levels vary through the menstrual cycle, with levels highest just before ovulation. Apart from the adrenal oestrogens, primary sources are the developing follicles in the ovaries, the corpus luteum and the placenta. They promote the development of female secondary sex characteristics, are also involved in the thickening of the endometrium and other aspects of regulating the menstrual cycle. In males, oestrogen regulates certain functions of the reproductive system important to the maturation of sperm and may also be necessary for a healthy libido. Oestrogens also have non-reproductive effects. They antagonize the effects of the parathyroid hormone, minimizing the loss of calcium from bones (hence the emphasis placed upon the likelihood of osteoporosis in our later years) and oestrogen is known to have an inhibitory effect on the thyroid itself. The hormone also promotes blood clotting. Many types of breast cancers, once established, rely on supplies of oestrogen to grow and suppression of oestrogen production is a conventional treatment for these cancers. As an aside, a range of synthetic and natural substances have been identified that also possess oestrogenic activity. Synthetic substances of this kind are known as xeno-oestrogens and are frequently chemicals derived from pesticides or plastics (!) which mimic or disrupt the action of oestrogens. They are fat-soluble and so, worryingly, can store themselves in the adipose tissues of the body, including animal fat. It has also been established that hormone disruptors not only affect male and female fertility but also deplete our immune system, so here's another reason for meat eaters to stick to lean and organic! Testosterone Testosterone is the principal male sex hormone from the androgen group, primarily secreted in the testes of males and the ovaries of females. It is an essential hormone for the production of sperm and levels decline gradually with age. It is an anabolic steroid, i.e. affecting muscle mass and strength, growth, bone density and maturation. Like other steroid hormones, testosterone is derived from cholesterol. It is also synthesized in far smaller quantities in women by the ovaries, by the placenta and by the adrenal cortex in both sexes. In men, testosterone also plays a key role in health and well-being and in osteoporosis. On average, an adult human male body produces about forty to sixty times more testosterone than an adult female body. However, overall production ranges for male and female are very wide, such that the respective ranges can overlap at the low end and high end respectively. Testosterone has an interesting effect on insulin, produced by the Pancreas: too little in men will inhibit the action of insulin, whereas in women too much is inhibitory. Progesterone Progesterone is produced in the ovaries (specifically after ovulation in the corpus luteum), as well as in the brain and in increasing amounts in the placenta during pregnancy. Initially after conception, the main source of progesterone is the corpus luteum but after the 8th week of pregnancy, production shifts to the placenta. Progesterone is sometimes called the \"hormone of pregnancy\", as it fulfills so many functions relating to the development of the foetus. Progesterone also prepares the endometrium, the vaginal epithelium, cervical mucus and the uterus for implantation. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels decrease, leading to menstruation. Normal menstrual bleeding is thus progesterone withdrawal bleeding. During foetal implantation and gestation, progesterone decreases the maternal immune response to allow for the acceptance of the pregnancy and strengthens the uterine smooth muscle. Additionally, progesterone inhibits lactation and the fall in levels following birth forms one of the triggers for maternal milk production. The initial drop in progesterone levels is possibly one step that facilitates the onset of labour, whilst the foetus metabolises placental progesterone in the production of its adrenal steroids. Progesterone and cortisol share the same building block, hence chronic stress can lower progesterone levels as the body steals it to make cortisol. This can result in oestrogen dominance as the extra adrenaline and cortisol enhance the effects of oestrogen at the expense of progesterone. Ovarian and Testicular Homeopathics I have found that the most frequently required hormonal remedy in my practice is Folliculinum in varying potencies. This has been either because it has been called for in a regulatory capacity, in which case I normally use a 7C, or because it fitted the patient's overall presenting picture so aptly. It is a well documented and proved remedy, made from the ovarian follicle, or the cavity where the egg is formed prior to its release at ovulation. Oopherinum is the sarcode obtained by the trituration of the juice of sheep or cow ovary and it was helpful for a patient who'd had a partial ovarectomy with menopausal symptoms. Almost all other 'female' remedies related to the menstrual cycle, birth and pregnancy focus on the uterus, rather than the ovaries themselves, although Ustilago Maydis (or Corn Smut) is associated with ovarian pain, and particularly the left side. It is also worth mentioning that Ustilago is a myco-oestrogen, i.e. a fungus having some oestrogenic activity, as is Secale Cornutum (which is Secale, the ergot found on rye). As a remedy it mainly affects the uterus and is one of the remedies often prescribed for dysmennorhea. However, for menstrual problems, (which of course involve the uterus!) I almost always give the herbal tincture Agnus Castus as well as Folliculinum because as an effective uterine tonic it invariably helps the entire reproductive system. Testosterone in 6C and 7C has been a useful support remedy for both male and female acne, as the condition so often involves hormonal imbalance or over-production. It is also worth considering as a helper for polycystic ovaries where women may have acne as a side effect, as well as excess facial hair and easy weight gain. For men specifically, Orchitinum is the sarcode prepared from the testes extract, and is useful for sexual weakness, debility and premature senile decay (Murphy 2000). A better known and (more popular!) plant-based support, especially in prostate problems is Sabal Serrulata, better known as Saw Palmetto and can be either given as a herbal tincture or homeopathically. Conium Maculatum is also another helpful remedy for specifically 'male' glandular contexts. In pregnancy, I invariably prescribe a patient's constitutional remedy, rather than Progesterone, along with any other remedies that may be required for acute complaints or to enhance a tissue salt pregnancy programme, if required. It could be considered as a useful support however. PANCREAS The Pancreas monitors the level of glucose in the portal vein and produces its hormones accordingly to either store glucose in the liver or to release it for energy. The gland is located near the liver and behind the stomach and its endocrine function is to produce insulin to encourage glucose uptake by the cells, along with glucogon to prompt tissues to release glucose back into the bloodstream in order to regulate and maintain the body's requirements. These hormones are produced in area of the Pancreas known as the 'islets of Langerhans'. The other function of the Pancreas is of course digestive: it produces some of our digestive enzymes and releases these into the small intestine, whereas the hormones pass directly into the bloodstream. Pancreatic Hormones Glucagon is produced by 25% of the islets of Langerhans and secreted in response to a fall in blood sugar levels, stimulating glucose production in order to raise them. Insulin is secreted by the remaining 75% of the pancreatic islets in response to a rise in blood sugar levels, as in after a meal. It then lowers the levels by converting glucose to a safe form (glycogen) for storage by the liver and also by increasing cellular absorption. Blood sugar levels therefore are maintained by a balance between these two hormones as they both affect overall carbohydrate metabolism, with the liver acting as a buffer. Metabolism of fats and proteins are closely related to that of carbohydrates, and here again we have a situation where a disturbance in one system will affect the others. Constant blood glucose concentration is important because glucose is the only nutrient that can be normally utilised by the brain, retina and the lining of the gonads in sufficient quantities to supply them with required energy. If there is a dysfunction and insufficient insulin production, then Type 1 diabetes, or diabetes mellitus results. A sufferer is dependent upon insulin because the pancreas has become unable to produce sufficient hormones to keep glucose levels in the bloodstream down, major cell damage results (the pancreas packs up) and glucose is excreted in urine. There is no more glucose stored in the liver because it couldn't be converted and acidosis, coma and death can result without regular supplies of insulin. The body will also 'borrow' adrenalin in order to compensate for this lack of glycogen production. Type 2, or late onset diabetes, is usually non-insulin dependent, as the body has become insulin resistant rather than dysfunctional, as in Type 1. Type 2 diabetes is often related to bad dietary habits, such as over-consumption of over-refined fats and sugars, and high stress levels. This involves both the pancreas and the adrenals because of the roles of the hormones insulin, glycogen and adrenalin in this imbalance, but with careful attention to diet, exercise, stress and anger management, as well as appropriate treatment, both conditions can be effectively managed. Homeopathy for the Pancreas I believe it is difficult to separate the liver from the pancreas (and indeed the gall bladder), especially in a homeopathic context because whatever will benefit the liver will assist the pancreas and also the gall bladder. The web becomes even more tangled as the Thyroid gland, in its general manager capacity, is also implicated because of its significant hormonal say in glucose metabolism, so support remedies perhaps would be needed further up the endocrine hierarchy as well. However, Pancreatinum is listed in Murphy (2000), which is a sarcode extracted from the pancreatic glands of ox or sheep, and as such is a combination of several digestive enzymes. This may be helpful if it has been established that it is the pancreas specifically that is at fault, along with hypoglycaemic support remedies such as Insulin in low potencies, particularly if there are accompanying diabetes-related skin problems such as abscesses, boils, leg ulcers etc. Syzygium Jambolanum (Jambol Seed) in herbal tincture/low potency is another reputed hypoglaemic, and the remedy Iris Versiclor is noted for its action on the pancreas. Needless to say, such treatment would be accompanied by miasmatic and/or constitutional remedies, along with self-management measures mentioned above to avoid stress and weight gain. THYMUS The Thymus is a two-lobed, pinkish grey gland located behind the sternum, slightly above the heart and under the thyroid. It was only as recently as the 1960s when it was established that the Thymus Gland plays a significant role in both creating and maintaining our immune system. Without it we become vulnerable to the least infection, as it acts as the thermostat for our immunity levels. The gland itself grows steadily from birth to puberty as our immune system matures, after which it shrinks somewhat, but not to the extent that most medical textbooks maintain. This would explain its less active, but no less important function in adults and why so many are affected adversely by childhood vaccination regimes as well as by travel and 'flu jabs in adulthood. Colin Griffiths (2007) maintains that it is unsurprising that early post mortems found the thymus gland of dead adults to be largely atrophied, which fuelled traditional medical assumptions that the gland became useless after puberty when the immune system matures. The incidences of disease and malnutrition prevalent at the time were sufficient to hinder and reduce thymus size and function to a level that was inadequate for survival. Modern day threats to the thymus are factors such as smoking, prescription and recreational drugs, pesticides, over-processed food and artificial additives and the ubiquitous stress. Thymus Gland Secretions The Thymus produces thymosin and thymopoietin which are vital for the creation, maturation and maintenance of our immunity and auto-immunity, and they affect lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte (helper) cells. It has become increasingly recognised that T-lymphocytes are the most important part of the immune system as they have a threefold function in that context: stimulating further production of antibodies by other lymphocytes; regulating phagocyte cell activity (phagocytes engulf bacteria and viruses) and the recognition and destruction of foreign and abnormal tissue. Thymopoietin specifically regulates neuromuscular signals so that the body can avoid being in a state of permanent over-stimulation, as in the condition myasthenia gravis, an auto-immune condition where the majority of sufferers have a thyroid gland dysfunction. Thymus Homeopathics Colin Griffith (2007) highlights its use for boosting general immunity, particularly in children and as an invaluable remedy for vaccination damage at any age, particularly when given in conjunction with tautopathic vaccine remedies. He also recommends its use for preparing the body, mind and spirit to address past trauma of any kind, especially when it has drastically changed the life pattern of the individual concerned. Here again, it works well with other indicated remedies. Agrawal (2004) recommends the sarcode as a corrective for any state where there is not only general oversensitivity to physical stimuli but also to mental ones. PINEAL GLAND The only (conventionally) un-paired gland in the body is the Pineal Gland, sometimes known as the 'third eye'. The ancients paired the pineal and pituitary glands as twin sentries at the threshold of the acquisition of spiritual consciousness in the material world. The gland itself is about the size of a cherry stone, located in the middle of the brain. In modern medical circles it is often used as a landmark in X-rays of the skull as it is known to be prone to calcification in later life (Watson 2000) and held to be more active at puberty, although its precise role and influence throughout our lifespan still remains (conventionally again) unclear. Pineal Secretions The Pineal produces melatonin and serotonin (a neuro-transmitter essential for our 'feel-good factor') which both regulate sleep cycles and our body clock, or Circadian rhythms. The secretions also work in conjunction with the Hypothalamus in controlling thirst, hunger, sex drive and the ageing process. The gland relies on light for awareness of both time of day and season, as winter and summer are registered according to changes in length of daylight. Melatonin production is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light and many people who are totally sightless still have some neurological response to light as it registers with the pineal gland. Melatonin acts as the body's off-switch. Production is activated by dusk and this is the cue for the parasympathetic nervous system to repair and regenerate. It does so by suppressing the adrenal hormones at night and stimulating production of thymus hormones to assist the immune system, as well as acting as an anti-oxidant to deal with potentially toxic free radicals. This illustrates why the sleep cycles and quality of sleep of shiftworkers can be so often compromised and why it is so important to us that we get a good night's sleep in order to re-charge our figurative batteries. We can also see how 'jet lag' comes about. Pineal Homeopathics Agrawal (2004) maintains that the Pineal Gland and the Thymus work together in healthy states but conflict in illness, recommending Pineal Gland in instances of general glandular under-activity and Thymus for general hyperactivity. It is also held that the recreational drug cannabis will disturb the delicate balance between the two glands and that the meditatively proven remedy Banisteriopsis Caapi (Ayahuasca) has a big affiliation to these two glands, because of its shamanic, hallucinatory usage in South America, where the vine originates. I have prescribed Pineal Gland in cases of persistent sleep difficulties and in cases of SAD with good results. A table summarising each gland's functions and hormones responsible is provided. PRESCRIBING RELATED HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES GENERAL TECHNIQUES My usual first choice in the homeopathic treatment of patients with direct glandular-related conditions is to give the relevant sarcode of any endocrine component that is compromised, often on an intercurrent basis and in a 30C. This extends to prescribing the relevant gland in potency if it has been surgically removed, as its energy will still be present and in need of attention, frequently as a root or maintaining cause. Any organ therapeutic support remedies I usually give in combinations in low potencies two or three daily, to work quietly away in the background whilst a deeper acting totality, fundamental or constitutional remedy addresses the patient's more holistic presentation. Otherwise relevant herbal or mother tinctures or essences are a further therapeutic option. Many herbs act similarly whether they are taken homeopathically in low potency (i.e. 1X or 3X) or used in their tincture state. Sometimes I have included colour remedies in support remedy combinations, based upon what I've perceived to be compromised or related chakras, or when a patient has described an emotion or symptom in such terms. However, I acknowledge that this has been rather an intuitive choice according to (my perception of) the patient's psyche. On a general glandular basis, I have also used Acer Pseudoplatanus (better known as Sycamore Seed) because of its affinity for paired organs as a support remedy, especially in the cases of twins and therefore consider it affiliated to the Hypothalamus. I have also considered remedies from the Calcarea, Iodiums and Kali families for general glandular symptomatology. RATIONALE AND CONCLUSION One could say that the main underlying prescribing principle here is the application of the Law of Similars in the context of Organotherapy, or similia similibus curentur along the lines of the philosophy of Paracelsus and the Doctrine of Signnatures. It could also be defined as Iso-Organotherapy, since it is \"the use of homeopathically prepared healthy organ substances [i.e. sarcodes] to treat and therapeutically support that specific organ\" (Yasgur 1998). Otherwise it is simply therapeutics to enhance constitutional or totality treatment. Overall, choices of method or combination of remedies really depend upon the extent of the (identifiable) hormonal or glandular influence on the rest of the individual patient picture, how each one prioritises their bothersome symptoms and how the remedies fit with their presenting symptomatology at any given time during their journey to health. It is hoped that this overview, although by no means extensive, will help to clarify and illustrate the very intricately entwined functioning of our endocrine system and some of its likely influences upon our overall physical and emotional self. I have put a slight emphasis on the major female and male hormones, as the majority of my patients present with conditions that relate to the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and the menopause and because this article originally started out as a (short!) fact sheet. I deliberately have not included many other remedies that have endocrine affinities because firstly, it would detract from the focus of the article and secondly, such keynotes often become apparent following repertorisation.
