Our current health care focuses on eliminating the symptoms of the disease without eliminating the root of the problem. Many patients required more drugs just to treat side-effects of other drugs! While we bragged about the length of our average life span, the true health of our nation went downhill. There were very few children with obesity and high cholesterol when I first started my practice 21 years ago. Now, many patients under ten suffer from these conditions. I did a lot of research, studied many courses, and passed many board exams to re-educate myself in the field of Holistic Medicine. I started by practicing holistic medicine on myself, my family, and my friends and then integrated holistic medicine into my traditional pediatric practice and eventually opened my current practice dedicated completely to Holistic Medicine only. It was a great success, and it brought fulfillment and joy into the way I practiced medicine. I practice holistic medicine as an evidence-based medicine on scientific foundations. With an extensive initial lab test,we can figure out what's really wrong, what minerals or vitamins were deficient, and which hormones were out of balance. That way, we can start the right nutritional program, lifestyle education, supplements, herbs, or bioidentical hormones replacement. I also went back to my cultural roots and rediscovered the amazing power of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. You see, there is no one technique that can cure every person and every disease. Many complicated health conditions like ADHD, recurrent infections, hormonal imbalance, autoimmune diseases, anxiety and depression need many different treatment techniques. With my MD background and extensive training in holistic medicine, I have been able to orchestrate multiple modalities to improve these difficult health issues. I am not here to replace your primary care doctor but to work with him or her as a holistic consultant. Together we will help you get "}
