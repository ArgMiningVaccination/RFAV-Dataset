Naotada Sato PresidentPerformance during the Fiscal Year During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, exports and private capital investment supported a continuing moderate recovery in theJapanese economy. However, personal consumption showed no sign ofimprovement amid persistent deflation and an unfavorable employmentsituation. Consequently, the operating environment remainedchallenging. Positive trends in the U.S. economy established a basis for recovery while the economies of Asia expanded, led by China. As a result, theoutlook for the global economy began to brighten. Under these conditions, Meiji Seika worked throughout the Company to increase its earnings capabilities during the first year of its medium-term management plan, Challenge 2005. The objectives of this plan areto create profits in existing businesses, strengthen the ability of internalsystems to respond to change and generate growth by developing newbusiness areas. As a result, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 netsales increased 4.4 percent year-on-year to \u00a5368.9 billion, and operatingincome increased 43.2 percent year-on-year \u00a57.9 billion. Net incomedecreased 87.0 percent year-on-year to \u00a50.3 billion. Factors includedcosts to restructure production bases as part of our management structurereforms and expansion of our outplacement support program. Cashdividends per share totaled \u00a57.0, unchanged from the previous fiscalyear. Challenge 2005 Successes and Progress \"Becoming a More Competitive and Dynamic Company\" is the key theme for the Meiji Seika Group under the Challenge 2005 medium-termmanagement plan. Our objective is to achieve record earnings in fiscal2005, the year ending March 31, 2006. We are increasing our earningscapabilities by expanding net sales and by transforming our corporatestructure through structural reform. Challenge 2005 Objectives (For the year ending March 2006)Consolidated net \u00a57 billion During the past fiscal year, the first year of Challenge 2005, we promoted business development by enhancing synergy among our threecore businesses, the Food Company, the Pharmaceutical Company andthe Health Care Company, under the key theme of \"Health.\" Each ofthese three businesses also implemented management policies toestablish a stronger corporate structure and increase earningscapabilities. 2Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. Annual Report 2004In the Food Company's confectionery business, we changed the ingredients and production process for main product MILKCHOCOLATE for the first time in 77 years. This renewalgenerated substantial growth. In the food business, we workedto expand sales of cocoa, and sales increased strongly centeredon main product MILK COCOA. We also fortified our productlineup with the launch of the THEOBRO brand, based on thethemes of \"health and authenticity.\" Moreover, a domesticconsolidated subsidiary acquired the premium confectionerybusiness of the Maxim's de Paris brand, and began marketing itin April 2003. In the Pharmaceutical Company, aggressive sales activities and steady dissemination of scientific information concerningMeiji Seika's full lineup of anti-infectives resulted in firm salesgrowth of OMEGACIN and SWORD despite a challengingenvironment. Exports increased substantially, led by exports ofthe strategic international product MEIACT to the United States,China and Korea. Overseas subsidiary Tedec-Meiji Farma S.A.in Spain implemented initiatives such as adding to its lineup ofproducts. As a result, despite increasingly intense pricecompetition, sales increased substantially and contributed toMeiji Seika's overall results. In the Health Care Company's healthfood business, sales increased substantially as a result of an increase in loyalcustomers due to growing health consciousness and the clearbenefits of these brands. In addition, the KARADANAVI seriesof dietary supplements we launched in September 2003 offersfull support for better health, and steady efforts to popularize itcontributed to sales. In the over-the-counter (OTC) drugsegment, sales of each of the formulations of the main brandISODINE increased substantially, supported by effectiveadvertising and sales promotion campaigns. Key Tasks for the Current Fiscal Year During the year to March 2005, the second year of Challenge 2005, Meiji Seika will focus on four primarymanagement tasks.

The Food Company will work tostrengthen its presence in each category, including chocolate,candy, gum and cocoa, while aggressively working to expandits business by differentiating Meiji Seika brands in eachproduct area on the basis of high added value. In particular, wewill work to achieve consistent expansion to acquire a 30percent share of the chocolate category in Japan.

Annual Report 2004 15FINANCIAL STRATEGY The Meiji Seika Group's fundamental policy regarding distribution of profits is to take a long- term perspective in enhancing internal capital resources, expanding businesses and strengtheningthe Group's financial structure while providing reasonable, stable shareholder returns. The Meiji Seika Group is implementing structural reforms that include reducing inventory assets and divesting assets that do not generate sufficient returns. During the fiscal yearending March 31, 2005, the Meiji Seika Group plans to raise additional capital externally tofund increased expenditures for property, plant and equipment in connection with newconstruction and expansion of production facilities. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES The Meiji Seika Group encompassed Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. (Meiji Seika), 22 consolidated subsidiaries and one affiliate accounted for using the equity method as ofMarch 31, 2004. The 14 domestic subsidiaries include 10 companies in the food business, 2companies in the pharmaceutical business, 1 company in the health care business and 1company in other businesses. The 8 overseas subsidiaries include 3 companies in the foodbusiness, 4 companies in the pharmaceutical business and 1 company in other businesses.Meiji Seika added formerly unconsolidated subsidiary AZTECA Co., Ltd. to the scope ofconsolidation during the past fiscal year due to this company's increasing materiality. OVERVIEW During the year ended March 31, 2004, a moderate recovery continued in the Japanese economy, supported by exports and private capital expenditures. However, amid persistentdeflationary conditions and uncertain employment conditions, no signs of improvement inpersonal consumption were apparent. As a result, the operating environment remainedchallenging. In the global economy, prospects began to improve. The U.S. economy firmed on a foundation for recovery, while the economies of China and other Asian countries expanded. In this environment, the Meiji Seika Group embraced three management objectives: create profits in existing businesses; strengthen the ability of internal systems to respond tochange; and generate growth by developing new business areas. In each business sector, theMeiji Seika Group worked to establish a powerful corporate structure and increaseprofitability. As a result, consolidated net sales increased 4.4 percent year-on-year to\u00a5368,865 million, and operating income increased 43.2 percent year-on-year to \u00a57,881million. Net income decreased 87.0 percent year-on-year to \u00a5348 million due to costs torestructure production bases as part of our management structure reforms and expansion ofour outplacement support program. REVIEW OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Food Company Net sales for the Food Company increased 4.3 percent year-on-year to \u00a5238,414 million, and operating income increased 68.0 percent year-on-year to \u00a55,966 million. Confectioneries During the past fiscal year, the operating environment in the confectioneries market remained challenging due to factors including continued weakness in personal consumptionand a sharp rise in prices of imported raw materials. The Meiji Seika Group implementedtotal marketing measures for each of its core brands and developed clearly differentiatednew products. As a result, sales recovered and expanded. For chocolates, the Meiji Seika Group worked to expand sales by conducting aggressive sales promotions for main products. However, weaker sales of the seasonal product MOREFRAN due to the mild winter and other factors resulted in flat chocolate sales year-on-year.Sales of core product MILK CHOCOLATE were solid, supported by quality improvements inNovember 2003 and a new television commercial. Sales of ALMOND CHOCOLATE werealso firm, supported by television commercials that continued to feature popular soccerplayer David Beckham. New product ALMOND CRUST, introduced in February 2004,contributed to sales as well. For the core XYLISH gum lineup, the Meiji Seika Grouplaunched product renewals and also conducted sales campaigns and other energeticmarketing activities. The launch of this product in bottle-type packaging increased exposurein retail outlets, and sales increased substantially. Among other products, biscuits and KAJUGUMMY performed well, although sales of snacks and candy decreased. Food In the food market during the past fiscal year, consumer preference for low prices becameMANAGEMENT 'SDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. and its Consolidated Subsidiaries 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004363.4 358.9 361.9353.5368.9Net Sales (\u00a5 Billions) Operating Income and Operating Income to Net Sales (\u00a5 Billions / %) Operating income \u2014 Operating income to Net sales2000 2001 2002 2003 200419.118.0 13.0 5.57.95.35.0 3.6 1.62.1 16 Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. Annual Report 2004firmly entrenched, and stricter regulations related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and other issues made conditions challenging. The Meiji Seika Group developed high-value-added products and undertook aggressive marketing. Rising consumer awareness of the health benefits of cocoa have expanded the market. The Meiji Seika Group's focus on increasing sales of core product MILK COCOA generatedstrong results, and the launch of THEOBRO, a new product with high polyphenol content,strengthened the cocoa product lineup. Sales promotions to strengthen the GINZA CURRYbrand of retort-pouch curry products resulted in increased sales. Sales of healthfoods and products for the commercial market also expanded.Results among subsidiaries were generally firm, with sales of sugar, the core domestic product, remaining at the same level as in the previous fiscal year. Overseas, performance at Meiji Seika (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. was solid, although sales of U.S. subsidiary D.F. Stauffer Biscuit Co., Inc. were down due to intensifying competition. Pharmaceutical Company For the year ended March 31, 2004, sales of the Pharmaceutical Company increased 5.3 percent year-on-year to \u00a5108,504 million, and operating income increased 69.4 percentyear-on-year to \u00a53,838 million. Various reforms of the health care system such as the increase in co-payments for individuals under the National Health Insurance system implemented in April 2003 led tocontinued measures to further restrain drug costs, making the industry environmentincreasingly harsh. The markets for agricultural chemicals and veterinary drugs contracted,and price reductions among producers became more pervasive. Competition amongcompanies increased as a result, creating a highly challenging business environment. Ethical Drugs Among anti-infectives, the Meiji Seika Group's main ethical drugs, OMEGACIN, carbapenem anti-infective, and SWORD, an oral new-quinolone anti-infective,both performed strongly. Sales of core products MEIACT and HABEKACIN maintained aboutthe same level as in the previous fiscal year, while sales of FOSMICIN decreased year-on-year due to increasing competition resulting from contraction in the anti-infective market. For central nervous system (CNS) drugs, sales of antidepressant DEPROMEL remained firm, supported by steady activities to build awareness of it among the scientific community.Despite contraction in the anti-anxiety market, sales of MEILAX were about the same as inthe previous fiscal year. Among other ethical drugs, sales of ISODINE for external use as a disinfectant decreased year-on-year due to intensifying competition. Agricultural Chemicals and Veterinary Drugs Sales of agricultural chemicals increased firmly despite a difficult environment resulting from measures to counter the decrease in land under rice cultivation as steady salespromotions supported sales of core herbicides ORYZEMATE for rice blast and HERBIE. Sales of veterinary drugs increased substantially. Sales of existing products were solid, and the acquisition of the veterinary drug business of Eisai Co., Ltd. in February 2003 alsocontributed significantly to sales. Overseas operations generated strong sales growth. Exports of strategic international product MEIACT to the United States, China and Korea expanded. Performance of Domestic Subsidiaries Kitasato Pharmaceutical Industry Co., Ltd. manufactures and sells vaccines. Increased demand for influenza vaccine resulted in strong growth in sales. Sales of chemical productsmanufactured by FUJI-AMIDE CHEMICAL, CO., LTD. were nearly the same as in theprevious fiscal year despite reduced domestic and overseas demand resulting from increasedcompetition from overseas products. Health Care Company For the year ended March 31, 2004, sales of the Health Care Company increased 9.9 percent year-on-year to \u00a518,901 million. Operating income increased 0.8 percent year-on-year to \u00a5712 million. Healthfoods The healthfood market continued to expand, due to growing consumer awareness of self- medication and rising interest in beauty and dieting.

Annual Report 2004 17entering the market and competition in developing and marketing products is intensifying. Core product SAVAS meets the need to build body strength and prevent illness. Sales were strong during the past fiscal year as a result of aggressive marketing support activities,including providing nutritional support to top athletes and building awareness of the brandamong sports fans. In addition, sales of LOLA and Amino Collagen increased substantiallybecause their clear utility has supported expansion in the customer base. TheKARADANAVI series, launched in September 2003, is based on a close examination of theactions of the body. This brand offers full support for better health, and steady efforts topopularize it contributed to sales. Over-the-Counter (OTC ) Drugs In the OTC sector, reduced personal consumption and falling prices have restricted the scale of the market, and competition for market share has intensified. Price competition hasincreased for each of the products in the core ISODINE lineup, but advertising and salespromotions resulted in substantial sales growth. Sales of mini-drink Katsujin 28 alsoincreased strongly. Domestic consolidated subsidiary MEIJI SPORTS PLAZA, Ltd. operates sports club facilities. Competition with other sports clubs has intensified, but efforts to attract customerssupported firm sales. Office Building Leasing Revenue from Office Building Leasing decreased 11.0 percent year-on-year to \u00a52,706 million. Operating income decreased 47.7 percent year-on-year to \u00a5248 million in anextremely challenging environment. The opening of large-scale buildings has created anoversupply in the greater Tokyo area, and rents have fallen. In addition, due in part tocontraction of the business of some tenant companies, the occupancy rate of the Meiji SeikaGroup's core property, the Solid Square intelligent building, has decreased. Other Businesses Sales of Other businesses decreased 78.0 percent year-on-year to \u00a5338 million. Operating income totaled \u00a510 million, compared to an operating loss of \u00a532 million for theprevious fiscal year. The consolidated subsidiary that operates leisure and sports facilities worked to enhance its ability to attract customers. However, weak consumer spending, falling customer feesand intensifying competition resulted in the decrease in sales.

BUSINESS RISKS AND OTHER RISKS The following factors concerning the Meiji Seika Group's businesses and financial position described in its financial report ( yuka shoken hokokusho ) have the potential to exert a significant influence on investors' decisions. Statements in the text concerning thefuture are based on the judgment of the Meiji Seika Group's management as of March 31,2004, the end of the fiscal year under review. (1) Extraordinary Changes in Financial Position and Business Results For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, consolidated net sales were \u00a5368,865 million, a year-on-year increase of 4.4 percent, and operating income was \u00a57,881 million, a year-on-year increase of 43.2 percent. However, reorganization of production bases andexpansion of the outplacement support program as part of the Company's managementstructure reforms resulted in net income of \u00a5348 million, a year-on-year decrease of 87.0percent. (2) Extraordinary Changes in Cash Flow For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, net cash provided by operating activities was \u00a56,663 million, a decrease of \u00a52,949 million compared with the previous fiscal year. Themain reason for the decline was an increase in the employee retirement allowanceassociated with the expansion of the outplacement support program. (3) Legal Regulations The Meiji Seika Group's food business is subject to various laws and regulations such as the Food Sanitation Law. In addition, the Group's pharmaceutical business is subject topharmaceutical-related laws, including the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, and agriculturalchemical-related laws, including the Agricultural Chemicals Regulation Law. The Meiji Seika Group complies with the laws in its food, pharmaceutical and health care businesses, and works to maintain and strengthen its sanitary management system and toproduce appropriate labeling. However, product defects and other problems inherent to theGroup's businesses, general problems existing in society, and the occurrence of criminalacts have the potential to impact the Group's business results. (4) Procurement of Raw Ingredients In the Meiji Seika Group's food business, nearly all raw ingredients and major ingredients (cacao beans, nuts, etc.) are imported. In principle, the Group maintains a fixed level ofdomestic stock, and takes measures to disperse risks in producing regions. However, in theevent that the Group is unable to secure a sufficient volume of ingredients for an extendedperiod of time due to political conditions in exporting countries, global demand conditionsor other factors, the Group's production activities would be hindered, which could impactthe Group's business results. In addition, prices are currently trending higher for nearly all raw ingredients, and the Group is working to control costs by developing new procurement routes and promotingstreamlining. However, acceleration in this upward trend in prices in the future could affectproduction costs. (5) Contamination by Foreign Substances Today, greater safety and security in food ingredients is required, as symbolized by the issues of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the use of unapproved additives. TheMeiji Seika Group is working to ensure safe, secure ingredients in its food business throughmeasures such as shifting procurement to safer countries and strengthening inspection ofsuppliers. In the pharmaceutical business, the Meiji Seika Group manufactures products ranging from bulk pharmaceuticals to drug preparations under management that follows GoodManufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines stipulated by the Ministry of Health, Labour andWelfare. To prevent contamination incidents, the Group routinely conducts stringentproduction management and has incorporated the latest technology in an effort to improvethe structures and equipment of production facilities. However, there is no guaranteeagainst the possibility of contamination by foreign substances in any of the Group'sproducts. Contamination by foreign substances would have a serious impact on the 20 Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd.

(6) Revision of Drug Price Standard For the pharmaceutical products the Meiji Seika Group sells, drug prices are set as the basis for calculating drug costs in reimbursement of medical institutions for medicalconsultations, according to the National Health Insurance (NHI) drug price standardstipulated by the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare. An NHI price listing in this drugprice standard is necessary to sell prescription pharmaceuticals. As part of its policy for containing health care costs, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare makes periodic revisions of the drug price standard based on drug price surveys, forthe purpose of reflecting actual delivery prices of prescription drugs to medical institutionsin the drug price standard. With these revisions, the drug prices of most prescriptionpharmaceuticals are lowered, and market prices tend to decline proportionally. Years inwhich the drug price standard is lowered have a corresponding impact on the results of thepharmaceutical business. Since 1998, the NHI drug price standard has been reduced by an industry average of 9.7 percent in 1998, 7.0 percent in 2000, 6.3 percent in 2002, and 4.2 percent in 2004. (7) Pharmaceutical Research and Development For new drug development in the Meiji Seika Group's pharmaceutical business, rigorous inspections are performed by the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council based on testingdata, after an accumulation of various tests from basic research through manufacturingapproval. Consequently, the process from creation of a new substance to acquisition ofmanufacturing approval and market launch as a new drug typically requires ten to twentyyears. If research and development does not proceed as planned during this period, thelaunch of the product may be delayed. In addition, if the expected results are not obtainedor if safety problems occur, development may be suspended or terminated. Such cases havethe potential to impact the Group's business results. (8) Increase in Pharmaceutical License Fees and Royalty Payments While using limited research and development expenditures to advance research and development of multiple compounds, the Meiji Seika Group also aims to acquiremanufacturing and marketing approval for new drugs through rigorous inspections by theMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare. However, in development of ethical drugs, thecumulative success rate from new compound to acquisition of manufacturing approval is 1in 6,000. In these conditions, there are inevitably instances in which the launch of originallydeveloped drugs becomes difficult for a period, and the Group must rely on productslicensed from other companies. This causes an increase in license fees and royaltypayments, which has the potential to impact the Group's business results. OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2005 The Meiji Seika Group's operating environment is expected to remain challenging during the year ending March 31, 2005, which will be the second year of the Challenge 2005medium-term management plan. During the period, the Meiji Seika Group will continue tomove forward with structural reforms, assiduously reduce costs and shift to a more powerfulbusiness structure with the aim of improving results.

Annual Report 2004NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. and its Consolidated Subsidiaries 1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. (the \"Company\") and subsidiary companies have be en prepared from the consolidated financial statements in Japanese filed with the Kanto Finance Bureau as required by the Securities and Ex change Law of Japan, which are in conformity with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in Japan. These are different in cer tain respects from the application and disclosure requirements of International Accounting Standards. The consolidated financial statements are no t intended to present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles and practices gen erally accepted in countries and jurisdictions other than Japan. In preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements, certain reclassi fications have been made to present them in a form which is familiar to readers outside Japan. The accounts and the financial statements of th e Company and its subsidiaries are maintained in Japanese yen. For the convenience of the reader, the accompanying consolidated financial sta tements are also presented in U.S. dollars by arithmetically translating all Japanese yen amounts by using the exchange rate of \u00a5105.69 to $1 in effect at March 31, 2004. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Consolidation policy The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and significant subsidiaries (the \"Compa nies\"), over which the Company has power of control through majority voting rights or existence of certain conditions evidencing control by the Company. Investments in affiliates over which the Company has ability to exercise significant influences over operating and financial po licies of the investees, are accounted for on the equity method. The consolidated financial statements consist of the Company and its 22 (21 in 2003) significant subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Accounts of subsidiaries whose business year-ends differ by three months form March 31 have been included using financial information with appropriate adjustment. Inve stments in one (two in 2003) affiliate are accounted for on the equity method. The difference between the cost and underlying net equity at ac quisition of investments in consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates is allocated to identifiable assets based on fair market value at the d ate of acquisition. The unallocated portion of the differences is amortized over 5 years and 15 years on a straight-line basis. (b) Marketable securities Marketable securities are valued using the following methods. Securities that have market prices: Market valuation based on market prices at fiscal year-end. Differences in appraisals are ac counted for by incorporation of direct capital, and sales cost is calculated using the moving-average method. Securities that have no market prices: Cost method based on the moving-average method. (c) Inventories Inventories, including finished and semifinished products as well as work in progress, are valued at cost, which is determined mainly by the average cost method, except supplies and raw materials, which are stated at the lower of cost or market. (d) Income taxes The Companies provide for income taxes applicable to all items included in the consolidated statements of income regardless of when such taxes are payable. Income taxes based on temporary differences between tax and financial reporting purposes are reflected as def erred income taxes in the consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method. (e) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Deprecation of the assets of the parent company and domestic subsidiaries is calculated primarily by the declining balance method. However, depreciation of buildings and structures used in the leasing business that w ere acquired on or after April 1, 1996 is calculated by the straight-line method. Furthermore, depreciation of buildings (excluding attached fix tures) acquired on or after April 1, 1998 is calculated by the straight-line method. Overseas consolidated subsidiaries mainly used the straight-li ne method to calculate depreciation. (f) Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, which is calculated principally by the straight-line metho d. Commencing with the fiscal year under review, the Company's U.S. subsidiaries have adopted the U.S. Financial Accounting Standa rd Board's Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Accordingly, impairment studies will be conducted annually or w hen incidents that could possibly impair goodwill or other intangible assets occur to determine whether impairment has occurred. Following this standard, the U.S. subsidiaries have conducted impairment studies and determined that the fair value of their go odwill and other intangible assets lie above carrying value. Therefore, starting with the fiscal year under review, no amortization charges will be made to the consolidation adjustment account. Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. Annual Report 2004 27(g) Allowance for doubtful accounts To provide for losses on doubtful accounts such as accounts receivable, the Company charges to income an amount based on actual loss experience for normal accounts, plus an amount for projected unrecoverable amounts based on assessments of individual designated accounts, such as credits from companies in danger of bankruptcy. (h) Reserve for retirement allowances The Company and its principal consolidated subsidiaries provide for employees' accrued retirement benefits by charging to incom e the amount recognized as having been incurred based upon the projected amounts of the liability for accrued retirement benefits and pension assets at the end of the consolidated fiscal year. The difference at the time of accounting standard alteration (\u00a517,740 million) is being charged to income on a pro rata basis o ver seven years. The difference based on an actuarial calculation is charged to income beginning in the following consolidated fiscal year, usin g the pro rata amounts based on a specified number of years (seven) that is less than the average remaining period of employment for employees at the time the difference arises. (i) Leases For finance lease transactions, except for leases that transfer ownership of the property to the lessee, the usual accounting m ethod governing lease transactions is applicable. (j) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows are composed of cash on hand, bank deposits available fo r withdrawal on demand and highly liquid, short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less that can be readily converted into c ash and which represent a minor risk of fluctuation in value. (k) Translation of foreign currency Short-term and long-term monetary receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen a t the exchange rate at the consolidated balance sheet date. The foreign currency translation adjustment is accounted for as a gain or loss. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date of each overseas subsidiary. The translation adjustments are included in minority interests in consolidated subsidiar ies and in the foreign currency translation adjustment account in the shareholders' equity portion of the consolidated balance sheet. (l) Per share data Net income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents ad justed for free share distributions. 3.
