ALL RI ghTS RESERVED . staying w ell | 2understanding your options how do you choose the right medical treatment from everything that is available to you? This is one of the biggest questions you face as a person with M s. not so long ago, you wouldn't have had a choice. y our doctor would have decided for you from a limited list of possibilities. b ut today there are several ways to manage Ms and a long list of ways to ease M s symptoms. in order to understand and evaluate your options, and manage your M s over time, you need to be an active, informed consumer. This is particularly important if you choose to pursue an alternative or complementary therapy. h ere, it is much harder to identify and evaluate the risks and benefits. Therapies range from the widely accepted to the truly bizarre. To protect your health and your pocketbook, you must track down and scrutinize information from as many sources as possible. What are alternative therapies? The term alternative is difficult to define. w hen applied to health care, it encompasses everything from drugs and diets to food supplements, mental exercises, hands-on techniques, and lifestyle changes \u2014 virtually anything that is not included in traditional w estern medical practice.Alternative therapies come from many disciplines and traditions. They include acupuncture, aromatherapy, biofeedback, chiropractic, guided imagery, herbal medicine, homeopathy, hypnosis, hypnotherapy, macrobiotics, naturopathy, reflexology, relaxation techniques, traditional Chinese medicine, yoga, \"therapeutic touch,\" and various schools of massage, among others. some alternative treatments may be making their way into standard medical practice; some may be based on concepts that are impossible to translate into standard scientific thinking or to test with contemporary clinical trials; and some may be based on fads, fancies, or complete unknowns. Despite the challenges presented by such a wide range of possibilities, alternative medicine appeals to many Americans. Advocates of alternative therapies sometimes claim that conventional medicine is ignoring or suppressing treatments that can alleviate symptoms or even cure some diseases. opponents of alternative therapies challenge the advocates of unproven treatments to produce the scientific evidence that will substantiate their claims. As one outcome of this challenge, the n ational i nstitutes of h ealth evaluated acupuncture studies and concluded that there is clear evidence for its effectiveness for nausea related to surgery or chemotherapy. 1 | Clear Thinking about Alternative Therapiesstaying w ell | 4 3 | Clear Thinking about Alternative TherapiesWhy is it so popular? People want to believe that someone, somewhere, has the answer \u2014 or, at least, part of the answer. The inability of conventional medicine to cure certain illnesses or alleviate difficult symptoms can be deeply frustrating and frightening. in addition, people want to take responsibility for their own well-being. People with chronic diseases are often urged by their conventional health-care advisors to take a \"wellness\" approach to living with their disease. They are urged to improve their diet, exercise regularly, and take steps to support their emotional well-being. The distinction between these strategies and alternative therapies is very blurred. if an alternative treatment appears to be harmless, many people feel it's worth a try. Perhaps you agree. \" what do i have to lose?\" you may ask. unfortunately, there is plenty to lose with some alternative therapies. h ealth, money, hopes \u2014 even one's life can be at risk. That's why we've prepared this booklet. w e believe information can help people make their own best choices.separating fact from fiction There are many misconceptions about alternative medicine. here are some of the most common. n Fiction: Alternative medicine is completely natural and nontoxic. Fact: Not all alternative therapies use natural substances. And even a natural substance can be toxic. Remember, poison ivy is completely natural. n Fiction: Alternative medicine is non-invasive and painless. Fact: Some alternative therapies are invasive, painful, and may produce serious side effects. Examples include chelation therapy, colonic irrigation, and bee sting therapy. n Fiction: Alternative medicine is risk-free. Fact: Every test, treatment, therapy, and medication \u2014 whether conventional or alternative \u2014 carries some degree of risk. The question is, do the benefits outweigh the risks? Well-conducted, scientific studies or documented clinical experience can determine this, but studies and reports are not available for every treatment. In the absence of this kind of evidence, the experience of a seasoned MS clinician can provide valuable guidance. So can reference books and web sites from unbiased sources. n Fiction: If a person improves while using a treatment, that means it works. Fact: It's always good news when someone's condition improves. however, the improvement may be due to the natural course of the disease, not to the treatment. MS particularly is notorious for being variable. It can stabilize for no known reason at any time. or, the placebo effect may be responsible for the improvement. (See page 9 for more information on this.)staying w ell | 6 5 | Clear Thinking about Alternative Therapiesn Fiction: Conventional medicine has all the answers. Fact: No. Conventional medicine has not fully evaluated many of the treatments it currently uses. Doctors do not always know how or why some treatments work, but they use them anyway. h owever, reputable professionals avoid secrecy, and share information about their practices via journals, professional meetings, and correspondence. n Fiction: Conventional physicians reject alternative medicine. Fact: Not necessarily. Today, the term complementary medicine is used by mainstream physicians to refer to alternative regimens or therapies that their patients choose to use along with their conventional treatments. In other words, these therapies complement but do not replace the conventional treatment plan. A growing number of physicians are interested in this approach. Some medical doctors refer their patients to alternative medical practitioners. Some even administer complementary treatments themselves. And a few non-conventional therapies, such as meditation, have been tested and found to have some positive effects and are accepted by mainstream medicine. n Fiction: Alternative medicine is inexpensive and protects people from profiteering corporations. Fact: It is possible to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on alternative medicine. The nutritional supplement business alone is a multibillion dollar industry, with corporations both large and small vigorously marketing their products.Please b e Careful by e llen b urs Tein M ACFArlAne The diagnosis of M s is a shattering experience. This disease is unpredictable, the prognosis a question mark. w hile medicine can alleviate symptoms and, in some cases, slow progression, there is, as yet, no cure. i want to warn you that M s can make you desperate, and desperation makes you vulnerable \u2014 an easy target for snake- oil salesmen selling false hope and phony cures. i know. i was a victim. in 1986, i was working as an investigative consumer reporter for w CPX-TV in o rlando, Florida, when i learned i had a slow, progressive form of M s. in my job, i warned the public about bad people and bad deals, and i thought i knew every con. b ut illness is a great leveler. by 1991, my M s had become severe and progressive, and i was struggling to stay on my feet. As my condition deteriorated, so did my judgment. i first learned of Dr. i rving i . Dardik when a well-respected magazine did a cover story on him. Dardik, an impeccably credentialed vascular surgeon and former head of the o lympic Committee's s ports Medicine Council, claimed staying w ell | 6staying w ell | 8 7 | Clear Thinking about Alternative Therapieshis stress/recovery exercise program called s uperesonant wavenergy ( srwe ) would correct imbalances in the immune system and cure multiple sclerosis, l ou g ehrig's disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, and other chronic and fatal illnesses. when we met, i believed Dardik's enthusiastic assertion that he had the answer to M s. he emphasized he was not talking about a remission; he could cure me. i t would take a year and i would walk again. My family gave in to my plea to pay this man $100,000 \u2014 $50,000 of it up front. within seven months, my condition deteriorated. Dr. i rving i. Dardik's worthless cure and greed had taken a year of my life that i could not afford to lose. i had to quit my job, i needed 24-hour nursing care, and i now used a wheelchair full-time. Dardik offered no restitution. in July 1995, based on my complaint, the n ew york s tate Administrative r eview b oard for Professional Medical Conduct upheld a hearing committee's decision to revoke Dardik's medical license in n ew y ork s tate. There was also a penalty fine of $40,000. while there are honest and honorable people who offer alternative medical treatments, there are too many charlatans who will prey on your desperation to be cured of M s. Please be careful! how is alternative medicine different from conventional medicine? Conventional medicine quantifies the risks and benefits of a new treatment. b efore the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves any new drug or medical device, the product must demonstrate its safety and effectiveness in controlled clinical trials. ( see page 9.) The trials not only compare outcomes between those who received the therapy and a matched group who did not, they also ensure that the exact same therapy was delivered in exactly the same way to all participants. This is the only way a true comparison can be made. o nce the FDA has cleared the product for marketing, people are protected by disclosure requirements such as detailed package inserts in prescription drugs and \"informed consent\" procedures. it's worth noting that while drugs and medical devices are evaluated by the FDA, surgical procedures are not federally regulated. s tudies to determine the safety and efficacy of surgical interventions are often sponsored by government health agencies to review outcomes, and the American College of s urgeons supports an office of Continuous Quality improvement to review and disseminate best practices. 7 | Clear Thinking about Alternative Therapiesstaying w ell | 10 9 | Clear Thinking about Alternative TherapiesPeople who use an alternative therapy often have little or no idea of the risks that may be involved. There is little published documentation to substantiate claims about these therapies, and the documentation that is available may be unreliable. Claims are often based on anecdotal evidence. An anecdote is a story about an individual's experience. i t typically has not been measured against baselines or checkpoints to assure objectivity. The uneven application of standards reveals some of the problems. Dietary supplements and herbals are only lightly regulated by the FDA. The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that the product is safe but is not required to disclose information about the product's content, safety or benefit. h owever, a manufacturer is not allowed to make a claim that the product is a treatment or cure for a condition. i f a supplement label makes a general health claim, it must include a disclaimer saying that the FDA has not evaluated the product. The FDA's document, \"Tips for the savvy s upplement u ser,\" has helpful information for those exploring supplements. ( go to http://www.fda.gov and type the document title into the search box.) The controlled clinical trial Most clinical trials divide participants into two groups. one group gets the experimental treatment, the other gets a placebo , a look-alike but inactive treatment. o r they receive a standard, already proven treatment. The most reliable clinical trials are \"double-blind,\" which means that neither the patients nor the researchers know who is receiving which treatment.This kind of double-blind, placebo-controlled study allows researchers to separate the response to the test agent from responses produced by what is called the placebo effect . This refers to benefits caused by a patient's or a researcher's expectations about a treatment rather than by the treatment itself. you can't assume that a therapy works just because it is currently undergoing clinical trials. i t may well be proven ineffective. i n fact, only a small percentage of products that undergo clinical trials ever gain FDA approval. Doing better research on alternatives in 1992, the u .s. national i nstitutes of h ealth established the office of Alternative Medicine to fund research on the safety and effectiveness of alternative therapies. This office is now the n ational Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( www.nccam.nih.gov/research ). it awards grants to researchers in educational and research institutions around the country. i ndividuals can enroll on this site for a quarterly newsletter, \"CAM at the nih .\" Belief \u2014 a potent medicine our bodies respond to suggestion. s ome scientists think that a person's belief in a therapy causes the body to produce hormones called endorphins which act as natural pain-killers. This may ease pain and reduce discomfort. i n other words, believing can literally make it so for some period of time. staying w ell | 12 11 | Clear Thinking about Alternative TherapiesThe catch is that the placebo effect tends to diminish over time even when the person's belief remains strong. About 32% of people in clinical trials respond positively to placebos according to a groundbreaking 1955 study by h .K. b eecher. h e was not studying M s. experience in clinical trials for M s suggests the effect is even stronger in this disease. u p to 60% of people with M s have responded to an inert drug or sham treatment \u2014 at least for a short while. This demonstrates that the power of suggestion can be a powerful tool to improve the quality of life for many people with M s. but it can also lead people to believe that an expensive and ultimately useless treatment is essential. belief can work in the opposite direction as well. Participants in clinical trials may experience negative effects, such as headaches or nausea, even when they are in the placebo arm of the study receiving an inactive look-alike treatment. This response is called the nocebo effect. special issues in M s Clinical trials are particularly important in establishing the safety and effectiveness of new treatments for M s. Ms is a disease famous for spontaneous remissions. s o much is still unknown about this disease, and its course can be so different from one person to another, that it can be difficult to determine what works and what doesn't.Thus a new M s therapy is tested on a large number of people with similar forms of M s over a long period of time. The results give information that assures everyone that the treatment is likely to do more good than harm. Sorting it out some alternative treatments may improve general health or make it easier to deal with a troubling symptom. o thers could trigger a helpful placebo effect, if only for a limited time. o thers are ineffective and a waste of money and time. And still others are actually dangerous. so how can you tell what to avoid and what might be worth a try? The answer: Gather information (see checklist on page 22). Carefully and thoroughly inquire about any therapy you are considering. Keep asking questions until you get the answers you need. This is the only way to fully understand what you are getting into. n What does the treatment involve? n how and why is it supposed to work? n how effective is it? n What are the risks? n how much does it cost?staying w ell | 14 13 | Clear Thinking about Alternative TherapiesThree sample therapies, analyzed here is the bottom line on three therapies that have been promoted for use by people with M s: Chelation therapy \u2014 Ineffective and dangerous Description Chelation means \"the process of combining with and dissolving.\" A crystalline acid (EDTA) is injected intravenously over several hours. It chelates, or binds, heavy metals in the bloodstream, which are then excreted through the kidneys. Chelation is accepted therapy for lead poisoning and a few very rare disorders involving heavy metal accumulation. It is advocated by some alternative practitioners as a treatment for diseases as diverse as cancer, arthritis, heart attacks, strokes, MS, and Parkinson's disease. Evaluation The Food and Drug Administration, the Veterans Administration, and other professional associations call chelation therapy ineffective or inadequately studied for purposes other than heavy metal accumulation. There is no evidence that MS is caused by heavy metals in the bloodstream. Risks/Costs The therapy carries significant risk. It can cause kidney damage and is potentially lethal without adequate supervision. A course of treatment extending over several months can cost thousands of dollars.Removal of mercury-based fillings \u2014 Ineffective Description Dental fillings made of silver and mercury amalgam are removed and replaced. Proponents claim that mercury leaks from amalgam fillings and damages the immune system, causing a broad range of problems, including MS. Evaluation There is no scientific evidence to connect the development of MS with mercury-based dental fillings. Poisoning with heavy metals, such as mercury, lead, or manganese, can damage the nervous system and produce symptoms, such as tremor or weakness, similar to those seen in MS. h owever, the underlying mechanism of the nerve damage is completely different from MS. Risks/Costs Although it can be painful and might cause dental complications, the procedure is medically harmless. however, it is usually very expensive. Tai chi \u2014 h armless and may benefit general health Description Tai chi is an ancient Chinese system of meditative exercise. The participant concentrates on performing gentle patterns of movement that are described as bringing the body and mind into harmony. Tai chi is practiced by people of every age and physical condition. Evaluation Tai chi may lower stress, promote relaxation, relieve fatigue, and improve balance. Risks/Costs The exercises are safe. If necessary, they can be done in modified form from a seated position. The only costs are for instruction in a class or for a video.staying w ell | 16 15 | Clear Thinking about Alternative TherapiesDanger signals! Alternative medicine attracts many quacks and frauds. They claim their treatments can produce miracles. Quacks may be well intentioned and deeply convinced about the value of their remedy \u2014 or they may be crooks, plain and simple. either way, fraud produces misery in the form of wasted money, dashed hopes, and even direct physical harm. Suspect fraud if: n Promoters suggest an alternative treatment is a \"cure\" for MS. The grander the claim, the more alarming this signal is. n you must pay in advance. n The treatment is available from only one source or works by a \"secret\" formula. n A practitioner does not want to work with your medical doctor. n The promoters claim there is a medical or scientific conspiracy against them. n Advertising uses testimonials from \"satisfied customers.\" n The product or treatment is promoted by: > telephone solicitation, direct mail, or the Internet > a TV infomercial that uses a talk-show format > newspaper ads designed to look like news articles > a salesperson working for a multilevel marketing organization (known as \"pyramid marketing\")Look before you leap n Don't make your decision in a vacuum. Contact a variety of sources to get reliable, objective information about any alternative therapy you are considering. Begin by calling the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at 1-800-344-4867. And use the resources on pages 19. n Discuss the alternative therapy with your doctor. Ask for your doctor's views on the risks, benefits, side effects, and potential interactions with medications you are currently taking. Also ask about the experience of the doctor's other patients who have used the same therapy. A frank talk with your nurse may be helpful if you feel you and your doctor are not communicating well about this issue. n Find out if the alternative practitioner works with conventional doctors. Be sure that the practitioner is willing to refer patients to a physician. Avoid those who do not want to work with regular doctors. n Talk to people who have used the treatment. Firsthand knowledge is invaluable. Ask people who have used the therapy about its advantages, disadvantages, risks, side effects, costs, and the results they got from it. Try to track down these people yourself. Chat groups like those on MSWorld \u00ae can be helpful here. Don't rely on references supplied by the alternative practitioner or a person who is trying to sell you the product or service. n Investigate the background of any treatment provider. Find out about the person's training and credentials. In particular, determine how much experience this person has had treating people with MS.staying w ell | 18 17 | Clear Thinking about Alternative Therapiesn Thoroughly investigate any clinic that requires inpatient stays. Be particularly vigilant about any clinic (in the U.S. or abroad) that will not treat you as an outpatient. Find out why they require inpatient treatment. n Determine the costs. Ask about the cost for a full course of treatment. Some alternative therapies are very expensive and most are not covered by health insurance. Proceed with caution if you do decide to try an alternative therapy, continue to use your common sense. n Do not abandon your conventional therapy. one of the greatest dangers of alternative medicine is quitting conventional treatment in a headlong rush to embrace an alternative. only use alternative therapy in addition to, not in place of, treatment prescribed by a qualified physician. n Document your experience. Keep a detailed log of your experience. Record whom you consulted, what you took or did, and what changes you observed. A log will help you keep your doctor informed. n Keep your doctor up to date. Tell your doctor about all the therapies you are using. A physician who can't see the whole picture will be practicing medicine in the dark. y our doctor can alert you to possible side effects or interactions with your medications. he or she can also help you decide whether to continue a particular alternative therapy.A final word stay tuned for further developments. n ew findings are now common in the fast-moving world of modern medicine. An alternative therapy that you've considered using may be proven harmful. o n the other hand, some age-old folk remedy may prove to be the source for a new treatment. The best advice: r emain open-minded but skeptical. remember, every alternative treatment is suspect until it has been proven safe and effective.staying w ell | 20 19 | Clear Thinking about Alternative Therapiesreferences Web sites n The National MS Society offers local referrals, education programs, counseling, self-help groups, and other booklets and brochures on MS.
