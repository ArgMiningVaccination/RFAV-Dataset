Drug suppression, drug addiction, drug toxicity, poor lifestyles, and inactivity have compounded chronic problems. The practitioners that provide the best solutions will be those in greatest demand. Homeopathy provides the most comprehensive solutions for chronic pain that I have found in more than 40 years of integrative practice. Homeopathy, like chiropractic, addresses the underlying causes behind pain. Homeopathy is all-natural, safe, effective, and nonaddictive It has no known side effects or contraindications, and it provides the best answers the world drastically needs now. Combined with chiropractic and the natural healing techniques that we provide, homeopathy will empower the practitioner with the best answers to chronic pain on the planet. More than a third of Americans experience chronic pain. That's more than any of the chronic diseases plaguing our world today, including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes combined. Adding to this nightmare of chronic pain, Americans report each year an increase in the amount and severity of the chronic pain they are experiencing. Chronic pain is a messenger that should never be shot or suppressed long term. When it comes to chronic pain, people quickly learn that they cannot live by suppression alone. This is a great season and opportunity for chiropractors to shine. Specially equipped with the following tools, DCs will offer the most effective solutions to the chronic pain pandemic. Practitioners who offer real solutions for the causes of chronic pain will surely shine, be sought after, be highly esteemed, and make a premium income from the quality services and results they provide. Homeopathy awakens our vital force, or innate intelligence of the body's energetic control networks to heal and restore. Homeopathy is like chiropractic in a bottle, correcting nerve interferences throughout the brain and body where the hands of the chiropractor cannot, addressing the causes behind issues. Homeopathy actually empowers the chiropractor to correct interference throughout the whole nervous system, helping the whole person. From my many years of integrative health care, homeopathy has supplied and secured a primary essential role in the care and correction of chronic pain. These 23 homeopathic ingredients are my top remedies for the successful correction of chronic pain (see listed in sidebar on opposite page). The claims following each homeopathic ingredient are from human clinical studies called \"provings\" and listed in the Homeopathic Materia Medicas. Different from nutrition and herbs, these homeopathic ingredients can make the following claims. The following broad spectrum of homeopathic potencies has provided the broadest spectrum of therapeutic results. These potencies include: 1. 10X potency to address simpler, more superficial symptoms. 2. 30X potency to address internal-related metabolic functions of the body to regulate nutritional utilization and basic organ functions related to chronic pain control. 3. 100X potency to address the deeper internal related metabolic functions of the body, such as more complex hormonal communications, inflammation control, and homeostasis related to chronic pain control. 4. 1LM potency to address the mental, emotional, and genetic predispositions we have inherited from as deep as the past 10 generations. 5. 2LM potency to address the same as above in a deeper perspective. 6. 3LM potency to address the same as above in a deeper perspective. 7. 5LM potency to address the same as above in a deeper perspective. LM potencies in homeopathy were developed by the founder of homeopathy, Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, in the last decade of his homeopathic research. Dr Hahnemann called the LM potencies the most perfect potencies in the sixth addition of the Organon, the authoritative text of homeopathy. Dr Hahnemann found the LM potencies to function more effectively in all realms of the body \u2014 physically, mentally, emotionally, and genetically. The LM potencies worked deeper and were gentler in their corrective actions. They did not create the healing crises or detox reactions that the single potencies of the X and C may cause, especially in chronic complex conditions. A phase III study on using a pure water-based homeopathic spray included all the listed ingredients [in the sidebar] with 53 completed patients with musculoskeletal chronic pain to assess the efficacy and safety of the homeopathic spray formulation. All the subjects had long-term pain of at least two years or more. There were significant improvements in all parameters of WOMAC questionnaire, i.e., pain, joint stiffness, and physical function, as well as health assessment parameters of HAQ questionnaire, which shows the effectiveness of the homeopathic pain spray. Subjects also showed an increase in serotonin and decreases of urinary catecholamines and urinary cortisol, and significant reductions in the total of the combined QOL and WOMAC pain responses, confirming a decrease in stress and pain for these subjects. Safety: No serious adverse event has been reported by any patient enrolled in the study. Efficacy: As per the study protocol, the treatment of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain with homeopathic spray showed a significant improvement in a short span of 14 days. The study was performed by Apothecaries Private Limited. Results rule, especially when it comes to pain. Homeopathy rules when it comes to results with pain. Homeopathy provides fast results and longterm corrective results as well. Homeopathy provides the fastest delivery system of any form of treatment. Being an energetic medicine, homeopathy works through the nervous system and other energetic pathways like the acupuncture system. With the average nerve speed of 200 MPH, the healing responses of homeopathy are delivered to all 100 trillion cells of the body in approximately five seconds. That's much faster than the 15 to 20 minutes of the metabolic pathways. My Top Homeopathic Ingredients for Chronic Pain The following 23 homeopathic ingredients are my top remedies for the successful correction of chronic pain. The claims following each homeopathic ingredient are from human clinical studies called \"provings\" and listed in the Homeopathic Materia Medicas. Different from nutrition and herbs, these homeopathic ingredients can make the following claims. Actaea spicata (Baneberry) (Boericke): A rheumatic remedy, especially of the small joints with tearing, throbbing, tingling, and spasmodic pains. Aesculus hippocastanum (Horse chestnut) (Boericke): Back pain. Aching and soreness in limbs, sacrum, and hips. Arnica montana (Mountain arnica) (Boericke): A muscular tonic.

Bryonia (Bryony) (Boericke): Aching, soreness, stiffness, and weakness of joints. Calcarea carbonica (Carbonate of lime) (Boericke): Arthritis, stiffness, cramps, and weakness in neck and lumbar region. Calcarea fluorica (Fluoride of lime) (Boericke): For malnutrition low back pain. Causticum (Tinctura acris sine kali) (Boericke): Chronic arthritic the joints.

Zincum metallicum (Zinc) (Boericke): Spinal affections; Pain. When taken orally, homeopathy is first absorbed through the sublingual pathway, sending healing messages to every cell of the body. Applied topically, the nerve endings in the skin send the healing messages of the homeopathic remedy along the nerve pathways as well. We also recommend olfactory dosing. With a pure water spray, it is easily accomplished without any problems or discomfort by simply spraying the mist in front of the face and breathing a small amount in the air through the olfactory pathways that go into the frontal lobes of the brain and awaken the limbic system to provide the deepest therapeutic effects through our inner control networks. Each of the three delivery systems (orally, topically, and olfactory) provide a therapeutic realm the others may not. With its long-term effects using multiple potencies, homeopathy will provide deeper, more complete corrections from injuries. Most injuries will leave residual damage and dysfunction. Long after the pain has resided, and we think we are healed, deeper damage and dysfunction is commonly left behind. The deeper damage and dysfunction are found by palpation and muscle testing. Deep palpation around the associated joint will show tenderness at the origin and insertion areas of the tendons and ligaments. Testing the associated muscles will demonstrate weakness. These residual weaknesses create lack of stability of the joint. This is like an accident waiting to happen. A recurrence of the injury, a worse injury of degeneration over time can occur. All of this can be corrected and prevented using thorough chiropractic technique, musculoskeletal techniques, and homeopathy to work deeper to correct full musculoskeletal functions. Homeopathy will commonly provide results within a few seconds to minutes in many cases. It will also shorten healing time significantly. Everyone wants to go to the chiropractor who provides faster and more permanent results. Some practitioners may think this could mean fewer visits and less money. I have found the opposite to be true. Word gets around about better results. We built a million-dollar practice in a year in the 1980s that was built on better results. This is the chiropractor people are seeking, bragging about, and referring more people to. The better your results, the more people will listen and commit to the values of your long-term care. Homeopathic remedies and potencies will empower the chiropractor with an armamentarium to address the complexities behind many of the causes of chronic pain. Combining these ingredients and potencies has proven most effective and a simple way to powerfully address the chronic pain pandemic without doing extensive training or travel. I encourage every chiropractor to be the best you can be. Take on tackling chronic pain with the added armamentarium of homeopathic empowerment. Being able to provide fast, safe, all-natural, and corrective results with no known side effects, no known negative drug interactions, no known contraindications, and no known addictions will perfectly compliment the success of your chiropractic practice.
