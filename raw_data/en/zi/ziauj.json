The first is the actual expense from customer accounts that remai n 3 uncollected 90 days after their account has moved to a final status (note that a final status indicates that they are no longe r a customer). 4 The second component is the reserve for uncollectible accounts. Each month the reserve is calculated to determine the collect ability 5 of the accounts receivable portfolio. This value is compared to the amount reserved in the previous month and the difference used 6 to adjust the actual account expense. This total is then recorded as the total uncollectible accounts expense. 7 Outside Collection Agency Expenses 8 Expenses for outside collection agencies for the year 2013 are $2,171,067. The jurisdictional portion of the 2013 total Compa ny 9 amount is estimated to be $1,328,259 based upon the Delivery Service Revenue allocator. See WPA-5, Page 5. Total Company 10 expenses for outside collection agencies were $1,961,101, $1,004,856, and $1,022,834, for the years 2012, 2011, and 2010, 11 respectively.Schedule C-16 Page 5 of 5 Commonwealth Edison Company Uncollectible Expense Witness: Menon Line No. Description (A) 1 Summary of Collection Agency Contracts: 2 ComEd utilizes two forms of collection agencies in its collection process: final bill agencies and charge-off agencies. Final bill agencies r eceive accounts that have not paid their final b ills 3 from ComEd at Day 35 in the collection process stream. These agencies are given 90 days to work the accounts through their pro cesses to attempt collection. If the agency is successful 4 in retrieving money owed, they are paid a commission. If unsuccessful, the account is retrieved by ComEd and charged off (writ ten off). Charge-off agencies receive the charged-off 5 accounts the day after they are written off. Currently these agencies work the written-off accounts until ComEd retrieves them for some other type of treatment such as debt sale. 6 These agencies differ from final bill agencies in the time frame in which they are allowed to work the accounts and their overall commission incentives. In an effort to increase recoveries, 7 both tiers have the ability to report deli nquent customers to credit bureaus, after following the FDPPA (Federal Debt Protection Practices Act) guidelines. 8 Collection Agency Results: 9 In 2013, 148,014 accounts with a total value of $77.6 m illion was sent to final bill agencies.
