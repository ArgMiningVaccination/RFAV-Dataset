If you scroll down to the bottom real quick and take a look at my profile picture there, you'll notice that I have on a pair of glasses. I've worn glasses since I was a freshman in high school, and even shadowed a handful of optometrists under the fascination of eye health, curious about whether that was a career for me. While the fear of dislodging foreign objects out of people's eyes ultimately turned me away from the studies of optometry, I was still fascinated with the eye, and more urgently - my own personal eye health as I saw my prescription lenses get stronger and stronger over the years. The eye is kind of like a camera: You have the pupil that acts as an aperture to allow more or less light in, and you have a powerful lens that works with your retina for variable focus to keep an object in sharp detail across different lighting environments [. As light enters the eye, the pupil contracts and allows the right amount of light to pass through to the lens. Even though we need light to see, too much exposure can damage the sensitive tissues in our eyes, and even affect other tissues exposed to light, like our skin. The light we are exposed to from the sun ranges from ultraviolet, to visible, to infrared ](#reference-) [. Ultraviolet light is the most intense of the three and can have lasting damaging effects on our eyes and skin. It is outside of the visible light spectrum, so we can't see it, but ultraviolet light does enter the eye and focuses its damage on the lens ](#reference-) [.](#reference-) After ultraviolet, the next wavelength of light is visible light. Visible light interacts with the eye differently than ultraviolet light, because we can actually see the visible light spectrum and it is therefore compatible with the physiology of the eye. For instance, visible light enters the eye and passes through the lens and to the back of the eye, where it is absorbed at the retina [.](#reference-) When it comes to violet and blue light within the visible light spectrum, the damaging intensities are somewhat similar to ultraviolet. This can be problematic for the eye, because these wavelengths of visible light interact with sensitive cells in the eye and can overwhelm them with various forms of photodamage [. Studies describe the damage that blue light can have on the eye and other tissues as causing photochemical injury (i.e., creating free radicals and oxidative damage), photothermal injury (i.e., exciting and changing the state of how tissues are structured) and photomechanical injury (i.e., increasing sheering stresses that can damage the structure of tissues) ](#reference-) [.](#reference-) The beautiful thing about a healthy diet is that nature has provided specific antioxidants to absorb and counteract the damaging effects that are specific to blue light. What is doubly fantastic is that the human body recognizes where this antioxidant is needed most and stores it in the eye's retina for immediate blue light protection. That antioxidant is a carotenoid known as lutein [. Lutein is found in high amounts in kale, and to a lesser extent in spinach, summer squash, and even egg yolks 1. The goal is to consume enough lutein-rich foods to supply a strong antioxidant support for our eyes. The problem is that nearly every electronic device and LCD screen, as well as the fluorescent lights around us, all emit blue light, creating a generation of greater blue light exposure than ever before ](#reference-) [. What was once an achievable amount of lutein to consume to balance our blue light exposure is now drastically overwhelmed by our environment and electronic surroundings. When we are exposed to excessive blue light, the lutein concentrations that are stored in the retina decrease - and along with that, our antioxidant protection](#reference-) [.](#reference-) What is further interesting about lutein is that the amount that is stored in the retina is correlated with the amount of lutein that is stored in the brain [. Many components of brain function, like memory, learning, concentration and decision-making have been tested and shown to be significantly correlated with the concentrations of lutein in the retina ](#reference-) [. So not only does blue light have the potential to negatively influence your vision but your brain health and ability to age gracefully as well.](#reference-) Similarly, many studies comparing lutein supplements to a placebo have found that within the first few weeks of introducing up to 20 mg of lutein in the diet daily, brain function, eye health, and skin health all improved [. Supplemental lutein supports the elasticity, hydration, natural skin oils, and antioxidant protection for skin health to help combat the intense photodamage from the sun ](#reference-) [.](#reference-) With technological advancements and gadgets being implemented all around us, our exposure to blue light is increasing every year. Whereas most studies showed significant improvement in brain, eye and skin health with supplementation of 20 mg of lutein, data from the CDC indicates that most Americans consume only about 0.6 mg per day [. Not only do I encourage families to increase their consumption of leafy green, cruciferous vegetables, like kale, to get more lutein and other nutrients in their diet, but to supplement with lutein to fortify their health against the increasing concentration of blue light in our environment.](#reference-) Sign-up for {N}power to get exclusive "}
