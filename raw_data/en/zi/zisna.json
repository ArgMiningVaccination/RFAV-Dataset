OUR PHILOSOPHY Much of our philosophy is based on two books we are happy to recommend: - Servan-Schreiber David [Anticancer : A New Way of Life](http://www.anticancerbook.com/) Penguin Books Ltd., 2008 - Harter Pierce Tanya [Outsmart Your Cancer: Alternative Non-Toxic Treatments That Work](https://www.outsmartyourcancer.com/) Thoughtworks Publishing, 2009 The fundamental principles of Integrative Medicine can be found in these excellent books: - Micozzi Marc S [Complementary and integrative medicine in cancer care and prevention : foundations and evidence-based interventions](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/complementary-and-integrative-medicine-in-cancer-care-and-prevention-marc-s-micozzi/1128013193) Springer Publishing Company, 2007 - Rakel David [Integrative Medicine](https://www.elsevier.ca/ca/product.jsp?isbn=9780323496179) Elsevier, 2017 - Wisneski Leonard A Anderson Lucy [The Scientific Basis of Integrative Medicine](https://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Basis-Integrative-Medicine-Second/dp/1420082906) CRC Press, 2009 We recommend the following YouTube video on the subject... ...As well as the [CancerAction.Org](http://www.canceraction.org.uk/) and [CancerTutor.Com](https://www.cancertutor.com/) websites. We collaborate with the [HealthCreation](https://www.healthcreation.co.uk/) organization which represents holistic cancer treatment. We recommend acquainting yourself with HealthCreation due to their comprehensive and applicable approach to fighting cancer and a very long experience from cancer care in the UK. Once you've found something you believe in and want to try out, we suggest that you, together with your doctor, integrate your choices with the care you are currently receiving, so that this doesn't interfere with your conventional medical treatment. Please also consider acquainting yourself with [CancerActive.Com](https://www.canceractive.com/cancer-active-page-link.aspx?n=3061&Title=Building%20an%20Integrated%20Treatment%20Programme) and start outlining your action plan. When you ultimately feel that you have reached a conclusion about Integrative Medicine Therapies, please consider a final check by investing some money in purchasing the \"Moss Report\" on your specific cancer and the corresponding Complementary and Alternative Medicine applicable for your kind of cancer, at [CancerDecisions.Com](http://cancerdecisions.com/). If The Moss Report supports your decision, then you are standing on a very firm ground. WHAT IS INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE? Integrative medicine is complementary care used alongside conventional care. It combines the best of both types of care. Integrative medicine shows us how all organs and cells are not isolated systems but work together in an integrated fashion to maintain best possible health. According to Wisneski & Anderson (2009) many diseases such as cancer arise as a result of stressors that perturb homeostasis. Addressing these initial stressors is necessary for healing to occur. An integrative approach tends to open our minds to consider healing modalities often overlooked in the western medical establishment. Micozzi (2007) shows that complementary and integrative medical modalities, with their promise of gentler, less invasive, \"more natural\" approaches, hold promise for cancer treatment, prevention, and control. Cancer is a challenging area of medicine for the application of integrative medicine. The amount of misinformation often seems to exceed the amount of real clinical scientific information available. We intend to give our readers a positive view of this type of medical expertise without indulging into irresponsible claims. SCIENTIFIC STUDIES Over 7 000 scientific studies on integrative medicine and cancer are currently listed in the search database of the [National Institutes of Health ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=integrative+medicine++cancer), and valuable information is found in [Medline Plus](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000932.htm) We are constantly keeping a watchful eye on recent studies in the area. AN IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER! We sometimes speak without deviation and perhaps sound fearsome, but our hope is that Petrafoundation will provide you with the information you need to understand what cancer is and how it can be fought through measures that are within your own reach.
