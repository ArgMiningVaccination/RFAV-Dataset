It is commonly called the \"brain-eating ameba\" because it can cause a brain infection when water containing the ameba goes up the nose. Only about three people in the United States get infected yearly, but these infections are usually fatal. You cannot get infected from drinking water contaminated with Naegleria. You can only be infected when contaminated water goes up into your nose. Symptoms usually start with severe headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting and progress to stiff neck, seizures, altered mental status, hallucinations, and coma. Naegleria fowleri infects people when water containing the ameba enters the body through the nose. This typically happens when people go swimming, diving, or when they put their heads under fresh water, like in lakes and rivers. The ameba then travels up the nose to the brain, where it destroys the brain tissue and causes a devastating infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). PAM is almost always fatal. Naegleria fowleri infections may also happen when people use contaminated tap water to rinse their sinuses by sending water up the nose. In very rare instances, people have gotten Naegleria fowleri infections from recreational water that didn't have enough chlorine in it, such as pools, splash pads, or surf parks. There is no evidence that Naegleria fowleri can spread through water vapor or aerosol droplets (such as shower mist or vapor from a humidifier). Recommended preventative steps include: - Avoid jumping or diving into bodies of warm fresh water, especially during the summer. - Hold your nose shut, use nose clips, or keep your head above water when in bodies of warm fresh water. - Avoid putting your head under water in hot springs and other untreated geothermal waters. - Avoid digging in, or stirring up, the sediment in shallow, warm fresh water. The amoebae are more likely to live in sediment at the bottom of lakes, ponds, and rivers. Resources: Other Uniformed Service Members, Veterans, and their Spouses The Arkansas Act creates two licensing pathways for veterans and their spouses, automatic or expedited. Who does it apply to? The Arkansas law applies to: - Uniformed Service Members that the SCRA does not cover. - Uniformed Service Veteran who resides in or establish residency in Arkansas. - The spouse of a Uniformed Service Member that the SCRA does not cover. - The spouse of a Uniformed Service Veteran who resides in or establish residency in Arkansas. - The spouse of a Uniformed Service Member who is assigned a tour of duty that excludes the uniformed service member's spouse from accompanying the uniformed service member and the spouse relocates to this state; - A uniformed service member who is killed or succumbs to his or her injuries or illness in the line of duty if the spouse establishes residency in the state. Automatic Licensure: Certain licensing entities provide automatic licensure under state law. The individual must contact one of the listed licensing functions and: - the individual is a holder in good standing of occupational licensure with similar scope of practice issued by another state, territory, or district of the United States; and - the individual pays the applicable licensure Pathology and Audiology](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/arkansas-board-of-examiners-in-speech-language-pathology-and-audiology) [Board of Examiners of Alcoholism & Drug Abuse Counselors](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/arkansas-state-board-of-examiners-of-alcoholism-and-drug-abuse-counselors) [Board of Dispensing Opticians](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/arkansas-state-board-of-dispensing-opticians) [Board of Chiropractic Expedited Licensure: Arkansas law does allow licensing entities to submit rules for an expedited process versus an automatic process.

HPV vaccine protects against infection with the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause several types of cancer in both men and women. The vaccine also prevents most genital warts and cervical precancers. Gardasil 9, which protects against 9 HPV types, is the only HPV vaccine currently in use in the United States. What Cancers Does HPV Cause? HPV can cause oropharyngeal (back of mouth and throat), cervical, penile, anal, and vulvar cancers. HPV is estimated to cause nearly [36,500 cases of cancer](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cases.htm) in men and women every year in the United States. HPV vaccination can prevent 33,700 of these cancers by preventing the infections that cause them. Who Should Get HPV Vaccine? When Should They Get It? All children age 9-12 years, both boys and girls, should get two doses of HPV Vaccine, given 6-12 months apart. Early protection works best. That's why HPV vaccine is recommended earlier rather than later, since it protects children best when given before they ever have contact with the virus. Teens and young adults should be vaccinated too. Everyone through age 26 years should get HPV vaccine if they were not fully vaccinated already. Some adults age 27 through 45 years who were not already vaccinated might choose to get HPV vaccine after speaking with their doctor about their risk for new HPV infections and the possible benefits of vaccination for them. How Well Do These Vaccines Work? HPV vaccination works extremely well. - Since HPV vaccination was first recommended in 2006, infections with HPV types that cause most HPV cancers and genital warts have dropped 88% among teen girls and 81% among young adult women. - Fewer teens and young adults are getting genital warts. - HPV vaccination has also reduced the number of cases of precancers of the cervix in young women. - The protection provided by HPV vaccines lasts a long time. People who received HPV vaccines were followed for at least about 12 years, and their protection against HPV has remained high with no evidence of decreasing over time. Is the HPV Vaccine Safe? HPV Vaccine is very safe. Over 15 years of monitoring have shown that HPV Vaccines are very safe and effective. Like all vaccines, scientists continue to monitor vaccines to ensure they are [safe and effective](https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/vaccinesafety.html). Where Can I Find These Vaccines? HPV Vaccine is available in many doctor's offices and clinics, especially those that take care of children and young adults. Many pharmacies also vaccinate children and adults for HPV. In addition, all of ADH's [Local Health Units (LHUs)](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/health-units) give HPV vaccinations to all children and some adults. How Do I Pay for These Vaccines? Most health insurance plans cover routine vaccinations like HPV vaccine. The [Vaccines For Children](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/vaccines-for-children) (VFC) program also provides vaccines for children 18 years and younger who are uninsured, underinsured, Medicaid-eligible, American Indian, or Alaska Native. In AR many clinics that care for children, as well as some pharmacies, are VFC providers. In addition, all of ADH's [Local Health Units](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/health-units) is HPV? HPV or Human Papillomavirus is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD). HPV is a different virus than HIV and HSV (herpes). HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active men and women get it at some point in their lives. There are many different types of HPV. Some types can cause health problems including genital warts and cancers. But there are vaccines that can stop these health problems from happening. Signs and Symptoms - Most people have no symptoms - Develop within weeks or months after exposure, or not at all - Soft fleshy lumps on or near genitals or anus - Itching or burning around genitals - Warts may be hidden in the vagina or anus - The warts may go away with treatment, but the HPV infection can persist - In 90% of cases, HPV disappears spontaneously within 2 years after infection Transmission Genital Warts are spread by: - Vaginal sex - Oral sex (rare) - Anal sex - Contact with infected person's warts - Infected mother to newborn (very rare) - Warts/HPV may be spread even if no warts are visible because the virus may be present on areas not protected by a condom Complications If left untreated, Genital Warts can: - Spread to sex partners - Be passed to newborn during childbirth; can cause warts in infant's throat (very rare) Some virus strains lead to abnormal Pap tests and increased risk of cervical cancer, but these strains do not cause visible warts. Sexually active women should have yearly Pap tests starting 3 years after they first had sex. HPV may also play a role in cancers of the anus, mouth/throat, penis, and vagina. A physician may perform a special test to identify the cancer-associated strains. Prevention - Gardasil-9 is the vaccine available for males and females age 9-26 years of age to protect against the types of HPV that cause most cases of cancer and genital warts. - HPV vaccination is also recommended for some people age 27-45 years of age if they are not already vaccinated. People in this age range should speak to their doctor about the benefits of HPV vaccine for them. - The surest way to avoid transmission of sexually transmitted diseases is to abstain from sexual contact or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be uninfected. - Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, can reduce the risk of transmission only when the infected areas are covered or protected by the condom. - Use a new latex condom properly for any sexual contact. - Limit the number of sex partners. Testing and Treatment - Get an exam from a medical provider if infection is suspected. - Warts can be treated, but HPV cannot be cured. - HPV requires medical treatment by doctor. - Drugstore treatment for other kinds of warts may be harmful if used on genital warts. \"High risk\" HPV strains that cause cancer do not cause visible genital warts. But, high-risk strains may be present along with visible warts. The body may eventually clear the virus with or without treatment. The HPV vaccine that is licensed by the FDA, recommended by CDC and currently distributed in the USA is Gardasil-9 (made by Merck).

If you or your team would like to participate in an assessment, [click the link here](https://adhredcap.arkansas.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=8CC8CMTKA7) to request an ICAR visit and, ideally, you will receive communication regarding your request within two business days. Ambulance Service Applications Please download and submit the applications with applicable fees to the Section of EMS: ASBP - Complaints ASCC Programs & Connection](/images/uploads/pdf/ASCC_Spinal_Connection.pdf) is Eligible for Services from Arkansas Spinal Cord Commission?] The Arkansas Spinal Cord Commission serves only Arkansas residents who have sustained a spinal cord disability. - The individual must be an Arkansas resident at the time of referral. - The individual may be of any age, ASCC provides services to individuals with spinal cord disabilities from birth to death. - The disability must be severe enough to meet the agency's medical criteria. Arkansas state law (ACA 20-8-206requires that: Every public and private health and social agency and attending physician shall report to the commission within five (5) calendar days after identification of any spinal cord disabled person.... Within fifteen (15) days of the report and identification of a spinal cord-disabled person, the commission shall notify the spinal cord-disabled person or the most immediate family members of their right to assistance from the state, the services available, and the eligibility requirements. If a healthcare professional, individual with a spinal cord disability or another interested individual identifies someone with a spinal cord disability, contact the Arkansas Spinal Cord Commission to make a referral. It is better to refer someone who is not eligible than not to refer someone who is eligible for services. To make a referral, contact the regional Case Management office or call the ASCC administrative office at 501-296-1788 or 800-459-1517 between 8am and 4:30pm. Monday - Friday. Confidential fax is available 24 hours a day at 501-296-1787. You can find the [ASCC Referral Form here](/images/uploads/pdf/ASCC-1a_Referral_Fillable_Form.pdf). Damage to the Spinal Cord Spinal cord disabilities result from damage to the spinal cord. ASCC serves only Arkansans whose spinal cord has been damaged. This damage may result from a traumatic spinal cord injury, from a birth defect such as spina bifida or sacral agenesis, or a disease process of the spinal cord including spinal cord tumors, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, or spinal stenosis. This list of diagnoses is not exhaustive and if a health care provider or individual has an individual whom they believe may qualify for services, that individual should be referred and an ASCC Case Manager will be assigned to collect medical records and information to determine the spinal cord disability. Individuals with disabilities of the spinal column that do not affect the spinal cord, the brain or brain stem (only without cord involvement) or the peripheral nerves typically do not qualify for ASCC services. Medical Criteria Once an individual is determined to have a spinal cord disability, the ASCC Medical criteria are applied. The medical criteria assess the actually disability or limitations in function resulting from the spinal cord damage. For the purpose of determining disability, the four criteria listed below are used. An individual must have at least three of the following symptoms. Medical records or information will be used to verify these criteria: - Lack of Normal Motor Control / Paralysis - A lack of normal voluntary motor function. There should be enough weakness and/or spasticity to significantly interfere with normal self-care activities and/or mobility. In most cases, this will require the use of a wheelchair, scooter, walker, braces (including AFOs, KAFOS), crutches, or cane for mobility. In some cases, particularly those with a diagnosis of central cord syndrome, the paralysis may be more severe in the arms and hands than in the legs to the point that adaptive devices or assistance is required for completing activities of daily living such as feeding, dressing, and hygiene. - Lack of Normal Sensation - A lack of normal sensation at or below the level of lesion that results in absent or impaired ability to discern touch, pressure, pain (the ability to tell sharp from dull), or temperature (the ability to tell hot from cold). The individual should have enough loss of sensation to have more than normal risk to the skin and musculoskeletal structures. - Loss of Normal Bladder Control - The lack of ability to voluntarily empty the bladder in a timely manner without accidents or the use of equipment or medication. Frequently, individuals with spinal cord injury will present with a neurogenic bladder. When this condition is present, it is usually obvious with symptoms of either urinary incontinence (involuntary voiding) or urinary retention (inability to void). However, with minimal spinal cord damage, the symptoms may be subtler. - Loss of Normal Bowel Control - The lack of ability to voluntarily empty the bowel in a timely manner without accidents or use of equipment or medication. Frequently, individuals with damage to the spinal cord will present with a neurogenic bowel. For additional information regarding the ASCC Medical Criteria, please see the Arkansas Spinal Cord Commission Policies and Procedures Manual policy CS-3 - Medical Eligibility Criteria. Financial Criteria The Arkansas Spinal Cord Commission and our Case Managers provide numerous services to individuals who have met the medical criteria, including life-long case management, counseling, guidance, advocacy, resource identification, referral for other services, technical assistance, and other services without regard to income. When an individual needs purchased services or financial assistance in obtaining equipment or services related specifically to the spinal cord disability, the individual must also meet financial criteria. In order for ASCC to assist a client with purchased services: - The individual must complete a Financial Resource Assessment with the Case Manager that includes information about earned and unearned income, savings, assets, and spinal cord disability-related expenses. - There must be no other resource (insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, personal savings, etc) available to assist with the purchase. An ASCC Financial Eligibility Assessment has been completed no more than 1 year from the date of purchase. - The expenditure or service must be related to the spinal cord disability and a covered service under ASCC procedures. The Commission has specific guidelines and limits on some services.ASCC follows Arkansas State Procurement laws in all purchasing. - ASCC does not make purchases related to normal living requirements including but not limited to; housing, utilities, food, clothing, vehicles, or medical insurance payments. The Commission is precluded from making any van modifications. - The Commission is precluded from making any payment for any hospitalization. For additional information regarding the ASCC Financial Criteria please see ASCC Case Management Procedures Manual, Chapter 5, Determining Financial Eligibility For additional information regarding the procedures and array of services purchased by ASCC, please see ASCC Case Management Procedures Manual, Chapter 10, and Purchasing Services for your Client. Please note, the ASCC budget for purchased services is small and the agency may not be able to make purchases to meet all of the client's needs due to these budgetary constraints.

Humans that get avian influenza usually have come in direct contact with infected birds, birds that have died from avian influenza, or bird droppings from infected birds. \"Bird flu\" typically refers to an influenza A virus type called H5N1. There are two types of influenza A H5N1: highly pathogenic and low pathogenic. The H5N1 strain commonly called \"bird flu\" is the highly pathogenic type. This virus strain typically infects wild waterfowl, such as ducks. Birds infected with highly pathogenic H5N1 virus can experience very mild to very severe symptoms, including death. Rarely, do domestic birds, such as chickens, also get infected with \"bird flu\" H5N1. In poultry, it causes severe illness and death. In rare instances, the \"bird flu\" virus can be transmitted to humans primarily through direct exposure to infected birds or the environment where the infected birds live. When people get infected with \"bird flu\" virus, it can cause severe illness and death. Currently, avian influenza H5N1 does not pass easily between people. For more information about \"bird flu\" in humans, please visit the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-in-humans.htm). It is important to remember that HPAI is primarily a production and economic concern for our poultry industry. It is safe to consume properly handled and cooked poultry products, including meat and eggs. Current US Situation as of November 30, 2022 There is ongoing surveillance throughout the US and the world to look for \"bird flu\" in migratory waterfowl. In the US, the US Department of Agriculture, the US Department of the Interior, and the US Department of Health and Human Services work together on this surveillance. The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 strain has been identified in the United States. More information on surveillance and positive results in both domestic and wild birds can be found on the [USDA website](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza).

[Arkansas Department of Health Avian Influenza Prevention Measures and Post-Exposure Monitoring Instructions](/images/uploads/pdf/Avian_Influenza_Packet.pdf) What is avian influenza (bird flu)? Avian influenza, also called bird flu, is caused by a virus that infects birds such as chickens, turkeys, geese, pigeons, and pheasants. The virus is found in an infected bird's poop as well as fluids from the bird's eyes, nose, or mouth. Bird flu doesn't usually infect people, however, there are a few ways you can get infected. A person can be infected with bird flu if they: - Touch their eyes, nose or mouth after working with infected live or dead birds. - Touch their eyes, nose, or mouth after visiting places where infected birds have lived. - Breathe in droplets or dust contaminated with the virus. - Have close contact with a person already sick with the disease, though this is rare. Symptoms of bird flu range from mild eye infections to a flu-like illness. In severe cases, bird flu can cause pneumonia and death. Who can get bird flu? Most humans are unlikely to get bird flu. Individuals who work with animals, such as veterinarians, farmers, animal industry experts, and wildlife professionals, or people who visit poultry farms or live-animal markets may be more likely to get infected. What can people do to prevent bird flu? There is no vaccine to prevent bird flu, but there are steps you can take to protect yourself. - Avoid touching birds and visiting places where birds live - Do not touch birds whether they are alive or dead. - Avoid visiting live bird and poultry markets. - Avoid Germs - Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. - If soap and water aren't available, clean hands with hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. - Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean. - Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. - Try to avoid close contact, such as kissing, hugging or sharing eating utensils or cups with people who are sick. If you feel sick and think you may have bird flu, particularly if you have a fever, talk to a healthcare provider and tell them about any contact with birds. Stay away from other people while are sick. Preparing Food The Arkansas poultry industry maintains rigorous health and safety standards, including routine monitoring for avian influenza. It is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry; there is no concern of avian influenza risk in processed poultry products. Always properly handle and cook poultry products: - Clean: Wash hands and surfaces often. - Separate: Separate raw meats and poultry from other foods. - Cook: Cook all poultry to 165\u00b0F. - Chill: Refrigerate promptly.

Mpox [Symptoms](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/monkeypox#Monkeypoxsymptoms) 1-800-803-7847 The first case of Mpox in Arkansas was identified in July 2022. |Cases of Mpox in Arkansas| |79 cases yesterday)| |Last Updated: 9.8.23| * [For Mpox case data and vaccine locations, click here to visit the data hub](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/2ea83bc80b244a1680ff0ac1d89f23db/)* The symptoms of Mpox include fever, headache, muscle pain, and a painful rash that occurs seven to 14 days after exposure. The rash may be located on or near the genitals or anus but could also be on other areas like the hands, feet, chest, or face Mpox is spread through close contact and can be transmitted to anyone regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity. It can be spread by direct skin-to-skin contact with infectious rash, scabs, or body fluids. This can include household and/or intimate contact. Spreading can also occur when contacting contaminated items, such as clothing. It may be transmitted through contact with respiratory secretions; however, it is not an airborne illness. Mpox is NOT spread through casual, brief conversations or walking by someone with Mpox, like at a grocery store. Contact a healthcare provider right away to talk about diagnosis, testing, and treatment options. If you do not have a health care provider, please contact the ADH call center at 1-800-803-7847 to locate a local health unit near you. Antiviral drugs are also available for the treatment of the illness. Although most cases are self-limiting without treatment, you might need treatment if you have severe disease, are immunocompromised, have a history of atopic dermatitis or other active exfoliative skin conditions, are pregnant or breastfeeding, or have a concurrent disease or other comorbidities. Decisions about treatment should always be discussed with your medical provider. Treatment can also be used when lesions develop in the eyes, mouth, or other anatomical areas where Mpox virus infection might constitute a special hazard (e.g., the genitals or anus). - Currently, there is no treatment explicitly approved for Mpox virus infections. However, antivirals developed for use in patients with smallpox may prove beneficial against Mpox. TPOXX is an antiviral medication being used as an investigational treatment. If your medical provider feels this would benefit you, please contact ADH at 1-800-803-7847. There are vaccines available for people who meet the criteria. It is recommended that you talk with your healthcare provider before being vaccinated. The preferred vaccine to protect against Mpox is Jynneos, which is a two-dose vaccine. It takes 14 days after getting the second dose of Jynneos for its immune protection to reach its maximum. The vaccine is not effective once symptoms have started. Vaccine Location Map For Providers Testing is currently available through several large commercial laboratories, including LabCorp, Quest, Aegis, Sonic Healthcare, and Mayo Labs. For providers planning to test through a commercial lab, there is no need to contact ADH prior to testing. For providers needing to test through ADH's Glen F. Baker Public Health Lab, call ADH's Outbreak Response Section first at 501-537-8969. Specimen receiving is M-F 8am to 7:30pm at PHL. Specimens can be stored at 2-8 C until ready to ship.

Violent death is a major public health issue in Arkansas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) defines violent death as a death that \"results from the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or a group or community.\" The Arkansas Violent Death Reporting System (ARVDRS) collects and links key details of violent deaths- the \"who, when, where, and how\" - and delivers insights into \"why\" these deaths transpired. Arkansas received grant funding from the CDC in 2018 to create the ARVDRS. ARVDRS pulls data from law enforcement reports, death certificates, and coroner/medical examiner reports (including toxicology) and logs this data into a de-identified database. These sources individually provide data that explain violence in a fragmented, narrow context, but when linked together, a more comprehensive picture of violent death is created. The purpose of utilizing the ARVDRS is to implement a plan to collect and disseminate accurate, timely, and comprehensive surveillance data on all violent deaths occurring within the state to better guide prevention efforts. ARVDRS includes deaths that result from: - Homicides - Suicides - Deaths of undetermined intent - Unintentional firearm injury deaths - Deaths due to legal intervention Resources: [National Violent Death Reporting System](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/) Reporting System) The State Unintentional Drug Overdose Surveillance (SUDORS) is a supplemental program to the NVDRS which is funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Overdose Data to Action grant. SUDORS collects detailed information on all fatal overdose deaths in Arkansas. SUDORS increases the timeliness and comprehensiveness of reporting fatal drug overdoses by capturing information from death certificates, coroner and medical examiner reports, and toxicology reports. These sources include details such as route of administration and risk factors that may be associated with a fatal overdose. The data collected can be analyzed to provide stakeholders with information on overdose prevention response efforts.

The best way to protect yourself and your baby against COVID-19 is to get vaccinated. What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is an illness that affects the lungs and breathing. It is caused by a new coronavirus. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and trouble breathing. COVID-19 may also cause stomach problems, such as nausea and diarrhea, and a loss of your sense of smell or taste. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after you are exposed to the virus. Some people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. How does COVID-19 affect pregnant and recently pregnant people? Reports and research show that pregnant and recently pregnant women have a higher risk of more severe illness from COVID-19 than nonpregnant women. Reports note that: - Pregnant women who have COVID-19 and show symptoms are more likely than nonpregnant women with COVID-19 and symptoms to need care in an intensive care unit (ICU), to need a ventilator (for breathing support), or to die from the illness. Still, the overall risk of severe illness and death for pregnant women is low. - Pregnant and recently pregnant women with some health conditions, such as obesity and gestational diabetes, may have an even higher risk of severe illness, similar to nonpregnant women with these conditions. - Pregnant women who are Black or Hispanic have a higher rate of illness and death from COVID-19 than other pregnant women, but not because of biology. Black and Hispanic women are more likely to face social, health, and economic inequities that put them at greater risk of illness. Visit the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html)to learn more about these inequities. Reports also note the following for pregnant women with COVID-19: - They may be more likely to have pregnancy complications than pregnant women without COVID-19. These complications may be related to high blood pressure, heavy postpartum bleeding, and other infections. This is especially true for pregnant women with moderate and severe illnesses. - They may have an increased risk of preeclampsia (a serious blood pressure disorder) and coagulopathy (a blood clotting disorder). How can COVID-19 affect a fetus or newborn? Reports of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have shown the following: - There is an increased risk of preterm birth. - Some data suggest a possible increased risk of stillbirth. - COVID-19 may pass to the fetus during pregnancy, but this seems to be rare. After birth, reports have shown the following: - In babies born to women who had COVID-19 during pregnancy, there is an increased risk that the newborn will need care in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). - A newborn can get the virus if they are exposed to it. Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine? Yes, you should get a COVID-19 vaccine. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG) strongly recommends vaccination if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to get pregnant. Read [COVID-19 Vaccines: Answers From Ob-Gyns](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/covid-19-vaccines-answers-from-ob-gyns) to learn more, and talk with your obstetrician-gynecologist (ob-gyn) if you have questions. Key points to remember: - Pregnant and postpartum women have a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19 than nonpregnant women. - Stay healthy by getting a COVID-19 vaccine, following guidelines from health officials, and keeping your prenatal and postpartum care visits. - If you are pregnant and have COVID-19, talk with your ob-gyn. - Get a booster shot as soon as you are eligible to get one.

Alzheimer's Disease - Alzheimer's disease involves parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language. It is a progressive disease beginning with mild memory loss and possibly leading to loss of the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to the environment. - Alzheimer's is a specific disease. Dementia is not. - Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of dementia cases. - Though the greatest known risk factor for Alzheimer's is increasing age, the disease is not a normal part of aging. - Although most people with Alzheimer's are 65 and older, approximately 200,000 Americans under 65 are living with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease. Related Dementias - Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. - Dementia describes a group of symptoms associated with a decline in memory, reasoning, or other thinking skill. - Dementia is not a normal part of aging Alzheimer's is the most common type of dementia, but there are many kinds: - Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease - Lewy Body Dementia - Down Syndrome and Alzheimer's Disease - Frontotemporal Dementia - Huntington's Disease - Mixed Dementia - Normal Pressure - Hydrocephalus - Posterior Cortical Atrophy - Parkinson's Disease Dementia - Vascular Dementia - Korsakoff Syndrome Alzheimer's in Arkansas - One out of three seniors who die annually is diagnosed with Alzheimer's or another dementia. - Alzheimer's disease was the 4th leading cause of death among Arkansans aged 65 years and older compared to the national rank as the 5th leading cause of death in 2018. - Arkansas ranked 23rd among states for Alzheimer's disease mortality in 2013, however, moved up to 13th in 2018, indicating more Arkansans aged 65 years and older are succumbing to Alzheimer's disease over time. Take Brain Health to Heart What's good for your heart and blood vessels is also good for your brain. Recent studies have shown that risk factors for heart disease and stroke, such as physical inactivity and obesity, also contribute to conditions such as memory loss, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and reduced cognitive ability. Older adults with Alzheimer's and other dementias are more likely than other older adults to have multiple chronic conditions, and Alzheimer's complicates the management of these conditions, resulting in increased hospitalizations and costs. The good news is that there are steps you can take that will help your heart and your brain. 10 Ways to Help Improve Your Brain Health - Don't Use Tobacco - Be Physically Active - Eat a Healthy Diet - Maintain a Healthy Weight - Get Enough Sleep - Stay Engaged - Prevent and Manage High Blood Pressure - Prevent and Manage High Cholesterol - Manage Blood Sugar - If You Drink, Do So in Moderation Although age, genetics, and family history cannot be changed, other risk factors can be changed or modified to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. In fact, the 2020 recommendations of The Lancet Commission on Dementia prevention, intervention and care suggest that addressing modifiable risk factors might prevent or delay up to 40% of dementia cases The Importance of Caregivers - About one in three Alzheimer's caregivers report their health has gotten worse due to care responsibilities. - Increased risk of stress, depression, unhealthy behaviors, and poor attention to their own health. - Caregivers of people with dementia with diabetes or osteoporosis were 2.6 and 2.3 times more likely, respectively, to report emotional difficulties with care compared with caregivers of people with dementia who did not have these co-occurring conditions. What are we doing at the Arkansas Department of Health? The Arkansas Department of Health is an awarded recipient of the CDC Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, Public Law 115-406, for Public Health Programs to Address Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (CDC-RFA-20-2004). BOLD funding is being used to: - Increase the number of stakeholders engaged in state-wide AADRD collaboration. - Promote education about the importance of risk reduction (primary prevention), early diagnosis (secondary prevention), prevention and management of comorbidities, avoidable hospitalizations (tertiary prevention), and the role of the caregiver. - Increase healthcare professional education about the importance of all three levels of prevention, and the importance of caregivers as a vital part of the healthcare team. - Increase the number and types of health communications with the integration of brain health and dementia risk.

Please see the attachment for the announcement and agenda. Arkansas has emerged as a leader in Coordinated School Health programs. Across the state, Coordinated School Health is growing, and districts are building school level-health teams. With the help of ACT 1220 of 2003, district and school wellness committees are required to assess themselves using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's School Health Index, completing modules 1-4, 10, and 11, and then use the results to create an improvement plan. The School Health Index results are used to develop their School Health and Wellness Improvement Plan (which is required for accreditation). Through grant funding from the CDC, free quarterly professional development opportunities are provided for all school personnel based around the Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC-pronounced \"whisk\") Model. CSH also funds six school districts to implement district-wide changes to improve the health of their students, faculty, and community. These districts were chosen based on their willingness to implement change and a variety of needs such as obesity rates, childhood chronic disease rates, and free and reduced lunch rates. Coordinated School Health Schools The 132 districts that participate in Coordinated School Health are innovators in their districts and apply for grants and develop plans to improve school health using the scorecard from their School Health Index. Typically, these schools have a high-functioning wellness committee and a tenacious wellness committee chairperson who attends quarterly CSH meetings regularly. If you work for a district and are ready and willing to implement healthy changes and would like to join us, please email the CSH coordinators to be added to the CSH distribution list. You will receive grant notifications, meeting alerts, webinar alerts, quarterly newsletters, and access to all our partners' updates and alerts as well. The schools targeted in the current funding cycle are: - Blytheville - El Dorado - Magazine - Malvern - Marvell-Elaine - Springdale Arkansas Department of Health, CSH Advisor, [Ariel Rogers](mailto:ariel.schaufler@arkansas.gov), (501) 280-4148.

Funding Opportunities Joint Use Agreements (JUA) The Arkansas Joint Use Agreement (JUA) Grant is a competitive application process made possible and supported by Arkansas' governor and the Arkansas Tobacco Excise Tax. These funds help schools adopt and implement joint use policy which allows schools to form community partnerships to maximize resources while increasing opportunities for physical activity. Funds are available each fiscal year based on Tobacco Excise Tax appropriations or until funds are expended. Click [here](https://dese.ade.arkansas.gov/Offices/learning-services/school-health-services/joint-use-agreement-jua) for more information. School-Based Health Centers (SBHC) School-Based Health Centers are a great way to coordinate campus services to cover the medical and mental health services students need. Each center must provide basic physical and mental health services no matter their ability to pay. Some centers also include dental services on campus or provide campus-linked services to a provider not located on school grounds. This program functions as a collaboration between the Arkansas Department of Health and the Arkansas Department of Education. The School-Based Health Center funding is a once-a-year competitive grant process where districts can apply for up to $500,000 for a 3-year grant cycle. Former grant cycles lasted 5 years. Click [here](https://dese.ade.arkansas.gov/Offices/learning-services/school-health-services/school-based-health-center-sbhc) for more information on School-Based Health Centers. Student Wellness Advocacy Group (SWAG) SWAGs are aimed at helping students in 7 - 12th grades learn to advocate for themselves and for healthier campuses. Each year the Arkansas Department of Health funds up to 12 campuses to host SWAGs, providing them with funding, presentations on varying health and advocacy topics, and guidance on advocacy projects in their school, community, or state. For more information about SWAGs click [here](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/state-school-health-and-wellness). Project Prevent Youth Coalition (PPYC) Project Prevent is the statewide youth tobacco prevention coalition in Arkansas. For more information on PPYC click [here](https://projectpreventar.org/). Assessment Tools, Data, Resources State School Health and Wellness Act 1220 of 2003 created the role of the Act 1220 Coordinator/State School Health and Wellness Coordinator. The Act 1220 Coordinator (State School Health and Wellness Coordinator) works with the 1,102 schools in the 262 districts to ensure the requirements of Act 1220 of 2003 and related state and federal school health mandates are met. The main goal is to lower obesity rates by supporting best practices in food service, nutrition, physical, and health education. The State School Health and Wellness Coordinator work with school and district wellness committees to help ensure their annual School Health Index (SHI) and School Health and Wellness Improvement Plan are accurately completed and submitted by the October 1st deadline. Also, the Coordinator helps schools in reviewing and updating their School Wellness Policy, provides technical assistance, trainings related to school wellness, and regular updates on school wellness data and reporting. While the school environment is the primary focus of the State School Health and Wellness Coordinator, the role also works to increase partnerships between communities and their schools. The State School Health and Wellness Coordinator discusses the impacts of student health on academics, long-term health, and community strength. Additionally, communities are encouraged to reach out to local schools to engage in conversations about local school wellness programs and initiatives and how they can support school wellness. In efforts to increase student driven initiatives in school health and wellness programs, the State School Health and Wellness Coordinator at the Arkansas Department of Health started the Student Wellness Advocacy Group (SWAG) Initiative beginning in the 2018-2019 school year. This program is a partnership between the Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Program (TPCP) and the Office of School Health Servicestoprovide health education and teach students how to have conversations about their health and how to improve it. Advisors work with SWAG participants to discuss content, projects, and how to use funding.

Integrating access to the Arkansas PDMP database within an Electronic Health Record (EHR)/Pharmacy Management System (PMS) provides a streamlined clinical workflow for providers. The integration eliminates the need for providers to have to log in separately to the PDMP. Instead, the EHR/PMS automatically initiates a patient search and returns a view of the patient's controlled substance prescription history report directly within the provider's EHR/PMS. PMP Gateway is a multi-state query system that provides access to a majority of state PMPs. Bamboo Health, through its PMP Gateway product, facilitates communication, information transfer, integration, and support for the state approval process, and the EHR/PMS vendor development process. Dispenser Reporting As mandated, a dispenser is required to report the dispensation of any controlled substance that is schedule II - V as listed on the [Arkansas Pharmacy Controlled Substance List](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/pharmacy-services-drug-control) to the Arkansas Department of Health Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. A pharmacy is required to report at a frequency of the next business day while a veterinary clinic is required every 30 days. If no controlled substances were dispensed, then a zero report is required. If a pharmacy does not dispense controlled substances, the pharmacy may apply for a waiver exemption.

Please contact the Office of Health Information Technology at [SHAREhealth@arkansas.gov](mailto:SHAREhealth@arkansas.gov) or call at 501.410.1999. What is Electronic Case Reporting (eCR)? Electronic case reporting (eCR) is the automated, real-time exchange of case report information between electronic health records (EHRs) and public health agencies. It moves data quickly, securely, and seamlessly from EHRs in healthcare facilities to state and local public health agencies. eCR uses a centralized platform that allows systems to communicate with each other in real-time. eCR runs behind the scenes in the EHR to automatically capture and report required information. If the information entered in the EHR matches codes of interest to public health, the data necessary for a public health report are sent to the platform. If the data meet jurisdictional reporting requirements, the report is sent to the appropriate public health agencies for investigation and follow-up. eCR is a joint effort of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and CDC. These organizations play key roles in leading, implementing, and operating eCR with healthcare organizations, EHR vendors, and public health agencies. Benefits of Reporting using eCR: eCR benefits everyone involved in case reporting. It provides timely and more complete data than manual reporting and decreases the burden on both healthcare facilities and public health staff. For Public Health Agencies: - Provides timely and complete data to support outbreak management and monitor disease trends - Efficiently monitors the spread of reportable diseases during outbreaks and public health emergencies - Reduces response time with automated information - Improves communication and collaboration with healthcare by enabling bidirectional data exchange - Supports the submission of case-based data (without identifiable information) to CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. For Healthcare Providers: - Reduces burden for healthcare providers without disrupting the clinical workflow - Saves time by eliminating manual data entry and reporting - Can fulfill legal reporting requirements - Provides real-time reports to public health officials to guide the state, tribal, local, and territorial response to public health threats - Facilitates communication and collaboration between healthcare and public health - Streamlines reporting to multiple jurisdictions - Receives information from public health associated with the reportable condition - Can be implemented for all reportable conditions Informacion de Vacunacion - COVID-19 COVID-19](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/vacunacion-contra-el-covid-19) Aunque el desarrollo de vacuna el COVID-19 estado marcadas State Medical Board Mission The Medical Board's mission is to protect the public and act as their advocate by effectively regulating the practices of Medical Doctors, Osteopathic Medical Doctors, Physician Assistants, Respiratory Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Occupational Therapy Assistants, Radiology Practitioner Assistants, and Radiologist Assistants, Licensed Genetic Counselors and registration of Surgical Assistants and Medical Corporations.

In recent years, many clinics and hospitals have shifted from paper charts to electronic health records. More than 37 percent of office-based physicians in Arkansas implemented an EHR system in 2011(according to the Department of Health & Human Services), and the adoption of EHR systems continues to grow. In 2013, all Arkansas hospitals are using an EHR system, and experts estimate that more than 60 percent of office-based Arkansas physicians currently use an EHR system. A digital health care infrastructure provides many benefits over paper systems. But just like paper charts, electronic health records are stored within a clinic or hospital system and are rarely shared with your other providers. As a result, your doctors seldom have access to all your health information, which they need to give you the best care possible. The Arkansas State Health Alliance for Records Exchange (SHARE) is a state-wide health information exchange (HIE) that solves this problem. SHARE allows participating doctors, nurses, specialists, health services professionals, and public health authorities to access and securely exchange with each other real-time, electronic patient information that is protected by federal and state privacy and security laws. SHARE provides health information in a standardized electronic format and enables medical data to follow patients rather than being housed in separate physician's offices or within a single hospital system. SHARE can greatly improve the completeness of patient's records, which can have a major effect on care as medical history, current medications, and other information is reviewed during visits. Appropriate, timely sharing of vital patient information through SHARE can better inform decision-making at the point of care and allow providers to: - Avoid hospital readmissions - Avoid medication errors - Improve diagnoses - Decrease duplicate testing - Improve patient care coordination - Promote improved management of chronic diseases. Participating SHARE providers have access to their patients' lab results, X-ray reports, medication allergies, and other vital information. By viewing health histories in SHARE, health care providers will have more complete medical information to provide high-quality care and coordinate treatment with other health care providers.

Arkansas State Board of Chiropractic Examiners The State Board of Chiropractic Examiners was created by Act 126 of 1915, as a regulatory board to: - Provide for the licensing and examination of chiropractors. - Ensure that any person practicing or offering to practice chiropractic in the state is qualified and licensed. - Safeguard the public health and welfare of the citizens of Arkansas. The Arkansas State Board of Chiropractic Examiners provides access to resources and other information on this Web Site as a public service.

Any person or legal entity may file a complaint or report a violation to the board. Such complaints may be submitted in writing, along with the ASBCE Uniform Complaint Form, and should state facts, which indicate possible misconduct by the licensee. The board may act on its own initiative if evidence of misconduct comes to the attention of the board. A complaint may also be filed through the online complaint portal [HERE](https://asbce.portalus.thentiacloud.net/webs/portal/). When filing a complaint give full details, which should include facts, details, and dates. Attach all billing document records, correspondence, and contracts. If the doctor is licensed by the Arkansas State Board of Chiropractic Examiners a letter is mailed to the doctor along with a copy of the complaint requesting a response within ten days. Upon receiving a letter of response from the doctor the investigation committee determines whether further investigation is warranted or whether an informal disposition may be attempted by settlement, consent, agreement, or for lack of sufficient probable cause. Upon completion of an investigation, the Board investigation committee determines whether a disciplinary hearing should be scheduled to resolve the issue. The licensee has a right to a fair hearing. Procedures, which protect the licensee's rights, while allowing the board to conscientiously enforce its rules, are essential to an effective disciplinary environment.

A child may be diagnosed with PANDAS when: [Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/), tic disorder, or both suddenly appear following a streptococcal (strep) infection, such as strep throat or scarlet fever. - The symptoms of OCD or tic symptoms suddenly become worse following a strep infection. The symptoms are usually dramatic, happen \"overnight and out of the blue,\" and can include motor or vocal tics or both and obsessions, compulsions, or both. In addition to these symptoms, children may become moody or irritable, experience anxiety attacks, or show concerns about separating from parents or loved ones.

It only goes into effect if we are terminally ill or have lost decision-making capacity, and it is usually completed in advance of any known illness. We complete it ourselves (no one else may complete the form for you), and unless there are other known facts, it must be honored. To become valid, it must include the signatures of two witnesses. All adults should have an Advance Directive. Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care This legal document authorizes someone chosen by an individual (called an 'agent') to make decisions on their behalf if they are no longer able to speak for themselves. The agent makes decisions on behalf of the patient which is aligned with their known or stated preferences for ongoing medical care. AR POLST does not replace the above forms but can be used to operationalize the directives of the living will. Advance Care Planning Resource for Patient & Families The Center for Practical Bioethics shares The Caring Conversations\u00ae Workbook to guide you, your family, and your friends through the process of advance care planning with a highly individualized focus. The Workbook includes a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare Decisions form as well. [Click here](https://www.practicalbioethics.org/featured-resources/caring-conversations/) to access. POLST - Forms & Directions Providers AR POLST form is available through the Arkansas Department of Health website. Changes to the form are made through the legislative process. [Click here](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/polst) to download the current AR POLST form. AR POLST (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment) is an easily identifiable pink document that translates a patient's goals of care and treatment preferences for end-of-life care into a physician order that transfers across AR health care settings. The AR POLST form represents a \"plan of care\" for a patient with a life-limiting illness and is modeled after the Physician Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) Paradigm which is used in many states. The document should be completed after a thorough discussion with the patient, and if the patient is incapacitated, by his/her legal health care representative* regarding the patient's understanding of the illness, treatment preferences, values, and goals of care. Completion of an AR POLST form encourages communication between doctors and patients, enables patients to make informed decisions, and clearly documents these decisions to other physicians and health care professionals. As a result, AR POLST can help ensure that a patient's wishes are honored, prevent unwanted or non-beneficial treatments, and reduce patient and family stress regarding decision-making. AR POLST does not replace an advance directive for health care but can be used to operationalize the directives of the living will. The AR POLST form is an essential part of health information records that travels with the patient as he/she moves from one health care setting to another. A copy should always be kept in the patient's chart or medical record and be immediately accessible by other health care providers as necessary across care settings. An AR POLST form may be revoked/voided at any time by the patient or legal proxy. Please [click here](https://vimeo.com/414601769/c5d91ebc4e) for a detailed video describing AR POLST. Please [click here](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/PhysicianFeeSched/Downloads/FAQ-Advance-Care-Planning.pdf) to learn about physician and nurse practitioner billing for ACP discussions. Compliance with AR POLST In some cases, physicians have been hesitant to follow AR POLST orders without first reassessing the person's wishes in the current clinical situation. However, the AR POLST form states that the orders on AR POLST form should be followed until a review is completed by the accepting health care professional. The AR POLST form should be followed even if the physician who has signed the document is not on the medical staff of the facility. Health care institutions are encouraged to develop policies and procedures for the use of AR POLST. The Impact of AR POLST Research has shown that documents like AR POLST are making a difference in end-of-life care. It serves as a useful tool for starting a dialogue with patients regarding their wishes about end-of-life care. Studies in states that have POLST available have revealed that among patients with completed POLST documents, treatment preferences were respected 98% of the time, and no one received unwanted CPR, intubation, intensive care, or feeding tubes. As a result, POLST has helped to bridge the gap between preferred treatment options and the actual treatments patients receive. Heart Disease Maps Arkansas Minority Health Commission Mission To assure all minority Arkansans equitable access to preventive health care and to seek ways to promote health and prevent diseases and conditions that are prevalent among minority populations. The Commission supports its mission through: - Studying issues relating to the delivery of and access to health services for minorities in Arkansas; - Identifying any gaps in the health service delivery system that mainly affect minorities; - Making recommendations to relevant agencies and to the legislature for improving the delivery and access to health services for minorities; and - Studying and recommending whether adequate services are available to ensure future minority health needs will be met. Vision The AMHC's vision is that minority Arkansans have equal opportunity and access to health care and preventive well care. Goals Our goal is to be a catalyst in bridging the gap in the health status of the minority population and that of the majority population in Arkansas. To accomplish this, the commission focuses on addressing existing disparities in minority communities, educating these communities on healthier lifestyles, promoting awareness of services and accessibility within our healthcare system, and making recommendations to relevant agencies, the Governor, and the state legislature.

The AMMRC was developed with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Building US Capacity to Review and Prevent Maternal Deaths and is modeled after well-established review committees in the United States. To improve maternal health outcomes, you must begin with understanding the factors that contribute to maternal mortality. The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) established inter-and intra-agency agreements to identify maternal deaths and to access records to facilitate committee review. Through data collection and analysis of clinical factors, preventability, and social determinants, the AMMRC seeks to identify factors that lead to poor maternal health outcomes and to make recommendations that will decrease maternal mortality and morbidity. Membership The AMMRC is a multidisciplinary committee whose members represent the state of Arkansas. The members consist of various specialties, facilities, and systems that interact with and impact maternal health. The members are appointed by the Arkansas Secretary of Health and consist of specialists in obstetrics and gynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, anesthesiology, nursing, psychiatry, mental/behavior health, nurse midwifery, public health, hospital association, patient advocacy, and more. Recruitment of new AMMRC members occurs as needed. All AMMRC members serve in a volunteer capacity and do not receive compensation for participation in the review process. ADH Family Health Branch maintains an internal workgroup to provide administrative support for the committee.

In understanding maternal mortality or deaths, several terms exist depending on what and who the term is being used for (i.e., surveillance and reporting, public education, grant applications, etc.). Below are a few common terms and definitions: - Maternal death: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes. - Maternal mortality rate: The number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. - Pregnancy-related mortality ratio: The number of pregnancy-related deaths per 100,000 live births. Scope The scope of cases for Arkansas review is all pregnancy-associated deaths or any deaths of women during pregnancy or up to 365 days after pregnancy ends. In July 2020, committee members set forth exclusion criteria for abstraction (i.e., motor vehicle accidents and out-of-state residents). Deaths are identified from a review of death certificates, based on the cause of death, a pregnancy check box selection, or linkage of vital records by searching death certificates of women of reproductive age and matching them to birth or fetal death certificates in the year of or the year prior to the woman's death. The purpose of the AMMRC is to identify and characterize maternal deaths with the goal of identifying prevention opportunities. To protect and improve the health and well-being of all Arkansans by eliminating preventable maternal deaths in Arkansas. Optimize health for all Arkansans to achieve maximum personal, economic, and social impact. The goals of the AMMRC are to: - Perform thorough record abstraction to obtain details of events and issues leading up to a mother's death. - Perform a multidisciplinary review of cases to gain a holistic understanding of the issues. - Determine the annual number of maternal deaths related to pregnancy (pregnancy-related mortality). - Identify trends and risk factors among pregnancy-related death in Arkansas. - Recommend improvements to care at the individual, provider, and system levels with the potential for reducing or preventing future events. - Prioritize findings and recommendations to guide the development of effective preventive measures. - Recommend actionable strategies for prevention and intervention. - Disseminate the findings and recommendations to a broad array of individuals and organizations. - Promote the translation of findings and recommendations into quality improvement actions at all levels. Quarterly Meetings The AMMRC meets quarterly to review select cases and make recommendations about each case based on the case narrative and abstracted data. These are closed meetings. Members of the public or press will not be allowed at AMMRC meetings. If members of the public or press show up uninvited at a meeting, they will be notified that the AMMRC meetings are not open to the public and will be asked to leave. Members of the public or press will be offered the opportunity to engage with ADH staff about the work at a separate time outside of the AMMRC meetings. The committee examines the cause of death and contributing factors. This multidisciplinary group assembled for the first official meeting in January 2020.

The Arkansas Department of Health, on an ongoing basis, provides training and education to its employees to enhance their skills and knowledge. Utilizing the results of the 2017 Association of State and Territorial Officers Public Health Workforce Interest and Needs Survey as well as a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis by an ADH internal workforce development workgroup, a comprehensive Workforce Development Plan has been developed. The Plan roadmaps the agencies' goals and objectives to maintain a skilled workforce that is prepared to deliver public health essential services and respond to public health emergencies. In addition to these goals and objectives, the Plan also identifies resources, roles, and responsibilities that are required to successfully implement it. Five goals (listed below) and eleven objectives for addressing training and development needs were identified.

During 2019-2020, the Arkansas Department of Health held a five-month-long exercise, involving over 70 people from the Agency and the community partners to identify public health priorities and update the 2016-2019 Strategic Plan. All employees participated in a Planning Survey to provide input on what health outcomes and health behaviors the agency should focus on. With their feedback and by using the 2020 State Health Assessment Report, the planning teams identified eight primary focus areas for the plan. The next step of this exercise was to identify measurable objectives and work plans to operationalize the established goals. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Agency's immediate priorities changed. The leadership decided to develop an interim plan to provide directions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the goals, strategies, objectives, and measures to prevent and control the COVID-19 pandemic were incorporated within the primary focus areas identified by the planning teams. This would help the Agency to make a smooth transition into developing the standard strategic plan after the pandemic is over. The icons below represent the primary focus areas of the 2020-2022 Strategic plan. Please click [here](/images/uploads/pdf/Strategic_Plan.pdf) to access the full 2020-2023 Interim Strategic Plan.

Unlike the report, the Scorecard primarily presents data in graphics and sometimes tabular formats, highlighting multiple-year trends of behaviors, diseases, and deaths. Since the Scorecard does not provide an extensive narrative and the illustrations contain layers of information, tools have been created to assist users.

The Arkansas Board of Examiners for Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology (ABESPA) was created by the Arkansas Legislature to safeguard the public's health, safety, and welfare. ABESPA is responsible for consumer protection through the regulation of speech-language pathology and audiology practice. Individuals who seek the provisions of speech-language pathology and audiology services are entitled to receive quality care. In pursuit of that goal the Board's mission is to assure a process is provided by which consumers may file complaints against licensees or persons practicing speech-language pathology or audiology without a license. Who can/should file a complaint? A complaint should be filed by anyone who believes that an individual has acted illegally, irresponsibly, or unprofessionally in providing care to a client. The most effective complaints are those that contain verifiable, firsthand information. The Board cannot act on anonymous complaints. To that end all complaints must include a signature. What types of complaints does ABESPA handle? - Violations of the Code of Ethics - Violations of the Rules and Regulations - Violation of the Practice Act - Unlicensed Practice What types of complaints are outside of ABESPA's jurisdiction? - Fee or billing disputes - Personal conflicts - Persons not licensed by our Board How do I file a complaint? A complaint must be submitted in writing and signed before it can be processed. Individuals who file complaints are notified in writing of the status of their complaint throughout the process. When submitting a complaint, a statement should be provided in the individuals own words, which explains the nature of their complaint. Provide as much detail as possible as well as any copies of documents, such as patient records, photographs, contracts, correspondence, etc. that can be used as evidence. Original copies should not be provided. Dates, times, and the type of service received should be included when possible. It is not necessary to cite sections of the law that have allegedly been violated. How are complaints processed? Notification of the receipt of the complaint will be mailed to the complainant. While confidential and not public record, the board must disclose information to the licensee regarding the complaint. Licensees who are named in the complaint are given 30 days to respond to any accusations. Complaints are reviewed by board members at the next regularly scheduled meeting. The board may dispose of the complaint informally through correspondence or conference or may forward the complaint to an investigation officer. If forwarded to an investigator, that investigator may contact the complainant during the course of the investigation. Are licensees required to report unprofessional conduct by colleagues? The ABESPA Code of Ethics mandates that the licensee is responsible for reporting alleged misrepresentation or violation of the act or rules to the Board.

APRNs are not issued a license under the NLC. There is specific licensure information that should be reviewed: [What You Need to flyer](https://www.ncsbn.org/2018MilitaryFactsheetFINAL.pdf) [ASBN Educational Opportunities [Arkansas Nursing Education Programs](/images/uploads/pdf/Program_Resources3.2021.pdf) - Click [here](/images/uploads/pdf/EducationPrograms.Military10.2020.pdf)for Arkansas nursing education programs or parent institutions that offer identified services for uniformed service personnel and or veterans.

ASBN - Medication Assistant (Certified) Act 1423 of the 2005 Arkansas legislative session authorized the use of trained and certified medication assistants in nursing homes in Arkansas. In June 2021, the Rules were updated to authorize the use of Medication Assistants-Certified in designated facilities in Arkansas. A designated facility is defined as any Board approved facility to include a nursing home or a facility operated as a local correctional facility as defined by ACA \u00a712-41-107. Medication Assistants are required to successfully complete an education program and pass a certification exam; or complete a portion of a nursing education program equivalent to the MA-C education program and pass a certification exam, before being allowed to function in the role of Medication Assistant-Certified (MA-C) in a designated facility.

Further, the 2015 Arkansas General Assembly passed a law pertaining to the administration of insulin by trained volunteer school personnel to Arkansas public school students who are diagnosed with diabetes. These laws allow trained volunteer school personnel in the absence of the school nurse to administer glucagon, insulin or both to a child diagnosed with diabetes in an emergency situation. Consequently, the Arkansas Department of Education and the Arkansas State Board of Nursing, in collaboration with the Arkansas School Nurses Association and diabetic experts, worked together to identify and approve Insulin and Glucagon Administration Training programs that meet the requirements of the Arkansas State Board of Nursing Rules, Chapter 9.

WELCOME to the Arkansas Department of Health Plan Review page. The mission of the Arkansas Department of Health is to protect and improve the health and well-being of all Arkansans. The plan review process is one important factor in attaining this mission. The purpose of a plan review process is to ensure that development or building projects comply with the adopted policies and codes. Staff review plan submissions for proposed projects. Plan reviews are coordinated through multiple divisions Engineering (Civil projects: drinking water, civil drawings, drinking wells, etc.), Protective Health Codes (Plumbing, Natural Gas), and Environmental (Retail Food, Wholesale/Manufactured food, Public Swimming Pools/Spas). This coordinated process helps to ensure that all pertinent codes/policies are followed in the design and execution of the project. Adhering to the [ADH Guiding Principles](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/images/uploads/pdf/ADHGuidingPrinciples.pdf), the Plan Review staff work diligently to review all projects in a timely manner. While the staff is allotted up to 30 days to complete a review, review times vary depending on numerous factors. To ensure the most efficient process, providing complete submissions referencing the current adopted codes is necessary. For more information contact the appropriate division(s). Plans may now be submitted electronically along with electronic forms and electronic pay capabilities. ADH has also implemented electronic review software, Bluebeam Revu. This is beneficial for submitters who are out of town and out of state thus saving time, gas, and money. ADH Plan Review Divisions: [Protective Health be submitted in person, by mail, or [electronically](https://planreview.adh.arkansas.gov/). Plans may be brought in person by contacting the proper division and setting an appointment for review*. If the submitter is unable to wait for review, plans may be dropped off and staff will review them and send documentation of the review. Plans may also be mailed to the ADH central office in Little Rock. For proper routing, each division has a specific slot number that must be included on the address. *(Please note that appointments or building access may be limited or ceased during the Covid-19 pandemic). Paper Plan submissions are accepted in the same manner they have been in the past. Each submission should consist of complete plans with all pages required for each specific division required, all associated forms/applications/documents, and associated fees. All project submissions require a [Project Cost Estimate](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/images/uploads/pdf/EHP-17_project_cost_estimate_6-29-16.pdf) worksheet and Plan Review fee. Projects that are multiple departments (e.g. Plumbing and Retail food) share 1 form and 1 Plan Review Fee. For this example, Plumbing costs and Food establishment costs are added to get the total project cost. The Plan Review fee is then calculated as 1% of the project cost (minimum $50 and maximum $500). Electronic Plan submissions are submitted through [https://planreview.adh.arkansas.gov/](https://planreview.adh.arkansas.gov/). Those submitting plans electronically are required to create a unique user account. The Project Cost Estimate sheet can be electronically filled out and plans submitted as attachments. Please submit attachments as PDF or CAD files. Photos or .JPEG attachments are allowed but they cannot be utilized in the electronic review process and must be printed out for use/review. Upon submission, staff will issue an invoice for payment. Due to system requirements, payment cannot be made until after 9:00 am the following day. Staff will not review or release any approvals until payment is confirmed. Staff can attach approval letters or other documentation of the review as an attachment to the file or send via email or postal service. Divisional: Retail Food (mobile, kiosk, pushcart, brick & mortar) requires a retail food permit application and an initial annual permit fee at the time of submission.
