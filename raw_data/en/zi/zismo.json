I'm so deeply grateful to be able to receive this gift of her work in my life. Margarita Agata is a very rare and gifted healer who works with a very high frequency. She possesses a very incredible knowledge about vibrational essences and essential oils which she combines with her exquisite intuitive wisdom to create the most amazing bespoke Vibrational Remedies for you. She is very talented in the way that she tunes with you to find out what is needed. I feel that she works at a Soul level and I see her as a Vibrational Alchemist because her formulas are very powerful and can help you to transform and to heal many areas of your life. One of her remedies helped me to shift a very old pattern of resistance and procrastination that was stopping me to keep moving forward with my life.
