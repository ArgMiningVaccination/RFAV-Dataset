Bravo Dean and Gerald L. Bepko Professor of LawAs the fall semester began in August 2021, life at Inlow Hall became more similar to the way we had been accustomed to experiencing it. Students, faculty, and staff all gathered to teach and learn, collaborate, strengthen the school, and reconnect with each other. We did this while observing the requisite safety precautions but celebrated the significance of being all together again. As usual, our first-year students were anticipating their first in-person final exams of their law school careers - that is nothing new. For the upper-level students, however, the return to normal was unusual: imagine being a 2L and taking your first in-person final exam, or a 3L who had not taken a final exam in person in two years. In addition, consider the unpredict - ability of living through an ongoing historic public-health crisis. It is easy to understand why our students, like the rest of our law school community, would feel the effects of stress more so than during a customary final exam period. Our law school staff took action to help combat that stress and to show our students that they were not alone during this time. Our Information T echnology department offered pre-exam help sessions in the Steve T uchman and Reed Bobrick Atrium so that students could ensure that their laptops were up-to-date with the latest necessary exam software. The Office of Academic and Bar Suc- cess offered practical tips through a weekly email to students, including an in-person practice session. The Office of Student Affairs presented \"Fall into Finals, \" also in the Atrium, where students were treated to IU McKinney sweatshirts and other fun items. And the Ruth Lilly Law Library resumed its always popular therapy pet day on the last day of classes before final exams were to begin. Y ou will read about these efforts in this issue of The McKinney Lawyer. Y ou will also read about the remarkable contributions and successes of members of the McKinney commu-nity. McKinney alumni garnered awards for their outstanding work and contributions to the community, and continue to be remarkable examples for our students to emulate. And our graduates are singled-out for their dedication to their chosen practice areas and their work on behalf of their communities. Additionally, you will see stories about students whose pas- sions to make a difference provided the impetus for entering law school. I hope you will enjoy this issue of our alumni magazine and I wish you all the best for the new year. Very truly yours,Dear Alumni and Friends, 9 IU Robert H.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 5 Most McKinney alumni will remember the rhythm of the academic year and the tension that builds as students approach final exams. We all know that the initial experience of law school fi-nals is stressful for 1Ls, but picture being a 2L and taking in-person finals for the first time or being a 3L and taking in-person finals for the first time in two years. Combine that with the uncertainty of living through a public health crisis, and it's safe to say that cur-rent students were a bit on edge at exam time. We're pleased to say that faculty and staff worked together during the fall 2021 semes-ter to plan ways\u2014both practical and light-hearted\u2014for students to return to the classroom and to prepare to take in-person exams for the first, second, or even the last time. The school kicked off the academic year with Wellness Week, August 23-27. Each day had a particular theme focused on various aspects of wellness. The first event was aimed at helping people feel like a part of the law school's community. A large poster fea-turing the school's beloved mascot, McKinney the Legal Beagle, was placed in the atrium for everyone to sign. The school's vibrant student groups were the focus for the second day, highlighted by the Student Organization Fair. This year's fair took place in the courtyard outside Inlow Hall. Positive affirmations were also high-lighted as part of Wellness Week, and the festivities closed with a focus on self-care. IU McKinney's Office of Academic and Bar Success began focus- ing attention on final exams early in the semester. The office emailed students weekly with practical tips on stress management, final exam study strategies, and an in-person practice session for 1Ls. Prior to the Thanksgiving holiday, the Office of Technology Ser- vices set up shop in the atrium over three days to offer students an opportunity to \"Check Your Tech.\" The team offered walk-up help for students to make sure their computer software was up-to-date and ready to run final exam applications. \"This is the greatest number of students who have never taken a law school exam in person, so we wanted to make sure they knew all the steps to take on the day of their exams,\" said Terri Cuellar, assistant dean of technology ser-vices. \"We plan to offer this kind of help moving forward.\"The Office of Student Affairs presented \"Fall into Finals\" on No- vember 18 in the Steve Tuchman and Reed Bobrick Atrium, the same day as the final technology services session. Students were offered IU McKinney sweatshirts and other swag, final exam tips, and a hot chocolate bar. Over 200 students took part in the event. \"It has been a few semesters since all McKinney students had final exams administered in person and OSA wanted to be sure that students were prepared,\" said Associate Director for Student Affairs Julie Davis. \"The event was another way to help build com-munity at the law school as well.\" Therapy pet day in the Ruth Lilly Law Library returned to the law school on November 18, too. It's a perennial favorite for pet lovers and a tradition many students had yet to experience. \"Interacting with the dogs brings a smile to people's faces and helps us take a second to think about something besides school,\" said 2L Taylor Brooks. \"They are so fun!\" Carly Ringlespaugh, also a 2L, agreed. \"Playing with cute pups is always a great break during a stressful week of finishing outlines, pa-pers, and organizing notes,\" Ringlespaugh said. \"I am a dog person, so seeing the dogs so happy to be loved on made me happy, too.\" Kitty Stephens, assistant business manager in the Ruth Lilly Law Library, organizes the event each semester with \"lots of help\" from others on the library staff. Participating in the event were pets from Love on a Leash, the Judges and Lawyers Assistance Program (JLAP), and Pets in Practice. An added bonus this year was a visit from Ruth Lilly Law Library Director Miriam Murphy's cat, Maryle. \"It was a good feeling to bring the therapy pets back to the li- brary,\" Stephens said. \"I can't wait to do it again.\" 6 IU ROBERT H.

State leaders attending the celebration included Gov. Eric J. Holcomb, Bloomington Mayor John Hamilton, and Purdue University President Mitch Daniels. IUPUI and IU's regional campuses watched the ceremony through a livestream broadcast. The inauguration ceremony made history, as Whitten is the first woman to serve in the leadership role at IU. It was also the first time that students from IU's core campuses in Bloom-ington and Indianapolis and all seven regional campuses and centers were represented in the inaugural delegation. In Whitten's inaugural address, she expressed gratitude to women in IU's history who blazed the trail before her: Sarah Parke Morrison, the first female student to be admitted to IU in 1867; Frances Marshall, the first African American woman to graduate from IU; and Nellie Showers Teter, the first woman to serve on the IU Board of Trustees. \"It is a particular honor to be the first woman to serve as president of Indiana University,\" Whitten said. \"I am enor-mously grateful to be able to stand on the shoulders of these and so many other women who helped Indiana University to thrive and flourish.\" Whitten also emphasized the importance of collective support for IU's core missions: providing broad access to an education for all students from Indiana and beyond; pursuing world-class research, scholarship, and creative activity; and making meaningful contributions to im- proving Hoosier health and the economic, social, civic, (OPPOSITE) President Whitten addresses the crowd in the IUPUI campus center at the celebration of her inauguration.

As chair of the Board of Trustees, W. Quinn Buckner officially installed Whitten as the university's president during the ceremony. \"It takes a remarkable individual to lead a remarkable institution,\" Buckner said. \"The Board of Trustees has found that individual in Pamela Whitten. Her scholarly pursuits and her highly distinguished record of leadership have prepared her for this moment.\" Whitten held a variety of leadership roles before joining IU, including president of Kennesaw State University, dean of Michi- gan State University, and senior vice presi-dent for academic affairs and provost at the University of Georgia. She is also an inter-nationally recognized expert in the field of telemedicine. On Friday, November 5, a celebration in President Whitten's honor took place at the Campus Center at IUPUI. The day featured remarks from Chancellor Nasser Paydar and President Whitten, along with appearances by the IUPUI cheerleaders, and Jagathon performers. Festivities in-cluded free food, t-shirts, live art demon- strations, and the opportunity to \"stuff a Jag,\" among others. On Wednesday, November 10, President Whitten was a guest at a joint board meeting of the IU McKinney Law Alumni Associa-tion and Board of Visitors. She spoke briefly to the board members and addressed ques- tions from the group. Later in the evening, she participated in a program honoring former IU McKinney dean, Andrew R. Klein.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 9 Professor Andrew R. Klein, the Paul E. Beam Professor and for- mer dean of the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, was honored November 10 for his contributions to the law school, the campus, and the university while serving as the school's 12th dean from 2013-2020. Nearly 250 people, including university dignitaries, members of the judiciary, and IU McKinney faculty, staff, and alumni, at-tended the event celebrating Professor Klein, which took place in the Clowes Ballroom at the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis. Following a welcome from IU McKinney Law Dean Karen Bravo, featured speakers included In-diana University President Pamela Whitten and IUPUI Chancel-lor Nasser Paydar. Chancellor Paydar presented Professor Klein with the IUPUI Chancellor's Medallion, a distinction awarded by the chancellor to people of vision, character, high achievement, and distinguished service. The Honorable Susan Brooks, '85, distinguished scholar and ambassador at large at IU McKinney Law and former U.S. Rep-resentative, shared a tribute to Professor Klein on behalf of U.S. Senator Todd Young, '06, that was read into the U.S. Congressio-nal Record on November 4, 2021. Cynthia Carrasco, '06, deputy general counsel for the State of Indiana, presented Professor Klein with the designation of Saga-more of the Wabash on behalf of Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb, and Judith Thomas, deputy mayor of neighborhood engagement of the City of Indianapolis, read a proclamation on behalf of Mayor Joe Hogsett, declaring November 10, 2021, as \"Andrew R. Klein Day\" in the city. The presentations were followed by Professor Florence Wag- man Roisman, the William F. Harvey Professor of Law and Chancellor's Professor, who made remarks on behalf of the IU McKinney faculty. \"It is a great honor for me to speak on behalf of the IU McKin- ney faculty about my dear friend, cherished colleague, and former dean, Andy Klein,\" said Professor Roisman. \"I've known Andy since he first came to McKinney as a visiting professor and we then had the good sense to ask him to join us as a tenured member of the faculty. I benefitted from his service to us as a colleague, as associate or vice dean, and then as dean. As an administrator, he's led us through times that were extraordinarily challenging, emo - tionally and financially; as a colleague\u2014a servant/leader\u2014he has provided wisdom and sensitivity to help us resolve many difficult problems,\" she added. Professor Roisman then explained that she asked faculty and staff to submit words to her that describe Andy, which she termed \"Adjectives for Andy,\" and provided them to him in a gift package, Law School Honors Former Dean Andrew Klein Professor Andy Klein received the IUPUI Chancellor's Medallion, a distinction awarded by the chancellor to people of vision, character, high achievement, and distinguished service.10 IU ROBERT H.

Adam Arceneaux, '93, chair of the IU McKinney Law Board of Visitors, offered congratulations and praise from the board, and Danica Hostettler, '03, president of the IU McKinney Law Alumni Association, rounded out the program by presenting Professor Klein with an IU McKinney Honorary Alumnus Award. Klein joined the McKinney Law faculty in 2000 and served as as- sociate dean for academic affairs from 2004 to 2007. In 2007, he was a visiting fellow at Clare Hall and a visiting scholar on the Faculty of Law at the University of Cambridge. From 2010 to 2013, Klein served as chief of staff in the Office of the Chancellor and associate vice chancellor for academic affairs at IUPUI. A dedicated classroom instructor, Klein's teaching and research focus on tort and environmental law have garnered numerous awards, including five teaching awards, three faculty leadership awards, two outstanding administrator awards, and the Indiana University Trustees Teaching Award. He is a past recipient of the Black Cane Award presented by the McKinney student body for out-standing professor, and in 2019, he was honored with an IU Bicen - tennial Medal in recognition of his distinguished service as dean. An active scholar, Klein has published articles in a number of lead- ing law journals and has co-authored two casebooks and a student-oriented textbook. He is a member of the American Law Institute and has served as reporter for the Seventh Circuit United States Court of Appeals Civil Jury Instructions Committee. He is a Distin-guished Fellow of the Indianapolis and Indiana Bar Foundations. Prior to joining IU, Klein was on the faculty of Samford Univer- sity's Cumberland School of Law from 1992 to 2000. He earned his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Wisconsin and his Juris Doc-tor with Distinction from Emory University School of Law where he studied as a Robert W. Woodruff Fellow in Law and was editor-in-chief of the Emory Law Journal. Following law school, Professor Klein served for one year as a law clerk to Judge Joseph W. Hatchett of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The stock advice, \"Find your passion, \" can take people any number of di- rections, including to law school. But there's growing evidence that it's not unusual for IU McKinney School of Law students to seek a law degree to fuel\u2014not just find\u2014their passions. In 2021, law schools across the country saw a spike in applicants, the larg - est increase in applications in over a decade, and perhaps that's not surpris-ing, given the world events that have unfolded over the past few years, says Julie Smith, Assistant Dean of Enrollment Management. A global pandemic exposed inequity across underrepresented groups within the healthcare system and a lack of coordination between levels of government to handle a public health crisis. Americans experienced a heat - ed political climate and an especially tense election year. For many, there has been an awakening\u2014or re-awakening\u2014to racism and its implications for the American justice system. As a result, people see that a legal education is a way to work toward solv - ing societal problems, Smith says. \"In reading the personal statements of our 2021 applicants there seemed to be much more of a focus on making a difference toward creating a more equitable society, \" Smith says. \"More applicants state they 'just want to make a difference, ' citing interest areas in civil and human rights law, health law, public policy, and politics. \"It's encouraging to see this generation seek out positive ways to create change and to recognize that a law degree is one tool to do so, \" she says. Looking for a dose of idealism? Meet some current IU McKinney students who are passionate about a cause\u2014and hope to use their law degrees to make a difference. Degrees of Passion IU McKinney Students Come to Law School Committed to Causes By Alicia Dean Carlson and Rebecca Trimpe 1L Farrah Alexander: \"I am not a person to be silenced\" Mothers are a force to be reckoned with\u2014and 1L Farrah Alexander is in law school to prove it. Alexander was a self-described \"mommy blogger\" who was already widely published when a cascade of events unfolded, including the 2020 shooting death of Breonna T aylor by police in Louisville, Kentucky, near where she lives with her husband and two children. Alexander brought that perspective as author of two books, Raising the Resis-tance: A Mother's Guide to Practical Activism (2020) and the upcom-ing Resistance in the Bluegrass: Empowering the Commonwealth (University of Kentucky Press). \"I became more politically active, and as I became more involved in political activism, the more I saw how lawyers play an important role in making positive change, \" she says. \"I wanted to be part of that. I couldn't imagine a more direct and positive way to make a change than through studying the law. \" T ough subjects are not a problem for Alexander, who has reacted strongly\u2014in print\u2014to issues such as maternal health, for which she won the inaugural IndyBar Health Care & Life Sciences Section Law Student Writing/Oral Competition, and antisemitism, especially in progressive circles, and an op-ed for the Courier Journal. \"I find it very disturbing, and I am not a person to be silenced, \" she says. IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 13 M.J.-Ph.D. in Urban Studies Ronald Cunningham \"commit to work that was relevant and would have an impact\" After completing his undergraduate studies, Ronald Cunningham was working as a paralegal at a prestigious Washington, D.C., law firm. He describes his life at that time as comfortable. Then a friend reminded him of his \"lifelong aspirations to not only strive to be successful but in doing that commit to work that was relevant and would have an impact on disenfranchised people, \" Cunningham said. \"That conversation prompted me to make an immediate shift into K-12 education and despite some challenges along the way, I haven't looked back. \" Cunningham worked for 23 years as a K-12 educator in schools in Washington, D.C.; Atlanta, Georgia; New Orleans, Louisiana; Cleveland, Ohio; Oakland, California; and in Indianapolis. He graduated from George-town University and completed his graduate studies at Howard Univer - sity. Cunningham is the director of instruction for Tindley Schools. In ad-dition, he teaches undergraduate students in the School of Education's teacher training program. Prior to his work at IUPUI, Cunningham was a guest instructor for two summers at Dillard University, and one summer at Georgetown. \"I have always been interested in policy and law as it relates to educa- tion, \" Cunningham said. He was introduced to Critical Race Theory in his doctoral program, and that serves as the theoretical framework for his primary graduate research. \"As I desired to strengthen my critical lens, I concluded my writing and research would be more refined if I deepened my understanding of both along with an understanding of educational policy and law. \" That's the reason he enrolled in IU McKinney's M.J. program. Cunningham has what he terms \"a healthy obsession\" with programs that purport to revolutionize urban education. \"T each For All, T each for America, The Relay Graduate School, KIPP Schools and other white neoliberal educational organizations assert a commitment to revolutionizing urban education while authoring a system of educating students of color that is as racially hostile as the system they profess a desire to dismantle, \" Cunningham said. \"My graduate work aims to interrogate different aspects of this practice. \" His goal is to become a professor at a university where he can continue to work with pre-service teachers yet play a more impactful role in shaping what their preparation looks like. 14 IU ROBERT H.

Nineteen-year-old Molley was a recent high school graduate when she was murdered in a double homicide in Porter County, Indiana. The founda- tion is one of Lanham's passion projects, and so is the goal of becoming a lawyer and advocate for others. After graduating from IU Bloomington with a journalism degree, she worked in the hospitality industry while sorting out her future. \"I had always thought about attending law school, but I wanted to make sure I had a real passion for it, \" Lanham says. \"When this situation occurred and we began to interact with the criminal justice system, every single lawyer we met with was filled with compassion for us and what we were going through. That compas-sion we experienced convinced me that I wanted to be an advocate for families going through similar situations. It's so personal, but it it's also my passion. \" While the public is aware of the uptick in gun violence in Indiana, families of victims of homicide are too often left alone to grieve\u2014or, worse, made to feel shame for the way their loved one died, she says. The foundation\u2014and law school\u2014help her focus on helping others, something her sister would want. \"The worst thing in the world can happen to you, but you will still have good days, \" Lanham says. \"Y ou can take control of your life and turn your loss into something positive. \" LL.M. Arthur Morris: \"I want to help\" The lockdown period during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic gave a lot of people time to think and Arthur Morris was no different. \"I decided I want to help somehow, \" Morris said. \"That's what I really wanted to do. \" That ambition led Morris to enroll in IU McKinney's Master of Laws program; he's studying the Corporate and Commercial Law track. And he joined the U.S. Army Reserve where he is a Specialist and participates in drills at Camp Atterbury. \"I strongly believe people should give something of themselves and serve, \" Morris said. \"I've always liked the Army and I wanted to give public service. \" He hopes to become part of the Judge Advocate General Corps after he completes his legal studies. Through his role in the Reserves, Morris was able to help the Afghan refu- gees who were brought here after the T aliban swept across the country in August 2021. Many refugees don't have the documents they need to resettle in the United States. \"Hopefully we can get them out of legal purgatory soon, \" Morris said of the evacuees. \"It's tough, but we'll get through it. \" Morris's parents are missionaries in India; his father is from the United States and his mother is from India. Morris went to high school in India, where he also received his law degree and a bachelor's degree in business. After completing his military service, Morris wants to tackle labor contracts that make it more difficult for workers to lobby for better working conditions and compensation. \"My goal with the LL.M. is to understand corporate and commercial structures more fully so I can help out the people at the front line, the lower-level workers, \" Morris said. \"A lot of this has to be done organically. The tools are there to create more organic gains for labor. I want to focus on it. \" IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 15 In Warren T ownship Small Claims Court, it's difficult to tell the IU McKinney law students from members of the bar. T enants arrive for a hearing on their eviction proceeding and file into the waiting area. Many walk by the sign posted by Indiana Legal Services that advertises free, immediate legal help. The ones who ask to speak with a lawyer are assigned one. Seven IU McKinney Health and Human Rights Clinic students, all of whom are Indiana Supreme Court certified legal interns, introduce themselves and set to work gathering information from the clients they've just met. The hear - ings will take place moments after this initial interview. The students are pro-fessional, calm, assured, and in control. T enants often bring information about their cases: checks to prove rent payment, emailed receipts, and other details. In addition to gleaning all the relevant facts they can, law students also counsel clients on available resources to cover back rent. The stakes are high for the defendants: losing their homes, perhaps with a history of having been evicted making it markedly more difficult to find another. The overwhelming majority of people in these circumstances enter Small Claims Court without an attorney by their side. If they can't make the rent, they can't afford to hire a lawyer. \"It's a little bit like the equivalent of firefighters running into the burning building because they have the tools and training to help where it is most needed. We can help people facing a legal action that is potentially going to remove them from the home, \" said Professor Fran Quigley, '87 . He teaches in the Health and Human Rights Clinic, and he and his students are cur - rently focusing on the eviction crisis. The clinic began this work remotely in spring 2021 and continued it through the summer and into the fall se-mester. \"It feels like the housing crisis now, if it's not THE justice issue of our time, it's in that category. \" Indiana Legal Services (ILS) also provides on-the-spot pro bono legal counsel to tenants facing eviction hearings. Brandon Beeler, '08, is ILS's Housing Law Center director, where he sets policy for the organization's approach to the crisis statewide. Professor Quigley and his students work alongside ILS attorneys with tenants facing eviction. \"What we need the most is people power, \" Beeler said. \"The courts have never been this busy. Small Claims courts are like cattle calls. Our goal is to reach the tenants and provide as much help as we can without delaying the court's calendar. The process is already confusing enough. It's just so helpful to have someone review a case, someone who can identify issues and help a tenant with a defense he or she may have. \"Judge Garland Graves presides in Warren T ownship Small Claims Court in Marion County. He's been known to send a tenant in his court back to the waiting area to meet with a pro bono attorney or clinic students, and he frequently counsels parties on the resources available as he's hearing cases. \"The law students and Professor Quigley give a voice and legal argu- ments for self-represented litigants, \" Judge Graves said. \"The self-repre-sented litigants are more prepared to advocate for themselves after re-ceiving advice from Professor Quigley and the law students. The students that represent tenants in court, with Professor Quigley's supervision, do a good job formulating legal arguments and presenting their cases. \" The combination of working in Judge Graves' courtroom with Indiana Legal Services attorneys has been invaluable, Professor Quigley said. \"It's been so important to me to have the student's first litigation experience be in front of a judge who is dedicated to making sure everyone in his courtroom is treated with respect and compassion, \" Professor Quigley said, \"no matter whether they are rich or poor, whether they are an attorney or a struggling ten-ant. We are grateful for that. And every time we've been in court, Indiana Legal Services attorneys who are experienced in this kind of work have been alongside us and have been an invaluable source of support and guidance. \" IU McKinney 3L Allyson Crane enrolled in the Health and Human Rights Clinic class because of her interest in health law, and the interest in hous-ing she developed after taking Professor Florence Wagman Roisman's Health, Housing, and the Law course. \"This experience is something that I will carry with me for the remainder of my career and life, \" Crane said. \"It's been great getting hands-on experi-ence and developing relationships with my clients and fighting for tenants' access to safe and secure housing has been so rewarding. This clinic has made me aware of the flaws in Indiana's housing system and what we can do as law students and attorneys to fix it. \" Courtney Oliver also is a 3L in Professor Quigley's clinic class. \"It has been stressful working with the clients because they are in crisis by the time we meet them, \" she said. \"It has been rewarding working with them because they are always so extremely grateful for our help. \" T aylor Webster, another 3L in the clinic class, acknowledges the work has been emotional and fulfilling at the same time. \"We are seeing people going through some of the most difficult times of their lives, \" she said. \"It has been rewarding to obtain a positive outcome for a client who otherwise may not have had a chance to stay in their home, get more time to prepare before moving out, or just simply avoid an eviction altogether. I am grateful that we Health and Human Rights Clinic Faculty and Students Face Eviction Crisis Head-On By Rebecca Trimpe 16 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINEhave been able to leverage the privilege of our le- gal education to help improve our communities and make a difference, even if it is just for a few people. This work is so important and my hope is that more students like us will go through this clinic and be inspired to do this work. \" The students' work hasn't been limited to the classroom and the courtroom. Crane created a video to walk tenants through how to apply for rent assistance through IndyRents, as the appli-cation can be confusing, and the students togeth-er presented a \"Know Y our Rights as a T enant\" program to a community group. Students also are filing motions to seal tenants' records so fu-ture prospective landlords won't see an eviction. The law students' work in Small Claims Court on behalf of those facing eviction is an ideal clinic experience in a lot of ways, Profes-sor Quigley said. Students get to work one-on-one with a client, have ex - perience working in a courtroom, and get to draft the proper legal docu-ments. Students have ownership of a case from start to finish. The downside to clinic students working on eviction cases is significant. \"They are so incredibly intense, \" Professor Quigley said of these eviction cases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control eviction moratorium ended as school was starting in August 2021. \"I worried as the semester went on that I had asked too much of the students. But I've been blown away by their response. They help their clients with navigating social services, finding a new place to live, references, and challenges with new landlord applications. They've provided emotional support to families who are facing one of the worst moments of their lives. I couldn't be more proud of them. \" IU McKinney students in Professor Quigley's fall 2021 Health and Human Rights Clinic class are Cassidy Hendrickson, Marcel Ngachie, Courtney Oli- ver, Avery Penn, Emily T yner, T aylor Webster, and Katie Whitley.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 17 Vice Dean Cynthia Adams, '83, and Mark Shope, '12, collaborated on a virtual international negotiation simulation experience as a course for students at IU McKinney and National Y ang Ming Chiao T ung University School of Law (NYCU) in T aiwan, where Shope is an Assistant Professor of Law. The pair received a grant in February 2021 from the IUPUI Office of International Affairs Virtual Exchange Fellows program and were part of the inaugural cohort. IU McKinney and NYCU recently entered into a memorandum of intent to explore various avenues for collaborative activities. \"Professor Shope and I collaborating on this simulation experi-ence was an ideal opportunity to kick off this new and exciting relationship between our schools, \" Vice Dean Adams said. Vice Dean Adams and her class met with Professor Shope and his students synchro-nously every Friday through Zoom during the fall 2021 semester. Students worked through a simulated negotiation exercise in which IU McKinney students represented \"IndyT ech Corporation\" and the NYCU team represent - ed \"Hsinchu Semiconductor Corporation. \" The two companies worked together to ex - ploit a newly discovered element that could increase the speed of semiconductors. \"I've taught a negotiations course for sev - eral years, which includes an ongoing nego-tiation simulation of a complex domestic busi-ness deal, \" said Vice Dean Adams. \"Still, my dream has always been to teach the course in an international exchange setting. We work in a global business community. This course is an ideal vehicle for students to hone their skills in interest-based negotiation, which promotes collaboration, works to increase the 'value pie, ' and strives to achieve a 'win-win' outcome for all parties. The 'interest-based' negotiation skills taught in this course are sorely needed in today's complex world. Students complet - ing this negotiation course understand that the essential concepts and critical skills of 'interest-based' negotiation are effective and can be applied beyond the business setting. \"The course required students to navigate a variety of potential barriers in- cluding language, culture, and time zone, among others. \"It was a challenge, but it was such a unique experience that I'll never forget it, \" said 3L Nicole Salwowski. \"There were some communication barriers, but we worked hard as a team to clarify any miscommunications and ultimately reached a great deal for both parties. \" For example, after using the term \"iron out\" and con-fusing their T aiwan counterparts, IU McKinney students worked hard to edit out uniquely American colloquialisms from their language. The best part of the class for Salwowski was the hands-on experi- ence she gained. \"I genuinely feel like I par - ticipated in a team negotiation for my client, \" Salwowski said. \"We had to work as a team, but we also had to work with students across the globe and try to reach an agreement. This is so unique, and yes challenging, but I grew so much as an attorney and negotiator. I can't emphasize enough how much I learned though this class dynamic. \" Crafting a deal in which both parties get what they want made the class realistic, said 3L Kon-stantina Kloufetos. \"By harnessing a mutual interests approach, we were able to understand the other's objectives through the language and location barriers, and reach an agreement that would benefit both sides in the negotia- IU McKinney Offers Course in International Negotiations by Rebecca Trimpe 18 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINEJoshua Marsh, '19, is the youngest mayor in the state of Indiana, and his goals for Greensburg, Indiana, reflect a focus on the future. Marsh grew up on a family farm in Greensburg, which sits right off I-74, half - way between Indianapolis and Cincinnati. The county seat of Decatur County, Greensburg long ago adopted the moniker \"T ree City\" for its famous Courthouse T ower tree. He was elected mayor in 2019 at age 26, promising to focus on quality of life and economic opportunity, and cultivating an environment that can attract young professionals. It's that last goal that has put Greensburg in the spotlight, recently grabbing national headlines on NPR, People and ABC News for creative incentives such as Grandparents on Demand for newcomers to move to the town of approximately 13,000 citizens Marsh, a Republican, says he came back to his hometown to work on behalf of the community. \"My focus is on quality of life in Greensburg, \" he says. \"We need to continue to focus on a diversification of employment and look at ways to allow our high school graduates and young people to stay in the community and thrive. We are working to position Greensburg for the future as a safe community with great schools and within an hour's drive to Indianapolis and Cincinnati, so people can enjoy a more rural environment that is convenient to those two des-tination cities. \" He is a graduate of Greensburg High School and Ball State University, where he earned a degree in public relations. While attending law school, he worked for the state of Indiana and its communication efforts that focused on health and wellness initiatives. He also served as the Attorney General's Drug Abuse T ask Force Coordinator where he worked with healthcare, mental health, non-profit, and law enforcement organizations from across Indiana. At IU McKinney, Marsh was a member of the Federalist Society and took away lessons in leadership in a course taught by former law school deans Andrew R. Klein and Gerald L. Bepko. Law school, he says, taught him valuable problem-solving skills and the ability to read and digest legal documents\u2014something he's doing on a regular basis in the mayor's office. Marsh says he's energized to run for re-election in 2023. \"We have more work to do in Greensburg than time to do it, \" he says.

It is so important to remember that we often have the same goals and objectives, but our differences interfere with our ability to communicate those connection-based objectives. This class showed me that we can all find ways to reach agreement and generate economic value for our society if we take the time to insightfully understand the other side's perspective. We must get creative to handle communication barriers, and most importantly, we must listen to reach agreement. \" The class had a lecture component so students were learning legal theory behind negotiations in addition to the practical portion where they gained real experience at a cross-cultural negotiation. \"Through the negotiation, students were able to experience negotiation between different cultures, in different time zones, and utilizing different nego-tiation styles, \" Professor Shope said. \"The negotia-tion was in English, but one side's native language wasn't English, so both sides had to navigate this issue in a productive way. As a former full-time practicing attorney, I can say that all of this is ex - actly what students will see in the real world. \" Professor Shope, who also teaches at IU McKinney as a visiting online instructor, worked at Faegre Drink - er Biddle & Reath until 2018, when he and his wife de-cided to move back to T aiwan. He'd always wanted to work in academia so when an opportunity to teach at NYCU came his way, he jumped on it. \"My dean encourages our faculty to maintain connections with our various alma maters, so look out for more proj- ects with McKinney in the future!\" Shope said.

Stradford during an online event on September 10, which was Mr. Stradford's birthday. He was a prominent business leader in T ulsa, Oklahoma's thriv - ing Black community at the time of the 1921 race massacre in that city. Stradford, a graduate of the Indianapolis College of Law, one of IU McKinney's predecessor schools, practiced law in Indiana before moving to Oklahoma and becoming a successful en-trepreneur, as well as a human rights proponent. An article about Stradford by Judge David Shaheed, '84, appears in the Summer 2021 edition of The McKinney Lawyer Alumni Magazine. Intrigued by an account of Stradford's life that indicated he attended law school in Indianapolis around the turn of the century, Judge Shaheed sought more information. The Ruth Lilly Law Library and IUPUI archives were able to help confirm that Stradford graduated from a predecessor school of IU McKinney at the turn of the century. The ongoing research, along with the 100-year anniversary of the race massacre in T ulsa taking place in 2021, led to a project to honor Stradford, spearheaded by Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion Patricia Kinney, '02. Nicole Burts, '17 , joined the effort, conducting more research into Stradford's history and writing about it. Speakers at the event included Chancellor Nasser Paydar, Vice Dean Mike Pitts, Judge Sha- heed; Nicole Calloway, grandson of J.B. Stradford; and law student Richard Okello. The program culminated with the unveiling of a portrait of J.B. Stradford that the law school commissioned from Indianapolis artist Jay Parnell. The portrait can now be found on the sec-ond floor in Inlow Hall. Judge Shaheed and Burts took part in the WFYI radio show All IN on August 31 to share infor - mation about Stradford and promote the September event.

IU McKinney students had the opportunity to meet with federal judges and law clerks during an event at Inlow Hall on November 9. The visit was designed to inform students about the benefits of federal clerkships. Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson, '83, who ini- tiated the meeting, chairs the Diversity and Inclusion Committee for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. \"One area of growth and improvement for us was to improve the diversity of our law clerks, \" Judge Magnus-Stinson said. The goal was to do an information session about clerkships for traditionally underrepre-sented students. The court initially reached out to the Black Law Students Association regarding the meeting. BLSA leadership and the court then agreed to open the event to students from the Asian Law Students Association, Hispanic Law Society, Lambda Law Society, and Wom-en's Caucus. Students suggested a round-robin or speed dating format to ensure stu- dents got to talk to as many representatives from the court as possible. Judge Magnus-Stinson recruited judges and law clerks, many of whom were IU McKinney alumni, to take part in the event. \"It's an unparalleled qualification, \" Judge Mangun-Stinson said of having a federal clerkship on one's resume. Of the people appearing before the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee for confirmation to a high-level federal government post, a high percentage of them have been federal law clerks. The goal is to make the federal clerkship discussion an annual event at IU McKinney. \"The main thing is the court reached some students who might not have known about these positions and encouraged them to con-sider applying, \" Judge Magnus-Stinson said. \"I think it was a good experience. \" Shown here with the students are Judge Doris Pryor (first row, far right); Staff Attorney Roxana Bell, '11, (second row, third from right); Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson, '83, (second row, second from right); and Magistrate Judge Mario Garcia, '99, (second row, far right).

Federal Court Representatives Visit IU McKinney Students to Discuss Clerkship Opportunities Professor Gerard Magliocca discussed his book in progress on the life of Bushrod Washington during an event to celebrate Constitution Day. The lecture took place on September 14 in the Wynne Courtroom at Inlow Hall. Profes-sor Magliocca's lecture is available for online viewing on the school's website. Bushrod Washington, nephew of George Washington, served on the United States Supreme Court from 1798 to 1829 and had a close personal and professional relationship with Chief Justice John Marshall. He also served in the Continental Army near the end of the American Revolution. Professor Magliocca conducted research for his book, Washington's Heir: The Life of Justice Bushrod Washing - ton, while a member of the 2019-2020 class of fellows for the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon. The book is expected to be published in Fall 2022. Professor Magliocca is a Samuel R. Rosen Professor of Law at IU McKinney. He is the author of four books, the latest of which, The Heart of the Constitution: How the Bill of Rights Became the Bill of Rights, was published by Oxford University Press in 2018. He also is the author of over 20 articles on constitutional law and intellectual property.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINEJoseph P . Allen, executive director of the Bayh-Dole Coalition, presented the 2021 Birch Bayh Lecture, Reversing the Tide: the Bayh-Dole Act and the Renewal of American Innovation, in a virtual format on October 19. Allen discussed how the Bayh-Dole Act was created, the incredible story of its enactment in 1980, and its impact here and throughout the world. Before Bayh-Dole, federal funding was the kiss of death to commercializing breakthrough in-ventions. Government policy was to take inventions which received even a small percentage of their support, making them avail-able to any and all. While well meaning, this policy removed any incentives for creators to under - take the extensive and time-consuming process needed to turn early-stage discoveries into useful products. As a result, more than 28,000 govern-ment-supported inventions were gathering dust on the shelves before Bayh-Dole. Because of the efforts of the late Senators Birch Bayh and Robert Dole, this practice came to an end, renewing America's leadership in innovation. Even though they were from opposite ends of the political spectrum, Bayh and Dole worked closely together to overcome incredible odds to get their legislation enacted, thus changing the course of history. This year's Bayh Lecturer, Joseph P . Allen, served on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for Senator Bayh, helping to secure passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, which fostered research and development partnerships between universities and U.S. industry. After that, he became execu-tive director of Intellectual Property Owners, Inc., where he worked to create the Court of the Federal Circuit before going to the U.S. Department of Commerce where he became the director of the Office of T echnology Commercialization. He was instrumental in the passage of major laws allowing U.S. industry to perform joint research and develop-ment with federal laboratories. Allen's office oversaw executive branch implementa-tion of the Bayh-Dole and Federal T echnology T ransfer Acts and related presidential policy directives. He also served as president of the National T echnology T ransfer Center established by Congress to promote industry/federal laboratory research and development partnerships. In 2008 he founded Allen and Associates a consult - ing firm specializing in technology management/IP issues. The Birch Bayh Lecture was established at the school in honor of the late U.S. Senator Birch Bayh. The lecture series focuses on issues of importance to Sena-tor Bayh throughout his long and distinguished career in government and is made possible through the generous contributions of Simon Property group, where Sen- ator Bayh served on the board for 17 years, and friends of Birch Bayh.

Baise know the lifechanging power of education. Both first-generation college graduates, they've been providing philanthropic support of higher educa-tion\u2014including IU McKinney School of Law\u2014for more than 30 years. Gary grew up on a farm outside of Jacksonville, Illinois, deeply affected by stories of Abraham Lincoln as a young lawyer in the state. \"I always wanted to be a lawyer be-cause I wanted to help people. As I was growing up, I saw people mistreated, people who probably never even thought of hiring a lawyer. I thought I could do some good,\" he says. After graduating from Western Illinois University in 1963, Gary headed off to law school in Bloomington, but a scholarship from the Ford Foundation to work with the Indiana General Assembly brought him to Indianapolis, where he completed his law degree. Since then, Gary has spent more than 50 years in government and private legal practice, currently serving as co-chairman of the litigation practice at Ols-son Frank Weeda Terman Matz, P.C. in Washington, D.C. That career has included several brush - es with history. He served in the Depart-ment of Justice with U.S. Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus, who was a fishing companion on October 20, 1973, when Ruckelshaus became a casualty of the so-called Saturday Night Massacre, resigning rather than following President Nixon's instructions to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. He was the first chief of staff to the first U.S. Environmental Pro- tection Agency (EPA) Administrator and subsequently became di-rector of the EPA's Office of Legislation. He also served as executive assistant to the acting director of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-tion, associate deputy attorney general, and acting deputy attorney general in the U.S. Department of Justice. Today, Gary specializes in environmental and agricultural law and regulations and corporate governance issues and serves as outside general counsel for several national agriculture organi-zations. He organized President Trump's agricultural team of advisers, and is a blogger for a weekly column, Defending Agriculture, which is read internationally in Farm Futures. Ann earned her bachelor's degree in El- ementary Education from Longwood Col-lege in 1974 and master's degree in Edu - cation from Virginia Tech in 1978. She served on the Board of Visitors of Long-wood University, serving three times as rector of the board. She also served on the Board of Visitors of the College of William and Mary for four years and was named an honorary alumni in 2017. Farming and agriculture are a shared passion\u2014Ann runs their numerous farms in three states\u2014and their stature in ag circles has even taken them to Bucking-ham Palace, where they discussed farm-ing practices with Princess Anne, which was \"pretty interesting for a Midwestern boy and a girl from Virginia,\" Gary says. In 2018, they established the Gary H. and Ann G. Baise Scholarship, an award for J.D. students at IU McKinney Law who have financial need and possess the potential to succeed as demonstrated by their academic credentials. \"In addition to the financial support, scholarships can instill con- fidence in students and show them that others believe in them and see things that they don't yet see in themselves,\" Gary says. \"That's why we give the way we do\u2014to help others.\" Baise Scholarship Designed by Donors to Help Students Succeed IU ROBERT H.

She was headed to a photo opportunity with IU students and invited Miller along. After all, he's an enrolled student at IU. The moment, cap- tured in the photo (at left), shows Miller posing with Whitten. Fifty-four years after Miller took Introduction to Philosophy as an undergraduate, he's back in the same Woodburn Hall classroom where he took the course for the first time. Plato is still on the syllabus.So why take it again? \"I love to learn,\" he says. \"I love reading. I love to be in class. College students are fun.\" Miller earned his bachelor's degree in political science at IU in 1971. He received his J.D., summa cum laude, from the IU Robert H. McKin- ney School of Law in 1977. In his legal career, Miller focused on employment and labor law and retired in 2012 from Faegre Baker Daniels. During his career, he was recognized in the Indiana Super Lawyers magazine and as one of the best lawyers in America for more than 10 consecutive years. He recently created the David W.

Miller became acquainted with Wabash through his son, Adam, who graduated from the small, men-only liberal arts college in 2005. While Adam was a Wabash student and member of the Wabash wrestling team, his father became involved as well, mentoring student-athletes and inspiring others to do the same. \"I enjoy working with undergrads, and I enjoyed working with the law clerks when I was practicing law,\" Miller says. \"It is very satisfying to help young people figure out their lives and careers.\" As enthusiastic as he is about life- long learning and mentoring, Miller is equally passionate about philan-thropy. He gives back to each of the institutions that helped shape his three children into successful adults, as well as the institution that shaped his own career. The years of tuition he's paid are \"just a down payment on what I owe.\" \"The law school, and faculty like Ed Archer, Larry Jegen, Bruce Townsend, Hal Woodard, Kent Frandsen and others, equipped me with an education that allowed me to compete for a very rewarding career. The benefits of that education were life changing to myself and my family,\" Miller says. \"Colleges and law schools create opportunities,\" he says. \"You have to say thank you for those opportunities. And saying thanks isn't enough. You must do something about it.\" IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 27 28 IU ROBERT H.

Led by Clinical Professor of Law Cynthia A. Baker, who directs the IU McKinney Program on Law and State Government, PLSG Fellows Chaka Coleman and Katie Whitley helped plan the symposium, presented re- search, and spoke from personal experiences. Speakers\u2014both virtual and live in the Wynne Courtroom\u2014includ - ed Joseph Blocher of the Center of Firearms Law at Duke Law School and Mike McLively of the Giffords Law Center. A panel dis- cussion on \"The Jake Laird Law: Efficacy and Adjudication of Red Flag Laws\" featured the Honor - able Susan Brooks, IU McKin- ney adjunct professor of law; Lt. Brad Hoffeditz, Indiana State Police legal counsel and legisla- tive director; the Honorable Amy Jones, Marion Superior Court, and attorney Guy Relford, '83. The symposium also included \"Investigating Gun Violence, Trauma, and the Effectiveness of Hospital-Based Violence Inter-vention Programs\" with Dr. Joseph B. Richardson, Jr., Profes- sor, University of College Park and the University of Maryland, Baltimore, School of Medicine, as well as a book discussion with John Woodrow Cox, Washington Post staff writer and author of the book Children Under Fire: An American Crisis. Coleman, whose topic was \"Gun Rights and Gun Violence: Can Data Disrupt the Status Quo?\" was first introduced to the justice system while working as a bailiff in the Marion County courts, where the impact of gun violence is seen almost daily. She also grew up around sportsmen who enjoyed hunting and firearms as part of rural life. She used her fellowship year to focus on the relationship be- tween data collection and gun violence, and how a response can still protect Second Amendment rights. \"For me, the data is so important,\" Coleman said. \"You can't solve a problem unless you understand the core issues. Our re-search and the symposium addressed issues\u2014gun rights and gun violence\u2014that are often talked about, not really addressed at the molecular level.\" For PLSG Fellow Whitley, the topic of gun violence is personal. A former middle school science teacher in Indianapolis, Whitley has attended funerals for students who once sat in her classroom. She can count 11 former students who have died because of gun vio- lence. She presented her topic, \"Gun Violence, Community Trauma, and the Law,\" with a sense of ur- gency, she said. \"Some states have been able to implement some reforms and have helped communities address violence through intervention pro- grams,\" she said. \"Indiana can take steps to make a difference for cities like Indianapolis that have unac- ceptable rates of gun violence.\" \"This year's PLSG Fellowship Symposium celebrated all that we've learned about how to engage with technology and the progress we've made against the current pandemic,\" Professor Baker said. \"It comprised a webinar in the morning, a traditional, in-person event in the law school's courtroom in the afternoon, and a social hour on our law school's patio on a beautiful fall day. It was mar- velous to see so many of the terrific network of lawyers who sup- port the PLSG at all three components of the event, the 20th fel-lowship symposium sponsored by the Program on Law and State Government.\" (ABOVE) PLSG Fellow Katie Whitley, foreground, moderated a session featuring John Woodrow Cox, Washington Post staff writer and author of the book Children Under Fire: An American Crisis, and Dr. Joseph B.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 35 Lee Little, '16, Writes Book on Indianapolis Churches Some people made jokes about writing books during the lockdown period of the pandemic. Lee Little, '16, Research and Instruction Li- brarian and Adjunct Lecturer in Law at the Ruth Lilly Law Library at IU McKinney, actually wrote a book. Circle City Steeples has been published by Verdere Press on Mass Ave. in Indianapolis. Little wrote the text and his friend, Kati Gaschler of Kati Q. Photography, provided the photographs. The project grew out of an Instagram account, Old Churches Indy, that Little started in 2018. According to Little, Indianapolis has more congregations per capita than any city in the world. Some of them look like small homes while others are soaring and opulent and are landmarks in their neighborhoods. \"I think you can tell the story of a city through the story of its congregations,\" Little said. Living on the Old Northside in Indianapolis, Little began visiting the 300 churches that were standing in 1952 and are still standing today. He chose that time period because it predates Unigov and the rise of modernist architecture. He pulled his list from a 1952 Indi- anapolis city directory and started walking to the churches in and around his neighborhood, bringing along his wife and their dog. The couple visited 60 churches on one Saturday during pandemic lock- down, driving by and snapping photos. Little was confident in his ability to write the book but wanted the photography to shine. Gaschler attended one of the walking tours Little offered in support of the project, and she became interested in taking the photographs. The pair's interest in places of worship is organic: Gaschler is married to a Missouri Synod Lutheran minister and Little is a member of the Episcopal Church of All Saints and his- toriographer of the Episcopal Dioses of Indianapolis. Little and Gaschler made a list of 100 churches they wanted to learn more about and contacted congregation leaders asking to pho-tograph and write about their places of worship. The pair is donating 10 percent of the book's profits to Indiana Landmarks' Sacred Places project, which provides intensive training in stewardship, communi- ty engagement, and fundraising for congregations. People connected with 36 current and former houses of worship responded in favor of taking part in the book. There are a number of historically Black congregations represent- ed in the book, including Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church, where Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. preached on a visit to In- dianapolis. The book also includes a synagogue, which is owned by Indiana Landmarks.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINEIU McKinney Law student Katie Whitley has been named a Skadden Fellow, a nationally prestigious public interest fellowship. Whitley, a 2022 J.D. candidate, is one of 28 fellows from 19 differ- ent law schools who will partner with legal services nonprofits across the country, according to a November 23 announcement from the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Affiliates. She will partner with Indiana Legal Services to create the first school-based civil legal aid initiative in the Indianapolis region designed to serve low-income families with school-aged children experiencing housing and economic instability. Her fellowship will also include en- gaging students in creating Know Your Rights educational materials in housing law and public benefits. The project idea grew out of her experience as a teacher in India- napolis, and her connections to the communities she hopes to serve, Whitley says. \"As a teacher, I recognized that great community partnerships were essential in providing a range of resources and services to families in times of crisis. Notably, however, a legal partnership was missing. I often did not have the answer to families dealing IU McKinney Law Student Katie Whitley Named a Skadden Fellow with a housing or financial crisis,\" Whitley says. \"My project can be that answer.\" Whitley credited IU McKinney Law professors Florence Roisman, Lahny Silva, and Fran Quigley in providing support for her project. \"In particular, Professor Roisman provided me with foundational legal knowledge in housing law and inspired me to pursue a posi- tion working to disrupt housing insecurity. Professor Silva gave me the opportunity to serve vulnerable populations in their neighborhoods through SCRAP and REACH. This community-based model to 'meet people where they are' is a crucial aspect of my project,\" she says. Through the Health and Human Rights Clinic, Professor Quigley su-pervised her direct client work in housing and brief advice sessions in eviction courts as well as multiple research opportunities to better un- derstand the breadth of the eviction crisis in Indianapolis, she says. Launched in 1988 to commemorate its 40th anniversary, the Skadden Foundation has funded 934 public interest fellowships. This 34th class joins the existing community of Skadden Fellows who are engaged in public interest work in 41 states.

Health Law Program Receives A+ Grade from preLaw Magazine PreLaw Magazine's back-to-school edition rated IU McKin- ney tops in three different areas: government, health law, and public service. The law school received an A+ grade in health law from preLaw. The publication grades the nation's health law pro- grams based on the breadth of their curricular offerings, in- cluding opportunities such as externships, certificates, clinic experiences and student organizations. The William S. and Christine S. Hall Center for Law and Health was established in 1987 to expand the curriculum and teaching of health law and provide opportunities for students. The Hall Center offers more than 30 health law- related courses as well as a Certificate in Health Law, six dual-degrees in health-related fields, and a LL.M. in Health Law, Policy, and Bioethics. In addition to hosting a multi-tude of events, symposia and the annual Health Law Grand Rounds lecture series, the Hall Center publishes the Indi- ana Health Law Review. 38 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINEHALL CENTER FOR LAW AND HEALTH Sandy Miller, '82, has carried a passion for learning throughout her life and two careers\u2014first as an English teacher and then as a lawyer at one of the nation's largest health benefits companies. Miller grew up in Morristown, Indiana, and became the first member of her family to attend college. After earning B.A. and M.A. degrees from Indiana State Uni-versity, she taught Eng- lish at Warren Central High School. Although she loved teaching, \"I wanted to learn more. I craved more variety. I would have happily been a student for my whole life,\" she says. Miller briefly consid- ered applying to medical school but focused on law school after taking an in- troductory evening class and being admitted to IU McKinney. She continued teaching while attending law school in the evening, an endeavor that took more than four years, but ended in Miller graduating summa cum laude. \"I really loved the challenge of law school. It was just a great, great environment,\" she says. Miller clerked for two years at the Indiana Supreme Court and then joined the legal staff of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana (subsequently Anthem) where she served from 1985 until 2008, ultimately as the acting general counsel. Sandy and Bernie Miller Health Law Fellowship Reflects Donor Love for Learning From 2008 to 2012, Miller was the president of Anthem's federal government business. She retired in 2012. Her husband, Bernie, who served on the faculty and coached basketball, tennis, and baseball at several high schools, is also retired. In 2018, they decided to channel Miller's passion for learning and education into a fellow- ship assisting IU McKin-ney Law students. \"Law school was a real springboard to the kind of career that allowed me to give back,\" Miller says. The Sandy and Bernie Miller Fellowship is awarded to J.D. students who work in unpaid summer positions as part of their participa- tion in the school's Wil- liam S. and Christine S. Hall Center for Law and Health. Eight law students have received fellow-ships during the past three years, including four Hall Center students who received fellowships for the summer of 2021. \"One of the best parts of establishing the fellowship is that I actually hear from recipients,\" Miller says. \"They have written to tell me about their lives, their time in law school, and how much the fellowship means to them. That is a really special kind of thank you, letting me know that this is working.\" IU ROBERT H.

As an undergraduate majoring in criminal justice at Indiana University in Bloomington, Sargent was part of a student-run emergency medical services team and became an emergency medical technician (EMT), where she discovered the area of health law. \"I realized that was going to be my true passion,\" she says. \"I was fortunate to be admitted to IU McKinney, which has a top health law program and offered me the opportunity to learn from leaders in my field. I greatly appreciated the devoted faculty and being at the center of everything in Indianapolis, especially since my focus was on government and policy.\" During her second year of law school, Sargent committed to the J.D./M.P.H. dual-degree program with the IU Fairbanks School of Public Health and embarked on a series of externships that took her from St. Francis Hospital to the Indiana State Department of Health and the Indiana Region of the American Red Cross.Sargent was in the inaugural class of Health Law Scholars at IU McKinney, where she also volunteered with the IU Student Outreach Clinic, and as a member of the IUPUI Public Health Corps, working on assignments that in- clude researching sexual harassment/sex- ual assault laws for the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence. After law school\u2014and as COVID-19 reached Indiana in early 2020\u2014Sargent was working at the Indiana State Depart-ment of Health in public health emergency preparedness. As COVID cases began being reported and state health officials activated the emergency operations center, Sargent recalls that soon, \"things exploded.\" In her work with the Red Cross, Sargent had helped with emergency responses to major flooding in West Virginia and a tornado outbreak in Ko- komo, but the COVID-19 response was a new, historic level, she says. 40 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINEHALL CENTER FOR LAW AND HEALTH Sargent's office at the Indiana Depart- ment of Health routinely managed federal grants for emergency preparedness, but in a matter of weeks the amount tripled. Coordinating the statewide COVID-19 re- sponse soon drew in not only the 12-per- son team Sargent worked on, but, eventu- ally, several entities of state government, and involved working with county and local health departments in every corner of Indiana. In August 2020, Sargent left the Indiana State Department of Health to join the fed- eral response at the CDC. \"For someone who is passionate about this particular area of law and public health, it is the experience of a lifetime,\" Sargent says. \"I believe we will see a new era of emergency preparedness laws fol- lowing this pandemic, similar to the poli- cy changes that occurred after the terror- ist attacks on 9/11 and after Hurricane Katrina.\" Sargent says that her law school educa- tion, combined with her master's in public health, have provided a crucial knowledge base for her current role at the CDC as the COVID-19 crisis continues to evolve. \"People get frustrated working in gov- ernment, and the politics and bureaucracy can be difficult,\" she says. \"But that's why I want to work in this space. It is hard, yet it is an honor to be working for the American taxpayer. I felt that way when I worked in Indiana, and I feel that way now, work- ing for all U.S. citizens.

The Hall Center and the student-led Health Law Society hosted two collaborative events\u2014panels on Disability Law and T exas Abortion Bill\u2014during the fall semester. \"As law students, we have an obligation to fight for those who have historically been deprived of rights such as the right to reproductive care or the right to reason-able accommodations under the ADA, \" said Kennedy E. Bunch, a 2023 J.D. candi- date and president of the Health Law Society at IU McKinney. \"As such, hosting con-versations with lawyers, doctors, and academics who have a deep understanding of the implications of restricting rights is crucial in ensuring we engage, inform, and educate law students adequately on these issues in a nonpartisan fashion. \" The Health Law Society found these panels to be extremely successful, Bunch said. \"The online format allowed us to have conversations with individuals across the country and make it safely accessible to those who may have been unable to join in person, \" she said. \"Students and guests had the opportunity to ask these highly regarded individuals inquisitive questions to better understand the implications and shortcomings of the relevant laws. \" The Hall Center and the Health Law Society also collaborated on the launch of a new Peer Mentor Program, with a total of 26 students participating. Alumni lead another mentoring effort through the Hall Center Mentor Board, which assists health-law students in building a professional network and honing the skills they need to succeed. Alumni and students met for 16 \"Coffee Chats\" during the fall semester. Coffee Chats and other networking opportunities requires the assistance of pro- fessionals willing to lend a hand, including volunteers like Jacob Butz, '20, an attor - ney in Ice Miller's Health Care Practice Group. \"I absolutely enjoy working with Hall Center students, \" Butz says. \"It's almost like looking in a mirror since I was in their shoes not even two years ago. I enjoy sharing my insight and guidance on how I think students can shape themselves for success in the tightly knit Indianapolis health law community. \" That kind of outreach might be more important than ever. Having secured em- ployment during a pandemic, Butz is familiar with the types of fears and concerns that students are experiencing. \"I use that experience to reduce any stress that's associated with the job hunt, \" Butz says. \"Working with health law students at IU McKinney is the least I could do considering how instrumental the Hall Center and its amazing faculty and staff were in my development as a health law professional.

In the inaugural competition, students were asked to consider an area of maternal and child health that Indiana could improve upon and discuss a law that could be used to implement changes necessary to better serve Indiana women and children. The writing prompt\u2014and the competition itself\u2014was created by the Hall Center for Law and Health Coordinator Angela Larracey as a project for the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities (LEND) graduate-level interdisciplinary leadership training program at Riley Child Development Center. LEND T raining is designed for people who will advocate on behalf of people with neuro-developmental disabilities, a broad category that includes autism, anxiety, Down's Syn- drome, attention-deficit disorder, and many other conditions. Larracey has several family members with neuro-develop- mental disabilities and believes LEND training will be helpful in providing support to them and others in the community. She's been working on LEND certification and the project for nearly a year, with the support of Hall Center Executive Direc- tor Nicolas T erry and Associate Director Brittany Kelly. T aking the competition from a concept to finalizing the details and taking it live was more complicated than Larracey anticipated, but she's pleased with the potential outcome. \"The day that IndyBar called to tell me that registration was open, I was ready to do cartwheels in my living room, \" Larracey says. \"As a state, Indiana's maternal health and overall health of women and children rankings are low, which has a direct im- pact on outcomes for individuals with neuro-developmental disabilities, \" she says. \"Hopefully, students will come up with ideas to help Indiana get out of that bottom rung and improve lives for people in Indiana. \" Read more about the winner of the competition, Farrah Alexander, on page 13.

The clinic students will be executing trademark and patent searches as well as engaging in trademark application prosecution and pat-ent drafting and prosecution. \"This includes opportunities for direct interaction with patent examiners and trade- mark examining attorneys at the United States Patent and Trademark Office,\" Lavender said. \"Accordingly, the IP Clinic gives students a glimpse of real-world legal practice and client management.\" The IP Law Clinic has drawn students who discovered their passion for intellectual property law while in law school. Among them are 4L evening student Helga Davila, LL.M. '18. She became interested in IP law while earn- ing her law degree at Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa; she is originally from Lima, Peru. She plans to fo- cus on commercial law and IP law after completing her J.D. at IU McKinney. Fariraishe Muzondo, a 4L evening student, became interested in IP law during the summer prior to entering law school when she was taking part in the Indiana Conference for Continuing Legal Educa- tion Opportunity program; the writing assignment was on trade secrets. Third-year law student Ming Yang also found her interest in IP, particularly trademark law, while at IU McKinney. The IP Law Clinic is giving Yang and her classmates the skills they will need to practice after com- pleting their legal educations. \"We're learning to think like a lawyer, Yang said. \"We discuss more deeply what the client needs.\" Other IP Law Clinic students knew before they en- rolled at IU McKinney this was the area upon which they wanted to focus. Chitra Ram studied intellectual prop- erty for engineers at Purdue University. The 3L received a biological engineering degree before enrolling in law school. And Luke Peterson studied aerospace engineer- ing at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and worked as an engineer in the software and controls arena before beginning law school. The 3L evening program student currently works as a controls engineer writing software for electric vehicles. Like Ram and Peterson, Clark knew he wanted to fo- cus on intellectual property at IU McKinney. \"I regularly advise clients on copyright protection, registration and licensing, as well as on a variety of issues and transac- tions within the field of entertainment, advertising, so- cial media, and websites,\" Clark said. \"What appeals to me about IP is that it is so prevalent in our day-to-day lives, and it often comprises the most valuable assets of a company.\" The IU McKinney Law 2022 IP Symposium will take place virtually on Friday, April 1, 2022.

Author, Survivor of Rwanda Genocide Visits Professor Edwards IU McKinney School of Law and Escola da Magistratura/ AJURIS in Brazil launched the inaugural Series in Ameri-can Legal Education from May 17 to August 2. The first cohort was made up of 12 judges from Brazil who took part in \"English for Legal Professionals.\" The program was designed to allow the jurists to delve into the linguistics of statutory interpretation, rule synthesis, and case reading. The judges also practiced their spoken legal English by in-terviewing clients and presenting oral arguments. Catherine Beck, who is the Legal English Specialist for IU McKinney's LL.M. Program and teaches as an adjunct professor at the law school, taught the series via Zoom. The judges wanted to focus on the language of the U.S. legal system, particularly in the areas of common law and precedent, she said. Precedents were of particular interest to the students as Brazil is adopting a similar system, inspired by the Ameri-can model, said Judge Patricia Antunes Laydner, vice dean at Escola Superior da Magistratura/AJURIS. Class participants said they were challenged by the exer- cises that prepared them for the oral argument portion of IU McKinney and AJURIS Launch Series in American Legal Education the course. Writing the arguments involved a great deal of technical vocabulary. \"Still, and perhaps because of this, it was also the most interesting activity,\" Judge Laydner said. \"I would strongly recommend the course to my colleagues.\" \"During the classes, I realized the peculiarities of some words and expressions that I got in touch with,\" said Judge Josiane Caleffi Estivalet of Rio Grande do Sul State Tribunal de Justice. \"So, now I know that it's es-sential to improve my vocabulary to have a better com-prehension of the American legal system and its own way of communicating.\" The students appreciated Beck and the way she taught the course. \"Our teacher was amazing because she was always kind and approachable,\" Judge Estivalet said. \"It was one of the best online experiences I ever had,\" Esti-valet says. Assistant Dean of Graduate Programs Miki Hamstra initiated and organized the program.

The reasonable cost of living in Indianapolis; IU McKinney's affordable J.D. students, and fac- ulty; and faculty who understand the needs of foreign students are all part of what make IU McKinney special. IU McKinney's LL.M. Program Lauded by National JuristA passion for working with children and families inspired Mahesha Tennekoon, LL.M. '20, to secure an externship with the Indiana Department of Child Services in spring 2020. Before earning her LL.M. through IU McKinney's American Law for Foreign Lawyers track, Tennekoon got her \"dream job\" as a family case manager in the agency. \"I wanted to join DCS and to be a part of that family,\" Tennekoon said. \"Even before I graduated, I found my dream job at DCS.\" In November 2020, Tennekoon began working fulltime as a family case manager with the Marion County Depart- ment of Child Services, where she assesses child abuse and neglect reports. \"My LL.M. degree helped me to secure a government job,\" she says. \"I really enjoy my work,\" she said. \"I am proud to be working with DCS to secure the future for the children in Indiana.\" \"As part of our LL.M. program,\" Tennekoon said, \"we get a chance to work as a legal extern in a variety of legal firms or a gov- ernment department in the U.S. This was a golden opportunity to gain practical experience in the American legal system that we had studied during the first semester.\" \"From day one after joining as an extern,\" Tennekoon said, \"I noticed that the Department of Child Services is a welcoming place for any extern.\" Tennekoon initially went through the agency's two-week manda- tory employee training on its policies, vision, mission, and values.

Alumna's Externship Evolves into Fulltime Job curity, legislative drafting and lobbying, emergency strategy plans, childcare services, and family case management. Her externship included a live class with experienced fam-ily case managers and lawyers. In addition, Tennekoon participated in the agency's family case managers and attorneys train- ing, including deposition-taking. Tennekoon was able to attend one of the agency's administrative hearings. \"That was a good experience on how the admin- istrative hearings are conducted to resolve people's everyday life issues,\" she said. Tennekoon practiced civil law in Sri Lanka before joining McKinney's LL.M. program in 2019. In her home country, she dealt with land law, family law, and money mat- ters. \"I used my prior knowledge and skills to understand the ad-ministrative procedures and what will happen if one of the parties is not satisfied with the decision. By learning and studying about an administrative hearing, I compared the laws and its procedures of my home country.\" Tennekoon also observed an Indiana Supreme Court proceeding involving a case wherein the agency had termi-nated parental rights. \"The DCS provided me an excellent environment to learn all ar- eas and duties of a lawyer,\" Tennekoon said. \"I would recommend DCS as one of the best places to do an externship. I would like to suggest all the LL.M. students who come from foreign countries to participate in an externship with a governmental agency to gain endless experience and knowledge.\" 50 IU ROBERT H.

Zgheib completed her Master of Laws studies with distinction on the International and Compara- tive Law track and attributes the success she has found in this phase in her career to the education she received at IU McKinney. \"I learned from IU McKinney the way to think, \" Zgheib said, \"how to think properly, how to analyze properly. \" Zgheib has been training as a judge at the Leb- anese Institute of T raining and Judicial Studies since August 2019. The training includes theoret - ical and practical courses, as well as placements in various judicial chambers where trainee judges participate in deliberations. She is currently train- ing at the Execution Appeal Court. She has completed training with the Real Estate First Degree Court and the Commercial First Degree Court. Zgheib prides herself on being an IU McKinney graduate. \"I am the IU McKinney Master of Laws Graduate Takes Part in Judicial Training Program only current trainee judge with a masters from the USA. \" She finds what she learned at IU McKinney applies to her judicial work. Her IU McKinney education, she said, made it \"easier for me to identify and structure a problem. Even the mediation class enabled me to bal- ance my intellect with my intuition and helped me to become more comfortable with the decision-making process as a trainee judge. \" Zgheib will complete her judicial training in 2022. It has been slowed significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For ex - ample, one session that would have been completed in six months in ordinary cir - cumstances took 18 months instead. The delays haven't deterred her. \"I will keep learning, \" she said. \"I will keep working. \" Zgheib will also start teaching business law at the American University of Science and T echnology in January 2022.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 55 Faculty News In July, Cynthia Baker contributed to Indiana University's partnership with the Associated Press called \"Campus Insights\" with a recorded video on Ohio's anti-hazing law. Passed in summer 2021, \"Collin's Law\" strengthens the penal- ties against those who participate in hazing, expands the scope of responsibil- ity of those within institutions of higher education to report incidents of hazing, and requires a statewide anti-hazing plan to be led by the Ohio Department of Higher Education. After speaking about the nature of Collin Wiant's death and other rituals of hazing on college campuses throughout our nation, Professor Baker said, \"to the extent that law is a democratic acknowledgment of a real problem that has an actual solution, Ohio's law is a step in the right direction. \" Professor Baker continued to serve as the faculty advisor for 2021 Program on Law and State Government Fellowships, the culmination of which was a hy - brid symposium titled Gun Laws and Gun Violence: State Governments Making a Difference. Hosted on October 1, 2021, the event featured the ideas, research, and work of the 2021 Program on Law and State Government Fellows, law stu- dents Chaka Coleman and Katie Whitley. The entire event was based on foun- dational questions about the role of state governments in addressing gun laws and gun violence. For example, recognizing the power of the Second Amend-ment, are state governments relegated to the margins or are there ways state governments can make a difference in combatting gun violence? Professor Baker continues her service on the Pro Bono Working Group of the Indiana Supreme Court's Coalition for Court Access and on the law school faculty's executive committee. In May 2021, Jim Dimitri was awarded the Indiana University T rustee's T eaching Award for his outstanding performance as a teacher.

However, in more recent years, the protections provided by international investment law have frequently resulted in battles between well-funded multinationals on the one side and poorly trained and underfunded government officials on the other. In more than a few cases, developing nations have been convicted to pay large sums in damages although the countries are barely able to cover current debt and other expenses and the corporations were not necessarily without fault in the dispute. Poor representation of the developing nations has been a major concern, both in the theoretical develop-ment of the topic and in the settlement of disputes before international arbi- tration tribunals. T o address the uneven access to educational opportunities, textbooks, and other cutting-edge material, the project brings together some 30 experts from more than 15 countries who are collaborating on a textbook that will be provided free of charge/open access to students and young profes-sionals around the world. The group also is producing a series of webinars and online training modules to accompany the textbook, as well as a volume with the most advanced academic research on the current challenges and future directions of international investment law. About half of the textbook is com-plete and publication is expected in spring 2022. In addition to coordinating the project, Professor Emmert is authoring several of the chapters. In the area of Blockchain law, Professor Emmert continued his work on the development of a course for IU. An in-person version is scheduled for the spring semester at IU Maurer School of Law. An online version is expected to be available in fall 2022 at IU McKinney. He wrote and submitted a chapter on \"Opportunities Presented by AI and Blockchain T echnology for Enterprises in International Business T ransactions\" in Alexandra Mendoza-Caminade (ed), Business and AI, IFR Lextenso editions, France, 2022, and he made presen- tations on Blockchain technology and its evolving regulation in different ju- risdictions at the universities of Basle (Switzerland) and T oulouse (France).

Carrie Hagan has published a chapter in the book, Feminist Judgments: Re- written Property Opinions, that was published in October 2021 by Cambridge University Press. The chapter addresses the opinion in T aylor v. Canterbury, and Professor Hagan and her co-author, Professor Diane Klein, discuss whether a special right such as survivorship should exist. The book is part of the United States Feminist Judgments Projects. In the project, rewritten opinions must use the facts and precedent of the original but bring to the judging process a feminist perspective that takes into account race, class, gender, disability, and other status groups historically marginalized by law.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I WINTER 2021 -2022 ALUMNI MAGAZINEJayme Little Assistant Dean for Alumni RelationsI am excited to join the Inlow Hall team to lead efforts to drive continued alumni engagement with the school. I have spent my first few weeks listening to both colleagues in the building and members of the Alumni Association board of directors, and it's clear that there's a tre- mendous pride for the IU McKinney School of Law and the important work you do for not only Indiana, but the national and global community. I plan to continue my listening tour to better understand how the IU McKinney School of Law Alumni Association can continue to make an impact on you, our students, and the profession. I want to create meaningful opportunities for you to purposefully engage with the school, and your input is a vital part of the equation. I'd welcome the opportunity to learn more about your McKinney and professional journey and how the school has impacted you and your career. The past two years have proven to be a challenge for us all. Our opportunities to connect with others have been put on hold ... or on Zoom for all the fun that has created (\"you're on mute\"). As we explore new opportunities for in-person connections moving forward, I also recognize the role that distance technology will continue to play in connecting us no matter where we live\u2014Indianapolis, San Francisco, or Beijing. While IU McKinney is currently explor - ing in-person networking opportunities in major metropolitan areas around the country, I am actively seeking out ways in which alumni, regardless of their proximity to the school, can en- gage. It is my goal to build a portfolio of opportunities ... both in person and virtual ... to keep you connected. I welcome your ideas. I want to publicly thank my friend and mentor Stefan Davis for his many dedicated years of service to law school alumni and his decades of service to IUPUI. His contributions to this campus are immense, and he deserves every ounce of appreciation that comes his way. With your help, we can continue to build IU McKinney programs for generations to come. Whether you give your time and talents when mentoring students or your treasure to sup- port the school, you play an important role at IU McKinney. I look forward to meeting many of you and exploring more about what makes this place so special!
