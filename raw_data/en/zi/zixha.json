We know that polishes contain a lot of chemicals, but where do these ingredients come from? Are they cruelty-free? Unfortunately, often toxic and tested on animals, the allies of our most lustrous manicures usually hide many harmful ingredients and equally regrettable manufacturing processes. Animal-based ingredients Here are 3 of the most common animal-sourced ingredients found in nail polish that should be avoided: Guanine This ingredient is derived from fish scales and certain acids found in animal tissue. It is an ingredient usually used to create highlights. It helps to add shine to nail polish. Carmine Red nail fans, beware, as this ingredient is unfortunately often used to create that rich shade that instantly adds allure. In fact, it's crushed cochineal that often gives polish its vibrant color. Oleic acid Often used to thicken polish, it comes from animal fat. Bad for your health? An itchy nose, a pair of glasses to straighten, a cream to apply, fingers and nails are constantly in contact with the face and mouth. So it's best if the product that beautifies them is healthy for us, but is it? Some of the chemicals in nail polish can be carcinogenic and endocrine disrupting. Fortunately, there are alternatives. When shopping for a new nail polish, look for the \"non-toxic\" designation. This means it will be less harmful to your body. If you're transitioning to a healthier lifestyle, switching to non-toxic nail polishes can be a great addition to your beauty routine. Can nail polish be natural? Whatever the polish, even if it is labeled \"Non-Toxic\" or \"Vegan\", it can never be 100% natural, since some chemicals are essential to its color and texture. However, it is possible to get polishes that are more environmentally friendly, our health and animal friendly. Phew! Indeed, some cosmetic brands, such as BKIND, use the least amount of chemicals possible. Therefore, it is possible to find nail polishes that are labeled \"3-Free\", which means that they do not contain three of the most toxic ingredients normally found in nail polish.
