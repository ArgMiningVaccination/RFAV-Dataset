This is why it is especially important not to offer such exemptions to coronavirus vaccine mandates. They make a mockery of Christianity and religious liberty. ...](https://taxprof.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4eab53ef026bdef1c6c1200c-popup) My plea to my fellow Christians: If you insist on refusing the vaccine, that is your right. But please do not bring God into it. Doing so is the very definition of violating the Third Commandment, \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\" ... Vaccine hesitancy has never been a core religious belief of evangelical Christians. The [vast majority](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/07/majorities-in-all-major-religious-groups-support-requiring-childhood-vaccination/) of evangelicals have historically chosen to be immunized against polio, measles, tetanus and other diseases. As a child, I attended evangelical summer camps that required vaccinations, and as an adult, I worked for ministries with similar mandates. Some conservative evangelicals just don't like the political taste of this particular vaccine on the menu. ... [R]eligious leaders will need to join with secular institutions in opposing exemptions. Pastors are already being inundated with requests for letters supporting exemptions. As a former pastor of an evangelical church, I know it will be difficult to say \"no.\" But my colleagues should do the right thing and refuse such requests. Refuse to mislead our secular neighbors. Refuse to abuse our precious religious liberty. Refuse to be complicit in putting our neighbors at risk. ... The vaccine effort has been plagued by falsehoods of all kinds. The religious exemption from vaccine mandates for Christians is the latest lie. All of us should stand together for the truth. David French (The French Press), [It's Time to Stop Rationalizing and Enabling Evangelical Vaccine Rejection](https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/its-time-to-stop-rationalizing-christian): There is no religious liberty interest in refusing the COVID vaccine. As the coronavirus's Delta variant rips through ( [mainly](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html)) the Southeastern United States, two things are becoming clear at once. First, amidst the dark clouds of continued disease, there is the silver lining of an increased number of vaccines. After hitting a weekly low in early July, the pace has picked up to an average of almost [900,000 vaccinations a day](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html). Through persuasion and mandates, America is chipping away at vaccine reluctance. At the same time, however, the remaining vaccine holdouts are growing more extreme, and significant parts of the Christian Right are enabling, excusing, and validating Evangelical behavior that is gravely wrong and dangerous to the lives and health of their fellow citizens. For example, there is a scramble by Christian Americans to seek \"religious exemptions\" from employer vaccine mandates. I've received correspondence from Christian religious liberty ministries who report a sharp rise in requests for legal assistance to secure religious exemptions. One ministry indicated in an email to affiliated attorneys that it had been \"inundated by requests\" for help. A pastor in a large church in California has [promised to hand out \"religious exemption forms\"](https://www.sacbee.com/news/coronavirus/article253485334.html) to anyone who attends the church and asks. ... As we approach nine months of vaccine availability and nine months of flood-the-zone coverage of vaccine safety and efficacy, it is clear that much (though certainly not all) of our remaining refusal problem is not one of information but one of moral formation itself. The very moral framework of millions of our fellow citizens\u2014the way in which they understand the balance between liberty and responsibility\u2014is gravely skewed. To understand the skew, it's first necessary to understand the proper balance, and while we have vaccine endorsements from Christian leaders from across the Catholic/Protestant spectrum, we also have guidance from church fathers\u2014individuals who no one can claim have caved to some \"establishment\" or are motivated by supposed invites to mythical beltway \"cocktail parties.\" For example, read these [famous words from Martin Luther](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2020/may-web-only/martin-luther-plague-pandemic-coronavirus-covid-flee-letter.html), written during a plague in his own time: Therefore I shall ask God mercifully to protect us. Then I shall fumigate, help purify the air, administer medicine, and take it. I shall avoid places and persons where my presence is not needed in order not to become contaminated and thus perchance infect and pollute others, and so cause their death as a result of my negligence. If God should wish to take me, he will surely find me and I have done what he has expected of me and so I am not responsible for either my own death or the death of others. If my neighbor needs me, however, I shall not avoid place or person but will go freely, as stated above. See, this is such a God-fearing faith because it is neither brash nor foolhardy and does not tempt God. The balance is clear. It is incumbent on the Christian to take care of themselves, including by taking medicine \"in order not to become contaminated\" (a nice definition of a vaccine before vaccines were invented). To the extent that he or she takes risks, those risks should be on behalf of others. As a person created in the image of God, taking care of yourself is an independent good. Taking care of yourself so that you can care for others is an even nobler good. Christian vaccine refusal not only rejects self-care, it enhances risks to innocent and vulnerable neighbors. Even vaccinated people can catch relatively rare breakthrough cases. And every person\u2014regardless of vaccination status\u2014is [vulnerable to the strains placed on a region's hospitals](https://twitter.com/ksprior/status/1431355076115943427?s=21) when COVID runs rampant. I also fear that the relentless right-wing political focus on religious liberty has obscured two realities\u2014that our liberties have limits when they collide with the rights of others, and that the exercise of our liberty carries with it profound moral responsibility. ... Now is the time to take a clear stand. Not in a way that mocks or condescends, but one can be firm while also being respectful. As the [Apostle Paul told Timothy](https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-7.htm), \"God has not given us a spirit of fear, but one of power, love, and sound judgment.\" The power is not political power, but the power of God over the fears of man. The love is for God and for our neighbor. And sound judgment should help us separate lies from truth and tell us that no argument for liberty should trump our responsibility to spare our nation and our neighbors and finally take the vaccine. - The Atlantic, [Evangelical Leader Fired After Getting Vaccinated\u2014And Encouraging Others to Do So](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/09/dan-darling-national-religious-broadcasters-evangelicals-vaccines/619988/) - Columbus Dispatch, [Faith and the COVID Vaccine: What Religions Have Doctrinal Reasons For Being Unvaccinated?](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2021/09/11/covid-19-few-religions-have-doctrinal-reasons-avoid-vaccine/8271710002/) - FiveThirtyEight, [Why Some White Evangelical Republicans Are So Opposed To The COVID-19 Vaccine](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-some-white-evangelical-republicans-are-so-opposed-to-the-covid-19-vaccine/) - David French (The French Press), [The American Crisis of Selective Empathy](https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/the-american-crisis-of-selective) - Relevant, [Why Won't Christians Get Vaccinated?](https://www.relevantmagazine.com/magazine/why-wont-christians-get-vaccinated/) - Stuff, [Covid-19: Mark of the Beast or Manna From Heaven?
