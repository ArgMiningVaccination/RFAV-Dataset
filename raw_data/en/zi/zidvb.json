Ferris, MD, Jennifer L. Waller, PhD, Ashley Owen, and Jozette Smith Objective: To determine correlates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine acceptance in mid-adult women. Methods: A convenience sample of 472 mid-adult women completed a 2-part, 69-item survey that included demographic, knowledge, and behavioral variables as potential correlates of vaccine accep- tance. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify correlates for vac-cine acceptance. Results: Mid-adult women who received the HPV vaccine were more likely to be younger than 55 years (P <.001); have had an abnormal Papanicolaou test (odds ratio [OR], 2.15; 95% CI, 1.18 -3.92); understand that HPV causes cervical cancer (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.08 -5.30); feel at risk (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.00 - 4.57), and feel it is important for their partner (OR, 25.20; 95% CI,9.66 - 65.72) and children (OR, vaccine. Monogamous mid-adultwomen (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21-1.00); women who did not want any vaccines (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07-0.92); and women who felt it was too late to get the vaccine (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.08 - 0.44) were lesslikely to HPV vaccine. Conclusions: These clinical predictors of HPV vaccine acceptance will help clinicians recognize mid- adult women who may be more receptive to vaccination. (J Am Board Fam Med 2008;21:31-37.) Primary cervical cancer prevention has become a reality with the availability of the rst prophylactichuman papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (Gardasil,Merck and Co., Inc, Whitehouse Station, NJ). Thequadrivalent L1 virus-like particle HPV vaccine is expected to prevent 70% of cervical cancer causedby oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18, and 90% ofgenital warts caused by nononcogenic HPV types 6and 11. When administered to adolescent andyoung adult women it was 100% effective in pre-venting true cancer precursors of the lower genitaltract caused by the 4 HPV types included in thevaccine, provided women received all 3 doses (at 0,2, and 6 months), and were HPV DNA negative tothe 4 HPV types at day 0 and remained HPV DNA negative to the 4 HPV types until after completionof the third dose. 1This amazingly robust result can be expected when the vaccine is administrated tochildren, adolescents, and young women (ages 9 to26 years) who are not yet sexually active. However, mid-adult women ( /H1135027 years old) have expressed a keen interest in also receiving theHPV vaccine. 2These women want the vaccine to stay healthy, to prevent cervical cancer and genitalwarts, and because of a fear of cervical cancer andgenital warts. 2,3Although many women in this age group are no longer considered sexually na \u00a8ve, there may be good rationale for vaccinating thesemore mature and informed women. It is very un-likely that most mid-adult women have been pre-viously exposed to all 4 HPV types from which thevaccine affords protection. Based on an acceptablesafety prole for children and younger women, onecould assume the vaccine will also convey a com-parable safety prole for older women. 1Although neutralizing antibody levels are expected to belower in mid-adult women, we would expect ampleneutralizing antibody titers to provide protectionbased on the robust immune response demon-strated in the younger population.

Ongoing clinical trials will provide these important data for mid-adultwomen in the next few years. As opposed to an established and recommended HPV vaccination program for children and youngwomen, a \"catch-up\" vaccination program for mid-adult women has not yet been implemented. Manymid-adult women are interested in receiving theHPV vaccine, but others are not. 2,3Identied barriers to vaccine acceptance include being married, cost, andpossible perception of being promiscuous if they re-ceive the HPV vaccine. 3To date, little is known about predictors of HPV vaccination preference byan older group of women. The purpose of theseanalyses were to determine correlates of acceptance ofthe HPV vaccine by mid-adult women. Methods Subject PopulationWe recruited a convenience sample of mid-adultwomen (/H1135025 years old) from the community and medical clinics located in 3 southern US cities (At-lanta and Augusta, Georgia, and San Antonio,Texas) during the summer of 2006. An arbitraryinclusion limit of women 25 years or older wasconsidered, and this range was selected before theFDA approval for current vaccination of women upTable 1.

Other inclusion criteria were an ability to read and write in English. The Medical College ofGeorgia Human Assurance Committee approvedthis study (HAC le #06-04-276). Study Design and Instrument Complete details of the HPV vaccine acceptancequestionnaire for mid-adult women have been pub-lished previously. 2Survey development began with focus group input, followed by a pretrial pilot of thedraft survey. Subjects completed a 46-question initial(pre-intervention) survey, read a 1-page educationalpamphlet then com-pleted a 23-question postintervention survey. Certainquestions included in these surveys allowed for assess-ment of demographic, knowledge, and behavioralvariables as potential correlates of HPV vaccine ac-ceptance among mid-adult women. The pre-inter-vention survey included demographic data, sexual his-tory, Papanicolaou test and sexually transmittedinfection history, lifestyle practices, knowledge aboutvaccines, cervical cancer, and attitudes about HPVvaccines. The postintervention survey assessed sub-jects' attitudes, knowledge, and acceptance of theHPV vaccines. Each survey included multiple choice,true/false, open-ended, rank preference by order, andmultiple response questions. The same HPV educa-tional pamphlet and portions of the survey were usedin a previous study of parents' acceptance of an HPVvaccine for their children. 4 Statistical AnalysesEach potential correlate of wanting to get theHPV vaccine after intervention was examinedrst using /H9273 2tests or ttests. There were 3 sets ofcorrelates that were examined: (1) demographic variables, (2) knowledge and behaviors beforeintervention, and (3) knowledge and behaviorsafter intervention. Those variables statisticallysignicant in the /H9273 2or ttests were entered into a univariable logistic regression model and the odds ratio, 95% condence interval for the oddsratio, and statistical signicance were deter-mined. For each set of models (demographic,pre-intervention, or postintervention), thosevariables statistically signicant in the univari-able models were placed in a multivariable logis-tic regression model. A backwards, stepwise elim-ination procedure was used on each model set toarrive at a nal multivariable logistic regressionmodel for the set. All statistical signicance wasassessed using an /H9251-level of 0.05 and all statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.3(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Results Demographic DataA total of 675 women were asked to participate inthe study. Complete demographic data for the 472participating subjects have been previously pub-lished. 2Approximately half were white, married, and younger than 35 years old. Although two thirdshad a college degree, only half had a family income/H11350$39,001; 13% were uninsured. Nearly threequarters were in a monogamous sexual relationship,but subjects reported a mean lifetime number ofsexual partners of 6.3 (SD, 7.7). Twelve percenthad a history of cervical neoplasia.Table 2.

Downloaded from women who felt it was too late for them to get the HPV vaccine were less likely (OR, 0.18; 95% CI,0.08 - 0.44) to want the HPV vaccine than mid-adult women who did not feel it was too late. Discussion We were able to determine several important in-dependent correlates of HPV vaccine acceptanceby mid-adult women. A few might be considereduseful clinical predictors: younger than 55 years ofage and a history of an abnormal Papanicolaou test.This information should be readily available andincluded in any patient's medical record. Our studydemonstrated a positive age correlation for HPVvaccine acceptance even for women 45 to 49 yearsold (OR, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.05-27.68). Whetherwomen older than age 55 would benet from re-ceiving the HPV vaccine is unknown, and it isunlikely a clinical trial will ever address this point.Although off-label administration of the HPV vac-cine is already occurring for women older than 26years, health care providers will need to be pre-pared to vaccinate more \"catch-up\" mid-adultwomen if the Food and Drug Administration ap-proves an extended age indication in a few years.Mid-adult women with a history of an abnormalPapanicolaou test have various motives for wantingthe vaccine. 2From a medical perspective, there are compelling reasons to vaccinate these mid-adultwomen who have demonstrated immunologic vul-nerability. A multivalent vaccine affords future pro-tection against neoplasia caused by all or otherHPV types included in the vaccine, depending onprevious HPV exposure. This primary protection isespecially important for women who are unable toprevent persistent HPV infections and ensuingneoplasia. Mid-adult women opposed to all vaccines were not swayed by the attributes of the HPV vaccinewhen compared with women who wanted to re-ceive any vaccine that would protect them from asexually transmitted infection. A small segment ofthe population refuses any vaccines for a variety ofreasons. 5Exemption from school-based immuniza - tion requirements are granted for religious andpersonal beliefs. 6Because the HPV vaccine will not be mandated for mid-adult women, universal cov-erage is unlikely, which is the case with most othervaccines. Health care providers know who thesenonreceptive women are in their practices. Perhapsan Food and Drug Administration-approved HPV vaccine should be offered to these mid-adultwomen in the future if it is proven safe and efca-cious for this older population. The knowledge that HPV causes cervical cancer and the knowledge of being at risk for HPV infec-tion were positive correlates of HPV vaccine ac-ceptance among mid-adult women. These resultsreinforce the importance of patient education. Assuch, mid-adult women who are aware of thesepotential risks will be more interested in beingvaccinated. Unfortunately, HPV is not one of themore readily recognized sexually transmitted infec-tions. 3,7,8However, many health care providers are sufciently knowledgeable about the risks of HPVto appropriately convey this information to theirpatients. Timely education may help minimize thecost, morbidity, and mortality associated with HPV-related neoplasias. Believing that it is important for their partner and children to receive the vaccine were also posi-tive predictors of HPV vaccine acceptance by mid-adult women. This was particularly true (OR, 25.2;95% CI, 9.66 - 65.72) for the former. Although theFood and Drug Administration has not approvedthe HPV vaccine for use in men yet, many from ourgroup of receptive mid-adult women consideredvaccination of their sexual partner(s) to be veryimportant. Such a vaccination strategy would offerprotection to their partner, but would also indi-rectly help protect them from HPV infection. Mid-adult mothers who want their children to receivethe vaccine are also likely to want the HPV vaccine.Clinicians will need to remain alert to potentiallyvaccinating the entire family in the future. Mid-adult women who considered it too late to receive the HPV vaccine were less likely to want it.In many cases, their assessment is probably correct,particularly for women 50 years of age and older.We did not specically ask women why they thought it was too late. For many, this may be afalse assumption. Simply having a history of anabnormal Papanicolaou test, or even surgery forcervical neoplasia, are not reasons to avoid vacci-nation. Similarly, a history of genital warts in apartner or themselves are not contraindications tobeing vaccinated. Other explanations may includesame-sex relationships, sexual abstinence, and hys-terectomy, but even some of these mid-adultwomen could potentially benet from vaccination. 36JABFM January-February 2008 Vol. 21 No. 1 http://www.jabfm.orgcopyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from Monogamous mid-adult women were also less likely to want to receive the HPV vaccine. Al- though these women perceive themselves not need-ing the vaccine, many may not remain with thesame sexual partner their entire life because ofdivorce, separation, indelity, or death of a spouse.Sexual indelity by a spouse also places the un-knowing monogamous mid-adult woman at risk foracquiring HPV. Obviously, \"catch-up\" vaccination in mid-adult women poses many additional questions. However,this study has identied some useful correlates ofHPV vaccine acceptance that contrast somewhatwith independent predictors of Herpes simplex vi-rus-2 vaccine acceptability ofvaccination, decreased exercise, and reduced alco-hol consumption). 9Given information provided by this trial, clinicians will be better prepared to rec-ognize mid-adult women who are receptive to oropposed to the HPV vaccine. Proper guidanceshould help reduce the risk for mid-adult womendeveloping neoplasias of the lower genital tract. References 1.
