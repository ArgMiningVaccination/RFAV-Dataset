The path to spiritual wellness may be achieved with specific spiritual practices that may include meditation, prayer and affirmations. Having compassion, the capacity for love and forgiveness, alturism, joy and fullfilment can help you to enjoy spitritual wellness. Your religious faith, beliefs, values, principals and morals define your spirituality. All prices are subject to individual specialist My name is Leslie. I am a Reiki Master/Teacher, an Oracle Card reader and a Medium. Helping people is my passion! Reiki is a Japanese technique for relaxation, stress relief and promotes healing. It is administered by the Reiki Practitioner placing their hands in a series of positions across the client's body. It is based on the idea that life force energy flows through us. When our life force energy is low, we are more susceptible to get sick, feel stress and fatigue. When our life force energy is healthy, we are more likely to be happy, well rested and feel less stress. It is my wish to add air under your wings, spring in your step, color in your life, and to inspire you to be your most courageous and creative self. There is only one You! And it is your time to shine. Services at Salt & Sage Spa and Wellness focus on creating a calm, centered, healing space to release, arrive at clarity and re-energize for our future.
