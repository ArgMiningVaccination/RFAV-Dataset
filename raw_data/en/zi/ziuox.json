It can respond with sensitivity to tender contact, allowing us to experience pleasure, or, when harmful influences arise, it can contract or erupt and lead to pain. The increasing prevalence in recent years of various types of skin conditions is an indication that toxic influences are on the increase. A dermatologist, allergist, and physician, Lueder Jachens offers wise advice in Healing the Skin, an expertly written and helpful \"owner's handbook.\" His concern is not only to offer his insights into the individual conditions, their causes, and how best to treat them, but also to present a holistic understanding of the skin itself\u2014the largest human organ\u2014to help us develop better health and harmony in the longer term. Dr. Jachens' authoritative guide begins with an anatomy of the skin and its relationship to the physical and spiritual levels of existence. He then goes on to study various specific conditions and their treatment, including psoriasis, dermatitis, acne, boils, hayfever, fungal infections, herpes, scabies, head lice, sunburn, and much more.
