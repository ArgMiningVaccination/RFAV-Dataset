Isn't it amazing nobody has ever done that study?? Executive summary The medical community has been lying to you about the cause of autism for over 35 years. They said vaccines don't cause autism. [They cite 164 studies showing no link](https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/autism-and-vaccines-150-peer-reviewed-articles-no-link/) between vaccines and autism. That's bullshit. Why it is harder than hell to find an unvaccinated child with autism. If the papers are right, the Amish should have exactly the same rate of autism as the rest of America. But they don't. The rate of autism is near zero. I'm going to bust the \"vaccines don't cause autism\" myth in this article and you are going to see this for yourself in a way that Gorski and his friends who maliciously manipulate poll results cannot stop. Want to see how I'm going to do that? The method I've never heard of a child who developed autistic behavior right before their vaccine appointment. I heard PLENTY of stories of kids who developed autistic behaviors right after the appointment. If you are an autistic parent, do a parent poll on your Facebook autism group that looks something like this: After you get more than 500 votes, please take a screenshot of the poll, post to twitter, then in the comments post a link to the Twitter post with the screenshot. If we get everyone to do this, we'll have dozens of unique data points to look at. We'll see which hypothesis fits the data the best. Summary Let's make it CRYSTAL clear to the world what the truth is. Create a survey similar to the above in your autism group Take a screenshot of the poll after 500 votes. Post a link to the screenshot in the comments, replying to the pinned post This fraud has been going on for 35 years. With your help, we can put a stop to it that makes it obvious to everyone what is going on. It will also expose [all 164 papers as wrong or misleading](https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/autism-and-vaccines-150-peer-reviewed-articles-no-link/). So you'll expose the medical literature as a cesspool of misinformation which should lead to a retraction of all these papers and destroy faith in the medical journals. Isn't that worth a few minutes of "}
