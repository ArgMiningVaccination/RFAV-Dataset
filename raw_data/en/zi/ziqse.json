What Does Detoxify's Herbal Cleansing Line Cleanse? Our proprietary blend of herbal ingredients target different parts of the body and combine to support a [whole-body cleanse ](https://www.detoxify.com/collections/cleanses/products/mega-clean-herbal-cleanse)along with overall health and wellbeing. For example, here are some of the systems that Detoxify targets: - Digestion: Many of Detoxify's herbal cleanse products, including Mighty Clean, Mega Clean, Precleanse Herbal Supplement and Bender Recovery contain Burdock root extract, dandelion extract and juniper extract. Burdock root is high in inulin, making it a common and highly effective digestive aid.1 Dandelion is high in fiber, which is a powerful digestive aid.2 Because of its fiber content, medical professionals have traditionally used dandelion as a treatment for constipation and to improve digestive health. Finally, juniper berry extract has been traditionally used for treating digestive issues, including but not limited to intestinal gas, upset stomach, bloating, loss of appetite and gastrointestinal infections.3 - Urinary: We designed many of our cleanses to target urinary tract issues, which is why they contain ingredients such as burdock root extract, sarsaparilla, stinging nettle and Uva Ursi. Paired with Uva Ursi and dandelion, burdock root is a powerful antioxidant that helps to treat and prevent a number of health conditions, including urinary tract infections. Because sarsaparilla stimulates urine production, it helps flush the system and quickly rid the body of antioxidants.4 Upon its release, it also fights infection and puffiness. Finally, stinging nettle has traditionally been used to relieve common symptoms of urinary tract infections, including incomplete emptying of the bladder, reduced urinary flow and the constant urge to urinate5. - Glucose Metabolism: Many of our customers use our products to speed up glucose metabolism. Our products are effective in this regard thanks to the American ginseng, dandelion and green tea. Recent studies reveal that American ginseng may be effective in supporting healthy glucose metabolism. Because dandelion triggers insulin production, it too supports glucose absorption. Finally, several studies show that green tea helps to reduce blood glucose levels and, at the same time, increase satiety. - Skin: Many of our cleanses don't just support internal health \u2014 they contribute to skin health as well. Several of our products contain milk thistle, which recent studies reveal helps to improve skin conditions and reduce anti-aging effects on the surface.6 Many also contain red clover, which has been proven to boost circulation and, in the process, speed up the body's natural elimination process.7 These effects lead to cleared skin conditions and reduced incidences of psoriasis, eczema and rashes. Sarsaparilla is another common ingredient in our herbal cleanses. Among other health benefits, sarsaparilla contains powerful steroids, several of which help to drastically improve skin lesions in psoriasis patients.8 - Immune System Health: Each one of our full body cleanse products support whole body health in numerous ways. Though we contend that every ingredient in our cleanses supports immune health in various ways, two powerful ingredients \u2014 echinacea and red clover \u2014 are superstars in this regard. The active ingredients in echinacea contain substances that contribute to whole-body health in several ways. For instance, several studies show that echinacea helps to alleviate pain, boost immune system function and reduce inflammation, among other benefits. Likewise, red clover contains high amounts of vitamin C, which contributes to red cell production and, therefore, is a powerful immune system booster.9 - Endocrine: Finally, many of our cleanses contain red clover, which studies show mimics the effects of estrogen.10 As a result, red clover helps to significantly reduce the symptoms of menopause, including night sweats and hot flashes. At Detoxify, we spent substantial time studying herbal remedies and supplements before developing our own proprietary formulas. As a result, each of our cleanses contains nothing but the most powerful ingredients mother nature has to offer. While each cleanse contains a unique blend of ingredients, most contain herbs that support each of the aforementioned systems.
