However, much of the content is also applicable in other settings that deliver education where children and young people require well-being support to fully engage in their learning and to develop. There are a range of intended audiences and partners involved in delivering this Framework, set out on page 11. Overview The Framework is intended to support schools, including pupil referral units (PRUs) and education settings in reviewing their own well-being landscape and in developing plans to address their weaknesses and build on their strengths. It recognises that the school alone cannot meet all the needs of a complex population of children and young people, and sets out the role of regional bodies, the NHS and others such as the third sector, in supporting the school. It is meant to support and complement the new national Curriculum for Wales and in particular the Health and Well-being Area of Learning and Experience. Action required Schools and local authorities are required to have regard to this Framework when developing action plans, strategies and other policies that impact on the well-being of learners, staff and others working within the school environment. In addition, local authorities should have regard to this Framework when organising or delivering educated other than at school (EOTAS) provision.

Ministerial for eword If 2020 has taught us anything , it is the importance of maintaining our emotional and mental well -being. None of us could have foreseen the way COVID -19 would affect our lives and even the most resilient of us will have struggled and experienced poor well-being at times. These are normal emotions and reactions to uncertainty and anxiety about the impact COVID -19 could have on our own health and the health of family and friends ; concerns about its impact on our future, as we witness society change in ways in which we could never have thought possible; w orries a bout having to endure enforced separation from family and friends for long periods ; and sadly , for some of us, having to endure the impact of loss and bereavement as a result of the virus. Thankfully, as we start 2021 with the rollout of the COVID -19 vacc ines, there is hope that at some point in the near future our lives will return to normal. However, it will not be the same and the emotional scars and impact of COVID -19 are likely to remain with us for some time. This will require additional effort from all of us to support and improve the emotional well -being of the individual and the nation. If we can take positives from the last year let it be that the spotlight is now firmly focused on emotional and mental well -being and, in particular, the well -being of children and young people and the role of schools in supporting and building positive well -being. Our children and young people already have so much to cope with, whether it be the stresses of growing up in an uncertain world, added pressures such as family circumstances, poverty, physical and mental impairment, housing, access to transport and facilities which many of us take for granted , or their physical environment . All of these can influence children and young people's emotional and mental well -being. As a result of our cross -governmental strategy Together for Mental Health (2012) we have made good progress in addressing many of the negative factors in recent years and education is playing its part, in particular through development of our new curriculum. The development of 'healthy confident individuals' is one of the four purposes of the new curriculum and the Health and Well -being Area of Learning and Experience is about developing the capacity of learners to navigate life's opportunities and c hallenges. The Welsh Parliament's Children, Young People and Education Committee acknowledges the progress that has been made in its Mind over matter: Two years on 1 (2020) report. This Framework is central to that progress and supports schools, local authorities (LAs) and partners in developing consistent and equitable whole- school approaches to well -being. It builds on the many examples of good practice already occurring across Wales and it is not a standalone document. It is compl emented by the work of the Together for Children and Young People 1 https://senedd.wales/laid%20documents/cr -ld13568/cr -ld13568- e.pdf 4 Programme (T4CYP(2)); 'whole system' approach to children's well -being. This Framework was consulted on between July and September 2020 and 142 responses were received. We want to thank the many respondents from across the spectrum of Welsh life, including the many individual children and young people, parents /carers , teachers and clinicians who responded. You have helped shape the future of well -being provision for children and young people for the better. Kirsty Williams Eluned Morgan Minister for Education Minister for Mental Health , Well- being and the Welsh Language 5 2. Executive s ummary This Framework is issued as statutory guidance to governing bodies of maintained nursery, primary, secondary, middle, pupil referral units ( PRUs ), and special schools and local authorities in Wales. It is also intended for use by the range of partners who work i n and with schools to support the emotional and mental well -being of learners and staff. While written primarily for schools much of the content and the focus on well -being is equally applicable in other settings such as childcare settings that deliver the Foundation Phase, further education (FE) and higher education (HE). It aims to address the emotional and mental well -being needs of all children and young people, as well as school staff , as part of the whole- school community. It also recogni ses that the school alone cannot meet all the needs of what is a complex population of young people, whose needs will vary as they progress through infancy to adolescence and early adulthood. It is not about medicalising well -being ; rather it is about taki ng account of the continuum of need. Primarily it is about building resilience and ensuring preventative action. However, there is also a need to recognise the signs and address poor well -being when it arises and to ensure effective support for schools and the learner when a learner experiences more severe distress. School staff well -being is also central to the F ramework, recognising the link between learner well -being and the well -being of the adults they have frequent contact with. Effective learning is most likely to occur in an environment where all are engaged. The whole- school approach seeks to support good emotional and mental well -being by promoting a positive cultural environment in schools, where children and young people form positive relationships with staff and other learners, and relationships are strengthened: between teaching staff with the school senior leadership team and wider school staff with parents and carers with other profess ionals working with the school with the wider community that surrounds the school. It is about embedding good well -being through teaching as well as all the other aspects of school life. It is an ethos that: values inclusion, where everybody works together, contributing their individual skills and resources to the collective good creat es a supporti ve environment where young people are encouraged to fulfil their personal and academic potential, where they thrive, learn and emotionally develop, suppor ted by teachers who operate in a culture that equally values their own well-being . The Framework places a number of actions and requirements on schools and partners , including the following. 6 All partners/stakeholders involved in the delivery of this Framework should be open and responsive to each other and be clear on their roles and responsibilities in meeting the emotional and mental well -being needs of children. Within the school, delivering the approach involves collaborative and sustainable effort involving all members of the school community; it is the responsibility of the governing body, senior management team, teaching and support staff. Schools, led by the governing body and headteacher, need to make a strong statement that well-being suppor ts academic attainment and wider benefits to community and society, both in the here and now as well as in the future. This should be recognised in schools' developmental plans and relevant documentation. Developing children and young people who have an understanding of their own well-being is an important outcome in itself. Partners/stakeholders should involve and engage children and young people to understand this Framework . Children and young people should have a route to tell partners/stakeholders what they think about the arrangements being put in place and what is important to them within the Framework . While delivering this Framework is everybody's business, school governing bodies and headteachers, particularly in larger schools, should appoint a na med person to lead implementation and act as coordinator to engage with other staff, learners, parents/carers and external agencies. This individual may already have experience of such work in relation to coordinating the Welsh Network of Health School Schemes (WNHSS) activity, or leading pastoral care, for example. This Framework is not intended to be overly bureaucratic (effective implementation and delivery may bring benefits, for instance in teachers feeling more supported in the classroom). Wherever possible, existing delivery mechanisms should be used for delivery of this Framework . In delivering children's and young people's universal and targeted interventions, or any interventions aimed at improving teacher knowledge and understanding of their own and children's well -being, the school's senior leadership team will ensure that only those interventions with a sound or innovative and developing evidence base are delivered. Schools (the whole academic and support staff, led by the senior leadership team) should implement and integrate this Framework , making links with their curriculum . Linked to the school improvement planning cycle, the school's senior leadership team will undertake a review of learners' emotional and mental well -being needs and implement a plan to address issues and build on areas of strength. The school's senior leadership team should engage partners and their learners to keep activity against this Framework under review and in line with the Children and Young People's National Participation Standards 2 and National Principles for Public Engagement in Wales3. Local authorities should have regard to this F ramework when organising or delivering educated other than at school ( EOTAS ) provision. This Framework will be kept under review and evaluated to ensure it is fit for purpose. The first such review will occur during late 2022, taking account of the 2 gov.wales/children- and-young- peoples -national -participation- standards 3 www.participationcymru.org. uk/principles 7 learning arising from having implemented the Framework for a full academic year (2021 -22). Core values The Framework is based on the core values of belonging, efficacy and having your voice heard: Belonging Efficacy Voice School senior leadership team How does your school contribute to a sense of belonging? Do I role model the behaviour I want to see at all levels of the school and build relationships based on respect, trust and fairness ? Do I make space for conversations, giving and receiving constructive feedback, acting on the views of others to help us be at our best more of the time? All staff Am I aware of the well- being needs of my learner s and colleagues ? Do I understand my own well -being needs and the impact my well-being has on those around me? Do I have the time to listen to the young people in my care and advocate for them when needed? Learners Do I feel safe, valued, treated with respect, connected and supported whil e at school? Do I have self -esteem, aspirations, self - confidence and empathy ? Am I able to form and maintain trusting relati onships with peers ? Do I know there are adults I can trust and talk to when I need to? Do I feel supported to speak my mind, safe in the knowledge that my views are given due consideration? Parents/ carers/ family What contribution can I make to both my child and my child's peers ' well-being, both in and outside school? Am I able to positively influence my child in a healthy and success promoting manner and maintain beneficial ties to the school to support and promote wider community benefits ? Do I feel confident and able to raise and discuss issues and know how to navigate a system that works with me to find appropriate support when needed? Delivering the whole -school approach It provides a defined process for schools to develop and embed their own whole- school approaches which is consistent, equitable for learners and staff and which is not intended to be overly bureaucratic, rather working in common with existing school improvement processes. It is about emphasi sing the good things that we should all be doing as a matter of course. 8 The Framework enables schools to scope their need, mapping their strengths and weaknesses, using the range of data they have available to them, including internal and external sources and benchmarking data from schools within their own region. They will be supported by dedicated implementation leads, funded by the Welsh Government and embedded within the WNHSS . The implementation leads are developing an assessment tool to support the process ; it will inform the school 's action plan, build on successes and seek to address gaps. The intention is that this becomes part of continuous improvement, embedded within the school ethos. The action plan will take account of: the whole- school ethos the whole- school curriculum and in particular the Health and Well -being Area of Learning and Experience staff well -being the whole- school school environment the whole- school provision of information, awareness raising and advocacy 9 the whole- school provision of universal and targeted support the whole- school p rovision for children and young people with specific needs the whole- school p rovision for vulnerable children and young people transition between education setting s (i.e. home to school, primary to secondary and school to FE/HE, training or employment ) leadership and staff training. It also considers : how the school works with partners , including the role of youth work the whole system roles and responsibilities relationships with external services , includ ing the work of the T4CYP(2) . In developing this F ramework we are not starting with a blank sheet of paper and there are many examples of good practice across Wales upon which to draw. The Framework includes many case studies of good practice, as well as two examples provided by MIND and The Exchange, in partnership with Swansea LA , of implementing whole- school approaches to help inform activity. Whole system approach In reality , the w hole- school approach is part of a much wider whole- system approach to meeting the well -being needs of children and young people. In this respect it is integral and codependent on the work of the NHS -led T4CYP(2) . T4CYP(2) is a Welsh Government priority with cross -cabinet commitment. It aims to improve the emotional well -being and mental health services/support for children and young people, through coproduction with those with lived experience, their families, communities, NHS health boards, local authorities and the third sector. T4CYP(2) has three areas o f focus: early help and e nhanced support (EHES) neurodevelopmental services Regional Partnership Boards (RPBs) . Evaluation School senior leadership team s should evaluate the effectiveness of their plan as part of wider school improvement to ensure it i s meeting their requirements , involving all parts of the school population of learners and staff in the evaluation. Learners, in particular, should not be considered as passive recipients only, rather they should be seen as valued contributors. As such , they should be involved at the very outset of and throughout the school 's establishment and implementation of its whole- school approach. Estyn's Healthy and h appy (Estyn, 2019) highlights the importance that staff and leaders place on listening to learner s, not just on having systems in place for pupil representation. 10 Governance and accountability The Framework also includes our proposals for g overnance and accountability, reflecting how schools should ensure adherence to the F ramework and how consistency will be ensured at the regional and national levels. 11 3. Intended audience A range of audiences and partners will be involved in delivering this Framework, including : all maintained school senior leadership teams (headteacher s, teacher s-in-charge of PRUs , deputy heads and departmental heads) and wider school staff (teaching, administrative, etc .) governing bodies of maintained nursery, primary, secondary , middle and special schools local authority directorates of education and regional c onsortia local health board primary and secondary care services local authority children's and social services local authority young carers' services parents /carers plus the wider school community youth service s, youth workers , youth offending teams and youth work organisations (both voluntary and LA ) youth offending institutes and secure children's homes local authority Families First l eads childcare settings , especially those that deliver the Foundation Phase playworkers and p lay organisations third sector organisations delivering both early education and education support services children and young people within maintained schools children and young people in EOTAS and PRUs independent schools advocacy providers while not specifically intended for FE and HE , the issues in this document are of equal value in those education setting s and complement existing guidance such as the Public Health Wales Healthy and Sustainable Colleges and Universities Framework4. This document contains both statutory guidanc e and non- statutory advice. The whole of this document is issued as statutory guidance to: governing bodies of maintained nursery, primary, secondary , middle and special schools , as well as of PRUs local authorities in Wales and provides non- statutory advice to other persons , including health professionals, or bodies who may have a role in helping to support the mental health and emotional well-being of learners in maintained schools and other education setting s. 4 www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/documents/888/PHW%20HEFE%20Framework%20bilingual%20October 2019.pdf 12 Local authorities and governing bodies must have regard to this statutory guidance when carrying out their duties in promoting the welfare of children who are learners at the education setting, including meeting their mental and emotional well -being needs. The guidance also applies to activities taking place off -site as part of normal educational activities. Other bodies should have regard to this guidance. What legislation is this guidance issued under? Section 175 of the Education Act 20025 places a duty on local authorities and governing bodies to make arrangements to ensure their functions are exercised with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children in school or another place of learning. This includes supporting the mental health and emotional well - being of lea rners . In meeting the duties under section 175 of the Education Act 2002, local authorities and governing bodies must have regard to guidance issued by the Welsh Ministers under this section. Section 21(5) of the Education Act 2002 places a duty on gover ning bodies to promote the well -being of learners at the school as far as related to the matters mentioned in section 25(2) of the Children Act 2004, which includes physical and mental health and emotional well -being, education, training and recreation, and social well- being. The non -statutory advice contained within this document is issued in exercise of the Welsh Ministers' duty to promote the education of the people of Wales and their power in relation to the promotion or improvement of the economic, social and environmental well -being of Wales . 5 www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/section/175 13 4. Background 4.1 The whole -school approach, and a blended learning approach The coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented situation where, in order to respond to, and where possible mitigate, the public health emergency, significant, complex and often difficult decisions have had to be taken, often within very compressed timescales. Over the course of the last year our understanding of the virus and its longer -term impacts , including the well -being impacts, has continued to develop. The Welsh Government published and has continued to keep under review the Operational guidance for schools and education setting s: Guidance on learning in schools and education setting s: coronavirus 6. This guidance and proposals are in line with the whole- school approach, which in turn supports the well -being response to COVID -19. Whatever the short -, medium - and long -term outcome of the pandemic, there has been a considerable amount of learning that can be adapted to support schools and learners. All children and young people should have access to support for their well -being at school, and also at home when necessary. If a blended learning approach is to become more common , or the preferred option for some learners with specific needs, then it is even more important that maintaining relationships and being able to talk about issues should be possible even when at home. This brings challenges for some, in particular children and young people with additional learning needs (ALN) who face: a lack of contact with their teachers and friends who are important attachment figures changes to routine anxiety about returning to school having to adapt to new rules. This is not only true for learners, but also staff, who may be suffering poor well -being themselves as a result of having to work from home. However, whil e a blended learning approach brings difficulties, there are also benefits. Some groups of learners will have benefitted greatly from a blend ed learning approach , such as those who fall into the category of 'frequent school absences' or those with long-term sickness . With appropriate support and protocols in place, developing blended approaches for some learners with specific needs could be us eful for the long-term. Support and resources for blended learning are available on Hwb 7. 6 gov.wales/guidance- learning- schools -and-settings -coronavirus -html 7 hwb.gov.wales/distance- learning 14 4.2 Purpose This Framework aims to address the emotional and mental well -being needs of all children and young people, as well as school staff as part of the whole- school community . It also recognises that the school alone cannot meet all the needs of what is a complex population of young people, whose needs will vary as they progress through infancy to adolescence and early adulthood. Supporting the well -being of children and young people is everybody's business and we all have a role to play in working with schools to ensure children and young people are able to fulfil their potential. It is not meant to be bureaucratic, building on existing activity and good prac tice wherever possible, with Estyn's Healthy and happy report 8 show ing approximately half of Welsh schools are already engaging in whole- school approaches to some degree. For these schools the Framework will support the process of reviewing and improving w ork that has already occurred. For schools that have yet to embark on the journey, this Framework will support them in developing a culture that support s the well-being of children and young people. The Framework also recognises that learner well-being is impacted by their surroundings and the adults they have contact with, in particular the teachers and other school staff, whose well -being needs require attention as much as their learners . It recognises that effective learning can only occur in an envi ronment where all are engaged and when children are in an emotional state where they are receptive to learning . This Framework provides direction and a template to develop and embed consistent policy and practice within schools and the wider community , underpinned by robust processes, procedures, administrative and governance arrangements to ensure continuity and equity for all. It is underpinned by: our commitment to children's rights , and specifically Article s 12 and 29 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) 9. Article 12 states that children have a right to say what they think should happen when adults are making decisions that affect them, and to have their opinions tak en into account. Article 29 states that a child or young person's education should develop each child's personality and talents to the full. It should encourage children to respect their parents, an d their own and other cultures. The Children's Commissioner has published a guide for schools The Right Way: A Children's Rights Approach for Education in Wales10, which should inform schools' work when embed ding a rights -based approach. Education in Wales: Our national mission11 Enabling objective 3 ( 'Strong and inclusive schools committed to excellence, equity and w ell-being ') recognises that all learners must be supported to be emotionally and physically ready to learn in safe and supportive environments. Every school will implement its new curriculum 8 2022 for learners up to and including Y ear 7. Secondary schools will then roll out their curriculum on a year-on-year basis. Every school's curriculum will need to place health and well -being at its heart ; together with changes in assessment, evaluation and accountability arrangements , it will drive future behaviour , and ensure mental health is given parity with physical health and emotional well -being and attainment . It is further underpinned by the Welsh Government's commitments to children and young people's well -being , set out in a range of legislation and strategy. The key legislative and strategic drivers are out lined in Annex 2. 4.3 Key actions/requirements All partners/stakeholders involved in the delivery of this Framework should be open and responsive to each other and be clear on their roles and responsibilities in meeting the emotional and mental well -being needs of children and young people. Within the school , delivering the whole- school approach involves collaborative and sustainable effort involving all members of the school community; it is the responsibility of the governing body, senior management team, teaching and support staff. Schools , led by the governing body and headteacher, need to make a strong statement that well -being supports academic attainment and wider benefits to community and society, both in the here and now as well as in the future. This should be recognised in their school development plan. Developing children and young people who have an understanding of their own well -being is an important outcome in itself. Partners/st akeholders should involve and engage children and young people to understand this Framework . Children and young people should have a route to tell partners/stakeholders what they think about the arrangements being put in place and what is important to them within the Framework . While delivering this Framework is everybody's business, school governing bodies and headteacher s, particularly in larger schools, should appoint a named person to lead implementation, act as coordinator and engage with other staff, learners , parents/carers and external agencies. This individual may already have experience of such work in relation to coordinating WNHSS activity, or leading pastoral care, for example. This Framework is not intended to be overly bureaucratic (effectiv e implementation and delivery may bring benefits, for instance, in teachers feeling more supported in the classroom). Wherever possible, existing delivery mechanisms should be used for delivery of this Framework . In delivering children's and young people's universal and targeted interventions, or any interventions aimed at improving teacher knowledge and understanding o f their own and children's well -being , the school 's senior leadership team will ensure that only those interventions with a sound or innovative and developing evidence base are delivered. In this respect , the Welsh Government will develop a repository of resources and evidence- based interventions as well as staff continuous professional development resources for adoption by schools to complement this Framework . 16 Schools (the whole academic and support staff, led by the senior leadership team) should implement and integrate this Framework with their curriculum, especially with learning in the Health and Well -being Area of Learning and Experience, to maximise the opportunities they both present and recognise the link between the two. Linked to the school improvement planning cycle, the school 's senior leadership team will undertake a review of their emotional and mental well -being needs and implement a plan to address issues and build on areas of strength. The school 's senior leadership team should engage partners and their learners to keep activity against this Framework under review and in line with the Children and Young People' s National Participation Standards12 and National Principles for Public Engagement in Wales13. This Framework will be kept under review and evaluated to ensure it is fit for purpose. The first such review will occur during late 2022, taking account of the learning arising from having implemented the Framework for a full academic year (2021 -22). More generally , the Welsh Government has commissioned Cardiff University to consider the short -, medium - and long -term evidence to help inform evaluation. 4.4 Context This Framework is underpinned by a rights -based approach that aims to achieve a positive transformation of power by strengthening the capacity of duty bearers and empowering the rights holders. The UNCRC is a legally binding international agreement , embedded by the Welsh Government in legislation, setting out the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of every child, regardless of their race, religion or abilities. In particular: Article 6 , which recognises that all children and young people have the right to survive and the right to develop Article 12 , which states that children have a right to say what they think should happen when adults are making decisions that affect them, and to have their opinions tak en into account Article 24 , which says that healthcare for children and young people should be as good as possible, but also goes further than this by saying children and young people have the right to be both physically and mentally fulfilled Article 29 , which says that a child or young person's education should help their mind, body and talents be the best they can. It should also build their respect for other people and the world around them. In particular, they should learn to respect their rights and the rights of others. The World Health Organisation defines health as 'a state of complete physical, mental and social well -being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity'. It further defines mental health as 'a state of well -being in which every individual realises his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work 12 gov.wales/children- and-young- peoples -national -participation- standards 13 www.participationcymru.org.uk/principles 17 productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community'14. Mental well-being includes our emotional, psychological and social well-being . It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others and make choices. In relation to schools the World Health Organi sation defines a health- promoting school as one that constantly strengthens its capacity as a healthy setting for living, learning and working15. Approximately 1 in 10 children between the ages of 5 and 16 have a mental health problem and many more have behavioural issues . Approximately 50 per cent of people with enduring mental health problems wil l have symptoms by the time they are 14 , and many at a much younger age 16. However, this belies the scale of poor mental well-being among children and young people and most of the emotional issues young people and school staff will encounter are not clinical in nature and do not require specialist interventions. Rather , it is about supporting the young person, building their resilienc e and fostering a sense that there is someone they can trust. Developing these trusting relationships is central to the whole- school approach. Developing positive relationships between a teacher and learner is a fundamental aspect of quality learning and teaching . The effects of teacher -learner relationships have been researched extensively, and point to how positive relationships can have good social and academic outcomes. Being taught by highly trained, highly motivated , trauma -informed teachers who are aware of the impact they have on the young person's overall development , inside and outside the classroom , is central to promoting emotional and mental well -being . The whole- school approach recognises the complexity of managing school emotional well-being, e.g. teaching young people to : understand their own emotions and how they can adapt and cope with the challenges they will face manage low-level short -term challenges such as exam stress manag e some extremely challenging and complex situations such as parental ill health, substance misuse, caring responsibilities, life events and unexpected events. It is important that school s can provide a place where adults , children and young people work together to overcome challenges. Children and y oung people w ill experience many different relationships throughout their formative years , whether they be short -lived friendships, ones that have been built on trust over a number of years , or ones that will continue to grow throughout their adult lives. School life c an and should be challenging and for a child or young person having at least one strong relationship, someone they trust, some one who is more experienced and who they feel has their interests at heart is paramount to not just their academic achievement, but also their social development. 14 www.who.int/features/factfiles/mental_health/en/ whole- school approach seeks to support good emotional and mental well-being by strengthening the relationship( s) between: teacher and learner teaching staff the school senior leadership team and wider school staff the school and parents and carers the school and other professionals working with the school the school and the wider community that surrounds the school. With the school as the hub and centre of community life there is much strong work upon which to build th e whole- school approach - no teacher enters the profession because they do not care about children and young people. This approach builds resilience17 among young people; it focuses on prevention and early intervention when required. When more targeted ap proaches are needed to tackle existing or developing poor emotional and mental well-being , then services work together in a timely fashion to provide appropriate interventions. The whole- school approach is about : embedding good well -being through teaching as well as all the other aspects of school life an ethos that values inclusion, where everybody works together, contributing their individual skills and resources to the collective good creating a supporting environment where young people are encouraged to fulfil their personal and academic potential, where they thrive, learn and emotionally develop, supported by teachers who operate in a culture that also values teachers' own well -being incorporat ing and building on existing good practice in the field such as the WNHSS 18 incorporat ing the work of others such as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS ), which has traditionally offered assessment, treatment and interventions , and which should now be viewing the child and their needs more holistically. Considerable work has also taken place in recent years in relation to the impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which has been built on in education by the ACE Support Hub 19, which has equipped teachers and other school staff with the tools to identify and address the impact of ACEs. In particular , Public Health Wales explores the impact of adults on children and young people in the 2018 report on ACEs 20. The report highlights that 'having at least one trusted, stable and supportive 17www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/documents/888/ACE%20%26%20Resilience%20Report%20%28Eng_fi nal2%29.pdf 18 www.publichealthnetwork.cymru/en/social -determinants/education/welsh- 19 www.aceawarewales.com/about 20 www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/documents/888/ACE%20&%20Resilience%20Report%20(Eng_final2).pd f 19 relationship with an adult is emerging as one of the most important aspects of childhood resilience' . This is reinforced through ACE Support Hub training in education settings , which forms a foundation upon which to build whole- school approaches. Well-being is also about recognising neurodiversity , a fairly new term that recognises the fact that our brains (neuro- ) naturally vary from person to person (are diverse). It moves away from medical words such as 'disorder', 'disability' and 'difficulty'. Instead of just looking at what someone struggles with, it encourages us to think about them as a whole. What are they good at? What do they need support with? Neurodiversity means talking people and pathways, not labels and silos and considers the person in the context of their lives, past and present. 4.5 Importance of good emotional and mental health and emotional well-being Numerous studies show that education and mental well -being are closely linked and promoting the health and well -being of learners within schools can positively impact learner cooperation, commitment, learning and engagement21. This means having a school culture, ethos and environment that nurtures learners' health and well -being can improve learners' educational outco mes. Equally , the relationship between physical and mental health cannot be understated - physical health problems significantly increase the risk of poor mental well-being , and vice versa22. Good emotional and mental well -being allows children and young people to develop the resilience to cope better with the challenges they face, and grow into well - rounded, healthy adults. Things that can help keep children and young people of all ages mentally and emotionally well and resilient include: being listened to, feeling valued, respected and known as individuals being in good physical health, eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise having time and the freedom to play, indoors and outdoors being part of a family that gets along well most of the time going to a school that looks after the well -being of all its learner s taking part in local activities for young people. Other factors are also important, including: feeling loved, trusted, understood, valued and safe being mot ivated and interested in life and having opportunities to enjoy themselves being hopeful and optimistic 21 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/37 0686/HT_briefing_layoutvFINALvii.pdf 22 www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/time- think -differently/trends -disease -and-disability -mental -physical - health 20 being able to learn and having opportunities to succeed accepting who they are and recognising what they are good at having a sense of belonging in thei r family, school and community feeling they have some control over their own life having the strength to cope when something is wrong or challenging (resilience) and the ability to solve problems. There are certain risk factors that make some children and young people more likely to experience problems than other children. These factors do not occur in isolation and an individual may experience several at any given time; they carry varying degrees of risk, can be short - or long -term, and some are more comm on than others . They include (the following is not an exhaustive list) : having a long -term physical illness or disability having a parent /carer who has had mental health problems, problems with alcohol , substance misuse or is/has been within the criminal justice system . In addition to affecting the young person's own well -being, this could also lead to stigma and discrimination experiencing the death of someone close to them having parents /carers who are in conflict having been bullied having been physically or sexually abused living in poverty being homeless experiencing domestic violence and neglect experiencing discrimination, perhaps because of their race, sexuality , gender or religion having an additional learning need acting as a carer for a relative, taking on adult responsibilities having long -standing educational difficulties as a result of being in care or on the edge of care being subject to many changes , trauma or ACEs experiencing loneliness and isolation experience of care. The Welsh Government publishes information annually on the number of children and young people presenting to independent counselling services 23. On average, the service sees around 11,500 children and young people each year and figures have not fluctuated significantly in several years . The top presenting issues have consistently related to family, anxiety, stress and anger, reflecting a trend in well - being among these young people. Many of these issues are not clinical in nature and did not require clinical interventions, with very few of the young people requiring any onward referral to more specialist services. Children and young people face many of the challenges adults face on a day -to-day basis. However, unlike adults who often have the experience and resilience to overcome their challenges, children and young people often lack the experience, maturity and ability to place their challenges in 23 statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Education- and-Skills/Schools -and-Teachers/Counselling- for- Children- and-Young- People 21 context . They are also unable to di rectly control certain aspects of their lives or to cope well when things go wrong . Minor issues can seem like potentially life- changing events for young people. Therefore, having a trusted adult who they c an talk to and who could provide an appropriate empathetic response and place their problems into context will be enough in many cases. 4.6 Review and implementation The Welsh Government is considering how best to measure the short -, medium - and long-term progress in this field and has started by commissioning Car diff University to undertake an evaluability ass essment. This will: develop an evidence- based theory of change that articulates how inputs will result in the intended impacts of the w hole- school approach ensure key stakeholders (including children and young people) contribute to the evaluability assessment determine the extent to which the implementation and impact of the whole- school approach can be effectively evaluated identify the research and data- gathering activities required for effective evaluation. This is a long -term piece of work that will con sider the full br eadth of whole- school - related policy . We will also consider separate arrangements to measure the specific appropriateness and impact of t he implementation and application of this Framework and supporting activity . This will ensure schools and their partners are adhering to the Framework , that it is being consistently implemented across Wales , and that it is fit for purpose. To ensure this we will work with partners to specifically review implementation of the Framework during autumn/winter 2022; this will ensure we are able to consider activity that spans one full academic year ( 2021- 22). 22 5. Introduction and application 5.1 Overarching principles All children in Wales have rights under the UNCRC to be safe, to be treated with equality and non- discrimination, to be supported to develop their physical and mental health, to express their thoughts and feelings, to be involved in decisions made about them, to receive extra support if they are disabled, and to receive an education that enables them to f ulfil their potential. A whole- school approach should be viewed as central to the success of learning about health and well -being and the four purposes of the new curriculum . The responsibility for all school staff to take a whole- school approach to the promotion of good mental health and emotional well -being is universal and integral to a successful school environment. However, each school is different and will face different challenges, so there is no one- size-fits-all approach. The school 's senior leadership team will use this Framework to help assess where they need to do more and adopt practice that meets their specific needs. A whole- school approach to emotional and mental well-being is achievable through effective leadership, positive culture and co- productive implementation in partnership with all school stakeholders, ranging from governors and heads to learners , from teaching and support staff to auxiliary staff such as cleaners, caretakers and canteen staff. A whole- school approach that puts the child at the centre of decisions made about them needs partnership and involvement with families, the community, other statutory bodies and the third sector. Activity within t he school is part of a wider whole- system approach to emotional and ment al well-being . School staff can therefore be expected to do only what is within their competence and resource. A whole- school approach promot es equity for all, reducing variation and us ing evidence- based practices consistently and transparently, in terms of both use of data for planning and any interventions. 5.2 Values The whole- school approach is based on the core values of belonging, efficacy and having your voice heard. These dictate the school ethos and the behaviours expected of the whole school population, apply ing equally to all, not just the learner . Considering the well -being of the school in the context of the core val ues will help the senior leadership team determine if they are on the right path and meeting their well-being goals. The ques tions/statements under each heading (belonging, efficacy, voice) are not to be answered solely by the individual concerned, but in partnership with others. For instance, a school senior leadership team may feel that they 'make space for conversations, givi ng and receiving constructive feedback, acting on the views of others to help us be at our best more of the time', but the experience of teachers, staff and learners in the school may be different. It should form the basis for an honest and open discussion and evaluation. It should not be seen by schools as a 'tick box exercise' ; rather it should help schools to consider health and well- being in their own local context , thinking about both the positives and the areas for improvement , and consider ing how best to develop and express them through policy and practice . 23 Belonging Efficacy Voice School senior leadership team How does your school contribute to a sense of belonging? Do I role model the behaviour I want to see at all levels of the school and build relationships based on respect, trust and fairness ? Do I make space for conversations, giving and receiving constructive feedback, acting on the views of others to help us be at our best more of the time? All staff Am I aware of the well-being needs of my learner s and colleagues ? Do I understand my own well -being needs and the impact my well-being has on those around me? Do I have the time to listen to the young people in my care and advocate for them when needed? Learners Do I feel safe, valued, treated with respect, connected and supported whil e at school? Do I have self - esteem, aspirations, self-confidence and empathy ? Am I able to form and maintain trusting relationships with peers ? Do I know there are adults I can trust and talk to when I need to? Do I feel supported to speak my mind safe in the knowledge that my views are given due consideration? Parents/ carers/ family What contribution can I make to both my child and my child's peers ' well- being, both in and outside school? Am I able to positively influence my child in a healthy and success promoting manner and maintain beneficial ties to the school to support and promote wider community benefits ? Do I feel confident and able to raise and discuss issues and know how to navigate a system that works with me to find appropriate support when needed? 5.3 Local and regional support The whole s chool population needs to be supported in developing their whole- school approach; additionally, as our n ational mission states, local authorities and regional consortia have an important role to play in co -constructing policies, coordinating services, mapping provision and delivering professional development opportunities with other key stakeholders. Specifically , local authorities can support implementation of the whole- school and system approach by: 24 providing guidance on promoting an emotional and mental well -being -friendly environment, including advice on early intervention and prevention and good practice models mapping services and provision that support mental health and emotional well - being within a local authority footprint providing, in collaboration, clarity on relationships and protocols with other agencies, particularly health, social care and the police, and acting as a source of support for schools with concerns and issues over implementation ensuring in reference to key partner agencies that resources, financial and otherwise, are strategically managed to maximise thei r impact on learner s' mental health and emotional well -being needs supporting the school 's senior leadership team to evaluate their learning environments and practice in the context of mental health and emotional well - being as well as to fully include learners in this process working with other key agencies to monitor local practice and provision, including the evaluation quantitative and qualitative information relating to emotional health and well-being representing schools' interests at a local level through relevant strategic boards such as p ublic services boards ( PSBs ) or RPBs to ensure that all key stakeholders and partner agencies are aware of and work together to address issues and provide a whole- system approach supporting the commissioning of statutory and third sector providers of emotional well-being support and advice to work with schools (individually and on a cluster basis), ensuring robust evidence- based interventions are available to support implementation of a school's curriculum; and support learner and staff well -being facilitating access to the broad range of expertise within the local authority and its partners, including services like educational psychologists, y outh workers, school -based counsellors, H ealthy Schools practitioners, advisory teachers, safeguarding teams , behaviour support services and social workers developing and commissioning a range of support at different levels , such as preventative, universal or targeted services for all young people interpret ing data to inform practice such as the School Health Research Network (SHRN) 24 data and vulnerability tools identify ing those learner s in need of targeted intervention, including through successful approaches like the Youth engagement and progression framework , ensuring the interventions are those most appropriate to the learner support ing school leaders by promoting collaboration between schools , with schools benefit ing from a system of sharing practices, experiences and resources support ing the whole school community (and not just learners) demonstrati ng good practice themselves, leading by example by establishing a statement of well -being and reflecting and assessing their own workplace well - being needs . Specifically , regional consortia can be commissioned by local authorities to support implementation of the whole- school and system approach by: 24 The School Health Research Network: www.shrn.org.uk/ 25 supporting school and education setting -based staff's professional development in relation to health and well -being and supporting curriculum development supporting consistent professional learning and continuous improvement opportunities not only for teachers, but all layers of school and education setting staff, minimising duplication of effort and achieving economies of scale supp orting governing bodies to understand their role and responsibilities in relation to learners' health and well -being providing expertise for schools on mental health and well -being , including sharing best practice and coordination of training providing necessary challenge and support in meeting schools' mental health and well-being goals. 5.4 Application in EOTAS and PRUs EOTAS is education provision other than at school funded and organised or delivered by local authorities. EOTAS is designed to meet the specific needs of pupils who, for whatever reason, cannot attend a mainstream or special school. Local authorities have a duty to ensure EOTAS learners have a suitable education or, where a learner attends a PRU, receives a balanc ed and broadly based curriculum. There are diverse reasons why learners do not attend a mainstream school and are in receipt of EOTAS. These include having an illness (physical and mental), refusing to attend school (school phobic) , hav ing challenging behaviour associated with social , emotional and behavioural difficulties (SEBD), and being or at risk of being excluded from school. For some children in EOTAS, the structure of the mainstream school does not enable them to receive their education in a w ay best suited to their individual needs. EOTAS learners are some of our most vulnerable children and young people. A significant number have special educational needs and can come from challenging backgrounds . As a result of the difficulties they have experienced attending mainstream education, EOTAS learners have often missed extended periods of education and have gaps in their learning , can have low self -esteem and lack confidence, and m any have low aspirations for their future. However, we know from evidence that EOTAS provision has a positive impact on the well -being of learners . Research published by Welsh Government in 2013 25, found that learners felt EOTAS had a positive effect on their self -esteem, as well as on their relationships with their schoo l, teachers and families . Local authorities should have regard to this F ramework when organising or delivering EOTAS en.pdf 26 5.5 Application in relation to elective home education The UNCRC guarantees every child the right to grow up healthy, happy and safe. The well -being and safety of all children and young people should be of the utmost importance to all involved wherever they are educated and with support provided to parents and carers who have prime responsibility for this. All agencies an d staff working with families and young people should have regard to this F ramework and should offer advice and signpost them to age -appropriate education resources that encourage resilience and well -being , and can reduce the risk of harm. This includes ensuring families and children and young people access to support services such as local authority independent counselling support. 5.6 Application in e arly years settings Local authorities have a duty to provide at least 10 hours of early education provision - Foundation Phase Nursery (FPN) - from the term after a child's third birthday. Provision can be delivered in maintained nurseries, normally attached to schools, stand- alone maintained n ursery schools or in independent or third sector childcare settings (non- maintained settings) funded to deliver the Foundation Phase curriculum. We know the early years are crucial to the development of every child. Ensuring their emotional well -being is fostered as early as possible wi ll ensure our children and young people are more resilient in the future; the Foundation Phase curriculum has been developed with a specific focus on effectively support ing a child's well- being to enhance and unlock learning . Not all our learners are in schools; some of our youngest receive their early education in non- maintained childcare setting s and it is essential that all children, whether they access education provision or not, feel safe, happy and supported. All practitioners working with parents /carers and young children, whether in the maintained or non- maintained sector , should be e mpowered to offer advice and relevant support as well as encouraged and supported to apply this Framework . 5.7 Meeting the needs of Welsh language and others for whom English is not their first language Cymraeg 2050: A million Welsh speakers (2017)26 is the Welsh Ministers' strategy for the promotion and facilitation of the use of the Welsh language. Receiving services through the medium of Welsh is a matter of need for many Welsh speakers and it is important that this need is met as a natural part of education and providing care and support. Some people with emotional and mental well -being issues ar e particularly vulnerable because their care can suffer if they are not treated in their own language. It is important to remove from the user the responsibility to ask for services through the medium of Welsh , and ensure instead that the service offer s them. This principle is 26 gov.wales/cymraeg- 2050- welsh -language- strategy 27 known as the 'active offer'. Moving towards a more proactive approach to language need and choice may take time and will be dependent upon the availability of Welsh-speaking staff , but mental health services is one priority area where this should happen. It is vital that there is parity of provision in both languages in line with the requirements of the Welsh Language Standards 27 and that provision should reflect the linguistic nature of the school and its catchment area. For many , Welsh is their everyday working language. Schools should ensure that interventions are available in Welsh and should consider the language preference of their learners when developing interventions and support. It would also be beneficial for Welsh- medium training opportunities and support in the workplace to be readily available. In line with the requirements of the Equality Act 2010, refugees, asylum seekers and other minority groups, such as immigrant and traveller communities, should also not be discrimin ated against due to a lack of knowledge of English. It is important to ensure that resources are accessible to people for whom neither English nor Welsh is their first language. This is particularly true considering minority groups tend to be more adversely impacted by mental health. Access to language support, both orally and in writing, is essential to ensure that learners and their parents/carers understand the advice and support available. Schools wil l have clear protocols and policies in place to ensure the needs of learners for whom English is not their first language are met. 27 gov.wales/welsh -language -standards -regulations 28 Flow diagram illustrating process for embedding a whole -school approach to mental health and emotional well -being The flow diagram outlines the process a school 's senior leadership team will follow in implementing their whole- school approach es, having regard to the overarching principles and values . The process will not be completed overnight and will require space and ti me. Changing things can feel risky for managers, staff and learners, but small changes create confidence to embark further on the journey towards a whole-school approach in which every action considers the well -being of all. It is not meant to be over -burdensome but is intended to provide some consistency and equity of provision across Wales, building on the requirements of the new curriculum. A number of vehicles already exist that support activity and can be used to take forward the requirements of this Framework , such as the WNHSS and the work of the ACE Support Hub. 29 Step 1 6. Scoping stage The planning process needs to start with a school 's senior leadership team (engaging with the wider school community and external partners ) assessment of the school's emotional and mental health needs - the local 'landscape'. It should highlight the school 's gaps in provision as well as their strengths (which can be built upon further). Measuring and assessing well -being is complex , with the mental health and emotional well-being of children and young people frequently chang ing throughout the course of their lives. In particular, during secondary school there are some dramatic changes in children's well -being , self -reported health and lifestyles. This illustrates the importance of assessing emotional and mental well -being using a range of sources to gain a robust evaluation that reflects all the needs of the school community. This stage should also include consideration of staff well -being ; the school's senior leadership team should utilise a range of data sources to assess their own needs and strengths , triangulating these to ensure findings are robust. 6.1 Evaluation Effective self -evaluation is at the centre of creating a school as a learning organisation and supporting improvement. In Wales, we are placing robust self - evaluation at the heart of our new evaluation and improvement arrangements. Scho ol leaders, teachers, local authorities and regional consortia should use self - evaluation to drive improvements that help to achieve the four purposes for children and young people, with learning and well -being at the heart of the school's curriculum. 6.1.1. Self-evaluation Given the importance of self -evaluation, the Welsh Government is developing a national evaluation and improvement resource to support schools in undertaking robust, enquiry -based self -evaluation. The national evaluation and improvement resource will provide schools with a range of principles and approaches, as well as practical case studies and resources, to support effective self -evaluation. It does not prescribe a particular approach, and school s are encouraged to make use of the resource to develop their approaches to self -evaluation, selecting the most suitable tools or approaches in the resource to adapt and use in their own context. The national resource has not been developed as a stand- alone resource. There are significant links across self -evaluation relating to curriculum development, pedagogy, professional learning, the well-being of learners and staff, and the schools as learning organisations model. All schools will also be entitled t o professional learning from regional consortia that builds their capacity to improve. This is likely to include 30 their self -evaluation arrangements and their use of enquiry -based approaches for monitoring and evaluation. The resource will support schools to engage in evidence- based self -evaluation of what is working well and what they need to improve in order to have a greater positive impact on the well -being of learners. Through self -evaluation, schools will identify their improvement priorities, inclu ding well-being. Once identified, school improvement priorities will be drawn together in a single, strategic school development plan, helping to reduce workload, streamline schools' strategic planning processes and avoid unnecessary duplication and bureaucracy. Schools should publish a summary of their development plan. As the accountable bodies for their schools, governing bodies will monitor the delivery of the development plan, taking action where progress against improvement priorities is unsatisfactor y. Some schools will also identify well -being as a particular strength as part of their self - evaluation processes. In these cases regional consortia will assess whether these schools have capacity to support other schools, and may facilitate school -to-school working and collaboration, as part of a self -improving system. 6.2 Direct observations and people's views School s' senior leadership teams are able to access data and intelligence on well - being needs through direct observation and through gatheri ng people's views . Direct observations can take place across various leaning contexts, both inside and outside of the classroom. Key stakeholders including staff, parents/carers, learners and governing bodies should all receive regular opportunities to share their views. Examples of how views can be gathered include discussions with parents/carers on their child's progress, specific focus groups with parents /carers or learner s, staff feedback, or as part of lessons working with learner s to develop questionn aires and surveys to capture their views. Another important source of observation is provided by Estyn evaluations . 6.2.1 Estyn evaluations Estyn will continue to undertake school inspections and thematic reviews of activity, such as the Healthy and h appy report 28 which, among other things, evaluates how well primary and secondary schools in Wales support the health and well-being of learner s. School inspections will continue to assess the contribution of each school to the well -being of its learner s - the extent to which learner s feel safe and secure and how well they are becoming healthy, confident individuals who understand how to make healthy choices in a range of areas. Inspectors will continue to assess how schools track and monitor learner s' well-being, and determine how successful a school's provision is in helping learner s to understand the impact of lifestyle choices 28 www.estyn.gov.wales/thematic -report/healthy behaviours on their present and future mental and physical health and well - being . 6.3 Quantitative data There is a range of quantitative data sources, both internal and external, that a school's senior leadership team may wish to use during the scoping stage. These include the following. 6.3.1 School Health Research Network (SHRN) data Learner s in maintained seco ndary schools in Wales currently complete the bilingual, electronic Student Health and Well -being (SHW) Survey every two years. This survey forms a key part of the work of the SHRN, of which all secondary schools in Wales now participate. The student level is compl emented by a School Environment Questionnaire, which the senior leadership team in all schools complete on health- related policies and practices. Schools that join the SHRN and collect data receive an individualised SHW r eport , based on learner responses to the SHW Survey. These reports provide member schools with data on key mental and emotional , and physical health topics , with national data for comparison. Case study : Bassaleg School29 - using data provided by the SHRN to support a whole -school approach to health and well -being In response to the new curriculum, Bassaleg School have used a whole- school, evidence- based and learner -voice led approach to develop new teaching practices that prioritise mental health and well-being. This involved a distributed leadership approach that included staff and pupils using their 2017 SHW report to audit their curriculum and revise teaching practices. Their revised t utor programme was described by Estyn as 'outstanding', 'transf ormational' and 'well -being standards for health and well-being and assistant headteacher asked all form super visors to develop a bespoke tutor programme provision plan based on the needs identified in their SHW report. For example , they identified as an area of concern the proportion of students in Year 10 that engaged in sexting ; thus, as a preventative measure, this topic is now considered with Year 9 learners. The present tutor programme that takes place every morning for 25 minutes now functions as an extension of the personal and social education (PSE) programme by covering topics such as mental health, resilience and LGBT + diversity. Bassaleg also established a Health and Well -being Area of Learning and Experience programme f or Year 7 learners , again planned as a result of the data in their SHW report. Lessons cover three main topic areas, including nutrition, fitness and w ell- 29 www.estyn.gov.wales/effective- practice/using- school -programmes -support -equality -and-diversity 32 being, which are delivered at least once every fortnight and include an assessment at the end of each term. Assessments are based on the Literacy and Numeracy Framework. The numeracy assessment of these projects includes the use of Bassaleg's SHW data, e.g. the graph depicting the proportion of students who usually eat breakfast every weekday is used to encourage learners to discuss the importance of breakfast. These tasks not only raise learners ' awareness of diff erent health and well -being topics, but also help develop their data analysis and interpretation skills. As a self -evaluation tool to measure whether the changes they have implemented throughout the school have had a positive effect , Bassaleg are now comparing their 2017 and 2019 SHW Survey results to measure the impact the different interventions have had. This information will be used to update and tailor the existing f orm tutor programme as well as to shap e the new Year 8 Health and Well -being curriculum. 6.3.2 School -based management and regional data Schools collect a range of data and intelligence, which can be used to inform and under stand the well -being both of the learner s and the school staff. This includes information on absence rates and on exclusions , as well as intelligence obtained through discussion with other professionals such as e ducational psychologists. However, caution needs to be exercised, as although data could be appropriately used to identify learners requiring extra help, it should not be used to attempt to 'diagnose' an individual's specific needs. Where specific concerns do exist, these should be discussed with t he relevant specialists and referrals made as appropriate. 6.3.3 Welsh Network of Health School Schemes (WNHSS) The majority of schools are already actively involved with the WNHSS , which supports schools to work towards the Welsh Government 's National Quality Award using a whole- school approach to health and well -being. Healthy Schools practitioners support schools in action- planning to address health and well -being needs and are currently focusing on supporting mental well -being and physical activity , as well as infection prevention and control in response to the pandemic. In addition , the Welsh Government has agreed to support implementation of this Framework by funding dedicated i mplementation leads in each regional area/local health board area. The implementation leads will: provide capacity to support their multi -agency local partnership through d irectors of public health to help implement the whole- school approach in their areas provide additional capacity to the workforce for a whole- school approach to mental health mobilise the wider whole- school approach workforce in each area to support schools to undertake an assessment and support them to develop implementation plans for their WSAMH. 33 The implementation leads will work with existing key stakeholders to support schools in undertaking a baseline assessment and in developing an initial improvement plan/set of actions in relation to WSAMH. 6.3.4 Local a uthority activity Local authorities can also provide benchmarking data , which compares in formation on a range of like schools or a cluster of closely geographically located schools. They can also provide wider information that should inform planning such as local area needs assessments. Local authorities, regional consortia and other partners (such as the WNHSS) should work with a school 's senior leadership team and their partners to ensure that they are aware of the range of data sources available to them . They should also work with the school 's senior leader ship team to develop more robust data sets that profile community -based needs and inform the interventions and strategies employed by schools. Other sources of well-being information could also come from agencies such as the Youth Service, p olice and youth justice teams. Case study : Y Pant Comprehensive School 30 Y Pant Comprehensive School carries out a well -being audit regularly, which the school created themselves using free software. This audit gives every learner a valuable opportunity to share how they feel about themselves, their relationships and their progress in school. This is used by staff alongside other information about learner s, such as their attendance and behaviour, to identify those who may benefit from additional support. 30 www.estyn.gov.wales/thematic -report/healthy -and-happy -school -impact -pupils -health- and- wellbeing 34 Step 2 7. Action plan and implementation Schools already produce development plans31 that provide a strategic blueprint for improvement. The development plan sets out the actions a school will take to improve learner outcomes. It is informed by continuous self -evaluation and contextualised information and evidence (e.g. from SHRN), and contains the school's improvement priorities together with short -term and longer -term targets. It sets out how the school will achieve its targets in relation to its priorities and how it will u se the resources it has available, including funding. It must also set out how the school intends to develop its staff. It is a live document that should be continuously refreshed to reflect the school's progress in meeting its priorities, taking account o f the range of qualitative and quantitative data. Schools that identify emotional and mental well -being as improvement priorit ies should include these in their development plan with appropriate actions and milestones. The actions and milestones should be informed by the requirements of this Framework to ensure consistency of provision. The plan should be informed by the findings of the school needs assessment , which is a process to help focus ideas and to decide what steps need to be taken to achieve the w hole- school approach. Where schools identify strengths in relation to well -being they should also consider how these can be built upon to further embed a whole- school approach, as well as where they may be able to support other schools. School senior leaders should undertake a holistic approach to ensuring the well - being requirements of all learner s and staff are met , and should consider this as part of their planning process. 7.1 School ethos The Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD)32 identifies the following four key broad areas that influence learner well-being : psychological - learner s' life satisfaction, sense of purpose, self -awareness and absence of emotional problems physical - learners ad opting a healthy lifestyle, and learner s' overall health social - learner s' relationships with family, peers and teachers, and learner s' feelings about their social life cognitive - learner s' proficiency in applying what they know to solve problems. An emotionally and mentally healthy school is one that adopts a whole- school approach to well -being ; this helps children flourish, learn and succeed by providing 31 gov.wales/site 35 opportunities for both them and the adults around them to develop the strengths and coping skills that underpin resilience. A mentally healthy school sees positive mental health and emotional well -being as fundamental to its values, mission and culture33. A whole- school approach involves all parts of the school working together and being committed. It needs partnership working between governors, senior leaders, teachers and all school staff, as well as parents /carers and the wider community. The whole- school approach needs to be embedded in a school's culture and ethos and has a significant impact on learner s' health and well -being as it influences their sense of belonging and value. Learner s expect school to be a safe and secure place, where they are valued equally and respected, and where their rights are promoted and upheld 34. The key points can be summarised as follows - the school's senior leadership team should ensure: the school takes a holistic approach to supporting good mental health, which is seen as everybody's business the school support s every member of staff, including non- teaching staff, to work with learner s in a nurturing way, treating learner s with respect the school has in place appropriate policies or practices that actively promote and enhance well-being , such as ensuring appropriate levels of homework the school' s behavioural and other policies should contain positive messages about the importance of learner well-being all aspects of the school day contribute to t he sense of good well -being from arrival, through lessons and play/break times , to departure. The Estyn Healthy and happy report highlighted that the best schools are proactively positive with learner s, greeting learner s by name, smiling, providing a reass uring presence and quickly identifying anyone who may benefit from additional support learner feedback is actively encouraged and given due consideration learner s are encouraged to work in partnership, moving from being competitive to collaborative parents/carers are seen as equal partners and are encouraged to engage in the school community. If parents/carers understand what is being taught in the classroom there is potential for them to transfer this to the home environment, reinforcing and bui lding on the school's good work. In this respect , activity is already underway with the ACE Support Hub looking to extend activity to early years, pre- school, the foundation phase, parents /carers and the wider communities around schools. 33 At Ysgol Gynradd Pencarnisiog the headteacher has successfully improved the culture of the school over the last two and a half years. The school historically had a culture that implied that small, rural schools do not have issues wit h learner s' well- being, and being a learner in need of support or intervention carried a stigma. As a result, learner s were not always supported well enough. The headteacher has worked with staff and parents /carers to promote health and well -being, putting it at the heart of her vision for the school. Learner s in the school now speak freely about well-being and the importance of sharing worries and fears. Learner s understand the value and impact of the intervention service in the school for learner s who are struggling, even if they have not received support themselves. Staff in the school have a better understanding of the needs and feelings of learner s and are improving learning experiences and support services in response. 7.2 Curriculum The Cur riculum for Wales Framework gives every school in Wales the opportunity to design their own curriculum. It enco urages schools to build their own vision for their learners within the context of the four purposes and the learning defined at a national level. It provides the space for practitioners to be creative and to develop meaningful learning through a range of experiences and contexts that meet the needs of their learners. Becoming 'healthy confident individuals' is one of the four purposes of the new curriculum and enabling leaders to develop healthy relationships will be a key part of this. In the new curriculum the Health and Well -being Area of Learning and Experience is about developing the capacity of learners to navigate life's opportunities and c hallenges. The Health and Well -being Area of Learning and Experience highlights the importance of mental health and emotional well -being and its links with physical well - being and resilience. Learning about mental health and emotional well -being forms one of the statements of what matters in the Curriculum for Wales Framework. These statements will be mandatory elements of every school's curriculum. However, the new Framework allows professionals the flexibility to choose specific content that meets the needs of learners in their specific context. This includes : outdoor learning - the Welsh Government recognises the unique value of outdoor learning and the many benefits it brings for learners , including supporting the development of healthy and active lifestyles , developing problem -solving skills , and developing understanding and respect for nature and the environment in which they live. Outdoor learning will be considered across all areas of l earning and experience; for example, the Health and Well -being A rea will highlight the importance of regular experiences outdoors to support young people's physical and mental -pupils -health- and- wellbeing 37 relationships and sexuality education (RSE) - RSE will be a mandatory element of the new curriculum for learners aged 3 -16, and statutory guidance will be published as to what should be included. RSE will play an important role for the safeguarding and protection of all learners in Wales. Schools will have the potential to create safe and empowering environments that build u pon learners' own formal and informal learning and experiences, offline and online. The aim is to gradually empower learners (at developmentally appropriate stages) to build the knowledge, skills and ethical values to equip them with the tools to be able t o understand how relationships, sex, gender and sexuality shape their own and other people's lives. It seeks to support learners' rights to enjoy equitable, safe, healthy and fulfilling relationships throughout their lives the ability for learners to recognise, understand and speak out about discrimination and violence and know how and where to seek support and advice on a range of issues. We are clear that RSE should not be delivered in isolation. It should be considered as part of whole- school approach ensuring it is effectively integrated and coordinated as part of the whole curriculum. Professional learning is a key element in embedding comprehensive RSE through a whole- school approach. Schools should enable their teachers to access learning that can support them to develop confidence and knowledge regarding RSE topics. 7.3 Staff well -being For a whole- school approach to be successful it cannot be limited to learner well- being , but must also consider the well -being of all school staff. Issues that affect teacher well-being can have a significant knock -on effect for learner well-being . Emotionally and m entally healthy teachers are better able to develop strong teacher - learner relationships. This in turn is important not simply in terms of ensuring academic attainment, but in fostering an ethos that nurtures the young person, building their cooperation, commitment, resilience and confidence. All school senior leadership teams need to be aware of particular areas of stress that impact on staff well-being , and should ensure that evidence- based interventions are promoted, with staff supported in a timely and appropriate fashion when needed. In- school factors are not the only issues that can affect teacher well -being . The National Evaluation and Im provement Resource self-evaluation resource for schools enables senior leaders hip teams to review teacher well -being and identify common stressors such as high workload or excessive burdens of out -of-classroom activities. The resulting priorities and actions will form part of the school improvement planning process and help inform polic ies and plans related to addressing the workload and well-being of the education workforce. The Welsh Government's national mission reinforces a commitment to reduce unneces sary workload and bureaucracy by providing greater clarity of what is and is not required in the classroom. Steps already taken to address some of the issues include: development of a new evaluation and accountability system based on trust, respectful professional dialogue and proportionality 38 publication of resources on ' reducing workload' , as well as training materials and guidance in conjunction with our stakeholders ( including Estyn, consortia and unions ) introduc ing improvements to ensure equity of access for teachers to digital services via Hwb establish ing the Managing Workload and Reducing Bureaucracy Group, in partnership with key stakeholders from all tiers and teacher trade unions, to address workload issues for the education workforce. While it is clear that we are making progress , we need to continue to work collaboratively across the education profession. As announced by the Minister for Education, the four key priorities t he Managing Workload and Reducing Bureaucracy Group is working towar ds are: to develop a Workload Charter and Toolkit for the school workforce to refresh and promote the Reducing Workload Resources and Training Pack and monitor take- up to further develop and circulate the training models and exemplar case studies produced across all four consortia regions to develop a cohesive approach to be applied on a national basis to carry out a sector -wide audit exercise to examine what data is collected across all tiers and how impact assessment s on workload should be considered as part of policy development. Additionally, the Welsh Government has commissioned the services of Education Support, a charity organisation with expertise in supporting the mental health and well-being of education staff. The Education Support project will run throughout the 2020/21 academic year and will provide a range of services ranging from live digital events, resilience training, peer support groups, well-being support materials for Hwb, and telephone support services . While workload and the pressures of the profession are factors directly linked with well-being , another equally important 'stressor' is classroom behaviour and having to deal with behavioural and other issues related to the children and young people they teach. The whole- school approach and this Framework is designed to address those factors in particular by ensuring staff are supported to deal appropriately with issues in the classroom and that their own well -being is equally valued. School s' senior leadership teams need to recognise the varied factors that affect teacher well-being . During 2021 the Welsh Government will undertake a leadership review , where we look at the support available for leaders across Wales to ensure we can provide clarity on responsibilities for all involved. The National Academy for Education Leadership (NAEL) is a grant -funded arm's length organisation developed and launched in May 2018 that considers all leadership aspects for the education sector. Among other things, it considers quality of leadership development provision and acts as a conduit for how leadership should develop moving forward. It was set up at the request of the Minister in 2016. As part of its work it has considered the health and well -being of leaders in the system as a result of COVID -19 and how they can be supported moving forward. 39 NAEL has recently held a conference with a theme of well -being. It is also convening a working group to look at the survey results of leadership well- being with a view to develop a well -being strategy for leaders in Wales. Case study : Penllergaer Primary School 36 Penllergaer Primary School , Swansea, paid for the local school -based counselling service to provide regular supervision for any member of staff who wished to participate. Staff who participated found it valuable to be able to share their feelings and experiences and learned skills in supporting each other. The school now runs its own supervision in- house. 7.4 School environment The school physical environment (classrooms, outdoor spaces, dining and other communal areas and toilets) all contribute to a learner 's sense of well -being . They also contribute to the well -being of the adults who work in and those who are regular visitors to the school. The use of space, lighting, noise and temperature (as well as walls for display) can all contribute to children's behaviour and the school's ability to regulate that behaviour , as well as the extent of social interaction between learners and school staff. Access to and use of outdoor spaces also contribute to good physical and mental well -being. For young people experiencing distress having access to safe, private (but not isolated) and calming spaces where they are not overlooked or overheard is important. Schools are used to providing spaces for use by school counsellors that meet these criteria, though there is also a need to balance the need to provide an available private nurturing space, together with not having such spaces labelled so as to avoid any stigma and discrimination attached to its use. The 21 st Century Schools and Colleges Programme37 is committed to improving learning environment s for our learners and to support ing schools to consider the effective use of educational spaces for all learners ' needs. Early stakeholder consultation into the design of new -build and major refurbished school buildings ensure the health and well -being of learners is considered at the earliest stages. Local authorities and FE institutions are also encouraged to integrate appropriate design measures in order to make a positive impact on well -being. 7.5 Timing of the school day Routine is an important part of children's lives. It provides structure and boundaries, and also supports teaching staff. While temporary changes to start and finish times may be necessary to facilitate social distancing during the pandemic, more 36 From Estyn 's Healthy and h appy (2019) r eport . 37 gov.wales/21st -century -schools -programme 40 permanent changes can be disruptive for parents /carers and children. In addition, shortened break times may detrimentally affect learners, particularly if tim e to eat, play, relax or socialise is limited. Schools and local authorities should ensure they carefully consider the impact on the well-being of learners and parents/carers when considering making c hanges to school session times. Learning and teaching time should not be reduced as a result of making changes, nor should break times be reduced to an extent that may adversely affect learners' well -being. 7.6 The importance of play Freely chosen, self -directed play makes a critical contribution to children's health and well-being and development. The Welsh Government places great value on play and its importance in the lives of children in our society. We are committed to supporting children's fundamental right to be able to play . Play is central to their enjoyment of life, contributes to their well -being and is essential for the growth in children's cognitive , physical , social , behavioural and emotional development. It is through play that children engage and interact with the world around them. In rece nt decades there has been a decline in children's freedom to play and explore on their own, independent of direct adult guidance and direction. This has resulted from parents' fears (such as of strangers, traffic, bullying and dangers in nature), the increased time and weight given to schooling and, outside of school , children spending more time in education setting s (such as football training, dance or music lessons) where they are directed, ranked, and judged by adults . It is key that schools support free play for children of all ages by providing sufficient time within the school day for play and break times. Free play allows children to learn to solve their own problems and become competent in pursuit of their own interests and happiness. Evidence shows that active play contributes strongly to children's health and well -being. It is shown as contributing to both children's physical and mental health, reducing childhood obesity and reducing the likelihood they will suffer from anxiety, depression and other disorders. The removal of break time as a punishment for bad behaviou r and its inclusion within behavioural management policies can cause stigmatisation and can constitute bullying . It is also in conflict with children's right to play. Schools should also be aware of the Health and Safety Executive's statement 'Children's play and l eisure - promoting a balanced approach' 38, which recognises the benefits of chal lenging play opportunities , and acknowledges that in supporting 'the provision of play for all children in a variety of environments ...HSE understands and accepts that this means children will often be exposed to play environments which, whilst well -managed, carry a degree of risk and sometimes potential danger. ' 38 www.hse.gov.uk/entertainment/childs -play-statement.htm 41 Children's right to play is enshrined in Article 31 of the UNCRC. The UN Gene ral Comment 17 on Article 31 notes that schools have a major role in the promotion of the right to play . Wales was the first nation in the world to put play on a statutory footing. Local authorities in Wales must assess and, where practicable, secure sufficiency of play opportunities to meet the needs of families in their area. Regulations and statutory guidance set out the wide range of m atters across several policy areas that local authorities have to take into account in their play sufficiency assessments. As part of their play sufficiency assessments, local authorities must assess to what extent : children are provided with an interesting play environment for breaks during the school day children are provided morning, lunchtime and afternoon play breaks. Wales - A Play Friendly Country (2014) is statutory guidance to local authorities assessing for and securing sufficient play opportunities for children in their areas. It supports local authorities in complying with the duty under section 11 of the Children and Families (Wales) Measure 2010 . The statutory guidance not es that schools provide an important opportunity for children to play during the school day and for periods before and after classes. Schools can also provide valuable play space at weekends and during holidays. Play Wales, the charity that supports children's play in Wales , has created some useful guidance and resources that schools can use 39. 7.7 Information, awareness raising and advocacy Good progress has been made in recent years in raising awareness of poor mental health and tackling stigma and discrimination across society. In the school environment school teaching staff should encourage learner s to discuss, and consider their own (in a way which does not make them feel pressured to disclose personal issues) and others emotional and mental well-being , including how t o develop empathetic responses to their peers. The new curriculum , and in particular, the Health and Well -being Area of Learning and Experience, provides opportunit ies to embed this approach within specific lessons and across learning as appropriate. Mental health literacy, arising from the concept of health literacy, is defined as understanding how to obtain and maintain positive mental well -being 40. It is an important empowerment tool, in particular for those young people with ALN, as it them better understand their own well -being and enables them to act on this information. It increases people's resilience and control and enhances help- seeking literacy 42 Schools can play a key role in developing the mental health literacy of their learner s and empowering children and young people to make informed decisions. School senior leadership teams should consider their target audiences (e.g. learner s, parents/carers and staff) and look for innovative ways of making information available to each ; for instance, on the school website supporting older learner s to act as peer mentors and encouraging all school staff to feel comfortable signposting to relevant well-being support resources and information. They should ensure that information is publicised at times of possible greatest need (e.g. during exams) , ensuring regular campaigning and key messages are promoted in appropriate formats such as social media. There are also a range of external agencies , particularly operating within the third sector, that can provide schools with support and resources, both in terms of providing information and support for learner s and parents/carers, and in terms of training staff and providing advocacy services. Access to advocacy support, particularly for those with greater levels of poor mental well -being, can be especially helpful , as children and young people often report feeling unsure and not knowing where to turn to during this difficult period. Access to y outh worker support can help provide an accessible relationship with a trusted adult, particularly for those young people who may find it difficult to look for support from teachers or those perceived as being in positions of authority. As part of our co mmitment to support a consistent whole- school approach across Wales, the Welsh Government will work with partners to provide a range of agreed information and awareness -raising materials that schools can access. Independent Professional Advocacy: Nationa l Standards and Outcomes Framework for Advocacy for Children and Young People in Wales (2019) 41 sets out well -being outcomes for people who need care and support and carers who need support ; this includes advocacy. The Framework states people must have the opportunity to speak for themselves and contribute to the decisions affecting their lives, or have someone who can do it for them. The achievement of this must be measured; it is vital commissioners of advocacy services and advocacy service providers can measure the quality as well as the quantity of their work and be assured they are making a positive difference to the lives of children and young people. The NSOF therefore sets out the underpinning standards and outcomes in relation to advocacy. The National Approach to S tatutory Advocacy (NASA) , which has been in place since 2017, sets out shared national expectations on access and availability of (independent professional) advocacy. Underpinned by the NSOF, common components of a service specification and reporting template, the NASA reinforces and secures a consistent offer and experience for children and practitioners. The NASA further evidences and informs future delivery and improvement through quantitative and qualitative reporting at local, regional and national levels. 41 gov.wales/advocacy -standards -and-outcomes -framewo rk-children- and-young- people 43 The task and finish group held their final meeting on 25 January. A legacy document is being finalised that will be available on the Welsh Government website. This will include the component documents of the NASA: Independent Pro fessional Advocacy: National Standards and Outcomes Framework for Advocacy for Children and Young People in Wales service specification range and level mechanism national reporting template guidance for advocacy providers on completion of the national r eporting t emplate. Under the NASA 'Children and young people are entitled to an active offer of advocacy from a statutory i ndependent professional advocate (IPA) when they become looked after or become the subject of child protection enquiries leading to an Initial Child Protection Conference' . Section 21 of the Part 10 Code of Practice (Advocacy) - provides more detail on this 42. The Welsh Government also currently funds Meic43 - the information, advice and advocacy helpline for children and young people - which is a helpline service for children and young people up to the age of 25 in Wales. The service offers a telephone/text chat line, as well as a website providing advice and guidance relating to any matters that could affect children and young people. In addition , Tros Gynnal Plant have a website (see https://whatisadvocacy.cymru/ ) that is a tool for learners to find out how they can access advocacy services in Wales. 7.8 Universal provision All children and young people should have access to a range of tools and support for their emotional and mental well-being both at school and at home, if a blended learning approach is re quired. Universal provision is not about learner s requiring and accessing dedicated specialist support, but rather it is about supporting them to understand their own well-being in building resilience and in developing coping mechanisms to manage the everyday stresses and challenges experienced throughout life, as well as in knowing when and how to access support . This should be reflected by a range of universal provisions that learner s receive both within the classroom , such as introductions to emotional literacy , or outside of the classroom , including though youth work approaches or universal pastoral support. Work to integrate elements of the WNHSS with the requirements of this F ramework and the support of the imple mentation leads will help schools in identifying 44 priorities for improvement and their strengths upon which they can build sustainable provision. However, universal support does not need to be through the provision of formal programmes , though many f ormal programmes are available and can provide a structured approach to delivery . Rather , the school ethos of nurturing young people, having trusted relationships with school staff, being able to talk about issues and the way well -being is taught through a school's new curriculum will be all that is required in many instances. Other actions that support well-being , such as establishing greater links with PRUs and providing learner s with the opportunities for outdoor activities, weekly unstructured time for well -being activities, or quiet drop- in spaces they can access when they need 'time out' , should also be considered. Where school senior leadership teams do choose to use a structured universal intervention they should have access to evidence- based interv entions and the autonomy to choose the intervention(s) that best meet their needs. When delivering such interventions, school senior leadership team s should consider working together in clusters and/or with other partners in a multi -agency approach to supp ort each other, to develop communities of practice and to achieve economies of scale when procuring interventions from external providers. Local authorities and regional consortia can provide support and commission this on a local or wider regional basis. School senior leadership teams, teachers and wider school staff should actively recognise the link between learner and staff well -being and their school policies and actions (which include tackling bullying 44, safeguarding, healthy relationships, play and recreational opportunities, learner participation and equalities ). These policies should be reviewed to ensure that they do not detract from, but align and reinforce where possible, their whole- school approach. Senior leadership teams and teaching staff should also consider the importance of maintaining a routine in times of disruption, for instance ensuring supply teachers are informed of the needs of classes and the learners they are teaching , and existing classroom protocols. As part of our commitment to support a consistent whole- school approach across Wales the Welsh Government will work with partners to assess the range of universal provision in Wales and provide a 'toolkit' of good practice. Case study : Archbishop McGrath Catholic High School45 Archbishop McGrath Catholic High School has a Friday running club that is for both staff and learner s. This club provides a shared opportunity for staff and learner s of any ability to go for a run together in the local area during lunchtime. This promotes positive relationships and shared values, and benefits learner s' health and well - being. 44 gov.wales/school -bullying 45 From Estyn 's Healthy and h appy (2019) report 45 7.9 Targeted provision Sometimes children and young people will need support over and above universal provision. As detailed elsewhere in this Framework , being emotionally and mentally healthy is not black and white. There is a wide spectrum, or continuum, of well -being and everyone, including children and young people, will move across the spectrum at different points in their li ves as challenges and both internal and external factors affect them. Targeted provision may also need to be considered for some children during times of transition (see section on transition ). Targeted provision should be proportionate to need and range from time -limited low - level support, such as an empathetic response from a trusted professional (e.g. a teacher ) or other talking -related therapies , to more specialist support for those with suspected mental health or behavioural problems provided by specialist services such as CAMHS. In each case school senior leadership team s should have access to a range of evidence- based interventions (delivered by the school staff or appropriate professional) to support the young person. This provision should be offered and delivered in as de- stigmatising a way as possible and the offer of targeted provision should not result in learner s having to miss their preferred classroom or extra- curricular activities. Wherever possible, parents/carers should be encouraged to be involved in any discussion around prov ision for their child or young person. The school 's senior leadership team should have good working relationships with external support services and know how to access them when needed. Mental health services should be available and responsive to support schools in this way, particularly around issues of risk and self -harm. Indeed, often a supportive telephone or face- to-face consultation with a mental health professional can prevent the escalation of a referral to specialist services. For young people, being able to talk to a trusted adult who they know well can be far more therapeutic than being referred to a remote professional that they have never met before and have to wait several weeks to see. However, school staff need to feel confident that they are doing all they need to, and are not missing anything important in that supportive role. Ultimately , it supports a move away from a 'refer -on' culture to one where staff feel confident enough to be able to 'hold on', knowing they are supported and that their value as the person who knows the young person best within the school setting is recognised. To facilitate this, schools need to conduct, document and consult on risk assessments, skills assessments and workload impact assessments. Control measures identified in this process (e.g. altered timetables, reduction of other duties, recruitment of staff, training , etc.) need to be implemented and s enior managers need to liaise with appropriate external bodies and agree documented service level agreements t hat identify how they will work together. Other direct interventions can include nurture group provision, the role of emotional literacy support assistants (ELSAs) and alternative lunchtime provision for learner s with sensory issues or anxiety. In additi on, informal methods such as peer mentoring can form part of the targeted offer. Targeted provision should be based on evidence of need rather than diagnosis , because, as previously mentioned, many children and 46 young people will have real needs but not dia gnosable mental illness . Diagnosis should not be used as a gatekeeping mechanism for accessing targeted interventions either within or outside the school setting . As part of our commitment to support a consistent whole- school approach across Wales, the Welsh Government will work with partners to assess the range of targeted provision in Wales and provide a 'toolkit' of good practice. Case study : Ysgol Gynradd Aberteifi 46 Ysgol Gynradd Aberteifi has used the Pupil Development Grant funding to create a pupil pastoral worker (PPW) post to develop links with hard- to-reach parents /carers . This person also coordinates staff training with a focus on learner well -being, delivers a specific programme to target learners' emotional needs and provides counselling sessions in the school for learners and parents /carers . The PPW works very closely with a wide range of specialist agencies and seeks expert external support where necessary. The PPW has established trusting relati onships with parents /carers and holds regular informal 'drop in' sessions for parents /carers to discuss matters of concern or share information. In addition, the PPW makes regular home visits to parents /carers who do not feel comfortable coming to school. The PPW has been trained to deliver a wide range of beneficial programmes to both learners and parents /carers, such as coping with bereavement, controlling negative emotions and dealing with domestic violence. The PPW also coordinates the delivery of a wi de range of tailored intervention programmes that are delivered by other staff within the school. These include support for anger management, emotion coaching, play interventions and a programme for raising learners' self -esteem. The school has also provi ded training to all staff that enables them to use a range of strategies to promote positive engagement at class level. All learners (including those with ACEs) benefit from consistent approaches to develop their resilience and positive mental health. Whol e-school training in recent years includes training on attachment disorder, emotion coaching, restorative approaches, and supporting the children of incarcerated parents /carers and those exposed to domestic abuse. 7.10 Provision for children and young pe ople with specific needs School senior leadership team s will support the health and well -being of all of their learner s through positive well-being environments, good learner -staff relationships and universal /targeted initiatives as outlined above. However , some patterns of behaviour mean that a child or young person will need more targeted and intensive support. These patterns of behaviour can include: 46 From Estyn 's Knowing your children - supporting pupils with adverse childhood experiences (ACES) report (2020) 47 disordered eating and poor body esteem risk-taking and continuous disruptive behaviour bullying other children47 substance misuse frequent school absences and those experiencing loneliness and isolation those suffering low mood and anxiety or poor self -esteem . Schools' senior leadership team s need to accommodate the needs (and potentially long-term issues) of learners falling within these categories when consider ing their learner and parent/carer population in order to develop well -being plans as part of wider school improvement policies. As part of our commitment to work with partners to assess the range of targeted provision and provide a 'toolkit' of good practice, we will consider the particular needs of these learners . 7.11 Self-harm and suicide Suicidal ideation and self -harm is al so an issue school staff will encounter, though contrary to what we hear in the media, suicide is a rare event among children and young people. Self-harm is more common, with around 1 in 10 adolescents reporting having self -harmed, though most young people who self -harm stop before adulthood. However, coming across instances of suicidal thought and/or expressions of self -harm can be very distressing , both for the young person concerned and the adult that they have disclosed the information to ( or who has become aware of the issue from some other source) . Recognising this the Welsh Government published Responding to issues of self - harm and thoughts of suicide in young people48 in 2019. The guidance has been produced to support teachers , as well as other prof essionals who regularly come into contact with children and young people, in dealing with issues of suicide and self - harm as they arise. It supports early intervention and prevention and the safe management of self -harm and suicidal thoughts in learners when they present. It is not meant to supplant specialist training, rather it provides a quick and accessible source of reference to the general principles of best practice and signposts to other sources of support and advice. School senior leadership team s, teachers and other school staff should all be aware of the guidance and ensure its existence i s promoted widely among staff. They should also not be afraid to talk about the issues, and there is no evidence that a conversation with a young person where you try to understand the reasons and circumstances for self -harming makes them more likely to self -harm or puts the idea into their head. In fact , non-judgemental conversations may encourage them to seek help in the future. 47 gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2018- the rare instance of a suic ide, this will affect the whole school community . Both the school 's senior leadership team and their local authorit y should have suicide prevention and intervention strategies in place, including in relation to postvention to use after a suicide or suicide attempt of a learner or school staff member. 7.12 Provision for vulnerable children and young people Some learners are at higher risk of facing poor well -being and experiencing adverse outcomes. School senior leadership teams should be taking an inclusive and non- stigmatising approach to ensuring good well -being for all of their learner s, regardless of circumstance. However, it is important to acknowledge that some learners may need additional support at different times and more targeted early intervention to prevent negative experiences . School senior leadership team s should consider their learner and parent/carer population when developing their well -being plan as part of the wider school improvement process to make sure it accommodates the needs of any learner s who are part of one or more vulnerable or historically marginalised groups, including: children and young people under supervision of children's services care-experienced children and young people children and young people who are engaged with the youth justice system children and young people with ALN children and young people at risk of disengaging with education children and young people at risk of youth homelessness LGBT+ children and young people young carers refugee and asylum seeker children and young people 49 Gypsy and Traveller children and young people children and young people with chronic illness children from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds, who may be uncomfortable discussing mental health issues due to stigma. When considering the needs of these learners schools and service providers ( such as youth offending team s, health services, specialist services and local authority children's services ) need to develop positive working partnerships with the school to effectively support these vulnerable children and to build their resilience . School senior leadership teams should take account of these learner's circumstances and factor in flexibility and empathy to their response. In addition, there are times when learner s are more likely to need support with their well-being times of transition ( see section below ) during exam periods and following the release of exam results following traumatic experiences, e.g. bereavement , parental separation or an asylum journey . Case study : Gilwern Primary School 50 In Gilwern Primary School , trained staff use the emotional literacy support assistant (ELSA) approach to support vulnerable learner s effectively. The approach provides a reflective space where a learner is able to share honestly their thoughts and feelings, and aims to understand the psychological need behind poor self -esteem or undesirable behaviour. Through the approach, a learner in the school with significant behavioural and social needs was supported to relate better to their peers, to improve their decision- making in social contexts, and to be better at identifying risky situations. Using the same approach, an anxious learner who had transferred from a different school was helped to settle well, and a learner with a history of poor attendance was supported, through a phased return, back to full engagement with school. 7.13 Transition Transition between home and education setting s, education setting s and school, primary and secondary school, or between different schools, has been highlighted as a time that can be particularly destabilising for some learners , such as those with ALN. For younger learners the importance of ear ly years support , establishing partnerships between parents /carers and education settings from the earliest stage will help smooth the process . Other transition points include health transitions (including older learners moving from children's to adult services), where these external transitions can caus e anxiety, worry and concern that may manifest in the classroom . This may be exacerbated by schools not being engaged at an early enough stage, or not engaged at all. This in turn may impact on the learner 's education, in addition to creating challenges around joined- up working between school and health. Schools are very familiar with the issues surrounding transition and many take steps to ensure that transition between e ducation setting s is made as smooth as possible. The best transition plans 51 clearly set out how parents /carers , education setting s and schools will work together to effectively meet the emotional and mental health needs of learners (e.g. through peer support networks) in advance of the transition into secondary education. Consideration should also be given to learner s who move schools outside of the usual transition points . These moves are often the result of a geographic relocation, and for some, such as the children of armed forces personnel, can be a frequent issue. The learner may be more vulnerable because of their lack of familiarity with the new area and loss of local friend networks , and may be at greater risk of 50 From Estyn 's Healthy and happy (2019) r eport . 51 www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/section/198 50 loneliness and isolation. School senior leadership team s and local authorities should have effective information- sharing protocols established to support this kind of transition. The other key transition time for all learner s is when they finish school and begin the transition to the workforce or FE/HE . This can be a time of stress and anxiety, and additional well-being support to learner s in their final year of school is recommended. Research52 shows that moving to a new environment, academic and social demands, and anxiety around finding a job are all risk factors for learners ' mental health. School senior leadership teams should work with colleges, universities and other post -16 learning providers to support learners' transition, including by building resilience and sharing learner information within agreed data- sharing arrangements. This will help post -16 providers to offer the necessary support and ensure that learners can succeed in their studies. Case study : King Henry VIII Comprehensive School 53 King Henry VIII Comprehensive School works closely with its partner primary schools to take a comprehensive approach to making transition as smooth as possible. The focus through the range of activities is to build positive relationships between learner s, parents /carers and the staff at King Henry VIII prior to learner s arriving there in Year 7. The approach includes: teachers from King Henry VIII contributing to lessons in Year s 5 and 6 as well as those in Year 6, learners from Year 5 visiting King Henry VIII for activities music and sports events during Year 6 for all partner primary schools at King Henry VIII School informal parents '/carers ' evenings well-being leader from King Henry VIII visiting partner primary schools to meet learners, discuss expectations, hopes and fears about life in secondary school 7.14 Leadership and s taff training Positive relationships between school staff and learner s are at the heart of ensuring a whole- school approach to emotional and mental well-being . It is the everyday 'little things' that teachers do that have surprisingly far -reaching outcomes for learner well- being . Studies show that what matters to learner s is that teachers listen, are encouraging and positive, take an interest in them as people and empathise with their difficulties54. However , this is only possible if staff have the confidence and time to actively listen to learners as well as to respond appropriately even to challenging or concerning topics. Staff need appropriate training for this and the space to put it into practice. They also need to be supported to maintain their own well -being and 52 www.instituteofhealthequity.org/resources -reports/improving- school -transitions -for-health- equity 53 From Estyn 's Healthy and happy (2019) report 54 Roffey, S (2017) 'Ordinary magic' needs ordinary magicians : the power and practice of positive relationships for building youth resilience and wellbeing' https://gov.wales/school -nursing- framework 51 have access to appropriate supervision, particularly when dealing with more challenging issues that have the potential to impact on their own well -being . Teachers and leaders should be given opportunities and time to access training on how they are able to support learners' well-being . Some teachers may also wish to develop a greater knowledge and professional understanding of more specific issu es and should have access to a range of resources and additional training to do so. Such professional learning opportunities will also support the design and implementation of a school's curriculum. More and more of such professional learning opportunities are becoming available, many through blended or online courses. We have made and will continue to make significant investments in digital learning resources to support teachers in their professional learning journey. We are already building on the successful resources on Hwb to provide high- quality blended and remote learning experiences. We are working with higher education institute (HEI) partners to develop a range of resources for all schools focused on h ealth and w ell- being and e nquiry and r eflectio n. These resources will be made available via Hwb in due course. HEI partners are also supporting work to significantly upscale our National Professional Enquiry Programme (NPEP). During 2020/ 2021 over 300 schools will be developing as professional enquir ers, focusing on a range of enquiry themes including a range of i nclusion -focused enquiries linked to health and well -being and vulnerable learners. Enquiry outputs will continue to feed into the wider Curriculum for Wales Professional Learning Programme delivered by regional consortia. We will continue to build upon these strong professional learning foundations as we move closer towards 2022. Understanding and having a knowledge of the emotional and mental well -being of learners , as well as a need to recogni se individual learner needs , is a core part of our new programmes in i nitial teacher education. To support this , and as part of our commitment to support a consistent whole- school approach across Wales, the Welsh Government is working with partners to develop training modules on child development, emotional and mental well -being, neurodevelopment and pedagogy, as well as others that would be available to teachers from initial teacher training, though newly qualified teachers and as part of continuous professional development . However, rather than limiting emotional and mental well -being tr aining to leaders and teachers, it is important that appropriate training resources are available for all school -based staff who work directl y with children and young people. Some school support staff have a specific role in relation to promoting /supporting well-being , e.g. school counsellors, school nurses , educational psychologists and education learning support assistants . Staff in these roles have an important role to play in raising awareness of emotional and mental well -being issues among other members of staff and act as sources of advice and support . They should be given time to allow them to support learner s and staff as part of multidisciplinary teams to provide consultation, liaison and advice where appropriate. Joint training, to foster a greater 52 understanding of the different roles members of staff have and to build relationships , should also be considered. Case study : Aneurin Bevan University Health Board School nurses provide invaluable support within the whole- school approach in providing support to learners for emotional well -being as part of their role in delivering the national school nursing framework55. Emotional support is usually provided through weekly school nurse drop- in sessions, which are well attended and highlight issues such as self -harm or anxieties. During the pandemic , when access to learners has been limited health services have adapted by use of the virtual technology Attend Anywhere which provides anonymity for learners and has a far reach across school communities. Aneurin Bevan U niversity Health Board have been undertaking a transformation- funded project to deliver enhanced drop- ins vir tually and face- to-face in collaboration with psychology support. Whil e this is currently being formally evaluated, initial uptake by learners appears increased and interim feedback from both school nurses and learners is positive. With the experience du ring the pandemic and the roll out of At tend Anywhere across Wales, this model could be replicated as good practice. It is suggested that, where appropriate, school nurses work together to provide a shared online drop- in clinic resource for young people to access. School senior leadership teams , including governors, should ensure staff have access to refresher training through the national approach to professional learning that aligns with t he new professional standards, the s chools in Wales as learning organisations approach and professional learning model, to create a vision fit for the evolving education system in Wales for all educational practitioners and not just teachers. The national approach to professional learning is designed to ensure: that schools, leaders and teachers are able to access best practice in defining and sharing professional learning at school level, especially through the use of critical enquiry and collaborative learning that the providers of professional learning - the regional consortia, our universities and others - design professional learning experiences that are high quality, accessible and fit for purpose, e.g. through designs that include collaborative enquiry and e- learning. Integral to the n ational approach is ensuring that professional learning for all practitioners is adequately resourced, including both financial resources and time for teachers and leaders to engage with high- quality development opportunities. 55 gov.wales/school -nursing- framework 53 7.15 The role of youth work The important role of youth work in supporting the mental health and emotional well-being of learners was emphasised in the Mind over matter report56 and in the inquiry57 the Children , Young People and Education Committee undertook on youth work in 2016. Youth work provides welcoming, safe spaces in which young people are able to develop, talk about issues that may be affecting them, and build resilience. It is a vital preventive service, helping reduce the need for more acute, costly interventions further down the line. It can therefore have a substantial impact on children and young people's emotional and mental well -being . It does this by establishing trusted relationships with adults and peers, and offering young people opportunities for learning that are educative, expressive, participative, inclusive and empowering . Youth work is a universal entitlement, delivered by both voluntary and local authority youth services, and is open to all young people within the specified 11- 25 age range. Many schools al ready have established links with youth workers and youth work services and should be able to access local youth work support for young people, including those with emotional and mental health issues, via their local authority and voluntary sector partners . Youth work and youth workers need to be seen as 'part of the team'. School senior leadership team s should consider how to work effectively with their local youth work teams, both through the local authority and through the voluntary sector, to reduce duplication of services and to increase the diversity of support on offer to learners . This includes youth work embedded within the school and based in the wider community. There are many examples of recent reports citing the benefits to young people's well-being from schools and youth workers operating in partnership. These include through curriculum implementation, by improving engagement, attendance, and behaviour, by developing emotional resilience, and through the delivery of mental health support and RS E. Where schools require additional support to engage with or deliver youth work approaches with young people they can learn about what provision is available by contacting their local authority p rincipal youth officer and the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services. 7.16 Whole -system roles and r esponsibilities , and relationships with external services and parents /carers As indicated, schools are but one part of a wider system that includes the family and friends of children and young people as well as a myriad of general and specialist support services designed to support the child and wider family. School senior 56 www.assembly.wales/laid%20documents/cr -ld11522/cr -ld11522- e.pdf 57 www.assembly.wales/laid%20documents/cr -ld10870/cr -ld10870- e.pdf 54 leadership team s need to be an open partner with these other 'players' . In relation to the whole system, l ocal authorities, working throug h the RPBs and/or PSBs should work to hold partners to account and ensure their full engagement in the process so that schools are not left 'holding the baby ' and are able to access appropriate support, at the appropriate time for their learners. Building resilience and support for children and young people in schools through to community -based support is critical and will need to draw together a broad range of key stakeholders. This is all underpinned by rights -based, values -led, child -centred, attachment and trauma- informed approaches. The key ingredients to a whole- system approach will need to consider : the link to the whole- school approach the point of access to a range of early intervention and intensive support options community -embedded expertise to support trauma, self -harm and risk developing chi ldren, young people and family -led innovation, such as through peer support, digital and social media the need for resilient communities , safe housing, healthy food, leisure, sports, arts, etc. NHS providers will be one of the main sources of advice and support to schools and should operate a policy of 'no wrong door' when dealing with emotional and mental well-being needs. Work is already underway in many parts of Wales to provide a more collaborative joined- up approach, such as the work being pioneered across six local authorities by the CAMHS school in -reach pilots . These pilots have demonstrated that developing relationships across organisational boundaries is a driver of successful delivery. Picking u p the telephone for advice from mental health professionals, combined with training, can be an alternative to a referral , which CAMHS professionals may be unable to deal with directly . This collaborative joined- up approach should enable each school to access consultation, liaison and advice from specialist mental health services. Advice and discussion should occur prior to any referral and alternative signposting should be considered prior to referral to more specialist services. In particular, positive examples of strengthening relationships between services is s een in different areas of Wales where multi -agency panel meetings have been convened, allow ing staff to present cases and gain advice from the panel of different specialists. The Wales Accord on the Sharing of Personal Information (WASPI) allow s the sharing of necessary pertinent information between agencies to occur in a straightforward and timely manner, ensuring that children and young people experience a cohesive and joined- up service when they are in distress. Such collaboration aims to empower school staff who have become trusted adults to learner s and who may be struggling to feeling confident in supporting learner s. The third sector also has a significant role to play in supporting a whole -school approach to health and well -being and is a valuable source of expertise on working with schools and with young people. Indeed, t he third sector is an essential partner in developing whole- school approaches. They provide a range of services from providing a conduit to access under -represented groups of parents and learners; providing independent child- focused support to children and young people, and to 55 teachers and learning staff; and s upporting children and young people's voice in the process as expert facilitators, particularly supporting inclusive practice with a wide range of children with additional needs. There are many third sector organisations whose missions align with the goals of this Framework and who can offer schools invaluable support . Schools need to be aware of and engage with third sector providers in their area. Case study 1 The Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, as part of their whole systems approach to child and adolescent mental health and well -being transformation, have developed Single Points of Access for Children's Emotional Well -being Panels (SPACE Panels) in each of their l ocal authority areas. These forums meet on a weekly basis and co- ordinate all requests for support around issues to do with behaviour, mental health and emotional well -being. Representatives from each service that offers input in this area attend, including specialist CAMHS, primary care mental health support services, Families First , educational psychology services, y outh services and third sector providers. The forum works on the principal that a child, young person and family's need can be matched to the service that best fits at that point in time, and operates on a 'no wrong door' basis. This prevents families and referrers having their requests rejected because they don't meet the criteria, for example; and feeling that they are starting from scratch in working out where to turn next. These forums have proved invaluable in matching demand with available resources and in time, it is hoped, they will be a vital vehicle for highlighting gaps in provision and highlighting the direction RPBs need to take to address these gaps through future service development. The added advantage is that each representative develops positive relationships with, and a deeper understanding of , the whole range of services in their area. Case study 2 Hywel Dda School in- reach pilot have developed and maintained collaborative working relationships with third sector agencies - e.g. Amethyst Project, Area 43 (counselling ) - sharing information appropriately , resulting in timely and effective outcomes for children and young people. Strong links are maintained with colleagues in specialist CAMHS where information gathered from school meetings is fed back. Networking has been a beneficial opportunity to share good practice , e.g. attending/participating in conferences. Regular contact with schools , e.g. structured consultations with training opportunities to reach the wider workforce have taken place, whil e the development of a newsletter promotes upcoming events along with supportive information. The service has begun offering reflective sessions to school staff, having identified through consultations the need. Protected time is offered to discuss staff well -being along with their individual concerns. To date five w ell-being drop-in sessions between two secondary sch ools with 12 staff taking up the opportunity. 56 7.16.1 Together for Children and Young People Programme (T4CYP(2)) Supporting and complementing our whole- school approach the NHS -led Together T4CYP(2) a Welsh Government priority with cross -cabinet comm itment. It aims to improve the way services provide emotional well -being and mental health support for children and young people, through coproduction with those with lived experience, their families, communities, NHS health boards, local authorities, and the third sector. T4CYP(2) has three areas of focus: EHES neurodevelopmental services RPBs. The agre ed programme objectives for 2021 are to: develop a national f ramework that describes the EHES that should be available in all areas of Wales, with the aim of addressing the so- called 'missing middle'. This will include working with RPBs continue to embed the neurodevelopmental pathway and standards developed through the first phase of the Programm e. support the development of a whole- system response for children and young people with n eurodevelopmental conditions. This work will include relevant linkages to implementation of the ALN Act provisions. The development of the EHES National Framework wil l seek to provide an early offer for children and young people and their families, who otherwise would be referred to the neurodevelopmental team. work with wider partners through RPBs to align to the direction of travel already set by Welsh Government work with RPBs to undertake a mapping exercise of current provision, with a view to supporting the adoption of the EHES National Framework at the b oard level. National Framework for EHES A draft high -level framework has been developed and consulted on. A more detailed framework, complete with digital -based support will be developed to embed the new coproduced Framework on a regional footprint later in 2021. EHES is based on the NEST (nurturing, empowered, safe, trusted) Framework. NEST marks an important culture shift from asking what is wrong with a child towards asking what a child's NEST is like in terms of their mental health and well - being. Partnership and neurodiversity remain key to the NEST approach. The six sections of NEST are: having one co nsistent adult in a child's life and being well supported a whole- school/ -system approach resilient communities coproduction and innovation easy access to expertise around risk and trauma a single point of access for services that support mental health and well -being. 57 Neurodevelopmental workstream The programme has been working with a range of stakeholder and partners to establish a holistic vision, based on a children' s rights approach t o shape both NHS services and influence wider support services across a range of neurodevelopmental conditions and co- occurring needs, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. The information will be used to enhance the drawing together of multi- disciplinary teams at a more local level, as part of planned work to review and update the current national pathway and standards. Neurodevelopmental digital provision Currently, children, young people and their families have to wait for their first consultation to receive the first tailored advice and support. Coupled with the increase in demand and impact of COVID -19, families could find themselves without an intervention for a prolonged period given the current size of the service r elative to the demand. To assist in addressing this, the programme is working with a number of partners to progress a plan to develop a bespoke online tool that could: increase and supplement existing neurodevelopmental assessment and diagnosis capacit y build resilience and enhance efficiency across the system in line with prudent healthcare measures, as part of a blended support offer be commissioned on a 'once for Wales' basis. A contract to make the necessary adaptions to an existing tool to test pr oof of concept has been awarded. This tool will aim to bring together current assessment tools used across Wales in a fully bilingual and timely way. The plan of the programme is to complete proof of concept with a view to progressing to a live test in early 2021. RPBs Work has commenced in establishing a group with a view to developing a shared vision for the future embedding of services, supported by genuine collaboration in order to achieve cultural change. This area of work aligns to the Children' s Commissioner's report No Wrong Door 58. Early engagement sessions with RPBs have taken place and early adopters will be sought in early 2021. Work is in hand with RPBs to establish the current position and future plans for emotional well -being and mental health of children and young people; this is planned for spring 2021. 7.16.2 The role of parents and carers The Welsh Government is committed to promoting the principles of positive parenting which is consistent with the basic principles of the UNCRC. To s upport this approach, the Welsh Government wants parents /carers to be given information, support and encouragement to enable them to choose the most positive approach to raising their children. We want children and parents /carers to have good bonding 58 www.childcomwales.org.uk/publications/no- wrong -door-bringing- services -together -to-meet - childrens -needs/ 58 and attachment from the outset, and encourage parents /carers to have positive and supportive relationships (whether they live together or not) to support effective co- parenting . We want all children to get the very best start in life and to thrive. Support to promote positive parenting is delivered at different points in a child's life through parenting groups and one- to-one work and ranges from informal, universal parenting support for parents /carers , through to more targeted, specialised interventions. Parenti ng programmes could enable parents /carers to feel confident to talk to and support their child's well -being and learning at home. Local authorities have responsibility for deciding the precise nature of local service delivery , depending on local circumstances and identified needs within their own areas. The Welsh Government's Parenting in Wales: Guidance on e ngagement and support 59 - is the principal statement on parenting support policy and sets out principles, expectations and vision for how parenting support services should be provided and contains a firm expectation for positive parenting principles to be promoted actively and consistently. Welsh Government's 'Parenting. Give it time' campaign, launched in November 2015, supports the actions within the Prosperity for All strategy to deliver extended, coherent support for parenting, focused on positive parenting and early intervention. It promotes positive parenting messages for families with chil dren up to the age of seven years of age, through social and print media and digital advertising. A dedicated bilingual website 60 - including ' Our Faces of Parenting' families, Facebook and Instagram pages, provides parenting tips, information and advice on common parenting concerns and signposts parents /carers to sources of further support. A suite of advice and information guides to support the wider challenges of parenting has been developed and is available online or as printed versions. Over 80,000 book lets and a suite of information sheets, created with key professionals and experts working with children and translated into 10 community languages, have been provided to local services such as the Family Information Service, Flying Start and Families Firs t settings, GP surgeries, health visitors, schools and libraries. We are working towards enhancing the information and support we already provide to parents and families and have made a commitment to expand the age range from 0- 7 years of age to 0- 18 years of age. A new ' Parenting. Give it t ime' campaign, 'Parenting Moments' focus es on three key themes - 'children's behaviour ', 'give them t ime' and 'supporting you'. Material to support the campaign has been developed, including a 'hero film' advert and a series of short positive parenting -themed films to raise awareness of the campaign. A managing behaviour film, developed by an early years professional , has been created and promoted on the ' Parenting. Give it t ime' website and social media channels. In addition , a series of short films, blogs and top tips resources, developed by parenting practitioners and experts in the field of parenting , have been developed promoting positive parenting messaging on a number of key topics such as routines, screen time, children's behaviour and parenting styles. 59 gov.wales/parenting- engagement -and-support -guidance- providers 60 gov.wales/parenting- give-it-time 59 Many schools successfully engage with parents /carers and families to support the well-being of learners and to help ensure that children don't fall behind with their learning. They are key partners in supporting the whole- system approach to well - being , developing and reinforcing well -being messages in the home. 60 Step 3 7.17 Evaluation and coproduction School senior leadership team s should evaluate the effectiveness of their plan as part of wider school improvement to ensure it is meeting their requirements , involving all parts of the school population of learners and staff in the evaluation. Learners, in particular, should not be considered as passive recipients only, rather they should be seen as valued contributors. As such , they should be involved at the very outset of and throughout the school 's establishment and implementation of its whole- school approach. Estyn's Healthy and h appy highlights the importance that staff and leaders place on listening to learners , not just having systems in place for pupil representation. Evaluation will be informed by the data and intelligence sources identified at 'Step 1' ; this should then become a process of continuous improvement , with schoo ls updating their plan as new and emerging priorities are identified. Coproduction with both learner s and parents/carers should be central to all aspects of this work and in particular evaluation. At its heart are reciprocal relationships built on trust, respect and mutuality. Opportunities to input into the plan and to be a part of monitoring and accountability processes can be facilitated through groups such as the school council , parent -teacher associations and governing bodies , but schools should also allow for individual learner s and parents/carers not in such a group to participate. School senior leadership team s should consider how learners will hold them 'to account' for adhering to the plan. In particular, emphasis is best placed on the views of those children and young people who are 'expert by experience'. School senior leadership team s should consider a range of methods for coproduction with learner s, staff and parents/carers. Questionnaires and focus groups , which gather views on aspects of school life ( including values, ethos and relationships ) can be useful in informing the evaluation. Case study : Cantref Primary School 61 Cantref Primary School empowers learner s by giving them a range of suitable leadership roles and responsibilities, and enabling groups of learner s to develop the school's work on the UNCRC. As a result, learner s have a very strong voice in the school, show respect to everyone in the school community and feel equally valued. The culture in the school allows learner s to carry out 'learning walks' where they observe learning activities and then provide helpful and respectful feedback to relevant staff. 7.18 Governance and accounta bility Within the school, w ell-being is of core importance to the functioning of all schools and should make up a part of routine leadership discussions. The senior leadership 61 From Estyn 's Healthy and happy (2019) report 61 team and the governing body must take 'ownership' of the plan, ensuring it is kept under continuous review as a part of school development planning, ensuring barriers and challenges to implementation are addressed. Progress needs to be reported to the governors , through the headteacher's report to governors, on a regular basis taking into account the school 's context and the particular needs of its population. Locally, in smaller schools, the small school population will mean that the senior leadership team can effectively oversee activity, though for larger schools it may be benefic ial to appoint a named person who leads and acts as coordinator, a source of advice and an advocate for well-being . School pastoral leads , WNHSS coordinators and other well -being leads exist and could fulfil such a role; this should therefore not place any further undue burden on staff. Staff should have access to appropriate time, training, support, supervision and communication, and will work closely with the schools wider pastoral team as well as act as the link officer for external partners and agencies. Named individuals should act as plan coordinators as well as sources of advice and support to others within the school and externally. They should advocate and champion well-being . Larger schools may find that this is too much work for any one individual and may choose to share the workload across a number of staff . This would also have the advantage that institutional knowledge and experience is maintained during times of staff 'churn'. However, whil e an individual may lead activity it needs to be stressed that this is still a joint responsibility for all school staff and the senior leadership team. Having a named individual should not lead others to think they do not have a central role to play in taking forward the whole- school approach. More widely, in order to effectively meet well -being needs there is a requirement for joint working across education, health and social care sectors (together with other partners such as the third sector). This requires a culture of collaboration and strong relationships across organisations. This can often be difficult given different organisational cultures but there are benefits not only for young people, who will find they have access to appropriate support in a timely fashion, but also to organisations . These benefits can include the cost -effective delivery of services , improved effectiveness and efficiency ( as appropriate interventions can prevent more serious issues developing in the longer -term), and promoting a whole- systems approach and shared responsibility among services. Local authorities should ensure that arrangements for supporting and developing learner s' emotional and mental well-being and related outcomes are scrutinised by elected members. In line with their responsibilities under the Part 9 guidance 62 RPBs and their relevant substructures operate to ensure partners work together to develop an integrated, whole- system, regional approach to developing and delivering services that support the emotional health and well -being of children and young people . This ensures a coherent approach to delivery of key policy frameworks including this Framework and the whole- school approach, the linked work of the T4CYP (2), and the ' no wrong door' approach. 62 gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2020- 02/part -9-statutory -guidance- partnership- arrangements.pdf 62 Annex 1 : Implementing whole-school approaches in Wales (examples) Many organisations, in particular t hird sector organisations, are now active in this field and are working with schools in Wales and across the UK to support well -being. The following are two exampl es of such work currently underway in Wales. A. Mind Cymru 's whole-school approach to mental health Initially we conducted a rapid review of over 150 research articles, both published and grey literature, to understand the existing evidence base for ment al health interventions in schools in English- speaking countries. Building on this evidence base, across Wales and England, we carried out in- depth conversations with 130 children to fin d out what they want and need. We asked over 140 teachers and parents what they think is missing. We also spoke with our expert local Minds, who are already providing support to children and young people in schools. We found that schools want to do more but find it hard to find the time or resource and say they need expert help. Teachers and parents /carers told us they want a whole- school approach to mental health. They want to understand the issues, to have the tools and resources they need, and to know where to access support for young people and themselves so they can feel more confident and have important conversations. Learners told us they want help for their mental health in schools. They want help that's respectful, practi cal and flexible, not medical or judg emental. Young people told us they place huge value on their mental health and well -being and want it to be given the same importance as academic success. We found lots of different ways to develop a whole- school appr oach to mental health, but limited evidence that backs up what works best. What's clear is that support needs to be broad enough to reach all members of the school community, but flexible enough to give specialist support to those who need help the most. In partnership with six local Minds across Wales and England, including two in London, we took a service- design approach working alongside 2,000 members of the school community to design and develop core interventions of the whole- school approach to mental health. Aim of our approach Our aim is to help learners to cope more easily with the challenges of everyday life, help them to manage stress, and to build supportive relationships with their peers. Every school that follows our approach will: \"Everyone should get support and help.\" Learner \"School community must work together for the benefit of pupils, teachers and parents.\" Parent \"Please tell me how, rather than another why. Most accept there is a need, we need support on how to implement.\" Senior leadership team member 63 promote good mental health and well -being to everyone as a right support everyone with a mental health problem find causes of poor mental health and find ways to keep everyone well respect diversity and promote equality build external partnerships to support learners achieve their very best. Mind's model Once schools have signed up to Mind's whole -school approach to mental health, they are supported through a four -step programme: Step 1: Whole -school mental health surv ey All members of the school community ( learners , parents and school staff) complete a survey to understand their knowledge of their school's approach to mental health and their personal mental health experiences. Alongside this , a designated member of the senior leadership team completes a survey on behalf of the school to understand the school's current approach to mental health. The results of the surveys are compared in order to understand the school's current strengths, differences in practice and per ception, and areas for development. Step 2: Bespoke action plan The school is supported to recruit a representative action planning group made up of learners , staff and parent /carer representatives. The group are responsible for reviewing the whole- school mental health survey data and designing an action plan to enhance strengths and address areas for development. Step 3: Implementation of action plan Actions can be largely grouped under three categories . 1. School -owned actions , e.g. review of policies and procedures, appointing lead member of SLT/governor for mental health 2. Mind interventions , e.g. mental health awareness training for staff, one-to-one support for learners , peer support for parents /carers 3. Signposting to community assets Step 4: Monitoring and e valuation To measure the impact of the whole- school approach to mental health pilot we have a two -level monitoring and evaluation process . 1. Quantitative evaluation of interventions utilising validated measures - to access impact at an intervention level 2. Whole -school mental health survey check in - to access impact at a school level and review areas targeted in the action plan. School s are encouraged to continuously review their action plan in relation to the findings of the monitor ing and evaluation as well as changing needs within their school. 64 Impact of the approach Mind's whole- school approach to mental health has been or is being delivered in 35 schools. Our evaluation of the 17 schools taking part in 2018/19 has shown: there are some indications that culture is starting to change, e.g. where conversations about mental health have been encouraged there has been positive change to learner and staff mental well -being and coping skills the programme has had a positive impact on learner and staff knowledge about mental health the programme has helped pupils and staff to feel more confident to support others. B. The Exchange and Swansea local authority whole-school approach to supporting psychological well-being in p rimary schools The Exchange and Swansea l ocal authority have worked collaboratively to establish a whole- school approach to promoting, protecting and developing the psychological well-being of children in p rimary schools. In recognition that the counselling provis ion that The Exchange' delivers in secondary schools is not appropriate for p rimary schools, a considered and well -researched model was created, tried and tested to establish a framework that is both strategic (coherent across the whole school and with oth er mental health providers) and operational (providing age- appropriate interventions to respond to the emotional/psychological distress of children). As schools provide the learning opportunities for children's academic and social development, The Exchange' model provides a parallel approach to psychological well-being that complements the natural development of learners through their school years ( primary and s econdary). This approach to psychological well -being, based on international research, identifies three distinct, but overlapping, areas of psychological resilience; each of the three areas requires specific resources to grow and develop within the child in order to support resilient emotional and psychological well -being . Externally derived r esources (relationships and belonging ) Internally derived r esources (identity and becoming ' me') Interactively derived r esources (self-management and interacting with others ) The development of these resources is a process that begins in childhood and then continues through the full lifespan of the individual. The specific psychological resources for development linked to each of the three areas can be clearly identified and because of this, supportive interventions (both proacti ve and reactive) can be introduced to target these areas ; in this way they are nurtured to grow within the child. When the adults in a child's life appreciate that the psychological difficulties that a child is experiencing are due to being ' under -resourced ' in specific areas it allows the adults to support the child appropriately and consider what can be done to nurture the growth of the resources. 65 The key concepts of this framework are easily accessible because they are explained in straightforward terms : there are the ' I have' resources (externally derived) the ' I am' resources (internally derived) and the ' I can' resources (interactively derived). This makes adopting the framework as a whole- school approach quickly achievable. Learning how to identify which of the specific areas of resilience are 'under - resourced' is the next step and requires a more in- depth approach but is easily learnable by staff in a school. From that point on, the school may apply this knowledge to determi ne how interventions that already exist in the school (e.g. nurture groups) are now focused on building specific resources within the child. In addition, there are new interventions that school staff can learn to use to target specific areas of resilient w ell-being in a child or a group of children together. Even 'hard- to-reach' children, who require more specialised professional support, will be helped using the same framework concepts and with the same targeted approach of building and nurturing the ' under -resourced' areas of their mental well -being. This was achieved in Swansea through three phases. Phase 1 - Whole -school training and p roactive interventions Primary school staff and p artner services - Team Around the Family ( TAF), educational psychology, behavioural support, youth workers - were introduced to the framework. This created a shared understanding of how the resource -based approach aligns itself with the natural psychological development of children. The emergence of a shared languag e of resilience began to be used to map the existing interventions and school -based activities to the three dimensions of psychological well-being. This opens up new opportunities for proactive support in the school. This can be having a ' Let's be f riends ' campaign across the school or it can be preparing 66 Year 6 for the transition to s econdary school through one of the Exchange Intervention Programmes ( e.g. The Big Adventure programme). Phase 2 - Recognising struggles and Identifying need in terms of being 'under -resourced ' Specific training to key pastoral teams to help staff apply the model where they observe that a learner is having difficulty (i.e. responsively) . A core aspect of application of the model is to be able to assess resilience and identify areas of strength and areas that are under -resourced: protective factors and resource- deficits. It is only from this that it is possible to create tailored support plans focused on strengthening areas of resource- deficit. This helped staff to become more focused in building psychological well -being because it provided a model of how to make best use of how current school -based provisions (ELSA, Nurture) support the specific dimensions of resilience and so support could be targeted. This reduced the number of referrals to specialist services The referrals that were made were more appropriate A shared joined- up language improved communication between professionals and aided consultations The right inteverntions were put in place to support under -resourced areas of resilience Phase 3 - Schools investing in enhancing skill sets for supporting psychological well -being Key pastoral staff and teachers were provided with training in a variety of intervention programmes designed to support children to build up the resources they need for healthy psychological development. Some themes include self -esteem, friendships, parental separation, transition, self -regulation and bereavement. The programmes improve the confidence of school staff when supporting the emotional and psychological well -being of children. Early intervention became readily accessible through trained staff in each school. This improved sustainability within the context of a w hole- school approach. 67 Annex 2: The strategic and legislative framework Legislation, strategy and guidance that supports the whole -school approach The Equality Act 201063 places a due regard duty on public authorities to: eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation advance equality of opportunity foster good relations between those who share a protected characteristic and those who do not. This may include removing or minimising disadvantage and taking steps to meet the needs of people from protected groups where their needs are different to other people's . The Welsh Government's Strategic Equality Plan 64, reiterates the objective to put the needs, rights and contributions of people with protected characteristics at the heart of the design and delivery of public services. The Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 65 came into force in April 2016 and seeks to improve the social, economic, environmental and cultural well - being of Wales. It makes public bodies think more about : the long -term work better with people, communities and each other look to prevent problems and take a more joined- up approach. The Act has seven well-being goals, shown in figure 1, creating a vision to (among other things ) make Wales healthier, more equal, globally responsible and more resilient. 63 gov.wales/equality 68 Figure 1: 7 well -being goals of the Act The UNCRC66 is the most complete statement of children's rights ever produced and is the most widely ratified international human rights treaty in history. In 2011 Wales became the first country in the UK to make the UNCRC part of its domestic law. Under the UNCRC 'a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.' Building on the UNCRC, the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 201167, was passed at the National Assembly for Wales in January 2011. The Measure strengthened and built on the rights -based approach of the Welsh Government to making policy for children and young people in Wales. It placed a duty on all Welsh Ministers to have due regard to the substantive rights and obligations within the UNCRC and its optional protocols. Prosperity for all - the national strategy 68 was published i n September 2017. It contains the Welsh Government's twelve s trategic objectives for 2017- 2021 and the steps it proposes to take to meet them. It includes improving mental health as one of its six priority areas for action. 66 gov.wales/childrens -rights (2016- 2021)69 is the Welsh Government's five- year plan to drive improvement in the Welsh economy and public services, delivering a Wales that is prosperous and secure, healthy and active, ambitious and learning, united and connected. It includes a commitment to work with schools, employers and other partners to improve well-being and promote better emotional health. Education in Wales : Our national mission 70 published in September 2017 sets out how we intend to improve the school system by developing transformational curriculum and assessment arrangements that place well-being at the heart of education. Enabling objective 3 (Strong and inclusive schools, committed to excellence, equity and well-being ) further states our intention to embed emotional well-being , ensuring it has the same status as physical well -being . Curriculum for Wales Framework 71 Includes the Cur riculum for Wales guidance and curriculum requirements set out in legislation. One of the four purposes of the new curriculum is to support children and young people to become healthy , confident individuals, building their mental and emotional well -being by developing confidence, resilience and empathy. The four purposes are at the heart of the new curriculum and schools will be required to develop a curriculum that enables learners to make progress towards these. mental and emotional well -being forms one o f the statements of w hat matters in the Health and Well -being Area of Learning and Experience. It is intended that these statements will be mandatory within a school's curriculum . The Health and Well -being Area of Learning and Experience draws on subjects and themes from mental, physical and emotional well -being. To inform and support the curriculum development process descriptions of l earning seek to articulate what it means for learners to progress in understanding and supporting their physical, mental and emotional well-being. The 'Designing your curriculum' section provides schools and practitioners with further detailed guidance on designing a curriculum to support learners' health and well -being. The Welsh Network of Healthy School Schemes 72 (WNHSS ) was launched in 1999 to encourage the development of local healthy school schemes within a national framework. Each local scheme is responsible for supporting the development of health- promoting schools within their area. The WNHSS describes a health- promoting school as one that 'actively promotes, protects and embeds the physical, mental and social health and well-being of its community through positive action'. This can be achieved through policy, strategic planning, staff develop ment, curriculum, ethos, physical environment and community relations. Within the scheme, there are seven different health topics 69 gov.wales/taking- wales -forward 70 - school -schemes -wnhss/ 70 that schools need to address , one of which is m ental and emotional health and well - being . Together for Mental Health73 a stra tegy for mental health and well -being in Wales (October 2012) sets out our priorities to improve the mental health of the nation and to tackle stigma and discrimination. It places improving the well -being of children and young people at its heart, recognising that by addressing issues early we can ameliorate more serious issues developing later in life. Social Services and Well -being (Wales) Act 2014 74 brings together local authorities' duties and functions in relation to improving the well -being of people who need care and support, and carers who need support, into a single Act. It provides the statutory framework to deliver the Welsh Government's commitment to focus on well-being, rights and responsibilit ies. The Welsh Government has issued Connected Communities: A strategy for tackling loneliness and social isolation and building stronger social connections 75, which recognises the impact that being lonely and/or socially isolated can have on our physical and mental well -being . It also deals with t he importance of the relationships we have with friends, family, colleagues and neighbours in giving us our sense of belonging and well-being. A Healthier Wales 76 sets out the Welsh Government's plan for a long -term future vision of a 'whole- system approach to health and social care', which is focused on health and well-being , and on preventing illness. Children Act 2004 77 builds on and strengthens the framework set out in the Children Act 1989, with provisions that relate directly or indirectly to agencies' responsibilities to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Additional Learning Needs and Educational Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 78 makes provision for a new statutory framework for supporting children and young people with ALN. 73 71 Youth Work Strategy for Wales79 and Implementation of the Youth Work Strategy for Wales80 sets out an ambitious programme of collaborative action intended to both improve youth work provision and our offer to young people. Mind over matter81 is a report by the Children, Young People and Education Committee of the National Assembly for Wales on the step change needed in emotional and mental health support for children and young people. The report made a number of recommendations, including several relating to the provision of support in education and on the development of the whole- school approach. The approach also fits with the Children's Commissioner's five Principles for a Children's Rights Approach82 as follows . 1. Embedding - Through this guidance schools and public services are encouraged to link their policies and services to children's rights under the UNCRC. All activities within a whole- school approach play a part in enabling children and young people to experience and take up their human ri ghts. 2. Equality and non- discrimination - This guidance enables schools to combat discrimination and stigma through universal and targeted provision and the requirement to pay attention to specific issues. 3. Empowerment - through learning about mental health and well -being and experiencing an environment where they are supported, learners experience greater opportunities to support their own health and those of others. 4. Participation - this guidance encourages learner s to be involved in developing, delivering and evaluating the whole- school approach through coproduction principles. 5. Accountability - the guidance expects a transparent governance structure to the whole- school approach and accountability to learners . Welsh Language Standards - The Welsh Language Wales Measure 201183 provides that the Welsh Ministers can specify five types of standards in regulations : service delivery standards , policy-making standards , operational standards , promotion standards , and record- keeping standards. Although it is the Welsh Ministers that specify the standards, it is for the Welsh Language Commissioner to decide which standards a body has to comply with. 79 gov.wales/youth- work -strategy -2019 "}
