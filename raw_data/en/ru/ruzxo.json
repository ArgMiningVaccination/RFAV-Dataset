The disease burden could be diminished by modification of existing risk factors. In addition to the traditional biomedical risk factors, psychological and behavioral risk factors have gained increasing attention because of their influence on CVD prognosis and onset.1 These risk factors are promising targets for intervention, as recommended goals for secondary prevention in patients are seldom reached. Conventional behavioral interventions in the cardiac population are related to several limitations, and research shows that \"one size does not fit all,\" implying the need for the implementation of more patient-tailored interventions using a precision medicine approach rooted from a psychological- and behavioral basis. Developments in the area of eHealth are promising in this respect, as these provide non-intrusive opportunities to further personalize interventions that can be up-scaled using new technologies. This dissertation provides insights into the role of psychological and behavioral lifestyle factors relevant to secondary prevention in patients with CVD using novel developments in personalized eHealth interventions. The WEBCARE randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed to replace or supplement face-to-face psychotherapy with an online platform in order to help patients with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) in managing distress in a low threshold manner. The Do CHANGE trial provided patients with CVD with ambulatory devices in combination with a behavioral eHealth intervention, targeting patients' willingness to engage in behavior change. The Do CHANGE trial provides insight in patients' objectively measured behavioral patterns and the feasibility of personalized eHealth interventions targeting behavioral mechanisms as secondary prevention within the CVD population. Both intervention studies underscore the importance of personalization in the development of future eHealth interventions in patients with CVD. This introduction provides a brief description of the subgroups of patients with CVD that might benefit eHealth interventions based on their demographic, psychological and/or clinical profile. The next section addresses biomedical, psychological, and behavioral lifestyle risk factors for CVD, which is followed by an overview of intervention studies. This chapter concludes with an overview of the two trials (WEBCARE and Do CHANGE), followed by the aims and outline of this dissertation. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, costing approximately 17 million lives annually.2 In Europe, 4 million deaths per year can be attributed to the effects of CVDs.2 Aside from the increased mortality risk, a substantial disease burden associated with morbidities and an additional increased demand on the healthcare system have been reported,3,4 resulting in a significant impact on medical care expenditures 3 and patients' quality of life.4 It is expected that the incidence and prevalence of CVDs will increase over the upcoming years as a consequence of aging world population.5 Cardiovascular disease is an umbrella term for a number of cardiac diseases, of which hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure encompass three preeminent common conditions.6,7 The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of the cardiovascular conditions that are relevant to the research projects presented in this dissertation, including patients with high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) who are eligible to receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Hypertension The global prevalence of hypertension amongst adults ranges between 30 and 45%, and is the most robust modifiable risk factor of morbidity and mortality from CVD.8 For pragmatic diagnostic and treatment reasons, cut-off scores of blood pressure values are used in clinical practice. The \"ideal\" blood pressure is defined as <120 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).9 The 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines define hypertension as the existence of office blood pressure values of at least 140 mmHg SBP and/or 90 mmHg DBP at multiple visits.9 Lower cut-off values have been proposed for patients with other CVD risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus or poor kidney function.9 In determining optimal treatment for hypertension, the advantages of antihypertensive drugs or lifestyle interventions must exceed the possible risks of the treatments targeting these optimal blood pressure levels.9 Coronary artery disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) pathogenesis is rooted in the development of atherosclerosis in the lumen of coronary arteries,7 which is partly caused by and can lead to endothelial dysfunction.10 A build-up of plaques (i.e. white blood cells, cholesterol, fat, blood platelets, and calcium) leads to a progressive narrowing of the arteries responsible for oxygen delivery to the myocardium (heart muscle)).11 Symptoms related to the narrowing of the coronary arteries entail angina pectoris (chest pain) and shortness of breath. In addition to the symptoms of obstructive CAD, the atherosclerotic plaques can rupture or a thrombus can be formed,7 resulting in myocardial infarction (permanent damage to the heart muscle) or other acute coronary syndromes (e.g., unstable angina pectoris).1 These acute coronary syndromes are often provoked, or triggered, by physical exercise and/or emotions.12 In stable CAD, oxygen delivery to the myocardium is partially or completely blocked, resulting in a deprivation of oxygen that leads to failure to meet the metabolic demand of the heart muscle 112 13GENERAL INTRODUCTION CHAPTER 1 cells.10 This ischemia may eventually result in myocardial cell necrosis and heart failure.10 Contingent upon the pathophysiology and disease severity, treatment options of CAD encompass pharmacological therapy (e.g. antiplatelet medication), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and/or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).12 For disease management, recommendations for lifestyle modification (e.g. maintain healthy weight, quit smoking) and CAD risk factor control are the key to improve prognosis.12 (see also below for details regarding CVD risk factors). Heart failure According to the ESC guidelines, heart failure is defined as a chronic and progressive cardiac abnormality, which is typified by clinical symptoms such as fatigue, edema, tachycardia, and dyspnea, that can be apparent both during stress and in rest.13 These are generally caused by inability of the left ventricle to eject or fill blood (i.e. systolic or diastolic left ventricular dysfunction) and/or increased intra-cardiac pressures.13 Heart failure is characterized by the heart not being able to pump enough blood through the body in order to meet the needs of organs for oxygen and nutrients.13 Symptom severity is often presented using the New York Heart Association functional classification (NHYA-class), which ranges from I (asymptomatic on ordinary physical activity) to IV (symptomatic during rest).13 The most common category of diagnosis are heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF: sometimes referred to as systolic heart failure) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (diastolic heart failure). HFrEFis characterized by reduced blood flow output and HFpEF by impaired blood flow input.14 The distinction is important in terms of risk stratification and clinical prognosis. Several underlying cardiac problems are identified that can contribute to the pathophysiology of heart failure (e.g. myocardial abnormalities, abnormalities in the valves, heart rhythm, conduction, heredity and these factors can coexist. The nature of heart failure (HFrEF or HFpEF) and the contributing etiologica factors determine the optimal therapeutic approach for patients with heart failure.13 Pharmacological therapy (e.g. beta blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors) and patient education related to lifestyle factors are treatment of choice in patients with a reduced LVEF.13 Also, reduction of risk factors for disease progression and/or decompensation are recommended (e.g. restricted dietary sodium and fluid intake)13 and requires the adoption of a healthy lifestyle: smoking cessation, lowering alcohol consumption, and engagement in regular physical activity.14 Cardiac arrhythmias and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy A considerable number of patients diagnosed with heart failure are at risk for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Cardiac arrhythmias can also occur in patients without heart failure and are caused by electrical conduction abnormalities in the heart muscle. These conduction abnormalities can result in major therapy is the first choice of treatment for patients at risk of SCD due to arrhythmias that are life-threatening, both as primary and secondary prevention.15 The ICD is inserted in a pocket underneath the skin, below the left clavicle, and is connected with one (single chamber), two (dual chamber), or three (biventricular) leads that go through a large vein into the heart.16 The rhythm and rate of the heart are constantly monitored, and in case of an arrhythmic event (dependent on the nature of the arrhythmia) the ICD delivers anti-tachycardia pacing (low-energy shocks) or an electronic shock (up to 800 volts) which aim to restore a normal heart beat.17 Compared to anti-arrhythmic drugs, ICD placement is associated with improved survival.18 RISKFACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE A variety of risk factors for the development and prognosis of CVD have been identified, and are often subdivided into non-modifiable (e.g. age, family history) and modifiable (e.g. smoking, sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary habits).19 These modifiable risk factors are profoundly suitable for targets of (behavioral) intervention, as their elimination could prevent 80% of the CVDs in the healthy population.1 Within the CVD population, a small modification of risk behaviours on an individual level would half the mortality rates.20 Furthermore, research shows that the combination of coexistent risk factors may increase the risk of adverse cardiac events in patients with CVD even more,21 indicating the complexity of underlying pathophysiological processes and their interplay with individual patient-related psychosocial and lifestyle factors in secondary prevention. Traditional risk factors Factors that are traditionally related to the onset and detrimental prognosis of CVD are the following: a history of (premature) CVD in the family,1 diabetes mellitus,22 hypertension,22 older age,1 male sex,1 high total cholesterol, elevated levels of low density lipid cholesterol (LDL-C), low levels of high density lipid cholesterol (HDL-C),23 and familial hyperlipidemia.22 Psychosocial risk factors Over the past years, evidence on the influence of psychosocial factors regarding the prognosis of CVD has become well-founded. Chronic and acute stressors (e.g. natural disasters, work related stress, grief),24 (clinical) depression,25,26 anxiety,27 post-traumatic 114 15GENERAL INTRODUCTION CHAPTER 1 stress syndrome (PTSS),28 personality traits (e.g. Type D personality, hostility),1,29 low perceived social support, and social isolation30 have been associated with an elevated risk of incident as well as recurrent CVD events. In addition to these psychological factors, several social factors have been associated with an increased risk of CVD as well, including low social-economic status (e.g. low educational level, low health literacy, low income),31 and some ethnic groups also have a higher risk of CVD.1 Mechanisms involved in the psychosocial risk factors for CVD The link between psychosocial factors and CVD can be explained by several behavioral as well as pathophysiological mechanisms. Biologically, psychological distress is associated with an altered activity of the autonomic nervous system via the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (i.e. sympathetic hyper reactivity and in dysregulated cortisol levels and/or desensitized glucocorticoid receptors.29 A cascade of hemodynamic (e.g. elevated blood pressure and heart rate), hemostatic (e.g. blood plasma from vessel into interstitial space), and immune (e.g. activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines) responses will be initiated as a consequence.29 These eventually may lead to endothelial dysfunction, coronary thrombosis, and adverse cardiac events (i.e. acute coronary syndrome, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and/or sudden cardiac death).29 Another important domain of mechanisms that is responsible for an additional proportion of risk of CVD progression involves an unhealthy lifestyle and low adherence to recommended behavior change (e.g., medication non-adherence, physical inactivity, smoking).1 Unhealthy lifestyle as CVD risk factor Several lifestyle factors have been identified as CVD risk factors because they increase the risk of premature death and CVD development. Smoking,32 an unhealthy diet (high salt, high saturated fat, low vegetable intake),33 a sedentary lifestyle,34 adiposity,1 high alcohol intake (more than two glasses per day or binge drinking),35 low medication adherence,1 and poor sleep36 are all associated with an increased risk of adverse CVD outcomes. A substantial lower CVD burden has been found for patients that adhere to a healthy lifestyle that consists of regular physical activity, non-smoking, normal body mass index (BMI), intake of fruit and vegetables, and light to moderate alcohol consumption.37INTERVENTIONS Psychological and behavioral interventions Despite the well-established substantial impact of modifiable psychosocial- and lifestyle risk factors on the onset and prognosis of CVD, recommended targets for secondary prevention in patients are scarcely reached.37 In order to reduce the impact of psychosocial and unhealthy lifestyle risk factors on CVD progression, sustained (health) behavior change is needed. Psychosocial behavioral interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy, stress-management therapy, psychoeducation) are promising with regard to behavior change in CVD patients.29,38 However , results on the efficacy of psychosocial interventions are generally inconclusive, with heterogeneous effect sizes.38 Furthermore, beneficial effects seem not to sustain on the long term,38 interventions are generally complex,39 time-consuming,40 face adherence difficulties,41 are limited by the potential extent of the amount of patients reached,42 may evoke stigma,43 and are not capable of intervening upon patients' real-time behavior (when an intervention is most needed and its efficacy is to be expected).40 Finally, previous research indicates that taking into account patients' preferences, needs, and characteristics (e.g. psychosocial- and clinical profile) is of utmost importance for an intervention to be beneficial.44 This evidence advocates a more patient-tailored approach in future interventions. Precision medicine as related to psychological and behavioral lifestyle interventions Precision medicine can be defined as \" an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability of genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person \".45 This approach of healthcare delivery relinquishes the traditional strategy of treating 'the average person'. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that benefit from treatment is highly heterogeneous among individuals.21,44 Hence, personalized clinical care has great potential to result in a more healthy life for patients, with less disease burden and decreased healthcare costs in the long term.46 However, currently this approach is mainly focused on the fields of genetics, molecular biology and bio informatics, leaving the individual differences in people's environments and lifestyles in respect of disease prevention and treatment understudied.47 Also, psychosocial characteristics48 provide an opportunity of combining medicine with behavioral sciences.49 This way, a more holistic approach of healthcare delivery might be attained, incorporating different aspects of the patients' life and therefore suiting the patients' needs to a greater degree. 116 17GENERAL INTRODUCTION CHAPTER 1 EHealth interventions With technology being adopted and developed on a broad scale in the past decades, delivery of web- and mobile health behavior interventions have become of major interest.50 EHealth can be defined as the delivery of remote clinical care, information, and services via Internet (web-based) or mobile technologies (mHealth),51 for example monitoring of disease symptoms via wearable sensors. Both seem to be promising with regard to the improvement of secondary prevention of CVD, by overcoming constraints that are associated with traditional face-to-face interventions.52 Innovations are developed that provide the opportunity for both patients and healthcare providers to use technology to optimize personalization and acquire more effective interventions by targeting patients' unique psychological and behavioral risk factors for CVD progression. They appear to be relatively affordable,50,53 can deliver interventions at any time and any place at the patients' own pace,54 are scalable and reach a broad range of underserved patients (e.g. immobile patients),53 and have the ability to monitor and intervene upon real-time (health) behavior and symptoms.41 As a consequence, monitored data can directly be transmitted to healthcare professionals, which in turn could preventing worsening of symptoms, hospitalizations, or even mortality.53 As 'by-product', massive amounts of data, which can be used for further intervention development, can be stored and analyzed.55 In addition, patients can use their own data in order to enhance disease self-management.56 Despite these aforementioned potentials, the evidence base for implementation of eHealth interventions in the cardiac population is lacking, and the efficacy is generally of minimal impact to date.57 Important shortcomings in previous studies are small sample sizes, short follow-up duration, poor methodological qualities, and high drop- out rates.58 In addition, intervention modalities and characteristics, (the amount of) targeted behaviors, and details regarding the behavioral interventions are often poorly described,58 resulting in a wide diversity of non-comparable intervention formats that do not elicit which and how components contribute to potential intervention efficacy.54 Hence, more research is needed in order to disentangle which components of eHealth interventions are the ones that drive the effectiveness. In order to gain more insight in the effectiveness and the underlying mechanism of eHealth interventions, this dissertation describes two eHealth trials: WEBCARE and Do CHANGE. Below a detailed description of the trials is provided.THE WEBCARE TRIAL Using internet as a platform to implement traditional psychological interven - tion for distress reduction In The WEB-based distress management program for implantable CARdioverter dEfibrillator patients (WEBCARE), a psychological intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy aimed to reduce distress in ICD patients was delivered through an online, low-threshold web-based platform. Within this multidisciplinary, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, first-time implant ICD patients were recruited from six Dutch referral hospitals (Amphia Hospital, Breda; Canisius-Wilhelmina 289 patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to either the WEBCARE intervention group (N = 1 46) or the care as usual group (N = 1 43).59 All participants were asked to complete standardized baseline questionnaires five to ten days after the ICD implantation, in order to rule out the possible effect of pre-operative stress on aimed outcome measures. Figure 1 presents the schematic representation of the complete study procedure, including follow-up time points. Aims The WEBCARE trial aimed to reduce device concerns and levels of anxiety, and improve quality of life. A detailed description and main results of the WEBCARE trial have been published previously.43,60 Intervention Patients randomized to the treatment group received a 12-week web-based behavioral intervention that started two weeks post-implantation and consisted of six lessons that were based on problem-solving therapy in combination with components of psycho-education, cognitive restructuring, and relaxation training.43 Via a personal username and password, patients were able to access the intervention on the internet. Participants received an automated email on a weekly basis, explaining the content and exercises for the upcoming week. Proceeding to a next lesson was only enabled after the former was completed. Feedback on the homework exercises was provided by master's level psychology students, who spent 60 minutes on feedback per participant on average. The pace of completing the intervention was guided by patients' own preference and time availability. After 12 weeks, the patient's access to the account was closed.59,61 Chapters 2, 3, and 4 present results of the WEBCARE trial. 118 19GENERAL INTRODUCTION CHAPTER 1 FIGURE 1. Overview of follow-up of the WEBCARE intervention THE DO CHANGE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL Using mobile apps as a way to facilitate behavioral change Do Cardiac Health: Advanced New Generation Ecosystem (Do CHANGE) is a multicenter, international (The Netherlands, Spain, Taiwan), randomized controlled trial (intervention versus care as usual) that was designed to enhance lifestyle behavior change in patients diagnosed with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure.62 Patients in the intervention group received self-monitoring devices (e.g. Fitbit, blood pressure monitor, ECG measurement) in order to get insight in their own health status and behavior. Furthermore, they participated in a behavior change program (Do Something Different) that was focused on encouraging patients to get out of their comfort zone. This was done by sending patients 'prompts' (called \"Do's\") via text messages, encouraging patients to do something else than they would usually do. For example: \"LET'S GO DAY. Today plan some fun for the weekend. Book up somewhere, plan an outing, arrange a fun get-together with friends or family now \". It was believed that this would lead to a bigger behavioral repertoire and flexibility, which would make breaking with old habits and adoption of a more healthy lifestyle.63,64 These Do's were sent based on the patients' personality profile that was established before the start of the intervention. This project consists of two distinct studies, of which the results of the Do CHANGE 1 project served as input for the development and refinement of the Do CHANGE 2 trial.Aims The primary aim of the Do CHANGE trials was to evaluate the feasibility of a multi- faceted eHealth intervention on the modification of unhealthy lifestyles and improve disease management of cardiac patients. Furthermore, the effect of the intervention on quality of life and change in behavioral flexibility was examined. Feasibility, satisfaction and usability of the intervention were examined as secondary outcomes. Exploratory objectives of this study served as input for new insights into successful lifestyle change. In this respect, subgroups of patients that might benefit the most based on their psychological and/or disease profile were examined. Also, the effects of the intervention on patients' (real-time) blood pressure values, sleep- and activity patterns over a prolonged period of time were assessed. Assessments of patient reported outcomes were performed at baseline (T0), at 3 (T1), and 6 months (T2) after enrollment. The study design of Do CHANGE has previously been published elsewhere.62 The general study design is briefly summarized here (see also: www.do-change.eu). Do CHANGE 1 intervention With regard to the first Do CHANGE trial, we aimed to include 1 50 patients (N = 75 CAU & N = 75 intervention). For the first three months, patients randomized to the intervention group received a Careportal (i.e. home monitoring system where patients were asked to insert their blood pressure values, weight, ECG, and symptoms on a daily basis), were asked to install the Moves app for GPS location, and received the Do Something Different behavioral program (i.e. 'prompts') (see Figure 2). FIGURE 2. Overview of the Do CHANGE 1 intervention timeline 120 21GENERAL INTRODUCTION CHAPTER 1 Do CHANGE 2 intervention As previously mentioned, information regard acceptability of the intervention from the Do CHANGE 1 trial was used in order to further develop the Do CHANGE 2 trial. These two trials therefore differ from each other to some extent. Data on average step- count, mode of transportation, and data coverage from the first trial were translated to algorithms on which 'sufficient' scores on activity was calculated. Do's within the second trial were sent by mobile phone to target scores that were below the sufficient cut-off. Some \"Dos\" were selected on constellation between the higher and the lower scores to increase the likelihood of being completed. The second trial of the Do CHANGE study focused more specifically on additional wearable lifestyle devices. Also, three countries (Spain, Taiwan, and The Netherlands) participated in this trial in order to enlarge the cultural generalizability of the findings. The aim was to include N = 250 participants in total (N = 125 CAU & N = 125 intervention). In addition to the Careportal and Moves app, patients randomized to the intervention group were also provided with the Fitbit Alta HR (activity tracker), Beddit (sleep tracker), and Vire app. This application integrated all incoming information from all wearables in order for the patient not to feel overwhelmed. Patients were also asked to send pictures of their meals via the Vire app during the day. Figure 3 shows the different technologies used within the trial (These devices and their use are described in more detail in Chapter 5 of this dissertation). Based on the incoming information, the Do's of DSD were generated and tailored to the patients' individual behavior in daily life. The duration of the behavioral program was three months, thereafter the prompts were no longer sent to participants. However, patients kept using the wearables for the complete follow-up period of six months (see Figure 4). In this way, it was possible to get insight into the objectively measured sustained effects (e.g. step count) of the behavioral intervention. Information on the collected data, including clinical data like ECG and blood pressure values, could be looked into by the cardiologist via a platform that was accessible by a protected internet connection. In this way, the cardiologist could intervene upon cardiac symptoms when necessary. FIGURE 3. Overview of the different devices used within the Do CHANGE 2 intervention.65-68 122 23GENERAL INTRODUCTION CHAPTER 1 FIGURE 4. Overview of follow-up of the Do CHANGE 2 intervention AIMS AND OUTLINE OF THIS DISSERTATION The aim of this dissertation is to shed light on the role of patient characteristics on health, and to examine the feasibility and the underlying mechanism of behavioral eHealth interventions for cardiac patients. The final aim is to emphasize the importance of further personalization in the development of future eHealth interventions in patients with CVD, by examining subgroups of patients that might optimally benefit based on their individual psychological, clinical or sociodemographic profile. Figure 5 provides an overview of the characteristics of the two distinct eHealth trials that are presented in this dissertation. Part I Patient characteristics and health: the WEBCARE trial The first part of this dissertation focuses primarily on the investigation of psychological determinants that predict health outcomes related to the prognosis in the ICD patient population. In Chapter 2 , the effect of optimism on mental- and physical health status and psychological distress is addressed. Despite the medical benefits, ICD therapy is associated with a risk of complications and, in turn, with elevated levels of healthcare usage. Whether patients' demographic, medical, and psychological characteristics in the ICD population predict healthcare utilization is unclear and is examined in Chapter 3. As the final chapter of the first part, Chapter 4 examines the association of personality (optimism, pessimism, and Type D personality) with all-cause mortality and ventricular arrhythmias, 6 years after first-time ICD implantation.Part II Mobile applications to enhance behavioral change: The Do CHANGE trial Part two of this dissertation explores whether the implementation of an eHealth intervention based on mobile apps, wearable trackers, and self-monitoring is feasible in the clinical practice. Chapter 5 provides a detailed overview and description of the Do CHANGE trial protocol, including information on the wearable- and self-monitoring devices and behavioral intervention. In Chapter 6 , the feasibility of the Do CHANGE 1 trial is examined. In addition, the preliminary effect of the intervention on patient reported behavioral flexibility, lifestyle promoting behavior, and quality of life is assessed. The effect of the Do CHANGE 2 trial on patient reported lifestyle behavior and quality of life is provided in Chapter 7 . In addition, more insight into personalization was regained by determining latent classes of the primary outcomes (i.e. lifestyle behavior, quality of life) and examining whether these are related to patients' demographic, psychological, and clinical profile. Chapter 8 evaluates whether objectively measured, real-life, lifestyle- and health data (i.e. step-count, physical activity, blood pressure values, sleep efficiency) derived from wearable devices used in the Do CHANGE 2 trial changes over time. The secondary analysis of patients' clinical, psychosocial, and demographic predictors that are associated with improvement or deterioration of these measures provides more insight into new patient characteristics that could serve as target for the development of future eHealth interventions. This dissertation is concluded by a general discussion of the research findings and clinical implications for eHealth applications in patients with cardiovascular diseases in Chapter 9 . 124 25GENERAL INTRODUCTION CHAPTER 1 FIGURE 5.

However, a subgroup of ICD patients experiences psychological adjustment problems post implant. To date, positive psychological constructs (e.g. optimism) have been understudied in this population. Hence, we examined the association between optimism and anxiety, depression, and health status at 12-months post implant. Methods: Patients (N=171) enrolled in the WEB-based distress management study for ICD patients were included in the analyses. Optimism and pessimism (LOT), and Type D personality (DS14) were administered at baseline, while anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and health status (SF-12) were assessed at 12-months. Results: The mean age was 59.6\u00b110.06 with 81% being male. After controlling for demographic, personality, and clinical variables, baseline optimism was associated with lower anxiety (=-.210; p=.011) and depression (=-.222; p=.005), and better physical mental health status (=.350; p=.000) at follow-up. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that optimism is associated with less distress and possibly helps safeguard mental health in ICD patients. Increase optimism might be the way forward to reduce long-term distress and impaired health status.INTRODUCTION The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the treatment of choice for patients who have experienced a sudden cardiac arrest (secondary prevention) or who are at increased risk of experiencing one in the future (primary prevention).1 In case of potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia's, the ICD is able to deliver an electric shock to the heart muscle and prevent sudden cardiac arrest.1 Although the majority of ICD patients adapt well to living with an ICD, a subgroup experiences adjustment problems, which are largely unrecognized and untreated.2 Approximately 25% - 33% of patients experience distress (e.g. anxiety and depression) and decreased quality of life (QoL)3,4 which, in turn, are associated with (long-term) adverse outcomes, including arrhythmias and mortality.5,6 Hence, it is of great importance to identify patients who are at risk of developing adjustment problems in order to optimize their care. An increasing number of studies have focused on identifying risk factors for distress and impaired QoL in ICD patients. These findings have shown that younger age,7 frequent shocks,4 Type D personality,8 heart failure,9 negative treatment expectations,10 poor understanding of their medical condition,4 and diabetes11 are associated with increased risk of distress and/ or impaired QoL post ICD implant. While the majority of the studies focused on negative correlates (e.g. patients' weaknesses), a paucity of studies have focused on patients' strengths (e.g. optimism) and their possible protective association with patient reported outcomes. Optimistic people are characterized by their (overall) positive expectancy about future outcomes, pessimists, on the other hand, generally hold a more negative expectancy about the future.12 Whether a person is an optimist or pessimist highly affects the way he/ she copes with difficulties in life, with optimists adapting generally more effective coping strategies.13 Optimism has shown to be associated with both psychological and physical well-being in the general population14 and in patients with chronic diseases.15,16 Within the cardiac population, optimism has been associated with rate of recovery after cardiac surgery,17 adherence to cardiac health-related behaviors,18,19 less re- hospitalizations,20,21 and even decreased risk of mortality.22 Despite the observed association between optimism and better (mental) health in other populations, optimism and its potentially protective effect in ICD patients has received little attention. One small-scale study of 88 ICD patients found a positive association between optimism and QoL.15,23 Others reported that optimism is the most frequently used and most effective coping strategy among ICD patients.24 To our knowledge, no studies have focused on the association between optimism and long-term outcomes 236 37OPTIMISM AS PREDICTOR OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS CHAPTER 2 in ICD patients. Hence, in the current study, we examined whether baseline optimism is associated with patient-reported anxiety, depression, and health status 12-months post implant. METHODS Study design For the current study, we used data from the WEB-based distress management program for implantable CARdioverter dEfibrillator patients (WEBCARE) trial [NCT00895700]. A detailed description of the trial and the primary results have been published elsewhere.25,26 Briefly, WEBCARE was a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of an online behavioral intervention aiming to reduce distress and increase quality of life in patients with an ICD. Patients were assessed at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12 months post ICD implant. The intervention was not superior to usual case, neither with respect to primary nor secondary outcomes. 26 For the current study, baseline and 12 months follow up data were used. Participants Patients (N=171), who were admitted for a first-time ICD implant, were included between April 2010 and February 2013 at 6 Dutch referral hospitals ( Amphia Hospital, Breda; part of the WEBCARE trial. All patients who had a first-time ICD implant, were 18-75 years, had adequate Internet/computer skills, and had sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language were eligible to participate. Patients who had significant cognitive impairments (e.g. dementia), history of psychiatric illness other than affective/anxiety disorders, life-threatening co-morbidities (e.g. cancer), a life expectancy less than 1 year, or were on the waiting list for heart transplantation were excluded. Study procedure Prior to or briefly after ICD implantation patients were approached for participation. The ICD nurse or technician provided the patient with study information both orally and in writing. Patients who fulfilled all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, and who were willing to participate, signed the informed consent form and were asked to complete the baseline questionnaires. Patients were instructed to complete the questionnaires within 10 days after ICD implantation and return them in a pre-stamped envelope to Tilburg University. If the questionnaires were not returned within 2 weeks, patients received up to 3 reminder phone calls. Baseline information on clinical characteristics was obtained from patients' medical records at the participating hospitals. For follow-up assessment, patients received a set of questionnaires per mail and were again instructed to fill them in within 1 week and send them back to Tilburg University. If the questionnaires were not received within 2 weeks, patients received up to 3 reminder phone calls. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the participating hospitals. Measures Demographic, clinical, and Type D personality data were collected at baseline. Data on optimism and pessimism, anxiety, depression, and health status were obtained at 12-months follow-up. Demographic and clinical variables Information on demographic (age, gender, working status, marital status, education level) and clinical data (New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, ICD indication, Charlson Comorbidity Index, medication) were obtained from patients' medical records and baseline questionnaires. Optimism and pessimism Optimism was assessed using the Dutch version of the Life Orientation Test (LOT).27 The LOT questionnaire contains 12 items of which 4 items tap into the construct of optimism (e.g. In uncertain times, I usually expect the best ) and 4 items into the construct of pessimism (e.g. I hardly ever expect thing to go my way ). The 4 remaining items are referred to as 'filler items' and are not part of the sum scores. Items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 ( very much disagree ) to 4 ( very much agree ). The 'pessimism' questions are reverse scored and the total scale sum score ranges between 0 and 32 with higher scores indicating higher optimism. The LOT has previously been used also assess optimism and pessimism separately. The total scores of the sub scales range between 0 and 16, with a higher score indicating higher levels of the respective trait. Anxiety Symptoms of anxiety were assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD- 7).28 The GAD-7 is a 7-item questionnaire assessing anxiety symptoms (e.g. Feeling 238 39OPTIMISM AS PREDICTOR OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS CHAPTER 2 nervous, anxious or on the edge) on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all ) to 3 (almost every day) .28 The total score ranges between 0 and 21 with a higher score indicating higher anxiety levels. Depression Symptoms of depression were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9).29 The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report questionnaire that taps into the 9 diagnostic criteria for DSM-IV depressive disorder (e.g. Having little interest or pleasure in doing things) .29 Items are evaluated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 ( not at all ) to 3 (almost every day ). The total score can range between 0 and 27, with higher scores indicating higher levels of depression symptomatology. The PHQ-9 was recently validated in the DEFIB-Women cohort, which was a large nationwide study of patients with a first-time ICD, focusing on gender differences in patient-reported and clinical outcomes.30 Health status Patients' physical and mental health status was assessed with the Short-Form Health Survey 12 (SF-12).31 Via an algorithm items on the SF-12 can be converted into a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) sand Mental Component Summary score (MCS) with a score range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status. Type D (distressed) personality We used the Type D Scale (DS14) to measure Type D personality.32 The DS14 consists of two 7-item subscales measuring Negative Affectivity (e.g . I often feel unhappy ) and Social Inhibition (e.g. I am a 'closed' kind of person) . Items are evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (false) to 4 (true). The total scores on both subscale range between 0 and 28. A score of 10 on both scales defines individuals as having a Type D personality.33 Type D personality has previously been associated with distress34 and lower health status in cardiac patients,35 hence, in the current study Type D personality will be include as a covariate. Statistical analyses Continuous and discrete variables were compared using Student's T-test and the Chi2 test, respectively. A factor analysis was performed to examine whether the LOT scale can be considered as unidimensional or bi-dimensional. To assess the association between baseline optimism and anxiety, depression and health status, hierarchical (3 levels) linear regression was performed. For the primary analysis in the first model, demographic variables (age, gender, marital status, education level, working status) and optimism (unidimensional) were entered, in de second model psychological variables were added (Type D personality), in the third model clinical variables were entered (NYHA class, ICD indication, Charlson Comorbidity Index, medication). For secondary analysis the bi-dimensional structure of the LOT was used in the 3 hierarchical models. Optimism was added as of the first model while in model 2 pessimism was also added as a covariate. The other covariates remained as in the primary analyses. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 for Windows [IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.]. All tests were two-tailed and an alpha of .05 was used to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS Patient characteristics A total of 1024 patients were approached for participation in the WEBCARE trial of which 492 did not meet the inclusion criteria and 192 refused to participate. A total of 340 patients signed the informed consent form. Of these patients, 15% (51/340) did not return the baseline questionnaires, resulting in 289 patients being randomized to intervention (N=146) versus care as usual (N=143). Of these 289 patients, 58 (20%) patients had no data on clinical or psychological measures and were excluded from analyses. Additional 60 (26%) patients had no follow-up measurement and were excluded from analyses (Figure 1). 240 41OPTIMISM AS PREDICTOR OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS CHAPTER 2 FIGURE 1. Flow chart of patient recruitment. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the sample. The mean age of the sample was 59.6\u00b110.06 with the majority of patients being male (81%). Patients who were not included in the analyses were younger (56.7\u00b110.37; p=.009), more likely to be employed ( 2= 9.32; p=.002), more likely to have as secondary prevention ( 2= 4.88; p=.027), ( 2= 9.92; p=.002) as compared to patients who were in the analyses. Factor structure LOT Although the unidimensional use of the LOT has been advocated,36 the factor analysis of the current sample revealed a clear 2 factor structure (optimism and pessimism) of the LOT questionnaire. The correlation between the constructs was r=.378. This indicates that the scale most likely measures two distinct constructs. Hence, the bi-dimensional structure of the LOT was examined in the secondary analysis.

This association indicated that higher baseline optimism scores are associated with lower anxiety and depression scores at 12-months follow up after controlling for demographic, psychological and clinical variables. Further to these findings, Type D personality (Anxiety: significantly associated with distress at 12 months follow-up. The results did not change significantly after performing the secondary analysis with the bi-dimensional structure (results not shown). In both, primary and secondary analysis the predictive ability 242 43OPTIMISM AS PREDICTOR OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS CHAPTER 2 of optimism decreased after adding covariates to the model, however, it remained significant. Optimism and Health Status A significant association between optimism and physical health status was observed (=.227; p=.004) and with mental health status (=.350; p=.000), indicating that higher baseline optimism is associated with increased physical and mental health status at 12-months follow up (Table 2). Significant association were also observed between working status (=.200; p=.019), NYHA class (=-.230; p=.002), and medical comorbidity (=-.224; p=.005) and physical health status. Mental health status was associated with NYHA class (=-.142; p=.047) and medical comorbidity (=-.207; p=.007.) Performing the secondary analysis, with the bi-dimensional construct, revealed that optimism was not associated with physical health status (=.097; p=.213), while a significant association with mental health status was observed (=.213; p=.005). Focusing on the two subscales (of health status) separately, significant associations were observed between working status (=.197; p=.021), pessimism (=-.223; p=.005) and physical health status. Besides optimism, significant associations with the mental health status subscale were observed with pessimism (=-.209; and medical comorbidity (=-.208; p=.007). Comparable to the findings with distress, the predictive ability of optimism decreased after adding more covariates to the model, nevertheless, it remained significant.

We found that patients who were more optimistic at the time of implant experienced lower levels of anxiety and depression and a better physical and mental health status 1 year post implantation independent of relevant demographic, psychological, and clinical factors. The predictive ability of optimism decreased after adding additional covariates to the model, indicating that these variables may serve as mediators between optimism and outcome measures. These findings are in line with previous studies conducted in the general population14 and other cardiac samples.18,37 In the secondary analysis we found no significant association between optimism and physical health status when using the bi-dimensional structure of the LOT questionnaire (optimism and pessimism as subscales). Within the ICD population, studies have demonstrated the protective value of optimism on both mental and physical health status.15,23 A possible explanation for this difference could be the fact that different variables were entered in the prediction models. As opposed to previous studies, due to a relatively large sample size, we were able to control for multiple clinical measures, which might have a greater impact on patients' physical health status than optimism. Surprisingly, while Type D personality and medical comorbidity were associated with anxiety and depression at 12-months follow up, pessimism did not show a significant association with distress. Based on previous findings showing a significant association between pessimism and negative treatment expectations,10 it was expected that pessimism (like negative treatment expectations) would be associated with distress at follow-up. This further underlines the difference between the construct of pessimism and negative treatment expectations. Pessimism, NYHA class, and medical comorbidity were all associated with mental and physical health status. In addition, working status was also associated with physical status. These findings indicate that optimism and pessimism independently predict different patient-reported outcomes and should perhaps be treated as two distinct constructs. Hence, presence of optimism does not implying the absence of pessimism, and vice versa.16 The association of optimism with psychological well-being and health outcomes in patients with chronic diseases has gained some attention over the past decades. Having confidence in the future and being optimistic has been associated with increased QoL among cancer patients,38 and lower distress in patients with HIV39 and diabetes.40 In addition, being optimistic has been associated with better coping strategies and better health behaviors,12 and better health outcomes21 in the cardiac population. Patients who use optimism as a coping mechanism might adjust easier to new situations and /or recover faster after an event.24 This means that these patients may display lower health care needs as compared to patients who tend to expect negative outcomes. Hence, current findings might have implications for clinical practice, with lower scores on optimism and higher scores on pessimism in patients at the time of implantation serving as a red flag that these patients are at risk for poorer patient-reported outcomes. In addition, increasing optimism as means of prevention might contribute to a better health across population. A number of studies have demonstrated the benefit of positive psychology interventions aiming to increase patients' strengths such as optimism.41 These interventions focus on positive patient characteristics and experience of positive emotions in order to enhance outcomes (e.g. well-being, health behaviors etc.).42-45 These interventions can be delivered within a short timeframe (1-2 weeks)42,45 and could be offered as part of prevention (prior to implantation) or shortly after implantation either face-to- face, in group sessions, or even online.43,46 As previous studies show that optimism is the most frequently used and most effective coping strategy among ICD patients,24 increasing optimism might contribute to the development of better, more effective, coping strategies which patients could also apply to other life events. In turn, this could eventually lead to better health behaviors, decreased distress, better well-being and possibly better health / cardiac outcomes. A number of limitations of this study must be acknowledged. First, a significant number of patients were excluded from current analyses due to not meeting the inclusion criteria or not having data on baseline or follow up measures. This might have resulted in a bias towards patients who are more motivated to participate and less severely ill. In addition, the current sample comprised a lower number of patients with a Type D personality as compared to other ICD samples.5 This may indicate a bias toward more positive patients making the results less generalizable to the overall ICD population. Second, patient-reported outcome measures were assessed using standardized self- report questionnaires rather than a clinical diagnosis of anxiety and depression. Third, we did not have data on other positive affect measures to examine the magnitude of these associations. However, this is the first study to examine the long-term association of optimism and distress. Due to the relatively large number of patients and 12-months follow up, we were able to examine long-term associations controlling for a significant number or relevant variables. Finally, current findings should be interpreted with caution because the observed effects, although significant, are relatively small. Nevertheless, our findings warrant future studies to further explore the role of positive psychological constructs in patient-reported and clinical outcomes in patients with an ICD. Enhancing patients' strengths through increased focus on optimism might be the way forward with respect to reducing long-term negative outcomes. From previous ICD studies we know that distress abates over time and QoL improves (without any 246 47OPTIMISM AS PREDICTOR OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS CHAPTER 2 intervention) up to around 3-5 months' post implant and that the majority of patients adapts well to living with an ICD.3,26 However, there is a significant subgroup who might need additional, low threshold support, to learn how to cope with living with an ICD. Making the patients more resilient with short, and relatively simple positive psychology interventions, might be less demanding while perhaps sufficient to help them cope with their new life situation. Hence, evaluation of positive psychology interventions for ICD patients in large scale randomized controlled trials is warranted to inform clinical practice. Further to this, future studies should focus on possible mediators (e.g. lifestyle) of optimism and health outcomes in order to disentangle the mechanism(s) behind the association. In conclusion, our findings showed that optimism is associated with less anxiety / depression and better mental health status, while pessimism was associated with impaired mental and physical health status. These findings underline the importance of identifying patients with lower optimism at the time of implant and focusing on enhancing patients' strengths in order for patients to live as full a life as possible with their device and their disease.

We examined the level of HCU and predictors associated with increased HCU in first- time ICD patients, using a prospective study design. Methods: ICD patients (N = 201) completed a set of questionnaires at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12 months after inclusion. A hierarchical multiple linear regression with 3 models was performed to examine predictors of HCU. Results: HCU was highest between baseline and 3 months post-implantation and gradually decreased during 12 months follow-up. During the first year post implantation, only depression ( = 0.342, p = 0.002) was a significant predictor. Between baseline and 3 months follow-up, younger age ( = -.220, p < .01), NYHA class III/IV ( = .705, p = .01), and secondary indication ( = .148, p = .05) were independent predictors for increased HCU. Between 3 and 6 months follow-up, younger age ( = -.151, p = .05) and depression ( =.370, p <.001) predicted increased HCU. Between 6 and 12 months only depression ( = 0.355, p = 0.001) remained a significant predictor. Conclusions: Depression was an important predictor of increased HCU in ICD patients in the first year post implantation, particularly after 3 months post implantation. Identifying patients who need additional care and provide this on time might better meet patients' needs and lower future healthcare utilization.INTRODUCTION The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the treatment of choice for the prevention of potentially life-threatening cardiac tachyarrhythmia's in high-risk patients (primary prevention) and in patients who have experienced cardiac tachyarrhythmia's in the past (secondary prevention).1 The ICD constantly monitors the heart rate and in case of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia delivers a shock in order to restore a normal rhythm.2 Because of the proven benefits of the ICD as compared to antiarrhythmic medication terminating tachyarrhythmia's,3 the number of ICD implants has increased over the past years, although a plateau now has been reached in at least many European countries.4 Besides the unequivocal medical benefits, ICD therapy is associated with a risk of complications and increased health care costs have been reported.5 Receiving an ICD is associated with high health care costs as the implantation device itself can be as expensive as 30.000 euros.6 In addition, after implantation, patients are generally followed-up at 1-to-4 month intervals (depending on patients' clinical status and device model) at the outpatient clinic.2 These follow-ups are generally performed by the ICD technicians but may also involve a consult by the cardiologist in case of complications (e.g. wound infections, lead failure), which may result in even higher health care expenses.5 Be s i d e s p a t i e n ts' m e d i ca l n e e d s wit h r e s p e ct t o l ivi n g wit h a n I C D , a significant subgroup (1 in 5) reports symptoms of anxiety and depression at a level that warrants treatment7 and that affect patients' physical- and mental functioning.8 In turn, this may lead to a further increase in health care utilization (HCU) and associated costs. Previous studies have shown that an increase of HCU depends on patients' demographic, medical, and psychological characteristics (e.g. multi-morbidity, mental health disorders).9 As some of these factors are modifiable, it is important to timely identify this subset of patients at the time of implantation and to provide patients with relevant care in order to reduce HCU and associated costs. To the best of our knowledge, no studies to date have examined the level of HCU and its predictors in the ICD population. Hence, in the current study we examined the level of HCU and the predictors of increased HCU and costs in patients with an ICD. METHODS Participants and study procedure Data for the current study have been collected as part of the WEB-based distress management program for implantable CARdioverter dEfibrillator patients (WEBCARE), which was a multi-center randomized controlled trial.10 The study sample consisted of patients who were admitted for a first-time implantation of an ICD. Patients were recruited between April 2010 and February 2013 from six Dutch referral hospitals 354 55HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION IN PATIENTS WITH CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATORS CHAPTER or ICD nurse of the participating hospitals approached all patients between 18 and 75 years who received a first-time ICD implant for participation. Exclusion criteria were a history of psychiatric illness other than depressive or anxiety disorders, significant cognitive impairments (e.g. dementia), being on the waiting list for heart transplantation, life-threatening co-morbidities (e.g. malignancies), life expectancy less than one year, lack of internet/computer skills, and insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language. In the one-year follow-up period after the ICD implantation, patients were requested to complete a set of validated and standardized questionnaires at four time-points (baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12 months after inclusion). The study procedure has been described elsewhere in more detail. The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethical Committees of all participating centres and the study was conducted in accordance to the Helsinki declaration. Demographic and clinical variables Information on demographic (age, gender, educational level) and clinical variables (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (NYHA-class I/II versus III/IV), ICD indication (primary versus secondary indication), and total shocks (appropriate and inappropriate) was obtained from purpose-designed questions in the questionnaires and patients' medical records. Healthcare Utilization An adjusted version of the T rimbos/iMT A questionnaire for Costs associated with Psychiatric Illness (TiC -P) was used to assess HCU in the WEBCARE population.11 This generic patient self-report survey includes 14 structured yes/no questions on relevant medical resources (e.g. 'Did you consult with a General Practitioner at any time during the past three months' ).11 Each item is followed by a question on the frequency of utilization of that specific medical resource over the past three months. For example, the baseline score represents the HCU within the 3 months prior to ICD implantation, while the 3 months score reflects HCU between baseline and 3 months post implantation. For the current study, only the items referring to medical resource use (e.g. General Practitioner, company doctor, physiotherapist, and outpatient hospital visits) were used, whereas current sample is not a psychiatric population and psychological HCU was reported sporadically. The reliability and validity of the medical resource items are considered satisfactory (Cohen's kappa ranges from 0.597 to 0.795) within the population of patients with mild to moderate mental health problems,11 and is previously used within the cardiac population.12 Anxiety Symptoms of anxiety were assessed with the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). The GAD-7 items (e.g. \"Feeling afraid, as if something awful might happen \") are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (almost every day).13 The total score implies severity of anxiety and ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating higher anxiety levels. With a Cronbach's alpha of 0.92, the internal consistency of the GAD-7 is considered excellent.13 Depression Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a patient self-report survey which is comprised of 9 items (e.g. \" Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless \") that are answered on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day).14 The score range is between 0 and 27, with higher scores representing a higher level of depression symptom severity. The internal consistency is considered excellent, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.90.14 Type D personality Type D (distressed) personality was assessed with the DS14 (Type D scale).15 This questionnaire consists of 14 items with two 7-item subscales measuring Social Inhibition (e.g. \"I find it hard to start a conversation\" ) and Negative Affectivity (e.g . \"I am often in a bad mood\") . The items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (false) to 4 (true). The total score of both subscales range from 0 to 28. Patients are classified as Type D when scoring 10 on both subscales. The internal consistency of SI and NA are considered satisfactory, with reported Cronbach's alphas of 0.86 and 0.88, respectively.15 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics of the baseline variables were evaluated using frequencies (categorical variables) and mean scores with standard deviations (SD) (continuous variables). They are presented as percentages and means \u00b1 SDs, respectively. Differences between non-responders and participants on baseline characteristics were calculated by using the 2 test for independence (categorical variables) and independent sample t-tests (continuous variables). Missing data was handled by using pairwise deletion (available-case analysis). In order to assess whether a priori determined demographic characteristics (age, gender, and education), clinical variables (NYHA class, ICD indication, total shocks (appropriate and inappropriate), CCI, and psychological 356 57HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION IN PATIENTS WITH CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATORS CHAPTER 3 variables (anxiety, depression, and Type D personality) were associated with total HCU in ICD patients the first year after implantation, a sum score was calculated for the number of health care use during the 12 month period. Baseline measurement for the sum score was excluded, as this score reflects HCU before the ICD implantation. Generalized linear modelling was used to investigate the change in HCU over time. As HCU is considered count data, a Poisson distribution with log linear link function was used to model HCU scores over time. Time was modelled as a continuous variable because the intervals between the measurements were unequally spaced. A hierarchical multivariable regression with 3 models was performed in order to examine the predictors of HCU. Demographic characteristics were entered in the first model . In the second model, clinical variables were entered, followed by the psychological variables in the third model. Subsequently, more detailed information about the course of HCU over the year was provided by performing the same analyses for time-point specific reported HCU at 3- (reflecting HCU between baseline and 3 months follow-up), 6- (reflecting HCU between 3 and 6 months follow-up), and 12 months (reflecting HCU between 9 and 12 months follow-up) after ICD implantation, respectively. All analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0. A p-value < .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Patient characteristics A total of 1024 patients were approached for participation, with 340 patients signing the informed consent. Of these 340 patients, 15% (51/340) did not return the baseline questionnaire, an additional 11% (31/289) were lost to follow-up, and 3% (9/280) passed away in the period between baseline and 12 months follow-up (see Figure 1 for a detailed description of the sample selection). A total of 201 patients was included in the current analyses. The majority of the patients were men (274/340; 80.6%), with a mean age of 58 \u00b1 10 years. Non-responders, compared to participants, were more likely to have a NYHA functional class III/IV (58.1% vs 18.9%; 2 (1, 221) = 30.88, p <.001, phi = -.39), more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (35.5% vs 14.0%; 2 (1, 262) = 12.79, p <.001, phi = -.23), and more likely to have peripheral vascular disease (12.9% vs 4.5%; 2 (1, 262) = 4.21, p = .040, phi = -.15). A detailed overview of the baseline sample characteristics is presented in Table 1.TABLE 1.

These HCU frequencies did not significantly differ across time (F (2,680) = 2.738, p = 0.065). TABLE 2. Overview of healthcare utilization over 12 months post ICD implantation. Measurement point Mean \u00b1 SD HCU Baseline 5.39 \u00b1 5.92 HCU 3 months after implantation 6.20 \u00b17.89 HCU 6 months after implantation 5.36 \u00b1 7.34 HCU 12 months after implantation 4.76 \u00b1 7.38 Predictors of total health care utilization within 12 months post implantation Assessing the predictors of total healthcare utilization within 12 months post ICD implantation, analyses showed that sociodemographic variables (Model 1) did not explain a significant part of the variance in HCU (F (3, 155) = .91, p = .437, R2 = .017). However, after adding clinical characteristics (Model 2), the regression model improved significantly (F (4, 151) = 2.02, p = .027, R2 = .068) and explained 9% of the total variance in HCU. Age ( = -.187, p = .029), NYHA class ( = .179, p = .026), and CCI ( = .176, p = .034) emerged as independent predictors of post implantation HCU. With the addition of psychological variables (Model 3), 15% of the variance in HCU was explained (F (3, 148) = 2.67, p =.010, R2 = .067), adding to the level of prediction of the model. Of all the predictors in the final model, only depression appeared to be significantly associated with total HCU ( = 0.342, p = .002). This association indicates that higher depression scores at baseline are associated with higher HCU the first year post implantation, independent of demographic, clinical, and psychological variables (see Table 3 for a detailed overview of the regression model). Healthcare utilization at 3-, 6-, and 12 months Baseline - 3 months follow up: Assessing the predictors of HCU within the first 3 months post ICD implantation revealed that sociodemographic characteristics were not associated with HCU (Model 1: F(3, 177) = 1.91, p = .130, R2 = .031). In Model 2, clinical characteristics were added to the sociodemographic characteristics and this model explained 10% of the total variance in HCU (F (4, 173) = 2.65, p = .016, R2 = .066). Younger age ( = -.220, p = .006), NYHA class III/IV ( = .188, p = .012), and secondary indication for ICD ( = .148, p = .045) were independent predictors in this model. Adding anxiety, depression, and Type D personality in Model 3 did not significantly increase the explained variance in HCU (F (3, 170) = 2.15, p = .406, R2 = .015). Younger age ( = -.226, p = .005), NYHA class III/IV ( = .163, p = .035), and secondary indication for an ICD ( = .145, p = .049) remained significant predictors of HCU. See Table 3 for a detailed overview. Three- to 6 months follow up: For healthcare utilization between 3 and 6 months post implantation, demographic variables (Model 1) did not explain a significant proportion of the variance (F (3, 184) = 1.34, p = .263, R2 = .021). When adding clinical characteristics in Model 2, the model did not explain a significant proportion of the variance (F (4, 180) = 1.96, p = .052, R2 = .049). Younger age ( = -.177, p = .024) and CCI ( = .157, p = .039) were significantly associated with HCU. Sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics combined in Model 3 accounted for a significant 15% of the variance in HCU (F (3, 177) = 3.04, p = .002, R2 = .076). In this model, younger age ( = -. 151, p = .050) and depression ( =.370, p <.001) were associated with increased HCU, independent of other demographic, clinical and psychological variables (see Table 3). Six- to 12 months follow up: Between 6 and 12 months, sociodemographic characteristics in Model 1 were not associated with HCU (F (3, 170) = .72, p = .544, R2 = .012). Addition of clinical characteristics in Model 2 did not significantly improve the level of prediction of the model (F (4, 166) = .94, p = .358, R2 = .026). When combining sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics in Model 3, a significant 12% of the variance in HCU was explained (F (3, 163) = 2.13, p = .003, R2 = .078). Depression ( = 0.355, p = 0.001) was the only variable associated with increased HCU independent of demographic, clinical, and psychological variables (see Table 3). Although the influence of depression on HCU was larger at 6- and 12-month than at 3-months, these differences failed to reach significance. 360 61HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION IN PATIENTS WITH CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATORS CHAPTER 3TABLE 3.

The results of the current study showed that HCU was the highest between baseline and 3 months post implantation and that it gradually decreased over the 12 months follow-up. Focusing on the predictors of HCU, the results showed that for total HCU in the first year post implantation only depression was a significant predictor after controlling for demographic and clinical variables. When focusing on HCU within the first 12 months post implantation, analyses showed that between baseline and 3 months post implantation, younger age, NYHA class, and secondary indication were associated with increased HCU, adjusting for baseline demographic, clinical and psychological characteristics. However, between 3 and 6 months post implantation only younger age and depression were significant predictors of HCU after controlling for other relevant variables. In addition, between 6 and 12 months only depression was significantly associated with increased HCU independent of other relevant variables. The current findings are in line with some previous studies in the general cardiac population that focused on HCU. For example, in patients with chronic stable angina, depression was an independent predictor of an increase in mean cumulative 1-year healthcare costs, with a 33% increase in patients with depression as compared to non- depressed patients.16 This increase was observed in several healthcare sectors after controlling for other healthcare expenditure costs (e.g. physician costs, outpatient care, chronic care, inpatient care, and medications).16 A possible mechanism underlying the association between depression and HCU is the association between depression and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours (e.g. smoking, reduced exercise, unhealthy diet, alcohol consumption, and sedentary lifestyle), as depression is a known barrier for lifestyle changes, which may result in poor physical health and eventually in increased HCU.17 In addition, patients with depression may experience associated somatic symptoms (e.g. headaches, sleep disturbances) for which additional care is sought. Another explanation could be that depressed cardiac patients obtain lower quality of care as compared to cardiac patients who are not depressed.18 This may lead to undertreatment of these patients resulting in more physical complaints as a consequence. Remarkably, in contrast with existing literature on the relation between anxiety and high HCU in both cardiac and non-cardiac populations,19,20 current study did not find this association. The relatively healthy recruited population could possibly explain this. Furthermore, the majority of patients in current sample received beta-blockers as part of their cardiac medication regimen.21 As beta-blockers are known for their anxiolytic properties,22 this may have further reduced anxiety levels. Speculatively, one might also reason that increased anxiety levels might lead to less medical resource seeking as part of an avoidant coping strategy. Within the ICD population specifically, appropriate and inappropriate shocks are well known predictors of HCU.23,24 Yet, in our study, only 8% of the total sample received a shock of any kind, which may explain why no association between shocks and HCU within the predictor models was found. Nevertheless, it would be valuable for future research to conduct a sub analysis in a larger sample with only ICD recipients who have received shocks, exploring the specific contribution of appropriate and inappropriate shocks to HCU. Previous studies found older age and comorbidities9 to be predictors of increased HCU. By contrast, our results showed that younger age was associated with increased HCU, while no association was found with comorbidities. Again, a possible explanation for the latter could be that the WEBCARE sample was relatively healthy. With respect to age, within the ICD population younger age has been associated with poor adjustment post implantation and increased distress.25 As discussed previously, this may lead to increase of somatic symptoms and associated HCU. The outcomes of this study stress the necessity for clinicians to be alert to signs of depression (e.g. sadness, loss of interest, withdrawing from relatives, nonadherence to treatment etc.), in particular as of 3 months post ICD implantation. Since studies show that psychological interventions like cognitive behavioural therapy are beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms in ICD patients,26 referral for psychological help in case of a suspected mood disorder is warranted. The results of the current study must be interpreted with the following limitations in mind. Healthcare utilization was assessed using the TiC -P self-report questionnaire. While this is easy and low-cost to use, it may be prone to recall bias and therefore not an entirely accurate representation of HCU. Furthermore, the TiC -P questionnaire has been designed for psychiatric populations and has not been validated for cardiac patients. Therefore, future research should use more objective sources of information to quantify HCU. In addition, HCU over 12 months may be underestimated. As the TiC-P questionnaire assesses HCU 3 months in retrospect, at month 12 the scores reflect HCU between month 9 and 12. As in the WEBCARE study no assessment took place at 9 months, we were not able to assess the level of HCU between 6 and 9 months post implant. Furthermore, as mentioned previously the WEBCARE sample was relatively higher educated and healthy as compared to other ICD samples. This might have influenced the results and their generalizability to the general ICD population. Final, given improvements in technology of the ICD during the last decade, the representativeness 364 65HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION IN PATIENTS WITH CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATORS CHAPTER 3 of the WEBCARE cohort for the current ICD population might be questionable. These innovations have led to a reduction in shocks, and could therefore have an influence on the generalizability of current findings. However, similar levels of depression have been reported by a study in ICD recipients that did use new programming strategies.27 This study also have some advantages. It is the first study to examine HCU in the ICD population, using a prospective study design in a well-described population. In addition, research shows that only a small number of high-cost utilizers in general keeps using medical resources after a year. Future studies are warranted that focus on the mechanisms underlying the association between depression and HCU. In addition, it would be valuable to examine which patient profiles are associated with increased HCU in order to develop programs that could provide more personalized care at the right time. Finally, research is warranted to replicate the current findings, using more objective indicators of HCU and associated costs and compare whether there is a discrepancy between objective and subjective indicators of HCU. In conclusion, this study showed that depression is an important predictor of HCU in ICD patients within the first 12 months post implantation. The impact of depression on HCU is particularly prominent from 3 months and up to 12 months post implantation. Within the first three months, younger age, NYHA classification (III-IV), and secondary indication showed to be associated with HCU. Future research should focus identifying patients who need additional care and provide this on time in order to better meet patients' needs and lower future healthcare utilization.

Current study examines the association between Type D personality, pessimism, and optimism and risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTa's) and mortality in patients with a first-time ICD 6 years post implantation. Methods: A total of 221 first-implant ICD patients completed questionnaires on optimism and pessimism (Life Orientation Test) and Type D personality (Type D scale DS14) 10 to 14 days after implantation. VTa's and all-cause mortality 6 years post implant comprised the study endpoints. Results: Ninety (40.7%) patients had experienced VTa's and 37 (16.7%) patients died, 12 (5.4%) due to a cardiac cause. Adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that pessimism was significantly associated with increased risk of VTa's (OR=1.09; not associated with VTa's. None of the personality types were associated with mortality. Conclusion: Pessimism was associated with VTa's but not with mortality. No significant association with either of the endpoints was observed for Type D personality and optimism. Future research should focus on the coexistent psychosocial factors that possibly lead to adverse cardiac prognosis in this patient population.INTRODUCTION Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy is the first-line treatment, both as primary (patients who are at risk to experience ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTa's)) and secondary prevention (patients who have experienced VTa's), for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to life-threatening VTa's.1 ICD therapy is associated with better survival as compared to anti-arrhythmic drugs,2 although this remains precarious for particular patient subgroups (e.g. the elderly, primary prevention).3-5 Hence, risk stratification with respect to which patients will benefit from implantation with an ICD still remains a challenge in clinical practice, warranting that we continue to strive to identify risk factors related to VTa's and mortality to further refine prognostic stratification. Besides clinical risk factors (e.g. left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)1 and shocks 6,7), a range of factors, such anxiety,8,9 depression,10 anger,11 ICD concerns,12 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),13 and impaired quality of life14 have been shown to contribute to adverse health outcomes, including survival and VTa's in the ICD population. The association between these psychological vulnerability factors and health outcomes are independent of biomedical risk factors and severity of the underlying disease.15,16 Distress is particularly manifest in patients with a Type D personality, who have the tendency to experience negative emotions (e.g. worrying) and not to share these with others.17 Some studies have found that Type D personality is associated with increased risk of mortality and VTa's12,18 in the ICD population, while other studies found no association.15,19 Furthermore, it is unclear whether the association persists over a prolonged period of time. It is observed that anxious and depressed ICD patients tend to have a more overall pessimistic view of the world that may result in adverse health outcomes.20,21 On the other hand, evidence suggests that dispositional optimism (e.g. the overall tendency to have positive expectations about future outcomes) is protective 21 and also associated with better health behaviours,22,23 better health outcomes,24 and reduced mortality risk 24 in the general cardiac population. As we do not know whether this is generalizable to the ICD population, it is important to examine whether specific personality traits make patients vulnerable or resilient for VTa's and mortality on the long-term. This might provide opportunities to optimize healthcare based on patients' preferences and needs, which in turn might lead to better clinical outcomes for specific ICD patient subgroups. Hence, the objective of the current study was to examine the association between Type D personality, pessimism, and optimism and risk of mortality and VTa's in patients with a first-time ICD 6 years post implantation. 472 73PERSONALITY TRAITS, VTA'S AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY CHAPTER 4 METHODS Patient population and procedure Consecutive patients implanted with a first-time ICD between April 2010 and February 2013 enrolled in the WEB-based distress management program for implantable CARdioverter dEfibrillator patients (WEBCARE), a multicenter randomized controlled trial, comprised the study cohort.25 Patients were recruited from six Dutch referral hospitals (Amphia Hospital, Breda; Canisius-Wilhelmina Schiedam). Patients between 18 and 75 years of age, who underwent a first-time ICD implantation were approached for participation by an ICD nurse or technician. Patients with significant cognitive impairments (e.g. dementia), history of psychiatric illness other than depressive or anxiety disorders, life expectancy less than 1 year, on the waiting list for heart transplantation, life-threatening comorbidities (e.g. malignancies), lack of internet/computer skills, or insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language were excluded. Participants were requested to complete a set of validated and standardized questionnaires in the first year post implant (i.e., at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12 months). More details on the study procedure has been described elsewhere .26 The study was conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration, and the protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethical Committees of all participating centres (METC number MEC -2009-211 / NL25617.078.09; NCT00895700). All participants were informed orally and in writing about the study and all provided written informed consent. Measurements Sociodemographic and clinical variables Purpose-designed questionnaires were used at baseline to collect information on patients' age and gender (i.e. 0 'male' and 1 'female'). Information on clinical variables was obtained from patients' medical records and included systolic dysfunction (LVEF), ICD indication (primary versus secondary), aetiology of CAD (i.e. 0 'no' and 1 'yes'), ICD shocks (i.e. 'no' and 1 'yes' and and inappropriate'). Comorbidities were assessed with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Type D personality Type D personality was assessed with the Type D scale (DS14).27 This self-report questionnaire consists of two distinct subscales comprised of 7 items each, i.e. Social Inhibition (SI) (e.g. 'I am a \"closed\" kind of person' ) and Negative Affectivity (NA) (e.g. 'I am often irritated' ). Items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (false) to 4 (true), with total scores on the scales ranging from 0 to 28. Type D is defined by a standardized cut-off score of 10 on both subscales. The questionnaire is internally consistent, with Cronbach's alpha's of 0.86 for SI and 0.88 for NA, respectively.27 Previous research has shown that Type D personality is a stable construct over time.28 Optimism and Pessimism The Life Orientation Test (LOT) was used to assess the personality traits optimism and pessimism.29 The total questionnaire consists of 12 items that are answered on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (very much disagree) to 4 (very much agree). The construct of optimism is comprised of 4 items (e.g. ' In uncertain times, I usually expect the best' ) while 4 items contribute to the construct of pessimism (e.g. ' I hardly ever expect thing to go my way' ). The remaining 4 items do not contribute to the sum score, as they represent 'filler items'. Both subscales have a total score range from 0 to 16, with a higher score reflecting a higher level of the respective traits. Study endpoints The study endpoints were all-cause mortality and VTa's 6 years post ICD implant. The follow-up time ranged from 4 to 7 years, with a mean of 5.82 \u00b1 0.81 years (IQR = 1). Not all centres were able to provide information on cause of death. Therefore, cardiac- related mortality could not been included as an endpoint separately. Information on mortality and VTa's were obtained from the patients' medical records. Based on stored electrograms and ICD data, electrophysiologists and/or the treating cardiologists judged the appropriateness of ICD therapies. Cause of death and date were derived from patients' medical record by the cardiologists associated with the recruitment centre. Statistical analysis Baseline characteristics were assessed using mean scores with standard deviations (SD) (continuous variables) and frequencies (categorical variables) for descriptive purposes. These are presented as means \u00b1 SD and percentages for the total sample. In order to handle missing data, pairwise deletion was performed. Chi-square tests and t-tests were performed in order to examine potential systematic differences between patients who were included in the analysis and patients who were excluded. Univariable and multivariable hierarchical binary logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between different personality traits (i.e., optimism, pessimism, Type D) and VTa's. Cox-Regression analysis was performed to examine the association between personality traits and all-cause mortality. A priori based on the literature, we had decided to adjust all multivariable models for demographic (gender, age) and clinical (LVEF, ICD indication, CAD aetiology, shocks, CCI) covariates. New York Heart Association 474 75PERSONALITY TRAITS, VTA'S AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY CHAPTER 4 (NYHA) functional class was not included into the models because of missing data (N = 186). Instead, we added LVEF as indication of heart disease severity.30 Shocks were excluded as a covariate in the analysis on ventricular arrhythmias. In the first model, the different personality traits were entered separately (optimism, pessimism, or Type D) for all-cause mortality and VTa's, respectively. In model 2, model 1 was adjusted for the aforementioned demographic covariates. Finally, the medical covariates were added in model 3. Assumptions for all multivariable analyses were checked and met. A p-value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 was used to perform all analyses. RESULTS Patient characteristics Of 1024 patients approached for participation, 562 were eligible for study inclusion. Of the 562 patients, 340 patients signed informed consent. Because of missing data on dependent and independent variables, 35% (n=119) of patients were excluded from analysis, leaving 221 patients in the analysis with respect to VTa's. From 3 additional patients it was not possible to establish the data of death. Hence, these patients were excluded from the all-cause mortality analysis, resulting in N=218 for those models. Patients excluded from analysis were less likely to use ACE inhibitors (p<.01), statins (p<.01), and more likely to use psychotropic medication (p =.02). No other systematic differences between included and excluded patients on baseline characteristics were found. Baseline characteristics of the current sample are presented in Table 1. The majority of patients were male (184/221; 83.3%), with a mean age of 58.95 \u00b1 9.88 years at the time of implantation. During the follow-up period, 59 (26.7%) patients received a shock (either appropriate and/or inappropriate), 90 (40.7%) had experienced VTa's, 37 (16.7%) patients died of which 12 (5.4%) patients died due to a cardiac cause. No information on the other causes of death was available. Type D personality, ventricular arrhythmias and all-cause mortality Type D personality was with VTa's (OR=1.16; 95% CI=0.54- CI=0.50-2.33; p=.85) after adding age and gender as covariates in Model 2 (2 (3, N = 221 ) = 8. 1 0, p=.04). Being female was associated with a decreased risk of VT a's (OR=0.32; 95% CI=0.14-0.75; p<.01). In Model 3, clinical covariates were as covariates (i.e., ICD indication, LVEF, CCI, CAD aetiology). The association non-significant (OR=1.05; 95% CI=0.47- 2.32; p=.91).

The association between female gender and VTa's remained significant (OR=0.35; 95% CI=0.14-0.86; p=.02). Secondary ICD indication risk of VTa's (OR=2.43; 95% CI=1.21-4.88; p=.01). No other significant associations were found (see Table 3). In unadjusted analysis, pessimism was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR=1.01; 95% CI=0.91-1.12; p=.91). After the addition of age and gender in Model 2, the association with pessimism was unchanged. The association between pessimism and mortality remained non-significant in Model 3 after adjustment for ICD indication, LVEF, shocks, history of ischemic heart disease, CCI, age, and gender. None of the covariates were associated with mortality (see Table 3). TABLE 3.

After adjustment for age and gender in model 2 (2 (3, N = 221) = 8.09, p=.04), optimism remained non-significant (OR=1.01; 95% CI=0.91-1.12; p=.88), while being female was significantly a decreased risk of VTa's (OR=0.32; 95% CI=0.14-0.75; p<.01). In model 3 (2 (7 , N = 221) = 16. 16, p=.02), after additional adjustment for ICD indication, CAD aetiology, CCI, and LVEF, the association between and VTa's did not change (OR=1.00; 95% CI=0.90-1.12; p=.98). Again, being female was of VTa's (OR=0.35; 95% CI=0.15-0.87; p=.02). Secondary ICD increased risk (OR=2.40; 95% CI=1.20-4.78; p=.01). No significant influences of other covariates were found (see Table 4). Regarding all-cause mortality, the unadjusted logistic regression analysis showed no significant association with optimism (HR=0.92; 95% CI=0.81-1.05; p=.23). In model 2, adding age and gender as covariates, the association of optimism with mortality remained unchanged. After additional adjustment for clinical covariates in Model 3, the influence of optimism remained non-significant. Other covariates were not significantly associated with all-cause mortality (see Table 4). TABLE 4.

We did not find a significant association between Type D personality and VTa's nor between Type D and mortality. The results for optimism were similar. By contrast, pessimism was associated with increased risk of VTa's after statistical adjustment for possible confounding clinical and demographic variables. No association between pessimism and all-cause mortality was observed. The lack of significant association between Type D personality and VTa's and mortality, respectively, is not in line with previous studies in ICD patients.12,18 The incongruent findings across studies on Type D and health outcomes in the ICD population may be explained by heterogeneity in follow-up duration (e.g. short-term), sample size (e.g. large sample sizes), and different statistical methods used for data analyses (e.g. survival analysis). As current study involves a long-term follow-up period of six years, the incongruity with previous findings might indicate that the predictive value of Type D personality on survival within the ICD population is hypothetically short-term. Another reason for the current negative findings could be the use of all-cause rather than cardiac-related mortality as endpoint.31,32 The association between Type D personality and mortality is believed to work through biological, disease-specific mechanistic pathways (e.g. increased pro-inflammatory cytokines) and is therefore expected to be markedly more related to cardiac mortality and morbidity.33 It was not possible for all centers to provide information on cause of death. Hence, we were not able to look at cardiac-related mortality separately. Moreover, previous research has shown that the combination of Type D personality and anxiety or concerns about ICD treatment increases the risk of mortality 12 or VTa's,34 suggesting a possible cumulative effect of co-existing emotional and personality factors and that psychosocial risk factors often cluster together to influence health outcomes.35 Therefore, future research should focus on the interplay between psychological states and underlying personality traits in order to design effective interventions that meet patients' needs in order to improve patients' outcomes. Moreover, although the general perception is that personality is stable and difficult to change,36 previous research has shown that certain interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, assertiveness training) are of beneficial value for interpersonal functioning of Type D patients 37 and may thus provide opportunities for improvement of negative outcomes within this population. In the current study, we also found that women had a decreased risk of VTa's as compared to men. Previous research has shown that electrophysiological parameters 480 81PERSONALITY TRAITS, VTA'S AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY CHAPTER 4 prone to the effect of sex hormones (i.e. oestrogen, testosterone), resulting in a difference in risk for VTa's between men and women.38 This suggests a more gender specific approach of care needed in the ICD population. With respect to current findings, future studies should look into possibilities to design interventions which aim to reduce pessimism. Evaluating whether these interventions are effective and also reduce the risk of adverse outcomes would provide a stronger evidence base and could be implemented in the clinical practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies examining the association between dispositional pessimism and adverse outcomes in ICD patients. An increased risk was found for VTa's in relation to pessimism. This finding could be explained by the interrelation between dispositional pessimism, negative emotions and sympathetic nervous system activation.39 According to Lampert,40 VT a's are linked with negative emotions by their altering effect on the autonomic nervous system. This alteration may lead to insufficient repolarisation of the myocardium and VTa's in vulnerable patients.41 W e f o u n d n o s i gn ifi ca n t a ssoc i a ti o n be tw ee n o p ti m i s m a n d VT a' s a n d mortality, respectively. Previous research in multiple cardiac populations has found that dispositional optimism may protect against negative health related outcomes, such as mortality 24 and health related quality of life.42 This is at odds with our finding, which may be attributed to the relatively small sample size of the WEBCARE cohort. Speculatively, it is also possible that optimism might only be protective on the short- but not long- term in the ICD population or that the effect of optimism on health-related outcomes might be mediated by other psychosocial factors (e.g. treatment expectations 43) not added in our analyses. Hence, future research should look into potential mediating mechanisms and duration of potential protective effect of positive psychological factors and health outcomes. Optimism and pessimism are not necessarily traits that are at opposite ends of the same continuum but may coexist,44 providing opportunities for intervention. Thus, enhancing positive psychological states on a low-threshold basis could lead to beneficial health outcomes in ICD patients.45 In order to reach their full potential, it is suggested to combine positive psychology interventions with stress reducing techniques and physical activity.46 Toise et al. 47 showed in a yoga pilot intervention that aimed to reduce distress in ICD patients a decreased risk of VTa's, less concerns about the ICD firing, and more self-compassion in the intervention group compared to the control condition. Therefore, focusing on patients' personality and needs in clinical care could be of added value in addition to interventions already offered through existent routine clinical pathways.The results of the current study should be interpreted with the following limitations in mind. First, because of lack of information on the 'time-to-event', we could not perform Cox regression analyses. Second, medical records frequently did not provide information on the cause of death of patients, which resulted in ambiguity with respect to cause of death (i.e., all-cause versus cardiac), which may have influenced the results. Third, the relatively small sample size has limited the number of covariates that we could include in the statistical analyses. Hence, possibly important covariates such as psychiatric illness or medication use were not included in the models. Finally, patients who were excluded from the analysis were more likely to use psychotropic medication, this might have resulted in an underrepresentation of this group in the current sample. A large scale study covering a more representative sample is advocated in the future. Despite these limitations, this study is one of only few studies that have looked at the association between psychosocial factors in relation to mortality and VTa's in ICD patients with a long-term follow-up. In conclusion, the findings of the current study have shown no effect of Type D personality and dispositional optimism on VTa's and mortality in ICD patients. However, an association between pessimism and VTa's was distinguished. Further, sufficiently powered studies, applying more robust statistical methods (e.g. survival analysis) are warranted to confirm our finding that pessimism is related to VTa's in ICD patients, with respect to optimizing risk stratification. Future research should also focus on the coexistent psychosocial factors that possibly lead to worse adverse cardiac prognosis in this patient population (such as psychiatric disorders, low socioeconomic status). Insight into these factors could lead to interventions that meet patients' needs to a bigger extent and favour the inhibition of disease progression.

Objectives: Current trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Do Cardiac Health: Advanced New Generation Ecosystem (Do CHANGE) service, which is developed to assist cardiac patients in adopting a healthy lifestyle and improving their quality of life. Methods: Cardiac patients (i.e., people who have been diagnosed with heart failure, coronary artery disease, and/or hypertension) will be recruited at three pilot sites (Badalona Serveis Assistencials, Badalona, Spain [N=75]; Buddhist Taiwan [N=100] and Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital, Tilburg, The Netherlands [N=75]). Patients will be assisted by the Do Something Different (DSD) program to change their unhealthy habits and/or lifestyle. DSD has been developed to increase behavioral flexibility and subsequently adopt new (healthier) habits. In addition, patients' progress will be monitored with a number of (newly developed) devices (e.g., Fitbit, Beddit, COOKiT, FLUiT) which will be integrated in one application. Results: The Do CHANGE trial will provide us with new insights regarding the effectiveness of the proposed intervention in different cultural settings. In addition, it will give insight in what works for whom and why. Conclusions: The Do CHANGE service integrates new technologies with a behavior change intervention in order to change unhealthy lifestyle of cardiac patients. The program is expected to facilitate long-term, sustainable behavior change.INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and a major driver of health care costs.1 Evidence shows that a large proportion of the disease burden can be explained by behavioral factors (e.g. low physical activity, unhealthy diet),2 and that approximately 80% of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes type 2 could be prevented by attenuating or eliminating these health risk behaviors.3,4 Hence, in their recent call for action, the American Heart Association has stressed the importance of lifestyle management and has called for better lifestyle counseling and the development of interventions to support health behavior change in cardiac patients.5 Despite evidence showing that changing health behaviors improves (mental) health outcomes and lowers health care costs,5 to date, lifestyle counseling is not routinely implemented in physicians' office.6 More precisely, physicians provide this type of counseling in only 34% of the clinic visits.7 One of the important reasons for this is possibly the fact that face-to-face counseling is time-consuming. Remote technologies offer a new delivery model for promoting healthy behaviors and are increasingly used in health care settings.8 Although these new developments provide an excellent opportunity to deliver behavior change interventions to large groups of under-served patients, the reported effect sizes have been small.8 Possible explanations for this are the short duration of the interventions,8 the limited number of health-related behaviors addressed within the intervention program,9 the mismatch between patients' needs or preferences and the intervention, or the lack of sound behavior change methods adopted.10 Previous trials within the cardiac population have demonstrated that a 'one size fits all' approach does not seems to work11 \u2014 revealing the importance of personalizing the care plan and addressing patients' needs and preferences. Evidence shows that the conventional way of providing education about a healthy lifestyle does not result in adopting desirable health behaviors.12 In order to produce sustainable change in health behaviors, the Do CHANGE study will provide a personalized theory-based behavior intervention program for three months, addressing multiple health behaviors at the same time, creating awareness of unhealthy behaviors, and changing unhealthy habits.13 Do CHANGE service aims to address cardiac patients' unhealthy habits and change these by providing them with monitoring tools (e.g. Fitbit) and increasing their behavioral flexibility. The Do Something Different behavior change program will be provided, which aims to disrupt the habit chains that are common in our daily living. As people generally tend to live in accordance with their habits,14 disrupting these habits may lead to higher behavioral flexibility and eventually to behavior change.13 The Do Something Different program has shown to be effective in changing health behaviors in previous studies targeting different populations.15 The Do 592 93LIFESTYLE CHANGE IN CARDIAC PATIENTS THROUGH THE DO CHANGE SYSTEM CHAPTER 5 CHANGE service will, thus, not only provide patients with innovative tools to support behavior change, but will also offer behavioral alternatives and carefully assess patients' needs on using these innovative tools. The objective of the current trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of the personalized Do CHANGE service in changing unhealthy lifestyle and improve the quality of life in cardiac patients. The Do CHANGE service will be developed and evaluated in three different countries (Spain, Taiwan, The Netherlands), implying a representation of patients from different cultural backgrounds. This may contribute to a higher generalizability of the study findings. METHODS Design Do CHANGE is an international (Spain, Taiwan, The Netherlands), multicenter, randomized (intervention versus care as usual) controlled trial designed to support lifestyle change in patients with cardiac disease. By increasing patients' behavioral flexibility and providing them with innovative devices, the objectives of enhancing lifestyle change and improving patients' quality of life are expected to be reached. The evaluation of the Do CHANGE service delivery consists of two randomized controlled trials: 1) Do CHANGE which has been registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02946281) and which has provided input for the further development and improvement of the 2) currently described trial 'Do CHANGE - 2' (NCT03178305). Study population Patients primarily diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) (having experienced a myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, angina pectoris and/or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), symptomatic heart failure (HF) (New York Heart Association class I-IV), and patients diagnosed with hypertension (HT) will be included in the study. Hypertension is defined by values 140 mmHg of systolic blood pressure (SBP) or 90 mmHg of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in two different measurements spaced 1-2 minutes apart and after 3-5 minutes in the sitting position. The values associated with the second measure will be used. Inclusion criteria: age 18-75 years, diagnosed (primary diagnosis) with CAD, HF or HT, having at least two of the following risk factors: smoking, positive family history, increased cholesterol, diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, and/or psychosocial risk factors. Patients should also have access to the Internet at home and have a smartphone which is compatible with the applications that will be used in the study (and have sufficient knowledge on using personal computer and smartphone), and speak the countries' native language. Additional inclusion criteria for HF patients only are to have a diagnosis of systolic or diastolic heart failure and experience HF symptoms (e.g. shortness of breath, chest pain, and exhaustion). Exclusion criteria: significant cognitive impairments (e.g. dementia), patients who are on the waiting list for heart transplantation, life expectancy <1 year, life-threatening comorbidities (e.g. cancers), with a history of psychiatric illness other than anxiety/ depression, patients who do not have access to Internet, not having a compatible smartphone, and patients with insufficient knowledge of the local language (Catalonian, Chinese or Dutch). Patients who have participated in the first phase Do CHANGE trial will also be excluded. Sample size A total number of 250 patients will be enrolled in the study at three participating centers (Badalona Serveis Assistencials, Badalona, Spain (N=75); Buddhist Taiwan (N=100) and Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital, Tilburg, The Netherlands (N=75)). The sample sizes were determined based on the number of patients visiting the outpatient clinic per center. One hundred and twenty- five patients will be enrolled in the intervention group and 125 in the control group. Considering participation rates in the previously performed Do CHANGE trial and other randomized controlled trials, we expect a significant number (50%) of patients to refuse participation. Hence, we will need to approach 500 patients to include 250. As current trial aims to provide a proof of concept, sample size calculation will not be performed. A total of 250 patients is considered sufficient to meet this purpose. Randomization Patients will be randomized (2:2) to either the intervention group or the control group (usual care). Patients will be randomized using computerized block randomization (stacks of 4). The computer will generate randomization sequences which will be sealed by an independent researcher. Due to the nature of the study, blinding of the researchers and healthcare providers is not possible. Study procedure Patients who fulfill all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be approached for participation. Due to differences in the healthcare organization 594 95LIFESTYLE CHANGE IN CARDIAC PATIENTS THROUGH THE DO CHANGE SYSTEM CHAPTER 5 between the three participating countries, the logistics of patient recruitment per site might slightly differ. Overall procedure The health care professional (cardiologist or cardiac nurse) will inform the patient about the study (orally and in writing). Patients who are willing to participate will be provided with an informed consent and will be given ten days to consider their participation. The research assistant will contact the patients by telephone and schedule a face-to-face appointment if they are willing to participate. During the face-to-face meeting, patients will sign the informed consent (together with the researcher) and will fill in the first set of questionnaires (as shown in Table 1 ).

Patients randomized to the intervention group will be provided with the tools (as described under the heading 'Intervention') and instructions about the usage of these tools. Relevant tools/ applications will be installed on patients' mobile phone by the research assistant such that the patients will only have to charge the devices. One day after the face-to-face meeting, patients will be contacted by the research assistant by telephone to ensure that all devices are properly charged and that the system is up and running. The full intervention (as described below) will be provided for three months. During this period patients will be contacted weekly by the research assistant to evaluate their progress (whether they are compliant or not with the treatment as planned and will receive feedback about progress). After the three months period, the behavior change component (Do Something Different program) will be terminated. Hence, between month 3 and 6, patients in the intervention group will only be using the devices that were provided to them at baseline. In addition, to decrease patient burden, some of the tools/components will be introduced two months post-baseline measurement (see Figure 1 for a schematic overview of the study procedure). FIGURE 1: Study procedure Patients will be instructed to fill in the first set of questionnaires during their face-to- face visit at the hospital. At 3 and 6 months, the patients will receive a link (by e-mail) to access the follow-up questionnaires online with the instruction to fill them in within ten working days. If they do not complete the questionnaires within the given time, patients will receive up to three reminder phone calls. Patients who have been randomized to the intervention group will also be contacted between month 3 and 6 to participate in a qualitative survey (if possible with their partner), which will assess additional properties of the usability and acceptability of the tools. 596 97LIFESTYLE CHANGE IN CARDIAC PATIENTS THROUGH THE DO CHANGE SYSTEM CHAPTER 5 Study Objectives Primary, secondary and exploratory objectives will be assessed as described below. Primary objectives Primary objectives of the trial include 1) lifestyle (e.g. sleep, physical activity, nutrition) change and disease management, 2) enhancement of quality of life, and 3) change in behavioral habits and personal flexibility. The assessment of these objectives will be performed using standardized and validated questionnaires ( Table 1 ). In addition, purpose designed questionnaires will be administered (to evaluate changes in objective #3). Furthermore, objective measures (data from devices used by the intervention group) will be employed to evaluate changes in lifestyle variables. However, this will be done only within the intervention group as the 'care as usual' group will not receive any devices. Secondary objectives Secondary objectives will include 1) assessment of satisfaction, usability, and acceptance of the intervention (tools), 2) evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the intervention, and 3) evaluation of changes in health care consumption. Objective #1 will become real through validated questionnaires and qualitative interviews with end users and their caregivers (if applicable) while objective #2 and #3 will be evaluated using standardized and validated questionnaires only ( Table 1 ). Exploratory Current trial will also cover a number of exploratory objectives where the focus will be on 1) identifying subgroups of patients who might benefit the most from this intervention based on their profile (e.g. psychological and/or disease profile), 2) explorative evaluating the effects of the intervention on the ECG data, and 3) gaining more insight in patients sleep patterns and physical activity over a prolonged period of time. These objectives will mainly serve the development of new hypothesis regarding successful lifestyle change and will be tested using latent class analysis (LatentGold 5.0). Intervention versus Care as Usual Intervention The Do CHANGE intervention consists of different components which can be used to provide care that meets patients' needs. All patients included in the intervention group will be provided with the following technology; CarePortal, Moves app, Do Something Different (behavioral program), Beddit\u00a9, Fitbit\u00a9, blood pressure monitor, COOKiT, and Vire (the Do CHANGE app). In addition, disease-specific tools will only be provided to those who need them (weight scale and/or FLUiT). Based on patients' primary diagnosis (HF, CAD, or HT) the tools that might be useful will be recommended by the cardiologist. For example, patients with HF will receive a weight scale, as this can assist them in monitoring sudden weigh gain as this might be an indication of worsening of cardiac function. Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of the intervention components. To decrease patient burden, the COOKiT and FLUiT will be introduced to patients two months post-baseline measurement. FIGURE 2: Schematic overview of the Do CHANGE intervention components Do Something Different All patients randomized to the intervention group will receive the Do Something Different program, which has previously been developed to change behavioral habits and flexibility.13 For the current trial, the program has been adapted to cardiac patients' needs and profiles to meet the lifestyle recommendations of this specific population. The program challenges patients to step out of their comfort zone by sending behavioral prompts (Do's) such as \" Explore More Day. Today instead of going the same old way, take a different route. Look around, spot ten things you wouldn't see on your usual journey \". By breaking the old unhealthy habits, patients are expected to be more flexible and able to change their behavior. The program aims to change behavioral habits and increase flexibility and subsequently change habits associated with an unhealthy lifestyle and distress, which are both found to be associated with hypertension and cardiovascular 598 99LIFESTYLE CHANGE IN CARDIAC PATIENTS THROUGH THE DO CHANGE SYSTEM CHAPTER 5 risks. 'Typical' behavioral risks have been identified and are addressed within the program. To further adapt the program to patients' needs, all patients, prior to starting the program, will be assessed regarding their daily functioning, distress, and personality such that the Do's will match their personal (unhealthy) habits and challenge them to change. After assessing patients' personality profile, the intervention will be provided for 1 1 weeks. Patients will receive a total of 32 Do's / messages during this period. Also, 16 ToDo's will be delivered to the patients based on their current functioning (e.g. if a patient is not performing sufficient exercise, based on the Fitbit data, he/she will receive a Do based on that). Patients will receive their Do's and ToDo's trough the care portal, Do CHANGE app and via SMS, depending on patients' preferences. The intervention group will also receive some devices which will help them to monitor their health behaviors and give them some insight into their daily functioning. These devices will include: CarePortal The intervention group will also receive a CarePortal (Docobo Ltd.) which will be installed at their home. The CarePortal is a clinically certified portable device that will allow the patients to monitor their disease symptoms on a daily basis (by answering a set of predefined questions every day) and send these to the health care professional (cardiologist). The CarePortal will be used to gather ECG data, symptomatic data, blood pressure, and weight on a daily basis. The patient will be able to take the ECG measure at any time. By touching the screen of the CarePortal, the instructions to take the measurement will appear, guiding the patient step by step to take the ECG (which all will take 2 minutes). The CarePortal will send the (physiological) data directly to the cardiologist who will be able to access those via an online platform and contact the patient if necessary. Also, the patients will see their data (the same as their cardiologist will receive) over a period of six months by accessing the online patient portal. Beddit\u00a9 To objectively log patients' sleep data and evaluate whether their sleep pattern has changed over time patients assigned to the intervention group will all receive the Beddit device.24 Beddit is a certified device to measure sleep, heart rate, and breathing during time spent in bed. The device has been validated25 and is considered one of the most accurate devices to monitor sleep. For the current trial the \"Beddit 3\" will be used. This thin device is hidden under patients their cover sheet.Fitbit\u00a9 Patients' physical activity will be assessed using the Fitbit 'Alta HR'.26 Altra HR is CE- marked and can be worn on the wrist. With the Fitbit patients' step count, the intensity of physical activity, heart rate, calories burned and distanced walked will be assessed. Data from the Fitbit will also be used to initiate ToDo's. Blood pressure monitor All patients in the intervention group will receive the digital blood pressure monitor 'UA -767 Plus', which is a CE-marked medical device. Patients will be asked to measure their blood pressure on a daily basis and log the blood pressure values through the CarePortal. COOKiT COOKiT is a smart spatula that can monitor patients' cooking behavior (through a motion sensor which indicates whether the spatula is used) and measure the salinity\u2014 for both sodium and potassium\u2014of the food that is prepared. The COOKiT has been developed within Do CHANGE and will be provided to patients two months post- baseline measurement. Vire (Do CHANGE app) In order for patients not to feel overwhelmed by the apps and devices that they will have to check every day (if they are interested in their progress), the Vire app (Do CHANGE app) has been developed as the integration point. Vire app has been developed together with end users and healthcare professionals. This app provides an overview of the data gathered by all the devices that the patients will be using during the study (e.g. Beddit, Fitbit, COOKiT, etc.). Through this application, patients will also be able to receive the Do's from the Do Something Different program. Besides, patients will be asked to take pictures (at least three per day) of the food which they have consumed each day (via this app). These images will automatically be sent to the healthcare professional portal (which is also linked to the CarePortal) such that the healthcare professional will be able to see what the eating habits of the patients are. Moves app Moves app is an activity and GPS tracking application installed on the mobile phone. The app helps to provide information useful for assessing the behavioral indicators\u2014social opportunity, variety, and activity\u2014used for generating ToDo's. All patients participating in the intervention will have to install the Moves app on their mobile phone. 5100 101LIFESTYLE CHANGE IN CARDIAC PATIENTS THROUGH THE DO CHANGE SYSTEM CHAPTER 5 Additional devices Dependent on the primary diagnosis, the patient will decide together with the healthcare professional which of the additional devices the patient will be using: FLUiT Particularly for patients with HF the FLUiT will be recommended. FLUiT is a newly developed device in Do CHANGE which can measure fluid intake. FLUiT is a 'smart sleeve' which can be wrapped around a cup/bottle/glass and will gauge the amount of fluid that it contains. It comprises an accelerometer and a touch sensor to detect when actual drinking occurs and will log the quantity drank. FLUiT will be provided to patients two months post baseline measures. Weight scale Patients with HF will be provided with a weight scale to monitor their weight on a daily basis. For the current trial, the 'Seca Aura 807' model will be used. Patients will be able to communicate their weight on a daily basis by answering the question on the CarePortal. Patients will all be monitored weekly via telephone to make sure that they are compliant with the program. During these phone calls, patients will also receive feedback on their eating habits. Care as Usual Patients who are randomized to the comparator group will receive care as usual. There will be no restrictions on this group. Patients in this condition are allowed to seek additional care and also use other tools, which will enhance their disease/well-being, provided that they report this in the purpose designed questionnaires at follow-up. Statistical analyses Data will be analyzed using SPSS (IBM statistics 22) and LatentGold (Version 5.0) statistical package. Continuous and discrete variables will be compared using respectively Students' T-test and Chi2 test. The Linear Mixed Models (LMM) procedure will be performed to evaluate the treatment effectiveness over time. The LMM procedure is similar to linear regression analyses except that in LMM the dependent variable is measured at multiple time points. These analyses will be adjusted for baseline distress levels. If the interaction effects are not significant, the main effects only will be entered in the final model. To examine which patients might benefit from the intervention based on their profiles Latent Class Analyses will be performed. 27,28 An alpha of .05 will be used to indicate level of significance.RESULTS The acquisition of data of the trial described in this paper is expected to be finished in the summer of 2018. The following data analysis and additional publications are expected to be accomplished in the winter of 2018 and spring 2019. DISCUSSION Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, and they pose a significant burden on current health care systems.1,29 Studies have shown that behavioral factors (e.g. physical inactivity, unhealthy diet) account for a large proportion of the disease burden and thus should be addressed (potentially) by health care providers.2 The Do CHANGE trial aims to address lifestyle behaviors and increase the quality of life of patients with CAD, HF, and HT. By increasing patients' behavioral flexibility and providing them with supportive devices, patients are expected to break with their unhealthy habits and change their unhealthy lifestyle in a sustainable manner. According to Pine & Fletcher13 there are multiple reasons why current behavioral programs have not been successful in changing health behaviors. Firstly, our behavior is only partly guided by willpower, hence, most patients fail to use willpower to prevent habitual behaviors ( e.g. smoking). Secondly , behavior is often guided by everyday environmental cues which trigger certain response (e.g. having a beer triggers smoking). Finally, there is a knowledge-doing gap which is demonstrated by the fact that we often know what is good for our health but we fail to do it.12,13 People tend to live by their habits, which can be stable over time, and seem not to be able to act in accordance with their knowledge. Hence, within Do CHANGE we tend to increase awareness and knowledge about unhealthy behaviors and at the same time, by using the Do Something Different technique, disrupt habit chains in daily living. This is expected to boost behavioral flexibility and enhance behavior change.15 A total of 250 patients will be recruited from three pilot sites (Spain, The Netherlands, and Taiwan) and will be randomized to either the intervention group or care as usual. Patients in the intervention group will receive the Do Something Different program (for three months) and will be using devices that will assist them in behavior change (for six months). Patients will be assessed at baseline, by the third and sixth months. Current trial might face some challenges due to 1) the international scope and 2) the number of devices that are given to patients. As patient recruitment will take place in Spain, The Netherlands, and Taiwan cultural differences might affect the outcomes of the trial. Also, due to logistical differences between the pilot sites, patient recruitment will be slightly different per site. Although we do not expect this to have a significant 5102 103LIFESTYLE CHANGE IN CARDIAC PATIENTS THROUGH THE DO CHANGE SYSTEM CHAPTER 5 impact on the results, we do consider it as a challenge. Secondly, some patients will receive multiple devices/applications which they are expected to use for six months. This might be perceived as overwhelming and may potentially lead to lower adherence. However, current trial implements a behavior change component to the intervention, which aims to increase personal flexibility and enables behavior change. This might lead to more openness for new behaviors (using devices) and thus improve adherence. Do CHANGE will provide insights into lifestyle changes and the possible mechanism that might drive this change (personal flexibility). In addition, it will give valuable information from objective measures about patients' behavioral patterns which, in turn, could serve as input for future studies that will focus on personalized medicine. This information will also provide input for the development of future ecological momentary interventions that are focused on providing care to patients whenever and wherever they prefer it.

Broers J. Widdershoven Ayoola J. Piera-Jimenez M. Habibovi on behalf of the Do CHANGE consortium Accepted for publicaton6108 109RESULTS AND FEASIBILITY OF THE DO CHANGE 1 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CHAPTER 6 ABSTRACT Background: Behavior change methods involving new ambulatory technologies may improve lifestyle and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Objective: The current study provides proof of concept analyses of an intervention aiming to increase 1) behavioral flexibility, 2) lifestyle change, and 3) quality of life. The feasibility and patient acceptance of the intervention was also evaluated. Methods: Patients with cardiovascular disease (N=149, age=63.57\u00b18.30 years; 33.6% women) were recruited in the 'Do Cardiac Health Advanced New Generated Ecosystem (Do CHANGE)' trial, and randomized to the 'Do CHANGE' intervention or care as usual' (CAU). The intervention involved a 3-months behavioral program in combination with ecological momentary assessment and intervention technologies. Results: The intervention was experienced as feasible and useful. A significant increase in lifestyle scores over time was found for both groups (F (2,146.6) =9.99, p<.001), which was similar for CAU and the intervention group (F (1,149.9) =.09, p=.77). Quality of life improved more in the intervention group (1.11\u00b10.11) than CAU (-1.47\u00b1.11) immediately following intervention (3-months), but this benefit was not sustained at the 6-months follow-up ( p interaction =.02) No significant treatment effects were observed for behavioral flexibility (F (1,149.0) =.48, p=.07). Conclusion: The Do CHANGE 1 intervention was perceived as useful and easy to use. However, no long-term treatment effects were found on the outcome measures. More research is warranted to examine which components of behavioral interventions are effective in producing long-term behavior change.INTRODUCTION Elimination of modifiable behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity) in the general population could prevent 80% of adverse clinical outcomes.1 In patients with diagnosed cardiovascular disease, a modest reduction in risk behaviors can decrease the mortality rates by approximately 50%.2 However, recommended targets (e.g., lifestyle and medication adherence) for secondary prevention are rarely reached.3 To achieve sustained health behavior change, active interventions that go beyond patient education are needed.4 Sustainable behavior changes can be enhanced by implementing a personalized patient-tailored approach.5,6 New ambulatory technologies can now be used to provide personalized support in a low threshold, non-obtrusive and ecologically valid manner. These devices can be used to provide feedback about ambulatory health behaviors (e.g., physical activity levels), but they are not sufficient to produce long-term behavior change.7,8 In the setting of cardiac rehabilitation, telemonitoring guidance for patients' physical activity levels was found to be feasible in the FIT@Home study, and this intervention resulted in higher patient satisfaction and trends towards lower health care costs, but not in better improvements in fitness or physical activity levels relative to standard center-based rehabilitation.8 The impact of this intervention could potentially have been further improved if a more patient-tailored approach were added. Another study found initial support that an App using persuasive design techniques can improve biological and psychological factors in patients after cardiac rehabilitation.9 It is therefore plausible that ambulatory assessments are likely to have better therapeutic effects when combined with prompts that promote health-related behaviors (i.e., ecological momentary interventions). These new methodologies also require a deeper knowledge about patients' needs and preferences.10 The current trial (Do CHANGE) was specifically designed to examine this multidisciplinary approach to behavior change.11 Unique to this trial is that patients received the behavior change program \"Do Something Different\" (DSD), which has been previously developed to change unhealthy habits through the increase of behavioral flexibility.11 Behavioral flexibility is associated with a broad range of the behavioral repertoire, making people more open to experience and the adoption of new behaviors.12 DSD has been evaluated in other patient samples and has shown promising results by producing health behavior change.13 For the current study, the program was adapted to meet the needs of patients with cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease, heart failure, and hypertension). Hence, the aim of the current study is to provide proof of concept for the behavioral intervention aiming to address 1) behavioral flexibility, 2) lifestyle change, and 3) quality of life. The feasibility and patient acceptance of the intervention was also evaluated. 6110 111RESULTS AND FEASIBILITY OF THE DO CHANGE 1 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CHAPTER 6 METHODS Design The 'Do Cardiac Health Advanced New Generated Ecosystem (Do CHANGE)' trial is an international (the Netherlands and Spain), multicenter, randomized controlled trial, designed to enhance lifestyle changes in patients with cardiac disease (NCT02946281). The trial findings described in this article are the first (proof of concept and feasibility) phase of the Do CHANGE project (phase 1) and will serve as input for the further development of the enhanced Do CHANGE phase of this randomized controlled trial (Do CHANGE, phase 2) (NCT03178305). A detailed description of both phases of the Do CHANGE trial has been published previously.11 As the current trial was developed to provide information about proof of concept and feasibility, an a priori sample size calculation was not performed for this phase of the project. For this phase, we aimed to include 150 patients across two countries, which is sufficient to give information about proof of concept and feasibility of the intervention. Study sample Patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) (having experienced a myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, angina pectoris, and/or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), symptomatic heart failure (HF) (New York Heart Association class I-IV), and patients diagnosed with hypertension (HT) were included in the study. HT was defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg on two different measurements spaced 1-2 minutes apart and after 3-5 minutes in a sitting position. Values of the second measure were used. HF patients were included if they had a diagnosis of systolic or diastolic HF and the presence of HF symptoms. Patients were recruited at Badalona Serveis Assistencials (Badalona, Spain) and Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital (Tilburg, The Netherlands). The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committees of the participating hospitals and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. Inclusion criteria: 1) a primary diagnosis of CAD, HF, or HT, 2) age 18-75 years, 3) having 2 of the following risk factors: positive family history, increased cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, and/or psychosocial risk factors, 4) sufficient knowledge of the country's native language, 5) access to the Internet at home, and 6) have a smartphone compatible with the applications used in the study. Exclusion criteria: 1 ) lif e expectancy < 1 ye ar , 2 ) lif e-thr e at ening c omorbidities ( e .g. malignancy), 3) history of psychiatric illness other than anxiety and/or depression, 4) significant cognitive impairments (e.g. dementia), and 5) on the waiting list for heart transplantation. Procedure Patients meeting inclusion criteria were approached for participation by the cardiologist or cardiac nurse. If interested, patients received information about the study in writing and orally. After ten days patients were contacted to inquire about their participation. If the patient indicated that they wanted to participate, a face-to-face appointment was scheduled at the hospital. Patients were asked to sign the informed consent document and were provided with the first set of questionnaires (baseline). After filling in the questionnaires, patients were randomized. Patients in the intervention group received information about the intervention and the use of associated devices (see description under heading 'intervention'). The next day, patients in the intervention group were contacted by telephone to check that the devices were installed correctly and that the system was functional. Patients received the intervention for three months. Follow-up questionnaires were sent at three and six months. Patients returned the devices after completion of the intervention (i.e., after three months). Randomization and blinding Patients were randomized after completing the baseline questionnaires on a 1:1 basis. Randomization sequences were computer generated and individually sealed before recruitment started. After completing the questionnaires, one sealed envelope was drawn by the research assistant containing the group allocation. Because of the nature of the behavioral monitoring aspects of the study, blinding health care providers or participants to the treatment condition was not possible, whereas the initial analyses of the study outcomes was analyzed without knowledge of the treatment allocation. Intervention Do CHANGE intervention vs. Care as Usual Behavior change technique . Patients randomized to the intervention group received a three months behavior change program 'Do Something Different' (DSD), which was provided via text messages on patients' mobile phones. The DSD program that was used aims to change unhealthy habits through the increase of behavioral flexibility.11 This is achieved by disrupting patients' daily behavioral routine for a short period (few seconds) with behavioral prompts which are referred to as 'Do's' (example: \"EXPLORE MORE DAY. Today instead of going the same old way, take a different route. Look around, spot 10 things you wouldn't see on your usual journey\" ) and are provided through patients' 6112 113RESULTS AND FEASIBILITY OF THE DO CHANGE 1 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CHAPTER 6 mobile phones. These messages challenge patients to do something different and get out of their comfort zone. They have been developed by a multidisciplinary team including cardiologists and psychologists in order to make sure that the Do's apply to the patient population and are thus related to their daily behaviors / needs. Patients received a total of 32 Do's during the 3 months intervention period (2-3 Do's every week). DSD has been evaluated in other patient samples and has shown promising results with respect to behavior change.13 For the current trial, the program was adapted to the cardiac population with slight differences in the program depending on patients' primary diagnosis (CAD, HF, HT), as the preferred health behaviors may vary depending on the diagnosis. For example, because of disease-specific symptoms, advice regarding fluid intake was taken into account within the program only for patients with HF. More details regarding the DSD program are provided in the published design paper of this project.11 Technological tools . In addition to the DSD program, to obtain objective measures on patients physical functioning, all patients received a blood pressure monitor, the Moves app (to register GPS location), and the Careportal (e.g., home monitoring device measuring daily symptoms and ECG). Because of disease-specific reasons, patients diagnosed with HF also received a weight scale as daily weight monitoring is of importance in this subgroup. Data obtained from these devices will not be included in the current analysis. This manuscript will focus on the primary outcome measures related to lifestyle parameters and patient-reported outcomes which were derived from validated questionnaires (see 11 for a description of primary and secondary outcomes). Control group . Patients randomized to the 'care as usual' group received the treatment as usual and were only provided with the validated questionnaires at baseline, three and six months. These patients did not receive devices for ambulatory monitoring measures. Measures Questionnaires Primary outcomes Behavioral Flexibility: Behavioral flexibility was measured using the Do Something Different (DSD) questionnaire from scale items designed for purposes of this study.11 This scale contains 30 different descriptions of behavior coupled in 15 pairs of opposites (see Figure 1). Patients were asked at each measurement point to select the behaviours that best describe them, for example, 'gentle' or 'firm'. Based on a formula, the behavioural flexibility for each participant at each time point was calculated as outlined below: Every addition of behaviour raises the score, as well as when both of a pair of opposite behaviours are added. For example, definite, systematic, trusting, predictable, and unpredictable are selected. All these selected behaviours raise the flexibility score. However, because predictable and unpredictable are each other's opposites, these are added to the formula again and increase the flexibility score even more. The model interprets this seemingly contradictory behaviour as evidence of flexibility: based on what a given situation demands, the person can use different reactions and thus be more flexible. The total score can range from 0 to 100. The internal consistency in current sample is considered acceptable (Cronbach's = 0.67 to 0.76). Pair of opposite 1 1. Firm 2. Gentle Pair of opposite 2 3.

Lifestyle: The Health Promotion Lifestyle Profile (HPLP-II) questionnaire was administered to assess health-promoting lifestyle habits.14 This survey evaluates whether the subjective perception of patients regarding their lifestyle is changed, and consists of 52 items. (e.g., \"Eat 6-11 servings of bread, cereal, rice, and pasta each day\") in total. Each item can be answered on a 4-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (routinely). The total score can, therefore, range from 52 to 208, with a higher score indicating a 6114 115RESULTS AND FEASIBILITY OF THE DO CHANGE 1 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CHAPTER 6 better lifestyle. Furthermore, the questionnaire includes six different subscales that each cover a health promotion lifestyle domain (Physical Activity, Spiritual Growth, Health Responsibility, Interpersonal Relationships, Nutrition, and Stress Management). The internal consistency is considered as excellent in the current sample (Cronbach's = 0.88 to 0.90). Quality of Life: To administer changes in quality of life, participants completed the World Health Organization Quality of Life - BREF (WHOQOL-BREF).15 The WHOQOL-BREF is considered a reliable generic multi-dimensional quality of life measure and consists of 26 items in total. Two items refer to the facets Overall Quality of Life and General Health, whereas the abiding 24 items reflect four different domains (Physical Health, Psychological Health, Social Relationships, and Environment).The internal consistency in the current sample is excellent (Cronbach's = 0.89 to 0.90). Perceived usefulness and acceptance: The Unified Theory of Acceptance (UTAUT2) scale 16 was administered to assess the perceived usefulness and acceptance of the tools that were used in the intervention. Mean scores on 8 subscales are provided, namely: 1 ) Performance expectancy, 2) Effort expectancy, 3) Social influence, 4) Facilitating conditions, 5) Hedonic motivation, 6) Habit, 7) Behavioral intention. The initial subscale 'Price value ' of the UTAUT2 is not included, as the cost per individual for the intervention could not be estimated. The total score per subscale can range from 4 to 20, with a higher score indicating higher usefulness and acceptance. 16 The internal consistency in the current sample is excellent (Cronbach's = 0.89). Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8): To assess the satisfaction of the patients about the ecosystem, The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) 17 was used. This self-administered questionnaire is a general scale that consists of 8 Likert scale items (e.g. \"To what extent has our program met your needs?\") ranging from 0 to 4, with response descriptors that vary. The overall score can range from 8 to 32, with a higher score indicating a higher satisfaction. The internal consistency is rated as excellent (Cronbach's = 0.92).17 Other questionnaires included in the model Type D scale (DS14): Type D personality was assessed by using the Type D scale (DS-14) .18 This 14-item questionnaire consists of two subscales with seven 5-point Likert scale items each, ranging from 0 (false) to 4 (true). Total scores on both subscales range from 0 to 28. The two subscales represent the characteristics of negative affectivity (NA) (e.g., the tendency to experience negative emotions across time and situations) and social inhibition (SI) (e.g., the tendency not to express feelings). When scoring 10 on both subscales, patients were classified as Type D. With reported Cronbach's of 0.86 and 0.88 respectively the internal consistency of SI and NA are considered as satisfactory.18The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale : In order to gauge self-administered symptoms of anxiety, GAD-7 scale was conducted.19 The questionnaire is comprised of 7 items (e.g. \"Feeling afraid as if something terrible might happen\") that can be answered on a 4-point Likert-scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (almost every day). To get an indication of anxiety symptom severity, the total score (range from 0 to 21) can be used. A higher score implies higher levels of anxiety. With a Cronbach's of 0.92, the internal consistency is considered excellent.19 Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) : Depressive symptoms were administered at each time point by using the PHQ-9.20 This self-report questionnaire consists of 9 items in total (e.g. \"Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\"), each evaluated on a 4-point Likert- scale (i.e., not at all, several days, nearly every day). The total score ranges from 0 to 27, with a higher score as an indication of worse depression symptom severity. The internal consistency is considered excellent (Cronbach's = 0.90).21 Demographic and clinical data Demographic (e.g. age, sex, marital status, working status, level of education, and smoking behavior) were obtained by patients' self-report. Clinical data (e.g., comorbidities, prescribed cardiac medication, prescribed psychotropic medication, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and resting heart rate, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure measured at the most recent outpatient visit) were obtained from the medical record. Statistical analyses Categorical variables were compared using Chi2-tests and continuous variables were compared using t-test for independent samples. To evaluate the treatment effectiveness, based on intention-to-treat, univariate and multivariate Linear Mixed Models (LMM) analysis was performed. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education, site of inclusion (BSA or ETZ), primary diagnosis, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores, Type D personality, baseline anxiety scores, and baseline depression scores. F values with two-sided p-values are reported for main and interaction effects (group*time). For the estimated fixed effects, coefficients with two-sided p-values are reported. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software package (version 24). 6116 117RESULTS AND FEASIBILITY OF THE DO CHANGE 1 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CHAPTER 6 RESULTS Sample The data collection took place between January 2017 and September 2017. In total, 286 eligible patients were approached for participation, of which 132 (46%) patients refused. An additional 5 (2%) participants did not show up or declined participation. Reasons for refusal included that it would be too time-consuming, not wanting to be confronted with their heart disease every day, and being reluctant to use technology. A total of 149 (response 52%) patients were enrolled. Enrollment per study site was as follows: BSA randomized a total of 74 (Intervention N= 37; CAU N=37) patients; ETZ randomized 75 patients (Intervention N = 37; CAU N=38). Of the total sample, 4 participants within the CAU condition dropped out, as they did not receive the intervention and were therefore not willing to continue. Of the patients randomized to the intervention condition, 82% (N = 6 1 ) reported having completed the entire three-month program. Overall, 97% (N = 145) of the participants completed the follow-up assessments. Figure 2 represents the flowchart of the patient recruitment. Baseline characteristics The mean age of the total sample was 63.6\u00b1 8.3 years old and 66% were men. There were significant differences observed in mean completed education in years between the intervention group (M = 1 4.3, SD = 6.2) and the CAU group (M = 1 1 .8, SD = 7 .9, p =.033). This means that patients in the intervention group completed more years of education in comparison to the care as usual group. Furthermore, a significant difference between the two groups was found on the mean PHQ-9 baseline scores, with a higher mean score on depressive symptoms in the CAU group (M = 3.61\u00b13.6 vs. 5.56\u00b14.17, p =.003). No other differences were found between the intervention and Care as usual group. Table 1 presents an overview of the baseline characteristics of the current sample. FIGURE 2.

After adjusting for covariates (as previously described), main effects for time (F (1, 146.81) = 1.74, p = .18), group (F (1, 149.00) = .48, p = .07), and group*time (F (2, 146.81) = 1.13, p = .33) remained non-significant (Fig. 3). These findings indicate that behavioral flexibility scores did not significantly change over time, and that there were no differences between the two groups. With regard to covariates included into the model, the estimated fixed effects of hypertension ( = -5.71, p = .01), coronary artery disease ( = -5.42, p = .02), and depression ( = -.67, p = .04) were significantly associated with lower levels of behavioral flexibility scores (across all time points).In addition, site of recruitment was associated with behavioral flexibility scores, with only patients from Spain showing an increase in behavioral flexibility over time ( = 5.81, p <.01 ) when compared to The Netherlands (see Table 2). Lifestyle Univariate analysis showed no significant effect for group (F (1, 434.91) = .91, p = .34) or group*time (F (2, 282.73) = .39, p = .68). These findings present that, without the addition of possible confounding variables, the intervention and CAU group did not differ. Also, no interaction effect between allocation to group and time was found. However, a significant improvement for both groups on overall reported lifestyle behavior was found (F (2, 282.73) = 4.28, p =.02).When adjusting for covariates in the multivariable analysis, this improvement remains significant (F (2, 146.63) = 9.99, p < .001). As shown in Figure 3, both groups reported improvements in lifestyle behavior over time. The effects of interaction (F (2, 147.02) = 1.36, p = .26) and allocation to group (F (1, 149.90) = .09, p = .77) remained non-significant in the adjusted models. This indicates that no effect of the intervention on healthy lifestyle behavior was found. The estimated fixed effect of depression ( =-1.88, p < 001 ) was negatively associated with lifestyle promoting behavior indicating that patients who score higher on depression scale report lower healthy lifestyle behaviors. Patients from Spain showed an increase in lifestyle behavior ( = 11.95, p <.001), in comparison to The Netherlands (see Table 2). Quality of life Results of the univariate analysis of the quality of life total scores showed an interaction effect between time and group (F (2, 146.40) = 4.22, p = .02). This finding indicates that the mean scores on quality of life of the intervention and care as usual group have different slopes over time: the intervention group shows a small improvement in the quality of life after three months, whereas the care as usual group reports a small decline in quality of life (mean improvement = 1.11 \u00b1 .11 vs. -1.47 \u00b1 .11) . Both groups stabilize to baseline level after six months. The interaction effect remained significant after adding the covariates in the multilevel analysis (F (2, 146.52) = 4.29, p = .02) (Fig. 3), suggesting a significant, positive effect of the intervention on self-reported quality 6120 121RESULTS AND FEASIBILITY OF THE DO CHANGE 1 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CHAPTER 6 of life in the first three months. The estimated fixed effects of higher levels of education ( = .25, p = .006), and being recruited in Spain ( = 3.86, p =.008) as compared to The Netherlands were significantly associated with higher scores on quality of life. Lower scores were predicted by Type D personality ( = -3.94, p = .02) and depression ( = -1.83, p <.001) (see Table 2). Examining sub-scales of the WHO-QoL revealed no specific subscale differences regarding response patterns to the intervention. TABLE 2.

Acceptability and satisfaction Overall, patients in the intervention group indicated being satisfied with the intervention (M = 26.22, SD = 4.82). The intervention was experienced as useful (M = 13.88, SD = 3.96) and easy to use (M = 17.07, SD = 2.57). Patients did not feel social pressure to use the devices from the intervention (M = 9.85, SD = 3.63) and reported to be quite satisfied with the possibilities to receive support (M = 15.44, SD = 2.43), and had a neutral opinion regarding the pleasure in using the devices offered in the intervention (M = 10.63, SD = 2.44). Furthermore, the intervention was integrated relatively well in patients' lives (M = 11.71, SD = 3.05). However, patients indicated that they were neutral regarding the intention to use the ecosystem in the future (M = 8.40, SD = 3.34). DISCUSSION The current study aimed to provide proof of concept for the Do CHANGE behavioral intervention targeting behavioral flexibility, lifestyle change, and quality of life in cardiac patients. No significant differences between the groups were observed on behavioral flexibility and lifestyle. However, a small increase in quality of life at 3 months was observed in the intervention group, but at 6 months no significant difference between the groups was observed. With respect to the usefulness and feasibility of the intervention, the current findings revealed that the ecosystem is experienced as useful, easy to use and integrated well into the daily life of the patients. It made the participants more aware of the fact that they must undertake activities themselves to feel better. Patients also reported feeling more 'safe', because healthcare professionals were watching along. Non-adherence is a common issue in web-based interventions for promoting health-related behavior, and the average study results in only 50% of participants adhering to the intended intervention.22 However, 82.4% of the patients participating in the present Do CHANGE intervention condition completed the intervention, which may further indicate that the intervention was not perceived as demanding. The present findings are not completely in line with previous studies in other patient populations.13 An explanation for this discrepancy could be the fact that this was the first study implementing the concept of behavioral flexibility, and thus the core Do's of the Do Something Different program in the cardiac population. In addition, the Do's might not have been tailored enough to the patients' needs, that the timing of the Do's might not have been optimal. For example, one would want a patient to receive a distractive Do at the time when the 'unwanted' behavior occurs. In the current trial, patients from two different cultures (Spain and The Netherlands) and diagnosed with different cardiac disorders (HT, HF, or CAD) were enrolled. This reflects the heterogeneity of the sample which may have affected the results. Another important area for future research is the exploration of the mediating factors that drive the interplay between behavioral flexibility, lifestyle factors and quality of life in the setting to e-Health interventions. Enrolment in the study may have increased the general awareness of lifestyle change in both groups. This awareness could unknowingly lead to adaptation of lifestyle, 6122 123RESULTS AND FEASIBILITY OF THE DO CHANGE 1 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CHAPTER 6 independent of the allocation to group. Previous research in cardiac patients affirms that there is a relation between general knowledge about cardiac risk factors and self-reported lifestyle changes in the short term.23 Furthermore, even though lifestyle change is crucial in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, there is a lack of emphasis on lifestyle change and self-care of the patient in the current healthcare systems.24 Addressing self-care and lifestyle change in clinical practice is therefore warranted. The Do CHANGE trial provides (longitudinal, momentary) knowledge that can be used in the further development of personalized interventions that will help patients reach recommended lifestyle goals. Behavioral flexibility is an important construct on which behavioral change can possibly be initiated. However, current results may indicate the need for a better measurement tool, as the questionnaire that is used might not be sensitive enough to reveal significant alteration in patients' behavioral flexibility over time. Findings on quality of life on the other hand are in line with was is found in previous studies in cardiac samples, which have shown that there is a decline in quality of life and generally a slight increase in anxiety and depression scores within the 3 months post cardiac event.25 This could be explained by patients having to adapt to new behaviors after visiting the hospital and being reminded of the fact that they have a chronic illness. Furthermore, the intervention group in current sample received the behavioral program, which could have contributed to first an increase of their quality of life, with a slow decrease after 3 months, sustaining their baseline quality of life, After the behavioral intervention ends the quality of life in the intervention group also goes down as the additional 'support' is no longer provided. The present findings must be interpreted in light of a few limitations. At baseline, the intervention group and care as usual group showed some differences in mean years of completed education and mean scores on depressive symptoms. The care as usual group scored significantly higher on both variables. Another limitation of the current study was that the sample was rather small, in relatively good health, and clinically heterogeneous, which may have limited the possibility to find substantial effects. Although the intervention was positively evaluated by participants, half of the approached patients did refuse participation. Therefore it can be concluded that eHealth interventions like currently described are appealing for certain subgroups of patients. Future research should focus on eHealth interventions within the cardiac population based on a larger sample with significant power that is assessed over a prolonged follow-up duration (e.g., beyond six months) to draw firm conclusions on sustainable behavior change. Current results showed that depression was associated with negative behavioral and psychological outcomes which is in line with previous findings.26 Depressive symptoms are common in patients with cardiovascular disease 27-29 and are related to various behavioral risk factors (e.g., sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet, alcohol over-consumption, and smoking),30,31 this may explain the relation between depression and lower lifestyle behavior scores. Hence, future research is needed to examine which psychological and clinical factors contributing to health behavior change and potentially address these factors during the intervention. For clinical practice it is important to acknowledge that technology and eHealth solutions might be the feasible way forward in meeting patient needs and initiated health behavior change. However, current findings underline the importance of a personalized approach that includes the assessment of patient's demographic, clinical and psychological profile. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the Do CHANGE 1 intervention was perceived as useful and easy to use. However, no main effects were found on behavioral flexibility, lifestyle behavior, and quality of life. More research is warranted to examine which components of behavioral interventions, and in which patients, are effective in producing long-term behavior change.

Habibovi on behalf of the Do CHANGE consortium Under review7128 129RESULTS FROM THE DO CHANGE 2 TRIAL CHAPTER 7 ABSTRACT Objective: Unhealthy lifestyle factors have adverse outcomes in cardiac patients. However, only a minority of patients succeed to change unhealthy habits. Personalization of interventions may result in critical improvements. The current randomized controlled trial provides a proof of concept of the personalized Do CHANGE 2 intervention and evaluates effects on: 1) lifestyle, and 2) quality of life over time. Methods: Cardiac patients (N=150; mean age=61.97\u00b111.61 years; 28.7% N=33, coronary artery disease N=50, hypertension N=67) recruited from Spain and The Netherlands were randomized to either the 'Do CHANGE 2' or 'Care as Usual' group. The Do CHANGE 2 group received ambulatory health-behaviour assessment technologies for six months combined with a 3-month behavioural intervention program. Linear Mixed Models (LMM) analysis were used to evaluate the intervention effects and latent class analysis (LCA) was used for secondary subgroup analysis. Results: LMM analysis showed significant intervention effects for lifestyle behaviour (Finteraction(2,138.5)=5.97, p =.003), with improvement of lifestyle behaviour in the intervention group. For quality of life, no significant main effect (F(1,138.18)=.58, p=.447) or interaction effect (F(2,133.1)=0.41, p=.67) were found. Secondary LCA revealed different subgroups of patients per outcome measure. The intervention was experienced as useful and feasible. Conclusion: The personalized eHealth intervention resulted in significant improvements in lifestyle. Cardiac patients and health care providers were also willing to engage in this personalized digital behavioural intervention program. Incorporating eHealth lifestyle programs as part of secondary prevention would be particularly useful when taking into account which patients are most likely to benefit.INTRODUCTION Approximately 17 million deaths per year can be attributed to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), making it the leading cause of death worldwide.1 In Europe only, 4 million deaths per year are caused by CVDs.1 In addition to the increased mortality risk, significant disease burden associated with morbidities has been reported,2 which in turn contributes to an increased demand on the healthcare system and individual patients' quality of life.3 It is well established that health risk behaviours (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption, poor-quality diet, physical inactivity) are associated with the onset and prognosis of CVDs.4 In the healthy population, 80% of the CVDs could be prevented by the elimination of these risk factors.5 Furthermore, a trivial modification of risk behaviours on an individual level in patients with CVD could halve the mortality rates.6 Accordingly, the European Society of Cardiology emphasizes, in their recent guidelines on prevention, the importance of modification of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and implementation of secondary preventive strategies in patients with CVDs.7 Changing (unhealthy) behaviour is challenging, as studies show that the majority of patients fails to reach the recommended health targets.8 Previous research shows that the impact of the traditional behavioural interventions is restrained by the potential reach, adherence difficulties, and inability to intervene upon health behaviour in real time (e.g. in moments when patients most need help and thus intervention is likely to be more effective).9,10 In addition, while personalized interventions are increasingly advocated, it is still unknown which patient (sub) groups should be targeted with which interventions in order to increase their effects. Using new statistical methods could shed light on this aspect. The emergence of digital health interventions with technological tools to monitor (risk) behaviour, support behaviour change, and potentially improve health outcomes are promising solutions in order to overcome some of these difficulties.11-13 Despite the potential benefits of e-health applications for behaviour change (e.g. low threshold), a recent review showed that interventions based on a single smartphone app do not significantly improve objectively measured physical activity levels.14 Insight into the amount of health behaviors targeted and follow-up duration for optimal effectiveness of interventions is warranted. Furthermore, it is stated that these interventions lack personalization and may not be generalizable across different (cultural) groups and languages.15 In addition, there is a need for the integration of theory driven behavioural change techniques, which can guide behaviour change within the offered interventions.16 Hence, in the current study, a system has been developed that combines the theory-driven behaviour change technique 'Do Something Different (DSD)' with new technologies in order to provide personalized care that meets patients' needs with regard to behaviour change. The DSD program aims to increase behavioral 7130 131RESULTS FROM THE DO CHANGE 2 TRIAL CHAPTER 7 flexibility in order to change unhealthy habits. This concept is referred to as the ability of a person to express behaviour more context-dependent (i.e. showing a broader range of the behavioural repertoire),17 which will potentially lead to the adoption of new behaviours by being more open to experience.18 In order to increase behavioural flexibility, the DSD program challenges people \"to step out of there comfort zone\" by disrupting their daily routine with brief tailored messages called 'To Do's' (e.g. Be more outgoing today. Initiate a conversation with someone you don't usually speak to ).18 It is hypothesized that having a bigger behavioural repertoire will make it easier to engage in alternative (healthier) behaviours and thus, in combination with (wearable) technologies, lead to a sustained healthier lifestyle in patients with HT and/or CVD. Hence, the current study will evaluate the feasibility of the personalized eHealth intervention, and examine its effects on 1) lifestyle change, and 2) quality of life. Additionally, in the subgroup analysis, it will be assessed which patients are most likely to benefit from the intervention. METHODS Design The multicenter international project Do Cardiac Health Advanced New Generation Ecosystem (Do CHANGE) project consists of two distinct studies. Trial 1 (Do CHANGE 1), registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02946281), has served as an input for the development of the currently described trial 2 (Do CHANGE 2 - NCT03178305), and is outlined in more detail elsewhere.19 Recruitment for this second trial took place at three pilot sites (Elisabeth-Tweesteden Ziekenhuis (ETZ) in the Netherlands, Badalona Serveis Assistencials (BSA) in Spain and Buddhist Tzu-Chi Dalin General Hospital in Taiwan (BTCD)). However, because of slightly different recruitment strategies between the different countries, analysis and results presented in this article consist of patients recruited in ETZ and BSA only. The feasibility of the intervention will be reported for all three recruitment sites (the Netherlands, Spain and Taiwan). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the participating study sites and all patients provided informed consent prior to participating in this project. Study sample Patients screened for eligibility were primarily diagnosed with hypertension (HT) (systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg at two different measurements spaced 1-2 minutes apart and after 3-5 minutes in a sitting position), coronary artery disease (CAD) (having experienced a myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, percutaneous coronary intervention and/or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), or symptomatic heart failure (HF) Inclusion criteria: age 18-75 years, a primary diagnosis of CAD, HF, or HT that required routine outpatient follow-up by a cardiologist, sufficient knowledge of the countries' native language, access to the Internet at home, having a smartphone that is compatible with the applications used in the study, and having sufficient knowledge on how to use a personal computer and smartphone. In addition, patients were screened to have two or more of the following risk factors: positive family history, increased cholesterol, current smoking status, diabetes mellitus, sedentary lifestyle, and/or psychosocial risk factors (depression or anxiety). For HF patients, additional inclusion criteria include a diagnosis of systolic or diastolic HF and the presence of HF symptoms (e.g., fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain). Exclusion criteria: life expectancy <1 year, life-threatening comorbidities (e.g. malignancy), with a history of psychiatric illness other than anxiety and/or depression, significant cognitive impairments (e.g. dementia), and on the waiting list for heart transplantation. In total, N = 557 eligible patients were approached for participation between July 2017 and November 2017 in Spain and The Netherlands. Of this total, eight (1%) patients were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (e.g. no smartphone, psychiatric illness). Of the remaining 549 patients, 399 (72%) refused participation (because of lack of motivation, too time-consuming, issues regarding privacy, too confronting, and being reluctant to using technology), leaving N = 150 patients (27%) ( S pa i n N = 7 5, The Nethe rl a nd s N = 7 5 ) f o r ra nd o m i zati o n t o th e Do C HAN G E 2 intervention (N = 76) versus Usual Care group (N = 74). See Figure 1 for a detailed flow diagram of patient recruitment. Procedure Patients were approached between June 2017 and December 2017 by the attending cardiologist or nurse practitioner during a regular outpatient clinic visit. Eligible patients were informed about the study both in writing and verbally. Ten days after having received this information, patients were contacted by phone to establish their interest in participating. If patients indicated to be interested in participation, the informed consent form and baseline self-report questionnaire were send at home with the request to return them within ten working days. After receiving both the baseline questionnaire and the signed informed consent form, patients were randomized to either the care as usual or the intervention group. An outpatient clinic visit was 7132 133RESULTS FROM THE DO CHANGE 2 TRIAL CHAPTER 7 scheduled in case the patient was randomized to the intervention condition. During this appointment, patients received information about the use of associated devices and details related to the intervention (see description under heading 'intervention'). The next day, patients in the intervention group were contacted by telephone to check that the devices were installed correctly and that the system was functional. FIGURE 1. Flow diagram of the patient recruitmentAfter three (T1) and six months (T2) all participants received the follow-up questionnaires at home and were requested to send these back within two weeks. Patients were contacted by telephone when the questionnaires were not filled out within the given period. Participants received up to two reminder calls. Upon completion of the intervention at the six-month follow-up, the research assistant scheduled a visit to collect the devices that were provided. Randomization Participants were randomized (2:2) to either the intervention group or the care as usual group (CAU) using computerized block randomization (stacks of 4). The computer generated randomization sequences and these were sealed by an independent researcher before recruitment started. When a patient had completed the questionnaires, one sealed envelope was drawn by the research assistant containing the group allocation. Because of the nature of the ambulatory monitoring and device- related aspects of the study, blinding health care providers or participants was not possible. Intervention Behavior change techniques Patients allocated into the intervention group all received a behavior change program 'Do Something Different' (DSD) for three months, which aimed to change unhealthy habits by increasing behavioural flexibility. Based on the patients' personality profile (assessed by a study-developed questionnaire) and incoming data from the wearable devices (for example, daily step count or GPS locations), short interrupting messages called 'Do's' were send to patients' mobile phones on a daily basis (example: \" GO SOMEWHERE NEW. It's time for a change. Explore a new area on foot, or walk down a street you have never been on \"), with the aim of motivating patients to move out of their comfort zone and therefore making them more prone to change. These messages challenge patients to do something different. They have been developed by a multidisciplinary team including cardiologists and psychologists in order to make sure that the Do's apply to the patient population and are thus related to their daily behaviors / needs. For example, because of disease-specific symptoms, advice regarding fluid intake was taken into account within the program only for patients with HF. Patients received a total of 32 Do's during the 3 months intervention period (2-3 Do's every week). As per protocol, the behavioral intervention was stopped at the 3-month follow-up. The program showed promising results regarding behavior change in previous samples.20 For a more detailed description of the intervention we would like to refer the reader to the previously published protocol.19 7134 135RESULTS FROM THE DO CHANGE 2 TRIAL CHAPTER 7 Technological tools Along with the behavioral intervention program, all patients received technological (wearable) devices in order to obtain objective measures on patients' physical functioning for the entire follow-up period of six months (also after the discontinuation of the DSD program at three months, in order to assess an objective measure of the behavioral intervention), also during the time period when the behavioral prompts were stopped. These wearables included a Fitbit smart watch (e.g. step count), a Beddit sleeptracker (e.g. sleep efficiency), the Careportal (i.e. home monitoring device for measuring ECG and daily symptoms), blood pressure monitor, weight scale (only in patients with HF), the Moves app, the Vire app (i.e. Do CHANGE app, especially developed for data integration of the different wearables to provide a comprehensive overview for the patients, in order to provide a user-friendly summary of the results and prevent participants from getting overwhelmed). In addition, via the Vire app patients were able to send in pictures of three meals each day. Patients were able to see their own data continuously. Because the present manuscript focuses on patient- reported outcomes, the current analyses do not include specific data obtained from the ambulatory monitoring devices. A more detailed description of the intervention and other trial-related details has previously been published.19 Patients in the intervention condition received weekly phone calls to assess their progress with the intervention. Patients could also access their personal data from the wearable devices or the Vire app. The weekly feedback that was provided was based on checking whether patients were able to keep up with their goals (e.g. number of steps and healthy meals) with respect to physical activity and diet. Care as usual Patients randomized to the care as usual condition did not receive the behavioral intervention prompts or the wearable and monitoring devices. They were provided with validated questionnaires at baseline, three, and six months after follow-up, similar to the active treatment group. Patients in this condition received the treatment as usual (e.g. regular outpatient hospital visits). Measures Primary outcome measures Lifestyle The Health Promotion Lifestyle Profile (HPLP-II) questionnaire was administered to assess health-promoting lifestyle habits. This self-report survey evaluates whether the subjective perception of patients regarding their lifestyle is changed, and consists of 52 items in total (e.g., \"Eat 6-11 servings of bread, cereal, rice, and pasta each day\").21 Each item can be answered on a 4-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (routinely). The total score can, therefore, range from 52 to 208, with a higher score indicating a better lifestyle. The internal consistency is reported as excellent.21 Current sample has a Cronbach's of 0.92. Quality of Life To determine changes in quality of life, participants completed the World Health Organization Quality of Life - BREF (WHOQOL-BREF).22 The WHOQOL-BREF is considered a reliable generic multi-dimensional quality of life measure and consists of 26 items. Two items refer to the facets Overall Quality of Life and General Health, whereas the abiding 24 items reflect four different domains (Physical Health, Psychological Health, Social Relationships, and Environment).22 The internal consistency is good (Cronbach's = 0.66 to 0.80).23 Cronbach's of current sample is 0.91. Feasibility Usability and Acceptance The Unified Theory of Acceptance (UTAUT2) questionnaire was administered to assess the perceived usability and acceptance of the tools that were used in the intervention. This self-administered questionnaire consists of 28 Likert scale items (e.g., \"The service was easy to use\"), ranging from 1 (totally not agree) to 5 (totally agree).24 All items can be categorized into eight scales, namely: 1) Performance expectancy, 2) Effort expectancy, 3) Social influence, 4) Facilitating conditions, 5) Hedonic motivation, 6) Habit, 7) Behavioral intention, and 8) Price value.24 The total score per subscale can range from 4 to 20, with a higher score indicating more agreement with the statements within a certain subscale. Because of the ambiguity towards potential future costs of the ecosystem in the scale, the 'Price Value' subscale was excluded. Current sample has a Cronbach's of 0.95. Satisfaction To assess the satisfaction of the patients about the ecosystem, The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) was used. This self-administered questionnaire is a general scale that consists of 8 Likert scale items (e.g. \"To what extent has our program met your needs?\" ) ranging from 0 to 4, with response descriptors that vary. The overall score can range from 8 to 32, with a higher score indicating a higher satisfaction.25 The internal consistency is rated as excellent (Cronbach's = 0.92).25 Cronbach's of current sample is 0.95. 7136 137RESULTS FROM THE DO CHANGE 2 TRIAL CHAPTER 7 Demographic, clinical and psychological background factors Demographic and clinical data Demographic (age, sex, marital status, working status, educational status, and smoking behavior) and clinical data (comorbidities, prescribed cardiac medication, prescribed psychotropic medication, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the past, and resting heart rate, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure (measured during the last outpatient visit) were obtained from patients' medical record and by self-report. Psychological measures Type D personality Type D personality was assessed by using the Type D scale (DS-14). This 14-item questionnaire consists of two subscales with seven 5-point Likert scale items each, ranging from 0 (false) to 4 (true).26 Total scores on both subscales range from 0 to 28. The two subscales represent the characteristics of negative affectivity (NA) (e.g., the tendency to experience negative emotions across time and situations) and social inhibition (SI) (e.g., the tendency not to express feelings). When scoring 10 on both subscales, patients were classified as Type D. With reported Cronbach's of 0.86 and 0.88 respectively the internal consistency of SI and NA are considered as satisfactory.26 Current sample has a Cronbach's of 0.91. Anxiety The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale was conducted to gauge self- administered symptoms of anxiety. The questionnaire is comprised of 7 items (e.g. \"Feeling afraid as if something terrible might happen\") that can be answered on a 4-point Likert-scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (almost every day).27 To get an indication of anxiety symptom severity, the total score (range from 0 to 21) can be used. A higher score implies higher levels of anxiety. With a Cronbach's of 0.92, the internal consistency is considered excellent.27 Cronbach's of current sample is 0.85. Depression Depressive symptoms were administered at each time point by using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).28 This self-report questionnaire consists of 9 items in total (e.g. \"Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\"), each evaluated on a 4-point Likert-scale (i.e., not at all, several days, nearly every day). The total score ranges from 0 to 27, with a higher score as an indication of worse depression symptom severity. The internal consistency is considered excellent (Cronbach's = 0.90).29 Current sample has a Cronbach's of 0.79.Statistical analyses Discrete variables were presented as frequencies and percentages and compared using Chi2 - tests. Continuous variables were compared using independent-tests (data shown as mean values and standard deviations -SD). If a questionnaire had <80% missing entries, data were imputed using the mean score of the patient on the available completed items. Feasibility was assessed by calculating mean values and standard deviations. To evaluate the treatment effectiveness univariable and multivariable Linear Mixed Models (LMM) analyses over three time points (i.e., baseline (T0), 3- (T1), and 6 months (T2)) were performed. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, gender, education, site of inclusion (BSA or ETZ), primary diagnosis, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores, Type D personality, baseline anxiety scores, and baseline depression scores. Subgroup analyses on patients in the intervention condition were conducted using the Latent Gold software.30 We applied a repeated measures latent class analysis (RMLCA) to identify qualitatively distinct latent classes representing change in the primary outcomes (i.e. lifestyle behavior, QoL) over three time points (i.e., baseline (T0), 3- (T1), and 6 months (T2)). Hence, each class represents a distinct trajectory of each outcome over a 6-month period. To determine the optimal number of classes in the model, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used for model selection.31 A lower value of this goodness of fit measure indicates that a particular model shows better fit than a model with a higher value on the fit index. The Full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation procedure used in both the LMM and RMLCA, was aimed at handling missing values on variables that were measured at multiple time points (lifestyle behavior, QoL). Missing values on time invariant predictor variables were handled using mean imputation.31 The association between class membership and baseline demographic (completers vs. non-completers, age, sex, educational level, and marital status), baseline clinical (primary diagnosis HT, CAD or HF) and CCI) and baseline psychological (anxiety, depression, and Type D personality) variables was investigated using multinomial logistic regression. Statistical significance of these predictors was assessed based on the Wald test. Finally, the LCA classes were exported in SPSS to further examine whether the different classes significantly changed between baseline and 6 months, using paired sample t-tests. P-values smaller than .05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS Baseline characteristics Of the total sample, 73.5% were men and the overall mean age was 61.97\u00b111.61 years. When comparing the Do CHANGE intervention group with the Care as Usual group on 7138 139RESULTS FROM THE DO CHANGE 2 TRIAL CHAPTER 7 baseline variables, a significant difference was observed in mean age, with participants in the intervention group being younger (M = 58.63, SD = 13.63) compared to the CAU group (M = 65.62, SD = 7.62; t (148) = -3.99, p < .001 (two-tailed)). Furthermore, the CAU group was more likely to have a higher use of psychotropic medication (15.8% vs. 31.1%, p =.03), and lower education level as compared to the intervention group (13.66\u00b15.78 vs. 11.11 \u00b1 7.08, p = .03). No other systematic differences were found between the two groups. An overview of the baseline characteristics of the current sample is presented in Table 1. Intervention effects on lifestyle and quality of life In Table 2 the main effects of group and time, and group*time on lifestyle and quality of life are displayed (as shown in Figure 2). For lifestyle, the results showed a significant group*time interaction making the interpretation of the main effects non informative. This indicates that the intervention group and the CAU group have different slopes over time. For quality of life, only a main effect of time was observed, indicating a significant change over time in both groups. Lifestyle Healthy lifestyle behaviours changed significantly over time (F unadjusted (2, 271.90) = 8.28, p < .001). When adding the covariates to the multivariate model, an interaction effect was found between time and group (F (2, 138.5) = 5.97, p = .003), indicating that both groups have different slopes over time, with the intervention group showing a stronger linear increase in lifestyle behaviour change scores over time than the change in the CAU group (see Figure 2). Depression ( = -2.19, p <.001) and Type D personality ( = -13.8, p < .001) significantly predicted less healthy lifestyle behaviour over 6 months. Older people ( = .25, p =.04) significantly healthier lifestyle behaviour. Being recruited in the Spain was related to healthier lifestyle behaviours in comparison to being recruited in the Netherlands ( = 18.94, p <.001). Quality of life Within the univariate analysis on the total QoL score, there was a significant change in QoL over 6 months for both groups (F (2, 135.42) = 9.63, p < .001). This effect remained significant in the multivariate analysis (F (2, 167.82) = 5.35, p = .006), indicating that both the intervention group and CAU group show a small decline in change scores on QoL after 3 months and improve again to the baseline level after 6 months (see Figure 2). Having more comorbid diseases ( = -2.03, p = .01), depression ( = -1.75, p < .001) and Type D personality ( = -8.06, p < .001) were related to a lower quality of life.TABLE 1: Baseline characteristics of the total sample (N = 238) Total (N=150) mean\u00b1SD; N (%)Do CHANGE intervention (N=76) usual (N=74) mean \u00b1SD; N (%)P value Study site .99 Spain 75 (31.5) 38 (50.7) 37 (49.3) The Netherlands 75 (31.5) 38 (50.7) 37 (49.3) Demographics Age (years) (80.7) 61 (80.3) 60 (81.1) .90 Working status (working) 50 (33.3) 30 (39.5) 20 (27.0) .11 Smoking (current) 22 (14.7) 10 (13.2) 12 (16.2) .60 Clinical characteristics Primary diagnosis .93 Diagnosis HF 33 (22.0) 16 (21.1) 17 (23.0) Diagnosis HT 67 (44.7) 35 (46.1) 32 (43.2) Diagnosis CAD 50 (33.3) 25 (32.9) 25 (33.8) Diabetes mellitus 33 (59.2) 42 (56.8) .76 Statins 54 (36.0) 33 (43.4) 21 (28.4) .06 ARB 50 (33.3) 23 (30.3) 27 (36.5) .42 Calcium antagonist 34 (22.7) 15 (19.7) 19 (25.7) .39 Psychotropic medication 35 (23.3) 12 (15.8) 23 (31.1) 3.49 .77 Type D personality (yes) 21 (14.0) 10 (13.2) 11 (14.9) HT=Hypertension; SBP=Systolic Blood Pressure; QoL = Quality of Life; * Measurement from last outpatient clinic visit before study enrollment 7140 141RESULTS FROM THE DO CHANGE 2 TRIAL CHAPTER 7 TABLE 2.

Classes related to lifestyle The best fitting model, according to the lowest BIC value, consisted of 3 classes (table 3). The three-class solution is presented in figure 3. Class 1 reflected younger patients with Type D characteristics (65%). This class showed a significant increase in lifestyle scores (t (43) = 5.96, p <.001). The second class (Class 2) described patients that are more likely to have a primary diagnosis of HF, experiencing low levels of depression and have no Type D characteristics (27%). This class showed a significant increase in lifestyle scores as well (t (16) = 3.63, p = .002). Finally, class 3 was characterized by patients with an older age that were more likely to have CAD as primary diagnosis, have more comorbidities and show characteristics of a Type D personality (8%). No significant change in scores was found for this group (t (5) = -.29, p = .79) (see Table 4). Note; baseline = 0; 3 months follow-up = 1; 6 months follow-up = 2 FIGURE 2.

The three-class solution is presented in figure 3. Class 1 represented patients with a low number of comorbidities that reported lower levels of anxiety and depression (46%). This class showed no significant change in quality of life scores (t (27) = .27, p = .79). The second class (Class 2) was characterized by patients with average characteristics the factors related to class membership (39%), although there was a trend for female sex and higher educated in this group. This class showed a significant improvement in QoL scores (t (28) = 4.44, p<.001). The final third class (Class 3) consisted of patients with less years of education, a higher number of comorbidities, and characteristics of Type D personality (16%). No significant change in scores for this class was found (t (9) = 1.26, p = .24) (see Table 5). TABLE 5.

Class solutions of the Latent Class Analysis on each outcome measure.Feasibility Overall, patients allocated to the intervention group were satisfied with the Do CHANGE 2 intervention (M = 27.11, SD = 4.38). The intervention was experienced as relatively useful (M = 1 6.09, SD = 3.46) and not difficult to use (M = 1 7 . 1 7 , SD = 2.73). Patients did not experience pressure of their spouses to use the devices offered within the intervention (M = 10.47, SD = 3.41). The possibilities to receive support with using the tools was considered as satisfactory (M = 16.30, SD = 3.17), and patients had a neutral opinion regarding the pleasure in using the devices (M = 1 0.70, SD = 2.70). Patients reported that the intervention was integrated well into their lives (M = 12.03, SD = 3.90). However, patients were standing neutral regarding the intention to use the devices in the future (M = 8.80, SD = 3.60). DISCUSSION The current study provides a proof of concept of an international, multi-faceted, eHealth intervention for lifestyle change in patients with heart failure, coronary artery disease and/or hypertension. Significant intervention effects were found for lifestyle behaviour. On the other hand, no significant effects were observed on the change in quality of life over the 6-month follow-up. Subgroup analysis revealed that different subgroups of patients could be distinguished with respect to their scores over time on each outcome measure. For example, a significant increase in scores in lifestyle behaviour was observed in patients with heart failure, no Type D personality, and low baseline depression scores. The current results also show that the patients experienced the intervention as useful and feasible. Previous RCTs on digital lifestyle interventions in the cardiac population have mainly focused on objective outcome measures (e.g. blood pressure, NYHA class, hospital admissions), because of the ability to diagnose and intervene based upon the incoming data.32 Patient reported outcomes are understudied as key outcome measures in clinical trials in cardiovascular populations, while they are essential for the development of an individualized approach of healthcare delivery and accurate predictors of objective disease-specific parameters.33,34 Current findings on the effect of the intervention on quality of life are in line with some 35 but not all 36 comparable studies. Overall, small and non-significant differences between intervention and usual care groups have been reported previously.35,37,38 This could possibly be attributed to an underpowered sample sizes and usage of general questionnaires instead of disease specific ones.39 Positive effects on patient reported outcomes are primarily found in studies with quasi- experimental research designs 39 and theory-driven interventions. Current findings with respect to the intervention effects on lifestyle behaviour are in line with previous 7146 147RESULTS FROM THE DO CHANGE 2 TRIAL CHAPTER 7 research, which has found a positive effect of eHealth on behaviour change in the cardiac population.12,16 However, these studies mainly focus on a specific cardiac patient population (e.g. CAD). The current study included a rather small and heterogeneous sample because of the different cultural backgrounds and underlying cardiac diseases. In combination with the complexity of the Do CHANGE 2 intervention as a multi-faceted eHealth intervention, it is difficult to draw conclusions about which component of the intervention specifically contributed to the intervention effects. As behavioural flexibility possibly could have led to behaviour change, a future recommendation would be to look into the operationalization and enhancement of flexibility in order to achieve sustained, long-term health behaviour change. Results of the subgroup analysis provided more insight into the degree and importance of personalization of technological interventions in order to be more effective.15 For example, previous research has shown that the usage of an eHealth intervention highly depends on participants' personal (e.g. age) and socioeconomic (e.g. education) characteristics.40 In a study on personalized lifestyle advice in adolescents, although a general effect of the intervention was found, the improvement on an individual level was highly variable.41 This implies that a more personalized approach might be the way forward in order to reach higher intervention effects. Taking into account patients' demographic, clinical, and psychosocial profiles and tailor the interventions to patients' preferences and needs 42 is of utmost importance for future studies and clinical practice. The LCA-based subgroups identified in this study may provide initial indications of where these individual differences could be found. Future studies are needed to focus on these individual differences as well as the timing of the intervention as patients' needs and preferences may vary over time. Finally, more research in the context of living with a chronic illness 43 and illness perceptions,44 motivation to change,45 goal-setting,46 self-efficacy,47 and social support 48 is required. For clinical practice it is important to be aware of individual differences between patients and accompanied needs with respect to how care should be offered and/or organized. From the current study it can be concluded that patients are willing to use eHealth interventions in order to improve their health. However, this might be more appealing to certain subgroups of patients and should not be offered to the whole population as not everybody would benefit equally. A few limitations need to be considered when interpreting the present study findings. The heterogeneous characteristics of the sample with respect to the primary diagnosis (i.e. HF, CAD, HT) and culture (i.e. Spain, The Netherlands) might have contributed to the results. In line with this, inclusion of the sample that was recruited in Taiwan for the current trial was not possible due to significant differences in patient recruitment. Due to logistic differences between the European health care organization and the Taiwanese, the sample from Taiwan comprised of patients mainly diagnosed with hypertension. Including these patients in the current analysis would have affected the results as it would be difficult to disentangle which variable is responsible for the observed differences between the groups. Furthermore, a low number of female patients was included in the study which could hamper the generalizability of the study findings and limit those to male patients only. In addition, patients randomized to the intervention group were younger and higher educated compared to the care as usual group, which may have influenced our results. This is however, in line with previous findings 49 showing that the current sample is representative for other eHealth RCT samples. In the current study therapist feedback was minor. As studies show that (therapist) feedback is of importance in order to increase adherence and intervention effects,50 this is certainly an important factor that should be incorporated in future studies. Finally, previous studies show that the level of patients' health literacy may affect the effectiveness of the study.51,52 It is unknown what the level of health literacy was in the current sample and whether this might have affected the outcomes of the study. Although self-reported lifestyle and quality of life are important in behavioural intervention research, future studies are needed to document changes in objective indices such as weight, actigraphy-based activity levels, blood pressure and disease- specific outcomes. In conclusion, the current study indicates that cardiac patients and health care providers are willing to engage in digital behavioural interventions in addition to standard care. Hence, clinical professionals could consider incorporating eHealth lifestyle programs as part of secondary prevention, taking into account which patients are most likely to benefit from personalized eHealth interventions.

Wetzels Piera-Jimenez J. Widdershoven M. Habibovi on behalf of the Do CHANGE consortium The American Journal of Cardiology, 2019;1-68154 155CHAPTER 8 DAILY MEASURES OF HEALTH RELATED OUTCOMES ABSTRACT Aim: The importance of modifying lifestyle factors in order to improve health related outcomes in cardiac patients has been advocated by many. Current study aims to evaluate the effects of a lifestyle intervention on changes in lifestyle- and health data derived from wearable devices. Method: Seventy cardiac patients from Spain (N = 34) and The Netherlands (N = 36) were included in the current analysis as part of the Do CHANGE trial. Data were collected for 210 days, using the Fitbit activity tracker, Beddit sleep tracker, Moves app (GPS tracker), and the Careportal home monitoring system. Locally Weighted Error Sum of Squares (LOESS) regression was performed to assess trajectories of outcome variables. Linear Mixed Effects (LME) regression analysis was used to find relevant predictors of improvement deterioration of outcome measures. Results: Analysis showed that both Number of Steps and Activity Level significantly changed over time (F =58.21, p<.001; F=6.33, p=.01). No significant changes were observed on blood pressure, weight, and sleep efficiency. Secondary analysis revealed that being male was associated with higher activity levels (F=12.53, p<.001) and higher number of steps (F=8.44, p<.01). Secondary analysis revealed that patients demographic (gender, nationality, marital status), clinical (comorbidities, heart failure), and psychological (anxiety, depression) profile were associated with lifestyle measures. Conclusion: Current results showed that physical activity increased over time and that certain subgroups of patients were more likely to have a better lifestyle behaviors than others based on their demographic, clinical and psychological profile. This advocates a personalized approach in future studies in order to change lifestyle in cardiac patients.INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally.1 It is well known that modifiable (behavioral) risk factors (e.g. sedentary lifestyle, low sleep efficiency) are associated with increased mortality risk and disease progression.1 Hence, the implementation of effectual lifestyle interventions within this population might contribute to better health outcomes, and reduce the economic and healthcare burden of CVD.2 In order to reach this goal, cost -effective, technology based approaches may be the way forward 3 as they have shown promising results with respect to changes in a variety of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (e.g. physical activity,4 sleep efficiency,5 blood pressure regulation6) . As compared to traditional, self-report measures, wearable (consumer)sensors provide opportunities to assess lifestyle behavior patterns in a more accurate and ecological valid manner.7,8 Hence, current study aims to 1) evaluate changes in objectively measured lifestyle- and health data derived from wearable devices and 2) examine which demographic, psychosocial, and clinical predictors are associated with improvement/deterioration of these measures. METHODS The current study was part of an international, multicenter randomized controlled trial, the Do Cardiac Health Advanced New Generation Ecosystem 2 (Do CHANGE 2- NCT03178305) study. This trial was primarily designed to evaluate a multicomponent digital intervention on lifestyle change in cardiac patients that is described in more detail elsewhere.9 Current sample is constituted from patients diagnosed with hypertension (HT) (values 140 mmHg of systolic blood pressure and/or 90 of diastolic blood pressure in two different measurements spaced 1-2 minutes apart and after 3-5 minutes in a sitting position), symptomatic heart failure (HF) (New York Heart Association Class I-IV), or coronary artery disease (CAD) (having experienced angina pectoris, a myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention and/or coronary artery bypass), who were recruited between June 2017 and December 2017 in Spain and the Netherlands. Exclusion criteria existed of not having access to the Internet or a compatible smartphone, having insufficient knowledge of the local language (i.e. Spanish, Dutch), suffering from life-threatening comorbidities (e.g. malignancy), cognitive impairment, a life expectancy of <1 year, on the waiting list for heart transplantation, or having a history of psychiatric illness other than affective/anxiety disorders. Eligible patients who agreed to participate received a baseline questionnaire and an informed consent form at home and were requested to send these back within 10 working days. After receiving both the informed consent form and baseline 8156 157CHAPTER 8 DAILY MEASURES OF HEALTH RELATED OUTCOMES questionnaire, randomization (2:2) took place. Information about the devices (e.g. Fitbit\u00a9, Beddit\u00a9, Careportal monitoring) was provided to patients in the intervention group during a scheduled outpatient clinic visit. All participants were asked to fill out follow-up questionnaires at 3 and 6 months after baseline measurement and were requested to send these back within two weeks. Only patients randomized to the intervention group were analyzed for current study, because of the availability of sensor data. They were asked to use the Fitbit\u00a9, Beddit\u00a9, and Careportal daily over a period of 6 months (210 days). Randomization (2:2) to either the intervention or usual care group took place after receiving both the signed informed consent form and the questionnaire. An independent researcher generated and sealed computerized randomization sequences in stacks of 4 before recruitment started. Group allocation was determined by drawing a sealed envelope per patient by the research assistant. Blinding participants or healthcare providers was not possible due to the nature of the study. The study protocol was approved by Medical Ethics Committee (METC -Brabant - NL61660.028.17/P1726) in the Netherlands and is in line with the Helsinki declaration. Baseline clinical (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), main diagnosis (HT, CAD, HF)) and demographic (age, sex, marital status, site of inclusion, anxiety, depression, Type D personality) characteristics were assessed by reviewing patients' medical records and purpose-designed self-report questionnaires. Data sources were aggregated using the Do CHANGE platform,10,11 to securely collect and distribute data from 3rd party vendors to consortium partners. Data on physical activity and number of steps was collected by a personal Fitbit\u00a9 smartwatch.12 In case data on physical activity from Fitbit was unavailable, it was imputed by data from the Moves GPS app that was installed on patients' mobile phone. However, due to its better accuracy, physical activity data from Fitbit was preferred. The physical activity score was the estimate of the general activity over the day (combination of length of active periods and number of steps). The higher the score, the higher the physical activity. Data on sleep efficiency was derived by a Beddit 3\u00a9 sleeptracker.13 This device is certified to measure breathing, sleep, and heart rate. The Beddit uses ballistocardiography (BCG) to measure minute movements in the body resulting from breathing and a heartbeat. The input signal is subjected to several processing steps to filter out the breathing frequency, breathing intensity, heart rate, and various other parameters. The UA - 767 Plus digital blood pressure monitor was used in order to measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure on a daily basis. Blood pressure levels were logged into the Careportal by patients themselves.Participants from the three diagnosis groups recorded weight readings on a daily basis. Only HF patients received a Seca Aura 807 weight scale, because of the disease specific symptoms. Patients with CAD or HT used their own weight scale at home. Weight was inserted into the Careportal on a daily basis. Questionnaires at baseline included the DS-14 for Type D personality,14 the GAD-7 for symptoms of anxiety,15 and the PHQ9 for symptoms of depression.16 Descriptive statistics were calculated for the total intervention group, and displayed based on country of inclusion. Normally distributed continuous variables are presented as means \u00b1 SD and categorical variables as percentages. The ShapiroWilk test normality test was performed to decide whether a continuous variable was normally distributed. In case of a non-normal distributed continuous variable, this was described with median and interquartile range. Categorical variables were described using the Pearson's Chi- squared test. To obtain more robust results, the statistical analysis was performed on the weekly summarized value of each outcome variable. For the number of steps independently, its weekly summarized value was computed as the sum of all daily values. The non- parametric Locally Weighted Error Sum of Squares (LOESS) regression was applied in order to assess the trajectories of the outcome variables over time. This analysis fits a set of local regression lines that connect in order to draw a fluid line. Mean comparison methods were applied to assess (a) the change in the physical outcome variables in relation to baseline and (b) the change in the physical outcomes variables with regard to country (Spain or The Netherlands). In both cases, the non-parametric Wilcoxon test was applied. Linear Mixed-Effects (LME) modelling was applied to model the overall change of the physical outcome variables (Model 1) over the 6 month follow up, as well as to determine the effect of covariates (i.e. age, gender, marital status, culture (country of inclusion), Type D, depression, anxiety, CCI, main diagnosis) on these physical outcome variables (Model 2) over 6 months. P-values smaller than .05 are considered statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 557 patient from Spain and The Netherlands were approached for participation in the Do CHANGE trial Phase 2.9 Baseline assessment was filled in by 150 of these patients who were than randomized to either the intervention (N=76) or the care as usual (N=74) condition. Only the patients in the intervention group received the devices to monitor their lifestyle- and health parameters. Of the 76 patients who were randomized to the intervention condition, due to drop out (N=6), 70 patients were included in the current analysis (Spain: N=34; The Netherlands: N=36). At baseline, 8158 159CHAPTER 8 DAILY MEASURES OF HEALTH RELATED OUTCOMES the current results show that patients recruited in Spain were overall younger (p=.03), differed in their primary diagnosis from the Dutch sample (p=.02), and report higher anxiety levels as compared to patients recruited in The Netherlands (p=.02) ( Table 1 ).

Scores on both Number of Steps and Activity Level significantly changed over time (F =58.21, p<.001; F=6.33, p=.01 respectively) (see Figure 1 ). For the outcome variable 'Number of Steps', the multivariate analysis revealed that male gender was positively associated with the number of steps (F=8.44, p<.01) while having more comorbidities (CCI) was associated with a lower number of steps (F=7.15, p<.01). Patients recruited in The Netherlands also showed a significantly lower number of steps (F=13.70, p<.001). Patients' Activity Level was also positively associated with male gender (F=12.53, p<.001) and negatively with being recruited in The Netherlands (F=5.89, p=.02) ( Table 2 ). Focusing on Blood Pressure outcomes, no significant change over time was found for either diastolic (F=1.86, p=.17) or systolic blood pressure (F=3.43, p=.06), respectively. Results showed that having heart failure as main diagnosis was associated with lower systolic (F=6.09, p<.01) and diastolic (F=5.47, p<.01) blood pressure. Moreover, living together with a partner was also associated with lower diastolic blood pressure (F = 2.72, p = .04). Furthermore, a higher comorbidity index was associated with higher systolic blood pressure (F=7.37, p<.01) while being recruited in The Netherlands as associated with higher diastolic blood pressure (F=6.98, p=.01). Results with respect to Weight showed no significant change over time (F=0.36, p=0.55). Having more comorbidities (F=11.53, p<.01), being recruited in The Netherlands (F=6.88, p=.01), and having higher levels of depressive symptoms (F=5.78, p=.02) were associated with higher weight. While having higher levels of anxiety symptoms was associated with lower weight (F=8.80, p<.01). Finally, results on Sleep Efficiency showed also no significant change over time (F=2.21, p=0.14). Older age (F=5.44, p=.02) and a higher comorbidity index (F=5.37, p=.03) were both negatively associated with sleep efficiency. TABLE 2.

Trends in each outcome variable over the 6 months follow-up.DISCUSSION Current study evaluated the effects of a lifestyle intervention for cardiac patients on multiple objectively measured lifestyle- and health data that were collected using wearable devices. The analyses showed significant changes over time in the number of steps and activity level. No significant improvement over time was observed in other outcome measures (i.e. blood pressure, weight, and sleep efficiency). Secondary analysis revealed demographic (gender, nationality, marital status), clinical (comorbidities, heart failure), and psychological (anxiety, depression) profiles that were associated with lifestyle measures. Current findings are in line with the majority of previous studies that have focused on the use of wearable devices (i.e. accelerometers) in cardiac patients.17,18 However, due to the methodological differences between the studies it is somewhat challenging to compare the results. Current findings show an increase of activity levels at the start of the intervention, and a slow decrease over time. An explanation for this finding could be the discontinuation of the DSD behavioral intervention,19 and thus the lack of encouraging behavioral prompts between three and six months after baseline. Furthermore, only the first three months of the intervention patients were contacted by phone once a week in order to shortly discuss their health status and last achievements. This might have resulted in feeling more supported and motivated to engage in healthier behavior these first months, suggesting that blended care is the way forward for this patient population.20 Regarding sleep efficiency, no improvement was observed. The majority of previous studies that found positive associations between lifestyle interventions and (self-reported) sleep quality in cardiac patients focused primarily on patients with obesity and established obstructive sleep apnea.21 Current sample seems to be relatively healthy in this respect. Hence, no room for improvement was to be expected. Furthermore, the unfamiliarity with the Beddit device for participating patients might have influenced the results. As previous research has shown, devices that are already familiar for end-users predict a higher acceptance and utility rate.22 Another explanation could be the fact that current study focuses on multiple lifestyle behaviors. Sleep is considered as a modifiable lifestyle behavior, but might be a less prominent behavior to change compared to other risk factors (e.g. smoking, sedentary behavior).21 The focus of patients might therefore not be on improving sleep efficiency per se. Moreover, current sample showed a relatively high sleep efficiency rate on average on baseline, leaving little scope for improvement. As expected, a higher number of comorbid diseases showed to be related to less favorable objectively measured outcomes, as it significantly predicted a lower number of steps, higher systolic blood pressure, higher weight, and worse sleep efficiency. These findings are in line with previous research that shows that the complex interplay 8162 163CHAPTER 8 DAILY MEASURES OF HEALTH RELATED OUTCOMES of different comorbid diseases can impair patients' self-management,23 and thus may lead to worsening of clinical outcomes. Specific needs and shifting priorities regarding the care for coexistent diseases may be targeted in future interventions to enhance lifestyle behavior change in a personalized manner.24 Current findings indicate the importance of a personalized approach. For example, being male was significantly associated with an increase in physical activity levels and step count. This association was also found in a review on socio-ecological correlates of exercise among cardiac patients in rehabilitation settings.25 Males are more likely to engage in cardiac rehabilitation, as female patients differ in reported individual barriers (e.g. family responsibilities) and perceptions (e.g. tiring) of exercise.26 In addition, the need for this personalized approach was also observed regarding culture related differences in lifestyle behavior. Compared to Spain, being recruited in The Netherlands was a significant predictor of less favorable outcomes. Hence, future research should focus on assessing individual differences and preferences when developing behavioral interventions. Some limitations should be taken into account. First, current study is a secondary analysis of the Do CHANGE study, which has led to a relatively small sample size without a control-condition. Hence, it is not clear whether the results are attributable to the intervention. Second, technological issues (e.g. difficulty updating apps due to older mobile phones) may have possibly led to a less satisfactory data saturation. Finally, current study only focused on patients using wearable devices. However, in a recent systematic research on the predictors of acceptability of telemedicine in patient populations, Harst22 stressed the importance of a holistic approach (including partners, healthcare professionals, and institutions) regarding implementation. In addition, this holistic approach could be optimized by assessing and enhancing possible facilitating (psychological) patient characteristics (e.g. personality, coping style, and self- efficacy) that could serve as starting-points of more personalized, real-life integrated, and conceivably effective lifestyle interventions. Despite these before mentioned constraints, this is one of the first studies looking at ecologically assessed data of different lifestyle- and health related measures over a prolonged period of time within the cardiac population. In conclusion, current study has used a statistical analysis that takes advantage of the informative nature of the multiple data points collected by wearable devices over a prolonged period of time (i.e. 210 days). The results showed an improvement in physical activity over time. Secondary analysis showed that certain subgroups of patients are more likely to have better lifestyle behaviors, which advocates that more research is needed in order to disentangle which subgroups of patients might benefit the most from these types of interventions. A personalized approach might be the way forward in order to improve health outcomes in the future.

This dissertation has two overarching aims: 1) To increase understanding of the role of patient characteristics that affect health in patients with CVD. This aim is addressed in the first part of this dissertation, by examining psychological factors predicting health outcomes in a cohort of patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) who participated in a web-based eHealth intervention on distress reduction. Part two of this dissertation addresses the second aim: 2) To investigate the feasibility of an eHealth intervention that combines (wearable) technologies with a behavioral intervention in order to change health behaviors in patients with CVD. The third aim of this dissertation is: 3) T o identify subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit from eHealth interventions based on their demographic, psychosocial and/or clinical profile.AN OVERVIEW OF THE KEY FINDINGS Part I Patient characteristics and health: the WEBCARE trial Part I of this dissertation ( Chapters 2 - 4 ) focuses on the predictive value of psychological factors, particularly optimism and depressive symptoms, as related to multiple outcomes in patients receiving an ICD. The studies in this part of the dissertation are based on the WEBCARE study13-15 and focus on three types of outcomes: self-reported measures of mental and physical well-being, health care utilization, and clinical events (potentially life-threatening arrhythmias and mortality). The WEBCARE trial involves an eHealth intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy aimed at reducing distress in patients who received an ICD. The effects of the trial have been described elsewhere13,14 and the studies in this dissertation primarily focus on predictors of outcomes in both the active and control conditions of the WEBCARE trial. Evidence presented in Chapter 2 shows that higher dispositional optimism in patients with a first-implant ICD is associated with significantly lower anxiety and depressive symptoms 12 months post-implantation after adjustment for important demographic, personality, and clinical variables. Furthermore, high optimism was related to enhance mental health status at 12-months follow-up, but not with physical health status. The reduction of the predictive capacity of the optimism construct after adding covariates (Chapter 2 ) to the multiple regression models suggests that these risk factors may serve as mediating factors between optimism and specific outcomes in patients with an ICD. Based on these results, it can be concluded that identification of subgroup of patients with low levels of optimism may be useful in tailoring (eHealth) interventions that target psychological distress reduction. The findings are consistent with recent observations that short-term interventions focusing on positive psychological aspects may improve (clinical) outcomes in patients with CVD.16,17 It is important to document whether psychological factors predict health outcomes beyond mental and physical well-being, including health care utilization and clinical events. Chapter 3 presents results indicating that higher levels of depressive symptoms at the time of ICD placement are significantly predictive of increased healthcare utilization within the 12 months after implantation, independent of demographic and clinical covariates.18 The impact of depression on healthcare utilization is particularly prominent from 3 to 12 months post ICD implantation.18 These findings highlight the importance of timing of psychological risk factors, which has implications for when additional eHealth support could be offered to maximize impact on medical outcomes. In addition to wellbeing and health care utilization, clinical outcomes such as life- threatening arrhythmias and mortality are critical outcome measures in medical research. In Chapter 4 , it is examined whether specific personality traits in ICD patients are related to increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTa's) or mortality. The 9170 171GENERAL DISCUSSION CHAPTER 9 findings show that dispositional pessimism was associated with an increased risk of VTa's independent of demographic and clinical covariates. However, dispositional optimism and Type D personality were not associated with all-cause mortality nor with VTa's during 6 years of follow-up after implantation. No association between pessimism and all-cause mortality was found. The findings indicate that personality traits may be underlying to coexistent psychosocial factors that increase the risk of adverse cardiac outcomes. Examining the mechanisms of concomitant patient characteristics affecting the prognosis within this population would be of value for future research. The general pattern of results presented in Part I of this dissertation indicate that psychological factors predict clinical outcomes in patients receiving an ICD. However, the nature of the association depends on the type (e.g., valence and chronicity) of the psychological factor and the nature of the outcome measure (e.g., self-reported wellbeing or clinical outcomes that are not dependent on patients' self-report). Future research is needed to further explore the culprit aspects of psychological risk factors and how these components can be translated into targets for personalized interventions. Part II Mobile applications to enhance behavioral change: The Do CHANGE trial Part II of this study is based on the 'Do Cardiac Health Advanced New Generation Ecosystem' (Do CHANGE) trial. Whereas Part I focuses on psychological predictors of multiple outcomes in patients receiving an ICD in the context of an eHealth intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy, Part II addresses the feasibility and investigates multiple outcomes in a diverse group of patients with CVD who received a multi- component intervention that involved ambulatory monitoring of cardiovascular physiology, health behaviors and \"nudges\" targeting mental and physical wellbeing. The general conceptual model of the Do CHANGE trial builds on the construct of behavioral flexibility, which may impact health behaviors and quality of life. The integration of multiple ambulatory assessment tools for health-related behaviors (physical activity, sleep, dietary habits, cardiovascular measures (electrocardiogram, blood pressure), and personalized behavioral prompts via patients' smartphone are unique to this trial. Details about the trial and the overall study design of the Do CHANGE project are presented in Chapter 5 . The trial is a multicenter international (i.e., Spain, Taiwan, the Netherlands), randomized controlled trial that is based on technological innovations. These technical innovations were aimed to offer sustainable health behavior change in patients with CVD on a personalized and theory-driven manner. The trial was considered a proof of concept project and the primary objectives included i) disease management and lifestyle change, ii) improvement of patients' quality of life, and iii) change of behavioral flexibility and habits. Data were collected by patient-reported questionnaires as well as (wearable) technological devices administering assessed lifestyle behaviors (e.g., sleep quality, step count). Results of this project provide insights into the feasibility of eHealth interventions across different cultural backgrounds. The Do CHANGE project also provides new perspectives regarding the individual differences that may predict the effectiveness of the intervention. As described in more detail in Chapter 1, the Do CHANGE trial consisted of two phases, a feasibility component (trial 1) and an implementation component (trial 2). Chapter 6 presents the results of the first Do CHANGE trial (trial 1). A total of 149 patients was recruited from the Netherlands and Spain, and were randomized (2:2) to either the intervention or the care as usual group. The intervention was experienced as feasible and useful, and was integrated in the patients' life relatively well. Adjusted models showed no significant intervention nor time effects for behavioral flexibility over the 6 month duration of follow-up. Nevertheless, an improvement of self-reported healthy life style behavior was found for both groups over time, whereas intervention effects failed to reach significance. With regard to quality of life, a slight increase in scores was observed for the intervention group after 3 months. At 6 months, however, no difference between the groups was observed and scores returned to baseline level. As the Do's of the behavioral interventions were implemented in a sample of patients with CVD for the first time, these findings might reflect an inadequately tailored timing and personalized content of the messages. This underlines the necessity of addressing patients' demographic, clinical, and psychological profile in the development of effective future personalized eHealth interventions in patients with cardiovascular diseases. In Chapter 7 , results of patient reported outcomes of the second Do CHANGE trial were presented. Main analyses were performed on data from 150 cardiac patients recruited from Spain and The Netherlands. After six months follow-up, patients in the intervention condition reported significantly better healthy lifestyle behaviors compared to patients allocated to the care as usual condition. No intervention nor time effect was found for quality of life. A secondary subgroup analysis based on patients' demographic, psychological, and clinical profile revealed individual differences with regard to the effectiveness of the intervention. For instance, younger patients with type D personality characteristics reported significant increased lifestyle scores over the 6 months follow-up. Hence, focusing on individual differences might be the next step forward in designing eHealth interventions that suit patients' needs. This approach might also contribute to an increase of the intervention effects as the interventions would appeal more to the patients. Finally, healthcare professionals are encouraged to consider implementing eHealth interventions as part of secondary prevention as the current results showed that they are feasible and well accepted by the patients. 9172 173GENERAL DISCUSSION CHAPTER 9 Chapter 8 presents the results of the objectively measured, lifestyle- and health data (i.e., number of steps, physical activity, blood pressure, weight, and sleep efficiency) that were derived from the wearables used in the Do CHANGE 2 intervention. Data were collected for 210 days, and sufficient data saturation for 70 cardiac patients in total was achieved in order to perform analysis. Significant changes from baseline to 6 months follow-up were found for activity level and number of steps. However, changes in levels of blood pressure, weight and sleep efficiency were non-significant. Secondary analysis revealed that several patient-related characteristics (e.g., demographic, psychological, and clinical) were associated with changes in the outcome measures. For example, male sex was associated with a higher number of steps and activity level. These findings further underline the relevance of taking into account patients' individual profile when offering eHealth lifestyle interventions. In the next paragraphs, findings from this dissertation will be integrated into the existing literature in order to provide a broader perspective on the applicability of the outcomes. Furthermore, limitations of the dissertation and directions for future research and clinical practice will be described, followed by overall conclusions that can be drawn from the research findings presented in this dissertation. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDIES PRESENTED IN THIS DISSERTATION The preceding chapters of this dissertation encompass a detailed description of the strengths and limitations regarding the specific studies presented in them. Following remarks can therefore be interpreted in light of the general dissertation. A number of limitations in this regard must be acknowledged. First, data collected within the WEBCARE cohort might be debatable with respect to the representativeness for the current ICD population, given the technological innovations of the ICD over the last decennium. Second, the WEBCARE cohort comprised of physically and mentally relatively healthy patients, which might have affected the generalizability of results to the entire ICD population. Furthermore, the interaction between allocation to group and outcome measures encompassing the first part of this thesis was not assessed. Moreover, the Do CHANGE trials consisted of rather heterogeneous samples (e.g., different underlying heart diseases, different cultures), which might have influenced the results. In addition, it was not possible to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of the Do CHANGE intervention due to its multi-faceted nature, low statistical power, and absence of clear goal-setting. Lastly, data that were assessed in Taiwan could not be included in the analysis because of significant differences in patient recruitment when compared to the pilot sites in Europe. This can possibly be attributed to cultural differences or other factors that will need to be addressed in future research. One of the key strengths of this dissertation is that it provides insight into the acceptance and feasibility of eHealth interventions across a variety of cardiac populations. New technological innovations are used to gain information on objectively measured behavior and to provide care to a large group of people. The retention rate of Do CHANGE was in relation to other eHealth interventions in the cardiac population high (82.4%). Furthermore, a multi-method approach for data collection was used, providing opportunities to combine self-report outcome measures with objectively, daily measured behavioral and clinical data. These merits might contribute to further development of personalized interventions to enhance patients' wellbeing and improve cardiac prognosis. Finally, the amount of data derived from the trials embedded in current thesis has given a better understanding of the profile of patients who might benefit from offered interventions. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS AND E-HEALTH INTERVENTIONS Previous studies show that most patients with an ICD adjust well to it.19 Nevertheless, 25% to 33% of patients with an ICD encounter adaptation difficulties (e.g., (shock) anxiety, depression, reduction in quality of life) after implantation,20,21 and are therefore at greater risk for adverse cardiac outcomes. For example, distress in this patient population is associated with arrhythmias and mortality.22,23 In addition, Chapter 3 of this dissertation showed that elevated levels of depressive symptoms in ICD patients are associated with increased healthcare use one year after ICD implantation, irrespective of important covariates (e.g., shocks). Distress in ICD patients is often underrecognized,19 and associated physical as well as mental complaints are consecutively undertreated.24 This might, in turn, lead to a worse prognosis. In this regard, Chapter 4 showed that dispositional pessimism in ICD patients is associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias six years post implant. This could be explained by higher levels of sympathetic nervous system activation that may be associated with the interplay between dispositional pessimism and negative emotions (e.g., distress).25,26 The latter finding suggests that underlying personality traits and emotional factors cumulatively affect health outcomes.27 Findings from Chapter 2 show an association between dispositional pessimism and impaired mental- and physical health status at one year follow-up. In contrast to previous studies,28,29 pessimism was not associated with increased distress, possibly because of the relatively large sample size of the current study that provided the opportunity to statistically adjust for multiple impactful variables in the prediction models. 9174 175GENERAL DISCUSSION CHAPTER 9 The findings of Chapters 3 and 4 fit well in the overall tendency of existing literature to focus on negative correlates (e.g., depressive symptoms and Type D personality) with respect to health outcomes in patients with ICD, Chapter 2 sheds light on the importance of potential protective positive characteristics. Dispositional optimism was found to be associated with lower levels of distress and better mental health status one year post-implant. As optimism and pessimism are two distinct constructs that can coexist together ( Chapter 2 ), results from the first part of this dissertation accentuate the potential value of the enhancement of positive psychological states by short low- threshold interventions to possibly improve health outcomes within the ICD population. BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS, BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY, AND E-HEALTH IN PATIENTS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE The use and integration of behavioral interventions within eHealth programs is essential for intervention effectiveness,8,30 as evidence on stand-alone eHealth interventions on positive outcomes is lacking.31,32 Therefore, patients in the intervention group received the Do Something Different behavioral program33 (Chapter 4 \u2014 6 ). It was presumed that by enhancing one's behavioral flexibility via short messages that encourage to do something different from usual habits, people will be more prone and open to adopt healthier life style behavior.33 Previous evidence on behavioral flexibility showed small effects in weight loss,34 and therefore we expected beneficial effects in patients with CVD. In collaboration with cardiologists the Do's (behavioral prompts) that were used within Do CHANGE were adapted to the population with cardiovascular diseases (Chapter 4 ).35 The concept of behavioral flexibility has been applied to a diversity of separate behaviors in the literature, including impulse control and problem solving.36 This raises complications with regard to the comparability of the etiology of behavioral mechanisms behavioral flexibility refers to, leading to misconceptions regarding interpretation.36 Behavioral flexibility within the Do CHANGE trial was operationalized as the broadening of the behavioral repertoire across different situational contexts. The questionnaire used to assess behavioral flexibility contained 30 behaviors (e.g., predictable, definite), that could be coupled into 15 opposite pairs (e.g., predictable - unpredictable). Each additional behavior and each opposite pair selected raises the behavioral flexibility score. Thus, evidence on flexibility is abstracted from seemingly contradictory behaviors, as a person is able to use different reactions dependent on what a given situation demands ( Chapter 5 & Chapter 6 ). However, no significant effects of the Do CHANGE intervention on behavioral flexibility have been found ( Chapter 5 ). This could be explained by the fact that the questionnaire has not been validated and the reliability across different time points is questionable. Furthermore, this is the first time the questionnaire has been administered within the cardiac population, and the outcomes may reflect the need for further personalization of the Dos that were send to participating patients accordingly. As an extension to the latter explanation, the Dos were personalized based upon incoming sensory data (e.g., step count, GPS tracking) rather than patients' preferences. Hence, it is arguable that Dos make an appeal on behavior that is provoked by timing of a behavioral prompt rather than behavior that is initiated based upon underlying personal values. As self-determination and internal motivation are fundamental for sustained behavior change,37 the Dos not tapping into these domains fall short. Also, it is not clear whether or to what extent behavioral flexibility is operating as a moderating behavioral mechanism for improved healthy lifestyle behavior, in preference of an outcome measure. More research is warranted to establish the behavioral flexibility questionnaire as a valid and reliable tool for behavior change self-report assessment in patients with CVD. Self-monitoring as intervention component: blended-care Living with CVD involves the engagement in disease management strategies, including tracking of behavior and symptoms in order to effectively maintain health. Wearable trackers can be of help.38 Fox et al. (2013)39 described that of patients with one chronic illness, 40% tracked their symptoms. In patients with two or more chronic illnesses this percentage was 62%. These numbers suggest that the patient acceptance of self- monitoring devices in daily life is feasible. However, evidence on the implementation of these devices to serve secondary prevention in the cardiac population, in addition to existent clinical pathways was thus far inconclusive.40,41 Devices that were provided within the Do CHANGE interventions ( Chapter 5 & Chapter 6 ) were perceived as usable and were integrated relatively well in the patients' daily lives. Patients felt safer when healthcare professionals were watching along. Nonetheless, evidence on the effectiveness of stand-alone self-monitoring for sustainable behavior change is lacking. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Hannan et al. (2019)40 concluded that using wearable activity trackers in the maintenance phase of cardiac rehabilitation will primarily be beneficial in combination with exercise prescription or advise. Other studies also show that adherence to and effect of eHealth interventions is significantly enhanced by interpersonal communication (e.g., phone calls).42 In Chapter 8 , it was shown that objectively measured step count and physical activity levels increased at the start of the intervention, followed by a gradual decrease after three months. Amongst others, this finding could possibly be attributed to the weekly phone calls patients received for a short evaluation of their progression within the first three months of the 9176 177GENERAL DISCUSSION CHAPTER 9 intervention. This suggests that blended-care is the way forward in order to enhance intervention efficacy within patients with CVD.6 Identifying subgroups as part of personalized e-Health interventions Results presented in this dissertation highlight the relevance of personalization in the provision of eHealth interventions. Intervention usage highly depends on participants' socioeconomic (e.g., education)43 and individual (e.g., sex)44 characteristics, and it is for that reason advocated that personalization might enhance intervention effectiveness.32 Chapter 7 adds to the importance of taking into account the predictive value of clustering patient characteristics (including psychological ones) on aimed outcome measures. For example, elderly patients who were more likely to have CAD as primary diagnosis, show characteristics of a Type D personality, and have more comorbidities were reported lower scores on healthy lifestyle behavior. On the other hand, patients that were characterized by a younger age and Type D characteristics showed an increase in self-reported healthy lifestyle behavior. These findings might reveal patient information that is not well captured by a variable-centered approach which focuses on the average patient within a sample.45 It rather displays the effect of interrelated individual demographic, psychosocial, and clinical variables on outcome measures, which might provide opportunities for the development of targets for future personalized eHealth interventions. IMPLICATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE Ethical considerations The rapid evolvement of eHealth innovations within the medical field has led to new opportunities to enhance the quality of care and meet patients' needs to an extent that has not been possible with traditional treatments. Measurement of one's own bodily functions via wearables and apps has been perceived by patients as informative (Chapter 6 & Chapter 7 ), may provide insights into (behavioral) patterns, and contribute to more meaningful consultations with healthcare professionals.46 Nevertheless, concerns have been raised with regard to overly reliance on data47 and cardiologists.48 Monitoring of data might be experienced as burdensome, both by patients and healthcare professionals (e.g., feeling responsible).40 For example, research has demonstrated that information on illness might induce anxiety in patients with regard to common symptomatology (i.e., cyberchondria).47 This might specifically be apparent in patients who survived cardiac arrest, as they are more at risk for psychological trauma and cognitive impairments.49 Data provided to end-users should therefrom be meaningful (i.e., understandable, interpretable) and necessary (i.e., clinically relevant)40 in order to prevent information from being potentially harmful.50 In addition, it is advocated that prior to testing and developing technologies in a clinical setting, users' (e.g., patients) preferences and needs should be guiding.51 Unfortunately, concerns have been raised that eHealth interventions are commercially and technology driven,52 resulting in potential underrepresentation of patients' and cardiologists' opinions. For instance, focus groups carried out within the framework of Do CHANGE revealed that patients did not want to share their personal lifestyle data with healthcare professionals,53 while this was a substantial element of the intervention ( Chapter 5 ).35 With respect to data privacy, patients were overall not aware of where their personal (clinical and behavioral) data were stored and who had access to it.53 As the involvement of (commercial) third parties for technology development is inevitable, privacy of patients' data must be at the forefront. Moreover, risks of eHealth being disadvantageous regarding social (e.g., loss of connection patient and healthcare provider)52 and physical aspects (e.g., more medical mistakes, decreased quality of care) of cardiac care are mentioned.48 Cowie et al. (2016) mention that \" technology must support, and not destroy, person-centered care\".48 For that reason, taking into consideration patients' and healthcare professionals' preferences and needs is essential in the development and implementation of eHealth interventions in existing clinical practice and this user-centered approach is where technological innovation should start in future research. Person alized eHealth: treat everyone differently, but with the same intention Behavior change is complex, and is determined by various interacting and coexistent patient characteristics ( Chapter 6 & 7 ) on which could be intervened. Chapter 3 of this thesis showed that timing of an intervention is also of importance, as patients' needs and abilities for disease management may fluctuate following the diagnosis.18 In a qualitative metasynthesis, Schulman-Green et al. (2012)54 described that challenges in the management of a chronic illness are dynamic processes rather than stable outcomes. Based on patient experiences, three classifications of self-management processes were established: Focusing on illness needs , Activating resources , and Living with a chronic illness . Each of these processes is characterized by its own tasks and required skills, and relevance of each process to the patient may vary based on the trajectory and demands of the heart disease.54 Based on these processes, eHealth interventions may provide tailored support by incorporating well-established behavioral interventions that are able to target process-specific required skills for which individual help is needed (see Figure 1). Methods that enlarge factors of resilience in individual patients in combination with physical activity (e.g., acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT),55 yoga56) might be beneficial in this respect. This approach might enhance the 9178 179GENERAL DISCUSSION CHAPTER 9 patients' self-determination, self-efficacy, and autonomy, which potentially leads to improved disease management,57,58 better health outcomes,59 and increased quality of life.60 Future research should focus on personalization of eHealth interventions based upon the process of disease management patients find themselves in. This approach might provide insight into individual dependent mechanisms on which intervening with technological devices as means of additional support (i.e., blended-care) is possible and effective. Hypothetically, with precision medicine in mind, outcome measures of these interventions are dependent on individual characteristics as well. However, as all processes together tap into an overarching concept of well-being (e.g., quality of life), it might be persuasive to use this model as an outcome variable in future designs. FIGURE 1. Schematic overview of adapted self-management processes model. Implications build from this dissertation For future research, new methodologies for assessing effectiveness of offered eHealth interventions need to be considered. Due to the rapid development of soft- and hardware, the design of a randomized controlled trial is often not able to keep up and is untenable for answering research questions related to technological intervention efficacy.61 One example of new methodologies is the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework for improving behavioral interventions that are delivered with technologies on a systematic and accumulative basis.8 This approach is rooted in the RCT design, but enables researchers to examine independent and mixed effects of intervention components.8 Collaboration with methodologists and ethicists in the development of new interventions for patients with cardiovascular disease will be useful with regard to the marshalling of research questions. The most effective dose- response relationship between the provision of specific intervention components in order to achieve positive cardiac outcomes has to be assessed in future research. In addition, interventions should be evaluated and developed in a systematic manner before being implemented into clinical practice. One way for doing this is by using the Model for Assessment of Telemedicine (MAST),62 which takes into account both patients' and healthcare providers' perspective in providing evidence for a certain eHealth intervention.62 For clinical practice, being alert for mental problems (e.g., depression) is to be advised. Psychological distress in CVD patients is prevalent,63 and the existence of health risk behavior might possibly be a way of coping, or consequence of underlying psychological difficulties.6 Providing psychological help by referring patients to a medical psychologist is of priority. With regard to behavior change, it is of importance to define clear, reachable goals and expectations with regard to illness management for individual patients.64 Targets defined in clinical cardiac guidelines are for some patients not achievable, which might result in increased distress and feelings of failure.6 Small improvements should be celebrated,64 as a small reduction in health risk behavior already positively influences cardiac prognosis65 and suitable reinforcement enlarges patients' engagement in his/her own care plan.64 Implementation of eHealth into clinical practice Implementation of effective technological interventions into clinical practice is challenging, and the translation of controlled interventions to 'the real world' often results in dissimilar outcomes.66 Th e Do C HAN G E tri a l w a s e m bed d ed q u it e w e l l within the existing cardiac clinical practice. However, for technological innovations to be part of existing clinical pathways, healthcare professionals specialized in eHealth should be affiliated to provide (technological)support to patients, relatives, and other care providers.67 Furthermore, devices that deliver mobile health often consist of a combination of hardware (e.g., activity tracker) and software (e.g., algorithms for the management of physical activity).67 Certification may be needed in order to safely use such technologies in clinical practice, which requires a new regulatory approach based upon the dynamic nature of software updates coming with these devices.67 9180 181GENERAL DISCUSSION CHAPTER 9 These aspects require a complete and profound shift in healthcare delivery as a consequence, both for patients and healthcare providers. Furthermore, reorganization of care processes in hospitals is required, and new ways of reimbursement by healthcare insurers need to be realized before implementation of personalized eHealth interventions can adequately be established.68 CONCLUDING REMARKS Based on the current dissertation, it is fair to conclude that personalization of eHealth interventions for secondary prevention in patients with cardiac diseases is in its infancy. We gained more insight into specific patient characteristics that could influence health related outcomes. Based on current knowledge a new approach focusing on patients' strengths (increasing optimism) might be the way forward to improve health outcomes. The interventions presented in this thesis are feasible, however, the potential effectivity of using technological tools appears to be highly dependent on its aimed goals, timing, and coexistent interrelated individual patient characteristics. It is advocated that clinicians, policy makers, and future research projects take into account patients' preferences, needs, and expectations when considering technological devices as part of secondary prevention.REFERENCES 1.
