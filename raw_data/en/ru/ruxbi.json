This year, in particular, it's critical to ensure that families stay on track for children's routine checkups and recommended vaccinations - while we navigate the after effects of the COVID -19 pandemic . A CDC report released in May 2020 found a troubling drop in routine childhood vaccination as a result of families staying at home due to COVID . CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that children stay on track with their well -child appointments and routine vaccinations even during the pandemic. As in - person learning and play become more common, on -time vaccination is even more urgent to help provide immunity against 14 serious diseases. NIIW 202 2 is Apri l 24 - 30, 202 2 2022 VFC RE -ENROLLMENT Annual re -enrollment for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program will be open from April 15, 2022 - May 31, 2022 . Additional details and instructions will be shared in the upcoming weeks . 2022 YOU CALL THE SHOTS MODULES You Call the Shots training modules for 2022 are available. This CDC training includes two mandatory modules, hosted on the CDC's Training and Continuing Education Online (TCEO) page. Other non -mandatory modules are included, and we encourage reviewing them as well. Each 'You Call the Shots' module can be accessed directly on its corresponding TCEO page: You Call the Shots - Module Ten - Storage and Handling - 2022 (Web -based) You Call the Shots - Module Sixteen - Vaccines for Children Program - 2022 (Web -based) For further information, or for help accessing the training, please visit the main TCEO training page . All primary and back -up vaccine coordinators must complete both mandatory training modules as a requirement to re -enroll with the VFC Program. Please continue to hold off on sending t raining certificates to the Division of Immunizations. Certificates will be required at re -enrollment and must be submitted with the VFC re -enrollment provider profile. INFLUENZA VACCINE Influenza vaccine for this season is still available. Providers in need of influenza vaccine should place their orders in PA-SIIS utilizing the standard vaccine ordering process. Notification will come when flu vaccine is turned off in SIIS.

In this edition, we will be discussing meningococcal disease, along with some resources providers can use to discuss the importance of vaccinating adults at risk for this highly contagious, and potentially fatal, disease. The most common causes of meningitis are viral and bacterial infections (and rarely fungal or parasitic infections). For the purpose of vaccination, we will be focusin g on bacterial meningitis, and the vaccines that help prevent infection in your patients. Meningitis is the inflammation of the tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord : the meninges. Although it often begins with symptoms that resemble influenza or a cold, bacterial meningitis can quickly become serious, even deadly. Anyone can get bacterial meningitis, but the disease is more common in children, teenagers, and those patients with weakened immune systems. Transmission takes place by direct contact with respiratory secretions or by inhaling large droplets, with the bacteria capable of surviving for hours on some surfaces. Of the five groups that commonly cause the disease (A, C, W, Y, B), three cause most of the disease seen in the United St ates : B, C, and Y. Mortality rates for bacterial meningitis are estimated at one in 10 cases, while those who recover often deal with lifelong disabilities such as brain damage or deafness. SYMPTOMS Although symptoms may vary for each individual, those typically associated with meningitis are a sudden high fever, severe headache, and a stiff neck. Symptoms can develop over several hours or a few days, with most patients showing signs of infection within 3 to 7 days. Pennsylvania Immunization Program Newsletter March/April 2022 Division of Immunizations | Room 1026 H&W Building 625 Forster Street | Harrisburg, PA 17120 -0701 4 COMPLICATIONS Even with prompt medical attention, meningitis can kill 10% to 15% of those infected. Those patients who survive the disease often face serious and lifelong complications. Some of the devastating outcomes for these patients will involve: Hearing loss Kidney failure Nervous system problems Limb amputation/digit loss Vision loss in one or both eyes ADULT POPULATIONS MOST AT RISK Those in group settings: College students living in dormitories/shared facilities , prison facilities , military accommodations. Certain medical issues : HIV infection, asplenia, weakened immune systems. According to current evidence, individuals with Sickle cell anemia have more th an 300 times greater risk to develop bacterial meningitis (BM) than the general population. There are three primary pathogens responsible for this higher risk: H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and N. meningitides . Age: Older adults are at increased risk for many pathogens that cause meningitis, including N. meningitides. Travelers: Travelers may be at increased risk for meningococcal disease, caused by N. meningitidis, if they travel to certain places. Two areas to not e: the meningitis belt in sub -Saharan Africa, particularly during the dry season; Mecca during the annual Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage. Lab workers or caregivers: Those who work with meningococcal bacteria in a lab setting, or who may be exposed to the diseas e while providing care. Pay attention to teenagers and young adults not vaccinated for Meningitis B. Meningitis B vaccine was not available until late in 2014. According to CDC data from 2015 - 2017, more than 60% of meningitis cases in 16 through 23-year -olds were caused by Meningitis B. Teens and young adults (16 through 23 years old) also may receive a MenB vaccine, to help protect against most strains of meningitis B. MENNINGOCOCCAL VACCIN ES There are two vaccines that help protect against the f ive serogroups that are most common in meningococcal and young adults (16 -23 years old ) also may get a MenB vaccine, based on discussions between the patient (and parent, where applicable) and health care provider. MenB vaccines: Bexsero and Trumenb a Pennsylvania Immunization Program 2022 Division of Immunizations | Room 1026 H&W Building 625 Forster Street | Harrisburg, PA 17120 -0701 5 MenACWY recommended schedule: Dose one - all preteens 11 -12 years of age Booster dose - all teens 16 years of age Persons who receive dose one at or after the 16th birthday do not need a booster . The preferred age for MenB Vaccination is 16 -18 years of age Multiple doses are needed for best protection All doses must be the same brand For more information, please visit CDC's pink book chapter on Meningococcal Disease .

The National Academy of Medicine, formerly known as Institute of Medicine (IOM), reviewed the safety of ei ght vaccines to children and adults. The review found that with rare exceptions, these vaccines are safe. Source: Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence an d Causality [Institute of Medicine. 2012] In the biggest and most recent study, Danish researchers followed over 657,000 children born over the course of 11 years. Researchers compared children who received MMR vaccine with those who hadn't. They found no link between MMR and autism, even in chil dren with risk factors like a family history of autism. Source: Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccination: A Nationwide Cohort Study. https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18 -2101 A CDC study published in 2013 added to the research showing that vaccines do not cause ASD. The study focused on the number of antigens given during the first two years of life. Antigens are substances in vaccines that cause the body's immune system to produce disease -fighting antibodies. The results showed that the total amount of antigen from vaccines received was the same between children with ASD and those that did not have A SD. Source: Increasing exposure to antibody -stimulating proteins and polysaccharides in vaccines is not associated with risk of autism [ J Pediatr. 2013] One vaccine ingredient that has been studie d specifically is thimerosal. Thimerosal is a mercury -based preservative used to prevent germs (like bacteria and fungi) from contaminating multidose vials of vaccines. Research shows that thimerosal does not cause ASD. In fact, a 2004 scientific review by the IOM concluded that \"the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal -containing vaccines and autism. \" Source: Immunization Safety Review: Vaccines and Autism [ The National Academies Press. 2004] Since 2003, there have been nine CDC -funded or conducted studies that have found no link between thimerosal - containing vaccines and ASD. These studies also found no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and ASD in children. Learn mor e about the CDC Studies on Thimerosal in Vaccines pdf icon [PDF - 2 pages] . Even before studies showed that thimerosal was not harmful, there was a national effort to reduce all types of mercury exposures in children. As precaution, thimerosal was removed or reduced to trace amounts in all childhood vaccines between 1999 and 2001 . Currently, the only type of vaccine that contain thimerosal are flu vaccines packaged in multidose vials. There are thimerosal -free alternatives available for flu vaccine. For more information, see the Timeline for Thimerosal in Vaccines . Besides thimerosal, some people have had concerns about other vaccine ingredients in relation to ASD. However, no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and ASD.

These visits are conducted by the DOH COVID -19 Vaccination Program. They are essential to determine if providers have a clear understanding of the COVID - 19 vaccination program requirements. Site visits are a key opportunity to further develop and strengthen relationships with enrolled providers. Site visits will assess C OVID -19 vaccination provider adherence to program requirements and recommendations, identify and address areas where providers are doing well, identify and address the educational needs of COVID -19 vaccination providers to help meet program requirements, a nd ensure that providers understand proper storage and handling requirements. DOH staff are available to support enrolled COVID -19 vaccination providers, provide technical assistance when needed, and provide resources to assist with accurate vaccine manag ement and administration. Providers will be contacted by e-mail or phone by DOH field staff to schedule site visits . CDC'S UPDATED INTERIM CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR COVID -19 VACCINATION Recently, the CDC updated its interim clinical considerations to reflect the following changes . In the case of moderately or severely immunocompromised patients : Those individuals who have completed the primary series of an mRNA vaccine (from Pfizer -BioNTech or Moderna) should receive a booster dose of mRNA after three months (instead of five months after the last primary dose). Those who have received a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID -19 vaccine should receive an additional dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine and a booster dose (preferably mRNA) for a total of three doses of vaccine. A clarification regarding a current recommendation to confirm that those who ha ve completed their three mRNA vaccine doses should receive a booster dose of the mRNA vaccine -for a total of four doses. In the case of individuals who have received passive COVID -19 antibodies in the past : The existing guidance has been simplified in that they do not need to wait any period before receiving the COVID -19 vaccine. Updated guidance regarding receiving a booster dose if previously vaccinated outside the United States. Updated contraindication and precaution section to include history of myocarditis or pericarditis after an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine as a precaution. In the case of those who receive the m -RNA COVID -19 vaccine : Considerations have been added for an 8 -week interval between the first and second doses of an init ial mRNA vaccination schedule for some individuals aged 12 years and older, particularly for males aged 12 to 39 years. Pennsylvania Immunization Program Newsletter March/April 2022 Division of Immunizations | Room 1026 H&W Building 625 Forster Street | Harrisburg, PA 17120 -0701 8 BEST PRACTICE REFRESHER THE GRACE PERIOD ACIP recommends that vaccine doses given up to four days before the minimum interval or age be counted as valid . It should not be used for scheduling future vaccination visits . It can be used for reviewing vaccination records . Use of the \"Grace Period\" 1. To schedule a future appointment - No 2. When evaluating a vaccination record - Yes 3. Client is in the office or clinic early - Maybe Client/parent is known and dependable - Reschedule Client/parent is unknown or undependable - Vaccinate Basic principles The recommended interval or age is preferred. The minimum interval can be used to catch up. The grace period is last resort . KNOW YOUR NURSE!
