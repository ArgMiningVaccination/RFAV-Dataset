While the use of complementary, alternative and integrative medicine (CAIM) is substantial, it continues to exist at the periphery of allopathic medicine. Understanding the attitudes of medical students toward CAIM will be useful in understanding futureintegration of CAIM and allopathic medicine. This study was conducted to develop and evaluate an instrument and assess medical students' attitudes toward CAIM. The Complementary, Alternative and Integrative Medicine Attitudes Questionnaire (CAIMAQ) was developed by a panel of experts in CAIM, allopathic medicine, medical education and survey development. A total of 1770CAIMAQ surveys (51% of US medical schools participated) were obtained in a national sample of medical students in 2007. Factor analysis of the CAIMAQ revealed ve distinct attitudinal domains: desirability of CAIM therapies, progressive patient/physician health care roles, mind-body-spirit connection, principles of allostasis and a holistic understanding of disease. The students heldthe most positive attitude for the \"mind-body-spirit connection\" and the least positive for the \"desirability of CAIM therapies\" .This study provided initial support for the reliability of the CAIMAQ. The survey results indicated that in general students responded more positively to the principles of CAIM than to CAIM treatment. A higher quality of CAIM-related medical education and expanded research into CAIM therapies would facilitate appropriate integration of CAIM into medical curricula. The mostsignicant limitation of this study is a low response rate, and further work is required to assess more representative populations in order to determine whether the relationships found in this study are generalizable. 1. Introduction 1.1. Complementary and Alternative Medicine. The term complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) describesa group of health care systems, practices and products notpresently considered to be part of allopathic medicine [ 1]. While systems of CAM (such as chiropractic, ayurveda,homeopathy and naturopathy) display considerable diversity,they share many of the same core values [ 2]. CAM systemsare characterized by a holistic and highly individualized approach to patient care, an emphasis on maximizing thebody's inherent healing ability, involving patients as activeparticipants in their own care, addressing physical, mentaland spiritual attributes of a disease, and placing a strongemphasis on preventative medicine [ 2-7]. 1.2. The Use of CAM in the USA Is Substantial. Ar e c e n ts t u d y of CAM use in the general population reported that in 20072 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine almost 4 out of 10 adults had used some form of CAM within the past year [ 1]. In 1998, it was estimated the US public spent between $36 and $47 billion on CAM therapies,with $12-$20 billion of that total spent out-of-pocket for professional CAM services. (This was more than the out-of-pocket fees for all hospitalizations in that year, and about half the amount paid for all out-of-pocket physician services) [ 3]. 1.3. Integrative Medicine. Integrative medicine incorporates aspects of both CAM and allopathic medicine; generallyit combines allopathic medical therapies with those high-quality scientic evidence of safetyand e ectiveness [ 1]. However, like CAM, the practice of integrative medicine is diverse. Specic techniques of CAMcan be integrated into a disease-centered model; for example,an orthopedic surgeon may use acupuncture locally toreduce inflammation. This model of integration has resultedin some CAM techniques becoming mainstream, such aspatient support groups [ 1]. Beyond a piecemeal absorption of CAM modalities into an allopathic model of medicine, integrative medicine mayprovide a new paradigm that incorporates core CAM values[2]. For example, integrative medicine may be characterized by a humanistic, relationship-centered partnership approachto care, a focus on biological, psychological, social andspiritual influences to pathology, and an emphasis onproviding hope, education and therapeutic approaches that match an individual's worldview [ 2]. 1.4. Medical Student Attitudes. The extent to which integra- tion between CAM and allopathic medicine will occur inthe future, as well as the nature of this integration, willbe greatly influenced by the attitudes of physicians [ 8]. However, most physicians know little about CAM [ 9,10]. Investigating medical student attitudes toward CAM is,therefore, important in assessing the possibility that thismay change. Student attitudes and beliefs may have a strongimpact on the way medical students ultimately practicemedicine [ 11]. In previous studies, medical students have consistently expressed interest in gaining more exposure toCAM [ 12,13], and medical schools are becoming aware of the need to provide CAM-related education [ 9]. Most US medical schools now o er coursework addressing CAM [14]. Investigating medical student attitudes toward CAM is also important because in view of the high use ofCAM integrative medicine may become a major feature ofmainstream health care [ 8]. This study measures attitudes not only toward CAM, but also toward integrative medicine. CAIM directly involves medical doctors in bridging the gap between allopathic medicine and CAM. 1.5. Prior Studies of Medical Student Attitudes toward CAIM. A comprehensive literature review was performed in order toidentify prior surveys investigating attitudes, and specicallymedical student attitudes, toward CAIM. These earlierstudies were generally performed at single sites using self-developed instruments and did not report information aboutthe reliability and validity of the measures [ 6,13,15-27].The 29-item Integrative Medicine Attitudes Question- naire (IMAQ), developed at the University of Arizona,was the rst such instrument evaluated for psychometricproperties [ 28]. Analyses of the 196 completed IMAQ surveys revealed two underlying domains: (i) openness to new ideasand paradigms and (ii) value of both introspection and relationship to patient. A second study using the same instrument with 272 US medical students yielded an internalconsistency reliability of 0.83 for a scale formed from allthe IMAQ items [ 6]. These studies were later criticized for assuming, by using orthogonal rotation, that the factorswere not correlated with each other. In addition, the twofactors only explained 38% of the variance in responses [ 29]. Portions of the IMAQ were also used in a survey of medicalstudents at UCLA [ 30]. A modied version of the IMAQ was developed for a six-school, international study of 604 rst-year medicalstudents [ 29]. A conrmatory factor analysis revealed three distinct scales: (i) attitudes toward holism, (ii) attitudestoward the e ectiveness of CAM and (iii) attitudes toward introspection and doctor-patient relationship. However, theinternal consistency reliability coe cients and the t indices (e.g., CFI =0.887, SRMR =0.0632) for the three-factor model were unimpressive. 1.6. Study Objectives. The purpose of this research was to develop and evaluate a new instrument to assess attitudestoward CAM among US medical students. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Approval. The protocol and informed consent forms were reviewed and approved by the InstitutionalReview Board (IRB approval #060557) at the University ofCalifornia at San Diego (UCSD) for 2006-08. 2.2. Instrument Development. T o develop the Complemen- tary, Alternative, and Integrative Medicine Attitude Ques-tionnaire (CAIMAQ) (the appendix), a group was formed consisting of academic clinicians, researchers and students from schools of medicine, public health and traditional ori-ental medicine having expertise in CAIM, allopathic medi-cine, medical education and survey development. Based on a review of the literature, as well as personal, clinical and professional expertise, the core CAIM valueschosen to be evaluated were: (i) A holistic and individualized approach to patient care. (ii) Belief in the innate healing ability of the body. (iii) End-of-life care as an opportunity for healing. (iv) Belief in a spiritual aspect of illness. (v) Importance of involving patients as active partici- pants in treatment. (vi) Provision of hope to patients. (vii) Humanistic, relationship centered patient-physician interactions.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 (viii) Signicance of physician well-being and modeling of healthy lifestyles for patients. (ix) Synergy between CAM and allopathic medicine. (x) Sources of evidence other than biomedical research. (xi) Importance of basic knowledge for physicians regard- ing CAM therapies. (xii) Strong emphasis on preventive medicine. (xiii) Focus on health and well-being as distinct from the absence of disease. (xiv) Generally low-invasive nature of treatment. Items were based on those in the IMAQ, as well as others generated de novo or adapted from other instruments, to better represent the core values listed above. Despite the factthat both positive and negative items are frequently used insurvey instruments, it is known that combining these itemssuppresses score reliability [ 31,32]. Thus, all the items in this study were positively worded. The CAM categories used by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) wereused to measure attitudes toward specic CAM modali-ties. Previous instruments used these categories to eval-uate attitudes toward specic CAM modalities [ 33,34]. NCCAM categories: wholemedical systems (e.g., homeopathic medicine, naturopathicmedicine, traditional Chinese medicine, ayurveda), mind-body medicine (e.g., meditation, prayer, art, music, dance),biologically based practices (e.g., dietary supplements, herbalproducts), manipulative and body-based practices (e.g.,chiropractic manipulation, massage) and energy medicine(including both bioeld therapies (e.g., Tai Chi, Qi Gong,Reiki, Therapeutic T ouch) and bioelectromagnetic-basedtherapies (e.g., the medical terms adapted from the NCCAM web site was included with the survey to aid participants who wereunfamiliar with the terms used. The CAIMAQ included 30 items. Each item was admin- istered using a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from one(strongly disagree) to seven (strongly agree). A \"don'tknow\" option was also explicitly provided and treated asmissing data. Following the 30-item CAIMAQ, demographicinformation was collected on gender, age, race/ethnicity(according to the format recommended by the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH) [ 35]), year in medical school, medical school attended, CAM-related medical educationand prior exposure to CAM. At the end of the survey,participants were given the opportunity to provide open-ended comments. An online web version of the CAIMAQwas created for this study using SurveyMonkey. 2.3. Pilot Study. The CAIMAQ was administered to a group of 56 second-year medical students at the UCSD School ofMedicine. Comments were elicited from participants and thedata from this administration were analyzed to determineif revisions to the protocol or items were needed beforeproceeding with national distribution. Some items wererevised given the feedback from the pilot study sample that claried item wording, amended terms in the glossary,eliminated items from the demographic information sectionand reduced response burden. In addition, the pilot studyresults were used to hypothesize a potential solution forsubsequent conrmatory factor analyses. 2.4. National Field Test. A letter introducing the survey was sent electronically to every medical school in theUSA in 2007. Specically, the letter was sent to the Deanof Student A airs (or equivalent position), the Ameri- can Medical Student Association (AMSA) o cer and the Association of American Medical Colleges Organization ofStudent Representatives (AAMC OSR) o cer at each school. These recipients were then asked to forward an attachedelectronic recruitment letter to active medical students attheir institutions. The electronic recruitment letter containeda link to access the CAIMAQ online. As an incentive forparticipation, six MP3 players were given at random toparticipants who completed the survey. Prior to taking the survey, participants were provided with an informed consent and subject's bill of rights. For asurvey to be accepted, participants were required to answerall 30 items of the CAIMAQ and the question \"Are you currently a medical student in the USA?\" Only the rst survey per web address was allowed. 3. Results 3.1. Response Rate. A total of 1784 completed surveys were obtained from the total population of 68 001 US medicalstudents [ 36]. Responses were excluded if participants failed to armatively answer that they were current US medical students (eight excluded) or if they answered that theyattended either a school of osteopathy or a foreign medicalschool (six excluded). Thus, a total of 1770 responses wereincluded in the nal analysis (3% of the US medical studentpopulation). Respondents participated from 64 of the 126medical schools solicited (51%), and participation at eachschool ranged from 1 to 164. The survey was distributed andthe rst response collected on April 12, 2007. The survey wasclosed to further responses and the nal response collectedon July 3, 2007. Because of the manner in which the paper was dis- tributed, it is impossible to know the exact response rate.While 51% of medical schools forwarded the electronicrecruitment letter to medical students at their institutions,distribution was heterogeneous. Some schools forwardedthe electronic recruitment letter individually to studentsas requested, while other schools posted the recruitmentletter on a medical student forum, or in some cases only distributed the survey to a portion of the student body. Consistent information regarding how many studentsreceived the recruitment letter was not reported. 3.2. Study Population: Demographic and Comparison. Com- pared to the entire population of US medical stu-dents, the CAIMAQ survey population had more females4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine (57 versus 50%) and was more likely to self-identify as white (75 versus 69%) [ 36,37]. The reported average age of students who participated in the CAIMAQ survey was 26years; the national average age of students entering medicalschool is 24 years (84% of students report graduation in 4years, 10% in 5 years [ 38]) (Table 1 ). Because the CAIMAQ population consisted of students in all years of medical school, the reported age is consistent with the expectationthat respondents completing the CAIMAQ would be 2 years older than matriculate age on average. Of therespondents who elected to report their year in school ( n = 1728), 521 were rst-year medical students (29%), 483 were second-year medical students (27%), 409 were third-yearmedical students (23%) and 315 were fourth-year Student Attitudes toward CAIM. CAIMAQ res- pondents expressed a wide range of attitudes toward CAIM,from skepticism to enthusiasm ( Table 2 ). On the whole, however, respondents endorsed the importance of CAIM.Seventy-seven percent of participants agreed to some extentthat patients whose doctors know about CAM, in addi-tion to conventional medicine, benet more than thosewhose doctors are only familiar with conventional medicine.Seventy-four percent of participants agreed to some extentthat a system of medicine that integrates therapies of bothconventional medicine and CAM would be more e ec- tive than either conventional medicine or CAM providedindependently. Eighty-four percent agreed to some extentthat CAM contains beliefs, ideas and therapies from whichconventional medicine could benet. In addition, participants generally expressed positive attitudes toward many of the core principles queried by theCAIMAQ items. Nearly every participant, 99%, agreed tosome extent that a patient's mental state influences his or herphysical health, and 98% agreed that a patient's treatmentshould take into consideration all aspects of his or herphysical, mental and spiritual health. Eighty-six percent of participants agreed to some extent that doctors who lead balanced lifestyles generate improved patient satisfaction,and 81% agreed that doctors who model a healthy lifestylegenerate improved patient outcomes. Eighty percent ofrespondents agreed to some extent that the focus of aprimary care physician should be on promoting health ratherthan treating disease. 3.4. Conrmatory Factor Analysis. Conrmatory factor anal- ysis (CFA) was performed in order to evaluate how itemsgrouped together empirically. We hypothesized ap r i o r i a three-factor model and an alternative four-factor modelbased on the results of the IMAQ studies and the pilotstudy. Data were initially screened in SPSS v. 15.0.1 andthen transferred as a tab-delimited le to PRELIS v. 2.54, thepreprocessor for LISREL v.8.54, to be used for the CFA [ 39] and SIMPLIS [ 40]. The total sample size for this study was n =1770. However, the response \"don't know\" was treated as missingdata; had participant responses with missing data beenexcluded, it would have resulted in a 40% loss of cases and produced an analyzable sample size of n =1062. The missing data across items ranged from 1 (Item 1: \"A patient'streatment should take into consideration all aspects of his orher physical, mental, and spiritual health\") to 355 (Item 28:\"Therapeutic T ouch is credible as a form of treatment\"). As the response \"don't know\" is a legitimate response that does not indicate a positive, negative or neutral attitude to an item,the most reasonable methodological approach was to llthese on the basis of existing data using multiple imputation(MI) [ 41]. The CFA indicated a slightly better t for the four-factor structure, though less than adequate t was evidenced by theglobal (e.g., SRMR), exact (signicant chi-square) and and identication, results from prelimi-nary analysis, parameter estimation, assessment of model t,and full interpretation of the results may be accessed onlineat www.cewm.med.ucla.edu/research/CAIMAQ data.html. 3.5. Exploratory Factor Analysis. Given the less-than-optimal t of the hypothesized models, we performed exploratoryfactor analysis (EFA) using principal components extractionand Promax rotation. The rotated pattern matrix (using theKaiser Criterion >1.0 cuto for factor retention) revealed a ve-component solution that explained 51% of the varianceand resulted in nine communalities ( h 2)<0.45. These ve factors accounted for the majority of variance; a sixth factorwas not substantially meaningful. Promax rotation was usedbecause it utilizes an orthogonal and then oblique rotation[41]. A very similar factorial solution emerged regardless of the type of rotation (orthogonal versus oblique) or extraction(principal components versus principal axis factoring), aswell as when varying the power of kf r o mt w ot os i x .T h e Promax rotation ( k =4) revealed ve scales (eigenvalues and percent of variance in parenthesis) that appear to representattitudes toward (i) the desirability of CAIM therapies(9.693, 32%), (ii) patient/physician (iii) the mind-body-spirit of allostasis understanding of disease (1.041, 3%) ( Figure 1 ). Additional information regarding the EFA is available onlineat www.cewm.med.ucla.edu/research/CAIMAQ data.html. 3.6. CAIMAQ Scales. Scale scores were created by averaging responses to the items in each scale. Figure 1 shows that the most positive attitude (mean \u00b1SD) was obtained for \"attitudes toward the mind-body-spirit connection\" (6.11 \u00b1 0.76) therapies\" (4.69 \u00b11.01). Participant attitudes were signicantly more positive for factors that queriedfoundational values of CAIM, such as the mind-body-spirit connection, a holistic understanding of disease andprogressive patient/physician health care roles than for thedesirability of CAIM therapies. These data seem to supportthe idea that students are comfortable with the principlesof CAIM but may be hesitant to actually endorse providingCAIM.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 Table 1: Demographic characteristics of respondents to the CAIMAQa.

The relative lack of support for CAIM therapies may be due to, in the words of one participant, a \"lack of evidencebase for CAM\" . Comments of this nature were the mostfrequent in the survey. As another participant stated, \"Ifeel that the biggest ...division between alternative medicine and allopathic medicine is ...evidence\" . While 79% of the respondents agreed to some extent that \"therapies lackingrigorous support from biomedical research may neverthelessbe of value to doctors\" , the most frequent reason given byphysicians for not accepting the use of CAIM is that CAIMtherapies are perceived as lacking rigorous scientic support[42,43].3.7. Y ear Level for CAIMAQ Subscales. In order to determine whether participant year in medical school was relatedto CAIMAQ responses, a one-way analysis of variance(ANOV A) was conducted for each of the CAIMAQ subscalesto compare them with participant year in medical school.The analysis did not reveal a signicant relationship betweenrespondent year in school (MS-I to MS-IV) and any of theCAIMAQ subscales. 3.8. Adequacy of CAM-Related Education. Following the CAIMAQ items, participants were asked to respond to anumber of questions regarding demographic information,6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 2: Summary of CAIMAQ items and exploratory factor analysis ( n=1770 all items). Factor 1. Attitudes toward the desirability of CAIM therapies (=0.90) Item 3: Patients whose doctors know about complementary and alt ernative medicine, in addition to conventional medicine, benet more than those whose doctors are only familiar with conventional medicine. Item 4: When systems of alternative medicine (such as traditional Chinese medicine) are found to be e cacious in treatment of a disease, doctors should recommend them even though these systems may rely on unknown mechanisms. Item 6: Therapies lacking rigorous support from biomedical research (randomized controlled trials, etc.) may nevertheless be of value to doctors. Item 8: A system of medicine that integrates therapies of both conventional medicine and complementary and alternative medicine would be more e ective than either conventional medicine or complement ary and alternative medicine provided independently. Item 10: The use of herbal products represents a legitimate form of medicine that can treat a wide variety of disease.Item 15: Complementary and alternative medicine contains beliefs, ideas and therapies from which conventional medicine could benet.Item 16: Chiropractic care can be a valuable method for resolving a wide variety of musculoskeletal problems. Item 18: Massage therapy can lead to objective improvements in long-term outcomes for patients. Item 25: Doctors should consider referring patients to alternative health care providers such as homeopaths or naturopaths for conditions poorly managed by conventional medicine. Item 27: It is ethical for doctors to recommend therapies to patients that involve the use of subtle energy elds in and around the body for medical purposes. Item 28: Therapeutic T ouch is credible as a form of treatment. Item 30: Treatments of complementary and alternative medicine tend to be less invasive that those of conventional medicine, and may help to reduce the risk of side e ects and iatrogenesis. Factor 2. Attitudes toward progressive patient/physician health care roles (=0.79) Item 13: Patients who express themselves through creative outlets such as art, music or dance may achieve signicant health benets through these activities. Item 14: Doctors who lead a balanced lifestyle (i.e., attending to their own health, social, family and spiritual needs, as well as interests beyond medicine) generate improved patient satisfaction. Item 20: A strong relationship between patients and their doctors is a v aluable therapeutic intervention that leads to improved outcomes. Item 21: Doctors who model a healthy lifestyle (i.e., follow their own advice) generate improved patient outcomes.Item 22: Whenever reasonable, a physician should provide patients with hope and a positive attitude toward healing. Item 23: A patient who is an active participant in his or her care is likely to experience improved outcomes compared with a patient who is a passive participant. Item 24: Nutritional counseling and dietary/food supplements can be e ective in the treatment of pathology. Factor 3. Attitudes toward the mind-body-spirit connection (=0.70) Item 1: A patient's treatment should take into consideration al l aspects of his or her physical, mental and spiritual health. Item 5: Prayer, for oneself or others, can benet quality of life and disease outcomes. Item 7: The spiritual beliefs of patients play an important role in their recovery.Item 11: A patient's mental state influences his or her physical health. Factor 4. Attitudes toward the principles of allostasis (=0.50) Item 2: The focus of a primary care physician should be on promoting health rather than treating disease.Item 12: Disease occurs when the body's innate ability to heal itself becomes compromised.Item 19: The innate self-healing capacity of patients often determines the outcome of illness regardless of treatment interventions. Factor 5. Attitudes toward a holistic understanding of disease (=0.66) Item 9: End-of-life care should be valued as an opportunity for patients to heal. Item 17: A patient with a terminal illness can experience mental and spiritual healing in being at peace with himself or herself. Item 26: Even in the absence of clinically signicant disease, a person can experience a vast range in terms of physical health.Item 29: Disease can be viewed as an opportunity for personal change and growth. CAM-related medical education and personal CAM use, including the query, \"Do you feel that the education you havereceived regarding complementary and alternative medicineas part of your medical education has been adequate?\" Ofthe respondents who answered this question ( n =1720), 39% reported that their CAM-related medical education wasadequate.In order to determine whether participant year in school was related to the reported adequacy of CAM-related medicaleducation, a chi-square analysis was conducted. The resultsof the analysis suggest that students are more likely to reporttheir CAM-related education adequate further P=.024, Cramer's V= 0.074). This relationship illustrated in Figure 2 .O fn o t eEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 MS IV MS III MS II MS I Ye a r i n s ch o o l Education not adequate Education adequate05101520253035Percent Figure 2: Respondent year in school by perceived adequacy of CAM-related medical education. is the relatively high rate of \"no\" responses for rst-year medical students compared to those in other years. 3.9. Personal Use of CAM. A signicant percentage of survey respondents reported personal experience with CAM. Forty-nine percent answered that they had treated themselveswith CAM, 38% reported having received treatment froma CAM provider (an acupuncturist, chiropractor, etc.) and14% reported having treated someone else with CAM. The10 most commonly used CAM therapies during the pastyear were massage (35%), deep breathing exercises (32%),prayer for health reasons (29%), yoga meditation(25%), non-vitamin, non-mineral, natural products (10%). Commentssuggest that personal use of CAM was a factor in respondentattitudes, consistent with other research in this area [ 44]. Some participants also stated that they had a di erent standard for personal CAM use than for recommendingCAM to patients. 4. Conclusion 4.1. Study Limitations. The most signicant limitation of this study is a low response rate, and further work is required to assess more representative populations in order to determine if the relationships found in this study are generalizable.Although the response rate to the CAIMAQ is within therange of response rates for internet surveys [ 45], the study participants may not be representative of the underlyingpopulation. It is possible that the students in the CAIMAQsurvey population had more positive, negative or extremeattitudes toward CAIM than students who chose not toparticipate. Care needs to be exercised in the interpretationof these preliminary results. The similarity between the demographic information of participants and the general population of medical studentsis somewhat reassuring. In 51% of medical schools thatforwarded the survey, distribution was heterogeneous, and the entire medical student body was unlikely to receive thedistribution email. This probably accounted for the higherparticipation rate at schools such as UCSD, where the facultyand administration endorsed and repeatedly encouragedstudents to take the survey. At other institutions the survey received no o cial support. According to anecdotal partic- ipant reports, the lack of response may have been due tothe distribution method, rather than existing attitudes tothe subject matter. In the future, more focused distributionto schools that agree to proactively administer the surveyto students should be performed to improve response rate.In addition, greater compensation for participation wouldlikely improve the response rate. Some of the core CAIM values and CAIMAQ subscales embody principles that are acknowledged by many con-ventional medical practitioners and educators as crucial tothe practice of e ective allopathic care. For example, it has been argued that the whole-person approach is simply goodmedicine, and that a holistic approach to patient care is notthe sole domain of CAIM [ 46]. It is true that a purely allopathic provider may practice a patient-centered, holistic model of health care without theuse of any CAIM therapies. However, while conventionalmedical practitioners may agree in theory with the necessityfor such an approach to patient care, in practice it tendsto be marginalized [ 47]. Research suggests that psychosocial factors continue to be overlooked by allopathic practitionersin clinical encounters and underemphasized in medicaleducation [ 9]. Although the issue continues to be debated, the degree of importance placed on a particular value by CAIM or allopathic medicine may be more signicant thanwhether a value of patient care is strictly CAIM or allopathic. 4.2. Adequacy of CAM-Related Education. Compared to the graduating medical students ( n =9453) surveyed in the AAMC All Schools Report [ 38], a relatively larger percentage of CAIMAQ survey participants stated that the time devoted to CAM in medical school was inadequate (61% versus 34%).This di erence may be explained in part by variations in question phrasing (e.g., the AAMC item had three responses:inadequate, appropriate and excessive), population biasand/or di erences in study populations. The AAMC report was completed only by graduating medical students, whereasthe CAIMAQ population comprised students in all yearsof medical school. Comparing only fourth-year medicalstudents who completed the CAIMAQ narrows the di erence somewhat (58% versus 34%). As discussed earlier, fourth-year medical students are signicantly more likely to suggestthat they received adequate education in CAM than studentsin earlier years. 4.3. Medical School E ects on Attitudes. In open-ended responses, participants reported that their experiences inmedical school a ected their attitudes toward CAIM. In addition, respondent year in medical school a ected the perceived adequacy of CAM-related education; studentsfurther along in the educational process were more likely to8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine endorse their CAM-related education to be adequate. Still, >60% of participants were in favor of having more CAIM- related education during their time in medical school. Thisview accords with the conclusions of a report by the Instituteof Medicine, Complementary and Alternative Medicine Usein the United States, which noted that \"conventional profes- sionals in particular need enough CAM-related training ...so that they can counsel patients in a manner consistent withhigh-quality comprehensive care\" [ 48,p a g e8 ] . However, while the overall quantity of CAIM-related education in US medical schools has steadily increased,the quality of that education has varied signicantly [ 49- 53]. Some schools have attempted to incorporate CAIM education by providing elective courses, and as early as in1998 a survey of 117 of the existing 125 US medical schoolsfound that 64% of the schools o ered such courses [ 52]. Yet only 47% of CAIMAQ survey participants reported thatcoursework in CAM was o ered at their medical school and only 16% of students reported studying CAM as an elective.Almost a quarter of the participants (24%) were uncertainabout the availability of CAM-related coursework at theirschool. Two themes emerged from participant comments regard- ing the CAIM education they received in medical school.As one participant stated, \"We did take classes in CAM,but they seemed to be of low quality, the lecturers rarelyacknowledged the limitations of the therapies.\" Severalrespondents commented that the CAIM-related educationthey received was biased to be either pro- or anti-CAIM,and of relatively poor quality compared to the rest of their medical education. In the words of another participant, \"I heard a lot of unscientic nonsense, including from medicalstudents and MDs\" . Students who perceive their CAIM-related training as inadequate may be signicantly less opento addressing CAIM-related issues in their interactions withpatients [ 44]. This suggests the need for a uniform and better informed approach to educating future physicians aboutCAIM. Although limited academic research has addressed this area, medical educators have increasingly begun to explorehow best to teach CAIM to allopathically trained physicians,as well as to provide guidelines on teaching CAIM to medicalstudents, residents and fellows [ 54-60]. 4.4. Concluding Thoughts. Analysis of the CAIMAQ pro- vided evidence of its reliability and construct validity andsupports its use in future studies. Further work is required toassess more representative populations in order to determinewhether the relationships found in this study are valid.Future trials should also utilize conrmatory factor analysis to further evaluate the structure revealed in this study. There is a need for emerging physicians to understand and address the practices of CAIM, but the results of thissurvey suggest that signicant obstacles remain. First, whilemedical students appear receptive to the underlying princi-ples of CAIM, they may perceive CAIM therapies as not beingevidence based. From a policy standpoint, this suggests thatfor CAIM to be appropriately integrated into conventionalhealth care, more research is needed, particularly researchthat evaluates the mechanisms, safety and cost-e ectiveness of CAIM therapies. Although future physicians may bewilling to use CAIM themselves, many are unwilling tocross the barrier to recommending or using CAIM intheir practice until more assessment has occurred. Lack ofstudies evaluating the e ectiveness of CAIM may be the principal obstacle to integration by mainstream health carepractitioners. Second, medical student education in CAIM must be improved. Development of a more comprehensive and con-sistent educational approach to teaching medical studentsabout CAIM is necessary if future physicians are to beadequately prepared for their role as health care providers.Just as medical schools have restructured their curricula toreflect the changing practice of medicine and incorporatenew elds of study such as HIV/AIDS, gene therapy andimmunology, medical educators must recognize the impor-tance of educating future doctors in health care systemsoutside of conventional medicine. This education mustbe guided by appropriate evidence, good science and anunderstanding of the di erences inherent in various forms of medicine. Appendices A.

Don't knowStrongly disagreeDisagree Somewhat disagreeNeutral Somewhat agreeAgree Strongly agree (1) A patient's treatment should take into consideration all aspects of his or her physical, mental and spiritualhealth.(2) The focus of a primary care physician should be on promoting health rather than treating disease.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9 (3) Patients whose doctors know about complementary and alternative medicine, in addition to conventionalmedicine, benet more than those whose doctors areonly familiar with conventional medicine. (4) When systems of alternative medicine (such as tradi- tional Chinese medicine) are found to be e cacious in treatment of a disease, doctors should recom-mend them even though these systems may rely onunknown mechanisms. (5) Prayer, for oneself or others, can benet quality of life and disease outcomes. (6) Therapies lacking rigorous support from biomedical research (randomized controlled trials, etc.) maynevertheless be of value to doctors. (7) The spiritual beliefs of patients play an important role in their recovery. (8) A system of medicine that integrates therapies of both conventional medicine and complementary andalternative medicine would be more e ective than either conventional medicine or complementary andalternative medicine provided independently. (9) End-of-life care should be valued as an opportunity for patients to heal. (10) The use of herbal products represents a legitimate form of medicine that can treat a wide variety ofdisease. (11) A patient's mental state influences his or her physical health. (12) Disease occurs when the body's innate ability to heal itself becomes compromised. (13) Patients who express themselves through creative outlets such as art, music or dance may achievesignicant health benets through these activities. (14) Doctors who lead a balanced lifestyle (i.e., attending to their own health, social, family and spiritualneeds, as well as interests beyond medicine) generateimproved patient satisfaction. (15) Complementary and alternative medicine contains beliefs, ideas and therapies from which conventionalmedicine could benet. (16) Chiropractic care can be a valuable method for resolving a wide variety of musculoskeletal problems. (17) A patient with a terminal illness can experience mental and spiritual healing in being at peace withhimself or herself. (18) Massage therapy can lead to objective improvements in long-term outcomes for patients. (19) The innate self-healing capacity of patients often determines the outcome of illness regardless oftreatment interventions. (20) A strong relationship between patients and their doctors is a valuable therapeutic intervention thatleads to improved outcomes.(21) Doctors who model a healthy lifestyle (i.e., follow their own advice) generate improved patient out-comes. (22) Whenever reasonable, a physician should provide patients with hope and a positive attitude toward healing. (23) A patient who is an active participant in his or her care is likely to experience improved outcomescompared with a patient who is a passive participant. (24) Nutritional counseling and dietary/food supplements can be e ective in the treatment of pathology. (25) Doctors should consider referring patients to alter- native health care providers such as homeopaths ornaturopaths for conditions poorly managed by con-ventional medicine. (26) Even in the absence of clinically signicant disease, a person can experience a vast range in terms ofphysical health. (27) It is ethical for doctors to recommend therapies to patients that involve the use of subtle energy elds in and around the body for medical purposes. (28) Therapeutic T ouch is credible as a form of treatment.(29) Disease can be viewed as an opportunity for personal change and growth. (30) Treatments of complementary and alternative medicine tend to be less invasive that those ofconventional medicine, and may help to reduce therisk of side e ects and iatrogenesis. B. Glossary of T erms Chiropractic\u2014A CAM alternative medical system. It focuses on the relationship between bodily structure (primarily thatof the spine) and function, and how that relationship a ects the preservation and restoration of health. Chiropractors usemanipulative therapy as an integral treatment tool. B.1. CAM. A group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices and products that are not presentlyconsidered to be part of conventional medicine. B.2. Conventional Medicine. Conventional medicine is med- icine as practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degrees and by their allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists andregistered nurses. Other terms for conventional medicineinclude allopathy, or western, mainstream, orthodox andregular medicine, and biomedicine. Some conventionalmedical practitioners are also practitioners of CAM. B.3. Dietary Supplements. A dietary supplement is a product (other than tobacco) taken by mouth that contains a \"dietaryingredient\" intended to supplement diet. Dietary ingredientsmay include vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals,amino acids and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues10 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 3 (a) Item Response options What is your gender?-M a l e -F e m a l e What is your age: - Numerical response (18-99) What is your ethnicity?- Hispanic or Latino - Not Hispanic or Latino What is your race?

Open response and metabolites. Dietary supplements come in many forms, including extracts, concentrates, tablets, capsules, gel caps,liquids and powders. B.4. Energy Therapies. Energy therapies involve the use of energy elds. They are of two types. Bioeld therapies areintended to a ect energy elds that may surround and penetrate the human body. Some forms of energy therapymanipulate bioelds by applying pressure and/or manipula-ting the body by placing the hands in, or through, these elds.Examples of this include Qi Gong, Reiki and Therapeu-tic T ouch. Bioelectromagnetic-based therapies involve theunconventional use of electromagnetic elds such as pulsedelds, magnetic elds or alternating- and direct-currentelds. B.5. Herbal Supplements. A type of dietary supplement that contains herbs, either alone or in combination. An herb (alsocalled a botanical) is a plant or plant part used for its scent,flavor and/or therapeutic properties. Herbal supplements(formulas) are used in systems of alternative medicine, suchas traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, under theguidance of trained practitioners. B.6. Homeopathic Medicine. A CAM medical system. In homeopathic medicine, there is a belief that \"like cures like\" ,meaning that small, highly diluted quantities of medicinalsubstances are given to cure symptoms or disease, when thesame substances given at higher or more concentrated doseswould actually cause those symptoms. B.7. Iatrogenisis. This refers to the inadvertent and pre- ventable induction of disease or complications as a result ofmedical treatment or procedures.B.8. Massage Therapy. Massage therapists manipulate muscle and connective tissue to enhance function of those tissuesand promote relaxation and well-being. B.9. Naturopathic Medicine. Also termed naturopathy, this is a CAM medical system. Naturopathic medicine postulatesthat there is a healing power in the body that establishes,maintains and restores health. Practitioners work with thepatient with the goal of supporting this power throughtreatments such as nutrition and lifestyle counseling, dietarysupplements, medicinal plants, exercise, homeopathy and treatments from traditional Chinese medicine. B.10. Therapeutic Touch. This is derived from an ancient technique called laying-on of hands. It is based on thepremise that it is the healing force of the therapist that a ects the patient's recovery; healing is promoted when the body'senergies are in balance; and, by passing their hands over thepatient, healers can identify energy imbalances. B.11. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM is the current name for an ancient system of health care fromChina. TCM is based on a concept of balanced qi, or vitalenergy, that is believed to flow throughout the body. Qi ispostulated to regulate a person's spiritual, emotional, mentaland physical balance and to be influenced by the opposingforces of yin (negative energy) and yang (positive energy).Disease is proposed to result from the flow of qi beingdisrupted and yin and yang becoming imbalanced. Amongthe components of TCM are herbal and nutritional therapy,restorative physical exercise, meditation, acupuncture andremedial massage.12 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine C.
