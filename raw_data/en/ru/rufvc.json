We are at the forefront of integrating health and social care, which means that we care for people in new ways that are more efficient, with health and social care professionals who would have previously worked in individual teams now working together. This helps us to deliver the right care for people, in the right place and at the right time. You will find our teams in community hospitals, GP practices, sports centres, health and wellbeing hubs, at community events and even at football matches. In 2019 Livewell Southwest was inspected by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and received a rating of 'good' overall. Our mental health inpatient unit (Glenbourne) and our community learning disabilities team received an exceptional rating of 'outstanding'.
