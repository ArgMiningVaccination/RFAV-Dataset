I just figured it was going to be something we could get under control fast. Then we received our first patient. COVID patients get sick fast. Their lungs become stiff and extremely hard to ventilate, sometimes very quickly. It's a very scary virus. \"I'm the one who removes the breathing tube and takes them off life support or off other machines that help push air into their lungs. If my patient starts crying, I'm right there with them. But sometimes I cry, too. I try to be their support until the end. \"COVID patients stay at the hospital for weeks, sometimes months, so we become very close to them. Sometimes we see multiple code blues or deaths in a day. It takes an emotional toll on us. With the overwhelming amount of patients in the hospital right now, we're physically and mentally exhausted. Thanks to Lippert Components, Inc. (LCI), Beacon Health System is even better equipped to meet our healthcare workers' mental health needs. Through a substantial gift, LCI is investing in the mental wellbeing of frontline healthcare workers throughout our region. With their support, we are providing non-traditional virtual counseling for associates which is safe, accessible and meets their busy schedules. In December and January, we provided on-site counseling for our associates, focusing on our critical care units at Elkhart General and Memorial Hospitals. Ongoing, Beacon has created a multi-disciplinary team focused on developing programs for mental health access, awareness, and spiritual-care support in addition to Mental Health Lunch and Learn and Self-care/Stress Management. In order for our local industry to be relevant over the long term, we need healthy workers. \"When the community works together, anything is possible, and I believe we have one of the best communities in the country. My hope is this gift will inspire other business leaders to come forward and donate to this cause, which is essential for our courageous men and women working on the frontlines,\" explains Jason Lippert, LCI's CEO. Lippert Components: Healing Our Courageous Men and Women Thank you for taking care of us so we can take care of you! Your frontline healthcare workers have battled the COVID-19 virus and they are exhausted. They have rallied time and time again to treat and heal every patient who walked through our doors. Over the past year, you have rallied to show your support. In so many generous and thoughtful ways, you helped us push through. With our deepest gratitude, we thank you for the care you continue to show us! 1st Source Foundation: Uplifting Spirits Sometimes an unexpected gift makes all the difference. This past year, 1st Source Foundation partnered with us to spread joy in the hearts of an exhausted team. They graciously provided an unrestricted gift and asked Beacon to use it in the most meaningful way to impact our frontline teams. 1st Source Foundation's generosity allowed us to offer healing and love to so many who have gone above and beyond in our community. It was the very thing our team needed the most; it lifted the spirits of hundreds of Healthcare Heroes who have been doing their best to push through the exhaustion, the chaos, the fear, and the unknown. 312 NEW DONORS 489 TOTAL DONORS $466,000 RAISED 1,900 COVID SCREENINGS 1,700 FREE COVID TESTS 2,000+ ADMINISTERED VACCINES 10,000+ FRONTLINE MEALS 31,000+ DONATED FACE MASKS 134,000+ PAIRS OF DONATED GLOVES 75+ LOCAL BUSINESS PARTNERS \"Even the days I'm not at work, I'm always thinking about my patients. Are they going to be there when I get back? Are they getting better? Ever since COVID started, I just can't shut my brain off about work. \"Our community needs to understand that this is a serious virus. It's very real. It's important to follow the CDC guidelines and wear a mask, wash your hands, and social distance. You don't want to be on the other end of this, fighting for your life.\" By: Heidi Prescott-Wieneke Holiday Gift Bags To date 1,500+ test fittings Healthcare Heroes and their families visited the Wellfield Gardens 2020 Holiday Lights3,750 4,000 25 5 581BECAUSE OF 1ST SOURCE FOUNDATION'S GENEROSITY: \"Thank you so much for the use of the Theragun Massager. We are so happy! We are all so stressed that we are crying on our way to work and on the way home. Just yesterday, I had two code blues, one RAT call, and one COVID death before noon, and we're all a mess. I had to call the Coroner twice before noon, and both calls went to voicemail. When she called back, she apologized for the voicemail. She said, \"I am so overwhelmed by the amount of deaths inside and outside the hospital and cannot keep up.\" Please pray for our coroners, too. - Berri, RN Love Notes from Kids in Our Community Join Us!
