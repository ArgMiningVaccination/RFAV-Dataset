People feel tired and have tissue swelling (edema). Diagnosis is based on blood and urine tests and sometimes imaging of the kidneys, a biopsy of the kidneys, or both. People who have disorders that may cause nephrotic syndrome are given angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) to slow kidney damage. Restriction of sodium intake plus diuretics and statins are also used to treat this disorder.

Nephrotic syndrome can occur at any age. In children, it is most common between the ages of 18 months and 4 years, and more males than females are affected. In older people, both sexes are equally affected. Excessive protein excretion into the urine (proteinuria) results in low levels of important proteins, such as albumin, in the blood.

The syndrome may be caused by certain allergies, including allergies to insect bites and to poison ivy or poison oak. Some types of nephrotic syndrome are hereditary. Symptoms of Nephrotic Syndrome Early symptoms include Loss of appetite A general feeling of illness (malaise) Puffy eyelids and tissue swelling (edema) due to excess sodium and water retention Abdominal pain Frothy urine The abdomen may be swollen because of a large accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity ( [ascites](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/manifestations-of-liver-disease/ascites) [ Ascites Ascites is the accumulation of protein-containing (ascitic) fluid within the abdomen.

Most often, the fluid that causes tissue swelling is affected by gravity and therefore moves around. During the night, fluid accumulates in the upper parts of the body, such as the eyelids. During the day, when the person is sitting or standing, fluid accumulates in the lower parts of the body, such as the ankles. Swelling may hide the muscle wasting that is progressing at the same time. In children, blood pressure is generally low, and blood pressure may fall when the child stands up ( [orthostatic or postural hypotension)](/home/heart-and-blood-vessel-disorders/symptoms-of-heart-and-blood-vessel-disorders/dizziness-or-light-headedness-when-standing-up) [ Dizziness or Light-Headedness When Standing Up In some people, particularly older people, blood pressure drops excessively when they sit or stand up (a condition called orthostatic or postural hypotension).

Problems in the... read more ](/home/bone,-joint,-and-muscle-disorders/autoimmune-disorders-of-connective-tissue/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle) Diagnosis of Nephrotic Syndrome Urine and blood tests A doctor bases the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome on symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory findings. Sometimes nephrotic syndrome is at first mistaken for heart failure in older adults because swelling occurs in both disorders and heart failure is common among older people. A laboratory test of urine collected over a 24-hour period is useful for measuring the degree of protein loss, but collection of urine over such a long period is difficult for many people to accomplish. Alternatively, to estimate protein loss, a single urine specimen can be tested to measure the ratio of the level of protein to that of creatinine (a waste product). Blood tests and other urine tests detect additional characteristics of the syndrome. The level of albumin in the blood is low because this vital protein is excreted in the urine and its production is impaired. The urine often contains clumps of cells that may be combined with protein and fat (casts). The urine contains low levels of sodium and high levels of potassium. Concentrations of lipid in the blood are high, sometimes exceeding 10 times that of a normal concentration. Levels of lipid in the urine are also high. [Anemia](/home/blood-disorders/anemia/overview-of-anemia) [ Overview of Anemia Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that enables them to carry oxygen from the lungs and deliver it to all parts... read more ](/home/blood-disorders/anemia/overview-of-anemia) may be present. Levels of blood clotting proteins may be increased or decreased. Determining the cause of nephrotic syndrome The doctor investigates possible causes of nephrotic syndrome, including medications or illicit drugs. Analysis of the urine and blood may reveal an underlying disorder. For example, the blood is tested for evidence of previous infections that could cause nephrotic syndrome and for antibodies directed against the body's own tissues (called autoantibodies), which indicate an [autoimmune disorder](/home/immune-disorders/allergic-reactions-and-other-hypersensitivity-disorders/autoimmune-disorders) [ Autoimmune Disorders An autoimmune disorder is a malfunction of the body's immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues.

X-rays are usually not helpful in evaluating... read more ](/home/kidney-and-urinary-tract-disorders/diagnosis-of-kidney-and-urinary-tract-disorders/imaging-tests-of-the-urinary-tract) , such as ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT), may be done. If the person has lost weight or is older, a search for cancer is undertaken. A kidney biopsy is especially useful in determining the cause and extent of kidney damage. Treatment of Nephrotic Syndrome Treatment of the cause Medications Dietary management and other measures Treatment of the cause of nephrotic syndrome Whenever possible, specific treatment is aimed at the cause. Treating an infection that causes nephrotic syndrome may cure the syndrome. If a treatable disease, such as certain cancers, causes nephrotic syndrome, treating that disease can eliminate the syndrome. If a heroin user with nephrotic syndrome stops using heroin in the early stages of the disease, the syndrome may resolve. If other medications or illicit drugs are responsible for the syndrome, stopping these may be curative. People who are sensitive or allergic to poison oak, poison ivy, or insect bites should avoid these irritants. Medications When a person who already has nephrotic syndrome is treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), symptoms may decrease, the amount of protein excreted in the urine usually decreases, and fat concentrations in the blood are likely to decline. However, these medications can increase the potassium levels in the blood in people who have moderate to severe [kidney failure](/home/kidney-and-urinary-tract-disorders/kidney-failure/overview-of-kidney-failure) [ Overview of Kidney Failure Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood.

[High blood pressure](/home/heart-and-blood-vessel-disorders/high-blood-pressure) [ High Blood Pressure ](/home/heart-and-blood-vessel-disorders/high-blood-pressure) is usually treated with diuretics. Diuretics can also reduce fluid retention and tissue swelling but may increase the risk of blood clots. Anticoagulants may help control clot formation if it occurs. Infections can be life threatening and must be treated promptly. Statins, medications that lower the amount of cholesterol in the blood, may also be needed if people have increased levels of fats (lipids) in the blood. If no reversible cause can be found, the person may be given corticosteroids and other medications that suppress the immune system, such as cyclophosphamide. However, corticosteroids cause problems, particularly for children, in whom these medications can stunt growth and suppress sexual development (see sidebar ). Dietary management and other measures General therapy for nephrotic syndrome includes a diet that contains normal amounts of protein and potassium but that is low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. If fluid accumulates in the abdomen, the person may need to eat frequent, small meals because the fluid reduces the capacity of the stomach. People should receive the [pneumococcal vaccine](/home/infections/immunization/pneumococcal-vaccine) [ Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal vaccines help protect against bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). Pneumococcal infections include ear infections, sinusitis, pneumonia... read more ](/home/infections/immunization/pneumococcal-vaccine) . Rarely, so much protein is lost in the urine that the kidneys must be removed. Prognosis for Nephrotic Syndrome The prognosis varies depending on the Cause of the nephrotic syndrome Person's age Type of kidney damage Degree of kidney damage Symptoms may disappear completely if the nephrotic syndrome is caused by a treatable disorder, such as an infection, cancer, or medications, provided the condition is treated early and effectively. This situation occurs in about half the cases in children but less often in adults. If the underlying disorder responds to corticosteroids, sometimes progression of the disease is halted, and less often the condition partially or, rarely, completely reverses.
