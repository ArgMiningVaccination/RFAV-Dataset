But we must act quickly and give ourselves the very best chance to succeed,\" Mr Gates said today during a United Nations meeting calling for a renewed global commitment to destroy the disease. In 1988, when an international vaccination program began, polio was rampant in 125 countries, leaving 350,000 children paralysed each year. Today polio is endemic in three countries, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and so far this year 145 new cases have been reported. India has been polio-free for the past 18 months. But those leading the fight against the disease are concerned that global commitment is wavering as the number of cases decreases. Speaking with Fairfax Media last week ahead of today's meeting, Mr Gates said billions more were needed to vaccinate those children leaving in or near polio \"sanctuaries\" to ensure the disease is destroyed by 2018. The director-general of the World Health Organisation said failure to eradicate polio was ''unforgivable' and ''not an option''. ''No single one of us can bring this long, hard drive over the last hurdle. But together we can,'' said Dr Margaret Chan. Wilfrid J. Wilkinson, Chair of Rotary Foundation Trustees said: \"Governments need to step up and honour their commitments to polio eradication if we are to achieve a polio-free world. ''We must seize the advantage by acting immediately, or risk breaking our pledge to the world's children.\" Rotary International, which already has contributed $A1.15 billion to polio eradication, announced additional funding of $72 million over three years.The Islamic Development Bank announced a three-year $217 million financing package for Pakistan, which will cover the majority of the country's polio vaccination campaign costs. It also announced a $2.9 million grant for polio eradication activities in Afghanistan. Speaking on the phone last week, Mr Gates said that aside from the catastrophic human cost, a failure to eradicated the disease now could cost billions more in future health funding. Mr Gates has thrown behind the cause funds from his $35 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as his own considerable lobbying weight. He said he had targeted polio not only because the goal was achievable, but because it would reinforce how effective mass vaccination can be. The campaign has been hampered not only by cost, but by rumours in parts of Pakistan that the vaccination program is part of a Western plot to sterilise Muslims. Mr Gates said he has found as much satisfaction in spending his vast fortune through the Foundation as he had building it through the creation of Microsoft, the company he co-founded in 1975.
