Rather than consulting a single, authoritative source, they usually want a variety of opinions. At the same time, people are often exposed to information about vaccination online without necessarily looking for it. The associated amplification of risk and risk perception through social media, has led some countries and health authorities to start monitoring social media platforms in order to counter the spread of misinformation and rebuild public trust in vaccination. The purpose of this systematic scoping review was to analyse the social media monitoring techniques and interventions with the following objectives: - identify preferences: which social media platforms do users choose as a source of information on vaccination and how does that influence their perceptions of vaccination? - identify different methods and tools for social media monitoring in the context of vaccination including their strengths and weaknesses. review how such monitoring and information gathered from social media monitoring can be used to inform communication strategies around immunisation. - identify the uses, benefits and limitations of social media as an intervention tool in relation to vaccination (i.e. how effective social media is as an intervention tool for increasing vaccination). An extensive database search led to the inclusion of 115 scientific articles in the review, looking at the use of social media, social media monitoring and (public health) interventions. The review results show for example that between 4 and 62% of various study populations in different countries use social media as a source of information on vaccination, with results varying by type of social media platform. Overall, Facebook was the most common social media resource for information on vaccination. Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Digital Health 2017 Vaccine hesitancy, traditionally linked to issues of trust, misinformation and prior beliefs, has been increasingly fuelled by influential groups on social media (SM) and the Internet. Analysis of news media and social networks (SN) accessible in real-time provides a new opportunity for detecting changes in public confidence in vaccines. However, different concerns are important in different regions, and reasons for hesitancy and the role of opinion leaders vary between sub-controversies in the broader vaccination debates. It is therefore important for public health professionals to gain an overview of the emerging debates in cyberspace, identify influential users and rumours, and assess their impact in order to know how to respond. The VAC Medi+Board project aims to visualise the diffusion of rumours through SN and assess the impact of key individuals. We include, as a case study, discussions during winter 2015-16 pertaining to the alleged side-effects of the HPV vaccine. Background: The emergence of social media is providing an alternative avenue for information exchange and opinion formation on health-related issues. Collective discourse in such media leads to the formation of a complex narrative, conveying public views and perceptions. Objective: This paper presents a study of Twitter narrative regarding vaccination in the aftermath of the 2015 measles outbreak, both in terms of its cyber and physical characteristics. We aimed to contribute to the analysis of the data, as well as presenting a quantitative interdisciplinary approach to analyze such open-source data in the context of health narratives. Methods: We collected 669,136 tweets referring to vaccination from February 1 to March 9, 2015. These tweets were analyzed to identify key terms, connections among such terms, retweet patterns, the structure of the narrative, and connections to the geographical space. Results: The data analysis captures the anatomy of the themes and relations that make up the discussion about vaccination in Twitter. The results highlight the higher impact of stories contributed by news organizations compared to direct tweets by health organizations in communicating health-related information. They also capture the structure of the antivaccination narrative and its terms of reference. Analysis also revealed the relationship between community engagement in Twitter and state policies regarding child vaccination. Residents of Vermont and Oregon, the two states with the highest rates of non-medical exemption from school-entry vaccines nationwide, are leading the social media discussion in terms of participation. Conclusions: The interdisciplinary study of health-related debates in social media across the cyber-physical debate nexus leads to a greater understanding of public concerns, views, and responses to health-related issues. Further coalescing such capabilities shows promise towards advancing health communication, thus supporting the design of more effective strategies that take into account the complex and evolving public views of health issues. 2013 Social Media + Society 2019 Many states in the United States allow a \"belief exemption\" for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines. People's opinion on whether or not to take the vaccine can have direct consequences in public health. Social media has been one of the dominant communication channels for people to express their opinions of vaccination. Despite governmental organizations' efforts of disseminating information of vaccination benefits, anti-vaccine sentiment is still gaining momentum. Studies have shown that bots on social media (i.e., social bots) can influence opinion trends by posting a substantial number of automated messages. The research presented here investigates the communication patterns of anti- and pro-vaccine users and the role of bots in Twitter by studying a retweet network related to MMR vaccine after the 2015 California Disneyland measles outbreak. We first classified the users into anti-vaccination, neutral to vaccination, and pro-vaccination groups using supervised machine learning. We discovered that pro- and anti-vaccine users retweet predominantly from their own opinion group. In addition, our bot analysis discovers that 1.45% of the corpus users were identified as likely bots which produced 4.59% of all tweets within our dataset. We further found that bots display hyper-social tendencies by initiating retweets at higher frequencies with users within the same opinion group. The article concludes that highly clustered anti-vaccine Twitter users make it difficult for health organizations to penetrate and counter opinionated information while social bots may be deepening this trend. We believe that these findings can be useful in developing strategies for health communication of vaccination. Many states in the US allow a \" belief exemption \" for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines. People's opinion on whether or not to take the vaccine could have direct consequences in public health\u2014 once the vaccine refusal of a group within a population is higher than what herd immunity can tolerate, a disease can transmit fast causing large scale of disease outbreaks. Social media has been one of the dominant communication channels for people to express their opinions of vaccination. Despite governmental organizations' efforts of disseminating information of vaccination benefits, anti-vaccine sentiment is still gaining its momentum, especially on social media. This research investigates the communicative patterns of anti-vaccine and pro-vaccine users in Twitter by studying the retweet network from 660,892 tweets related to MMR vaccine published by 269,623 users after the 2015 California Disneyland measles outbreak. Using supervised learning, we classified the users into anti-vaccination, neutral to vaccination, and pro-vaccination groups. Using a combination of opinion groups and retweet network structural community detection, we discovered that pro-and anti-vaccine users retweet predominantly from their own opinion group, while users with neutral opinions are distributed across communities. For most cross-group communication, it was found that pro-vaccination users were retweeting anti-vaccination users than vice-versa. The paper concludes that anti-vaccine Twitter users are highly clustered and enclosed communities, and this makes it difficult for health organizations to penetrate and counter opinionated information. We believe that this finding may be useful in developing strategies for health communication of vaccination and overcome some the limits of current strategies. International Journal of Community Medicine and Public Health 2018 Background: The media news influence shapes the public sentiments and behaviour. The recent experiences indicate significant influence of online news and social media on immunization behaviour in India. The objective was to study the profile and sentiments of online media news on vaccine and vaccination in India. Methods: We searched the online news published during November 2015 to October 2017. The news contents were interpreted and categorised according to the vaccine and sentiments. Results: Out of the total 1430 news items, 763 were eligible for review after removal of duplicates and unrelated items. Majority (75.5%) of the news were on the immunization program. While 45.5% news originated from sub-state level, 19.3% from state and 35.2% were from national levels. The measles-rubella vaccine topped the news (23.5%) followed by poliomyelitis (10.4%) and Japanese encephalitis (6.6%) vaccines. While 65.8% of news was positive, 27.9% and 6.35% were negative and neutral respectively. The negative news comprised of the adverse events, social resistance, and vaccine shortageent. Conclusions: A sizable proportion of news contained negative messages, which may influence public vaccine behaviour. Past experiences (pentavalent and measles-rubella) calls for regular monitoring of media messages and adopt appropriate communication strategy to retain vaccine confidence and reduce vaccine hesitancy.

The report quantifies the effects of social media in different languages on the spread of anti-vaccination sentiment. Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics 2014 In June 2013 the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) suspended its HPV vaccination recommendation after a series of highly publicized alleged adverse events following immunization stoked public doubts about the vaccine's safety. This paper examines the global spread of the news of Japan's HPV vaccine suspension through online media, and takes a retrospective look at non-Japanese media sources that were used to support those claiming HPV vaccine injury in Japan. Two searches were conducted. One searched relevant content in an archive of Google Alerts on vaccines and vaccine preventable diseases. The second search was conducted using Google Search on January 6th 2014 and on July 18th 2014, using the keywords, \"HPV vaccine Japan\" and \"cervical cancer vaccine Japan.\" Both searches were used as Google Searches render more (and some different) results than Google Alerts.
