To clearly understand the principles of Allopathic or Western Medicine, we must first examine the fundamental nature of \"food' consisting of fruits, vegetables, herbs and animal products. These foods provide some variable combinations of proteins, carbohydrates and fats. All of these components are essential to human existence, each performing some important physiological function. The proportions of each component are dependent upon the specific varieties of foods. Before the advent of pharmaceuticals, about one and fifty years ago, herbal remedies and foods in general were the only available means of providing both nourishment and presumed healing. Foods comprise numerous phytochemicals (natural compounds) applied to human physiology in a broad spectrum of biochemical components. Consequently, the science of medicine relied upon the interdependent chemistry of such components in providing fuel and medicine through absorption of minerals, vitamins and micro nutrients in support of the human immune system. The philosophy of complementary combinations of such phytochemicals (inherent in food) and operating in a balanced system of \"homeostasis\" was considered to be a natural system of health maintenance and resistance to disease. The prevailing concept relied on food (particularly plants and herbs) to support the human immune system in defense against disease. Many pathways available to various liver generated enzymes act in combination to maintain homeostasis. Allopathic medicines rely on the supposition that single organic compounds can enter into the complex human organic system and alter some activity \"pathway\" which is designed to interrupt the progress of a disease condition or even eliminate it. The scientific issues of this philosophy relate to the state of knowledge concerning the cause and effect of specific chemical reactions. Questions arise as to the extent of both beneficial and negative outcomes. The completeness of measurement of known theoretical actions and some yet unknown and undetermined effects bear a direct relationship to both safety and efficacy of such single organic medicines physiologically. The proponents of allopathic medicines insist that although the overall physiological impact of single compound \"pathways\" are yet unknown and time dependent, they are unlikely to pose significant risk to patients. To which specific branch of medical science does clairvoyance belong? There is an intransigent degree of \"faith\" in the allopathic philosophy and its governmental establishment as the one and only form of medicine available to the public. Although freedom of choice is guaranteed by the Constitution for individuals with respect to their health choices, access to alternative medicines are seriously limited by regulatory restrictions on the manufacture and sale of unapproved medicines. Only allopathic remedies can be approved and made freely available to the public. Single organic compounds are identified and designed to alter specific liver functions, following delivery by attachment to the substrates of specific polymeric compound. They cause designed changes in specific protein/enzyme production or elimination to effect a particular pathway reaction. The resultant liver generated compounds will be altered in some desired way to interrupt the specifically observed disease function. Little or no attention is given to other potential \"pathways\" which may occur over time and not immediately recognized nor theoretically considered. The benefits are automatically considered to offset any negative impacts. There is undeniable confidence in the allopathic \"community\" that the downside effects of prescription drugs are always infrequent in occurrence and minor in effect. The advent of the early \"drugs\" comprising single molecules (compounds), applied to single physiological \"pathways\" to eliminate or interrupt the progress of disease became the \"state of the art\" method in medicine because they provided a simpler and cost effective method of treatment. The proposed postulate indicated that a more positive method of treating disease was achieved by this direct \"single pathway\" approach, utilizing single organic molecules. It proved to be more immediate in its effect as distinct from the relatively slow acting \"natural\" methods, which depended upon the interdependent components of healthy diets. In identifying the target disease pathways and applicable single molecules, it was observed that single ingredients required for the purpose could be fractionated from specific plants or herbs, dried, tableted and prescribed as medicines. \"Naturalists\" argued that such fractionated components would be less efficacious than the total collective ingredients inherently comprising the whole food, but it was rejected, primarily because of economic and commercial reasons. However, a clear advantage of the pharmaceutical approach was the relative speed in which positive outcomes could be achieved. At this juncture, the progress and general acceptance of pharmaceutical medicine was essentially assured. It provided commercial opportunities to establish major business entities without corresponding competition from food suppliers. The emergence of the Food and Drug Administration guaranteed a complete separation between food and drugs in a distinctly separate categorization of food and drug applications. Consequently, drugs can never be considered nutritious (obviously) and foods can never be considered medicinal (illogical). Fractionating specific ingredients from plants and herbs (as well as synthesized forms) provide higher concentrations of the \"active ingredients\", designed to operate via target pathways to treat disease. The successful delivery of sufficient \"active ingredients\" to the disease\" site\" (bioavailability) involves higher concentrations to offset inefficiencies encountered in the digestive system. The counter argument that fractionated components absorb less efficiently than the whole food combination of ingredients is argued, although the attendant issues of toxicity cannot be dismissed. Pharmaceutical medicines (prescription) delivered via the digestive system, rely on the supposition that single organic compounds can enter into the complex human organic system and alter some activity \"pathway\", which is designed to interrupt the progress of a disease condition or even eliminate it. The scientific issues of this philosophy relate to the state of knowledge concerning the cause and effect of specific physiological reactions. Questions arise as to the extent of both beneficial and negative outcomes. The completeness of measurement of known theoretical actions and some yet unknown and undetermined effects bear a direct relationship to both safety and efficacy of such single organic medicines. The proponents of allopathic medicines insist that although the overall physiological impact of single compound \"pathways\" is yet unknown and time dependent, they are unlikely to pose significant risk to patients. To which specific branch of medical science does clairvoyance belong? There is an over reaching degree of \"faith\" in the allopathic philosophy and its governmental establishment as the one and only form of medicine available to the public. Although freedom of choice is guaranteed by the Constitution for individuals with respect to their health choices, access to alternative medicines are seriously limited by regulatory restrictions on the manufacture and sale of unapproved medicines.

The benefits are automatically considered to offset any negative impacts. There is undeniable confidence in the allopathic \"community\" that the downside effects of prescription drugs are always infrequent in occurrence and minor in effect. This distorted view of pertinent facts appears to be prompted by economic pressures and commercial reasoning. The basic argument against the exclusive reign of pharmaceutical medicines relates to safety in respect to health risks. There is little doubt that our present pharmaceutical based system provides significant benefits with highly probable, yet unknown risks in attendance. Such downside effects are clearly time dependent occurrences and affect the practice of disease prevention by such means. By definition, acute diseases have limited time spans, they either end in cure or final demise. Consequently, applying pharmaceutical remedies to acute diseases is eminently desirable because the time dependent risk events are avoided. Conversely, the management and control of chronic diseases with pharmaceutical medicines are long term and often lifelong constituting risks of unknown frequency and severity. Logically, the attendant risks are not always justified. There appears to be an aspect of the \"Natural Law\" that indicates a time dependent relationship relative to ingredient concentrations delivered via the digestive system. In the case of whole foods, the relatively lower concentrations of specific ingredients result in a slower remedial benefit than the faster acting, more highly concentrated pharmaceutical method. However, there appears to be an offsetting disadvantage of time dependent toxicity risks. Different circumstances will determine the need for fast acting pharmaceutical remedies or slower but safer natural applications. The effective exclusivity of pharmaceuticals as the only viable medicines in our health care system is totally irrational. "}
