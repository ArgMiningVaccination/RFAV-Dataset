Read our | |ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04792567| | | Recruitment Status : Completed First Posted : March 11, 2021 Last Update Posted : December 14, 2022 - Study Details [Tabular View](/ct2/show/record/NCT04792567) 4| This is a three cohort, multicenter, open-label, prospective study of 60 (optionally up to 90) multiple sclerosis (MS) patients currently treated with siponimod or a first-line disease modifying therapy (DMT) or without MS treatment in clinical routine planning to undergo a SARS-CoV-2 modRNA vaccination as part of clinical routine. The maximal duration of the study for an individual patient is 14 months. - The first cohort in this study will be participants not interrupting their current siponimod therapy for the purpose of a SARS-CoV-2 modRNA vaccination. - The second cohort will be participants interrupting their current siponimod therapy for the purpose of a SARS-CoV-2 modRNA vaccination for approximately 2-3 months. - The third cohort will be participants receiving modRNA vaccine while on treatment with the following first-line DMTs (dimethylfumarate, glatirameracetate, interferons, teriflunomide) or no current treatment in clinical routine. The study will investigate the development of functional anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and T-cell titers for six months after the to SARS-CoV-2 modRNA Vaccines in Participants With Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Mayzent (Siponimod)| |Actual Study Start Date :||April Date :||September | Continuous treatment with siponimod (oral, daily, dose depending on CYP2C9 genotype: 2mg or 1 mg) during SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination | Drug: BAF312 | taken orally once per day (dose depends on CYP2C9 genotype) Other Name: Siponimod | Experimental: Siponimod- daily, dose depending on CYP2C9 genotype: 2mg or 1 mg) with treatment interruption (for approx. 2-3 months) for the purpose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination | Drug: BAF312 | taken orally once per day (dose depends on CYP2C9 genotype) Other Name: Siponimod | Active Comparator: Comparator | Baseline DMTs or no treatment during SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination | Dimethylfumarate, glatirameracetate, interferon, teriflunomode according to respective SmPC - Percentage of participants achieving seroconversion after receiving a modRNA vaccine [ Time Frame: at 1 week after second dose of vaccine ]Seroconversion is defined by detection of SARS-CoV-2 serum functional antibodies - SARS-CoV-2 serum functional antibody levels over time [ Time Frame: at baseline, 1 week, 1 month and 6 months after second dose of vaccine ]SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies measured at the central laboratory - T-cell response to modRNA vaccines over time [ Time Frame: at baseline, 1 week, 1 month and 6 months after second dose of vaccine ]SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell levels measured at the central laboratory e.g. by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELIspot) assay from peripheral blood mononuclear cells - Number of treatment emergent adverse events, serious adverse events and COVID-19 infections [ Time Frame: Up to 12 months after second dose of vaccine ]Untoward medical occurrences (including abnormal laboratory tests, vital signs and other safety assessments) will be captured as adverse events and COVID-19 infections will be recorded Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
