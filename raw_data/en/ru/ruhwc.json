FREQUENTLY BOUGHT TOGETHER The phrase \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" rings true for canine bone and joint health just as it does for humans. The \"Help, My Joints Are Stiff\" Nutra Bites is a fuss-free supplement snack that makes preventative care and pain management easy. Joint problems are commonly found in larger breeds, senior dogs, and dogs with a history of injuries, but it's never too early for preventative care too. These bites have been formulated for dogs of all sizes, for all ages, and are suitable whether they're in good health, trying to manage pain, or looking to prevent further joint damage. *Not suitable for pregnant or nursing dogs. Our homeopathic Nutra Bites has been developed by homeopathic veterinarians, herbalists, and nutrition experts. Our Nutra Bites and Soft & Chewy functional supplements support good health across a range of health issues. The active ingredients in these joint supplements are packed with sugar-bonding glycosides that give immunity a boost, as well as flavonoids, glycosides, chlorophyll, niacin, calcium, curcumin, riboflavin, and vitamins A, B1, B12, C, D, E & K. Active Ingredients to Support Health: Turmeric (Curcuma longa) has a range of properties that may be important for helping with joint function and maintaining healthy bones. Horsetail fern (Equisetum arvense) contains a vast array of compounds that may heal bone and connective tissue attributed to its silica content and anti-inflammatory properties. Marigold (Calendula officinalis) may assist with the healthy flow of lymphatic wastes (fluids that build up in joints). Alfalfa (Medicago officinalis) is an anti-inflammatory plant known for rebuilding and supporting joint health. Flax seeds (Linus usitatissimum) are an anti-inflammatory source of omega fatty acids (Omega-3, 6, & 9) and are ideal for maintaining healthy skin, shiny fur, and good joint health. Spirulina (Spirulina platensis) may promote and strengthen the immune system, improve gastrointestinal health, aid in detoxification, and help relieve seasonal allergies. Rosehip (Rosa canina) provides clinically proven plant-based immune system support for improving joint health and general well-being of active and aging dogs. Contains high levels of vitamin C, an important factor in the absorption of other minerals for joint and tissue support. Although dogs make their vitamin C (unlike humans), stressed or injured dogs show low vitamin C, and thus supplementation is important.
