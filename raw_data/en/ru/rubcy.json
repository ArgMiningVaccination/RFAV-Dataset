Criteria applicable to applications. North Dakota Century Code section 23-17.5-03 sets forth the standards by which the department is to measure whether the likely benefits to health care consumers resulting from the cooperative agreement outweigh any disadvantages attributable to a reduction in competition that may result from the agreement. a. Potential benefits. In evaluating the potential benefits to health care consumers from a cooperative agreement. the department may consider the following criteria: (1) Enhancement of the quality of health care services. The department may consider the likely effect of the cooperative agreement on patient or client outcomes. The department may consider the standards and criteria used by the applicable professional 110 accreditation or certification agencies or bodies or any other generally accepted quality measures. (2) Geographical proximity of health care facilities to the communities traditionally served. The department may consider the extent to which the cooperative agreement is likely to: (a) Make a new health care service or product available in a particular geographic area. (b) Prevent the closing or substantial downsizing of a health care facility or the elimination or reduction of a health care service that would otherwise be likely to occur without the cooperative agreement. (c) Preserve health care facilities or services in one community at the expense of health care facilities or services in another community. (3) Gains in cost efficiency. The department may consider the extent to which the proposed cooperative agreement is likely to result in: (a) Any cost savings to the applicants. (b) Any cost savings being passed on to the health care consumer. (c) Cost shifting through higher prices to other payers or purchasers of other products and services. (d) Reduced costs of regulation, both for the state and the applicants. (e) Any other result likely to reduce costs to health care consumers. (f) The extent to which any cost savings will be obtained at the expense of a degradation of the quality of medical products or services. (4) Improvements in the utilization of health care resources and equipment. (5) Avoidance of duplication of health care resources. The department may consider: (a) The extent to which the same or substitute products or services are available in the same community or geographic market. 111 (b) Any excess capacity in the prov1s1on of the same or substitute products and services existing within the same community or geographical market. b. Potential disadvantages. In evaluating the disadvantages attributable to a reduction in competition that may result from a cooperative agreement, the department may consider: (1) The relevant product and geographic markets to which the agreement will be administered. In determining the relevant markets, the department may take into account elasticities of supply and demand and the ability of a hypothetical monopolist to profitably reduce output and increase price in a small but significant and nontransitory manner. (2) The existing market shares in the relevant product and geographic markets of the applicants, as well as any other parties operating within those markets.

Where only one C is measured, T is the time in minutes that it takes for water to move from the point of disinfectant application to a point before or at where C is measured. Where more than one C is measured, T, for the first measurement of C, is the time in minutes that it takes the water to move from the first or only point of disinfectant application to a point before or at the point where the first C is measured. For subsequent measurements of C, T is the time in minutes that it takes for water to move from the previous C measurement point to the C measurement point for which the particular T is being calculated. Disinfectant contact time in pipelines must be calculated by dividing the internal volume of the pipe by the maximum hourly flow rate through that pipe.

Community water systems which serve a population of ten thousand or more individuals and which add a disinfectant to the water in any part of the drinking water treatment process shall collect samples for the purpose of analysis for total trihalomethanes. b. Sampling frequency. The minimum number of samples required to be taken by the system shall be based on the number of treatment plants used by the system. Multiple wells drawing raw water from a single aquifer may. with the departments approval, be considered one treatment plant. All samples taken within an established frequency shall be collected within a twenty-four-hour period. (1) Routine sampling. Analyses for total trihalomethanes shall be performed at quarterly intervals on at least four water samples for each treatment plant used by the system. At least twenty-five percent of the 142 samples shall be taken at locations within the distribution system reflecting the maximum residence time of the water in the system. The remaining seventy-five percent shall be taken at representative locations in the distribution system, taking into account number of persons served, different sources of water, and different treatment methods employed. (2) Reduced sampling frequency. (a) Systems utilizing surface water or a combination of surface and ground water. The sampling frequency may be reduced to a minimum of one sample analyzed per quarter taken at a point in the distribution system reflecting the maximum residence time of the water in the system. The systems sampling frequency may only be reduced upon written request by the system and upon a determination by the department that data from at least one year of sampling at a frequency of four samples collected per calendar quarter per water treatment plant used by the system and local conditions demonstrate that total trihalomethane concentrations will be consistently below the maximum contaminant level. If at any time during which the reduced sampling frequency is in effect, the result from any analysis exceeds the maximum contaminant level and such results are confirmed by at least one check sample taken promptly after such results are received, or if the system makes any significant change to its source of water or treatment program, the system shall immediately resume sampling on a routine basis of four samples per quarter per treatment plant used by the system. Such increased sampling shall continue for at least one year before the frequency may be reduced again. (b) Systems utilizing only ground water. The sampling frequency may be reduced to a minimum of one sample analyzed per year per water treatment plant taken at a point in the distribution system reflecting the maximum residence time of the water in the system. The systems sampling frequency may only be reduced upon written request by the system and upon a determination by the department that the system has a maximum total trihalomethane 143 potential of less than the maximum contaminant level and local conditions demonstrate that the system is not likely to approach or exceed the maximum contaminant level. If at any time during which the reduced sampling frequency is in effectt the result from any analysis for maximum total trihalomethane potential is equal to or exceeds the maximum contaminant level and such results are confirmed by at least one check samplet the system shall immediately resume sampling on a routine basis of four samples per quarter per treatment plant used by the system. Such increased sampling shall continue for at least one year before the frequency may be reduced again. In the event of any significant change to the systems source of water or treatment programt the system shall immediately analyze an additional sample for maximum total trihalomethane potential taken at a point in the distribution system reflecting maximum residence time of the water in the system for the purpose of determining whether the system must begin sampling on a routine basis of four samples per quarter per treatment plant used by the system. (3) Increased sampling frequency. At the option of the departmentt sampling frequencies may be increased above the minimum in those cases where it is necessary to detect variations of total trihalomethane levels within the distribution system. c. Compliance. Compliance with the maximum contaminant level shall be determined based on a running annual average of quarterly analyses. If the average of analyses covering any twelve-month period exceeds the maximum contaminant levelt sampling shall be at a frequency designated by the department and shall continue until a monitoring schedule as a condition to a variance or enforcement action becomes effective. If the average of analyses covering any twelve-month period exceeds the maximum contaminant levelt or if the system fails to monitort the system shall notify the department and give notice to the public. d. Reporting. All analyses shall be reported to the department within thirty days of the systems receipt of such results. 144 e. Modification of treatment methods for reduction of total trihalomethanes. Before a system makes any significant modification to its existing treatment process for the purpose of achieving compliance with the trihalomethane regulations, the system must submit and obtain department approval of a detailed plan setting forth its proposed modification and those safeguards that it will implement to ensure that the water will not be adversely affected by such modification. Each system shall comply with the provisions set forth in the department-approved plan. At a minimum, the department-approved plan shall require the system modifying its disinfection practice to: (1) Evaluate the water system for sanitary defects and evaluate the source water for biological quality; (2) Evaluate its existing treatment practices and consider improvements that will minimize disinfectant demand and optimize finished water quality throughout the distribution system; (3) Provide baseline water quality survey data of the distribution system as the department may require; (4) Conduct additional monitoring to assure continued maintenance of optimal microbiological quality in finished water; and (5) Demonstrate an active disinfectant residual throughout the distribution system at all times during and after the Coverage.

Waste treatment. The department may require the treatment of a solid waste which may have incompatible characteristics with another solid waste prior to or during codisposal or which may produce a constituent in the wastes laboratory extract or leachate that exceeds twenty percent of a toxicity standard provided by section 33-24-02-14 or ten parts per million polychlorinated biphenols. The department must consider factors such as the site hydrogeological characteristics. toxicity of the waste, anticipated leachate quality, mobility of waste constituents, fate of leachate constituents during 184 migration, potential site capacity, or local uses of waters of the state. 1. Treatment, when performed, must reduce: a. Toxicity of the waste; or b. The mobility of constituents contained in or derived from the waste into leachate; or c. Both the toxicity and mobility. 2. When treatment is required, the generator of the solid waste or the owner or operator of the facility at which the waste would be treated must provide a demonstration of the treatment technology for approval by the department. 3. An owner or operator may propose and demonstrate treatment of solid waste so as to remove or separate toxic materials or constituents from the waste prior to disposal. In evaluating the demonstration, the department shall consider such factors as technical feasibility; the proposed management of the removed or separated waste materials or constituents; the physical, chemical, and biological processes affecting fate and transport; relative degree of removal of the toxic materials or constituents; or the resulting characteristics of the waste or leachate. If the treatment achieves leachate concentrations of constituents in or derived from the remaining waste which are less than the standards of article 33-16, the department may reduce or waive one or more of the criteria of this article which are enumerated in one or more of the following subdivisions: a. The liner or hydraulic barrier. b. The leachate removal system. c. The site efficiency for collection or rejection of precipitation that falls on the landfill. d. The ground water monitoring plan and system. e. The plan of operation. f. The postclosure plan and postclosure period. g. Recordkeeping and reporting.

The sign has any lettering one inch [2.54 centimeters] or more in height or width for each fifty feet [15.24 meters] of distance from the sign to the main-traveled way of a controlled highway, the distance from the sign to the main-traveled way being measured at right angles to the highway at the shortest distance between the sign and the centerline of the main-traveled way nearest the sign. 2. At least eighty percent of the total average daily traffic count of vehicles, as determined by tRe--state---R~\u00a7Rway department counts, on all highways from which the sign is visible is traveling in either or both directions along the main-traveled way of a highway eeAtFe++ea-ay-tR~s-aFt~e+e on the federal-aid primary system. --- 3. The sign is visible from the main-traveled way of the highway for more than five seconds traveling at the posted speed limit, or for the time needed to read the whole message, whichever is less. 4. The sign is placed at an angle that makes it easily visible to traffic on the main-traveled way of the controlled highway. 5. The sign advertises a location not directly accessible from the noncontrolled highway, and is clearly intended for travelers on the main-traveled way of the controlled highway. 277 Unless the context otherwise requires, terms used herein are defined as in 23 CFR, part 750, subpart G.

For purposes of this article a nonconforming sign is one which was lawfully erected, but which does not comply with the provisions of state or federal laws or rules passed at a later date or which later failed to comply with the law or rules due to changed conditions. Illegally erected or maintained signs are not nonconforming signs. 1. Nonconforming grandfathered signs permitted to remain in place pursuant to the January 19, 1972, agreement between the RtgAway--eeffiffitssteReP director and the United States secretary of transportation and pursuant to 23 CFR 750.707, may remain in a commercial or industrial area for their normal life, subject to reasonable maintenance and repair. Any nonconforming grandfathered sign improperly repaired or enlarged with better materials or otherwise maintained in violation of this section is unlawful and sRatt must be removed upon the order of the eeffiffitssteReP---eP---tRe eeffiffitssteReP!s-ageRt director pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 24-17-11. 2. Change of advertising copy is part of reasonable maintenance and repair, but the change of copy may not increase or expand the size of the original nonconforming use. 3. Change of facing or sign display area is part of reasonable maintenance and repair, but the change of facing and sign display area may not increase or expand the size of the original nonconforming use. 4. No nonconforming sign may be substantially altered in any manner which expands or increases the size of the sign in excess of the original nonconforming use. 5. Ne B change may not be made in the number of, type of, or material used for the support of a nonconforming sign, nor in any of its structural members or foundations, in excess of or improving upon the original nonconforming use. 6. Any nonconforming sign destroyed by the elements, taken in condemnation, or abandoned by any previous owner; is an abandoned sign and may not be reconstructed. If the 282 nonconforming sign is only damaged to an extent not greater than fifty percent of the replacement cost of the sign, then it may be repaired to its preexisting size, shape, and type and quality of materials. Replacement cost will be determined by the ee~~ss~eReF!s directors sign cost schedule approved and effective on the date the sign was damaged. 7. A nonconforming sign toppled or blown over by wind or by vandalism may be reerected within one year. Any nonconforming sign not so reerected is abandoned and unlawful, may not be reerected, and s~att must be removed pursuant to the order of the ee~tssteReF-eF-t~e-ee~~ssteReF!s-ageRt director pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 24-17-11. 8. A nonconforming sign that has not displayed advertising copy or display for one year or more is an abandoned sign, is unlawful advertising, and s~att must be removed upon the order of the ee~tss~eReF-eF-t~e-ee~tssteReF!s-ageRt director under North Dakota Century Code section 24-17-11, unless the owner can establish to the satisfaction of the ee~tssteReF--eF--t~e ee~~ssteReFls--ageRt director that the cessation of use was beyond the owners control because it was caused by an act of God. The definition of blank sign in section 37-05-02-04 applies to this subsection for determining lack of advertising copy or display. 9. Ne A sign may not be erected or reconstructed upon the site of an abandoned nonconforming sign, so long as the site continues to be in a nonconforming area. 10. Unless abandoned under this article, a nonconforming sign damaged or destroyed by vandalism or other criminal or tortious act may be reerected in kind, only at its preexisting size and shape, and only with the same type and quality of materials. The burden is on the sign owner to prove to the satisfaction of the ee~tss~eReF-eF-t~e--ee~tssteReF!s--ageRt director that a nonconforming sign has been destroyed by vandals or by other criminal or tortious or unlawful action, rather than by the elements or by lawful action. 11. The requirements of this section apply to any nonconforming sign in existence, whether it became nonconforming before or after the effective date of this section.

Installed signs and structures will be inspected at night for maximum effect and minimum specular reflection. If any sign exhibits specular reflection or is ineffective at night, the sign must be adjusted at the contractors expense. Signs and delineators located less than thirty feet [9.14 meters] from the pavement edge must be erected with the sign face truly vertical and turned ninety-three degrees away from the center and direction of travel of the lane that the facility serves. Signs located thirty feet [9.14 meters] or more from the edge of the pavement edge must be erected with the sign face truly vertical and aligned ninety degrees from the center and direction of travel of the lane that the offset sign serves. Special attention must be given to the location and positioning of signs and delineators at the point where lanes divide, or on curves, to avoid specular reflection and to obtain maximum effectiveness of the facility. b. Sign fabrication. 300 (1) General. All sign backing for flat sheet signs must be aluminum unless noted otherwise, with reflective sheeting applied as specified in this chapter. On large variable message signs the messages, symbols, and borders must consist of directly applied reflective sheeting cut to desired shapes. The message, symbols, and border must be applied as specified by the sheeting manufacturer. (2) Fabrication of sign backing. Sign backings must be cut to size and shape and must be free of buckles, warps, dents, cockles, burrs, and all defects resulting from fabrication. The surface of all signs must be plane surfaces. All cutting, shearing, and drilling or punching of holes (except mounting holes for demountable letters, numerals, symbols, and borders) must be completed before metal degreasing and application of reflective sheeting. (3) Cleaning and processing. Cleaning and processing of sign backing must take place before applying the reflective sheeting. Cleaning and processing must be performed using the sheeting manufacturers instructions and recommendations as well as the requirements of section 894. All metal sign backing material must be handled only by handling devices or clean canvas gloves between cleaning and applying reflective sheeting. Metal must not come in contact with greases, oils, or other contaminants before application of reflective sheeting. When backing materials are chromate-conversion coated beforehand and are allowed to set for several days before applying reflective sheeting, the application surface must be given a solvent wipe before reflective sheeting application. (4) Fabrication of flat sheet signs. The background or message and border must be screened on reflective sheeting as specified by the manufacturer of the reflective material and as specified here. Colors must meet the requirements of the contract and as shown in the MUTCD. Care must be taken so screening inks are compatible with reflective sheeting backgrounds. Reflective material must meet section 894.02. The reflective sheeting used on flat sheet sign backings larger than the manufacturers material must require splicing. All sheeting on one individual 301 sign must be from the same manufacturer1s lot and must be spliced in one direction only. No more than one splice is permitted per sign. Vertical splices must be in the center of the sign. Horizontal splices, if used in lieu of the vertical splice, must be in the center of the sign with the top portion overlapping the bottom portion of the sheeting when it is in the upright position. Heat-activated, adhesive-coated, reflective sheeting may be overlapped not less than three-sixteenths of one inch [4.76 millimeters] or by a butted gap not to exceed one-thirty-second of one inch [0.79 millimeters]. Splices will be permitted only on sign screens processed with transparent colors. Pressure-sensitive, adhesive-coated, reflective sheetings must be overlapped not less of one inch [4.76 millimeters]. The overlapped splice must be made without screening paints between the reflective sheeting. The sign face must be processed and finished with material as specified by the sheeting manufacturer. Processing of type III A or III B reflective sheeting with screened-on messages must be accomplished before applying to the sign backing. Processing of type II reflective sheeting may be accomplished before or after applying to the sign backing. The finished signs must have a smooth, uniform surface. All letters and numbers must be clear cut and sharp. (5} Fabrication of panel signs. The background must be applied to the panels as specified by the reflective sheeting manufacturer. Reflective sheeting must be overlap spliced. The splice must be overlapped not less than three-sixteenths of one inch [4.76 millimeters], and sheeting applied to panels must extend over the edges and down the side legs a minimum of one-sixteenth of one inch [1.59 millimeters]. Splices must be at a ninety degree angle to the length of the panel. The splices must be uniformly and neatly made throughout their entire length. An individual panel may not have more than two splices, and the minimum distance between adjacent splices must be eight feet [2.44 meters]. (6} Date of fabrication. All signs receiving new sign facings must be dated with the month and year fabricated. The date must be placed on the back of 302 the metal backing on the lower corner of the sign near the edge closest to traffic so that it can be read from the ground. The dating layout must consist of one-fourth inch [6.35 millimeters] high numbers on a two and one-fourth inches [57.15 millimeters] long by one and three-fourths inches [44.45 millimeters] high pressure sensitive label. The numbers imprinted on the upper part of the label must be one through twelve, with the last two digits of four consecutive years printed across the bottom (as 92, 93, 94, 95). The month and year of fabrication must be punched out. The label must meet section 894.04. The cost of furnishing, fabricating, and installing labels must be included in the price bid for \"flat sheet for signs type II and III A\", \"panel for signs type II and III A\", \"refacing signs type II and III A\", or \"overlay panel type II and III A\". c. Packaging, labeling, handling, and shipping. Completed signs must be dry before packaging or storing. Packaged signs that become wet before use may not be used. A warning label with instructions designed to prevent damage to the signs must be on the outside of the package, and an additional warning label must be placed in the packages between the first and second sign, before the last sign, and after each five signs in a package. Packaged signs may not be banded and must be stored and shipped on edge. Packaging must be done so that the signs are protected during storage, shipping, and handling. Packaged signs must be slipsheeted using the material and methods recommended by the sheeting manufacturer. \u00b7 Unmounted reflective sheeting may be stacked flat to a maximum height of five inches [127.0 millimeters] for temporary storage. Otherwise, they must be stored on edge. The sheeting on signs may not be exposed to temperatures above one hundred fifty degrees Fahrenheit [65.56 degrees Celsius]. The slipsheeting must be left on the sign face until mounted. Panel signs may be assembled or separated into sections for ease in handling, storing, and shipping. In lieu of packaging, the sign faces may be turned toward each other and fastened together firmly with sufficient spacers to prevent the sign faces from touching. Sign faces that cannot be protected by packaging or fastening face to face must have protective covers placed over them. d. Label (handling, storage, and installation instructions). The label referred to in section 754.03 C must contain the following instructions: 303 (1) Loading on vehicles. Signs must be secured vertically in racks to prevent them from rubbing, scratching, or marring front surfaces. Signs that have protective wrappings or slipsheeting must be kept dry. Signs must be carefully unloaded and stacked on edge off the ground in an upright position. (2) Storage at jobsite. Signs must be stored indoors and upright on edge to prevent damage to the reflective sheeting. Signs must be kept dry. Packaged signs that get wet will be rejected. (3) Installation.

Prior to commencing drilling operations, any person who proposes to drill a well for oil, gas, or injection shall submit to the commission, and obtain its approval, a surety bond or a ~Pe~ePty-eP cash bond in a form approved by the commission, conditioned as provided by law. The operator of such well shall be the principal on the bond covering the well. Each surety bond shall be executed by a responsible surety company authorized to transact business in North Dakota. The bond shall be in the amount of fifteen thousand dollars when applicable to one well only. Wells drilled to a total depth of less than two thousand feet [609.6 meters] may be bonded in a lesser amount if approved by the director. When the principal on the bond is drilling or operating a number of wells within the state or proposes to do so, the principal may submit a blanket bond conditioned as provided aseve Qy law. A blanket bond covering ten wells or less shall be in the amount of fifty thousand dollars. A blanket bond covering all wells, which a person may at any time drill or operate within the state before the bond is released, shall be in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars, provided the bond shall be limited to ten dry holes, and abandoned wells pursuant to section 43-02-03-55 that have not been properly plugged and the sites reclaimed. A well with an approved temporary abandoned status shall have the same status as an oil, gas, or injection well. With regard to cash bonds, the commission may require higher amounts than those referred to in this section. Such additional amounts for cash bonds must be related to the expected cost of plugging and well site reclamation, as determined by the commission. The bond herein required shall be conditioned upon full compliance with North Dakota Century Code chapter 38-08, and all administrative rules and orders of the commission. It shall be a plugging bond, as well as a drilling bond, and is to endure up to and including approved plugging of all oil, gas, and injection wells as well as dry holes. Approved plugging shall also include practical reclamation of the well site, and appurtenances thereto. If the principal does not satisfy the bonds conditions. then the surety shall either satisfy the conditions or forfeit to the commission the face value of the bond. 317 Transfer of property does not release the bond. In case of transfer of property or other interest in the well and the principal desires to be released from the bond covering a the well eF-wetts, such as producers, not ready for plugging, the principar- should proceed as fallows: t~e--~et8eF-ef-t~e-a~~Feve8-~eFffi~t-te-8F~tt;-t~e The principal must notify \u00b7the director, in writing, of all proposed transfers of well at least thirty days before the closing date of the transfer. The director may, for good cause, waive the requirement of at least thirty days' notice prior to transfer. The principal eA-t~e-eeAe; shall notify the commission ~A wF~t~A\u00a7 on a form to be provided by the commission reciting that a certain well, describing each well by its location within the section, township, and range, ~as-eF-~ave-eeeA is to be transferred to a certain transferee, naming such transferee, for the purpose of ownership or operation. s~e~ The date of assignment or transfer must be eatee stated and the form signed by a party duly authorized so to sign. On said transfer form the transferee shall recite the following: \"The transferee has read the foregoing statement and does accept such transfer and does accept the responsibility of such well under the transferee's one-well bond or, as the case may be, does accept the responsibility of such wells under the transferee's blanket bond, said bond being tendered to or on file with the commission.\" Such acceptance must likewise be signed by a party authorized so to sign. When the commission has passed upon the transfer and acceptance . and accepted it under the transferee's bond, the transferor ~s ~ffiffiee~atety shall be released ef-t~e-~t~\u00a7\u00a7~Ag-Fes~eAs~e~t~ty-ef from the responsibility of plugging the well eF-wetts-as-t~e-ease-ffiay-ee 1-aA8--~f and site reclamation. If such wett--eF wells include all the wells within the responsibility of the transferor's bond, such bond will be released upon written notice by the commission to that effect. The transferee of any oil, gas, or injection well eF~ the new operator of any such well~ shall be responsible for the plugging of any such well and for that purpose shall submit a new bond or, in the case of surety bond, produce the written consent of the surety of the original or prior plugging bond that the latter's responsibility shall continue. This section shall apply to transfers of any such wells made prior to the effective date of this section as well as thereafter. The original or prior bond shall not be released as to the plugging responsibility of any such transferor until the transferee shall submit to the commission an acceptable bond to cover such well. All liability on bonds shall continue until the plugging and site reclamation of such weH -eF we 11 s i s camp 1 eted and approved. Prior to the commencement of operations, any person proposing to operate a treating plant must submit to the commission and obtain its 318 approval, of a surety, or cash bond conditioned as provided by law. The person responsible for the operation of the plant shall be the principal on the bond. The amount of the bond must be as prescribed in section 43-82-83-51. It is to remain in force until the operations cease, all equipment removed from the site, and the site reclaimed, or liability of the bond is transferred to another bond that provides the same degree of security. \u00b7 The commission shall, in writing, advise the principal and any sureties on any bond as to whether the plugging and reclamation is approved;--~A--eFSeF--tRat;--~f-tRe-~t~\u00a7\u00a7~A\u00a7-~5. If approved, liability under such bond may be formally terminated. The director is vested with the power to act for the commission as to all matters within this section.

Before any person shall begin any well-site preparation for the drilling of any well other than surveying and staking, such person shall file an application for permit to drill (form 1) with the director, together with a permit fee of one hundred dollars. Verbal approval may be given for site preparation by the director in extenuating circumstances. No drilling activity shall commence until such application is approved and a permit to drill is issued by the director. Permits to drill or recomplete may contain such terms and conditions as the director deems necessary. The application must be accompanied by the bond pursuant to section 43-82-83-15 or the applicant must have previously filed such bond with the commission, otherwise the application is incomplete. An incomplete application received by the commission has no standing and will not be deemed filed until it is completed. The application for permit to drill shall be accompanied by an accurate plat certified by a registered surveyor showing the location of the proposed well with reference to the nearest lines of a governmental section. Information to be included in such application shall be the proposed depth to which the well will be drilled, estimated depth to the top.of important markers, estimated depth to the top of objective horizons, the proposed mud program, the proposed casing program, including size and weight thereof, the depth at which each casing string is to be set, and the proposed amount of cement to be used, including the estimated top of cement. The director may request additional information, if deemed necessary. Prior to the commencement of recompletion operations, an application for permit shall likewise be filed with the director. Included in such application shall be the notice of intention (form 4) to reenter a plugged well, or to develop by deepening or plugging back 319 to any source of supply other than the producing horizon in an existing well. Such notice to recomplete any well shall include the name and file number and exact location of the well, the approximate date operations will begin, the proposed recompletion procedure, the estimated completed total depth, the casing program to be followed, and the original total depth and the total depth at which the well is to be recompleted. The director may request additional information, if deemed necessary. The director shall deny an application for permit to drill if a well drilled in the location applied for would cause, or tend to cause, waste or violate correlative rights. The director of oil and gas shall state in writing to the applicant the reason for the denial of the permit. The applicant may appeal the decision of the director to the corrmission. Unless a well is drilling, or has been drilled, below surface casing on the first anniversary of the date of issuance of the permit for the well, the permit shall in all things terminate and be of no further force and effect. Recompletion operations must commence within one year of the date of approval or permission to recomplete shall terminate and be of no further force and effect.

When any well is drilled or deepened, tests to determine the deviation from the vertical shall be taken at least every one thousand feet [304.8 meters]. When the deviation from the vertical exceeds five degrees at any point, the director may require that the hole be straightened. Directional 323 surveys may be required by the director, whenever, in the director's judgment, the location of the bottom of the well is in doubt. A directional survey shall be made and filed with the director on any well utilizing a whipstock or any method of deviating the well bore in a predetermined direction except to sidetrack junk in the hole, straighten a crooked hole, or to control a blowout. iwe-ee~ies--ef--t~e s~Fvey--m~st-ee-fitea The survey contractor must file a certified survey with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Special permits may be obtained to drill directionally in a predetermined direction as provided above, from the director. If the director denies a request for a permit to directionally drill, the director shall advise the applicant immediately of the reasons for denial. The decision of the director may be appealed to the commission. History: Amended effective April 1, 1980; April 30, 1981; January 1, 1983; May 1, 1990; May 1, 1992; 38-08-04 43-02-03-31.

Within thirty days after the completion of a well, or recompletion of a well in a different pool, a completion report (form 6) shall be filed with the director, except a completion report shall be filed immediately after the completion or recompletion of a well in a pool or reservoir not then covered by an order of the commission. In no case shall oil or gas be transported from the lease prior to the filing of a completion report unless approved by the director. The operator shall cause to be run an electrical, radioactivity, or other similar log, or combination of logs, of the operator's choice, from which formation tops and porosity zones can be determined. The obligation to log may be waived by the director or other representative if hole conditions preclude the feasibility of such logging operation or if the well is a replacement well. s~e~ The operator shall cause to be run a log from which the presence of cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set. The obligation to log may be waived by the director if the necessity therefor can be demonstrated to the director's satisfaction. Waiver will be contingent upon such terms and conditions as the director deems appropriate. All logs run shall be available to the director at the well site prior to proceeding with plugging or completion operations. Within thirty days after completion, two copies of all logs and surveys run shall be submitted to the director free of charge. However, if the director finds that the directional survey of a well is needed for the timely conduct of business, the director may require the filing of the survey immediately after completion. In 324 addition, operators shall file two copies of drill stem test reports and charts, formation water analyses, porosity, permeability or fluid saturations, core analyses, and noninterpretive lithologic logs or sample descriptions if compiled by the operator. All information furnished to the director shall be kept confidential for not more than six months if requested by the operator in writing. The six-month period must commence on the date the well is completed or the date the written request is received, whichever is earlier. If the written request accompanies the application for permit to drill or is filed after permitting but prior to spudding, the six-month period will commence on the date the well is spudded. Approval must be obtained from the director prior to perforating or recompleting a well in a reservoir other than the reservoir in which the well was originally completed. Upon the completion, recompletion of a well, the completion of any remedial work, or attempted remedial work such as plugging back or drilling deeper, acidizing, shooting, formation fracturing, squeezing operations, setting liner, perforating, reperforating, or other similar operations not specifically covered herein, a report on the operation shall be filed on a sundry notice (form 4) with the director. The report shall present a detailed account of all work done and the date of such work; the daily production of oil, gas, and water both prior to and after the operation; the size and depth of perforations; the quantity of sand, crude, chemical, or other materials employed in the operation; and any other pertinent information or operations which affect the original status of the well and are not specifically covered herein. Upon the initial installation of pumping equipment, or change in type of pumping equipment designed to increase productivity in a well, the operator shall submit a sundry notice (form 4) of such installation. The notice shall include all pertinent information on the pump and the operation thereof including the date of such installation, and the daily production of the well prior to and after the pump has been installed shall also be included.

Statement of intent. North Dakota Century Code chapter 43-12.1 allows the licensed nurse to delegate and supervise nursing tasks and nursing functions to individuals authorized by the board to perform those functions. Included in nursing tasks and nursing functions is the provision for the delivery of routine, regularly scheduled medications that in certain settings can safely be done by a nurse assistant with appropriate training and supervision. While the management of the medication regimen is the responsibility of licensed nurses and requires the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the licensed nurse to ensure public safety and accountability, nurse assistants with advanced prescribed training may perform the task of giving or applying certain medications to the patient in specific settings when such medications do not require determination of need, drug calculation, or dosage conversion as long as the licensed nurse is available to monitor the patient1S progress and effectiveness of the prescribed medication regimen. Individuals to whom the task of giving the routine, regularly scheduled medication is ,delegated must complete a prescribed training program. The delivery of routine, regularly scheduled medications in acute care settings or settings where the patient population includes individuals with unstable or changing nursing care needs is specifically precluded by these rules.

History: Effective September 1, Implemented: NDCC 43-23-05 79-92-93-15. Agency disclosure required. In all real estate transactions the licensee is the agent of the seller unless all parties otherwise agree in writing. The agency relationship must be disclosed in writing to the parties before the signing of a written contractual agreement. The disclosure language must state at least the following information in substantially this form: 11I ------..,-.-----..,-:---- a real estate licensee, stipulate that I am representing the (Buyer/Seller) in this transaction. Licensee .. Each licensee in the transaction shall make such a disclosure. This section applies only to transactions involving agricultural and commercial property, residential property that provides separate dwelling units for five or more families, and commercial leaseholds.

As used in this section, unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires: 422 a. 11Dual agency11 means a situation in which a licensee owes a duty to more than one party to the real estate transaction. Dual agency is established as follows: (1) When one licensee represents both the buyer and the seller in a real estate transaction; or (2) When two or more licensees, licensed to the same broker, each represent a party to the real estate transaction. b. 11Party to the real estate transaction.. includes any individual or individuals who are a seller or buyer, or potential seller or buyer. c. 11Real estate transaction .. means any transaction involving residential real property that consists of separate dwelling units for one through four families. \"Real estate transaction\" does not include transactions involving agricultural or commercial property, residential property that provides separate dwelling units for five or more families, or commercial leaseholds. 2. In all real estate transactions in which the licensee represents any party to a real estate transaction, the licensee must make an affirmative written disclosure identifying which party that person represents in the transaction. The disclosure must be made at the time of the first substantive contact between the licensee and any party to the real estate transaction. The disclosure must be represented by a separate written document, and offered to the party to the real estate transaction for signature. True copies of the disclosure form must be retained in the brokers file. As used in this subsection, the term 11Substantive contact .. means: a. When representing the seller, prior to the signing of a listing agreement. b. When representing a buyer, prior to the signing of a buyers broker agreement. c. As to all other parties, such as potential buyers or sellers, who are not represented by the licensee, prior to the discussion of personal financial information or the commencement of negotiations, which could affect that partys bargaining position in the transaction. However, a licensee shall have complied with the provisions of this subsection if, in those circumstances where it is impossible as a practical matter to obtain a signed written disclosure statement from a party at the time of the first substantive contact, such as telephone contact with an absent party, the licensee orally discloses the 423 status of the licensees representation and, as soon as practicable thereafter, makes the written disclosure required by this subsection. d. As to any change in the licensees representation, including dual agency, that makes the initial disclosure of representation incomplete, misleading, or inaccurate, a new disclosure must be made at once to any party to the transaction. e. Nothing in this section requires written notice to each prospective buyer who comes to an open house display of real property; provided, however, the licensee, by sign, poster, distributed listing literature, or property description form, conspicuously discloses the licensees agency relationship. 3. Each licensee owes a duty of confidentiality to a party being represented in a real estate transaction. The following information may not be disclosed without the informed, written consent of the party being represented: a. That the party being represented is willing to pay more than the purchase price or lease price offered for the property. b. That the party being represented is willing to accept less than the purchase price or lease price being asked for the property. c. What the motivating factors are for the buying, selling, or leasing of the property by the party being represented. d. That the party being represented will agree to terms for financing of the property other than those which are offered. 4. A licensee shall also keep confidential all information received from a party being represented, which has been made confidential by request or instruction of that party. 5. The obligation of confidentiality set forth in subsections 3 and 4 continues in effect during the time a party is being actively represented, and continues on after the termination, expiration, or completion of the representation until one of the following occurs: a. The party being represented permits the disclosure by subsequent word or conduct. b. Disclosure is required by law, by court order, or order of the commission. 424 c. The information is made public through disclosure from a source other than the licensee. 6. The provisions of subsections 3 and 4 do not serve to permit or require a licensee to keep confidential any material defects in the property of which the licensee is aware or which would constitute fraudulent misrepresentation unless disclosed. 7. The written disclosure required by this section must advise a party to the real estate transaction of the different types of representation that are available. The explanation must include information pertaining to how that party's interest shall be represented if the party chooses the licensee to act as the owner's agent, the buyer's agent, or as a dual agent. The written disclosure forms, in clearly understood terms, must inform the party to the transaction as follows: a. If the party chooses seller representation, it must be explained that this relationship typically arises from entering into a listing agreement, or by agreeing to act as a subagent through the listing agency. A subagent may work in a different real estate office. A listing agent or subagent can assist the buyer but does not represent that party. A listing agent or subagent is required to place the interest of the owner first. and a buyer should not tell a listing agent or subagent anything that the buyer would not want the owner to know, because the listing agent or subagent must disclose any material information to the owner. b. If the party chooses buyer representation. it must be explained that the licensee typically becomes the buyer's agent by entering into an agreement for such representation. A buyer's agent may assist the owner but does not represent the owner. A buyer's agent must place the interest of the buyer first, and the owner should not tell a buyer's agent anything the owner would not want the buyer to know because the buyer's agent must disclose any material information to the buyer. c. If the party selects dual agency, it must be explained that the licensee must enter into a written agreement obtaining the consent of both parties before such representation is authorized. This agreement must set forth who will be responsible for paying the licensee's fee. Under this arrangement, the licensee is required to treat both parties honestly and impartially so as not to favor one over the other. Unless written permission from the appropriate party is obtained, the licensee is prohibited from disclosing that the owner will accept less than the asking price, that the buyer will pay a price greater than that submitted in the written offer, or any 425 other information of a confidential nature or which the party has instructed the licensee not to disclose. Potential conflicts exist when the licensee represents more than one party, and the licensees activities may be more limited. The licensee is required to inform each party of any facts that would affect a partys decision to permit representation of both the owner and buyer. This includes any arrangement by which the licensee will or expects to represent a party in a future transaction. d. That a duty of loyalty and faithfulness are owed to the party or parties to the transaction with whom the licensee has an agency relationship, and the licensee must inform that party of all important information which might affect a decision concerning the real estate transaction. This includes disclosure of any material facts to the buyer that may adversely and significantly affect that persons use or enjoyment of the property. It also includes disclosure of any information to either party which may indicate that one of the parties may not perform in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement or any other written agreement or obligation. e. No licensee may deal unfairly with any party to a real estate transaction, regardless of whether the party is represented by that licensee. 8. No person required to be licensed by North Dakota Century Code chapter 43-23 may maintain any action to recover any commission, fee, or other compensation with respect to the purchase, sale, lease, or other disposition or conveyance of real property, or with respect to the offer, negotiation, or attempt to negotiate any sale, lease, purchase, or other disposition, unless that persons agency relationship has been disclosed to the party or parties to the transaction in accordance with the requirements of this section. 9. The commission may approve a specific form or forms to implement the provisions of this section. History: Effective September 1, 1994.

History: Effective July 1, Implemented: NDCC 39-03.1-11(5), 75 Department of Human Services 467 468 MAY 1994 CHAPTER 75-82-82 AGENCY SYNOPSIS: Regarding proposed amendments to North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-02-02, Medical Services. A public hearing was conducted on November 3, 1993, concerning proposed amendments to North Dakota Administrative Code, chapter 75-02-02, Medical Services, specifically adding a new subsection 6 to section 75-02-02-08, Amount, Duration, and Scope of Medical Assistance, concerning the implementation of managed care requirements for certain Medicaid recipients. The amendments to section 75-02-02-08 were adopted as interim final rules effective July 1, 1994. Emergency rulemaking was necessary because a delay in rulemaking was likely to cause a loss of federal revenues appropriated to support the administration of the Medicaid program, a duty imposed upon the Department of Human Services by North Dakota Century Code section 50-06-05.1 and North Dakota Century Code chapter 50-24.1, if the effective date of the amendment was May 1, 1994, as would be likely if diligent nonemergency rulemaking was pursued. During the period before the effective date, the unamended rule would not conform to the requirements of a waiver issued by the Health Care Financing Administration, a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(b)(1), of requirements imposed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Chapter 7, Subchapter XIX, which requires the state of North Dakota to operate a primary care case management program beginning January 1, 1994. If the department did not conform the Medicaid program to this federal requirement, it may not lawfully claim federal funds otherwise available to provide Medicaid benefits for the period beginning January 1, 1994, and ending May 1, 1994. 469 Section 75-02-02-08(6}: Adds a new subsection 6 to implement managed care requirements for families and children receiving Medicaid benefits, but not to persons who are over age 65, blind, or disabled, and requires a recipient to identify a particular physician as a primary care physician. 75-92-92-98.

A public hearing was conducted on November 3, 1993, concerning proposed amendments to North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-02-02.1, Eligibility for Medicaid, concerning covered groups, spousal impoverishment prevention, trusts, and disqualifying transfers. The amendments to section 75-02-02.1-05(1)(j) were adopted as interim final rules effective January 1, 1994. The remaining amendments to chapter 75-02-02.1 were adopted as interim final rules effective October 1, 1993. Emergency rulemaking was necessary because a delay in rulemaking was likely to cause a loss of federal revenues appropriated to support the administration of the Medicaid program, a duty imposed upon \u00b7the Department of Human Services by North Dakota Century Code section 50-06-05.1 and North Dakota Century Code chapter 50-24.1, if the effective date of the amendment was May 1, 1994, as would be likely if diligent nonemergency rulemaking was pursued. During the period before the effective dates, the remaining unamended rules would not conform to 42 U.S.C. section 1396p, as amended by section 13611 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1994, effective October 1, 1993, which requires states administering Medicaid programs to apply certain procedures and requirements concerning the transfers of assets made after August 1, 1993, and the treatment of certain trusts established after August 10, 1993, to all Medicaid eligibility determinations made on or after October 1, 1993. If the department did not conform the Medicaid program to this federal requirement, it may not lawfully claim federal funds otherwise available to provide Medicaid benefits. 75-02-02.1-05(1)(j): Describes a newly covered group of qualified family members. 75-02-02.1-24, Spousal Impoverishment Prevention: Describes the showing required of a community spouse who seeks an asset allowance in excess of the community spouse countable asset allowance. 75-02-02.1-31, Trusts: Provides that the section applies to any trust not subject to section 75-02-02.1-31.1. 75-02-02.1-31.1, Trusts Established by Applicants. Recipients. or Their Spouses After August 10, 1993: A new section which describes the Medicaid eligibility treatment of trusts established by applicants, recipients, or their spouses after August 10, 1993. 75-02-02.1-33.

(2) A transfer under paragraph 1 must be made by the end of the third calendar month after the month in which the eligibility decision is made. (3) When an eligible institutionalized spouse exceeds the asset limits due to an increase in the value of assets or the receipt of assets not previously owned, an institutionalized spouse may transfer additional assets to the community spouse equal to no more than the current maximum community spouse countable asset allowance less the total value of assets transferred to, or for the sole benefit of, the community spouse, under paragraph 1 or previously transferred under this paragraph. (4) A transfer under paragraph 3 must be made by the end of the third calendar month of a period which begins with the month in which the institutionalized spouse exceeded the asset limit. (5) If a transfer made under paragraph 1 or 3 causes the total value of all assets owned by the community spouse immediately prior to the transfer under paragraph 1, plus the value of all assets transferred 497 under paragraph 1, plus the value of all assets transferred under paragraph 3, equals or exceeds the current maximum community spouse asset allowance, no further transfer may be made under paragraph 3. (6) If a court has entered an order against an institutionalized spouse for the support of a community spouse, assets required by such order to be transferred, by the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse, may not be counted as available to the institutionalized spouse even though the assets are not yet transferred. 3.

Two or more properties may be excluded if each such property produces at least a six percent return and the combined equity value does not exceed six thousand dollars. Equity in such property is a countable asset to the extent that equity exceeds six thousand dollars and is a countable asset if it produces an annual return of less than six percent of equity. The property must be in current use, or, if not in current use, there must be a reasonable expectation that the use will resume, and the annual return test will be met within twelve months of the last use or, if the nonuse is due to the disabling condition of the community spouse or the institutionalized spouse, within twenty-four months of the last use.

The notice must be provided, upon a determination of medicaid eligibility of an institutionalized spouse, to both spouses, and upon a subsequent request by either spouse or a representative acting on behalf of either spouse, to the spouse making the request. 503 b. Fair hearing. A community spouse or an institutionalized spouse is entitled to a fair hearing under chapter 75-01-03 if application for medicaid has been made on behalf of the institutionalized spouse and either spouse is dissatisfied with a determination of: (1) The community spouse monthly income allowance; (2) The amount of monthly income otherwise available to the community spouse as determined in calculating the community spouse monthly income allowance; (3) The computation of the spousal share of countable assets; (4) The attribution of countable assets; or (5) The determination of the community spouse countable asset allowance. c. Any hearing respecting the determination of the community spouse countable asset allowance must be held within thirty days of the request for the hearing. d. If either spouse establishes that the community spouse needs income, above the level provided by the monthly maintenance needs allowance, due to exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress, the monthly maintenance needs allowance for that spouse must be increased to an amount adequate to provide necessary additional income. e. ill If either spouse establishes that the assets included within the community spouse countable asset allowance generate an amount of income inadequate to raise the community spouses income to the monthly needs allowance, to the extent that total assets permit~ the community spouse countable asset allowance feF tAat--s~e~se must be increased to an amount adequate to provide such a monthly maintenance needs allowance. (2) To establish a need for an increased asset allowance under this subdivision, the applicant or recipient must: (a) Provide verification of all income and assets of the community spouse; and (b) Provide three estimates of the cost of the annuity described in paragraph 3. 504 (3) The amount of assets adequate to provide a monthly maintenance needs allowance for the community spouse must be based on the cost of a single premium lifetime annuity that provides monthly payments equal to the difference between the monthly maintenance needs allowance and other income of both spouses not generated by either spouses nonexempt assets.

The income that may be received by or deemed provided to an ineligible community spouse, and the asset amounts that an ineligible community spouse may retain, are intended to allow that community spouse to avoid impoverishment. They are not intended to allow the community spouse to make transfers of assets or income, for less than adequate consideration, which would disqualify the institutionalized spouse, if made by the institutionalized spouse. History: Effective December 1, 1991; amended effective December 1, 1991; July 1, 1993; October Trusts. A trust is an arrangement whereby a person (the \"grantor\" or \"trustor\") gives property to another (the \"trustee\") with instructions to use the property for the benefit of a third person (the \"beneficiary\"). The property placed in trust is 505 called the 11principal11 or 11Corpus11 The positions of grantor, trustee, and beneficiary occur in all trusts, but it is not uncommon for a single trust to involve more than one grantor, trustee, or beneficiary. It is also not uncommon for a grantor to establish a trust where the grantor is also a beneficiary or where the trustee is also a beneficiary. Trusts are often very individualized arrangements, and generalizations about them can prove inaccurate. However, the trust may have an effect on eligibility whether the applicant is a grantor, trustee, or beneficiary. 1. Revocable -irrevocable. Trusts may be categorized in many ways, but the revocability of a trust is a fundamental one. A revocable trust is one where someone, usually the grantor, has the power to remove the property from the trust, or otherwise end the trust. An irrevocable trust is one where that power does not exist. The determination of trust revocability is not based solely on a trust declaration of irrevocability. A trust where a power to amend is reserved to the grantor, or granted\u00b7to some other person, is treated as a revocable trust. Even a trust which, on its face, appears clearly to be irrevocable, may be revoked with the consent of the grantor and the beneficiaries. a. If the grantor of a trust is also the sole beneficiary, trust assets are treated as the grantors assets for medicaid purposes. b. If the grantor of a trust and all trust beneficiaries are part of a medicaid unit, trust assets are treated as the grantors assets for medicaid purposes. c. Trust assets of a revocable trust are treated as the grantors assets for medicaid purposes. d. The amount from an actually irrevocable trust deemed available to a beneficiary of that trust is the greater of the amount which must be distributed to the beneficiary under the terms of the trust, whether or not that amount is actually distributed, and the amount which is actually distributed (unless the trust is a medicaid-qualifying trust or a support trust). 2. Medicaid-qualifying trusts. a. For purposes of this subsection: (1) 11Medi cai d-qual i fyi ng trust 11 means a trust established, other than by will, by an individual or the individual s spouse, under which the individual may be the beneficiary of all or part of the payments from the trust, and the distribution of such payments is determined by one or more trustees who are 506 permitted to exercise any discretion with respect to the distribution to the individual. (2) 11A trust established by an individual or the individual s spouse.. includes trusts created or approved by courts or by the individual or the individual s spouse where the property placed in trust is intended to satisfy or settle a claim made by or on behalf of the individual or the individual s spouse against any third party. b. The amount from an irrevocable medicaid-qualifying trust deemed available to the grantor or the grantor's spouse is the maximum amount of payments that may be permitted under the terms of the trust to be distributed to the grantor, assuming the full exercise of discretion by the trustee or trustees for the distribution of the maximum amount to the grantor. For purposes of this subdivision, 11grantor11 means the individual referred to in paragraph 1 of subdivision a. c. This subsection applies: (1) Even though the medicaid-qualifying trust is irrevocable or is established for purposes other than to enable a grantor to qualify for medicaid; and (2) Whether or not the discretion described in paragraph 1 of subdivision a is actually exercised. 3. Support trust. a. For purposes of this subsection, 11SUpport trust11 means a trust which has, as a purpose, the provision of support or care to a beneficiary. The purpose of a support trust is indicated by language such as 11to provide for the care, support, and maintenance of . . .11; 11to provide as necessary for the support of ... 11; or 11as my trustee may deem necessary for the support, maintenance, medical expenses, care, comfort, and general welfare11 No particular language js necessary, but words such as 11Care11, 11maintenance11, 11medical needS11, or 11SUpport11 are usually present. The term includes trusts which may also be called .. discretionary support trusts .. or .. discretionary trusts .. , so long as support is a trust purpose. This subsection applies without regard to: (1) Whether or not the support trust is irrevocable or is established for purposes other than to enable a beneficiary to qualify for medicaid or any other benefit program where availability of benefits requires the establishment of financial need; or 507 (2) Whether or not the discretion is actually exercised. b. Except as provided in subdivisions c and d, the amount from a support trust deemed available to the beneficiary, the beneficiarys spouse, and the beneficiarys children is the maximum amount of payments that may be permitted under the terms of the trust to be distributed to the beneficiary, assuming the full exercise of discretion by the trustee or trustees for the distribution of the maximum amount to the beneficiary. c. A beneficiary of a support trust, under which the distribution of payments to the beneficiary is determined by one or more trustees who are permitted to exercise any discretion with respect to that distribution, may show that the amounts deemed available under subdivision bare not actually available by: (1) Commencing proceedings against the trustee or trustees in a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) Diligently and in good faith asserted in the proceeding that the trustee or trustees is required to provide support out of the trust; and (3) Showing that the court has made a determination, not reasonably subject to appeal, that the trustee must pay some amount less than the amount determined under subdivision b. d. If the beneficiary makes the showing described in subdivision c, the amount deemed available from the trust is the amount determined by the court. e. Any action by a beneficiary or the beneficiarys representative, or by the trustee or the trustees representative, in attempting a showing under subdivision c, to make the department, the state of North Dakota, or a county agency a party to the proceeding, or to show to the court that medicaid benefits may be available if the court limits the amounts deemed available under the trust, precludes the showing of good faith required under subdivision c. 4. Discretionary trusts. a. For purposes of this subsection, 11discretionary trust11 means any trust in which one or more trustees is permitted to exercise any discretion with respect to distribution to the beneficiary, but does not include any trust within the definition of a 11Support trust .. , as that term is defined in subsection 3. sea 8.

In the case of a revocable trust: (1) The corpus of the trust shall be considered assets available to the individual; (2) Payments from the trust to or for the benefit of the individual shall be considered income of the individual; and (3) Any other payments from the trust shall be considered income or assets disposed of by the individual for purposes of section 75-02-02.1-33.1. b. In the case of an irrevocable trust: (1) If there are any circumstances under which payment from the trust could be made to or for the benefit of the individual, the portion of the corpus from which, or the income on the corpus from which, payment to the individual could be made shall be considered available to the individual, and payments from that portion of the corpus or income: (a) To or for the benefit of the individual, shall be considered income of the individual; and (b) For any other purpose, shall be considered a transfer of income or assets by the individual subject to section 75-02-02.1-33.1; and (2) Any portion of the trust from which, or any income on the corpus from which, no payment could under any circumstances be made to the individual shall be considered as of the date of establishment of the trust or if later the date on which a ent to the individual was foreclosed to be income or assets disposed by the individual for purposes of section 75-02-02.1-33.1, and the value of the trust shall be determined for purposes of section 75-02-02.1-33.1 by including the amount of any payments made from such portion of the trust after such date. 4. This section shall not apply to: a. A trust containing the assets of an individual under age sixty-five who is disabled and which is established for the benefit of such individual by a parent, grandparent, legal guardian of the individual, or a court if, under the terms of the trust, the department will receive all amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of such 511 individual up to an amount equal to the total medicaid benefits paid under North Dakota Century Code chapter 58-24.1 on behalf of the individual; or b.

The department may waive application of this section if the individual establishes that some other person, not currently rece1v1ng medicaid, food stamps, aid to families with dependent children, or low-income home energy assistance program benefits, would become eligible for such benefits because of and upon application of this section, and that the cost of those benefits, provided to that other person, exceeds the cost of medicaid benefits available to the individual if application is waived. 6.

There is a presumption that a transfer for less than adequate consideration was made for purposes which include the purpose of qualifying for medicaid: (1) In any case in which the person's assets remaining after the transfer produce income which, when added to other income available to the person, totals an amount insufficient to meet all living expenses and medical costs reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the month of transfer and in the twenty-nine months following the month of the transfer; (2) In any case in which an a~~+~eat~eA-eF inquiry about medicaid benefits was made by or on behalf of the person aAa-tRe-~Aa~v~aYa+-mak~Ag-~A~Y~Fy-was-~Afe~ea ef-mea~ea~a-asset-+~m~tst-eF, to any other person, before the date of the transfer; (3) In any case in which the person was an applicant for or recipient of medicaid at-tRe-t~me-tRe-tFaAsfeF-was maae~ before the date of the transfer; (4) In any case in which a transfer is made by or on behalf of the person's spouse, if the value of the transferred asset, when added to the value of the person's other assets, exceeds asset limits; or (5) In any case in which the transfer was made, on behalf of the person or the person's spouse, by a guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact, to the guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact or to any spouse, child, grandchild, brother, sister, niece, nephew, parent, or grandparent, by birth, adoption, or marriage, of the guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact. h.

General 75-92-99 AGENCY SYNOPSIS: Regarding proposed new North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-02-09, Ratesetting for Accredited Residential Treatment Centers for Children. A public hearing was conducted on November 3, 1993, concerning proposed new North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-02-09, Ratesetting for Accredited Residential Treatment Centers for Children. The proposed new chapter establishes, in 18 sections, a ratesetting methodology. The methodology requires the facility to file an annual report of its costs. Those costs are used to project the costs likely to be incurred in the rate year. Adjustments are made to recognize anticipated inflation of costs. Costs may be disallowed if they are not related to providing care, and for other reasons specified in the rules. Recordkeeping requirements are imposed and provision is made for a facility to appeal a rate decision if it is dissatisfied.

The center shall maintain on the premises census records and financial information sufficient to provide for a proper audit or review. For any cost being claimed on the cost report, sufficient data must be available as of the audit date to fully support the report item. b. If several centers are associated with a group and their accounting and reports are centrally prepared, added information must be submitted for those items known to be lacking support at the reporting center prior to the audit or review of the center. Accounting or financial information regarding a related organization must be readily available to substantiate cost. c. Each center shall maintain, until any rate based upon a cost report is final and not subject to any appeal, but in 526 any event, for a period of not less than three years following the date of submission of the cost report to the state agency, accurate financial and statistical records of the period covered by the cost report in sufficient detail to substantiate the cost data reported. Each center shall make the records available upon reasonable demand to representatives of the department. 2. Accounting and reporting requirements. a. The accrual basis of accounting, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, must be used for cost reporting purposes. Ratesetting procedures will prevail if conflicts occur between ratesetting procedures and generally accepted accounting principles. A center may maintain its accounting records on a cash basis during the year, but adjustments must be made to reflect proper accrual accounting procedures at yearend and when subsequently reported. b. To properly facilitate auditing, the accounting system should be maintained in a manner that will allow cost accounts to be grouped by cost category and readily traceable to the cost report. c. The cost report must be submitted on or before the last day of the third month following the center's fiscal yearend. The report must contain all actual costs of the provider, adjustments for nonallowable costs, and resident days. d. The department may impose a nonrefundable penalty of ten percent of any amount claimed for services furnished after the due date if the center fails to file the cost report on or before the due date. The penalty may be imposed on the first day of the fourth month following the center's fiscal yearend and continues to the end of the month in which the statement or report is received. e. Upon request, the following information must be made available: (1) A statement of ownership including the name, address, and proportion of ownership of each owner; (2) Copies of leases, purchase agreements, appraisals, financing arrangements, and other documents related to the lease or purchase of the center or a certification that the content of those documents remains unchanged since the most recent statement given pursuant to this subsection; 527 (3) Supplemental information reconciling the costs on the financial statements with costs on the cost report; or (4) Copies of leases, purchase agreements, and other documents related to the acquisition of equipment, goods, and services claimed as allowable costs. f. The center must make all adjustments and allocations necessary to arrive at allowable costs. The department may reject any cost report when the information filed is incomplete or inaccurate. If a cost report is rejected, the department may impose the penalties described in subdivision d. g. The department may grant an extension of the reporting deadline to a center. To receive an extension, a center must submit a written request to the departments medical services division. 3. The department will perform an audit of the latest available report year of each center at least once every six years and retain for at least three years all audit-related documents, including cost reports, working papers, and internal reports on rate calculations used and generated by audit staff in the performance of audits and in the establishment of rates. Audits must meet generally accepted governmental auditing standards. 4. Penalties for false reports. a. A false report is one where a center knowingly supplies inaccurate or false information in a required report that results in an overpayment. If a false report is received, the department may: (1) Immediately adjust the centers payment rate to recover the entire overpayment within the rate year; (2) Terminate the departments agreement with the center; (3) Prosecute under applicable state or federal law; or (4) Use any combination of the foregoing actions. b. The department may determine a report is a false report if a center claims previously adjusted costs as allowable costs. Previously adjusted costs being appealed must be identified as nonallowable costs. The center may indicate 528 that the costs are under appeal and not claimed under protest to perfect a claim should the appeal be successful. History: Effective May 1, 1994. General Authority: NDCC 50-24.1-04 Law Implemented: 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A) 75-92-99-93. principles. 1. For ratesetting purposes, a cost must: a. Be ordinary, necessary, and related to resident care; b. Be no more than an amount a prudent and cost-conscious business person would pay for the specific good or service in the open market in an arm1s-length transaction; and c. Be for goods or services actually provided in the center. 2. The cost effects of transactions which circumvent these rules are not allowable under the principle that the substance of the transaction prevails over the form. 3. Reasonable resident-related costs will be determined in accordance with the ratesetting procedures set forth in this chapter and instructions issued by the department. History: Effective May 1, 1994. General 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A) 75-92-99-94. The established rate is based on prospective ratesetting procedures. The establishment of a rate begins with historical costs. Adjustments are then made for claimed costs not includable in allowable costs. Adjustment factors are then applied to allowable costs. No retroactive settlements for actual costs incurred during the rate year exceeding the final rate will be made unless specifically provided for in this chapter. 2. The department will establish a desk rate, based on the cost report, which will be effective the first day of the seventh month following the center1S fiscal yearend. a. The desk rate will continue in effect until a final rate is established. 529 b. The cost report will be reviewed taking into consideration the prior year's adjustments. Centers will be notified by telephone or mail of any desk adjustments based on the desk review. Within seven working days after notification, the center may submit information to explain why a desk adjustment should not be made. The department will review the submitted information, make appropriate adjustments, including adjustment factors, and issue the desk rate. c. No reconsideration will be given by the department for the desk rate unless the center has been notified that the desk rate is the final rate. d. A desk rate may be adjusted at any time if subsection 4 applies to the center. 3. The cost report may be field audited to establish a final rate. If no field audit is performed, the desk rate will become the final rate upon notification to the center from the department. a. The final rate will be effective beginning the first day of the seventh month following the center's fiscal yearend. b. The final rate will include any adjustments for nonallowable costs, errors, or omissions that result in a change from the desk rate of at least twenty-five cents per day. c. Adjustments, errors, or omissions found after a final rate has been established will be included as an adjustment in the report year the adjustments, errors, or omissions are found. d. The final rate may be adjusted at any time if subsection 4 applies. 4. Special rates will be established for centers providing services for the first time, whose rates were established under chapter 75-03-20 prior to accreditation, changing ownership, having a capacity increase or major renovation or construction, or having changes in services or staff. a. The rate for a center providing first-time services purchased by the department will be established using this subdivision for the first two fiscal years of the center if that period is less than twenty-four months. (1) The center shall submit a budget, to the department's medical services division, for the first twelve months of operation. A final rate based on the 530 budget and adjustments, if any, will be established for a rate period beginning on the first of the month in which the center begins operation. This rate will remain in effect for eighteen months. No adjustment factors will be included in the first year final rate. No retroactive settlements will be made. (2) Upon completion\u00b7 of the first twelve months of operation, the center must submit a cost report for the twelve-month period regardless of the fiscal yearend of the center. (a) The twelve-month cost report is due on or before the last day of the third month following the end of the twelve-month period. (b) The twelve-month cost report will be used to establish a rate for the remainder of the second rate year. Appropriate adjustment factors will be used to establish the rate. (3) The center shall submit a cost report that will be used to establish rates in accordance with subsections 2 and 3 after the center has been in operation for the entire twelve months of the center's fiscal year. b. Centers receiving accreditation by the joint commission on accreditation for hospitals and which had a desk or final rate established\u00b7 under chapter 75-03-20 prior to the accreditation will receive a rate established based on the cost report submitted under chapter 75-03-20, and the provisions of this chapter. c. For centers changing ownership, the rate established for the previous owner will be retained until the end of the rate year in which the change occurred. The rate for the second rate year after a change in ownership occurs will be established as follows: (1) For a center with four or more months of operation under the new ownership during the report year, a cost report for the period since the ownership change occurred will be used to establish the rate for the next rate year; and (2) For a center with less than four months of operation under the new ownership in the reporting year, the prior report year's costs as adjusted for the previous owner will be indexed forward using appropriate adjustments. 531 d. For centers that increase licensed capacity by twenty percent or more or have renovation or construction projects in excess of fifty thousand dollars, the desk or final rate established for the period after the licensed increase occurs or the construction or renovation is complete may be adjusted to include projected property costs. \u00b7 (1) For the rate year in which the capacity increase occurs or construction or renovation is completed, an adjusted rate will be calculated based on a rate for historical costs, exclusive of property costs, as adjusted, divided by historical census, plus a rate for property costs based on projected property costs divided by projected census. The adjusted rate will be effective on the first day of the month in which the renovation or construction is complete or when the capacity increase is approved if no construction or renovation is necessary. (2) For the rate year immediately following the rate year in which the capacity increase occurred or construction and renovation was completed, a rate will be established based on historical costs, exclusive of property costs, as adjusted for the report year, divided by reported census plus a rate for property costs, based on projected property costs, divided by projected census. e. The department may provide for an increase in the established rate for additional costs necessary to add services or staff to the existing program. (1) The center must submit information, to the departments medical services division, supporting the request for the increase in the rate. Information must include a detailed listing of new or additional staff or costs associated with the increase in services. (2) The department will review the submitted information and may request additional documentation or conduct onsite visits. The established rate will be adjusted if an increase in costs is approved. The effective date of the rate increase will be the later of the first day of the month following approval by the department or the first day of the month following the addition of services or staff. The adjustment will not be retroactive to the beginning of the rate year and will exclude adjustment factors provided for in subsection 8. 532 (3) For the rate year immediately following a rate year in which a rate was adjusted under paragraph 2, the center may request consideration be given to additional costs. The center must demonstrate to the department's satisfaction that historical costs do not reflect twelve months of actual costs of the additional staff or added services in order to adjust the rate for the second rate year. The additional costs would be based on a projection of costs for the remainder of a twelve-month period, exclusive of adjustment factors provided for in subsection 8. 5. The final rate must be considered as payment for all accommodations that include items identified in section 75-02-09-06. For any resident whose rate is paid in whole or in part by the department, no payment may be solicited or received from the resident or any other person to supplement the rate as established. 6. When a center terminates its participation in the program, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, the department may authorize the center to receive continued payment until residents can be relocated. 7 . L i mi tat i on s . a. The department may accumulate and analyze statistics on costs incurred by accredited and nonaccredited residential treatment centers. These statistics may be used to establish reasonable ceiling limitations and incentives for efficiency and economy based on reasonable determination of standards of operations \u00b7necessary for efficient delivery of needed services. These limitations and incentives may be established on the basis of cost of comparable centers and services and may be applied as ceilings on the overall costs of providing services or on specific areas of operations. Limitations and incentives are effective upon notification of a center by the department. b. Allowable administration costs to be included in the established rate are the lesser of the actual cost of administration as direct casted or allocated to the center or an amount equal to fifteen percent of the total allowable costs, exclusive of administration costs, for the center. 8. Adjustment factors may be applied to adjust historical allowable costs. The department will determine the appropriate adjustment factor to be applied. The following cost components may have individual adjustment factors calculated at the point in time when the cost report is due for each rate year: 533 a. Salaries and fringe benefits; b. Food; c. Utilities; and d. Other costs exclusive of property costs. History: Effective May 1, 1994. General Authority: NDCC 50-24.1-04 Law Implemented: 42 USC 1396a(a){30)(A) 75-92-99-95. Resident census. 1. A daily census record must be maintained by the center. Any day services are provided or for which payment is ordinarily sought for an available bed must be counted as a resident day. The day of admission or death will be counted. The day of discharge will be counted if payment is sought for that day. For medical assistance residents, payment may not be sought for any day on which the resident was not in the facility or for the day of discharge. 2. The daily census records must include: a.

Cost allocation. 1. Direct costing of allowable center costs must be used whenever possible. If direct costing is not possible, the allocation methods for center and noncenter operations described in this subsection must be used. a. Salaries for direct care employees, which cannot be reported based on direct costing, must be allocated using time studies. Time studies must be conducted at least semiannually for a two-week period or quarterly for a one-week period. The time study must represent a typical period of time when employees are performing normal work activities in each of their assigned areas of responsibility. Allocation percentages based on the time studies must be used starting with the next pay period following completion of the time study or averaged for the report year. b.\u00b7 Salaries of supervisory personnel must be allocated based on full-time equivalents of the employees supervised or on a ratio of salaries. c. Fringe benefits must be allocated based on the ratio of salaries to total salaries. d. Plant and housekeeping expenses must be allocated based on square footage. e. Property costs must be allocated based on square footage. 537 f. Administration costs must be allocated on the basis of the percentage of total costs, excluding the allocable administration costs. g. Dietary costs must be allocated based on meals served. h. Laundry costs must be a 11 ocated on the basis of pounds of laundry. i. Vehicle expenses must be allocated based on mileage logs. Mileage logs must include documentation for all miles driven and purpose of travel. If sufficient documentation is not available to determine which cost category vehicle expenses are to be allocated, vehicle expenses must be allocated in total to administration. j. Costs not direct casted or allocable using methods identified in subdivisions a through i must be included as administration costs. 2. If the center cannot use any of the allocation methods described in subsection 1, a waiver request may be submitted to the departments medical services division. The request must include an adequate explanation as to why the referenced allocation method cannot be used by the center. The center shall also provide a rationale for the proposed allocation method. Based on the information provided, the department will determine the allocation method used to report costs. History: Effective May 1, 1994. General costs include: 1.

General Authority: NDCC 42 USC 1396a(a)(30}(A) 75-82-89-89. Depreciation. 1. Ratesetting principles require that payment for services should include depreciation on all depreciable type assets used to provide necessary services. This includes assets that may have been fully or partially depreciated on the books of the center, but are in use at the time the center enters the program. The useful lives of such assets are considered not to have ended and depreciation calculated on the revised extended useful life is allowable. Likewise, a depreciation allowance is permitted on assets used in a normal standby or emergency capacity. If any depreciated personal property asset is sold or disposed of for an amount different than its undepreciated value, the difference represents an incorrect allocation of the cost of the asset to the center and must be included as a gain or loss on the cost report. 2. Depreciation methods. a. The straight-line method of depreciation must be used. All accelerated methods of depreciation including depreciation options made available for income tax purposes, such as those offered under the asset depreciation range system, are unacceptable. The method and procedure for computing depreciation must be applied on a basis consistent from year to year, and detailed schedules of individual assets must be maintained. If the books of account reflect depreciation different than that submitted on the cost report, a reconciliation must be prepared by the center. b. Centers must use a minimum composite useful life of ten years for all equipment and land improvements, and four 542 years for vehicles. Buildings and improvements to buildings are to be depreciated over the length of the mortgage or a minimum of twenty-five years, whichever is greater. 3. Acquisitions. a. If a depreciable asset has at the time of its acquisition historical cost of at least one thousand dollars for each item, its cost must be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset except as provided for in subsection 3 of section 75-02-09-11. Costs, such as architectural, consulting and legal fees, and interest, incurred during the construction of an asset must be capitalized as a part of the cost of the asset. b. All repair or maintenance costs in excess of five thousand dollars per project on equipment or buildings must be capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the equipment or building or one-half of the original estimated useful life, whichever is greater. 4. Proper records must provide accountability for the fixed assets and also provide adequate means by which depreciation can be computed and established as an allowable resident-related cost. Tagging of major equipment items is not mandatory, but alternate records must exist to satisfy audit verification of the existence and location of the assets. 5. Basis for depreciation. a. Determination of the cost basis of a center and its depreciable assets, which have not been involved in any programs funded in whole or in part by the department, depends on whether or not the transaction is a bona fide sale. Should the issue arise, the purchaser has the burden of proving that the transaction was a bona fide sale. Purchases where the buyer and seller are related organizations are not bona fide. (1) If the sale is bona fide, the cost basis will be the lower of the actual cost of the buyer or the fair market value of the facility or asset at the time of the sale. (2) If the sale is not bona fide, the cost basis will be the sellers cost basis less accumulated depreciation. b. Cost basis of a center and its depreciable assets purchased as an ongoing operation will be the sellers cost basis less accumulated depreciation. 543 c. Cost basis of a center and its depreciable assets used in any programs funded in whole or in part by the department will be the cost basis used by the other program less accumulated depreciation. d. Sale and leaseback transactions will be considered a related party transaction. The cost basis of a center and its depreciable assets purchased and subsequently leased to a provider who will operate the center will be the sellers cost basis less accumulated depreciation.

Supported by evidence of an agreement that funds were borrowed and that payment of interest and repayment of the funds are required. Repayment of operating loans must be made within two years of the borrowing. 2. Identifiable in the centers accounting records. 3. Related to the reporting period in which the costs are incurred. 4. Necessary and proper for the operation, maintenance, or acquisition of the center. Necessary means that the interest be incurred on a loan made to satisfy a financial need of the center and for a purpose reasonably related to resident care. Proper means that the interest be incurred at a rate not in excess of what a prudent borrower would have had to pay in an arms-length transaction. In addition, the interest must be paid to a lender not related to the center through common ownership or control. 5. Unrelated to funds borrowed to finance costs of assets in excess of the depreciable cost of the asset as recognized in \"depreciation\". 6. If it is necessary to issue bonds for financing, any bond premium or discount will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the bond issue. History: Effective May 1, 1994.

Taxes assessed against the center in accordance with the levying enactments of the several states and lower levels of government and for which the center is liable for payment are allowable costs except for those taxes identified as nonallowable in section 75-02-09-08. 2. Whenever exemptions to taxes are legally available, the center is to take advantage of them. If the center does not take advantage of available exemptions, the expense incurred for such taxes is not an allowable cost. 3. Special assessments in excess of one thousand dollars paid in a lump sum must be capitalized and depreciated. Special assessments not paid in a lump sum may be expensed as they are billed by the taxing authority. H;story: Effective May 1, 1994. General Author;ty: 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A) 75-82-89-12. Home off;ce costs. 1. Home offices of chain organizations vary greatly in size, number of locations, staff, mode of operations, and services furnished to their member facilities. Although the home office of a chain is normally not a center in itself, it may furnish to the individual center central administration or other services such as centralized accounting, purchasing, personnel, or management services. Only the home office's actual costs of providing services is includable in the center's allowable costs under the program. 2. Costs not allowed in the center are not allowed as home office costs allocated to the center. 3. Any service provided by the home office included in costs as payments by the center to an outside vendor or which duplicates costs for services provided by the center is a duplication of costs and is not allowed. 4. Where the home office makes a loan to or borrows money from one of the components of a chain organization, the interest paid is not an allowable cost and interest income is not used to offset interest expense. H;story: Effective May 1, 1994. General Author;ty: NDCC 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A) 545 75-82-89-13. Related organ;zat;ons. 1. Costs applicable to services, facilities, and supplies furnished to a center by a related organization may not exceed the lower of the costs to the related organization or the price of comparable services, facilities, or supplies purchased elsewhere primarily in the local market. Centers must identify such related organizations and costs. If any such costs are allocated, the allocation methods and statistics supporting the allocations must be submitted with the cost report. 2. A center may lease buildings or equipment from a related organization within the meaning of ratesetting principles. In such a case, the rent paid to the lessor by the center is not allowable as cost unless the rent paid is less than the allowable costs of ownership. If rent paid exceeds the allowable costs of ownership, the center may include only the allowable costs of ownership. These costs are property insurance, depreciation, interest on the mortgage, real estate taxes, and plant operation expenses incurred by the lessor. H;story: Effective May 1, 1994. Implemented: 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A) 75-82-89-14. Startup costs. In the first stages of operation, a new center incurs certain costs in developing its ability to care for residents prior to their admission. Staff is obtained and organized, and other operating costs are incurred during this time of preparation which cannot be allocated to resident care during that period because there are not residents receiving services. Such costs are commonly referred to as startup costs. The startup costs are to be capitalized and will be recognized as allowable administration costs amortized over sixty consecutive months on a straight-line basis starting with the month the first resident is admitted. H;story: Effective May 1, 1994. General 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A) 75-92-89-15. Compensat;on. Reasonable compensation for a person with a minimum of five percent ownership, persons on the governing board, or family members of top management personnel, including spouses and persons in the following relationship to top management personnel or their spouses: parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, stepgrandparent, grandchild, stepgrandchild, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, stepbrother, and stepsister will be considered an allowable cost if services are actually performed and required to be performed. The amount allowed must be in an amount not 546 to exceed the average of salaries paid to individuals in like positions in all accredited and nonaccredited licensed residential treatment centers that are nonprofit organizations and have no top management personnel who have a minimum of five percent ownership or are on the governing board. Salaries used to determine the average will be based on the latest information available to the department. Reasonableness also requires that functions performed be necessary in that, had the services not been rendered, the center would have to employ another person to perform them.

Centers must identify income to offset costs when applicable in order that state financial participation not supplant or duplicate other funding sources. Any income whether in cash or in any other form received by the center, with the exception of the established rate and income from payment made under the Job Training Partnership Act, will be offset up to the total of the appropriate actual costs. If actual costs are not identifiable, income will be offset in total to the appropriate cost category. If costs relating to income are reported in more than one cost category, the income must be offset based on the ratio of costs in each of the cost categories. 1. Income received from or on behalf of employees, guests, or other nonresidents for meals or snacks and received for food and related costs from other government programs such as the United States department of agriculture or the department of public instruction must be offset to dietary costs. 2. Income received from the sale of beverages, candy, or other food items must be offset to dietary costs. 3. Any amount received from insurance for a loss incurred must be offset against the appropriate cost category regardless of when the cost was incurred if the center did not adjust the basis for depreciable assets. 4. Any refund, rebate, or discount received for a reported cost must be offset against the appropriate cost. 5. Any amount received for use of the center's vehicles must be offset to transportation costs. 6. Gain on the sale of an asset must be offset against depreciation expense. 7. Revenue received from outside sources for the use of center buildings or equipment will be offset to property expenses. 547 8. Any amount received by the center from outside sources for services provided by center employees will be offset to salaries. 9. Revenue from investments will be offset against interest expense. 10. Grants, gifts, restricted donations, and awards from the federal, state, local, or philanthropic agencies will be offset to allowable costs. 11. Gifts or endowment income designated by a donor for paying specific operating costs incurred in providing contract services must be offset to costs in the year the cost is incurred regardless of when the gift or endowment is received. 12. Other cost-related income or miscellaneous income, including amounts generated through the sale of a previously expensed item, e.g., supplies or equipment, must be offset to the cost category where the item was expensed. 13. Other income to the center from local, state, or federal units of government may be determined by the department to be an offset to costs. History: Effective May 1, 1994. General Authority: NDCC 50-24.1-04 Law Implemented: 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A) 75-82-89-17. Private pay rates. 1. The medical assistance rate will not exceed the full rate charged to nonmedical assistance residents for the same service. The rate being charged nonmedical assistance residents at the time the services were provided will govern. In cases where the residents are not charged a daily rate, a daily rate will be computed by dividing the total nonmedical assistance charges for each month by the total nonmedical assistance census for each month. 2. If the established rate exceeds the rate charged to nonmedical ass.istance residents for a service, on any given date, the center shall immediately report that fact to the department and charge the department at the lower rate. If payments were received at the higher rate, the center shall, within thirty days, refund the overpayment. The refund will be the difference between the established rate and the rate charged to nonmedical assistance residents times the number of medical assistance resident days paid during the period in which the established rate exceeded the nonmedical assistance rate plus interest calculated at two percent over the Bank of North 548 Dakota prime rate on any amount not repaid within thirty days. Interest charges on these refunds are not allowable costs. History: Effective May 1, 1994. General appeals. 1. Reconsiderations. a. A center dissatisfied with the final rate established must request a reconsideration of the final rate before a formal appeal may be made. Any requests for reconsideration must be filed with the department's medical services division within thirty days of the date of the rate notification. b. The department's medical services division will make a determination regarding the reconsideration within forty-five days of receiving the reconsideration filing and any requested documentation. 2. Appeals. a. A center dissatisfied with the final rate established may appeal upon completion of the reconsideration process as provided for in subsection 1. This appeal must be filed with the department within thirty days of the date of the written notice of the determination by the department's medical services division with respect to the request for reconsideration. b. An appeal under this section is timely perfected only if accompanied by written documents including: (1) A copy of the letter received from the department's medical services division advising of that division's decision on the request for reconsideration; (2) A statement of each disputed item and the reason or basis for the dispute; (3) A computation and the dollar amount which reflects the appealing party's claim as to the correct computation and dollar amount for each disputed item; (4) The authority in statute or rule upon which the appealing party relies for each disputed item; and 549 (5) The name, address, and telephone number of the person upon whom all notices will be served regarding the appeal.

General Author;ty: NDCC 50-24.1-04 Law Implemented: 42 USC l396a(a)(30)(A) 550 JULY 1994 CHAPTER 75-92-96 AGENCY SYNOPSIS: Regarding proposed amendments to North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-02-06, Ratesetting for Nursing Home Care. A public hearing was conducted on January 7, 1994, concerning proposed amendments to North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-02-06, Ratesetting for Nursing Home Care, which governs the setting of rates for nursing facilties in North Dakota. The three primary purposes of the amendemtns are to implement changes to section 75-02-06-16, Rate Determinations; to implement provisions of North Dakota Century Code section 50-24.4-19.2, concerning residents with extraordinary needs, as required by 1993 Senate Bill 2331; and to conform the rules to the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(e)(7)(F), as required by final federal regulations published in 57 Fed. Reg. 56450 (Nov. 30, 1992). The amendments also incorporate a number of changes made possible by amendments to North Dakota Century Code section 28-32-02{7). Prior to August 1, 1993, this statute provided that \"the attorney general may not approve any rule as to legality when the rule merely repeats or paraphrases the text of the statute purported to be implemented by the rule.\" Under that law, the department could not incorporate provisions of North Dakota Century Code chapter 50-24.4 into North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-02-06, even though both addressed the same subject. Changes were made to incorporate relevant statutory provisions into the Administrative Code so as to create a single document which is more easily used. The amendments to North Dakota Administrative Code section 75-02-06-16 reflect the fact that nursing home rates are being \"rebased\" effective January 1, 1994. Also changed is the process by which base year costs are applied to establish limitations on rates set for nursing 551 facilities. In addition to altering the limits, amendments to this section specify the economic change index to be the consumer price index increase. This section is also altered to provide a means by which facilities which successfully appeal a rate are able to avoid the loss of proper rate payments due from private-paying residents during the period pending the appeal decision. This change implements North Dakota Century Code section 50-24.4-18.1, as created by 1993 Senate Bill No. 2404. The former section 75-02-06-19, Refinancing Incentives, has been replaced with a new section: \"Appeal from Facility Transfer or Discharge.\" The removed language was obsolete. The replacement language conforms to the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(3)(7)(F). It implements amendments to 42 CFR Parts 431, 433, and 483 concerning appeals from nursing facility decisions to transfer or discharge residents. This activity has been undertaken by the North Dakota State Department of Health and Consolidated Laboratories under North Dakota Administrative Code section 33-07-33.1-39. Federal regulations now require that the appeals process be maintained as a part of the Medicaid agency's fair hearing process. A new North Dakota Administrative Code section 75-02-06-21, Specialized Rates for Extraordinary Medical Care, is created. This rule implements North Dakota Century Code section 50-24.4-19.2, which became effective March 26, 1993. The rule establishes the criteria for determining if a specialized rate for an individual with extraordinary medical needs may be established. The new section also describes a manner in which the specialized rate is to be calculated. There are numerous minor and technical changes contained in amendments affecting all remaining sections except 75-02-06-02.3, Other Direct Care Costs; 75-02-06-04.1, Funded Investment; 75-02-06-07, Related Organization; and 75-02-06-20, Resident Personal Funds. For the sake of clarity, those sections without amendments were included in the published proposal. These amendments constitute a significant change in the department's methods and standards for setting payment rates for services furnished to nursing facilities. The amendments to chapter 75-02-06 were adopted as interim final rules effective November 22, 1993. Emergency rulemaking was necessary because a delay in rulemaking was likely to cause a loss of $5,493,800 in federal revenues appropriated to support the administration of the Medicaid program, a duty imposed upon the Department of Human Services by North Dakota Century Code section 50-06-05.1 and North Dakota Century Code chapter 50-24.1, if the effective date of this amendment is July 1, 1994, as would be likely if diligent nonemergency rulemaking was pursued. During the period before the effective date, the unamended rule would cause rates to be established at higher levels for the 1994 rate year. The excess cost of the higher level rates would cause the department to 552 spend all funds appropriated for payment of nursing care services provided to Medicaid eligible nursing facility residents for the 1993-95 biennium, by June 17, 1995. Nursing facility services are a mandated Medicaid service under 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A). If the department did not conform the Medicaid program to this federal requirement, it may not lawfully claim federal funds otherwise available to provide Medicaid benefits for the period beginning June 17, 1995, and ending June 30, 1995. 75-82-86-81.

The facility shall maintain on the premises the required census records and financial information wR~eR--w~tt--8e s~ff~e~eAt in a manner sufficient to provide for a proper audit or review. For any cost being claimed on the cost report, sufficient data must be available as of the audit date to fully support the report item. b. Where several facilities are associated with a group and their accounting and reports are centrally prepared, added information must be submitted, for those items known to be lacking support at the reporting facility, with the cost report or must be provided to the local facility prior to the audit or review of the facility. Accounting or financial information regarding related organizations must be readily available to substantiate cost. Home office cost reporting and cost allocation must be in conformance with this chapter and HCFA-15 paragraphs 2150 and 2153. c. Each provider shall maintain, for a period of not less than five years following the date of submission of the cost report to the state--a\u00a7eAey department, accurate financial and statistical records of the period covered by such cost report wR~eR--aFe--aee~Fate-aAa in sufficient detail to substantiate the cost data reported. Each provider shall make such records available upon reasonable demand to representatives of the department or to the secretary of health and human services or representatives of the secretary. 2. Accounting and reporting requirements. a. The accrual basis of accounting, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, must be used for cost reporting purposes. A facility may maintain its accounting records on a cash basis during the year, but adjustments must be made to reflect proper accrual accounting procedures at yearend and when subsequently reported. 6eAeFatty--aeee~tea-aeee~AttA\u00a7-~F~Aet~tes-wt++ . ~Feva~+--~A+ess--a+teFAat~ve--tFeat~eAt--~s--~Fev~aea---tA Fatesett~A\u00a7---~Feeea~Fes~ Ratesetting procedures will prevail if conflicts occur between ratesetting procedures and generally accepted accounting principles. b. To properly facilitate auditing, the accounting system shall be maintained in s~eR a manner that will allow cost accounts wt++ to be grouped by cost center and ee readily traceable to the-cost report. 558 c. The method for annual reporting of costs for ratesetting purposes shall be prescribed by the department. A cost report; for the report year, satisfying all departmental reporting requirements~ must be filed with the management services division, provider audit unit on forms prescribed by the department, on or before October first of each year. The report mus~ include: (1) A complete statement of fees and charges for private-pay residents for the report year. (2) A statement of ownership for the facility, including the name, address, and proportion of ownership of each owner. (a) If a privately held or closely held corporation or partnership has an ownership interest in the facility, the facility shall report the name, address, and proportion of ownership of all owners of the corporation or partnership who have an ownership interest of five percent or more, except that any owner whose compensation or portion of compensation is claimed in the facility's cost report must be identified regardless of the proportion of ownership interest. (b) If a publicly held corporation has an ownership interest of fifteen percent or more in the facility, the facility shall report the name, address, and proportion of ownership of all owners of the publicly held corporation who have an ownership interest of ten percent or more. (3) Supplemental information reconciling the costs on the financial statements with costs on the cost report. (4) A provider organization which operates more than one nursing facility may provide a consolidated audit report. The information must be reconciled to each facility's cost report. (5) Information requested by the department, pursuant to subdivision d of subsection 1 of North Dakota Century Code section 50-24.4-23, must be furnished by financial statements, together with supplemental information which reconciles costs on the financial statement with costs on the cost report. (6) The audited report provided pursuant to subdivision a of subsection 1 of North Dakota Century Code section 50-24.4-23 must be for the facility's fiscal year. 559 d. In the event a facility fails to file the required cost report on or before the due date, the ~ea~eat--sepv~ees S~Y~S~8R department may eep~~fy-a-Fa~e-e~~at reduce the current payment rate to eighty percent of the es~a8t~sRea rate in effect feF-seFv~ees-~Fev~aea-af~eF-~Re-a~e-aa~e on October first. Reinstatement of the rate sRatt will occur ~~eA on the first of the month beginning after receipt of the required ees~--Fe~eF~ information, but is not retroactive. e. The facility shall make all adjustments, allocations, and projections necessary to arrive at allowable costs. The department may reject any cost report when the informatTOn filed is incomplete or inaccurate. If a cost report is rejected, the department may reduce the current payment rate to eighty percent of its most recently established rate until the information is completely and accurately filed. f. Costs reported must include total costs and be adjusted to allowable costs. Adjustments required by the provider audit unit, to attain allowable cost, though not meeting the medicaid state agency or the state medicaid investigative group criteria of fraud or abuse on their initial identification, could, if repeated on future cost filings, be considered as possible fraud or abuse. The provider audit unit will forward all such items identified to the appropriate medicaid investigative group. 3. A~a~~~A\u00a7~ The department will perform an audit of a~-teas~ the latest available report year of each facility at least once every six years and retain for at least three years all audit-related documents, including cost reports, working papers, and internal reports on rate calculations WR~eR-aFe ~~~t~lea used and generated by audit staff in performance of audits and in es~aat~SR~A\u00a7 the establishment of rates. Audits will meet generally accepted governmental a~a~~ auditing standards. 4.

H;story: Effective January 1, 1990; amended effective November 22, allocat;ons. 1. Direct costing of allowable costs will be used whenever possible. For facilities which cannot direct cost, the following allocation methods are to be used: a. For nursing facilities that are combined with a hospital or have more than one license (including basic care}, the following allocation methods must be used: (1) (2) (3) ill Nursing salaries which cannot be reported based on actual costs are to be allocated using time studies. Time studies must be conducted at least semiannually for a two-week period or quarterly for a one-week period. The time study must represent a typical period of time when employees are performing normal work activities in each of their assigned areas of responsibilities. Allocation percentages based on the time studies are to be used starting with the next pay period following completion of the time study or averaged for the report year. The methodology used by the facility may not be changed without approval by the department. If time studies are not completed, nursing salaries will be allocated based on revenues for resident services. Salaries for a director of nursing or nursing supervisors which cannot be reported based on actual costs or time studies must be allocated based on nursing salaries or full-time equivalents (FTEs) of nursing staff. Salaries for cost center supervisors must be allocated based on cost center salaries or full-time equivalents (FTEs) of supervised staff. Staff development or inservice trainer salaries must be allocated to nursing and therapies based on the ratio of nursing and therapy salaries to total salaries, to non-long-term care based on the ratio of non-long-term care salaries to total salaries, and to admini\u00b7stration based on the ratio of total salaries less nursing salaries, therapy salaries, and non-long-term care salaries to total salaries. Other nursing costs must be allocated based on resident days. Therapy costs, other than therapy salaries and purchased services, must be allocated based on the ratio of therapy salaries and purchased services in the nursing facility to total therapy salaries and purchased services. 566 {6~ 1Zl Dietary and food costs must be allocated based on number of meals served or in-house resident days. {7~ ~ Laundry costs must be allocated on the basis of pounds of laundry. {8~ 121 Activity costs must be allocated based on in-house resident days. {9~ ~ Social service costs must be allocated based on resident days. {19~ 1111 Housekeeping costs must be allocated based on weighted square footage. {1\u00b1~ i1fl Plant operation costs must be allocated based on weighted square footage. {12~ l11l Medical records costs must be allocated based on the number of admissions or discharges and deaths. {\u00b13~ ~ Pharmacy costs for consultants must be allocated based on in-house resident days. {\u00b14~ 11\u00a71 Administration costs must be allocated on the basis of the percentage of total adjusted cost, excluding property, administration, and chaplain, in each facility. {\u00b1S~ 11\u00a71 Property costs must be allocated first to a cost center based on square footage. The property costs allocated to a given cost center will then be allocated using the methodologies set forth in this section for that particular cost center. {\u00b16~ 1lZl Chaplain costs must be allocated based on the percentage of total adjusted costs, excluding property, administration, and chaplain. {17~ 11\u00a71 Employment benefits must be allocated based on the ratio of salaries to total salaries. b. If any of the allocation methods in subdivision a cannot be used by a facility, a waiver request may be submitted to the medical services division. The request must include an adequate explanation as to why the referenced allocation method cannot be used by the facility. The facility must also provide a rationale for the proposed allocation method. Based on the information provided, the department will determine the allocation method that will be used to report costs. 567 c. Malpractice, professional liability insurance, therapy salaries, and purchased therapy services must be direct cos ted. d. The costs of operating a pharmacy must be included as non-long-term care costs. e. For purposes of this subsection, '\"weighted square footage\" means the allocation of the facility's total square footage, excluding common areas, identified first to a cost category and then allocated based on the allocation method described in this subsection for that cost category. 2. For nursing facilities that cannot directly identify salaries and employment benefits to a cost category, the following cost allocation methods must be used: a. Salaries, excluding staff development and inservice trainer salaries, must be allocated using time studies. Time studies must be conducted semiannually for a two-week period or quarterly for a one-week period. The time study must represent a typical period of time when employees are performing normal work activities in each of their assigned areas of responsibilities. Allocation percentages based on the time studies are to be used starting with the next pay period following completion of time study or averaged for the reporting year. The methodology used by the facility may not be changed without approval by the department. If time studies are not completed, salaries and employment benefits will be allocated entirely to the indirect care costs, if any of the employee's job duties are included in this cost category. Otherwise, salaries and employment benefits will be other direct care costs. b. Staff development and inservice trainer salaries must be allocated to nursing and therapies based on the ratio of nursing and therapy salaries to total salaries and to administration based on the ratio of total salaries less nursing and therapy salaries to total salaries. c. Employment benefits must be allocated based on the ratio of salaries in the cost category to total salaries. 3. Nursing facilities which operate or are associated with nonresident-related activities, i.e., apartment complexes, shall allocate all costs, except administration costs, in the manner required by subsection 1, and shall allocate administration costs as follows: a. If tRe total costs of tRe all nonresident-related activities exceed five percent of total nursing facility 568 cost, exclusive of property, administration, and chaplain costs, administration costs must be allocated on the basis of the percentage of total cost, excluding property, administration, and chaplain. b. If tAe total costs of tAe all nonresident-related --activities are less than five percent of total nursing facility costs, exclusive of property, administration, and chaplain costs, administration costs must be allocated to each such activity based on the percent gross revenues for the activity is of total gross revenues; provided, however, that the allocation will not be based on a percentage exceeding two percent for each activity. c. If the provider can document, to the satisfaction of the department, that none of the nursing facility resources or services are used in connection with the nonresident-related activities, no allocation need be made. d. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to the activities of hospital and basic care facilities associated with a nursing facility. History: Effective January 1, 1990; amended effective January 1, 1992; November 1, 1992; November 1. Ratesetting principles require that payment for services should include depreciation on all depreciable ty~e assets tAat--aFe used to provide necessary services. This includes assets that may have been fully {or partially} depreciated on the books of the provider, but are in use at the time the provider enters the program. The useful lives of such assets are considered not to have ended and depreciation calculated on the revised extended useful life is allowable. Likewise, a depreciation allowance is permitted on assets tAat-aFe used in a normal standby or emergency capacity. If any depreciated personal property asset is sold or disposed of for an amount different than its undepreciated value, the difference represents an incorrect allocation of the cost of the asset to the facility and must be included as a gain or loss on the cost report. 2. Depreciation methods. a. The straight-line method of depreciation must be used. All accelerated methods of depreciation, including depreciation options made available for income tax 569 purposes, are unacceptable. The method and procedure for computing depreciation must be applied on a basis consistent from year to year and detailed schedules of individual assets shall be maintained. If the books of account reflect depreciation different than that submitted on the cost report, a reconciliation must be prepared by the facility. b. Providers shall project a useful life at least as long as the useful life guidelines published by the American hospital association. The provider may choose to use a composite useful life of ten years for all equipment and four years for vehicles. With the exception of assets purchased prior to July 1, 1989, all assets must be depreciated using the same methodology. Once the composite useful life methodology is chosen, the provider may not change to using the American hospital association guidelines without the approval of the department. 3. Acquisitions. a. If a depreciable asset or special assessment has, at the time of its acquisition, a historical cost of at least one thousand dollars, its cost must be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Cost during the construction of an asset, such as architectural, consulting and legal fees, interest, etc., should be capitalized as a part of the cost of the asset. b. All repair or maintenance costs in excess of five thousand dollars per project on equipment or buildings must be capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the equipment or building repaired or maintained, or one-half of the original estimated useful life, whichever is greater. 4. Proper records will provide accountability for the fixed assets and also provide adequate means by which depreciation can be computed and established as an allowable resident-related cost. Tagging of major equipment items is not mandatory, but alternate records must exist to satisfy audit verification of the existence and location of the assets. 5. For purposes of this chapter, donated assets may be recorded and depreciated based on their fair market value. In the case where the provider's records do not contain the fair market value of the donated asset, as of the date of the donation, an appraisal must be made. The appraisal will be made by a recognized appraisal expert and will be accepted for depreciation purposes. The facility may elect to forego depreciation on donated assets thereby negating the need for a fair market value determination. 570 6. Purchase of a facility and its depreciable assets as an ongoing operation. a. Determination of the cost basis of a facility and its depreciable assets of an ongoing operation depends on whether or not the transaction is a bona fide sale. Should the issue arise, the purchaser has the burden of proving that the transaction was a bona fide sale. Purchases where the buyer and seller are related organizations are not bona fide. The cost basis of a facility and its depreciable assets acquired as an ongoing operation is limited to the lowest of the following: (1) Current reproduction cost of the assets, depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful life to the time of the sale; (2) Price paid by the purchaser (actual cost); (3) Fair market value of the facility or asset at the time of the sale; (4) In a sale not bona fide, the seller's cost basis, less accumulated depreciation; or (5) With respect to sales made on or after July 18, 1984, the seller's cost basis less accumulated depreciation, plus recaptured depreciation. (6) In the case of assets wA~\u20acA-Aave-8eeA previously owned by a hospital, or facility, and for which such hospital or facility has received payment, for services provided to recipients of benefits under title XVIII (medicare) or XIX (medicaid) of the Social Security Act, at a rate which reflects depreciation expense concerning those assets, the allowable acquisition cost of such assets to the first owner on or after July 18, 1984. b. The seller shall always use the sale price in computing the gain or loss on the disposition of assets. c. Appraisal guidelines. To properly provide for costs or valuations of fixed assets, an appraisal will be required if the provider: (1) Has no historical cost records or has incomplete records of depreciable fixed assets; or (2) Prior to July 18, 1984, purchases a facility without designation of purchase price for the classification of assets acquired. Prior to having an appraisal made, the provider must inform the state that it 571 intends to have the appraisal made. At this time the provider shall also set forth the reasons for the appraisal and will make available to the department the agreement between the provider and the appraiser. The appraisal agreement should contain the appraisal date, the estimated date of completion, the scope of the appraisal, and the statement that the appraisal will conform to the current medicare regulation on principles of reimbursement for provider cost. (3) Limitation. With respect to purchases occurring before July 18, 1984, the department will recognize appraised value not to exceed cost basis for tax purposes. In all cases of major change, proper authority for expenditure shall be obtained. 7. For rate years beginning on or after January 1, 1990, the department will recognize for depreciation purposes the difference of the actual purchase price of building and equipment for nonrelated party purchases finalized before July 1, 1987, and the cost basis established at the time of purchase. The department will continue to use the useful life and the cost basis established at the time the purchases were made in determining the basis of depreciation for a facility purchased as an ongoing operation on or after July 1, 1987. No adjustments will be allowed for any depreciable costs that exceeded the basis in effect for rate periods prior to January 1, 1990. 8. Recapture of depreciation. . a. At any time that the operators of a facility sell an asset, or otherwise remove that asset from service in or to the facility, any depreciation costs asserted after June 1, 1984, with respect to that asset, are subject to recapture to the extent that the sale or disposal price exceeds the undepreciated value. If the department determines that a sale or disposal was made to a related party, or if a facility terminates participation as a provider of services in the medicaid program, any depreciation costs asserted after June 1, 1984, with respect to that asset or facility, are subject to recapture to the extent that the fair market value of the asset or facility exceeds the depreciated value. b. The seller and the purchaser may, by agreement, determine which shall pay the recaptured depreciation. If the depreciation recapture amount is not paid in full to the department within thirty days after the date of the sale, the department will offset the amount of depreciation to be recaptured against any amounts owed, or to be owed, by the department to the seller and buyer. The department will first exercise the offset against the seller, and 572 shall only exercise the offset against the buyer to the extent that the seller has failed to repay the amount of the recaptured depreciation, plus interest. If the depreciation recapture amount is not paid in full to the department within thirty days of the date of the sale, interest on the depreciation recapture amount from the date of sale is due to the department in addition to the depreciation recapture amount. The interest accrues at the rate at which interest accrues against the state of North Dakota, under the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990, [Pub. L. 101-453; 31 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.] for refunds of federal medicaid funds received by the state, but not repaid to the federal agency, or six percent per annum, whichever is greater. Depreciation recapture amounts and interest payments made thereon to the department and the cost of borrowing for the purpose of repaying recaptured depreciation and interest on recaptured depreciation are not costs which are related to resident care. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983; October 1, 1984; September 1, 1987; January 1, 1990; January 1, 1992; 1. To be allowable ~AaeF-tRe-~Fe\u00a7Faffi, interest must be: a. Supported by evidence of an agreement that funds were borrowed and that payment of interest and repayment of the funds are required; b. Identifiable in the providers accounting records; c. Related to the reporting period in which the costs are incurred; d. Necessary and proper for the operation, maintenance, or acquisition of the ~Fev~aeF!s-fae~t~t~es facility; e. Unrelated to funds borrowed to purchase assets in excess of the depreciable cost basis established at the time of purchase and recognized under the provisions of section 75-02-06-03; and f. When representative of borrowing for the purpose of making capital expenditures for assets that were owned by any other hospital or facility on or after July 18, 1984, limited to that amount of interest cost which such hospital or facility may have reported, for medicaid 573 ratesetting purposes, had the asset undergone neither refinancing nor a change of ownership. 2. In s~eR cases where it was necessary to issue bonds for financing, any bond premium or discount shall be amortized over the life of the bond issue. 3. Interest paid by the provider to partners, stockholders, or related organizations of the provider is not allowable as a cost. Where the owner loans funds to a facility, the funds are considered capital, rather than borrowed funds. 4. If a facility incurs interest expense because of late payments for resident services and charges a service charge or interest for late payments, such income must be offset against interest expense. If no interest expense is incurred by the facility because of late payments for resident services, interest charges paid must be offset against administrative expense. 5. Repayment of operating loans must be made within three years of the borrowing. 6. For the purposes of this section;-llAeeessapyll: a. 11Necessary11 means that the interest is incurred on a loan made to satisfy a financial need of the facility and; for a purpose reasonably related to resident care;i and b. ll~pe~epll 11Proper11 means that the interest is incurred at a rate not in excess of what a prudent borrower would be obliged to pay in an arms-length transaction. 7. Interest must be paid to a lender that is not related to the borrower except for funds borrowed in accordance with section 75-02-06-04.1. 8. For refinanced or refunded debt, the total net aggregate allowable costs to be incurred for all reporting periods may not exceed the total net aggregate costs that would have been allowed had the refinancing or refunding not occurred. Annual allowable costs will be limited to the lesser of the costs which would have been allowed had the refinancing or refunding not occurred or the costs associated with the refinancing or refunding plus the portion, if any, of adjustments not recognized in prior cost reporting periods. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983; October 1, 1984; September 1, 1987; January 1, 1990; top management personnel;-wA~eA-~s-atteeatee eF-S~Feetty-ass~\u00a7Aee-te-a-faetttty; will be limited, prior to allocation, if any, to the highest market-driven compensation of an administrator employed by a freestanding facility during the ease report year as-~ASeMee-feFwaFe. 2. fte~s--wA~eA--aFe-eeAsteeFee-ee~~eAsat~eA-tAet~Se;-e~t-aFe-Ret tt~ttee-te;-tAe-fettewtA\u00a7 Compensation includes: a. Salary amounts paid for managerial, administrative, professional, and other services. b. Amounts paid by the facility for the personal benefits of the person, e.g., housing allowance, flat-rate automobile allowance. c. The cost of assets and services which the person receives from the facility. d. Deferred compensation (pension and annuities). e. Supplies and services for the personal use of the person. f. The cost of a domestic or other employee who works in the home of the person. g. Life and health insurance premiums paid for the person and medical services furnished at nursing facility expense. 3. Reasonable compensation for a person with a least five percent ownership, persons on the governing board, or any person related within the third degree of kinship to top management personnel must be considered an allowable cost if services are actually performed and required to be performed. The amount to be allowed must be an amount determined by the department to be equal to the amount normally required to be paid for the same services if provided by a nonrelated employee. Reasonableness also requires that functions performed be necessary in that, had the services not been rendered, the facility would have to employ another person to perform them. Reasonable compensation on an hourly basis may not exceed the amount determined to be the limitation in section 75-02-06-05.1, divided by two thousand eighty. 4. Costs otherwise nonallowable under this chapter may not be included as personal compensation. H;story: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective July 1, 1981; December 1, 1983; September 1, 1987; January 1, 1990; 75-92-96-96.1. Home office costs. 1. Home offices of chain organizations vary greatly in size, number of locations, staff, mode of operations, and services furnished to their member facilities. Although the home office of a chain is normally not a provider in itself, it may furnish central administration or other services such as centralized accounting, purchasing, personnel, or management services. To the extent that the home office furnishes services related to resident care to a facility, the reasonable resident-related costs, not to exceed actual costs of such services, are includable in the facilitys cost report and are includable as part of the facilitys rate. 2. Where the home office makes a loan to or borrows money from one of the components of a chain organization, the interest paid is not an allowable cost and interest income is not used to offset interest expense. 3. Home office costs incurred for expansion of a chain organization must be directly allocated to the appropriate component of the chain. The costs of abandoned plans are not allowable. 4. Central or home office costs representing services of consultants required by law in areas for social services, nursing, therapies, or activities and central, affiliated, or corporate office costs representing services of consultants not required by law in the areas of nursing or therapies may be allocated to the appropriate cost category of a facility according to subdivisions a through e. a. Only the salaries, fringe benefits, and payroll taxes associated with the individual performing the service may be allocated. No other costs may be allocated. b. The allocation must be based on direct identification and only to the extent justified in time distribution records that show the actual time spent by the consultant performing the services in the facility. c. The cost in subdivision a for each consultant must not be \u00b7allocated to more than one cost category in the facility. If more than one facility is served by a consultant, all facilities shall allocate the consultants cost to the same operating category. d. Top management personnel may not be considered consultants. 576 e. The consultants full-time responsibilities must be to provide the services allocated under this section. History: Effective January 1, 1990; amended effective November 22, Rental expense paid to a related organization. A provider may lease a facility from a related organization within the meaning of ratesetting principles. In such case, the rent paid to the lessor by the provider is not allowable as cost unless the rent paid is less than the allowable costs of ownership. The provider, however, may include allowable costs of ownership of the facility. These costs are property insurance, depreciation, interest on the mortgage, and real estate taxes. Other operating expenses of the related organization are not includable by the provider as an allowable cost of ownership. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983; September 1, 1987; January 1, 1990; November Taxes. 1. Taxes assessed against the provider, in accordance with the levying enactments of the several states and lower levels of government and for which the provider is liable for payment, are allowable costs. Tax expense may not include fines, penalties, or those taxes identified as nonallowable costs in section 75-02-06-12.1. 2. Whenever exemptions to taxes are legally available the provider is to take advantage of them. If the provider does not take advantage of available exemptions, the expense incurred for such taxes is not FeeegA~lea-as an allowable cost ~ASeF-tAe-~FB\u00a7Fa~. 3. Special assessments in excess of one thousand dollars;-wA~eA ape paid in a lump sum; must be capitalized and depreciated. Special assessments not paid in a lump sum may be expensed as billed by the taxing authority. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983; January 1, 1990; November Bad debts. 577 1. Bad debts for charges incurred on or after January 1, 1990, and fees paid for the collection of those bad debts, are allowable provided all the requirements of this subsection are met: a. The bad debt results from nonpayment of the payment rate or part of the payment rate. b. The facility documents that reasonable collection efforts have been made, the debt was uncollectible, and there is no likelihood of future recovery. Reasonable collection efforts include pursuing all avenues of collection available to the facility, including liens and judgments. In instances where the bad debt is owed by a person determined to have made a disqualifying transfer or assignment of property for the purpose of securing eligibility for medical assistance benefits, the facility shall document that it has made all reasonable efforts to secure payment from the transferee, including the bringing of an action for a transfer in fraud of creditors. c. The collection fee does not exceed the amount of the bad debt. d. The bad debt does not result from the facility's failure to comply with federal and state laws, state rules, and federal regulations. e. The bad debt does not result from nonpayment of a private room rate in excess of the established rate or charges for special services wR~\u20acR-aFe not included in the established rate. \u00b7 f. The facility has an aggressive policy of avoiding bad debt expense which will limit potential bad debts. The facility shall document that the facility has taken action to limit bad debts for individuals who refuse to make payment. In no instances may allowable bad debt expense exceed one hundred twenty days of resident care for any one individual. 2. Finance charges on bad debts wR~\u20acR-aFe allowed in subsection 1 are allowable if the finance charges have been offset as interest income in prior years. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983; January 1, 1990; November Startup costs. In the first stages of operation, a new facility incurs certain costs in developing its ability to care for 578 residents prior to admission. Staff is obtained, and organized, and other operating costs are incurred during this time of preparation which cannot be allocated to resident care during that period because there are no residents receiving services. Such costs are commonly referred to as startup costs. Actual allowable startup costs may be considered as deferred charges ~AaeF-t~e-~Fegpa~ and allocated over a number of periods which benefit from such costs. Where a facility has properly capitalized startup costs as a deferred charge, the startup costs will be recognized as allowable costs amortized over sixty consecutive months starting with the month in which the first resident is admitted. H;story: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983; January 1, 1990; November to cost. 1. Several items of income,-w~et~eF-~A-eas~-eF-~A-aAy-et~eF-feF~; will be considered as offsets against various costs as recorded in the books of the facility. Any income w~~e~-ts~ whether in cash or in any other form, received by the facility, with the exception of the established rate, income from payments made under the Job Training Partnership Act, and income from charges te-~F~vate-~ay-Fes~aeAts for private rooms or special services, will be offset up to the total of the appropriate actual allowable cost. If actual costs are not identifiable, income will be offset up to the total of costs described in this section. If costs relating to income are reported in more than one cost category, the income must be offset in the ratio of the costs in each cost category. These sources of income include, but are not limited to: a. 11Activities income11 Income from the activities department and the gift shop will be offset to activity costs. b. 11Dietary income11 Amounts received from or on behalf of employees, guests, or other nonresidents for lunches, meals, or snacks will be offset to dietary costs. c. 11Drugs or supplies income... Amounts received from employees, doctors, or others not admitted as residents will be offset to nursing supplies. Medicare part B income for drugs and supplies must be offset to nursing supplies. d. 11Insurance recoveries income ... Any amount received from insurance for a loss incurred shall be offset against the appropriate cost category, regardless of when the cost was incurred, if the facility did not adjust the basis for depreciable assets. 579 e. 11Interest or investment income11 Interest received on investments! except amounts earned on funded depreciation or from earnings on gifts where the identity remains intactt shall be offset to interest expense. f. 11Laundry income... All amounts received for services rendered to or on behalf of employees! doctorst or others will be offset to laundry costs. g. 11Private duty nurse income... Income received for the providing of a private duty nurse will be offset to nursing salaries. h. 11Rentals of facility space income11 Income received from outside sources for the use of facility space and equipment will be offset to property costs. i. 11Telegraph and telephone income ... Income received from residents! guestst or employees will be offset to ~Aa~Feet administration costs. Income from emergency answering services need not be offset. j. 11Therapy income... Income from all therapy services will be offset to therapy costs. This includes income for nonresident-related therapy services not separately casted out and all medicare part A and B therapy income. k. 11Vending income11 Income from the sale of beverages! candyt or other items will be offset to the cost of the vending items art if the cost is not identified! all vending income will be offset to administrative costs. l. 11Bad debt recovery ... Income for bad debts which have been previously claimed shall be offset to administrative costs in the year of recovery. m. 110ther cost-related income... Miscellaneous incomet including amounts generated through the sale of a previously expensed or depreciated itemt e.g.t supplies or equipment! must be offset to the cost category where the item was expensed or depreciated. 2. Payments to a provider by its vendor will ordinarily be treated as purchase discounts! allowances! refundst or rebates in determining allowable costs even though these payments may be treated as 11COntributions11 or .. unrestricted grants11 by the provider and the vendor. Howevert such payments may represent a true donation or grant. Examples includet but are not limited tot when: (1) they are made by a vendor in response to building or other fundraising campaigns in which communitywide contributions are solicited; or (2) the volume or value of purchases is so nominal that no relationship to the contribution can be inferred. The provider must provide sse verification, satisfactory to the department, to support a claim that a payment represents a true donation. 3. Where an owner or other official of a provider directly receives from a vendor monetary payments or goods or services for the owners or official s own personal use as a result of the providers purchases from the vendor, the value of such payments, goods, or services constitutes a type of refund or rebate and must be applied as a reduction of the providers costs for goods or services purchased from the vendor. 4. Where the purchasing function for a provider is performed by a central unit or organization, all discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates must be credited to the costs of the provider ~A-aeeeFSaAee-wttR--tRe--tAstF~etteAs--aeeve~---tRese sRe~~S--Aet and may not be treated as income ef ~ the central ~~FeRastA\u00a7-f~RetteA unit or organization or used to reduce the administrative costs of tRat--f~AetteA the central unit or organization.

History: Effective January 1, 1990; amended effective January 1, 1992; November 1, 1992; November days. 585 1. A resident day is any day for which service is provided or for which payment is ordinarily sought for the available bed. The amount of remuneration has no bearing on whether a day should be counted or not. Examples of days that must be included are hospital days and therapeutic leave days. Hes~~tat-stay Medical assistance hospital days in excess of fifteen consecutive days ape not billable to the department aRe are not ee~Atea-as resident days. Medical assistance hospital days in a public institution, i.e., the state hospital or vetePaAls veterans' administration hospital, which are not billable to the department by the nursing facility, are not resident days. 2. Adequate census records must be prepared and maintained on a daily basis by the facility to allow for proper audit of the census data. The daily census records must include: a. Identification of the resident~i b. Entries for all days~--EAtP~es-aPe-Aet-te-~e-~aae, and not just by exception~i c. Identification of type of day, i.e., hospital, in-house~i d. Identification of the resident's classification~; and e. Monthly totals by resident, by classifications for all residents, and by type of day. 3. Residents admitted to the facility through a hospice program will be identified as private-pay residents for census and billing purposes. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983; September 1, 1987; January 1, 1990; November 1, 1992; determinations. 1. Each cost category actual rate is calculated using the allowable historical operating costs and adjustment factors provided for in subsection 4 divided by standardized pes~aeAtls resident days for the direct care cost category and resident days for other direct care, indirect care, and property cost categories. The actual rate as calculated is compared to the limit rate for each cost category to determine the lesser of the actual rate or the limit rate. The lesser rate is given the rate weight of one. The rate weight of one for direct care is then multiplied times the weight for each classification in subsection 5 of section 75-02-06-17 to 586 establish the direct care rate for that classification. The lesser of the actual rate or the limit rate for other direct care, indirect care, and property costs, and the adjustments provided for in subsections 2 and 3 are then added to the direct care rate for each classification to arrive at the established rate for a given classification. 2. a. fReeRt~ves~ For a facility with an acutal rate below the limit rate for indirect care costs, an incentive amount equal to seventy percent times the difference between the actual rate, exclusive of inflation indices, and the limit rate;-eMet~s~ve-ef-~Rftat~eR-~Aa~ees-feP-~eP~eas-afteP-tRe Pe~ePt in effect at the end of the year immediately preceding the rate year, up to a maximum of two dollars and sixty cents will be included as part of the indirect care cost rate. b. 9~epat~R\u00a7--MaP\u00a7~As~ A facility will receive an operating margin of three percent based on the lesser of the actual direct care and other direct care rates, exclusive of inflation indices, or the limit rate eMet~s~ve-ef--e~PPeRt ~Aftat~eR--~Aa~ees in effect at the end of the year immediately preceding the rate year. The three percent operating margin will then be added to the rate for the direct care and other direct care cost categories. c. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions a and b, for the last five months of the rate year beginning January 1, 1994, the limit rate used to determine the operating margin for the direct care cost category is thirty-one dollars and twenty-two cents, the limit rate used to determine the operating margin for the other direct care cost category is ten dollars and thirty-one cents, and the limit rate used to determine the incentive for the indirect care cost rate is twenty-three dollars and thirty-two cents. 3. Limitations. a. The department shall accumulate and analyze statistics on costs incurred by the nursing facilities. These statistics may be used to establish reasonable ceiling limitations and incentives for efficiency and economy based on reasonable determination of standards of operations necessary for efficient delivery of needed services. These limitations and incentives may be established on the basis of cost of comparable facilities and services and may be applied as ceilings on the overall costs of providing services or on specific areas of operations. It shall be the option of the department to implement the ceilings so mentioned at any time based upon the information available and under guidelines required within the regulations of title XIX. 587 b. The department will review, on an ongoing basis, aggregate payments to nursing facilities to determine that payments do not exceed an amount that can reasonably be estimated would have been paid for those services under medicare payment principles. If aggregate payments to nursing facilities exceed estimated payments under medicare, the department may make adjustments to rates to establish the upper limitations so that aggregate payments do not exceed an amount that can be estimated would have been paid under medicare payment principles. c. b~ffi~ts~ All facilities except those nongeriatric physically handicapped facilities described in North Dakota Century Code section 50-24.4-13 will be used to establish a limit rate for the direct care, other direct care, and indirect care cost categories. lR~S-t~ffi~t-Pate w~tt-8e-esta8t~sRea-~s~Ag-attewa8te--R~steP~eat--e~ePat~Ag eests--feP--tRe--aase-yeaP;-aAa-aaj~stffieAt-faetePs-feP-tRe Pate-yeaP-as-set-fePtR-~A-tR~s--s~aseet~eA~ The ~A~t~at base year is the June 30, \u00b1988 1992. lRese-t~ffi~t-Pates-ffiay-Aet-ae-Peaasea--~P~eP--te--tRe--Pate ~eP~eas--aeg~AA~A\u00a7--daA~aPy-\u00b1,--\u00b1993~--lRe-ae~aPtffieAt-w~tt Pev~ew--eeeAeffi~e--tPeAas--aAa--faetePs--affeet~Ag--A~Ps~Ag fae~t~t~es--te--aetePffi~Ae-wReA-Peaas~Ag-ef-tRe-t~ffi~ts-w~tt eee~P~ Base year costs may not be adjusted in any manner or for any reason not provided for in this subsection. (1) The limit rate for each of the cost categories will be established ~s~Ag--tRe--ffiea~aA--Pate---feP---tRe a~~Pe~P~ate--eest-eategePy-~t~s-a-f~Mea-~ePeeAtage-ef tRe-ffiea~aA-Pate~---lRe--f~Mea--~epeeAtage--~s--te--ae aetePffi~AeS as follows: (a) Historical costs for the report year ended June 30, \u00b1988 1992, as adjusted, will be used to set establish--rates for all facilities in the direct care, other direct care, and indirect care cost categories. (b) lRe For the first seven months of the rate year beginning January 1, 1994, the rates as established in subparagraph a of this paragraph will be ranked from low to high for each cost category w~tt--ae-PaAkea-fPeffi-tew-te-R~gR. The A~Aet~etR eightieth percentile ranking will be determined for the direct care and other direct care cost categories, and the seveAty-f~ftR sixtieth percentile ranking will be determined for the indirect care cost category. The rate of each facility so ranked will be multiplied times 1.05165 to establish the limit rate for each category. For the last five months of the rate year beginning January 1, 1994, the limit rate for the direct care cost category is thirty-two dollars and three cents, for the other direct care cost category is ten dollars and fifty-eight cents, and for the indirect care cost category is twenty-three dollars and ninety-three cents. (d) For the rate year beginning January 1, 1995, the limit rates established in subparagraph c will be multi lied times the consumer rice index increase as described in subsection 4 to establish the limit rate for each cost category. (e) For rate years beginning on or after January 1, 1996, the limit rate set for each cost category for the revious rate ear will be multi lied times the consumer rice index increase as described in subsection 4 if an to establish the limit rate for each cost category. A facility w~e which has an actual rate that exceeds the limit rate for-a-cost category will receive the rate for indirect care costs and property costs will be the lesser of the rate established using actual census or ninety percent of licensed bed capacity available for occupancy. A licensed bed is not available for occupancy if the licensed bed is part of a remodeling, renovation, or construction project for the period the bed is not in service. 4. Adjustment factors for direct care, other direct care, and indirect care costs. a~ Rate adjustments. a. Desk audit rate. (1) The cost report will be reviewed taking into consideration the prior years adjustments. The facility will be notified by telephone or mail of any adjustments based on the desk review. Within seven working days after notification, the facility may submit information to explain why the desk adjustment should not be made. The department will review the information and make appropriate adjustments w~~e~ aPe-aetePffi~AeS-te-ee-a~~Pe~P~ate. (2) The desk audit rate will be effective January first of each rate year unless the department specifically identifies an alternative effective date and will continue in effect until a final rate is established. (3) Until a final rate is effective, pursuant to paragraph 3 of subdivision b of this subsection, private-pay rates may not exceed the desk audit rate except as provided for in North Dakota Century Code section 50-24.4-19 or subdivision c. (4) The facility may request a reconsideration of the desk rate, pursuant to subsection 2 of North Dakota Century Code section 50-24.4-17, for purposes of establishing a pending decision rate. No decision on the request for reconsideration will be given by the department for the desk rate unless the facility has been notified that the desk rate is the final rate. (5) The desk rate\u00b7 may be adjusted for special rates or one-time adjustments provided for in this section. (6) The des rate may be adjusted to reflect errors or omissions for the report year which result in a change of at least five cents per day for the rate weight of one. b. Final rate. 591 (1) The cost report may be field audited to establish a final rate. If no field audit is performed, the desk audit rate will become the final rate upon notification from the department. The final rate is effective January first of each rate year unless the department specifically identifies an alternative effective date. (2) The final rate will include any adjustments for nonallowable costs, errors, or omissions that result in a change from the desk audit rate of at least five cents per day for the rate weight of one eF--aA aggFegate--ef--eAe-tRe~saAa-ae++aFs-feF-tRe-fae~+~ty; wR~eRevep-~s-+ess; that are found during a field audit or are reported by the facility within twelve months of the rate yearend. (3) The private-pay rate must be adjusted to the final rate no later than the first day of the second month following receipt of notification by the department of the final rate and is not retroactive except as provided for in subdivision c of this subsection. (4) The final rate may be revised at any time for special rates or one-time adjustments provided for in this section. ~ If adjustments, errors, or omissions are found after a final rate has been established, the following procedures will be used: (a) Adjustments, errors, or omissions found within twelve months of establishment of the final rate and resulting in a change of at least five cents per day for the rate weight of one will result in a change to the final rate. The change will be applied retroactively as provided for in this section. (b) Adjustments, errors, or omissions ~A-eMeess-ef eAe-tRe~saAa--ae++aFs--feF--tRe--fae~+~ty found later than twelve months after the establishment of the final rate, and which would have resulted in a change of at least five cents per day for the rate weight of one had they been included, will be included as an adjustment in the report year that the adjustment, error, or omission was found. (c) Adjustments resulting from an audit of home office costs, and which result in a change of at least five cents per day for the rate weight of 592 one, will be included as an adjustment in the report year in which the costs were incurred. c. Pending decision rates for private-pay residents. (1) (2) (3) (4) If a facility has made a request for reconsideration, taken an administrative appeal, or taken a judicial appeal from a decision on an administrative appeal, and has provided information sufficient to allow the department to accurately calculate, on a per day basis, the effect of each of the disputed issues on the facility's rate, the department shall determine and issue a pending decision rate within thirty days of receipt of the request for reconsideration, administrative appeal, or judicial appeal. If the information furnished is insufficient to determine a pending decision rate, the department, within thirty days of receipt of the request for reconsideration, shall inform the facility of the insufficiency and may identify information that would correct the insufficiency. The department shall add the pending decision rate to the rate that would otherwise be set under this chapter, and, notwithstanding North Dakota Century Code section 50-24.4-19, the total must be the rate chargeable to private-paying residents until a final decision on the request for reconsideration or appeal is made and is no longer subject to further appeal. The pending decision rate is subject to any rate limitation that may apply. The facility shall establish and maintain records that reflect the amount of any pending decision rate paid by each private-paying resident from the date the facility charges a private-paying resident the pending decision rate. If the pending decision rate paid by a private-paying resident exceeds the final decision rate, the facility shall refund the difference, plus interest accrued at the legal rate from the date of notification of the pending decision rate, within sixty days after the final decision is no longer subject to appeal. If a facility fails to provide a timely refund to a living resident or former resident, the facility shall pay interest at three times the legal rate for the period after the refund is due. If a former resident is deceased, the facility shall pay the refund to a person lawfully administering the estate of the deceased former resident or lawfully acting as successor to the deceased former resident. If no person is lawfully 593 administering the estate or lawfully acting as a successor, the facility may make any disposition of the refund permitted by law. Interest paid under this subsection is not an allowable cost. e~ d. Adjustment of the total payment rate. The final rate as established will be retroactive to daA~aFy-f~Fst--ef--tRe Fate-yeap the effective date of the desk rate, except with respect to rates paid by private-paying residents. Rates A rate paid by ~ private-pay Fes~aeAts resident must be retroactively adjusted and the difference refunded to the resident, if the aesk--a~a~t--Fate rate paid by the private-pay resident exceeds the final rate by at least twenty-five cents per day, except that a pending decision rate is not subject to adjustment or refund until a decision on the disputed amount is made. 6. Rate payments. a. The rate as established shall be considered as payment for all accommodations and includes all items designated as routinely provided. No payments may be solicited or received from the resident or any other person to supplement the rate as established. b. The rate as established shall be paid by the department only if the rate charged to private-pay residents for semiprivate accommodations equals the established rate. If at any time the facility discounts tRe-pF~vate-pay-Fate fep--tRese-pep~eas-ef-t~~e-tRat-tRe-Fes~aeAt-~s-Aet-~A-tRe fae~+~ty rates for private-pay residents, the discounted rate will be the maximum chargeable to the department for the same seFv~ee bed type, i.e., hospital or leave days. c. If the established rate exceeds the pF~vate-pay rate charged to a private-pay resident, on any given date, the facility shall immediately report that fact to the department and charge the department at the lower rate. If payments were received at the higher rate, the facility shall, within thirty days, refund the overpayment. The refund will be the difference between the established rate and the rate charged the private-pay resident times the number of medical assistance resident days paid during the period in which the established rate exceeded the rate charged to private-pay residents, plus interest calculated at two percent over the Bank of North Dakota prime rate on any amount not repaid within thirty days. The refund provision will also apply to all duplicate billings involving the department. Interest charges on these refunds are not allowable costs. d. Peer groupings, limitations, or adjustments wR~eR-aFe based upon data received from or relating to more than one 594 facility will be effective for a rate period. Any change in the data used to establish peer groupings, limitations, or adjustments will not be used to change such peer groupings, limitations, or adjustments during the rate period, except with respect to the specific facility or facilities to which the data change relates. e. The established rate is paid based on a prospective ratesetting procedure. No retroactive settlements for actual costs incurred during the rate year which exceed the established rate will be made unless specifically provided for in this section. 7. Partial year. a. For fae~+~t~es a facility changing ownership during the rate period, the rate established for the previous owner will be retained. The rate for the next rate period following the change in ownership will be established as fe++ews: (1) For a facility with four or more months of operation under the new ownership during the report year, through use of a cost report for the period w~++-ae ~sea~; and (2) For a facility with less than four months of e~eFat~eAs operation under the new ownership during the report year, by indexing the rate established for the previous owner w~++-ae-~AeeMee forward using the adjustment factors as-set-feFtA in subsection 4. b. For a new facility, the department will establish interim rates equal to the limit rates for direct care, other direct care, and indirect care in effect for the rate year in which the facility begins operation, plus the property rate. The property rate will be calculated using projected property costs and certificate of need projected census. The interim rate will be in effect for no less than ten months and no more than eighteen months. Costs for the period in which the interim rates are effective will be used to establish final rates, which will be limited to the lesser of the interim or actual rates. If the final Fate rates for direct care, other direct care, and indirect care costs are less than the interim rates for those costs, a retroactive adjustment as provided for in subsection 5 will be made. A retroactive adjustment to the property rate will be made to adjust projected property costs to actual property costs. For the rate period following submission of any partial year cost report by a facility, census used to establish rates for property and indirect care costs will be the greater of actual census or certificate of need projected census. 595 (1) If the effective date of the interim rates is on or after tRe-f~Fst-aay-ef March first and on or before June thirtieth, the interim rates will be effective for the remainder of that rate year and will continue through June thirtieth of the subsequent rate year. The facility must file an interim cost report for the period ending December thirty-first of the year in which the facility first 'provides services. The interim cost report is due March first and is used to establish actual rates which will be effective July first of the subsequent rate year. The partial year rates established based on the interim cost report will include applicable incentives, margins, phase-ins, and adjustment factors and will not be subject to any cost settle-up. The cost reports for the report year ending June thirtieth of the current and subsequent rate years will be used to determine the final rates for the period that the interim rates were in effect. (2) If the effective date of the interim rates is on or after July first and on or before December thirty-first, the interim rates will remain in effect through the end of the subsequent rate year. The facility must file a cost report for the partial report year ending June thirtieth of the subsequent rate year. This cost report will be used to establish the rates for the next subsequent rate year. The facility must file an interim cost report for the period July first through December thirty-first of the subsequent rate year. The interim cost report is due on March first and is used, along with the report year cost report, to determine the final rates for the period that the interim rates were in effect. (3) If the effective date of the interim rate is on or after January first and on or before February twenty-ninth, the interim rates will remain in effect through the end of the rate year in which the interim rates become effective. The facility must file a cost report for the period ending June thirtieth of the current rate year. This cost report will be used to establish the rates for the subsequent rate year. The facility must file an interim cost report for the period July first through December thirty-first of the current rate year. The interim cost report is due on March first and is used, along with the report year cost report, to determine the final rates for the period that the interim rates were in effect. 596 1!1 The final rates established under this subdivision will be limited to the lesser of the limit rates for the current rate year or the actual rates. c. For a facility with renovations or replacements in excess of one hundred thousand dollars, and without a significant capacity increase, the rates established for direct care, other direct care, and indirect care, based on the last report year, plus a property rate calculated based on projected property costs and imputed census fpe~-tRe--+ast Pe~ePt--yeaP, must be applied to all licensed beds. The projected property rate will be effective at the time the project is completed and placed into service. The property rate for the subsequent rate year will be based on projected property costs and imputed census ~~~~tea ~asea-eA-aet~a+--eeAs~s--eA--a++--+~eeAsea--eeas--eM~st~A\u00a7 eefepe--tRe-PeAevat~eA;-~f~S-A~Aety-f~ve-~ePeeAt-eee~~aAey ef-tRe-~AePease-~A-+~eeAsea-~ea-ea~ae~ty, rather than on property costs actually incurred in the report year. Imputed census is based on the greater of actual census of all licensed beds existing before the renovation or ninety percent of the available licensed beds existing prior to renovation, plus ninety-five percent of the increase in licensed bed capacity and unavailable licensed beds existing prior to the renovation. Subsequent property rates will be adjusted using this methodology, except imputed census will be actual census if actual census exceeds ninety-five percent of total licensed capacity, until such time as twelve months of property costs are reflected in the report year. d. For a facility with a significant capacity increase, the rates established for direct care, other direct care, and indirect care, based on the last report year, must be applied to all licensed beds. An interim property rate will be established based on projected property costs and projected census. The interim property rate will be effective from the first day of the month beginning after the date in which the increase in licensed beds is issued by the department of health and consolidated laboratories through the end of the rate year. The facility must file an interim property cost report following the rate year. The interim cost report is due March first and is used to determine the final rate for property and to establish the amount for a retroactive cost settle-up. The final rate for property is limited to the lesser of the interim property rate or a rate based upon actual property costs. The property rate for the subsequent rate year will be based on projected property costs and census imputed as ninety-five percent of licensed beds, rather than on property costs actually incurred during the report year; and will not be subject to retroactive costs settle-up. Subsequent property rates will be adjusted using this 597 methodology, except imputed census will be actual census if actual census exceeds ninety-five percent of total licensed capacity, until such time as twelve months of property costs are reflected in the report year. e. For a facility which has no significant capacity increase and no renovations or replacements in excess of one hundred thousand dollars, the rates based on the report year will be applied throughout the rate year for all licensed beds. facility terminating its participation in the medical assistance program, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, the department may authorize the facility to receive continued payment until medical assistance residents can be relocated to facilities participating in the medical assistance program. 8. One-time adjustments. a. Adjustments to meet certification standards. (1) The department may provide for an increase in the established rate for additional costs that are incurred to meet certification standards. The survey conducted by the state department of health and consolidated laboratories must clearly require that the facility take steps to correct deficiencies dealing with resident care. The plan of correction must identify the salary and other costs that will be increased to correct the deficiencies cited in the survey process. (2) The facility must submit a written request to the medical services division within thirty days of submitting the plan of correction to the state 598 department of health and consolidated laboratories. The request must eeAtatA-tAe-fe~~ewtA\u00a7-tAfepffiatteA: (a) A Include a statement that costs or staff numbers have not been reduced for the report year immediately preceding the state department of health and consolidated laboratories certification survey~i (b) lAe Identify the number of new staff or additional staff hours and the associated costs that will be required to meet the certification standards~; and (c) A Provide a detailed list aAB-tffi~~effieAtatteA of any other costs necessary to meet survey standards. (3) The department will review the submitted information and may request additional documentation or conduct onsite visits. If an increase in costs is approved, the established rate will be adjusted ~~waPa to an amount not to exceed the limit rate. (4) Any additional funds provided must be used in accordance with the facilitys written request to the department and are subject to audit. If the department determines that the funds were not utilized for the intended purpose, an adjustment will be made in accordance with subsection 5. b. Adjustments for unforeseeable expenses. (1) The department may provide for an increase in the established rate for additional costs that are incurred to meet major unforeseeable expenses. Such expenses must be resident related and must be beyond the control of those responsible for the management of the facility. (2) The facility must submit a written request containing the following information to the medical services division within sixty days after first incurring the unforeseeable expense: (a) An explanation as to why the facility believes the expense was unforeseeable~i (b) An explanation as to why the facilitys management believes the expense was beyond the managerial control of the facility~; and 599 (c) A detailed breakdown of the unforeseeable expenses by expense line item. (3) The department will base its decision on whether the request clearly demonstrates that the economic or other factors that caused the expense were unexpected and arose because of conditions that could not have been anticipated by management based on their background and knowledge of nursing care industry and business trends. (4) The department will review the submitted information and may request additional documentation or conduct onsite visits. If an increase in costs is approved, the established rate will be adjusted upward not to exceed the limit rate. \u00b7 (5) Any additional funds provided must be used to meet the unforeseeable expenses outlined in the facilitys request to the department and are subject to audit. If the department determines that the funds were not utilized for the intended purpose, an adjustment will be made in accordance with subsection 5. c. Adjustment to historical operating costs. (1) A facility may receive a one-time adjustment to historical operating costs when the facility has been found to be significantly below care-related minimum standards described in subparagraph a of paragraph 2 of this subdivision and when it has been determined that the facility cannot meet the minimum standards through reallocation of costs and efficiency incentives. (2) The following conditions must be met before a facility can receive the adjustment: (a) The facility shall document that based on nursing hours and standardized resident days, the facility cannot provide a minimum of one and two-tenths nursing hours per standardized resident day~i (b) The facility shall document that all available resources, including efficiency incentives, if used to 1ncrease nursing hours, are not sufficient to meet the minimum standards~; and (c) The facility shall submit a written plan describing how the facility will meet the minimum standard if the adjustment is received~ lRe-~+aA, which must include the number and type Gee of staff to be added to the current staff and the projected cost for salary and fringe benefits for the additional staff. (3) The adjustment will be calculated based on the costs necessary to increase nursing hours to the minimum standards less any operating margins and incentives included when calculating the established rate. The net increase will be divided by standardized resident days and the amount calculated will be added to the actual rate. This rate will then be subject to any rate limitations that may apply. (4) If the facility fails to implement the plan to increase nursing hours to one and two-tenths hours per standardized resident day, the amount included as the adjustment will be adjusted in accordance with the methodologies set forth in subsection 5. (5) If the actual cost of implementing the plan exceeds the amount included as the adjustment, no retroactive settlement will be made. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective July 1, 1981; December 1, 1983; July 1, 1984; September 1, 1987; January 1, 1990; April 1, 1991; January 1, 1992; November 1, 1992; Classifications. 1. Any resident, except respite care residents, occupying a licensed nursing facility bed must have a resident classification review. 2. Residents will be classified in one of sixteen classes based on a resident classification review. If Ae a resident classification review is not performed feP--a-Fes~aeA~ in accordance with subsection~ except for ~ respite care Pes~aeA~s resident, the resident must be classified as special care B until the next required review is performed in accordance with subsection 3 for purposes of determining standardized resident days. Res~aeA~s A resident, except for a respite care Pes~aeA~s resident, who Rave has not been classified must be billed at the reducea-- physical functioning A established rate. Res~~~e A respite care pes~aeA~s resident who aPe is not classified will be given a weight of one and five-tenths when determining standardized resident days. 3. Reviews must be conducted as follows: 601 a. The facility will review the resident within the first seven days after any admission or return from a an acute hospital stay. b. The facility will review the resident after twenty-five days, but within thirty days after any admission or return from a an acute hospital stay. c. The facility will review each resident twice each year. The reviews will be conducted six months apart and will be done according to a schedule established by the department for each report year. d. The seven-day Pev~ews review will take precedence over the thirty-day Pev~ews review and the biannual Pev~ews review, and the thirty-day Pev~ews -review will take precedence over the biannual Pev~ews review. For example, if resident A was admitted on June first and the aAA~at ffiea~ea~a biannual review was eA in June iA~Pa, resident A would not be included in the June iA~Pa biannual review. On the other hand, if the aAA~at-ffiea~ea~a biannual review was eA the second full week in July iA~Pa, resident A would be included, even though he or she had just had a thirty-day facility review on June thirtieth. 4. The resident classification review is to be completed based on the following criteria: a. Assign point values for a resident's activities of daily living in the areas of: (1) Eating -the process of getting food by any means into the body. (2) Transfer -the process of moving between positions. (3) Toileting -all processes involved with toileting. b. Determine each resident's clinical group using the following hierarchy of criteria: (1) Heavy rehabilitation to qualify for heavy rehabilitation, a resident must require and receive restorative physical or occupational therapy five times per week for a minimum of two and one-half hours per week or requires and is receiving intensive bowel or bladder retraining. Residents receiving therapy wA~eA--~s separately reimbursable by a third party cannot be included in this group. (2) Special care -to qualify for special care, a resident must not qualify as heavy rehabilitation and must have an activity of daily living score of five 602 or more and one or more of the following conditions or treatments: (a) Stage 4 decubitus. (b) Comatose. (c) Suctioning. (d) Nasal gastric feeding. (e) Parenteral feeding. (f) Quadriplegia. (g) Multiple sclerosis. (h) Ventilator dependent. (3) Clinically complex -to qualify for clinically complex, a resident must not qualify as special care and must have one or more conditions or treatments characteristic of special care with an activity of daily living score of three or four; or must not qualify for special care and must have one or more of the following conditions or treatments: (a) Dehydration. (b) Internal bleeding. (c) Stasis ulcer. (d) Terminally ill. (e) Daily oxygen. (f) Wound care. (g) Chemotherapy. (h) Transfusion. (i) Dialysis. (j) Daily respiratory care. (k) Cerebral palsy. (1) Urinary tract infection. (m) Hemiplegia. 603 (4) Special eeRavtePat--Aeeas behavior -to qualify for special eeRavtePat-Aeeas behavior, a resident must not qualify for clinically complex and must have one of the following conditions: (a) Verbal disruption -level 4+. (b) Physical aggression -level 4+. (c) Disruptive, infantile, or socially inappropriate -level 4+. (d) Hallucinations -level 2+. (5) Reduced physical functioning - a resident who does not qualify for special behavior will be classified as reduced physical functioning. For a resident who has a level 4+ rating for general behavior, one point will be added to the activity of daily living score assigned in subdivision a of subsection 4. 5. Based on the resident classification review, each resident will be classified into a case-mix class with a corresponding case-mix weight as follows: a. Heavy rehabilitation A; b. g. Clinically complex Clinically complex eeRavtePat--Aeeas Special eeRavtePat--Aeeas Reduced physical Reduced physical functioning n. Reduced physical functioning 1.48. o. Reduced physical functioning D; p. Reduced physical functioning E; case-mix weight: 2.21. 6. The classification is effective the date the review is completed in all cases except for the admission review. The admission review is effective the date of admission. History: Effective September 1, 1987; amended effective January 1, 1990; November 22, Reviewer criteria. 1. The resident classification review form must be completed by a licensed practical nurse or registered nurse who has completed a training program approved by the department, and is certified by the department. 2.

The income tax exemption may be claimed by an individual taxpayer on North Dakota form 37. s~ 7. A taxpayer with both exempt and nonexempt activities shall --prorate its income pursuant to the provisions of North Dakota Century Code chapter 57-38.1. a. If the taxpayer has only North Dakota activity, exempt income must be determined by multiplying income from all activities, exempt and nonexempt, by a fraction, the 619 EXAMPLE: Facts: Property Payroll Sales numerator of which is the sum of its exempt property, sales, and payroll factors and the denominator of which is three. Exempt Plant $ 5,000,000 750,000 20,000,000 Other North Dakota Activity $10,000,000 1,000,000 35,000,000 North Dakota Activity $15,000,000 1,750,000 55,000,000 Apportionable income $50,000,000 Computing North Dakota exempt income Apportionment factor relating to exempt activities: Property factor = $ 5,000,000 Payroll factor = $ 750,000 Sales factor = $20,000,000 $15,000,000 = exempt activities $50,000,000 Apportionable income $18,759,000 Exempt income b. Computing North Dakota exempt income of multistate business requires two steps. (1) Compute North Dakota income including both exempt and nonexempt activities in the apportionment factor and in apportionable income. Multistate corporation Facts: Utilize the same facts in the above example, and add: Total activity within and without North Dakota Property Payroll Sales .$100, 000,000 $ 5,000,000 $200,000,000 Apportionment factor, including tax-exempt activity Property Factor = $ 15,000,000 Payroll Factor = $ 1,750,000 Sales Factor = $ 55,000,000 $100,000,000 = .15 $ 5,000,000 = .35 $200,000,000 = .275 .775 620 3 = .258333 $50,000,000 X .25833 $12,916,650 North Dakota income (2) Apply a second factor to North Dakota income computed in the first step. The second factor is computed in the same way as in subdivision a, as a ratio of exempt North Dakota activity to total North Dakota activity. $12,916,650 North Dakota income x .37518 Apportionment factor of exempt activities $ 4,846,069 North Dakota exempt income c. When a partial exemption on a project or plant has been granted, the percentage of the projects nonexempt property, payroll, and sales would be added to the other North Dakota taxable activitys factors. For instance, a twenty percent exemption would mean eighty percent of the projects property, payroll, and sales would be added to the other North Dakota factors creating a taxable activity. d. When a company has only one operating facility which has been granted a partial exemption, North Dakota taxable income shall be computed based on total income of the operation, and a percentage of the income which is equal to the percentage of the exemption shall be deducted from the total.

Casual or occasional sales made by an individual are not subject to sales tax. Sales made in the course of a regularly conducted business are subject to sales tax. The following are retailers who must collect and remit sales tax: 1. The auctioneer who auctions the belongings of several undisclosed individuals at a public auction. 2. Persons who buy antiques from others and offer them for sale at a public auction or through a private sale. 3. Persons who conduct permanent rummage sales through which they dispose of the property of others. A retailer may not claim a casual sale if the property sold is similar to property sold by the retailer in the regular course of business. A person selling ones own products occasionally is making casual sales, and such sales are not taxable. Sales of such number, volume, or frequency as to indicate that the sale is not a casual or isolated one are subject to tax. The sale of a business or the assets of a business is a casual sale and no sales tax is due. If the business being sold is a retail business and the business will continue as a retail business, the inventory is considered to be sold for resale while the sale of the other business assets is considered to be a casual sale. Sale of a retail inventory through auction is subject to section 81-04.1-04-11. History: Effective June 1, 1984; amended effective August Manufacturing or agricultural processing is a process which produces a new article with a different form, use, and name. The modification of articles of tangible personal property is not manufacturing or processing. For example, the creation of steel ducts or !-beams is manufacturing whereas the modification of steel ducts or !-beams to meet the specifications of a particular real property construction contract is not manufacturing or processing. To be considered manufacturing or processing, the raw materials must be materially altered. By way of illustration and not of limitation, the following are manufacturers or agricultural processors: food, beverage, confectionary plants; grain mills; bakeries; textile mills; apparel makers; wood and 631 lumber plants; furniture and fixture makers; paper product makers; printers and publishers (includes newspapers); chemical producers; leather good plants; stone, clay, glass, concrete product makers; cement and asphalt plants; metal ware makers; auto/aircraft makers; dairy processors (not producers); photo finishers (not photographers); and dental, medical, ophthalmolic labs. By way of illustration and not of limitation, the following are not manufacturers or agricultural processors: farmers or ranchers, construction contractors, refining companies, artists, utilities, nurseries, restaurants, pharmacists, drycleaners, photographers, advertisement agencies, secretarial services, computer programmers, auto body shops, repair shops, radio and television stations, architects, jewelers, grain elevators, and tire retreaders or recappers. Machinery and equipment used directly in the manufacturing process includes molds and dies that determine the physical characteristics of the finished product or its packaging material, and computers and related peripheral equipment that directly control or measure the manufacturing process. Machinery and equipment used directly in the manufacturing process also includes temperature or humidity control equipment necessary to maintain certain levels of temperature or humidity in a limited area of the processing or manufacturing facility where either temperature or humidity must be closely regulated for the proper function or production process to occur. For example, in certain food processing plants, maintenance of high levels of humidity are necessary during part of the process. Therefore, equipment or machinery used to create or maintain necessary humidity levels is exempt as manufacturing or processing equipment. Equipment or machinery used for general heating or cooling . of the facility or air-conditioning or air exchange equipment does not qualify for the tax exemption. Items which are consumed or destroyed in the manufacturing process but which do not become a part of the finished product cannot be considered machinery and equipment and consequently are subject to the general sales and use tax. Purchase of these items by a manufacturer is taxable, and suppliers shall charge sales or use tax on these consumable items. If the items are purchased from an out-of-state supplier or if a North Dakota supplier fails to charge the tax, the North Dakota manufacturer shall report the sales or use tax directly to the North Dakota tax commissioner. Machinery and equipment not used directly in the manufacturing process or in agricultural processing include repair parts, equipment used for storage, delivery to and from the plant, repairing or maintaining facilities, research and development, or environmental control equipment required to maintain certain levels of R~ffi~S~ty; teffi~eFat~Fe;--eF air quality in a manufacturing or agricultural processing plant. 632 11Recycling11 means collecting or recovering waste material and processing it so it becomes a raw material or another product for sale. Machinery and equipment used directly in recycling of tangible personal property includes pulverizers, shredders, balers, granulators, separators, and conveyors. The machinery and equipment must be used solely and exclusively in affecting material as a part of the recycling process. Motor vehicles used to collect material to be recycled do not qualify for the exemption nor does transportation equipment such as forklift trucks used to load or unload material either before it is recycled or after the recycling process. Items consumed or destroyed in the recycling process but which do not become a part of the finished product are not considered recycling machinery or equipment and are subject to sales tax when purchased for use by the recycler. Requests for approva] to buy goods without paying tax or for refunds of tax paid on goods which qualify for exemption must be made in writing to the tax commissioner. The tax commissioner reserves the right to make an onsite inspection prior to granting permission to purchase qualifying goods without paying tax or to receiving a refund. The tax commissioners approval to purchase goods without paying tax or to grant a refund is binding unless a further review or additional information indicates that the decision was made upon misrepresentation by the applicant. An onsite inspection by the tax commissioner does not preclude an audit of the taxpayers books and records.

Before determining whether the tax imposed by North Dakota Century Code section 57-43.2-03 applies, the licensed special fuels or liquefied petroleum dealer must make a good faith effort to assure that the special fuels user intends to use the fuel exclusively for one of the exempt purposes. If after the fuel is sold, it is determined that a special fuels user used all or part of the fuel for a purpose that does 638 not qualify for the two percent excise tax, the tax commissioner may assess the fuels user for additional tax, penalty, and interest.

General Authority: Work-over exemption. Oil produced from a qualifying well that has been worked over is exempt from the oil extraction tax for a consecutive twelve-month period starting with the first day of the third month after completion of the work-over project. The twelve-month period runs consecutively from the first day of the third month after completion of the work-over project, even though all or a portion of the exemption may be rendered ineffective by the oil price trigger discussed below. To be eligible for this exemption, a taxpayer shall submit a work-over qualification letter signed by a representative of the industrial commission. This qualification letter must state that the work-over project meets the requirements set forth in North Dakota Century Code section 57-51.1-03. The letter must also provide the following information: 1. The name of the lease. 2. The location of the well. 3. The name of the party entitled to the tax exemption. 4. The date the notice of intention was filed. 5. The average daily production of the well during the latest six calendar months of continuous production. 6. The cost of the work-over project. 7. The average daily production of the well during the first sixty days after completion of the work-over project, if a~~t~eaete the cost of the work-over project is sixty-five thousand dollars or less. 8. The dates on which the work-over project was performed. The commissioner will accept the information provided in the qualification letter subject to confirmation upon audit. If the average price of a barrel of crude oil, as defined in subsection 2 of North Dakota Century Code section 57-51.1-01, is thirty-three dollars or more, the exemption is eliminated on all wells beginning the first day of the first month following that five-month period. If the above trigger provision does occur, and the average price of oil then declines below thirty-three dollars per barrel for any subsequent consecutive five-calendar-month period, the exemption is reinstated for all qualifying wells beginning the first day of the first 643 month following the five months of prices below thirty-three dollars per barrel. History: Effective March 1, 1990; amended effective June 1, 1992i August 1, NDCC 57-51.1-03 81-99-93-99. Trigger provision applicable to reduced oil extraction tax rate. Oil produced from a new well, or a well that receives a work-over exemption after June 30, 1993, or a qualifying secondary or tertiary recovery project and not otherwise exempt is subject to tax at a reduced extraction tax rate of four percent. However, if the average price of a barrel of crude oil is thirty-three dollars or more, for any consecutive five-calendar-month period, the oil extraction tax rate for the aforementioned production increases to six and one-half percent starting with the first day of the first month following the five-month period where the average price was thirty-three dollars or more. If the oil extraction tax rate is increased from four to six and one-half percent, and after the increase, the average price of oil declines to less than thirty-three dollars per barrel during any subsequent five-calendar-month period, the rate of tax reverts to four percent starting with the first day of the first month following the five-month period where the average price was less than thirty-three dollars.
